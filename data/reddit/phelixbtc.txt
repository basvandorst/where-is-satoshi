The problem with the current implementation is that it will be accepted by RBF unaware wallets by default. This will mean a hurtfull transition phase until all wallets are updated.
@_date: 2015-12-01 09:02:53
If I understand correctly RBF tx are being accepted by RBF unaware wallets. **Would it be possible to implement RBF in a way such that RBF unaware recipient wallets reject RBF tx?** This is what I would call opt-in - with the current implementation recipients are forced to update their wallets, aren't they?

**Will Bitcoin Core display unconfirmed RBF transactions, if so will they be specifically marked as such?**

reward + fees = hardware + power + maintenance + profit  
  
assuming:  
profit = 0  
4000 standard txs per 1mb block  
average fee: 0,5mBTC (high)  
power ~=~ hardware + maintenance (very wild guess)  
  
--&gt; tx_price = (reward + fees) / 4000  ~=~  3.6mBTC  
--&gt; tx_power_price = tx_price / 2  ~=~ 1.8mBTC  
  
Note electricity used for mining is usually very cheap as it only then can be profitable. Now somebody do the calculation from the hashrate side.

You wouldn't mind if China starts censoring the blockchain?  
If you think you can create a better client, please go ahead. I will run it if it turns out superior. The thing is, the core guys are very good developers and have way more experience than anyone else. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:30:19
I think you are missing some points:  
- Miners may act unreasonably or have a different point of view (see below)  
- The Bitcoin blockchain may completely stall when loosing a very large part of the hashrate (this assumption might give miners a feeling of superiority and they may be right)  
- In case of a stall Core might be forced to hardfork with different PoW to keep the chain going. Though I know who I would bet on it would be a ruff ride for sure. The upside might be a less centralized mining eco system. The downside a lower price and scorched SPV and old wallets earth.  
  
So while that statement was certainly helpful the cow is not yet completely off the ice.

@_date: 2017-03-19 19:32:25
Racism, really?  
Take a look at the current hashrate distribution, with a little digging you will find out that more than 67% are located in a single country. This is pretty bad on my list.

Are you saying you did not know about the id/ namespace?
The archive links to namecoin.org are meaningless since it was not yet an official site of the project back then. 
If you say there was limited documentation available the question remains why you did not simply ask about it.
@_date: 2015-11-18 23:22:00
Phelix from the Namecoin team here. The issues described are just symptoms of Namecoin's still experimental nature and it's very small number of actual users. With a growing userbase and resulting rise in price these issues would improve. To achieve this we work on usability (note the latest NMControl release) and explore new applications like resolving Tor/I2P human readable names, PGP key lookup, file signing and some more.
Btw, I am still waiting for OneName to explain how pruning or SPV will work with their new system (that needs to piggyback the Bitcoin blockchain). Unlike them we don't have an undisclosed business model, we are just volunteers creating ethical software in our spare time.
Namecoin is a Bitcoin friendly altcoin, sharing the very latest Bitcoin codebase with some features added. You are welcome to join us on the Namecoin forum - here it is way easier to get creative and make an impact (maybe start with looking at the bounties).

Even though your company profited from our work for years you never contributed anything productive to Namecoin. Instead you bothered everybody by cloning our id/ namespace. Now that you move you spread false information about us. I think many people can relate how behaviour like this can stir emotions. Still we try to stay factual and it would be nice if you could do so, too.
    
We are looking forward to your explanation on how pruning or SPV will work with your new system.
Piggybacking Bitcoin without users wanting it and with Satoshi having clearly stated it should not be done seems a risk to me. If you call this FUD then it should be easy for you to bring up actual arguments. How much space have you used so far in the Bitcoin blockchain? The moral point left aside, "obfuscation" is hard to imagine in a decentralized way.
Btw, Could you explain your business model? If you don't want to answer or it's confidential you might have to live with people speculating about it.
In case you should run into problems you are still welcome to Namecoin. I wonder how things would have turned out if we had worked together on a single namespace. Communication is key, we will try to more actively reach out in the future.

Latley I got the impression, too, that Core got less stable on Windows. I had to reindex a couple of times. Did not look like Hardware issues / anti virus to me. 
Pull the plug (kill the process?) and you have to reindex.
It's a dilemma all the good developers move to Linux.
