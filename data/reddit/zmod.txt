People investing more money than they own into bitcoin right now when the price could very easily drop to below $300 within 24hours.
I really hope people don't spend more than they own but I'm afraid it's going to happen..

Well it went down to $380 for a week when it hit $960 ish, probably due to all of the sell orders.

Ah ok, well it COULD happen, all it takes is one piece of bad news and it will plummet. 
I'm not saying it WILL drop below $300 within 24hours.. but it could very easily happen.

Except we're not, it looks like you have just found this chart online and you're posting it to try and look clever.

Go through every old email and search for bitcoin, exchange, coin, bit, currency, digital etc.. everything like that and look for clues!
I hope you find it! I'd be going nuts if I were you right now!

If a country made bitcoin illegal to possess then it would take a major hammering, maybe not under $300 from $780 but it would definitely lose a lot in value.
But even so, this isn't a sure profit investment, people need to realise that.

ITT: Loads of people who like to think they are financial experts.

Is there any site which lets me bank transfer instantly? or at least within a few hours?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:00:57
Well it just went down to $385... 11 hours after you posted that.. 
It will probably go back over $600 now but yeah... just shows it can happen without much really happening.

It seems you're the one who isn't very good at this ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:15:18
I love how everyone has turned in to a financial expert all of a sudden.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:15:56
Yeah.. right.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:43:10
Probably.. but we're not even at where he put as at... 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:15:13
So you think Bitcoins will never go down in price again?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:28:23
Thanks for that useless piece of information.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:52:54
So you think that someone wont spend more money than they have on bitcoins? because it has already happened.. a LOT of times.. especially last April.. don't you remember the posts about people feeding suicidal due to losing so much?

I just feel sorry for the people who are about to get fucked over.
