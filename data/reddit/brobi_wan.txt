One thing bitcoin doesn't have to worry about. 
Why are people not allowed to speculate on a currency? I'm sure their were some lucky Germans who exchanged their marks for something else before it became useless.

Well they do sorry to burst your bubble

Lol at the fags downvoting me because they don't like the truth. 
I completely agree that the transaction fees have temporarily screwed up the currency part. Once that's hopefully solved I don't see what's stopping it from going back to a normal currency like it was before $2+ transaction fees.

Check out the value of German marks in 1923.

Tf is this lol. The fucking price is sub 4K.. if you’re pumped about the price right now you might be retarded. This is more annoying than anything because I check the price expecting change.

Riiiiight ok I thought that was the case. I was so confused at how you thought your forks would be as valuable as the main fork. I figure coin base and exodus wallet will handle the forks me but I need to do a little more research before the fork happens

I feel like this is wrong but I don't know enough to disprove it. If it's correct then bitcoin is in serious trouble.
