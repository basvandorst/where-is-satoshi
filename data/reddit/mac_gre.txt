He might make a few thousand dollars off the 3 bitcoin he purchased before he has to pay off his debt. Or it might crash back to $1000 and he's left holding bags that he owes interest on.

There's no where to have this conversation besides /pol/ either and that doesn't leave much room for middle ground due to how extreme it is. I went down the / pol/ rabbit hole for a couple years and while there is a lot of truth there, there's also fanatacism and blind hate
