The 2FA on the withdrawal would stop it, yes. I'm only talking about the login process, since that applies to just about any web application.

You've described exactly the scenario I have already stated as the situation 2FA wouldn't work. And it still heavily relies on how the information about the withdrawal is given in the email or whether just another password is used and plenty more factors. 
To quote the same thing I mentioned on another comment:

An immensely more complex phishing operation would have to be performed, to the point that it might be worthwhile to attempt, but most phishing scams have only a few operating static webpages which send the form data to a service to gain access to the account. It still is completely possible to emulate more than just the login page to the point that operations beyond login can be performed in the phishing site, such as 2FA support for withdrawals. Data pertinent to your account can be scraped, or the entire webpage handed over with links swapped or the backend call structure replicated, for example. 
**I'm merely stressing the importance that users continue to be attentive about phishing attempts, *even if they have 2FA enabled*.** With some accounts containing thousands to millions of dollars, a month of work to replicate a website in a complex phishing attempt would absolutely be worth their time.

Once again, they can use the same information you've given them to initiate that connection themselves, causing the 2FA authentication prompt (be it email, app, sms) which you would enter into this phishing site yourself. At this point they would have gained access and you would be none the wiser except for maybe an IP address listed in the email to you, which technically they could try to reduce suspicion of with a VPN connection to that region. 
The different password for withdrawals **would** be a stopper here though, unless they emulated the site to near entirety. Any actions you perform through the phishing site could be used to perform real-time operations on the actual website. It's really a matter of how in-depth the phishing operation is. 
Edit: The withdrawal portion I'm talking about is managing an online session until the user *maybe* asks for a withdrawal, at which point the user would input the 2FA/password and the phishing operation would use that to actually withdraw/transfer to their accounts.

It's not meant to come off as aggressive in any way, just trying to clarify the point I'm making for others to stay safe online. 2FA is a great tool, but it shouldn't result in letting your guard down.

Just so you know, 2FA would not have helped you here. The code you input to the phishing site could have immediately been used to open a session with the real one.

Except the actual code isn't being used.. it's being sent to the phishing service which then actually uses the code.
