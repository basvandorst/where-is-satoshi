It depends on your country of residence. In many countries after a year the earnings are taxfree anyways. But the question is what the tax authority will say if you suddenly have $5m appear out of nowhere when Bitcoin reaches $1m.

people have been waiting for crashes a long time now.... its hard to say. maybe $5000 is a peak for now and it will go down to $2000 or even less. but probably not because there is only 32m bitcoin ever and more and more people invest in it, ... but with some smaller coins you probably could be making way more profit. I also do see some smaller coins as quite interesting in case bitcoin does crash and people look for safe heavens.

Localbitcoins (meet traders offline).
  
Some Bitcoin ATM do not require ID/phone.
  
You can also buy bitcoins thru the usual ways, and then use a bitcoin mixer/tumbler to store them safely elsewhere, where nobody will know its yours.

You should make your own decisions

The support of shapeshift always should reply. Contact them again and thru other ways. Did you not give a refund address?
  
Also if you send your bitcoin to a wrong address, that cannot accept bitcoin, there is ways to actually retrieve it.

there has been some recent success stories where people turned $5k into $1m with neo and other coins.  maybe not so popular here, but i would suggest to just buy a couple of the better altcoins if you want to start in crypto, and of course a little bit of btc too.
