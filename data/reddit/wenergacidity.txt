$1450 around Christmas, might dip abit when New Years hits, then it'll probably climb back up

Mining at 16-17 Mhash is incredibly slow. You will never make a sizable amount of Bitcoins at that speed, you'll probably lose money due to the electricity it costs to run the PC/miner.

I posted earlier today on r/bitcoin about how today was the first time I boarded the Bitcoin train! Today I bought my first partial bitcoin and I'm very excited to be part of making history. As for the people wondering why I only bought part of a Bitcoin: I'm a graduate student in Sweden so therefore I do not have a lot to spend! As for the future, it would be nice to see Bitcoin's value go up even more, but for now it just feels great to be part of this.
\o/ hello fellow bitcoin-owners!

Counter article: The bitcoin rise of 2013. 
Stop with these articles already, if you take a look at the growth bitcoin has made throughout 2013 this 'dip' is nothing.

Thank you for that image, otherwise I would not have known what you meant.

I guess the description on your right is quite good.
"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank."

Unfortunately I was quite late to the party, but I wanted to be part of Bitcoin regardless of its value. I'm a graduate student so I would invest more, but can't (due to limited funds). However, I am proud to say that I'm the owner of 0,11 BTC.

and  would be the face of all the people missing out/hating on Bitcoin
