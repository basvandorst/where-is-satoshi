It is only a small part of the infographic and Tiger Woods is the most extreme example in the table. It is merely a way to   get people to easily understand the magnitude of the extraordinary growth in value of Bitcoin by relating it to a very well known public figure - just throwing numbers around does often not accomplish this very well.

I completely agree - however, it has value as it functions quite effectively as a hook to get people interested in and learning about Bitcoin.

tl;dr Good advice for Bitcoin sports bettors - Don’t buy into the panic, Understand the nature of the coin, Don’t bother trying to understand what caused the crash/spike, Stay disciplined, Don’t change your betting strategy, Find other assets to invest in, Get some perspective, Ride it out

That is just a PR rep standard response to queries like that - by no means any official announcement...
