Since January BTC percentage of the entire crypto market has increased from 36.1% to 42.2% (today), and prices have been bearish since. What is the significance behind this? Anyone wanna put some thoughts?

BTC dominance of Crypto Market: 
December 2017: 55%
January 2018: 33% 
Today: 45% and still increasing
To everyone thinking if BTC is dead, think again. Prices are low but bitcoin is slowly monopolising the market again. This means institutions are dumping their BTC loads and the market is diversifying to smaller investors. This is a good sign for BTC stability. The big guys knew it was going to bottom twice, no market bottoms once and turns into a bull immediately. Stop letting your emotions override you, just be responsible with your investments.

At times like these, it is important to remember that Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. It is rising at an alarming rate and it won't last. Be responsible with your investments and do not bulk buy, a sell off can happen any time. Our goal here is for a stable rise in value, it is unrealistic to think Bitcoin will go on another parabola. Invest responsibly!

I think a public act like this is needed. We need capable, competent and brilliant scientists working towards the future of cryptos, not con men like Craig Wright. Crypto is highly unregulated, whose going to call him out to tell the truth? Since he claimed he was Satoshi he's done nothing for the crypto community but used the profits to create his own company and sell his 'blockchain' services to people. Vitalik did the right thing, if he doesn't call fakes out like Craig, no one else will or can. This is for building a future for a sustainable crypto market, a man like Craig can be very dangerous if we ignore him
