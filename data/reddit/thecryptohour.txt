Interesting point, im sure many do lose money, but i found this interesting since he was on the money last year when he said bitcoin was unequivocally the best investment, despite it already going up 300%. 
So having listened to him a few times, i believe he is clever and worth listening to. Not saying his predictions will be right, he could be completely wrong, but so could anyone. 
Still, I like to listen and think about other peoples opinions and actually listen, rather than immediately dismissing. Sorry to hear you thought it was a waste of time.

Sure thing pal, I hope you can understand my Irish accent ��  let me know when you start, I’m happy to give advice, even though I’m relatively new to it too.

It’s my opinion that institutions and funds are late to a market, for the first time ever. And that’s Crypto. Particularly bitcoin.
From listening to and reading what they are saying, it’s pretty clear to me that they want in, whether they are manipulating price, I’m not sure, but there is an element of fear in the market, which increases irrationality, but there has always been irrationality in bitcoin, “the stairs up and an elevator down” is a common expression to describe the charts. 
I think it’s important to keep in mind too, bitcoin isn’t only a fixed supply, it’s actually a depreciating in supply because people keep losing their keys.
Long term I see this as a store of value, no doubt, having money in bitcoin is a far better option going forward than storing your money in, art for instance or gold. 
So long term, yah. If I was a whale. I’d want it to be worth as much as possible.

Well, u/Sir_Fappleton if you're buying bitcoin to make money, its effectively gambling.
But long term, its my opinion that price will break all time high, but that make take weeks, months or a few years. Nobody knows. Im not sure about short term, you need to ask yourself how long are you planning to hold, and whats your pain tolerance for being underwater and holding at a loss. 
Nobody knows what price will go to, we all have opinions based on whatever research we have done, I can only suggest you do the same, and see how you feel about risking that $50. Good luck with it

Yeah u/hyperhappy2 I would suggest you just go and do it. 
I started doing my crypto content a few months back on YouTube and I’ve just started a podcast. The best thing I ever did was just get started, it seems people get stuck with deliberating and trying to please everyone, but there are so many people on this sub, that it will be impossible to cover what everyone wants, so do what you would like to hear, and you will inevitably be doing something that others are interested in too.
Best of luck :)

yeah same man, theres something very satisfying about seeing your bitcoin on a wallet on your phone, and knowing its going from you, direct to the person.
With no bank taking a fee or deciding if youre good for it. 
I know a few bar owners who are beginning to enquire a lot to me, and i keep telling them, they dont need to buy, just start earning it by letting people pay with it. Cut out the bank taking that processing fee and chargeback risks

Hey, so i have a YouTube channel which helps people understand all of this, from what is bitcoin, how is BTC made to how to buy one or some, and why you might wanna use it.
I think you should understand it before jumping in the deep end. 
Below is a timestamp to how you can buy it, but maybe watch it all and use the advice on this subreddit first. And please feel free to ask any more questions, we are here to help :) also r/bitcoinbeginners is a good sub for new people to ask questions.

Well said :) sometimes its easy to get lost in the hullabaloo and ever changing crypto space, and you can lose sight of what really matters.
This post was a nice reminder and im grateful for you saying it. I think we all need to remember what it is about bitcoin that makes us better, and try focus on that more, rather than the battles we find ourselves sometimes drawn into, which just feeds negativity, at least those are my thoughts.
Congrats on your engagement, the new job and im looking forward to chatting more in this sub :)

Yeah i would recommend a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor, leaving coins on an exchange like coinbase should be the last option.
But for ease of use, edge isnt a bad wallet to use either, i like their interface. also check out circles new wallet, or their old one, i think it still works with bitcoin.

A throwback to the exchanges graveyard, and why it’s dangerous to trust them. 
Let me know your thoughts :)

Haha Thanks :) I’m from Ireland, and I do these videos every week. I’m just Trying to make people laugh and inform the uninformed so they don’t get caught up in scams. Thanks for the comment :)

What do you folks think? Dont get me wrong, I think bitcoin is epic, but these are some huge claims.
It certainly would be nice for us Bitcoiners, i think the time line is probably too short though. But with the halving around the same time, maybe.
Im just curious about peoples genuine opinion about people like this, and how main stream do you think bitcoin can go?
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:23:10
hahah i like him too. hes a hunk.
I am biased though, becasue he is also me ;) glad you like it, thanks for the compliment :)

Hi, i have used coinbase and my chase account several times in the past without any issues. It has been slow on a few occasions though, sometimes several days to a week. But i havent used them for a while now, maybe over a year.
I now use gemini though, with the same chase account and i find it to be a lot smoother and a nicer interface and really fast to complete. Usually 2 days tops and its in my account.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:49:38
Yah dude, theres a lot to learn and a lot of scams etc, bitcoin is king as far as im concerned.
if youre new to crypto, you can check out my youtube channel for news and updates and stuff. Otherwise, we are here to answer questions, but investment advice, you may not get much feedback on. Its a dodgy legal area lol

Thanks for the write up, gonna take a look at this later.
It so awesome to have a main net up and running. Lightning is a game changer imo
