If I had to guess, I’d say that Satoshi has alternate accounts that he uses for day-to-day expenses.
No way you’d touch the main accounts, that could crash the market, just knowing that they *could* be sold. 
Either that or its Hal Finney and he’s dead.

Shares are more volatile than bonds, but their long-term returns are better.
Generally speaking, the more profitable the investment, the higher its volatility.

And good luck using it as an actual currency. Nobody is going to accept gold bullion as payment for any kind of everyday item.

Don’t confuse volatility with profitability. It’s not a bad investment if you’ve invested what you can afford to lose. 
Edit: new bitcoiners... it’s not called hodling because it’s easy. We know it’s going to crash again, that’s why you dollar cost average what you can afford to lose.

There's more to the west than just the USA.
The fact is Putin is running the definition of a fascist dictatorship (ie the merger of corporate and government power). Short term you can get some stuff done. Long term it's double-plus ungood.

For instance, California has SpaceX. Russia has a stagnant space sector with rampant corruption and theft of resources.

Banks will certainly need to up the interest they pay if they want people to make deposits. And without deposits they won't be making any loans.

If it can’t go on forever then it probably won’t.
Of course, if you short it then the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

It's not actually...

If you wanna know what billionaires think, read The Economist.
Say what you like about it, the readership is influential as fuck.

Or he could just defaulted on the whole pile, instead of this weird quasi-default you’re proposing.
This is legit one of the dumbest things I’ve read today. 
Edit: right, it was meant sarcastically by WAPO.

The value of any currency defaults to its underlying utility.
Green paper = the might of the US government 
Bitcoin = a rather slow, uncensorable global payment network
Gold = a universally recognized, durable, transportable store of value

If I had that much I’d be moving to Panama or somewhere similar.
Living in a tax haven starts to become worthwhile.

It won’t happen in America for a long time.
As someone said, sound (as in good) money is like water to a fish, you don’t notice it until it’s gone.

The price of space launch keeps dropping, it'll happen eventually. 
I choose my investments to work on a 30-40 year timeline, there's no way I'll invest in gold over that kind of horizon.

That's not how "just buying it all up" works. Lots of people own Bitcoin that have never sold it.
Eventually volume will drop, then prices will rise, and hodlers gonna hodl.

Just remember, "only invest what you can afford to lose" is great advice, and not for the reason that most people think it is.
Don't think in terms of "I might lose this money and never get it back". Think I'm terms of "can I emotionally handle holding on through 90% losses through to the 1000% gains on the other side, or will I cave and sell to early."

I'm all for drug liberalisation, but you're right, some are better-off banned. Heroin for addicts works great in Portugal, but the keep them out of the fentanyl.
Stimulants are the tough one. I'd have a hard time supporting legal meth, but it's hard to get addicts onto a less-harmful alternative.
Still, we can do a lot better than the current system.

Hey, they were poor as shit but they were equal.
Governments and central banks are in a shit position: we need a recession to balance things out, but the longer we put it off the more painful it becomes. 
The last recession should have been the biggest since the 30s. The next could be bigger, especially if China takes the place of 20th century Germany.

For sure, which is a likely outcome if cryptocurrency causes a financial collapse. Toxic stability or destructive war seem to be the two most common states of large-scale human civilization.

The world was far more equal by 1945 than it is today. Depression plus war does lead to greater equality.

Different situation. If the bailout hadn't occurred you in 2008 things would have been much more like the 1930s.
