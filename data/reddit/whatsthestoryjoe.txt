For some reason I imagined Amazon delivering a drone delivery straight to my house
I imagine all the helium balloons that it hits after passing a carnival and poof goes my Bitcoins lol.
(Basically its over the internet no need for an in-person delivery unless its a physical coin ^_^)

what did you expect? you thought BTC would fly under the radar forever and there would be no regulations around it? 
well that wasn't very realistic.

Articles about reddit posts are a waste of time. The fact that there is a discussion is not interesting and if you want to know what was discussed, you can read the posts.
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:59:20
apparently to the number of comments people also like to critique your equipment

Even in the worst case, if there's a huge sell of hundreds of thousands of btc, 
the price will be recovered in no time because of the buy pressure that a such low value would trigger.

I don't think he is going to use them. The system is not anonymous enough and he has too many to use a mixer effectively.
Maybe if Tor wasn't under suspicion of being compromised he could use his coins to run an anonymous mixer (coins come in, get mixed around with his) providing him with some anonymity but that also would draw legal attention for laundering.
I think it will be his next of kin that ultimately benefit.

I'd like to see one on the myth of but you spend bitcoins on anything or anywhere and a display of what you can buy and hoe easy it is to buy things with it.
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:20:12
I really wish we had something like this in the US, something that was very simple.  I'd love to be able to have my bank account $ transferred into BTC just by doing 1 click, and being able to trade it back into fiat just as easily.  I think there's a huge market there, if someone could figure out all the legal red tape.

I made a lot of bad loans in 2012. I'd assume some borrower was repaying me. Starfish BCB maybe?
Since I usually give out unique addresses to different people, I'd probably have a good idea who paid me. If the person who was given that address wasn't the person who paid me, then I'd probably keep the coins. Nobody else has any business messing with that address and if they accidentally sent BTC there it would be their loss.

something that you can't see should be called magic? and bitcoin as well? does it explains correlation between btc and magic?

So they're saying that they are immune against another mt.gox incident, as well as individual theft due to their part only. It's too bad you can't actually store your fiat on there as a reserve for day trading. All transactions are 4-day wait periods until your btc or USD clears.

It wouldn't surprise me if the CIA was behind bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies were inevitable. You might as well make the first move and control the system rather than trying to fight it down the track.
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:20:21
Maybe we'll get it on Netflix or Amazon Prime soon. That would be nice and convenient. I don't pay for either of them but if it goes to either one of those the torrent will follow within one day.

it's not the best way to use bitcoin ;)

the only way to solve this problem is to make out adequate law system, I completely agree with author

I'll never believe that only one room can accommodate 30.6% of the total network's hashrate. no matter how large it is

If there is something more profitable in the cryptoworld companies would just move there.
Currently large part of the bitcoin pushing crowd is early adoptors that ended up with vast amounts of money and obviously want to protect their investement by recycling some of it to new ventures. The quality of the ventures will eventually determine if this thing is sustainable.

The bad news is for NY residents.  Unless scaled way back many startups will simply not be able to comply.  That will leave residents of NY with less choices, more risk (unlawful entities), and higher costs.

Awesome!! Now, what are the best things to buy? I was thinking about an xbox one (can't find them on newegg), a playstation 4 (sold out). I do need a new hard drive, but what are some really cool/geeky stuff that I should pick up to reach &gt; $300? 
I'll post some stuff if I find anything interesting.

Well I'm a millennial, so I can't vouch but I hope that Jon Stewart is right. Of course I know that a lot of people will never believe his words, but who cares?
I always want to share some thoughts with you. It's from reddit so you may saw them before. I agree with them and I find it's funny. I mean funny how things have progressed. Years ago people used to say something like "it's so hard to use this bitcoin, nobody takes it!". And what's now? Now people persuaded that "it's so hard to use this fiat, all the banks are closed and I can't deposit this money order til they open because apparently Walmart doesn't cash out USPS money orders and blah blah blah".

i dont think that this will happen in the next 30-40 years. instead they will go side by side for a long time.

Sure ,there are tons of guys engage in bitcoin indurstry in China, it seems nothing can stop them

We could just address btc in terms of µbtc or millibtc
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:09:07
Of course it will be Bitcoin because cryptocurrency is the future.

I don't think many people would be "chipping in" to a donation address. 
The only way this could potentially be successful would be if the ad revenue would be enough to support the payouts. This would make it so playing the game would be similarly profitable to that of faucets. The fact that a game payout for getting a high score would likely alone not add to the popularity of the game.
