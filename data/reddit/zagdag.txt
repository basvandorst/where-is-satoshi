We want to add this training to our regular catalog. Andreas has recently stressed the open source nature of his book and encouraged everybody to use it in whatever way that promotes bitcoin. I'm sure other training providers will also start offering this and therefore more trainers will be needed.

It Is. Japanese banks were not allowed to invest outside the banking sector, cutting them off from fintech investments (like Goldman Sachs invested in Circle, BBVA Bank in Coinbase etc.). That will be fixed.
At the same time they will recognize bitcoin as money, going against the trend of western governments treating it as some freaky new asset class. Doing this means bitcoin will simply be regulated as money, unlike the US where it is boxed in by every regulator the country has, crippling its growth. When Japan hosts the G7 in early June this will be one of the main topics.
So the future of bitcoin in Japan looks like this (I'm summarizing but this is based on facts - do your research): Banks will invest in bitcoin exchanges giving them one foot in the old money world and another in the world of bitcoin. They will then be OK with money flowing to bitcoin. Having one of the highest government debts in the world, an ageing population and unstoppable deflation, Japan's government has realized that bitcoin is a possible life raft. And they are about to explain this to the G7. That's the meaning of this. Huge!

Bitcoin removes friction from the economy. Payments become email-like. Billing happens in real time and eventually metering becomes synonymous with billing. The velocity of money goes up by orders of magnitude. That, and the programmable nature of bitcoin transactions increases productivity which is the engine of growth in an economy.
And of course the gold-like qualities of bitcoin: protect your population from the impending QE doom. I guess everybody here knows that argument.

I understand that but we want to bring it as a classroom training. We can reach a large base of former training customers who may pick this up as an entry into the world of bitcoin.

Nothing like a deep governance crisis to fix bitcoin's governance issues.. I'm happy we're taking this hurdle now.

How about saving first and spending later. Revolutionary?!

Yes this a direct threat: evolve (centralize so we can our hands on it) or (we'll make you) die.

Dreadful loss of value.. If loss of value occurs then hodlers won't hodl much longer. Silbert said it clearly: first is speculation which builds critical mass, then comes adoption. That's how the flywheel works. Chase away the hodlers and everything comes apart. We all saw the IMF paper: they will regulate VC and not just the exchanges but even the wallets or any other players. This is on the path to the moon. Negate this and bitcoin will become a tiny little altcoin the size of Dash. My money is on moving with the stream.

It won't happen. It's tempting to think of Coinbase as a bank for digital currencies but they're not. Coinbase is a security company. They don't compete with banks but with the likes of Trezor. Bankers have evolved to become money wizzards instead of vault keepers.

They bought Hyperledger. Building a permissioned, tokenless intrabank network. No bitcoin at all at Digital Asset Holdings.

What do you think happens when the network is out of capacity? Will everybody just wait it out? Or run for the doors? This would be so funny if I had no skin in the game.

You can sell them to me. I want to get my ripple account funded, need at least 100 ripples. I'll pay you back in BTC. rHjvEfMqeJZSPbHkVXfNkXDvKWs6WKFTiQ

USD 70 billion by 11 million coins = USD 6,300 for one coin. That's one scenario.

Can bitcoin end up as the one global currency? It is one scenario out of millions. There are so many gates along the way, but it is possible. My point is: ALL scenarios are equally plausible. You should base your investment decision on a detached calculation, not just on a belief.

This is soo good. It reminds me of trying to understand the internet 25 years ago. You should seriously consider authoring the black and yellow idiot's guide to bitcoin!
