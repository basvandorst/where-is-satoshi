Alright makes sense, do you know a wallet and program to get me started?
Also, I might sound retarded when I ask this, but what do you mean by ASIC?

What about a wallet?
And I'm assuming I'll be "selling" my processing power correct?

How so?

Thank you friend.

No signup fee? Just an additional doc?
This would still work with my app right, as a wallet to check my prices? But for trading, buying &amp; selling use the website.

What is FIAT? (Sorry if that’s a stupid question)
Also the rates they tax you at on pro is in ridiculously lower. It’s like 1/16th of how much they do on the application. Thank you.

Security good?

Thank you. I seriously appreciate it.

I already own some bitcoin, I’m just looking for a better place which I believe I found (Coinbase Pro).
More security and less fees, more in depth.
But to answer your questions.
United States,
No more than 1000 at once, right now I’m a small time roller.
Anything from my personal bank, PayPal &amp; Debit.
Proceeds aren’t important if we’re investing for a long haul.
Privacy is important in a sense, anonymity is key. But all transactions are on the blockchain anyways.

Take your word for it.

Is that an in app upgrade? Or separate application entirely?
