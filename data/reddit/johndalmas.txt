I'm not sure that make sense; I think the point of verifying a transaction is to confirm it is well formed BEFORE signing it. 
Besides, if I create an unsigned transaction in coinbin, it verifies fine.  It only fails to verify when I create it in Electrum

that's a private key, not an address

Thanks!  Sounds like you found the answer, or at least a big part of it.  But would this explain why these keys are associated with different legacy addresses, but the same segwit address?

damn.  I'm also posting this in r/electrum in case they can help

Thanks!  That is interesting; I did not notice the extra "/0" that electrum left out.  I will try to modify the path accordingly.
As for omni, I don't know.  That's what started this whole problem for me.  I have some MAID tokens stuck in a segwit address; omni does not appear to support segwit, so I've been trying to cobble together a transaction manually that spends my tokens to a legacy address.  My attempts kept failing, and, in the course of that happening, I noticed this, and wondered if it was part of the problem.

The private keys start with "L" in both cases (Bip39 tool and electrum)

I believe so.  I can double check, but for now I can say that the address and public key are the same in the BIP39 decoder as they are in electrum; that should mean the derivation paths are the same, right?

thanks for the reply!  So, am I correct in thinking that if the server were somehow to become malicious and actively try to retain records, it would still not be possible to do so, as long as the software (wasabi wallet) on the user end was functioning properly?
