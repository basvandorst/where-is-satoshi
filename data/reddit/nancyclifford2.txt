So, as far as I understand, in order to receive Bitcoins I have to use a service like Coinbase or BitPay. But which one would you prefer? It seems like Coinbase is getting a bit coporate? 
If you want to hodl bitcoin and not convert to fiat, then you can use a free decentralized processor platform like mycelium gears.


Let's say I have to pay some of my forum members. (for their contributions etc.) With PayPal, I used their SendMoney API, which meaned that they could just press a button and receive the funds in their PayPal instantly. Is there any similar thing with Bitcoins?
Your members would supply you with a bitcoin address that you could then fund as needed.


If I send/receive a Bitcoin payment will people be able to see my personal name / information? Or will they be able to "look me up"
The mycelium gears platform would sufficiently protect your financial posture. Additional resources like joinmarket could be used to enhance your privacy.


A bit linked to my previous question: Is it possible to just link a business name to my payments whenever I send Bitcoins?
There is a payments protocol specification that supports this.

I didn't look at the video because of the stigma of *coin conjuring up images of an altcoin. Because of that, I have no idea what you are doing and little interest to try and find out more.

Nothing TPTB can do can stop the original properties of bitcoin from being a thing.
Bitcoin is digital gold. Just as real gold cant be used to buy anything in the world, it will be ok if bitcoin can't be used either (because it has been coopted/forked into some bastard/distopian shit govcoin etc).
Bitcoin works just fine as a black market currency and still has plenty of value, utility, and potential as such.

Fiat money can, and should, be backed by gold/silver. Fiats might start off like that, but the incentive to print more than what it is backed by is always too great and starts the inevitable demise of the system.
"Backing" is done by a legal definition that gives equal value between a specific weight in gold/silver and a specific denominated note. For example, a dollar would/was defined as 27 grams of pure silver (something like that). A banking system would be legally obligated to exchange a dollar note for that weight of silver and visa versa.

If we're going to make a consensus complicated change, we should do it while bitcoin is only a $3mmm market.
I like the idea of making it variable based on previous performance and making the adjustments 25% up/down at large intervals like 25k-100k block (quarterly/yearly). A longer interval increases the cost to a large miner trying to run up the blocksize to push other smaller miners out.

I don't believe bitcoins/satoshi are actually burned to create a colored coin - they are just tagged as such in colored coin compatible wallets. If you spend those colored coins to a noncompatible wallet, the color gets erased. IIRC anyway.

The reason this doesnt work is consensus. They might make a transaction like this and add it to their copy of the blockchain ledger, but nobody else would recognize such an entry and refuse to add it to their copy of the ledger. And nobody would adopt the code that did this for a developer. Unless you were a ripple/dogecoin idiot (or other such nonsense).

If you extend the retargeting out far enough, it will give everyone plenty of time to plan ahead for a change.
If you set the retargetting to every 100k blocks (about a year) and use a max change of, say, 20% it should be easy enough to see how the network is performing and know what is coming, with plenty of time to upgrade or whatever.
This has the benefit of making a spam attack cost more because it must be sustained for a longer period of time to influence the blocksize.
Dynamic is the way to go. Just need to iron out the right retarget algo.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:37:21
Define "work". It wont break anything. Miners can run the new code, build their blocks and get forked as a minority until they dont when a majority starts recognizing the more difficult chains.
They would really only get forked when there were more tham 1m txs to bundle. Combine that with their chance of solving the block anyway doesnt seem like it would be much of a loss to them.
