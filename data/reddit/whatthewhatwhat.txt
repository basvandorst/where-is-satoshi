Satoshi posted the white paper and then the first version of the code to the cypher punk web forum.  Not sure the actual domain name, but Hal Finney and another student were the first to get involved.  Then others downloaded the code and started to mine.  Eventually, a post was made on Slashdot and saw a new wave of enthusiast participate.

You know these are being worked on right? Why do people expect engineering efforts to be fixed overnight?  I've worked in software for over a decade and directly or indirectly for over a dozen organizations.  And one thing is always certain, engineers know the best way forward.  This isn't a sales or marketing problem.  Bitcoin is a protocol and the problems are ALL engineering related.  And there are 100's if not 1000's of passionate engineers working everyday to scale and improve Bitcoin.

What about when I buy with USD? Can my newly bought bitcoin showup in a SegWit address?

Eventually this price will peak and then come back down.  How high up and how far down nobody knows.  But as OP said, learn what is means to HODL.
Disclaimer: I bought my first coin around $900 in 2013.  Bought every dip back down to $200 for the next two years.  NEVER SOLD AT ANYTIME.  I can now pay off my house, debt and fund my kids college.  HODL, HODL, HODL.

@_date: 2014-03-28 13:56:19
Agreed.  OP probably doesn't understand this.  Wall St for instance is interested in only investment opportunities and it is my opinion that Wall St is vital in making Bitcoin successful among the masses in a short amount of time.  Sure, organic growth between businesses and consumers can happen, but I believe Wall St is so influential.  For instance, if options and futures were available for BTC, then large companies (like Amazon), could hedge against price drops which will make it easier to accept Bitcoin as a payment method.

It is market manipulation. Higher volume in a small market cap with no liquidity will have drastic moves.  Manipulation would be something like getting ahead of trades which happens in HFT on Wall St or shady stuff that happens in ForEx markets.  The Mt Gox bot (if true), was market manipulation.

How so?  There is demand.  Indian culture, used in electronics, so many uses.

Dogecoin has a limitless supply, i.e. infinite amounts can be mined.  That's worse than governments printing money

Oh no, why the drop in value of pizzas?

Sorry, that was funny as hell to read

She created credit default swaps as a tool.  Everyone else abused it whick led to the 2008 disaster.  Blythe Masters is wickedly smart and if you read the OP article you'll see she understands Bitcoin's protocol and it's potential

 &gt; 5.Chinese central bank prints new Chinese RMB out of thin air to give to Chinese company in exchange for US dollars.
Why would the Chinese print more of their own currency?

The fact that it can be corrupted is why it will stay around.  Kings, dictators, governments live off of corruption

Why I frequent r/bitcoinmarkets more than r/bitcoin

I'm sure he's busy doing more important things, but not to say TED isn't important 
@_date: 2016-05-06 01:12:38
Exactly.  Things are pretty obvious here.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:28:43
I see.  Yeah, he might have been conned

They don't lose or gain anything.  Instead their worth goes up or down

In a truly free market maybe.  But large banks and governments will get in the way.  Plus 2030 is only 15 years away.  No way mass adoption will happen that fast regardless 
@_date: 2015-10-17 01:15:45
But, but...what about...Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-03-29 16:21:48
Been using Namecheap for years.  Their support is awesome and Bitcoin integration is seamless.

Don't they own 1 million bitcoin?  I wouldn't exactly say they're just selling shovels.  Creating Gemini wasn't exactly an easy ROI.
@_date: 2016-05-10 01:05:57
Agree.  And hopefully those private keys were destroyed.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:22:10
Wall St.  They're really good at making money.  Let them use Bitcoin however they want. The protocol doesn't care and neither does the creator(s)

Get a fucking lawyer man.  $200K is A LOT OF MONEY

Never thought of that.  Very cool idea :)

There are still some good smaller subreddits out there.  I like r/diy r/frugal and r/woodworking to name a few.

It shouldn't be a matter of opinion.  Proof of a signature is all that is needed.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:25:29
Definitely.  HODL is not to sell when price is falling.  Nice catch on the uppercase screw up

Most of those are their coins (for crediting user's accounts when they buy) and institutional investors that they need on their Pro Exchange (formerly GDAX) to provide liquidity for their exchange.  
I interviewed at their a while back and this was explained to me.

And for the record, as long as BTC is less than $1000, then Coinbase is taking a hit to thir bottom line in the short-term.  Kudos to Coinbase!!!
P.S. Is my math correct? .01 BTC = $7.30 &lt; ($5 + $5)

I believe that is just you referring to Jimmy Whales
