If bitcoin development is taken over by those entities, we have a problem. _One_ problem, not two. At this point there is no reason to expect that.
If incompetent people like Ver and Wu takes over, _all_ the research and technologies currently in the pipeline goes down the drain, and we end up with a petty coin suitable only for online poker, at best.

I don't want to force anyone, but if a contentious hard fork forces the core team to increase the block size whenever a miner wants it, they will probably abandon the project all together.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:17:54
Well, that's really not what I am talking about.
In essence, there is at least 5 different implementations of the bitcoin consensus rules, bitcoind, libbitcoin, btcd, bcoin and gocoin.
All of them are trying to follow the same set of consensus rules. If they don't, I'm not talking about them here.
I understand that failing to implement the rules correctly is a problem, and I have already addressed that in a earlier comment.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:16:04
2x is not designed as a hard fork, it is designed as a hijacking of the current blockchain.

No, those comments has different contexts.
You misunderstood what I was talking about, and only the last one reflects that.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:19:25
Bitcoin depends on mining and network nodes being decentralized. That is no longer the case. In fact, this attack is the ultimate test. If Wu &amp; Co. can wreak havoc on our network, so can any motivated government.

I didn't say it only applied to the left. The authoritarian deplorables on the right is an even more pathetic spectacle.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:32:24
Since nodes are the ones that validate and add blocks to the blockchain, they can also censor transactions by simply refusing to add blocks.
It seems to me that in order to efficiently censor a transaction as a miner, you need 100% of the hash power, but with nodes, you only need 51% to prevent that transaction to ever be included in the chain
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:53:33
It's a good idea, but don't invest more than you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:19:54
There is no such thing as a mining node. A mining pool typically has one node, which is just another node it the network of equal nodes.
A miner only do one thing, which is to try to find a nonce value that satisfies the difficulty before all the other miners. That's it.
The problem is that Coinbase supports a contentious and dangerous hard fork causing fear and confusion, and they are doing it against their own users will. If 2x hadn't jeopardized every ones investments like this we would all have been doing fine.

I hope you are right, but even if you are, bitcoin mining and the number of full nodes are massively centralized and have to be fixed one way or another.

@_date: 2017-09-27 16:07:30


Yes it is.


If mining had not been centralized, which it was not supposed to be, this fork would not have the same potential to destroy the original bitcoin.
The NYA Round Table knows this, they know that mining has become centralized, and they want to leverage it in order to gain control of the source code without doing a hard fork.
The core team will not continue working on bitcoin if a closed meeting can succeed in taking control that way, and I don't really blame them.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:05:22


It is, but if btc1 succeeds without doing a hard fork, it could render the bitcoin project useless by effectively hijacking the blockchain. That also means that _the miner_ can continue to throw block size increases into the mix every time he wants more fees, or if he has another online poker site to foster.
That's why Maxwell said


@_date: 2017-09-27 13:30:34
According to the NYA agreement it is not supposed to do a hard fork, even though it is likely to do so eventually.
Unless I'm missing something here, Garzik, which is a believer in hard forks, is preparing a soft fork that will orphan nodes that doesn't follow hes new rules. Without replay protection this could cause a lot of problems, another round of confusion and people losing their coins all over the place.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:03:28
Nice :)
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:12:54
I don't think it is supposed to be a hard fork, it is designed to be a hijacking of the current blockchain, basically by "getting in front of it"
I believe it happens in November
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:45:15


This is what every node in the network does, and as I said, an entire mining pool only need one such node running. ASIC miners are completely unable to do any of this.
Also, I'm not loyal to anyone, I'm loyal to what makes bitcoin unique and valuable, and I know how easy it is to ruin it, and how many who would love to do just that.
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:54:40
It could take some time. If its legit, it should show up.
Did you have those coins on Mycelium before the fork?
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:39:35
If a couple of miners can force a consensus rule change on all the current developers, and all the investors that never asked for it, we have a problem. A _big_ problem. 
This is why both miners and network nodes are supposed to be decentralized. The system _depends_ on it. We have warned against this for f**** 9 years now!
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:57:55
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:41:13
It depends on a few things, like what type of coin you sent and if the wallet you are using are synced
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:26:48
There is a lot of reasons that has been discussed many times over but to sum it up in one sentence I would say: electronic gold
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:02:39
1. You risk losing your initial investment of $10, and if the value of the coins has gone up while you held them, you lose that too, obviously.
2. $10 should be fine, but be aware that there is a fee involved, so doing fewer transactions for bigger amounts might be a better idea.
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:17:31
It would make the network more resilient against forced changes, giving users the ability to choose which software to trust.
It also provides users with a fallback in case the project are compromised in any way.
Competition is generally a healthy thing, and impossible to prevent, so why even try?
Working together has been the norm for years. I see no reason not to continue with that.
For example, from what I have heard, the Lightning developers have been using btcd as a backend.
The dangers of centralized development has been known and discussed since the early days, it's not exactly a new thing. I would say that if implementing a relatively simple set of rules is considered too hard, or too dangerous, we have bigger problems than competing implementations to worry about.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:51:57


It's one type of "compromise", a word I have mentioned several times.
I would agree that the crypto in particular would benefit more from multiple independent reviews than multiple implementations, but I still think the set of consensus rules should be properly examined, documented and understood for everyone's benefit.
Also, as you are saying yourself, openssl can be a security risk, so imagine if that was the only implementation we had available.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:54:56
That's just the beginning of the sentence. The rest of it basically implies that Bitcoin was just a toy. The "real" thing has to be built by serious and trustworthy sources like himself and hes beloved Microsoft.
Btw, the picture is also out of context.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:19:46


I'm pretty sure this is also about how reorg works. The white paper doesn't take alt coins (different consensus rules) into account.
As long as both core and 2x nodes receives blocks smaller than 1MB, no fork will happen, but once a &gt;1MB block shows up, there will be a permanent fork, unless the 2X nodes reorgs back to 1X, which _could_ happen since they are compatible with 1X's blocks.


We have seen an example of this with bitcoin cash. The moment a fork happens, there is no longer a competition. From then on people gets to choose which coin they want to stick with. Long confirmation times will be temporary, and not a big deal for most users.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:22:43
It would be more helpful if we run a miner in addition to a 0.15 node.
Everyone who has a old miner lying around should turn them back on. The faster we can adjust the difficulty after a fork, the better.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:58:30
That's true. One hardware wallet should be good enough though, if used safely
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:39:05
In that regard it is not a problem. When it comes to insisting on using the name "Bitcoin", it becomes somewhat of a problem
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:37:49


Sure, but if more than 50% of the other nodes are rejecting a block that you accept, you will be on a fork on your own.
For a transaction to be included in a block, one miner accepting the transaction winning the race is enough. Even if that miner only represents 5% of the hashing power it will happen eventually.

If you decide to do this, I would suggest installing Electrum.
It will make you create an account when you run it for the first time, and you will be asked to write down the seed for the account. You should write down the seed with a pen and paper. That paper essentially becomes your paper wallet.
You should also opt in to use an encryption password when asked for it, and type that password down on the same paper.
And of course, keep that paper safe from prying eyes! You can write the seed and password to a file instead of a paper, but in general, that would be less safe from hacking.
If that is successful, you can go to the receive tab in Electrum to get a receive address, then you go to Coinbase and withdraw your coins to that address.

Simply speaking, the consensus rules are governed by the majority of the nodes and miners in the network. As long as a majority of the nodes and miners agree on the same rules, they will produce the longest blockchain (most cumulative difficulty), and the longest blockchain is the one we all trust and use as a lookup reference.
So, having a healthy and decentralized network of nodes and miners is essential for security.

And the Bitcoin white paper
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:10:54


If he finds a valid block before everyone else, and that block contains the transaction, the nodes will add it to the top of the chain, right?
I mean, the other miners, who doesn't accept that transaction, doesn't really have a say in that scenario.

@_date: 2017-09-12 19:14:10
That assumes governments will forever be unable to control the majority of nodes in the network. When it comes to censorship, miners means nothing, the majority of nodes is everything.
This is important to remember in a time when a block size debate is being used to blind you from the truth.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:10:02
The relevant industry should show more interested in this, and contribute resources for it.
I'm not criticizing anyone for not doing this, but I think something like this is important enough to have it's own BIP like procedure.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:33:04
Um, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:09:26


Yeah. It should survive, but removing or adding 90% hashing power quickly causes a lot of problems because the difficulty takes quite some time to adjust. But we should be able to wait it out though.
The best defense imo would be a proof of work algorithm that works best on consumer grade equipment, like CPU/GPU and that also has a memory requirement.
It would also be a good idea to give full nodes an economic incentive, since we need many of them to stay secure. I actually think the Lightning network fixes that to some extent.

You are mistaking Maxwell for Wu and Ver.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:24:56

I'm not too worried about 2x. I'm worried that incompetent morons will find a way to take control of the code just so miner(s) can continue to abuse bitcoin fees and Ver &amp; Co. can have their petty online poker site.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:57:09
There is a million ways a software project can be compromised. I'm not talking about different consensus rules. Having multiple bitcoin clients makes it a less viable attack to try to compromise any given project in the first place.
Comparing it to operating systems, the fact that Windows has been allowed to monopolize the entire field is now a security and privacy nightmare it will take years, if not decades, to get out of.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:35:16
I just said that if a fork happens, it would be an advantage to have as much hashing power as possible on the 1x chain if we want it to survive.
If not, 2x has basically proven that bitcoin consensus rules can be overridden when mining becomes too centralized.
That said, I don't really care anymore. Mining has to be viable on consumer grade products for bitcoin to have a chance to stay decentralized.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:12:16
I don't think you should come out too hard on people here. I wouldn't worry at all for the long term, as long as I can survive loosing it all.
Besides, I wouldn't be surprised if this dip is partially caused by Chinese exchanges off-loading some of their liquidity. Those coins will likely end up in the hands of someone with a different mindset.
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:26:07
Bitcoin Core is a full node. It does require you to stay in sync with the blockchain and the network. 
If you want something simpler I would recommend Electrum

If users don't control the protocol, how the heck is 2x going to succeed?

This whole discussion is actually quite ridiculous. Microsoft has provided NSA the tools and training to access Windows for decades. There is plenty of information about this for anyone who cares to look for it.
People keep defending Windows not because it is secure, but because they _want_ it to be.
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:07:48


Since 2X doesn't have replay protection, I would avoid doing any transactions after the fork, until things have settled down.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:38:04


You should do it that way, even if other configurations might work as well.
Note that the .service file expects bitcoind to run as the bitcoin user/group.
It's also a good idea to run bitcoind directly from the command line first. (You should be able to stop it with Ctrl-c, or killall bitcoind) That way you will see any error messages coming from bitcoind itself if there is anything wrong with the config. Once it seems to start and run without problems you can enable it at startup with the systemctl commands.


Did you copy the bitcoind.service file to the "/lib/systemd/system" directory, as randomangryperson said?

In one way or another, it will :)

@_date: 2017-09-12 00:28:37


You can't really argument against that.
Unfortunately, having only one implementation has it's own drawbacks and isn't  really an option. That's why it's so important to have the best possible relationship and communication between developers across different projects.
If a project gets hijacked, or for some reason has a backdoor, the ability to quickly move to another implementation is very important.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:59:46
This is only true if you put huge blinders on.
If you look at _all_ the things core has said, and the technology they propose to get us into the future, this petty argument doesn't make any sense anymore.
People have to wake up from their Roger Ver fascination. He doesn't give a shit about other peoples investments, or their hopes for the future for that matter, and the fact that he has invested in all the top 20 coins proves it. He is willing to destroy Bitcoin just to get hes way, which isn't even based on sound research.
According to Ver, bitcoin will become a store of value as a _result_ of mass adoption. So, who is going to buy a coin that doesn't even qualify as a store of value in the first place?
It's time to wake up.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:59:46

I'm not so sure. In a way it is already the perfect currency. A unit of exchange you actually want to hold on to until you really need or want to spend it. In the mean time we can spend some of those alt coins just to keep the wheels going

Ubuntu has moved from upstart to systemd, and I don't think the bitcoin documentation hasn't been updated to reflect that.
You should probably follow the systemd instructions here:
except that on ubuntu, the location for .service files are _/lib/systemd/system_ instead of _/usr/lib/systemd/system_

bitcoind is started with this parameter -conf=/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

    rpcpassword=some_password

@_date: 2017-10-09 13:51:34
I'm not all that familiar with the Ubuntu/Debian init process (seems like a messy mix of systemd and upstart), but that error message comes from systemd.
You should try to do the stuff under "systemd" on the doc page first, and try again (remember to create the "bitcoin" user and group)
If "service bitcoind start" doesn't work, you may also try the systemd way:
    $ sudo systemctl enable bitcoind
    $ sudo systemctl start bitcoind

Create a wallet from your old seed, then transfer the funds to yet another wallet you have created with a brand new seed.

There will be a difficulty adjustment, but you have to remember that when hash power disappears, mining becomes more profitable for those who stay, so there is an opportunity for other miners to step in.


There will be miners, and I'm guessing that 2X will be the chain with fewer transactions, but I may be wrong about that. In either case, both chains will probably survive.

Didn't you just say that the community decides?
Obviously we cant have 2 chains using the same name, which is why I say it is somewhat of a problem.
I think it is naive to think that S2X is not an attempt to take control of the development away from core. 
If it wasn't, they would have proposed it on the Bitcoin mailinglist, or done the necessary research to convince the majority of the community.
I think Hearn tried to do that for a while, but when that failed they decided to attack instead of accepting that they didn't have consensus in the community.

He is emulating a blockchain fork just to test the process, but yeah, that seems to be the process of splitting the coins.

Miners doesn't have any power over the consensus rules, only the network nodes does. It is the nodes that decide what enters the blockchain, the nodes verify every transaction before relaying them to the miners, and they verify every block coming back from the miners before relaying them and adding them to the blockchain.
There is nothing a coalition of miners can do by them self other than removing their hashing power from the rules that everyone uses and spend it on something else.
The problem with a coalition of 51% miners has to do with double spending, even though it would probably take more that 51%. Double spending doesn't increase the total amount of coins though, it just triggers a reorg, basically changing recent history by creating an alternative history that has more accumulative difficulty behind it.
This is also why people are advised to wait for 3 to 6 confirmations. For each confirmation it gets exponentially harder to trigger such an alternative history.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:35:23

I can't see how exactly we are going to avoid a huge mess if Coinbase and ShapeShift starts sending peoples coins to 2x addresses after an inevitable fork. And do they even have a choice, if that chain has 90% mining behind it?
What if everyone stops doing transactions for a long period of time?
I can't see how a lot of unknowing people are not going to end up on the wrong chain, or the chain they later on realize they shouldn't have been on.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:07:52
Basically, the blockchain contains coins that are cryptographically associated with your private key.
When the Bitcoin blockchain is forked, all the coins in the chain are copied, but the copies are still associated with the same private keys(!)
That's how you automagically end up with more coins, without really doing anything.
That said, in order to be in control of your coins, you have to actually hold the private key yourself. I'm not sure about Blockchain.info, but I believe they allow you to retrieve the private key for your wallet, allowing you to take complete control if you so wish.
That is not the case for Coinbase. As a custodian, Coinbase holds the private key on your behalf, and they won't hand out the keys, so when it comes to manipulating the new 2x coins, you depend on them to make them available to you.

I don't know why we would need a EDA.
The way I understand it, as soon as a &gt;1MB block shows up, the 2X miners will never ever generate a valid core block ever again. It's impossible.
At that point core miners are the only ones generating blocks that will be accepted by the core nodes.

The whitepaper is talking about the longest chain _within a network that follow the same rules_. It's the description of how a node reorganize its copy of the blockchain when two competing blocks are propagated through the network at the same time.
This is something that happens regularly, even in a network where all the nodes are following the same rules.
A block size increase will, if I'm not mistaken, fork permanently and leave behind two separate networks that doesn't accept each others blocks. That's not the same situation.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:07:47


That's not what I am trying to say. What I am saying is that the _majority_ of nodes decides what the longest valid chain is, and if one of those nodes has a miner running in the background doesn't make it more or less influential in deciding what a valid chain is.
And the longest valid chain is by definition Bitcoin.


If nobody wants to use it, why are the 2x guys creating it in the first place by doing a hard fork?
We already have bigger blocks, small backlog, lower fees and a road map that can actually scale, not just bump the block size once...

I would say the benefit of having multiple implementations far out weights the disadvantages. Having only one implementation has serious implications if that project is compromised in any way, and there is no alternatives to switch to.

That's not an alternative implementation. It's an alternative coin, or a fork.

Unfortunately, when mining gets centralized, the markets starts following the miner instead of the miners following the markets.
This is definitely not what Satoshi wanted.
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:28:28


It isn't, and it never was. You haven't said anything that proves that. The only thing you have said that makes sense is that mining has become so centralized (which it was not supposed to be, see the CryptoNode whitepaper) that it could potentially destroy the investors trust in the technology.
If you read the Bitcoin whitepaper, you will realize that Satoshi didn't even differentiate between miners and nodes. At that time nobody had heard of ASIC's, so if anyone has been going out of their way to destroy hes invention, it is the ASIC miners. Mining was supposed to be decentralized, not because it sounds nice, but because it is a requirement for Bitcoin to stay resistant against censorship and government takeover. Without that, it is worthless as a store of value, as history has shown.
The truth is that the users and investors of the technology decides if it is useful or not, regardless of what the name of the project is. 
If the changes 2X is doing was actually valuable to people, there would be no need to hijack the Bitcoin name, would it?

It's also worth mentioning that mining will become more profitable with fewer miners around. Even if the difficulty will put a damper on that for a while, I wouldn't be surprised if mining picks up in an exponential fashion.
It's also worth mentioning that miners who support BTC could possibly benefit from mining something else from now on, and go back to mining BTC after the fork has happened. I haven't done the math on that, but sacrificing some profit now could pay back in terms of lower difficulty after the fork.

I don't think the software for doing this is ready at this point, but the procedure is simple: 
Install a wallet that only handles Bitcoin Gold (when it comes out) and import your regular bitcoin private key there.
When you open the Bitcoin Gold wallet it should show the exact same amount of Bitcoin Gold as you had in Bitcoin when the fork happened.
You don't have to transfer anything, just import the private key.
That said, you should be careful about this and probably wait for someone to write a guide first.

Look, I'm not here to fool anyone. How bitcoin works is well understood. Miners can't change the consensus rules that all the network nodes follow. All they can do is to fork the node software, change it, and hope that people will use it over the original.
Even if they did that (they already have) it would just create another fork of the blockchain, which has happened many times before.
Miners can't dictate what software people are running on all the network nodes, and the nodes are the ones doing the verification of all transactions, blocks and the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:06:53
This could become an issue


The ideal situation would be to put those decisions in the hands of the (stake)holders, after a process where developers and researchers have analyzed the pros and cons of each proposal in a strict non-political way.
For a evenly distributed coin this _could_ work out in a fair way, given that many small holders would be able to out-vote a few big holders if it was important enough for them to do so.
It's also important to remember that with the ability to move funds across chains (atomic swap, ShapeShift), having multiple competing coins does make more sense, as long as those coins have their own separate chain. People would basically vote with their feet by moving their assets to their favorite chain.
It would make a lot more sense to me if the 2x fork made it clear that it would fork the chain from day one. And it wouldn't hurt if the miners were willing to move their hashing power over gradually. That's the least I would expect from a responsible individual actually.

MyCelium stores the private keys locally on your device, so you decide how to handle things after the fork, which is generally a good thing.
You should be careful though, especially since 2X doesn't implement replay protection.
Bascially, 
Make sure you have the backup seed for the MyCelium wallet, and keep it safe and secure.
Avoid doing transactions after the fork, at least until things settle down.
Coins on the exchanges are under their control. If you get access to the forked coins, and when, is up to them. Personally I would transfer the coins to a wallet on my own PC/Mobile before the fork.

They won't go nuclear. US needs NK to instill fear in their own population so they can continue to drive up military spending.
Just look at the ridiculously weak arguments for why China doesn't want the NK horror show to stop.

Version 2.9 introduced SegWit and a lot of other stuff, I actually had some issues with it myself. You could try version 2.8 just to see if that helps

They would be mining a fork with low activity and probably a low coin value.


The problem is that if the most active nodes like Coinbase and ShapeShift are running 2x rules, a lot of the transactions would be 2x, and the users doing the transactions may not even be aware what is going on. 
And if that happens, the core team could drop continuing bitcoin development as a result.

Yeah, I didn't really mean it like that. Just make sure you both find a secure hiding place for the keys :)

There are many Android bitcoin wallets. Is it Electrum, MyCelium?
