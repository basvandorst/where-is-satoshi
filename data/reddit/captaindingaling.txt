Everyone was calling it tulip mania then too. There was one exchange, very few wallets and every economist who was ever interviewed said it was a scam. The people who bought and held deserve everything they get.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:12:21
How quaint and it can also apply if you bought at 10k and sold for 10,001 but there's also opportunity cost and I've seen enough regretful "what if" posts on this sub to know better than quaintness.

My conspiracy theory is the reason Satoshis coins never moved is because the NSA/FBI special team has ownership of them.
@_date: 2019-07-03 12:03:21
If think doing they won't catch you by doing that you're an idiot. If they see multiple payments just below the maximum amount they will still get you.
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:00:40
You sound like someone whose never owned a passport.

If they knew the writing was on the wall, the devil you know if better than the devil you don't. They may have been secretly buying up cheap coins since the start, if the financial endgame is debt clearance through hyper inflation of the us dollar.
@_date: 2019-07-15 09:48:55
The fact that there's 2000 means the market is not rational, even if most of them have small volumes. It ALWAYS goes back to the coin fundamentals and developer commits. There's room for about 5 different coins for different applications (imho only 3 currently are worth anything of utility), everything else is toxic.
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:03:15

Anyone willing to guess how many Reddit hard drives are filled with solely this comment?

It didn't reference anywhere that he had any intention of destroying anything.
@_date: 2019-11-10 09:54:00
He has a vanity address, chances are strong that he he knows what he's doing, believes in bitcoin and still has them.

Mate, after traveling through most of the world and seeing what's on offer I would never want to live in America. Your food, healthcare, education and social cohesion is fucked. Get out if you can. Americans assume they have a great standard of living, when the reality is not the case compared to a lot of the first world.

If you want to be an IT desk monkey all your life go for it, but you can't get a proper job in a big tech firm without one. I know because I have a degree and worked in one until I retired.
@_date: 2019-08-09 08:43:39
That's bullshit. You need a degree for STEM jobs, with coincidentally is the only degree worth considering.

@_date: 2019-08-31 12:34:32
You're all over the place, try and be coherent. My point stands that a Google employee stealing keys is a far bigger problem than a single app doing this.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:45:53
*laughs in Irish*
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:52:39
The reason why:
1. You express the same opinion as the common man that watches your show and treat it with a similar distain that they have.
2. Over the course of a few months you begin to be "convinced" by your guests of the merits of bitcoin, at the same time bringing your viewers along for the ride.
3. No one realise you've already stacked bags.
4. Blast out to everyone how great bitcoin is and start the pump.
5. Profit.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:48:13
Hypothetically, if you are a citizen of another European country and have some bitcoin to cash out, how do you practically go about doing it without paying capital gains in your own country? How long do you have to be there and what steps do you have to go through?
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:40:51
Na, it's not resilient until it's worth over a trillion.
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:57:19
I honestly don't understand this. The principle is simple, buy and hold and after a long enough time frame you are wealthier. It's fucking elementary.
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:23:48
Sorry no. You have to call into question someone who willingly gave a lot of money who sent her "pictures".

Picture the scene, you're leaving a Starbucks and someone puts a gun to your back and tells you to get into a van parked on a street. They blindfold you and drive you to a warehouse. Over the course of several hours they remove your fingernails and possibly kneecaps trying to extract where your private keys are, even if you have none. The fear of this alone would ever prevent me doing something like this. All because you wanted to look flashy to strangers while driving down the road. You can have someone killed for 10k.

@_date: 2019-08-27 07:12:39
Op said *quietly* buying. 
You can have someone killed for 10k. Imagine being pulled out of your bed at night and thrown in a van. Your kneecaps, fingernails and teeth are slowly removed. How long will it take until you hand over your private keys? If BTC hits 300k you can be sure that unscrupulous people will be combing the internet for free money. Pride comes before a fall.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:17:23
Bitcoin is a liquid asset unlike many others. You can't throw someone in a van and get them to sign over the deeds to investment property, but you can with bitcoin. There's a very big difference.
@_date: 2019-10-09 00:02:45
Peters amount of hair is inversely proportional to the price of bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-10-04 06:09:41
Why do people insist on making a target of themselves? The less that people know you own bitcoins the better.
@_date: 2019-08-31 12:30:46
Don't be stupid. The logical conclusion of your arguement ends with you coding your entire custom smartphone OS.

You probably don't understand the finer points of how BGP makes global routing possible, yet here you are, on the internet.
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:26:59
It happens to rich people too. Bitcoin is peer to peer and practically untraceable which makes it more of a target. My point is why open yourself to this risk for the case of stoking your ego.
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:36:44
It happens.

Some Google employee shifting sequences of twelve words into a seed decoder for their own gain is a far bigger problem here.

I'm literally a bitcoin multi millionaire. I'm giving you advice. People with 50k of bitcoin in a could of years could have 500k on their hands and if they run their mouths about bitcoins now they run the risk of certain people remembering.
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:48:57
Exactly. Op should stop confusing the matter needlessly
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:21:20
Well said mate. I think a lot of people you're replying to are guys with less than 10 coins in holdings though.

First step is clone the drive for something like this.

In a bull run you can excuse the exchanges for being a bit laggy when it comes to deposits. 25k is small fry and they probably focus more on bigger traders.

This is one of the best comments I've seen on Reddit in a long time.
It goes the same for- going to the gym all those times you should have, talking to that girl you really liked, reading that book you really should have and as meaningless as "picking last week's lottery number".
The real question is- you've watched the rise and rise of bitcoin over the past nine years, are you really going to sit there as a no-coiner for the next nine and still complain to us again in the same way?
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:06:13
That was 150 years ago. Society has moved on.

Trolls on this sub make me think there's an effort to depress prices before a big buy. It seems to happen periodically.

You were smart enough to figure out that swings are a bad thing but not smart enough to realise what it will mean for everyone who owns bitcoin when it won't be volatile.

Unless you're prepping the food for long term storage in your own crypto chateaux.
