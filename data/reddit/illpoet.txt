ok first you want to get a wallet from bitcoin.org or what i prefer, print out a paper wallet (if you are going for long term this is the safest).  Then you transfer your bitcoin from coinbase to the paper wallet.  If it goes sky high and you want to sell, you can use an android wallet (or any wallet really, just easiest with the android wallet in my experience)  to get the btc off the paper wallet then transfer it back to coinbase where you sell it.
as a long time bitcoiner I can't stress enough how important it is to NOT keep your bitcoins on an exchange like coinbase.  You absolutely want control of the private keys to your bitcoin and on an exchange that control is in the hands of someone else.  So many of my friends have lost serious amounts of money due to keeping their bitcoin on exchanges.

yeah it started out as a typo in btc-e chatroom known as "the trollbox" around 2012 or so.  When ltc was crashing a long time ago someone spammed the troll box with the word "HODL" and it caught on.

no, as far as I am aware you only have to pay taxes on the profit you made from selling bitcoin.  If you spend it on something without USD entering into the equation the sales tax should be factored into it.  I could be wrong though since I looked all this up in 2013 when the irs itself didn't have a clear plan on how to tax bitcoin.

yeah although i've never tested it with a big ticket purchase, like a car or a house, just computer stuff and what not.  so i'm not sure how it would be treated if you were buying something worth more than like 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:09:26
did you keep a record of how much you spent buying bitcoin vs how much you made selling bitcoin?  If so subtract the money you spent from the money you made and pay capital gains on the difference.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:07:56
can you prove that you lost it gambling ie receipts/emails/screencaptures?  You can use gambling losses to offset your gains, but only if you won a shitload of money gambling. you might be able to make a case that investing in bitcoin is gambling, but i'm not sure where that will get you.
Your friends case is a little trickier.  I'm not sure if you want to admit that you were making a straw purchase of bitcoin to the government.  was it a ton of money?  if it is only small amounts i wouldn't worry too much.

i'm not sure if this answers your question but when i cashed a large (for me) amount of crypto from mining in 2013 I turned in all of the receipts i had for mining related gear plus all my mtgox transactions.  I subtracted the costs of the mining gear from the mtgox and paid capital gains on the difference.

that's tough for me to say i never mined for a company i was connected to a pool and they just sent me btc or litecoin depending on the thresholds i sent.  I'd be wary of any mining operation that offered to pay me in fiat currency.   
also, even with bitcoin prices what they are it's still probably more cost efffective to just buy some and hold on to it rather than spend money on mining gear/mining groups.

i think alot of the doge hate/hate in general in bitcoin is because they feel threatened by alts, doge esp bc we are fun, friendly and CHEAP.  its not right tho.  I came to doge as an old school bitcoiner/litecoiner and as i see it doge only strengthens btc/ltc bc doge btc ltc are all interchangable and a big part of doge's value comes from that it can be traded quickly/easily to btc or ltc.  anyway lets just all have cake and forget about it for awhile.

lol its destined to find a block.

I remember the first time china banned bitcoin.  I was really scared they were going to arrest coblee's brother.  I'm actually surprised we didn't see more nations ban btc back then, as it represents a currency not easily controlled by government.

i remember the first week i got into bitcoin in 2012. they were dirt cheap and the day after i bought some there was an article in wired "the rise and fall of bitcoin" talking about how it was a good experiment that failed.
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:35:56
ok was just wondering since it seemed like they were doing ok i thought maybe they compensated everyone.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:24:28
lol awesome, thats where i got them, although i think it was 30,000
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:42:45
so funny a guy at work was always trashing btc to me until wsj started writing about it. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 09:13:40
from what i gather in the article its the people from ripple convincing an exchange to freeze ripples on an exchange?  in theory you could do that with any cryptocurrency, although ripple isn't a cryptocurrency.  I keep forgetting to sell the ripples i got for free a long time ago. i wonder if they worth anything.
@_date: 2015-11-03 08:30:26
sucks i've written them off, it burns me to see them still running an exchange when they are insanely untrustworthy.  
@_date: 2015-10-07 17:38:13
yeah i've pretty much written them off at this point.  They are like a gambler who won't pay his debts, because he's getting action again he's never going to pay down his old debts.

i play at either sealswithclubs.eu for btc or pokershibes.com for dogecoin. I've tried betcoin.ag a few times bc the also accept litecoin but it has a long late reg that annoys me.  
for the stream i use pokershibes, bc i often have non crypto guests and its easy to give someone 20k dogecoin to play with and it seems like you are playing for big money, even if its only a few dollars. heres my reference link :P 
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:15:00
well thats possible but i feel like mostly its ppl who heard about bitcoin, decided it was a scam without researching, and now that its low are prematurely saying "i told you so"
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:18:25
yeah thats a better way of putting it. And from a layman's perspective it does look like a fad/scam etc because to really understand its power you have to understand the blockchain and cryptography.  
Still, its a testament to its power that even after everything its been through it isn't even close to dying.
@_date: 2015-02-12 11:46:40
wow so many trolls. i really think all these "bitcoin is dead" are funny.  how many times has that been said and it keeps coming back?  I've lost track.
  
Its the biggest thing i deal with on my poker stream "omg you are playing poker with fake monies?" this by people who can't play for usd at all due to prohibition.  
anyway i gave them a like, but decided not to get involved with the trolls.
