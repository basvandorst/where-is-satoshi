But they're infinitely divisible...same thing.
@_date: 2019-07-16 04:54:31
Effectively the same thing

Not to mention that if subway did accept bitcoin, that sandwich now costs $3 extra in fees and you have to wait 20 minutes to confirm.  Even worse if the market decided to go rollercoaster again.  Fuck that.

No, you need to do your research.  After 21m bitcoin are created, miners will still be running to generate profits from transaction fees. Lot's of articles on this.
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:00:45
Agreed. This is cringe as fuck.

Still wrong. Bitcoin are infinitely divisible.  Even if all 21 bitcoins are minted, all it takes is a software patch to make it divisible to 16 decimals instead of 8 decimals, and you just doubled the number of satoshis available.  Per foundational economic concepts this is actually very similar to how the fed adjusts the money supply with interest rates to target a healthy ~3% inflation level.

You are wrong, zero or negative inflation (deflation) encourages hoarding and discourages spending which stifles economic growth and investment.
Hence 99.9% of bitcoin users are just holding it to speculate and not using into in the economy

And the price continues to go down.
More proof that 99% of bitcoin users are only using it to speculate.  Otherwise price would go up with software improvements.

Only 22 comments in the daily, and half of them are shitposts to upvote the daily....bitcoin interest is definitely stalling lately.

This post is cringe as hell.  I'm a millennial and my real estate portfolio averages 40% cash on cash returns every year (10% cap).  Bitcoin has never sustained that, buy low and sell high only moves the money to early adaptors from later adapters.  No actual generation of wealth.

I spent 48 hours straight trying to figure out my wallet password and wondering why it wasn't working when I swear I remembered it.  Contents were worth~ $400k.  Turns out when I created the wallet, it never had me set a password, and leaving the box blank worked :|
Thanks NanoVault.

How many billions in bitcoin have been stolen by hackers?
