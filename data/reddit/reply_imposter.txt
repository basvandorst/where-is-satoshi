It's not simply a "charity", they also accept applications for funds and they only give funds to those with projects they feel are promising. This makes me happier since they aren't just handing money out left and right. You can also apply to be a part of their charity selection board and help select organizations by emailing submit
Have you submitted an idea or organization you would like to see funded? For problems like this it seems the best course is to help rather than complain.
