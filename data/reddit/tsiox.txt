You are the first one that actually gave an answer to my question.
How long do you think it would be before the loss of coins would build up to a point where the deflation would necessitate a change to the protocol?  10 years, 100 years, 1000 years?  Never?

You wouldn't notify the system that your coins are dead.  You'd notify the system that your coins are alive.

Only trying to understand.  Historically, money has had certain properties which support it's use as an exchange of value, not as an investment.
While I don't agree with everything in [this blog post]( I would say that at least half of his argument could be eliminated if the Wallet checked every coin in on a regular basis.

Ultimately, the biggest issue would be perception.  If you talk about stamp collecting, or collecting bottle tops, or comic books, or any other slightly deflationary collectible commodity, and people will understand it right away.  Then, they'll file it mentally in the "bitcoin is just like collecting beanie babies" category.  Investing in collectibles is ok for some, but it isn't for everyone.
Honestly when talking about currency anyone who talks about instability being good for a currency, either inflationary or deflationary, it's hard to take that with a straight face.
Why would having the Wallet check in once a month to the blockchain be bad?  Seems simple.
And, after the 21 million coins are hit, instead of proof-of-work, or proof -of-stake, you could do something more reasonable and use a proof-of-participation system.  Hand out re-issued bitcoin from the expired bitcoin based on the activity of wallet.  If your wallet has checked in for each of it's bitcoin in the past month, you have the potential to be issued one of the re-issued bitcoin.  The more contiguous months in a row that your Wallet checks in, the better your chance at a re-issued bitcoin.
Having the Wallet check in seems like a simple fix to multiple issues (perceived or real) to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not infinitely divisible.  
The current protocol would need to be modified for any further subdivision.  Why would this be preferable to replacing expired bitcoin?

Demurrage has a perception problem as well.
Most people don't want to be penalized for saving money.  What I'm asking isn't about penalizing savers or spenders.
Money should be perceived as stable.

Let me say it again.  Bitcoin is very compelling.  Every other aspect of Bitcoin is extraordinary.
But, again.  Why do you believe replacing expired bitcoin is bad?

Divisability doesn't make it any less of a collectible.  It just means I own less of a collectible.

I am not suggesting replication/inflation.  I am not suggesting degrading/deflation.  I am asking why you believe replacing expired bitcoin  is bad.
