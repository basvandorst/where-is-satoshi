What's it as of now, 4501?
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:10:34
 
This says it hit 4501 at one point, may be wrong though. Not that it matters when we hit the moon

Let's say my computer explodes but I still have the password and 12 word string, can I access my BTC from another computer by downloading electrum?
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:50:52
Yes, I didn't mean there is literally nothing to be bought with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:21:59
Schiff is a smart guy but he's clearly speaking out of self interest when you take into account the fact that he owns a gold trading company lol. Gold and Bitcoin are both good. He can't be trusted to be objective on this issue.

Limited supply explains this
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:27:20
Premiums on gold are exacted at the moment of purchase and additionally with any instance of long distance exchange.

It's too late to mine BTC. You can mine ETH and LTC however

Newbie HODLer here, pretty scared because I just put a lot of my money into BTC. Will this new switch evaporate the value of Bitcoin? I'm remembering Matt Damon in Interstellar trying to hijack the main ship and blowing it up.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:05:49
Depends on the coin I'm sure but probably so
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:41:43
Gold isn't exchanged without significant premiums either. It's still a well respected store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:44:40
I've seen tons of people with really shitty Kraken experiences of late. They took a week to respond after failing to verify my account and still haven't gotten back to me. Yawn. Coinbase it is
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:48:59
Very sorry to hear about your situation dude. Remember to always practice OPSEC and remember, there's a lot more value and dips between here and the moon.

I've seen most people lose money trading. The patient HODLing hands who buy low make the most money. 
Wait till there's a drop in price to buy.

Schiff is an adherent to Austrian economics but he fails to apply Austrian value theory here with his complaints about the lack of "intrinsic value". In Austrian theory, value is always subjective, personal, and extrinsic. There is no intrinsic value to gold, or to anything. 
He gives examples such as gold's usage in medical devices, jewelry, etc. but those all exist because people personally value those things and demand them. If people didn't extrinsically value gold and the things it can make, there would be no value to gold. Value is personal and no object in-itself has value. If 70 billion worth of demand exists for Bitcoin, it doesn't matter why, but people clearly value it. 
Even if you take his claims about gold's "intrinsic" value, Bitcoin holds unique characteristics that could be described as intrinsic. It is very divisible with 8 decimal places, it is decentralized and impossible to counterfeit, etc. 


It has practical uses and I think Bitcoin can be measured without fiat. In fact we should probably be measuring Bitcoin in terms of its relation to the price of gold which is the most historically stable current. 
At the end of the day though, just accept that Schiff makes money selling gold and this is a bias of his. Learn from the 90% of his content unrelated to Bitcoin, he's very economically knowledgeable.

I can buy anything in dirt, as long as the other person accepts it... For the most part Bitcoin is not accepted directly in most transactions.

And if my coins are stored on electrum these 2 new coins will still be accessible?
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:05:02
:) fuck the PMs vs cryptos debate. Both are vastly superior to EUR, USD, CAD, etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:43:41
I use Electrum which is extremely easy. I'm very into economics but I know literally nothing about Bitcoin aside from the basics. Buy on Coinbase and I can show you in PM how to set up an Electrum wallet to simply store your coins. Buy, download Electrum, then PM me later. Do not share your Electrum seed with anyone

Because of the supply cap and the huge expansion in market cap that remains ahead, moon.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:29:40
So it's like free money then?
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:05:13
Schiff is a smart investor but he's made less objective by his ownership of SchiffGold. His criticisms of Bitcoin all apply to gold as well. In reality owning both is a good idea. Bitcoin is risky and volatile and gold is stable. Both are decentralized, mined, and good stores of value.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:34:10
From what I've gleaned, the 2x plans represent a fundamental change and danger to BTC. I'm already "on", I just want to see if massive devaluation is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:06:27
Austrians say that money should be decentralized and based on supply and demand just like Bitcoin and gold both are. There is no intrinsic value to gold or to anything for that matter.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:28:47
When do you think the moon comes, after 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:42:26
Think about his criticisms, they all apply to gold. He's very smart, he can clearly see this. 
1. "BTC is always priced in fiat" - so is gold 
2. "You can't buy anything directly with BTC" - neither can you with gold 
3. "It's a speculative asset, not a currency" - so is gold
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:07:14
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:23:36
Yes. You can recover any coins in your wallet with that if you put any in.

Central banking is theft. By the way, Dodd Frank killed 1200 small banks and made too big to fail banks even bigger.

Damn how many btc do you own?
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:55:10
Gold has trillions in market cap and way more stable value than BTC yet still we don't buy things with it. Inflationary currencies like the dollar will remain the spending currencies.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:41:07
Who knows if he does. He's not transparent about his own investments or net worth. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:01:34
Most of his followers are interested in Austrian monetary policy and call him out anyway. I highly doubt he's stopped anyone from buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:35:49
Value is applied to objects by humans. Gold has value because people value it. Same with Bitcoin. Intrinsic value implies that the worth of something originates from something other than demand.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:19:56
I still highly recommend Schiff's book The Real Crash and he's still right about a lot of stuff. Just wrong and biased about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:27:13
Exactly. It doesn't matter much the fees because its role as a non inflationary store of value is winning. People rarely spend with gold.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:56:59
Limited supply tells the story here. It's a pretty simple equation, market cap divided by the # of million coins in circulation 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:15:49
I want tons of different kinds of competing currency. Fiat, crypto, gold backed paper currency, precious metals, as many possible ways for people to exchange and store value. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:56:54
There is a max supply of 21 million coins. Because the supply is limited and demand is growing rapidly and there is no way for supply to be expanded, the price will rise as people compete for access to the limited supply of coins. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;law of demand. 
Imagine 1 billion dollars in the Bitcoin market vs 70 billion. In either situation, the supply is the same, all that can change is the price.

That's HayekCoin
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:34:38
He understands Bitcoin and has been making these arguments forever. All his arguments apply to gold. He's trying to encourage people to buy gold which makes him money.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:24:42
Gold has utility whether its in conductors or medical devices or jewelry. It also has utility as a stable and longstanding store of value. It's arguable that the utility of gold is actually greater and more exclusive than what Bitcoin has to offer. I'm still more bullish on Bitcoin than on gold but gold is another decentralized currency that resists inflation very well.

Gold is still a haven. Wait till the bottom falls out of the dollar as interest rates rise 
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:58:46
I think there are 3 benefits unique to gold. First, 5000 years of use as a currency. Secondly it has trillions in active market cap. Finally, its price is vastly more stable than Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin however is better in terms of divisibility, ease of transfer, and huge monetary gains for people getting in right now.

It's called self interest. Get over his criticism, seriously. I don't see why people in the Bitcoin community are so upset by his complaints. It's clearly in his own interest to call BTC a bubble and shill for gold when he owns a gold trading company. He's been doing this for years.
