Hi, James from BitPay here. We apologize for your long wait, and it's clear we need to update any messaging that gave you an incorrect impression of your wait time. We have been dealing with a massive growth in support tickets due to rising bitcoin adoption and accompanying network delays + fee increases. We're currently hiring additional support resources, but we are dealing with a large backlog of requests right now.
We do aim to prioritize transaction inquiries that require refunds. We failed you here, and we're sorry you had to experience this wait for a refund on your expired invoice. If you can DM me your request ID or the transaction ID itself, I'll see that your refund gets submitted ASAP. 
We're working on platform improvements to prevent expired payments altogether, and we've already made some big steps with the [Bitcoin Payment Protocol]( to dramatically reduce payment issues requiring refunds. We're confident that these sorts of payment issues (and support wait times) will become a thing of the past in 2018. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience and your feedback. We'll keep working to do better for you and users like you.

@_date: 2019-07-22 22:03:49
As a matter of course, we don't typically delete past blog posts, particularly ones which are controversial and/or still widely cited. We have quite a few posts related to Segwit2x which will also still remain online, as we have no wish to censor the historical record (for better or for worse) of the time of that scaling proposal. We can certainly make an update to the advisory that this is related to protocol changes happening in 2017, in case anyone is reading it later.

Hi James from BitPay here. Welcome to the wonderful world of Bitcoin! And thanks for using our wallet :) 
If you have bought Bitcoin from an exchange, you can send the funds to your BitPay app wallet so you can control your keys and your funds directly: 
When you want to send funds from your BitPay wallet to another Bitcoin wallet address, check out this video guide: 
We have a great guide to paying with Bitcoin at BitPay merchants here: 
And when you're ready can go and shop at some of BitPay's merchants at our directory of featured merchants :) 
Let me know if you have any other questions!
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:58:04
Thanks for taking the time to make this further reply :) It sounds like BitPay isn't serving the kinds of use cases you want from Bitcoin, so I that other types of services will help to fill those gaps. And on the payment processing side, we're most often serving a part of the market where organizations want to take advantage of the crypto's advancements for payments (fraud resistance, global reach, etc) but often aren't ready to change up accounting/tax practices and internal tech to manage the volatility and legal complications of holding crypto directly. 
On the other hand, lots of folks use the BitPay app and Copay app to hold, too. So we're happy to serve the hardest-core Bitcoiners as well :) 
All that said, I'll leave the rest to Reddit to decide. Peace to you and thanks for the conversation! I reckon we'll both continue to try to move this great tech forward as best as we can, so I'm wishing you luck :)
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:57:55
Thanks for the reply! I'm sorry to hear that we don't have your trust, and I realize these issues are deep. And I really appreciate the critiques, because they help us to think critically and work to communicate better. 
I don't expect I'll convince you to love us **;)** but will do my best to do justice to your questions. Hopefully we can at least part ways with a better understanding of each other **:)** 
**1)** Definitely understand that Segwit2x was a controversial scaling proposal. I'll try to focus on the blog post you referenced (more on S2X as a whole further down):
At the time of that August 2017 [blog post advisory]( for the small population of people/companies running their own nodes of [Bitcore]( (before the November date of projected Segwit2x activation), the vast majority of mining power was signaling support for the Segwit2x hard fork to 2MB blocks.
So there was a reasonable if ultimately wrong projection that if a chain split occurred, anyone running a node not with the majority chain would be left without sufficient hashing power for a functional blockchain. Hence that note you cited. Obviously as the November fork date neared, Segwit2x lost steam and did not materialize. But in advance of what seemed a likely fork for quite some time, the risk of a dysfunctional minority fork was a legitimate concern for everybody (both Segwit2x supporters and opponents). 
**P.S.** the term "adopt" was one written into the post before the date of the hard fork, so it would not have been read as implying that the chain had already been adopted. Likely meant to imply the support/signaling of the intention to adopt. Understand the critique, though, as the advisory blog post just did not receive a later update note to reflect that Segwit2x was not in the end adopted. That would be a good addendum for us to make in case anyone comes across this post now and is confused. 
If you're curious about followup, we did publish a blog to clarify our perspective on Segwit2x after the blog post you referenced: 
Ultimately, we decided to suspend our support for the Segwit2x scaling proposal. You can read about that here: 
 


**2)** There's a lot to break down in that post about BIP70/Payment Protocol, but we address some of the concerns around privacy and SSL/PKI (RE: digital certificate issuance) here: 
- **Privacy**: Even without Payment Protocol, BitPay.com invoices or the merchant website already detect your phone/computer's IP address when you pay. Additionally, use of Payment Protocol does not prevent folks from using VPNs or Tor (we still process payments for many of the web's biggest VPN providers). 
- **Centralized market/provision of PKI/SSL** Most of the web (including Reddit here) uses SLL/PKI, so it's hard to point to much better if you're after security. Before Payment Protocol, users were already trusting BitPay's SSL certificate to verify that a BitPay.com invoice truly belonged to BitPay. Payment Protocol just added an extra layer of security to the direct fetching of payment information so users could know that no scripts/viruses/etc were inserting hackers' addresses. 
If you're curious, we've also released and developed version of Payment Protocol which uses [ECDSA (Bitcoin cryptography)]( which allows a more direct validation chain. 
I definitely encourage you to check out [why we actually introduced Payment Protocol]( For instance ([from the FAQ]( 




**3)** The [BitPay wallet]( is 100% non-custodial. Users hold their keys for every wallet, and BitPay doesn't hold keys for anyone. We're big believers in user-owned security, and there's strong multi-sig functionality in there that I sure wish more folks would try out. It's one of the best ways out there to secure keys. 
Thanks again for the questions and critiques! Lots of the nuance gets lost online, so I appreciate the opportunity to have the discussion, though we may end up agreeing to disagree. Let me know if you have any questions, and peace! **:)**

We at BitPay have also seen cases of people receiving these fake updates prompting install of a fake/malicious "4.0.0" version. Users' funds are directed toward attackers' addresses when they attempt to send transactions (including paying BitPay merchants): 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:25:26
Hi, James from BitPay here. We want to investigate this and help out if we can. We're always sorry to hear when purchasers have a rough time, and we're always looking to make our payment processing better so that fewer mistakes happen and no money is eaten up in the process due to fees, etc.
Note that BitPay locks in a USD &lt;&gt; BTC exchange rate for you and for Newegg 15 minutes, as shown on the invoice you pay. Exchange rate changes would only affect you if your wallet did not broadcast the payment in 15 minutes (most wallets broadcast instantly, exchange accounts do not). 
If you did underpay, BitPay cannot accept the underpayment for the merchant. Only the merchant can choose to credit an underpaid order.
We'll need some more transaction information to see why  you see a discrepancy in what you sent. Can you shoot us an email at support with the receiving bitcoin address, invoice ID, or txid and PM here on Reddit when it's sent? I'll personally investigate your issue.
Since you reference payment amounts in dollars, it sounds like you may have typed the USD amount of the Newegg order into your own bitcoin wallet. This would not have accounted for the BitPay network cost fee or for BitPay’s locked in exchange rate. Many bitcoin wallets also use slightly different bitcoin exchange rates. This is why we do not show a USD amount on the BitPay invoice, and we encourage BitPay purchasers to send the exact BTC amount shown on the invoice. Using a wallet that scans the BitPay invoice QR code and prepopulates the correct information in your sending wallet is the best way to do this: 
We're rolling out some big improvements very soon to prevent payments from wallets which can underpay or overpay completely, eliminating the possibility of this scenario: 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:56:16
James from BitPay here. Bitcoin wallets decide what OP_RETURN outputs to include in a transaction. It doesn't look like this user is using a BitPay wallet. It's unclear from the screenshot/tweet what wallet they're using.

@_date: 2017-12-17 19:04:18
Hi, Can you share an example of a transaction ID that's missing? 
If it's on the Bitcoin network and you and your recipient both have your private keys (as you do with Copay and BitPay), you have not lost funds.
If it's still not received a confirmation from a bitcoin miner, then the funds have not moved.
The Bitcoin [mempool of unconfirmed transactions]( is currently very large. If a transaction does not confirm after a certain period of time or will not be added by a miner, the transaction is pruned from the Bitcoin blockchain and the funds become available for spending by the sender. This may be the case for what you are seeing.
Additionally, some block explorers query larger sets of the mempool than others, which may explain why some block explorers show your transaction and others do not.
We're always looking to improve our products, and we're working to make Insight more reliable for periods of network congestion. So thanks for your feedback!

Hi, We appreciate your frustration and your feedback here. 
Without the transaction info requested, however, we can't help with identifying amounts + expiration window/broadcast timestamp + [fee costs]( for these particular payments. 
No one wins when wallets send transactions late or underpaid/overpaid. We benefit and you benefit only from a successful payment. There is a [bitcoin miner fee]( cost for us to send refunds back to users in these cases. Any deduction in the underpaid amount refunded only goes to pay the miner fee cost of sending your refund back to you. BitPay does not benefit from that cost – it's purely a cost of sending money on the network.
We've tried to make our payment experience compatible with as many bitcoin solutions as possible in part to give purchasers a choice of what services to use. But we've seen and heard the feedback from users who have these problems with late/delayed or underpaid/overpaid [exchange payments]( (and w/ exchanges which deduct fees also). We're taking action on that. We are working now to progressively roll a requirement for payments from wallets which support a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal called Payment Protocol. This improvement eliminates most common bitcoin payment errors, though only a few bitcoin wallets support it currently. Learn more: 
Thank you again for your feedback, and we're sorry you had this experience. Helpings users avoid situations like this is a top priority for us, so we take your complaint here seriously.

Hi, James from BitPay here. We're sorry to hear that you had a poor experience with the call center for the card. We will be bringing this complaint to their attention and taking action to ensure that it does not happen again. 
We will also be getting you those refunds for the small amounts that were charged as test deposits. We have a clear policy to waive fees in these test deposit circumstances as you mentioned, and we will be working to identify why it was not followed by the agent you spoke to. You can expect to see the charges ($15 total) returned to your card balance in the next 48 hours at most. 
**Note that there are no fees for setting up direct deposit to the card.** We do have a publicly-listed $5 ACH debit fee on our fee schedule for times when you withdraw dollars **off** of your BitPay Card via bank transfer, but no fee is charged when you make direct deposits or bitcoin-to-dollar loads to the card. 
Because this card was made for in-person, online, or ATM transactions rather than for ACH debit/bank transfers, we recommend that you only use ACH debits for transfers greater than $500 so that the transactions are more economical for you. It's possible to transfer as much as $24,495 (your max card balance) for only a $5 fee.
Here again is the fee schedule for the card: 
We've sent an email to you and will keep you updated on the status of the credits. Please let us know if you have any additional questions in the meantime.

James from BitPay here. Thanks for reaching out to our team! We appreciate your concern over this issue. 
**TLDR: BitPay does not block either VPN or Tor users. This is a Cloudflare/Tor issue that we're investigating, and we are developing a fix to this issue for Tor users. There is an immediate workaround detailed at the bottom of this post**
The issue you're experiencing is a known issue with Cloudflare (our CDN) that we're working on currently. 
In this case, Cloudflare is intercepting a BitPay invoice request (what's happening when you go to pay with bitcoin at a BitPay merchant) and is requiring a captcha to prove that the user is a person and not a robot. 
Cloudflare tends to do this with requests made over Tor at a much higher rate. The way this captcha is delivered by Cloudflare to the Tor browser is taking users to an archived invoice page and not allowing them to proceed with a payment. The captcha itself may not be displayed depending on how risky/trustworthy Cloudflare considers a particular IP address.
This captcha issue appears to be specific to the Tor browser bundle and not to Tor in general. Our team has tested and confirmed that vanilla Firefox over Tor presents the Cloudflare captcha correctly and allows users to proceed to payment. 
**Our no-script invoice should work for Tor users in the meantime as we work on this issue.** If you generate an invoice, simply copy the invoice ID for the invoice in question (E.g. JWi53uinKVUxhe72jCoqY in  into the following URL: 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions. And thank you for your patience as we work on this one – and for using BitPay.

Hi there! James from BitPay here. The BitPay Card lets you load up a dollar balance from a bitcoin wallet, then shop with Visa merchants and get cash from Visa-compatible ATMs. It's available and legal in all 50 states. Funds take only one block confirmation (usually seconds, sometimes minutes) to load after you send a bitcoin payment. 
You can check it out here: 
Let me know if you have any other questions! :) Would love to get feedback from other folks here who may have used our card. 
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:38:53
Hi - I appreciate your response and your feedback. We are taking action. If you'll allow us to give you a refund in the meantime, please accept it.
@_date: 2016-06-27 13:46:31
Hi, there. James from BitPay here. Sorry to hear about your experience so far.
Have you activated and registered your card? You're able to load bitcoin in your card dashboard at bitpay.com/visa/dashboard with the "Add Funds" button. That lets you pick a load amount and creates a QR code you can pay from any bitcoin wallet to load your card with USD funds.
Check to make sure you're not logged in to your BitPay merchant account, and reach out to us at cardservices if you have any additional questions.
@_date: 2019-11-07 00:09:38
Hi James from BitPay here. Right off the bat, I want to apologize: you shouldn't have had to wait 30 minutes to get on a call. That's something we absolutely have to improve. 
It's not much, but we'd like to offer you a refund at least for your card order fee. If you email support and then PM me here on Reddit, I'll make sure it's taken care of quickly. 
Reading your comment, were you referring to cash back (getting cash from your current balance at point of sale) or cash advances (getting a loan)? Over the counter cash back transactions were unavailable between March and late September, but they **are** available now. Is it possible you meant that you were wanting to use **cash back** rather than **cash advances**? Apologies if I'm misunderstanding, but this is how your comment read to me. 
If you're having issues there, I can assure you that cash back should be working, and we're happy to escalate this to the card services provider to find out what may have caused a decline.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:42:56
James from BitPay here. If the bitcoin transaction reaches 6 confirmations, the funds will be credited to the merchant, which should allow your order to be completed. Please reach out to the merchant directly if you need assistance with order fulfillment.
If the bitcoin transaction never confirms, then the funds will be spendable again by your bitcoin wallet. This can take up to 4 weeks after the bitcoin transaction has been created. You may want to reach out to your bitcoin wallet support with the above transaction details for further assistance if you have problems here.

@_date: 2017-08-01 17:50:06
Hi, James from BitPay here. We're sorry you didn't get a timely response from our team on your issue. Have you received help yet?
You should never use external sites to load your BitPay Card. Sites like this do not broadcast bitcoin transactions in real time, so it's practically inevitable that transactions will arrive after the BitPay Card invoice (for loading your card) has expired. We always recommend using [a true bitcoin wallet]( like the [BitPay wallet]( to load the card. If you'd like you can receive payouts from your service at your bitcoin wallet address, then load your BitPay Card. 
If the service did end up sending a transaction to an expired BitPay invoice, we can help you get a refund. If you did not receive help from our support team already, please send me a direct message here on Reddit with your email address and we'll help you out ASAP.
@_date: 2019-11-26 21:16:49

The BitPay Card includes all of the standard consumer protections provided by its issuing bank as well as by Visa. If you choose to run your transactions as credit transactions (i.e. with a signature instead of PIN entry), you will receive the same [zero liability protection]( Visa offers to credit card holders.

Hi, Thanks for your questions! I think they're on a lot of peoples' minds.
1) Some people receive their pay or part of their pay in BTC or have bitcoin savings they need to liquidate quickly (to pay bills, for emergencies, for funds while they're traveling from country to country, etc.). 
Instead of selling online and waiting 2-3 days for a bank transfer to clear to their accounts, they can use the BitPay Card to turn bitcoin into a Visa-spendable dollar balance in minutes. If they go to an ATM, they can have cash in hand in less than 3 minutes from loading the Card (sometimes faster). 
We hope this Card makes life better for them – and lets them continue to receive their pay in bitcoin or keep their primary savings in bitcoin. 
2) Making a great bitcoin payment experience (and in turn, making bitcoin every business's favorite way to get paid) has been BitPay's core mission for more than five years. It still is. Keep an eye on [our blog]( as we announce more new bitcoin-accepting merchants in the next months.
But while you're waiting on us to make that merchant adoption happen, we wanted to use our platform to give bitcoin users a way to shop and get cash for bitcoin. That's what this Card is. With our [bitcoin wallet]( and our [merchant payment experience]( it's part of the toolkit for bitcoin payments today. We understand if it's not what everyone needs or wants, but we'll continue to offer it as long as it creates value for bitcoin users. 
P.S. Just a thought, but as more non-bitcoin merchants see folks using bitcoin-friendly debit cards (and not just ours), they may be more likely to start treating bitcoin users as a demographic force to be reckoned with and accepted. [I think I've got Chik-fil-A thinking about it ;)](

Hi, The BitPay Card is a standard prepaid card, so any transactions with the card (after you've loaded dollars via your bitcoin wallet) are just like transactions with your credit or debit card.
If you have questions about taxes related to bitcoin transactions, you can view the [IRS's official guidance](
(obligatory: I'm not an attorney, BitPay doesn't provide legal or tax advice, etc.)
@_date: 2016-11-06 12:37:15
James from BitPay here. Thanks for reaching out!  Replied to your support message.
If you attempted to use a prepaid Visa debit card like the BitPay Card to make a credit/swipe/signature transaction at a hotel, gas pump, rental agency, or restaurant, the merchant would have placed a funds hold on the card greater than the amount you intended to spend. 
After the merchant settles the transaction the unspent funds from the held transaction can be added back into your account balance. This is standard for Visa prepaid cards in these scenarios.
For future reference, using your PIN number at the pump is the most convenient method to avoid a hold. If you want to use a credit/swipe/signature transaction to pay, be sure to pay inside the gas station at the counter.
Please feel free to follow up with us via email if you have any questions about the authorization hold placed by the merchant.

Great question! That would really depend on how you use bitcoin. Do you find yourself needing to turn bitcoin into your local currency often? 
The Card does work anywhere Visa is accepted outside of the US, [as well as with international ATMs]( though there are additional standard currency conversion fees of 3% for spending and a $3 fee for international ATM withdrawals. 
Note that you will need to have a home address in the US in order to apply for a card right now.

Hi I work at BitPay and would like to try to answer some of these objections. You have some fair and unfair critiques - would you be open to a conversation to sort them out? 


Could you share why you believe that? And why would that be in our favor? 90%+ of our volume comes from people who use Bitcoin (BTC), and we make money when people pay successfully. We aren't trying to kill our own business by driving people away. ([And we explain how we calculate the Network Cost fee for both coins we support - and why we charge the fee](


Contrary to popular belief, we aren't trying to promote one coin over another. We're trying to 1) help people use blockchain technology to accept and make payments and 2) operate a profitable business. A small company that wants to do both doesn't have the luxury of politics. Is there something in particular that makes you think we're trying to promote BCH over BTC?
We're going to process a good many more coins and digital assets - it doesn't mean we're trying to endorse coins and everything associated to them. I realize the fork coins aren't popular here. Criticize them, by all means. But there are plenty of decent people and businesses who use other blockchains who aren't "scamming" anyone. 


BitPay uses a [modified version of BIP-70 (Payment Protocol)]( which coordinates payment between a wallet and the receiving merchant's (BitPay's) server. This very successfully **prevents** major payment errors (overpaying, underpaying, sending insufficient miner fees and creating "stuck" transactions, sending payments to old or expired invoices) that can add up to make Bitcoin payments unusable for companies (like Steam). We used to receive thousands of payment errors a week (EDIT: more than a thousand, not thousands) - [error rates have dropped significantly since]( 
Is there a definition of a standard Bitcoin payment anymore? There are many opt-in features like RBF and SegWit. Some people use them, some people don't. Even if non-standard, how is an attempted improvement to the standard (even if arguable) a bad thing? (EDIT: to be clear, I understand that a protocol improvement proposal (like BIP70) has less standing than a merged feature like RBF/SegWit)


We do have to be sure we aren't sending Bitcoin to really bad dudes, imposters, etc. We do our best to keep ID verification from being onerous, though - would you be willing to share feedback about why it's excessive?  


I'm not sure what you're referencing. Can you explain? 


This is a fair critique. While you can send to bech32/Segwit addresses in the BitPay wallet app (recent change) and send from bech32/Segwit addresses to BitPay invoices (since early 2018), we don't have full Segwit support yet in the BitPay wallet app (i.e. generating Segwit addresses). We balance requests like Segwit with requests from our merchants for support for things like other cryptocurrencies (which will boost their bottom lines) - and that has meant delays for Segwit. 


Fair critique also, for those who want Lightning as a feature. We are monitoring the progress of the Lightning Network, but we don’t yet have firm plans for deployment on BitPay's platform. That may change, especially if that's where a lot of usage of cryptocurrency payments happens. We're not focused on the micropayments/payment channels use case currently. 


By all means - making Bitcoin useful for the world is going to take a lot of companies and groups taking a lot of different approaches. I encourage people to try out whatever works for them in their Bitcoin toolkit. But Blockchain and BitPay both have good products that can make life with Bitcoin better.

To avoid future overpayments, please be sure to use a true wallet like BitPay whenever you pay with bitcoin. As long as you either scan the QR code or enter the exact BTC amount (rather than the USD amount) listed on the invoice into your wallet, you should be free and clear of this issue.

On the contrary: two of the longest-running, most creatively prolific Bitcoin companies partner to help you use Bitcoin to do things and solve problems. 
- Live in another country and paying high interchange fees on international credit card payments? Use your Blockchain wallet and shop with BitPay merchants. 
- Live in a country suffering from high inflation? Mine Bitcoin and pay for things with a Blockchain wallet at BitPay merchants. 
- Need to send/receive a large client payment from overseas but don't like waiting days or weeks? Use BitPay to invoice or Blockchain to send. 
There is so much work to be done to make payments (a big part of everyones' lives) more tolerable. This helps.

James from BitPay here. BitPay is actively working with AmazonWatch so they are able to accept larger donations.
For background, for higher payment processing volumes BitPay collects additional information from organizations who use BitPay to process Bitcoin donations or payments. Because AmazonWatch was not verified for higher processing level at the time the donor visited their site, the donor was unable to create a BitPay payment invoice for that amount.

You're right that there is no $5 dormancy fee except in the case that the card lies completely unused for 90 days. All you have to do to avoid the fee is make a small purchase, ATM withdrawal, or load.

Hi, James from BitPay here. As other commenters have noted, the rise in the Network Cost fee reflects the recent spike in average miner fees on the Bitcoin network: 
Our Network Cost is based on Bitcoin Core's 2-block conservative fee estimate, so it rises and falls with that miner fee level. 
Please let us know if you have any other questions!

Hi, there! Thanks for clarifying. There are order payments which businesses accept through BitPay's payment processing (this was not one of them).
When you send from a bitcoin wallet like BitPay's, the transaction is being processed directly by the Bitcoin miner network. It looks like the transaction in question has already gained more than six confirmations, so your bitcoin address (if you provided it correctly to the sender) has the funds:
Was this transaction sent from a friend to your bitcoin wallet? We will follow up with you via private message so you can provide a screenshot of your issue with the BitPay app.

Hi, James from BitPay here. We're sorry to hear you had trouble paying from your Ledger wallet – our goal isn't to stop anyone from paying with Bitcoin (we only succeed as a business when people can pay). 
We are working to make adoption of Payment Protocol easier for other wallets (including hardware wallets), and we have made a [simpler version of Payment Protocol]( available for easy implementation. We'll be posting updates soon as more wallets make this secure payment option available. 
In the meantime, [here is a walkthrough]( for using Ledger with a secure Payment Protocol wallet. Please let us know if there is anything we can clarify or explain better! 
Our choice to require payments from [secure Payment Protocol wallets]( wasn't arbitrary.  We made the switch to protect purchasers and merchants from the cost of payment mistakes and guarantee a successful payment experience. Across the BitPay platform, various failed payments and overpayments once ranged between several percentage points to up to 10% of payments processed. After Payment Protocol, that percentage is now less than 1/10th of a percent. Payment Protocol wallets work, and they prevent serious problems that can discourage people from using Bitcoin for commerce payments: 
That said, we're sorry we didn't communicate this clearly enough to prevent confusion for you when you went to checkout on updated BitPay invoices. That's on us, and we take responsibility to make the payment experience as simple and seamless as possible. Thank you for your feedback!

Hi James from BitPay here again. Thank you for posting this and sharing your situation. Our partner FirstView closed these accounts without advance notice to BitPay and has so far not provided the email addresses of the affected card accounts. So right now we don't have the means to reach out to the individuals affected. 
We'll take advantage of this thread to share a small PSA for anyone affected:
1) Cardholders will receive outstanding card balances via mailed check from FirstView. 
2) Cardholders with suspended cards should *NOT* attempt to load their cards with additional funds. If you loaded your card with dollars via BitPay after your card was suspended, please reach out to us ( to claim a refund.

Hi, James from BitPay here. The bitcoin doesn't need to be "sent" (i.e. fully confirmed on the blockchain) in 15 minutes. Your wallet only needs to broadcast the payment in those 15 minutes for the BitPay invoice to detect a transaction. 
Any true bitcoin wallet will broadcast instantaneously. Account services and exchanges like Coinbase and Poloniex do not broadcast in real time (though you may see a "funds sent" message) but instead batch and send transactions later.
Please be sure to use one of the true bitcoin wallets listed here and you should have no issues:

Hi James at BitPay here. Wanted to drop in to help clarify this.
The Network Cost is a fee BitPay charges to cover some of our miner fee costs ([a more detailed explanation of our UTXO sweep fees here]( Like anyone, our miner fee costs are variable based on network conditions ([miner fees can rise and fall sharply]( of the blockchain the purchaser chooses to pay on. That’s why the Network Cost changes, too. 
We assess this fee based on BCH network conditions, too, but right now our estimated miner fee cost for sweeping a BCH payment is lower than our threshold. From our FAQ on this: 


We answer some frequently asked questions about the Network Cost fee (including how we calculate the fees) here:

Hi, James from BitPay here. Our system automatically sends you an email when you hit your tier limit, and you would have received an additional email with each new invoice your customers attempted to create above your limit. Additionally, our system blocks invoice creation/payment collection if your tier is exceeded, so your customers would not have been able to send any funds to us during this period.
We're glad to help investigate, but we have no details about your company name or case from this Reddit post. Do you have a request ID with our support team that I can help address? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:58:04
Hi! James from BitPay here. We always advise against using bitcoin exchanges to pay BitPay invoices. Exchanges do not broadcast bitcoin transactions in real time, meaning that payments can be shown as "sent" and only get broadcast long after the BitPay payment request has expired (we guarantee an exchange rate for only 15 minutes). This can be a real headache for you and for us. 
Exchanges (we can't speak for Bittrex) also occasionally deduct fees on outgoing payments, which can mean that your payment becomes underpaid and has to be refunded, further deducting our own miner fee costs for returning the payment.
If you want to avoid that, transfer funds from Bittrex to one of the "true" bitcoin wallets listed here:  Then use the true bitcoin wallet for your shopping.
These wallets broadcast payments instantaneously so our payment requests can detect them. Be sure to get a wallet that can scan the QR code. That helps to eliminate the risk of underpayment or overpayment.

Hi, James from BitPay here. It sounds like you spoke to the cardholder services call center (third-party).

James from BitPay here. Sorry to hear about your issue!
The load limits are calculated using paid and unpaid invoices, so if you started a deposit and didn't finish, this would have counted toward your load total (since it is possible in some cases to pay unpaid invoices later). It's a system precaution to prevent exceeding daily load limits required by the card's issuing bank. 
This resets every day, though, so you should be able to make a full card load now without issue. If this continues, let me know and we will investigate further. Thanks for your patience!

The emails would have come from noreply with the subject line "Approved Volume Limit Exceeded." I'll be asking my team to investigate whether these emails were potentially blocked (if you unsubscribed from any previous emails, or marked us as spam, our system emails would be undeliverable). 
Per your additional question here on refunds below the sendable bitcoin amount:
This error message indicates that while there is a valid transaction associated with those invoices, the amount is less than the minimum amount for refunding a transaction*.
There is a minimum amount required for refunds because sending any bitcoin transaction (including bitcoin refunds) requires bitcoin miner fees: 
If the bitcoin amount remaining when a customer underpays an invoice is less than the bitcoin miner fee required to send the bitcoin transaction successfully, BitPay does not initiate the refund. BitPay is also unable to access the funds because of this fee limitation.
We're so sorry you had to experience this wait to get an answer.
Bitcoin has been undergoing a period of significant changes which have drastically increased our support inquiry volume. We're working hard to prevent that from affecting customers who need help, but it has meant that many users have had much longer wait times for help. 
To get back to meeting our service standards of resolution within 3 business days, we are hiring additional resources and making some significant improvements to our platform to reduce the incidence of issues in the first place. 
In the meantime, thank you again for your patience. We understand if you need to find another service, but we appreciate you using our platform and we appreciate this feedback as we work to improve our users' experience.

Hi! James from BitPay here. If the wallet is recommending a high miner fee, it may be because your funds total is made of a large number of inputs (bitcoin received in multiple different transactions). All of those inputs typically require miner fees to move.
There are two things you can do here:
1) Combine all of those different inputs into a single new input by using the "send max" to send the funds to a new wallet together in one transaction. After that's done, sending transactions will require less of a miner fee contribution. 
AND/OR 
2) Customize your bitcoin miner fee for the transaction:

The Network Cost has been part of BitPay invoices for nearly a year, with public explainer ( 
We take care to explain that this is not the same as the miner fee (this article linked on all BTC invoices):  
The Network Cost (and the percentage of the payment it is) is variable based on the transaction size and on Bitcoin network conditions (calculated via the `bitcoind` client of Bitcoin Core for a 2-block miner fee estimate). 
You can view the exact Network Cost on the BitPay invoice before you pay (see invoice example at bitpay.com/how-to-pay. You can choose not to pay if the Network Cost is too high due to network conditions at the time.

Hi, James from BitPay here. Here's a quick explainer on the fee you're talking about (Network Cost). 
Network Cost has been a part of BitPay invoices since March 2017. It covers BitPay's miner fee cost for moving the funds received to BitPay invoices. Check out this article linked on all BTC invoices: 
The higher relative costs of the BTC Network Cost are due to the higher miner fee costs of transaction on the Bitcoin network. Because fees on the Bitcoin network have declined, this fee has also declined. The amount of the fee is based on the bitcoind (Bitcoin Core daemon) fee recommendations for 2-block inclusion, so it adjusts with network conditions – it's not arbitrary. 
We have no reasons to make it hard for BTC users to pay us. We earn money on our payment processing service only when our merchants make revenue. 
RE: Payment Protocol, eight different major bitcoin wallets support it, including Bitcoin Core, BRD, Mycelium. We have been [working to make it easy]( for more wallets to add Payment Protocol functionality. 
We adopted a Payment Protocol requirement because of the massive rates of payment errors our merchants were receiving, which often resulted in money lost to purchasers. This problem came to a head in December, when miner fees were so high that many users could not even receive refunds for payment errors due to miner fee levels. 
If you are curious about why we made the decision to switch, please check out what we've written about it. 
Payment Protocol has already significantly reduced payment errors:

Hi, James from BitPay here. Please note that BitPay does not put transaction holds on cards. 
If a merchant placed a [pre-authorization hold]( on your card, the held funds would be unspendable until the remainder of the transaction settled to the merchant. This would cause your card to be declined by Visa-accepting POS terminals and sites. This hold happened over the Visa payment rails and would have been initiated by the merchant automatically. 
**Unfortunately, there is nothing BitPay can do to accelerate the hold removal process.** Typically merchants remove pre-authorization holds within a few days once the transaction settles. If they do not remove the transaction hold, our Visa processor is authorized to return the held funds to a card only after 30 days have passed. 
Please call the cardholder services number shown on the back of your BitPay Card. This team represents the Visa processor and has direct insight into the USD holds and transactions placed over the Visa network. If you can provide them with written authorization from the merchant to release the hold manually, they can perform the release sooner than 30 days. We have been working with the processor to shorten this release period policy for some time, but unfortunately it is not within our power to change it. 
If you have any reason to believe that a Visa transaction or pre-authorization hold placed by a merchant was fraudulent, the cardholder services call center can also assist you with submitting a dispute form. This would allow you to reclaim funds if the Visa transaction was found to be fraudulent.

If a Visa merchant puts a hold on funds (see answer above), this hold happens over the Visa network and is not performed or reversible by BitPay.

Hi, James from BitPay here. 
The BitPay Card issued in the United States by Metropolitan Commercial Bank is *completely unaffected* by Wave Crest’s announcement, and we will continue to support and release new features for our US cardholders in all 50 US states. 
The BitPay Card issued by Wave Crest Holdings Ltd. internationally will continue to be available and supported in the European territories (mychoicecorporate.com/visa-card-issuance-list/).
The email in question was sent to all of Wave Crest’s BitPay cardholders outside of the European territories and the US. You can view it here, along with the steps we’re taking to help cardholders affected by the change:  
As we state in the email, we still look forward to continuing our work with Visa in the US and the European territories, and we’re working to restore support to our cardholders in other countries soon.

Correct - if HKFP decides to restore the BitPay option on their site, they can accept BTC payments from customers (and customers could send BTC to them) without issue.

Hi, James from BitPay here. We're sorry to hear about your issue!
If you sent other transactions to the invoice after it expired, the transactions would not be credited to the invoice. We will need to refund them. Please send us an email at **support with the invoice ID, receiving bitcoin address, or transaction IDs associated to your payments.
If you sent a BTC payment (or payments) denominated  in a particular dollar amount rather than the exact BTC amount listed on the invoice, it's likely that your wallet or exchange service was using a different bitcoin exchange rate than BitPay's. This would explain the original underpayment. Again, it is important to send an exact BTC amount from your wallet rather than a dollar-equivalent amount for this reason.
You can view BitPay's exchange rates here: 
We will need to investigate your payment more closely to check the transactions which went into this payment and give you a better answer as to what refund amount you should expect. We're glad to post back here if you prefer, or handle this over email (support We'll look out for your transaction details! Thanks!

We've had the integration in the app for about a month. Previously you would have needed a beta invite to get started with the exchange service itself.
Now, if you initiate your signup through Copay (and if you're in one of the US states Glidera supports) you won't be prompted for an invite code.

- Social security number
- Photo of government-issued photo ID/driver's license 
- Bank deposit verification

This allows us to guarantee a bitcoin exchange rate for a limited period of time to protect you and the merchant from bitcoin price volatility. Sorry to hear you had issues!

@_date: 2017-06-16 16:00:13
Both of these payments you provided were confirmed on the Bitcoin network and credited to the merchant's BitPay account. BitPay cannot refund the fully paid invoices after the money has been credited to the merchant, so you will need to reach out to the merchant you paid if you would like to request a refund for your orders. 
BitPay does not control confirmation times on the bitcoin network and does not receive your bitcoin miner fee. This fee goes to pay the miners which confirm transactions the Bitcoin network. 
Every BitPay invoice shows an itemized list of the amount plus the network cost which BitPay adds. This network cost fee is not hidden.  The money is also not kept by BitPay. The additional network cost included in your invoice total covers the miner fee cost of BitPay's UTXO sweep for your payment. You can learn more about what this fee is on our public help site: 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions! 
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:36:04
We're sorry to hear that your order did not work out, and we'd be glad to do anything we can to help you get a refund if the merchant's refund policies allow for it. Please feel free to copy in support in your email to the merchant if we can assist.
It's a challenge right now to ensure fast Bitcoin network confirmations unless you're willing to pay the network a sufficient bitcoin miner fee. This is affecting some purchases more than others.
Please note that BitPay does not "delay" payments. The merchant has the option to choose to receive payments at 0-confirmations, 1-confirmation, and 6 confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain. If your payment takes longer to reach the merchant's required confirmations, this does correlate to fee size, which is the Bitcoin network's criterion for prioritizing transactions. BitPay does not arbitrarily choose fee recommendations here, either.  We recommend the Bitcoin network's (specifically Bitcoin Core's fee algorithm) recommended fee. 
Thank you again for this feedback. We respect your choice to try other services, but we will be continuing to work to improve our buying experience based on stories like yours. We see plenty of work ahead to make this experience all it can be.

James from BitPay here. First of all, I'm sorry to hear about your experiences and want to apologize for the hassle. For you and for other folks looking for the BitPay Card, I did want to chime in to help clarify on the issue you ran into. 
It sounds like you mistakenly tried signing up for a BitPay merchant account (bitpay.com/dashboard/signup) thinking it was the application for a BitPay Card (bitpay.com/visa/order). Note that no one is ever required to interact with compliance when ordering the BitPay Card – but because you were mistakenly signing up for one of our merchant/business accounts as an individual, some red flags were set off in our system.
This is on us. Clearly we need to do a better job at making this account distinction clear to people visiting the site. Again, we apologize for the confusion in that. And we're glad to hear that you found what you needed.
