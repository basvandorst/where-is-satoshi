I am a bit of a noobie at this. do you have any youtube tutorials that could be of help? I'm (embarrassingly) in a bit over my head.

I'm on Mac will it work the same? I really appreciate your feedback man!

Yes. I backed up my previous Bitcoin-Qt wallet.dat from there. 
So If I understand correctly I just delete the current wallet.dat and replace it with the backed-up Qt wallet.dat? And then my bitcoins will appear in my Bitcoin Core wallet? Thanks again.

Hi, thanks for the response. Been waiting close to 30min. Is this normal? Getting kind of nervous. 
edit: it keeps automatically closing.

I previously had my bitcoins stored on Bitcoin-Qt wallet but the program had issues and refused to open. So I backed up my wallet.dat and installed Bitcoin Core wallet. I want to know how I can safely transfer my bitcoins into my new Bitcoin Core wallet.
I apologize if this is a confusing or silly question. I'm a bit of a newbie at this and I'm a bit overwhelmed. Any suggestions would help.

For sure. One of my fav publications. As much as they are focused on high-fashion menswear, celebrities and sophisticated lifestyle they cover innovative tech trends as well. Great magazine. Thanks for the stats.

Interesting insight. Thanks for the feedback. Can you expand upon why they would hate me? (is it the money related connection or taking time off for a big chunk of time? I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way).

Ah, good points. I'll make sure to keep things on the DL. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:21:14
Yikes! Didn't know that. Thanks for the heads up.

Thanks for the feedback! It looks like this is still a bit of a grey area in from the feedback from everyone on this thread. Going to have to think this one over.
