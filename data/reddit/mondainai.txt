Really? I think I have a higher standard for "best decisions" than 30%+ unemployment in Spain.
apropos: the banking system has a long (decades) time period - in effect, it won't be possible to know whether the EU made the right decisions until about 30 years time. It's too early to say right now - de facto, it made pretty much the same decisions to patch up the system as everybody else did (bear in mind, what you're seeing is multiple problems emerging in the banking system, not one), and the Euro's problem will continue to be, that it's Bretton Woods all over again, but without any ability to re-align currencies.

The central banks aren't printing money... (hint: it's the commercial banks - go check the stats.)

As a thought experiment, consider what happens if you open a fractional reserve based bank using bitcoin, instead of gold.
The gold standard period is a good example of a period with relatively fixed quantities of asset money, and significant instabilities in the monetary system. It is an unfounded simplifying assumption by economists that these kinds of systems exhibit that kind of stability - and there are multiple disproofs even with the simplified framework that this can't be the case.

No it developed out of accounting techniques. It would be most accurate to describe it as an emergent system.

So if productivity increases, you think prices should be maintained so that everybody pays more than they need to for goods?
You think entire countries (Spain) should be punished with massive unemployment, because there is now no way for their monetary system to adjust to external debt flows?
Start thinking about what you're reciting.

I think the correct answer, is why do you need to control it?
Markets are a distributed system - and that's there big advantage over centralised systems. In principle they don't require direct control - but we do need to be sure the framework surrounding (protocols if you like) result in the market based system producing as optimal as possible results.

Bitcoin in and of itself isn't a market. The market for bitcoin will behave like any other market - which means it's supposedly going to reflect supply and demand for bitcoin. That's the entire advantage of markets, they're a distributed price determination mechanism, and prices can vary.
Any market can be "controlled" by anybody who owns a sufficiently large proportion of the total amount of goods being sold on that market. But i suspect that wasn't quite what you meant...

The central banks set interest rates using their network position to enforce it - that wouldn't change.
It is simply not known how well monetary systems work without debt - but i have access to simulation results that suggest quite strongly that debt may be required for these systems to maintain a sustained flow. So we don't know what the long term results of a bit coin based economy would be, but I wouldn't make any assumptions myself about its sustainability, or about equilibrium. No country has experienced a constant money economy since the introduction of fractional reserve banking 3-400 years ago.

The big problem that led to the event was a debt fuelled stock exchange bubble. When the bubble burst, people who had borrowed to buy stocks weren't able to repay their debt, this caused the banks which had lent it to them to collapse, and that led to an approximately 20% contraction in the total money supply available (1929-32).
In a market based economy, prices of most things can adjust up or down to the supply of money, but one thing in particular can't - debt. So the contraction of the money supply, led to more debt default, which led to more banks collapsing.
The 1920's economy could have used bitcoin, and none of this would have changed. Bitcoin is just as good a basis for fractional reserve banking as any other currency.
There's really nothing special about bitcoin - it's just another form of money. See references on 19th century American wildcat banking if you want to know where this is all going.
