Have a think about how you don’t have a modem or direct lan connection to every website. Now remember you have different ways to connect to that website including your mobile provider and your home net. Same concept.
In fact think of it like when you load up your wallet to do stuff like buy beers or shop online and then transfer the rest back into a hardware wallet later, except that there’s no hurry (your money will return to savings eventually), no need to run multiple wallets for spending, and all payments are instant and 1 satoshi

Bitpay doesn’t actually transfer your coins to an exchange and sell them. It just sells some coins immediately at the time it receives yours, then moves them over to top up the balance. In that sense the “top up” of the exchange balance can happen via Lightning in small chunks. It’s actually ideal

Imagine if cash was taxed twice. Once when you got it and once when you spent it. Now imagine you could avoid all that if you used an overseas business. Sound stupid? It is
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:04:52
Yes LOTS.  To both. 
People in towns often have different and more up-to-date exchange rates on major currencies but can't send it to friends elsewhere.  They SMS credit as phone minutes to each other and trade those in credits in markets despite new mobile promotions coming out that vary the value of those credits. The markets have phone chargers in them because these act as banks. 
Foreign notes get dog-eared and no longer useful so they compare the quality of a note when accepting it. They call their friends in cities for accurate rates and 15% premium in rural areas is not uncommon. Foreign currency is often much harder to buy than sell. Local currency is handed over in BAGS for larger transactions, can take hours to count, and is riddled with counterfeit.
Cross-border currency exchange is sometimes illegal and carries with it ridiculous spreads/costs eg 50% difference to 'official' rates at informal money-changers. 
And there is absolutely NO way to buy anything on the internet as nobody has any way to pay. Big towns have internet cafes but nobody has a credit card.  So anything that has to come from overseas is ridiculously expensive

@_date: 2014-10-01 13:25:43
Calculate all the fees and you will find it's not actually cheaper than eg A BitRocket ATM.
 I got $398 of Bitcoin from Circle (quoted as $400) which came to $412 after CC fees. That's 3%. Then my Aussie bank took another 3% on to for conversion of USD to AUD. Some have a cash advance fee too.
So pay 6-7% via an American company or go hit an ATM for similar rates+

You call and ask for an EIN (employer identity number) which is a type of social security number. You can apply over the phone and 'to open a bank account' is a valid reason.

The official market for pesos has lower number of pesos per dollar than the black market. So if you go as a traveller and sell your US dollars you get a terrible rate unless you avoid official money changers. When you attempt to buy US dollars at the official rate you have to show an equivalent previous sell receipt and even then run into bogus problems such as "we're out of dollars today".

That would be ideal.  The trouble is shelters have neither the resources, nor skills, nor interest to do this kind of key management.  I think for boot-strapping it's acceptable to have a trusted person help with key management.  Yes I know that involves trust, but it wouldn't be good for crypto (or ultimately that person) if the money were stolen, so ripping off the homeless is probably bottom on the sociopath's list of evil plans.

To do anything reasonable with it you will need a bank account or several.  It's best to have several and to open them in as many places as you can manage.  This helps keep your transfer fees down, allows you options when one bank is faster or cheaper than another, and also gives you a fall-back in case of issues.
Localbitcoins is nice in principle, but you would have to charge a lot for your bitcoin at your ATM to make it work (i.e. more than localbitcoins obviously) - plus it's fiddly and tedious
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:14:33
You have a point but I think a lot of newcomers are likely to be interested and frankly what's a better way to start than to feed $20 into a machine and use it to buy your next coffee and meal (or beer or whatever)?

I agree. But what are costs like in Dominica? How many beers, meals, shoes or groceries can you get for $10?
@_date: 2014-08-23 05:01:52
Actually they will.  The guidance specifically mentions _exchanges_ - as well as 'brokers' (which is what Coinjar basically is).
Plus Coinjar is basically now going to be an overseas company, going from a big fish in a small pond to a small fish in a big pond.  Nobody outside Australia cares about Coinjar but now they will basically be servicing Australian businesses and paying UK tax.  Nice one ATO!
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:45:05
So 2% above the rate, but Coinjar charge a 2% fee on top of their quotes anyway.

Ok I just checked.  The Coinjar rate was A$530, the ATM is A$540.  BUT the Coinjar quote adds an extra 2% fee, on top which brings it to A$540.  So I'm pleased to announce we're matching Coinjar's rate, and for a short period, we'll beat it!

It's a great primer.  I'd probably stick to one analogy (apples or swords) myself, and someone needs an analogy that focusses on the fact that it's divisible.

TL;DR the capital gains rules are pretty sane... If the amount of bitcoin you are selling was originally worth less than $10k you don't have to worry, otherwise you pay tax just like with other investments.
The BAD part is the GST which is such a nightmare that bitcoin exchanges, ATMs and small businesses accepting bitcoin basically won't happen.  Those will look to overseas companies for their needs.

That's because with traditional banking you hand your money over to a bank for [safe keeping](  With Bitcoin, you are effectively acting as your bank - spending it is easy, it's getting some in the first place that is difficult. [The Wikipedia definition]( describes a Bitcoin ATM as "an electronic communications device that allows someone to buy bitcoins using cash without the need for a human to facilitate the transaction. Some models **also allow** the sale of bitcoins for cash."

Also the clauses about money being the debiting or credit of an account would apply (it's a distributed cloud ledger after all), but the ATO says an account is defined as being at an Australian Deposit Institution (ADI) ie unless it's a bank account it's not an account. Really?

Coinjar is not an exchange or even a wallet. It's a broker (electronic version of localbitcoins) who holds IOU tickets for bitcoin like Mt Gox did. Hopefully they are better but you don't hold your money yourself.

No consumers don't get to claim GST back. Not unless you are a business doing &gt;$75k turnover annually and the GST paid is directly related to business.
So when you use an ATM (or in this case a card) someone has to cover the 10% loss. I think CJ are doing it for a couple of months but won't be able to long term.
There are petitions if you care about this though.

CPAP machines (for obstructive sleep apnea) cost about $2.5k each but don't get listed on eBay because 'no medical equipment allowed'. They could go for as little as $500 and save some poor OSA sufferers some cash if eBay would loosen up...
OR what if an alternative existed...?
I have some top-notch malaria prevention tablets (Malarone) that cost $5 a day normally. About 30 days worth I didn't use because I changed a trip. I can't sell them even though they're not even remotely dangerous. The doctor's main question for them is: "can you afford a more expensive preventative medicine? If so there's a really safe one with virtually no side effects but it's under patent and costs too much for most people"
I can't even give them to the local chemist/drug store.

No, it's an attack where your coins are effectively double spent. You think the first transaction didn't succeed and try again, only to find both worked but with different transaction IDs.

So who in their right mind is going to buy their $9999 of CGT-free coin from an Australian source? Even a localbitcoins trader should be charging GST for more than a couple of such trades.
And most people won't want to send money overseas via wire and pay the 5% conversion fee etc when they could just buy shares.
Who is really going to go buy $500 worth of bitcoin face-to-face or overseas to buy coffee or replace their credit card?
For now bitcoin is dead in Australia. Yes it's great if you want to cash out via an overseas exchange and the amount you're cashing out was less than $10k when you bought it.
Who even has Gox receipts from back then? Please PM me since I need a pro forma to match against the buy orders in my spreadsheet
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:41:50
No fingerprints.  Rates equal to coinjar.  AML regulations don't require such things for other purchases e.g. gold, unless over $10k.  The machine won't be doing anything near $10k initially (more like $1k or $2k at a time), not til the back-end trading systems are working as intended.
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:50:47
What rules out the "Willy and Markus" bots being responsible?
If you wanted to get more than a hot wallet worth of Gox funds (all the cold wallets too) surely you would do it the way it appears the Willy bot did... eg you install the bot on the Gox server with bogus fiat amounts in its account and make it buy all the time, and withdraw those coins....
If MK then discovered that the bank balance was lower than what the database said, he probably started to delay saying so in an attempt to make the shortfall back eventually.
I'm not saying this is what happened, I'm just asking how we know there isn't hacking involved

Ah ok. I meant ATM operators need liquidity to convert eg Rupiah back into bitcoin to restock their machines. Often this involves a conversion via a bank into USD or EUR first before buying on an international exchange.

An exchange is where buyers and sellers place their order on a book (list) and when the two meet, a swap occurs.  This is different to a broker, which places your orders on an exchange and takes a cut.  Coinjar is a broker, you're paying for them to handle the exchange for you

To use a bank analogy, they were sometimes handing out a 100% extra with some BTC withdrawals. The customers who got that didn't complain.
Whenever the registers were empty some cash was hauled out of the vault, without doing the maths.
Finally they realised the vault was empty and pretended for a while it wasn't and people would deposit more. So they stopped withdrawals. But it didn't work and they are now bankrupt with lots of customers owning numbers in a database instead of money.

British papers have little boys who run between desks carrying scrolls with the copy of each article on it. As each desk edits it the little boys have to run back and forth and yell out the character positions and changes including carriage returns. Eventually after 8 days on the run for their toffee-nosed moronic buck-teeth masters with huge superiority complexes they collapse and their final gasp is 'please sir, digital'.
Eventually their overlords, bored of huge meetings that essentially circle jerk all day long, decided what a great idea it would be to make this all digital.  But just the same anyway. And for £70m over 5 years. They gaffawed and strutted around and stuck Digital at the start of their titles. 5 years later someone whispered 'CMS' and the cycle repeated.
True story, I've worked there.

Actually in that definition a financial supply is one where one account is debited and another credited. Despite the name 'bitcoin' and the use of the term 'wallets' bitcoin is exactly that: a debit and credit of numbered accounts in the bitcoin cloud.
This is pure bank lobbying and anyone who says otherwise is hiding their head in the sand. If bitcoin was a derivative or any other concocted financial products from a bank it would have no GST, plain and simple.
The UK is welcoming Bitcoin and offering the same treatment for the currency as for other foreign currencies. Yet again Australia has legislated itself out of a huge financial growth industry back towards farming and mining. Australia is its own worst enemy.

A bitcoin exchange doesn't just buy and sell bitcoin on behalf of customers (that would be a broker). It swaps someone's fiat for someone's bitcoin in an *exchange* and takes a small amount of either as profit. What it does with the profit has nothing to do with the value of the things it has exchanged, in fact Mt Gox had so much bitcoin it should've been outrageously rich. Something else happened to that wealth/profit along the way

Each host leases the machine and becomes an operator. Gets a share of commission depending on how much they pay.

My point is actually very simple. I'm not sure if you're serious but I'll answer. People are paying amounts like $5 and having the same transaction stuck for days. Making out that they're making a fuss is totally counterproductive to the dialogue about improving the network and preventing it from becoming irrelevant.

We're talking almost 20 BTC here.  There seem to be several options open here:
* Take up a lawyer in Hong Kong (where their company is)
* Complain to the bank(s) involved in any deposits you have made, they can theoretically reverse your deposit, and have done so in other cases
* Notify the police in the jurisdiction where you made the deposit
* Contact their social media presences (we have all tried this though to no avail)

No, all the businesses in that list with an ABN have to charge GST which means their customers won't want to buy from them. Buying from an Australian business upstream will actually make your costs higher.
Source: I work with many of the people who operate these businesses. They all need to import coin and avoid spending it here or fold up shop and say bye to Aus.
CJ just has the capital investment to pretend it's not happening for a few months while they squirm around legally and setup shop elsewhere. Sadly the rest of the world has few reasons to use CJ. I love CJ and wish this weren't happening but it's really really serious for all use of bitcoin as a currency in Aus. Terminal actually.

This is one of the most popularised, newsworthy and progressive uses of the bitcoin network in the past year or so, and you - and other small minded luddites are happy to dig your heels in to prevent bitcoin from becoming more relevant, more useful and more advanced over nothing but 3mb data - the equivalent of a photo - which is costing $7000 to "host" and won't even need to be included in pruned uTxo versions of the chain.

Yeah sorry man, a snappy reply made me wonder who I was dealing with. Sorry to snoop but there weren't _that_ many posts.
I had some Nigerian guy trying to convince me to sell bulk BTC to his "exchange" using credit cards (because the banks are "so difficult" there). It's like the first question people should ask themselves: what happens if the other end of the deal doesn't work?
Then again I've done work for clients without prepayment (usually fine but not always) and when you go into a restaurant I guess you're opening a credit tab while you eat and drink, so risk vs opportunity.

I know about these bots, mostly the same codebase but a few different piles of small private capital behind them.  It's there to create liquidity but within limits (through arbitrage against overseas exchanges mostly). With it running the prices will match overseas ones more closely.  It won't outbid you forever, you don't need to go to $5 cheaper than it, unless you really need to. Also it gets switched off while admin is done and/or code maintenance runs, and the main operator runs with a small float ie 15-30 BTC usually. You'll see the price difference against other international exchanges change in a leap when off.
Which city are you in? Sydney has a BitRocket machine that dispenses in Crystal St, Waterloo at BitPay rates. One is coming to Melbourne too.
Otherwise just set limit orders at staggered amounts/levels and forget about it.
Contact me if you want an automated way of doing so (a dumb bot so to speak), but the easiest is the limit order and patience.
Hope that's helpful :)

Exactly.  You don't need to have fancy flair to look at coin.dance or blockchain.info and see blocks are slow.
I don't feel like posting transactions publicly either but I can assure you, perfectly normal transactions are being missed when the hashrate *drops from 1 block every 10 minutes to one block every 60*.  I love bitcoin, I love SegWit but this is what appears to be happening.

Welcome Noob :)  The good news is this seems to have settled down, which is much better than the spooky alternative.  All the same I'd sit back with popcorn and at most - pick up some bargains for the next few weeks.  When you do so, move them out to a wallet ideally - unless the exchange says they will offer both forked and original coins, which is hard to do right now

Yeah I just spotted Antpool and some of the usual Chinese ones join back in.  They might have been switching to 1BTC nodes - as promised today and down for a couple hours.  I'm glad cos this could have been sinister!
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:24:32
Sure - and I think it has settled down again now finally - but this is a special time.  The start of a new difficulty period of two weeks, the day 1BTC software is supposedly deployed.  In two weeks BIP148 (ooo evil) will trigger if SegWit hasn't triggered in this time, but Segwit2X to the rescue (heh) - which is also compatible with having covert ASICBoost, and nice fast block block propagation times across your local fibre optic mining network
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:40:46
On Finex. Back in line with the others. It won't overshoot the others, in fact fresh money will go into Finex
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:26:56
It actually costs very little top "stop mining" - you turn stuff off, and your competitors still have to mine at the current block difficulty (set just hours ago).
So the _opportunity cost_ would be $5m to $20m roughly, which is a steal.  After that you have centralized mining in your super-fast local network and cheap electricity from the government.
I don't know why you resorted to rudeness, but if you follow through the game theory it makes sense, the block difficulty even adjusts on the day when voting counts for ASICBoosters (SegWit2X supporters, who don't want BIP148).

Update = the hashrate has fallen to 25% of what it was: 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:44:15
Because then the drama is over
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:31:15
Absolutely - but at the same time the difficulty dropping for exactly two weeks allows the voting rights after that to be close to worthless - i.e. SegWit2X with its ASICBoost compatibility and bigger blocks kick in.  It's so cunning, why didn't anyone think of it?  The dates even line up perfectly
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:54:10
If this is what it looks like, then it's quite a clever ploy.  Step _out_ of the network, let everything slow to a crawl for two weeks.  Block difficulty retargets after 2 weeks (ie 1 August, when the real battle begins).
Let SegWit activate ("_we_ didn't stop you") and then come back in once the block difficulty has adjusted and blow everyone away with your huge hashrate and extended voting rights

It's not a popular opinion but it's pretty good for now. I know some better, safer, options are coming. You can actually even withdraw Tether to your own wallet, it's based on Bitcoin Omnilayer

I think you'd blush if you knew how ridiculous that sounds and who you're saying it to. Do you always kick off like that?
To answer your point: contracts are immutable but a contract can easily refer to multiple versions and execute the currently deployed version. Yes, even on the public chain.

You mean in the sense of an unplanned impact instead of a mining mission?
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:32:33
It is a question. I do feel less references to the possible uses of the technology and just a string of links to bad publicity in the intro section make it biased:
" Unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser, not the vendor. The European Banking Authority[28]and other sources[14]:11 have warned that bitcoin users are not protected by refund rights or chargebacks.
The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators,[29]legislative bodies,[30] law enforcement,[31] and media.[32] They listed money laundering, financing of illicit activities, theft, fraud, tax evasion, and use in black markets as possible. As of 2013, the criminal activities centered around theft and black markets. "

Payoneer seem to offer prepaid card, but the way it's phrased is that ACH transfers from "companies like Paypal and Amazon" can be received... It's not at all clear whether this means **only** those companies, or **including** them.

I am not resident in the US and would like to get my USD out of Bitfloor.  Do any of these prepaid mastercards and the like allow you to make the ACH direct deposit to them?  How would they know whose account to credit, or does Bitfloor allow you to specify a message/reference with each ACH withdrawal?

It's complicated but you can get an IAFCU account.  Then again Roman seems to tell people he mailed a check to them when he blatantly didnt.
Here are the steps:
1) Get a US mail forwarding address and a number.  Google Voice does US numbers, but you have to trick it into thinking you're in the US (VPN?).  Your mail forwarding company may also require a certified (by a lawyer) form to forward official mail.
2) Call the IRS and ask them for an EID (employer ID) - which is a type of tax ID.  Use the reason "for opening a bank account" which is valid.  You can say you're starting a business, or possibly going to employ people.
3) Provide the address, phone number and EID (a type of TIN) to the IAFCU to open an account
4) Put this into Bitfloor and discover that Roman's actually a thief anyway
