This is a great point -- their value-add here is being the simplest and most user-friendly interface between traditional banking and the blockchain

Circle just basically announced the capability you're looking for:

Isn't that good? You converted something which is super volatile into something stable that you can hold without worrying that it will lose value? And now you can connect your bank account and withdraw USD for no fees and without worrying about the exchange rate, because you already have USD now.
Also they don't charge you anything to convert and there are no fees... and at any point, you can go into settings and switch your wallet denomination back to BTC, also for free? In fact, if your account had been denominated in BTC to begin with, you would have received it as BTC.
Not sure why you'd be angry.

I guess you didn't read the news today?
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:02:10
Wow. Did all their good engineers quit or something?

Wow you guys are really smart and great investors.
I'm also a smart Canadian like you guys. Because I'm a wise macro investor I decided to move all my savings out of CAD into this US biotech stock called KBIO. Now because I was smart enough to foresee that a Canadian economy overly reliant on the commodity and real estate sectors would suffer from a stronger USD, I'm up +765% instead of down -17%.
No hotel booking sites will accept my KBIO shares, but I just sell them for USD on etrade and then use the USD to book my hotels! Kind of like what you guys do with BTC via Bitpay/Coinbase!
Smart Canadian investors unite!

Or maybe it's because you keep losing banking partners every few weeks and now customers are getting confused about which of your bank accounts they should wire to?

Hahahahah oh man. This reads like a college freshman who just finished finance theory 101 and decided to vomit a bunch of technical terms together. So OP, let me clue you in a little bit.
Tip  Theta on an infinite option is 0. It's not infinity. There's no time decay.

did you decide you're no longer "NOT A WALLET" anymore? Cause as far as I know there aren't any regulated US exchanges that allow their traders to fund trades via debit cards.

Calling someone a "pain in the ass" on reddit is exactly how I would want the Director of Engineering of my $500mm company to behave in public

awesome, I'm glad I could help!

circle.com or coinbase.com
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:28:41
There definitely are... circle.com, CEX, others. These are onramps though, not exchanges.
On the other hand Brian explicitly said they don't want to service wallet customers anymore and instead are becoming a super-serious "regulated exchange": 
@_date: 2016-01-05 07:38:35
yeah it actually works great for me. If you have a debit card you can get the BTC instant. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:25:17
Actually still don't understand why people use Coinbase to buy BTC either. 1% transaction fees to buy and sell BTC in this day and age is pretty ridiculous. There are plenty of much lower cost and just as credible (i.e. VC backed) alternatives.
