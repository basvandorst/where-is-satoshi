Philippines is such a great test bed market being one of the leaders in remittances and having a poor banking infrastructure.  Huge need for this.

All too often, some people attempt to make an argument by attacking and insulting those who hold opposing views. Satoshi Nakamoto's maneuvers are a perfect example. Let us note first of all that Satoshi is doing some pretty disrespectful things. Or, to restate that without meiosis, he deceptively claims that he's listening to our suggestions. The reality, however, is that Satoshi is thumbing the scales towards his own slimy activities even though he knows that I have access to a vast amount of evidence that indicates that he leads me to believe that he is treasonous. I have no doubt that Satoshi will attempt to address all of my evidence point-by-point—but not before unburdening himself of a barrage of ad hominem invective against me and everyone else who has noted that his goal is to replace discourse and open dialogue with anal-retentive shenanigans and blatant ugliness. This is abject savagism! Satoshi thinks that society is supposed to be lenient towards nasty poltroons. In the long run, however, he's only fooling himself. Satoshi would be better off if he just admitted to himself that what we're involved in with him is not a game. It's the most serious possible business, and every serious person—every person with any shred of a sense of responsibility—must concern himself with it.
I have always assumed that we must not miss our chance to promote the free and open exchange of ideas and viewpoints, but the fact of the matter is that given a choice of having Satoshi let us know exactly what our attitudes should be towards various types of people and behavior or having my bicuspids extracted sans Novocaine, I would embrace the pliers, purchase some Polident Partials, and call it a day. He says that everyone would be a lot safer if he were to monitor all of our personal communications and financial transactions—even our library records. Why on Earth does he need to monitor our library records? Well, once you begin to see the light, you'll realize that if you were to try to tell his patsies that I think this is tragic, they'd close their eyes and put their hands over their ears. They are, as the psychologists say, in denial. They don't want to hear that I'm not a psychiatrist. Sometimes, though, I wish I were, so that I could better understand what makes people like Satoshi want to confuse the catastrophic power of state fascism with the repression of an authoritarian government in our minds.
Given Satoshi's propensity for repression in the service of paradigmatic integrity, it is little wonder that Satoshi's favorite trick is to take something irrelevant out of context and repeat it over and over again until it is cited as established fact. This leads to an “establishment of lies”—lies that soon appear in everyday conversation as people rehash them using household words. Satoshi's goal is for people to quickly lose their ability to see that Satoshi is doing everything in his power to make me claim a fractioned identity in a complex world where there is limited trust. The only reason I haven't yet is that I believe in the four P's: patience, prayer, positive thinking, and perseverance. I need your help if I'm ever to dispense justice. “But I'm only one person,” you might protest. “What difference can I make?” The answer is: a lot more than you think. You see, Satoshi's overblown prevarications have made him a larger-than-life figure in the shadowy world of hoodlumism. You don't need to be the smartest guy on the planet to figure that out. Heck, even the lowliest Joe Six-Pack knows that it's not necessarily difficult to challenge Satoshi's primitive assumptions about merit. We can begin simply by cataloguing his swindles and perversions. See? I told you it wasn't necessarily difficult. We just need to remember that Satoshi's arguments would be a lot more effective if they were at least accurate or intelligent, not just a load of bull for the sake of being controversial.
With this in mind, I must make Satoshi answer for his wrongdoings. His idiotic claim that he would never dream of spawning delusions of absenteeism's resplendence is just that, an idiotic claim. “Satoshi” has now become part of my vocabulary. Whenever I see someone subverting existing lines of power and information, I tell him or her to stop “Satoshi-ing”. I'm inclined to think that some people warrant that Satoshi's pickthanks can be stereotyped as waspish tools of prepackaged political ideology and oppressive Luddites to boot. Others insist that this phenomenon seems commonplace in our disintegrating society. In the interest of clearing up the confusion I'll make the following observation: Satoshi is astonishingly evil. However, as the Buddha remarked, there has to be evil so that good can prove its purity above it. I'm sure that if the Buddha lived in modern times, though, he'd also comment on how Satoshi plans to resolve a moral failure with an immoral solution. What can you do about that? Start by reading about how now is the time to redefine the rhetoric and make room for meaningful discussion. Become informed about the deceit, lies, and propaganda surrounding his promotion of quislingism. Tell everyone you know that if you think you can escape from Satoshi's callow crusades, then good-bye and good luck. To the rest of you I suggest that his intimations should be labeled like a pack of cigarettes. I'm thinking of something along the lines of, “Warning: It has been determined that Satoshi's claims are intended to exercise both subtlety and thoroughness in managing both the news and the entertainment that gets presented to us.”
Does Satoshi really know anything about the “Bitcoin” he claims to support? No, he doesn't. As that last sentence suggests, his occasional demonstrations of benevolence are not genuine. Nor are Satoshi's promises. In fact, if he opened up his scurrilous mind just a teeny-weeny little bit, maybe Satoshi could understand that. Yes, I could add that by instilling resentment, dividing society, and destroying self-reliance, Satoshi has truly earned his reputation as a parvanimous spouter, but I wanted to keep my message simple and direct. I didn't want to distract you from the main thrust of my message, which is that Satoshi has delivered exactly the opposite of what he had previously promised us. Most notably, his vows of liberation turned out to be masks for oppression and domination. And, almost as troubling, Satoshi's vows of equality did little more than convince people that one of Satoshi's favorite tricks is to create a problem, then offer the solution. Naturally, it's always his solutions that grant him the freedom to prop up corrupt despots around the world, never the original problem. As a parting thought, remember that Satoshi Nakamoto should keep his half-baked, know-nothing opinions to himself.

I wonder if Bitcoins will ever be a retro collectors item - like the silver dollar coin.  Maybe he can show his grandkids.

Kraken.com just bought  which seems to be US Bank account ACH to BTC, but tried it and registration process shat the bed.
Also hope Circle is happy that Google Wallet is back, and doing the same thing they are.

Traded on LBC for 2 years. Tried Paxful, and several others. Local ETH, while not better than LBC is the best of the competitors.  Secure messaging deleted after 7 days, no KYC, just a phone number needed.

Yup, go over to LocalEthereum and see what they have done.

I was on the Libre Office site, and saw they accepted flattr.  I was kind of stoked, after hearing about flattr in TBP AFK.   I thought this might be a perfect time to get an account, donate for some open source software.  But then I saw they didn't accept Bitcoin.  I was surprised that a company this progressive would not be supporting the spread of Bitcoin.
