(Offtopic, but still something I want to ask you guys):
Why do I only need one form of ID on coinbase but two on Gdax? Same standard limit on both. EU customer.
Actually passed my driving test 10 weeks ago but they haven't managed to send me the ID yet :|
Also, the deadline has been advanced like 2 times, kinda strange.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:11:06
I've read the sign in messages, but well, I didn't get any email. Not a problem for me as I had read the notice on the website. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 06:04:15
Yet I never once got an email about this. Oops. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:27:36
If you are only trading on gdax then it's still great in the EU. No deposit fee and only 15 cents withdrawal. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:44:12
if you include more than 3 usernames it won't make a notice at all, iirc. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:22:11
On some exchanges, in the KYC/AML process you have to declare if you are a PEP (politically exposed person) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:14:24
Ask the bank?
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:46:35
For some reason miner fees are still free from gdax. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:35:20
No shit, but you have no clue when the leave should be at
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:08:49
Bitcoin.de isn't a real exchange though, sadly. They only connect people and make an esvrow, so to say. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:03:15
They closed registration, iirc, or at least it's the lowest priority right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:26:42
Lmao what an innocent world view
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:30:33
I did. Initiated on (I think) 20.12 and received on 28.12. Took so long because of 4 Bank holidays. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:27:34
Huh? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:34:02
It's bullshit, why would it be tax-free? If someone makes money it should be taxed most of the time. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:11:08
Use uBlock, better performance-wise and doesn't have acceptable ads crap
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:12:01
@_date: 2014-01-10 11:27:40






There's some relevant xkcd to this.
@_date: 2014-01-11 09:23:13
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:44:29
A top 100 search. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 09:04:30
I'll try to find it
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:37:07
Damn, I guess I now understand why reddit in general hates religions... In germany/Spain there aren't religious billboards etc
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:24:47
a dev from them replied to one of the threads...
@_date: 2015-05-10 11:38:06
100TB disks are not going to be available in 5 years. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:11:15
Greenaddress, works great for me. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:40:25
The of title mentioned how much 5BTC are valued at. Hint: 1500 USD. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:36:35
Hey, discourse is an open-source/FLOSS project and feedback is always welcome at  . 
Why do you find its horrible to find information on? 
@_date: 2015-05-16 15:48:39
For starters, 




Further, they only have Amazon US gift cards, and no amazon.de/es/etc ones.
@_date: 2016-03-27 08:17:48
And you can sleeve computer/usb cables with it. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:56:33
Interesting, might look at it over this weekend. Planning on doing a vacation with my gf in the Bavarian forests over New years. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:32:10
Withdrawing btc is no problem though, not sure why that would be an issue
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:09:45
Yeah, it would have been a week. Aw, sad :/
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:33:36
Thousands of times per day, lol, and you are asking us for info? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:24:43
Withdrew my Btc from gdax for no fees at all a week ago. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:29:35
South Korea? :P
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:25:10
No, there isn't, although you could do the recurring buys via the API gdax provides of course, just the finding has to be done separately. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 13:57:53
Ha, this is great! I live in Spain and this is pretty nice. Just need to wait some weeks to turn 18 apparently...
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:10:05
You still get a worse exchange rate and a fee buying directly on coinbase compared to gdax. Doesn't matter much if you think Btc will grow a LOT, I can see that. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:40:02
Is there a way to buy bitcoins at these Spanish atm's too? I only saw an option to we'll at the website. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 11:34:56
You are saying he only changed one word? Did you even watch both videos? He kept the music and a few scenes and the typography, but a lot of scenes were exchanged. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:10:12
No. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:06:38
Yet sites don't require as much total confirmation time on the litecoin chain? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:57:31
Are you talking about litecoin perhaps? Bitcoin takes effectively 30-60minutes.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:54:13
You are right, but sites do not use equal "security time" on different currencies. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:36:48
But most sites require 3 to 6 confirmations, and if you have bad luck it takes more than those 30 ideal minutes. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:56:45
Jesus Christ, your Text reads like you are 12.
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:11:46
Please directly reply to the comments or use to ping them.  doesn't do anything on reddit. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:58:03
Likely the fault of Worldpay (their processor) then. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 17:57:29
So he doesn't get ddosed again. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:07:02
Also, not sure why you try to insult me :) 
@_date: 2015-09-27 08:50:19
Yeah I wanted to say that, thanks for elaborating :) 
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:33:41
So, necessary in many countries? 
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:28:42
Generally, information is under Urheberrecht when there was some creativity or artistic something involved, afaik. 
WBS Law videos on this (german) are very informative. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 17:14:38
Low-effort jokes and comic, nothing to do with bitcoin. And sitting at a 720 score. Sigh. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 23:17:05
Thanks, wanted to post this too. 
Discourse is **the** upcoming forum software, others are simply trash compared to it. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:16:30
IIRC that app is FLOSS. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 00:25:13
They ship worldwide. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 13:32:36
So I've tried to verify via the phone app, but I got no sound from the two times (with two different employees) I tried to verify. I said my name and held the ID up but the verification was cancelled.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:28:32
Haha interesting man, I work at kaufland's IT in germany and never heard of bitcoin around here so I was curious :) Greetings! 
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:45:45
he wanted to hint that you spelt gent wrong
Edit: Jesus I meant genital
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:06:03
1 kiss to your dog/s  :)  @_date: 2017-07-24 23:04:06
Just something that interests me, can you do that in a Kaufland too? 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:19:17
Apparently he was rewarded 0.5 btc.
@_date: 2016-07-27 14:31:22
Why? Haven't had an issue with them yet (except for a little thing... Not important). They got very little fees and the sepa transfer was done in 1 day. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:24:54
On the other thread people said it's basically the equivalent of "John Smith", so eh, dumb to look stuff like this up
@_date: 2016-07-26 13:20:41
 here's a screenshot from mine. Deposited 75€ yesterday and bought btc today. Now I can only deposit it seems? Pretty dumb, I wrote support and am waiting now
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:26:56
600$ and 700$ gotcha
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:07:16
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:35:09
Just put the names etc on some info page on your website... WHy make your possible customers make look via whois?
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:38:24
You set an order and well, you wait until it gets fulfilled completely.
If it only gets fulfilled partly, well then the rest of the order is still active.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:10:22
He answered on my comment on the same issue!
