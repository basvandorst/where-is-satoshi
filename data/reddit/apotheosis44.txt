You know the bankers and pharisees were Jews right, and most of the bible is him warning everyone about their inherent evil.

I can buy anything with it, without changing it into fiat already. I just have to look for vendors that offer it, and the number of people doing this increases daily. I even see ATM's here and there in major cities so obviously its becoming a thing, thats on the same level as seeing Mcdonalds slowly crop up on every street corner.

Dude a live in a small town out in the country and people were talking about it at the barbershop a couple weeks ago. Old people. These huge influxs of money arent based in speculation. What we're witnessing is the spread of its adoption, and if its going to follow the same adoption curve as any other groundbreaking technology its going to be a straight vertical till 75-80% have invested in it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:26:35
Incorrect. Theres 860 cryptos on the market. Many experience spikes of 200% in timeframes in as little as days. You could easily amplify 300 bucks into a million in a few months bouncing it around the cheaper currencies. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:33:47
So whats the end game to all of this? Are they trying to crash cryptos as a whole?
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:28:25
We'll see. Im throwing a grand in once I got my entire home system reformated and locked down. I find the majority of spikes in value usually have really obvious causes. For example, Im willing to beat ether is going to hit 425 in the next couple weeks. Probably faster, because windows and a couple other big corporations started to back it publically a few hours ago. Litecoins massive spike was caused by segwit adoption. This isnt attempting to predict a products adoption with the masses or trying to divine a companies performance. This is the free for all phase of a new form of currency, and engagement is about to grow massively.

Dont invest with emotion falls right into that catagory. It should also be noted that cryptos are a completely different form of investment than investing in something like a company, and theres design considerations you have to seriously take into account. Bitcoin for example is turning into a slug due to the limitations of its blockchain design, and the number of transactions and people adopting it are still relatively low, compared to a currency like the USD. Its not much of a stretch to think other, better designed cryptos will easily overshadow bitcoin in the future as its speed gets crippled by the growth in volume. Theres also differences, vast difference in that its a blockchain. It doesnt have any over head. If it crashes its not in danger of being chopped into pieces and its employees evaporating overnight. It could crash to 0 (impossible because its not a company)  for years and have life breathed back into it through renewed trading. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:10:59
The question is how long will it take for you? Without any real functionality for day to day transactions, bitcoin will slowly lose relevancy as other, better designed coins take the lead, and all the wealth thats currently stored in it will seep down to a shadow of what it once was. Its just a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:40:20
Cryptos are going to match or beat out Gold assests in terms of stored wealth in a few years. Mark my words.

Finally, a voice of reason. Its refreshing to not instantly be assaulted for voicing something.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:30:47
It wont, theres too many things wrong with it for operation at that scale. Bitcoin is the very first, THE FUCKING FIRST iteration of blockchain. Do you really think its going to win out in the longrun? Really.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:11:10
It doesnt stop at the net either amigo. Obama legalized propaganda and dishonesty for all media networks back in 2012.  One can only wonder at what kind of horrors we would've been subjected to had madam Satan been elected rather then the orange buffoon. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:36:23
And nothing about increasing blocksize so more transactions are possible. Prepare your anus for a resounding failure in the near future as everyone scurries off to bitcoin cash.

Nobody would've been that disciplined anyways and held them past a $80. Im sure theres a few leviathans out there that held up until now but theyre rare as fuck.

 Why must you think in such a pathetically one dimensional manner? Bakers arent in control of political discourse and public perception. So with that in mind, its imperative that the internet remains open and free in order for the First amendment to stay relevant, because you might as well be saying you're ok with a baker deciding what you can and cant speak about to your friends. The only way to prevent this type of subversion is to dismember, and completely kill the corporations that are attempting to control cyberspace. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:42:08
Aggravating people wasnt my intent, but I think you're fully aggravated, and you're aggravated because you know its a stupid move on bitcoin's part to not increase blocksize. Hows it feel knowing youre supporting a dying coin? (now Im trolling)
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:44:20
What you can see is already controlled, dissenting opinions are silenced, and your every move is tracked monitored and watched and every piece of info you possess is also collected analyzed and sold. Seems to me like Net neutrality is only neutral in title.

Let the ISP's control who gets bandwidth and who doesnt, its great for America! While we're at it we can sell the roads and water infrastructure to apple and microsoft! It'll be awesome, the free market can compete and everything will get better! (wish I had an upvote farm to boost a 150 likes on my comment too)

If you have a large amount (over 10k) its possible theyre having to report your savings to the government and verify them and whatnot so they stay legit.

I cant imagine what it feels like to lose that much money. You'll get over it eventually though. Its just money. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:50:54
more like pull them out of the system completely and swap for something else while absolutely every single coin continues to plummet. THEN buy back in at a later date.

You're obviously a little challenged when it comes to reading comprehension, but its ok, my mother always told me to be patient with the disabled. What I meant by that is things are only gonna change once a lot of people die, which really isnt revolution, and Im not even sure if the change would be good.

What about the childporn thats been spammed onto the chain. It seems like quite a dangerous situation for BTC overall, as you're forced to interact with it to use it in any capacity. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:16:44
Me too, its made me financially literate and has placed me in a investment mindset rather then being a simple consumer. Its radically changed the way I perceive the world.

Just slap an 6 axis gyro on there, throw it on a trampoline with a bunch of kids and use it to graph the markets. Itll probably be fairly accurate.

Inflation is caused by the printing off of more paper notes. Thats literally its only cause. Its not a natural feature of an economy.

It seems like a lot but those machined parts are easy to produce, including the machines that machine them. Melt some scrap down into a billet, load it up, press a button. Boom, you got a functional engine block, pistons, headers. Its just the glam behind the whole process that dazzles people and convinces them its extremely difficult.

Its not going to change, it will continue growing more and more tyrannical until it savages its own population. Then, once a lot of people are dead, then it'll change.

Everyone still holding out on another upswing is wasting their time waiting. Its not going to happen, the crypto party is over. (for now)

Mtgox was the reason I avoided getting in for so long. I was about to right around the time they took off with everyones coins, it wasnt until Ether hit about 80 that I started kind of paying attention again. Thought it might explode just by name alone. Checked back a few months later. HOLY FUCK. Im in.

Look at me with my infinite printing capabilities. Surely this will never be abused. Right?
