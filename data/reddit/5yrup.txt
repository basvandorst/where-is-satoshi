You mean Trump when he runs as an independent?

Two guys are getting car loans. One guy makes $30k a year and wants to take out $20k for a car loan. The other guy makes $500k a year and takes out $90k for a car loan. Sure, that $90k is nominally much higher, but which one is more likely to experience problems paying back the loan?
You can't just look at the nominal, unadjusted dollar value to make any decent comparison of debt. There are a lot of other things to look at, such as adjusting for inflation, debt to income ratio, etc.

So other than economics professors and bankers, who else would you prefer to run the Fed? Stay at home moms? Plumbers? Welders? Cable install techs? Bakers? Who else is qualified in your mind?I'd imagine economists and bankers would be the best people for the job, as they probably have the most knowledge of how the system works. Even if those posts had direct elections (which I don't think would happen, it would be terrible) I'd vote for economists and bankers every time.

Its much smoother when scrolling or zooming/panning in most apps. Loading speeds aren't usually faster, as that's mostly a limitation of the flash memory which isn't that fast on a phone. That's a pretty firm physical limitation. Just takes time to take something from the memory card and put it into the RAM.

It's (possibly) different in China. The Chinese government does not have to re-lease the land to you just because you've had a lease previously, even if you've been making all your lease payments. If the US or state government wants to kick me off land I've been paying property taxes on, I need to be compensated for the government taking.
We don't really know what re-lease rates will be in China for those 70 year leases.

I'm not talking about a failure to pay property taxes or lease payments. I'm assuming you've been paying your due all along.
In the US, if they want the land they need to compensate you to take it from you if you've been paying your taxes. In China, your "deed" *will* expire and you will have no legal claim to that land on a pre-determined date. Also, you never have any true claims to the land, you're simply borrowing it from the people of China, so the government has the right to remove you from it at any time. Many of these big property leases were 70 year leases which are soon to expire, so there's a lot of focus on what China will do when it comes time for lease renewals. If the government chooses to not renew the lease for the land where you've just built a multi-million dollar condo tower, you're just fucked.

A friend of mine has a few BFL's and is thinking of buying more. The only negative he experienced was cheap power supplies.

Hmm, I'll probably crack a few open with my friend and apply some of the good ol' silver. Thanks for the tip!

It's not like they're arguing every BTC is in the hands of terrorists, they're probably suggesting the transactions are making it easier to fund cells around the world. So, the number you should look to would be volume, not market cap. Buy BTC with dollars from selling oil, transfer it to Europe as BTC, sell to get Euros. I doubt terrorist groups are holding that much BTC.

For my checking account I've made money. While not much, my checking account comes with a small amount of interest. Coupled with no ATM fees or any other fees I've encountered, I've never spent a penny on any of my USAA accounts.They still value my money deposited in there because they take it and invest it to make more money. Sure, they're gambling with my cash, but in the end I don't care as its FDIC insured and my bank (USAA) hasn't had any issues.Sure the money in my checking account hasn't gained as much interest as holding silver the past few years, but a checking account isn't for savings. You would have to be a fool to leave money in USD for long term investing or saving. Checking accounts are for just that...debit and checking transactions. Simply a holding pot where income goes to be distributed other places later.

If you really wanted to, you could set up your iptables to route HTTP/HTTPS/etc through the VPN tunnel, and everything else (i.e. games) through the regular Ethernet adapter.

Learn how fractional reserve banking works. They gather a lot of capital (balances in checking accounts), hold a certain percentage, and invest the rest. They make money from the investments they do, not so much the fees. At least the good banks do, I can't speak for all banks.

I fail to see what you're getting at. From the looks of most trading websites, it appears that most BTC are held by Americans...wouldn't the overall wealth of America increase with the skyrocketing price of BTC?
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'd just like to see your entire frame of reference to make these claims.

Accountants and auditors will continue to exist, for sure. Their jobs would change, but they'll be around as long as businesses exist. Companies need to know how their money is moving, regardless of if its a government issued currency, Bitcoins, or whatever other means of wealth transportation exists in the future.
