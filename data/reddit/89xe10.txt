There's are a few good reasons that bitcoin investors are laughed at, one of them being that people that have never invested in *anything* before in their entire lives going 'all in' on it due to FOMO or sheer optimism. People don't go 'all in' on investments. You should not treat bitcoin as if it were poker.
The best advice has been mentioned; never invest more than you can afford to lose. If you lost all your btc savings tomorrow; if it would stop you from being able to eat, pay rent, etc, then yes you've made a very irresponsible decision.
Back to the poker analogy. Every single person that took a loan out to go 'all in' on bitcoin; whether they made millions from that decision or not, made a bad decision and lucked out with it. You can go all in on an off-suit 7 &amp; 2 and still win, but it doesn't mean it was a rational decision.

Sometime between right now and never. Probably about ten mins.
