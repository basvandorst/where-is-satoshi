Hey man good luck to you maybe you should invest some more if bitcoin does hit 20k maybe you'll have some excess. 
Ps what the hell are you going to do &amp; for how long that it's going to cost you 20k (assuming you have 1 btc)

A bitcoin ATM. I've known about bitcoin was interested but never pulled the trigger until I walked into my local gas station. That's when it left the digital realm and became real to me I pulled the trigger and bought some that night. (Not at the ATM forget those fees)

I think it would be cool if next to the price of the coin it would show how many you would need to have to be an actual millionaire.
BTC = 5,000 = 200 coins 
BTC = 7,000 = ~183 coins
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:35:31
People bet the price of bitcoin would go up but it went down.

Phase 1
Put your coins in safe place and wait a year till this all blows over.
Phase 2
Phase 3

I didn’t know it was invite only I heard about it when it came out was able to download it. It asked me to sync other wallets which I thought was weird and declined. Then it seemed buggy when I tried to create a wallet it didn’t populate an address. So I deleted it after that. 
Talking about spedn btw
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:58:31
I plugged mine in recently &amp; it required a firmware update to work with the new ledger live software.
They discontinued work on the google chrome application.
The coins will be there but it may not work with the latest software.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:10:51
If you have already purchased your Bitcoin on coinbase how do you then transfer it to a paper wallet.
