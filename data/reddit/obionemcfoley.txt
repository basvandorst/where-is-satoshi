I’d be curious to know your opinion once you’ve taken a loot. It definitely has my interest but I’m not overly familiar with what they’re trying to do, so I’d appreciate someone else giving it a look

This is why I’m so interested in the Nimiq project. An entirely browser-based blockchain with ease of us in mind.

It’s called Dropil (dropil.com). From what I gather, retirement fund management is coming in future updates but their trading bot is already functional. I signed up for their ICO but haven’t fully decided if I want to go in on it yet. They’re still working on the legal framework but have lawyers setting everything up according to an email a couple days ago. It’s interesting they’re actually trying to be compliant in the US.

There’s a trading bot/crypto retirement fund that’s about to be in ICO phase right now and they to be legal in the US. Not sure how those hoops are going to work, would be interesting to see these things start to pop up. Standard retirement funds aren’t enough anymore, maybe crypto can help bridge the gap.

Just as a note to anyone new to bitcoin/crypto who is reading this: you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin. I thought that for the longest time and it kept me from investing. You can buy $5 worth of bitcoin if you want.
