i'm very sorry about your situation. i didn't do my video as a mockery of money; that wasn't my intent. it may be misconstrued, but i did it to make a point with what i had at my disposal. i hope things become better in spain. i return to argentina in 3 weeks, where i live, and i'm pretty concerned it's all going to come crashing down as soon as i get home.

let's hold internet hands and hope our new Nexus 5's arrive!
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:42:24
it was a self-post, so no karma.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:58:28
i valued that phone a lot, and although it got destroyed, i'll give it to a friend to see if he can salvage any useful parts from it. that way it gives back to the system. it was a statement, and i'm already getting hateful PMs about it. again, it was just a personal choice. it hurt me to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:09:21
a couple of press inquiries (probably to ridicule me), a new Nexus 5 arriving tomorrow (God willing), and some internet fun has made this nothing but fun. well worth the ride!
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:49:33
my iphone was one i purchased off of craigslist for $250, so the nexus 5's price tag of $400 make it a win.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:06:00
i don't have solid decision-making skills at 3am...
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:48:19
haha, your reaction makes it all good. use it sparingly and with much schadenfeel. (i could go on and on...)
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:38:11
i disagree, so does that mean i upvote? i'm so confused. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:11:29
[Ladies and gents, I say goodbye to my iphone 5 32gb.](
[edit] [came through]( have at it, folks!
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:28:45
I haven't told her yet! I'll video it for everyone to see her reaction if/when I get the Nexus 5.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:11:18
i agree.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:12:43
use your wife's phone like i did. unless you don't have a wife. :(
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:37:24
i feel like i dodged a bullet or something here. have schadenfun!
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:53:25
what rate are you offering?
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:22:54
He said the first 5.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:27:52
thank you!

Oh I love Argentina! Just here visiting family. I head home in a few weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:27:35
I'd rather not, but it's been a blast.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:32:44
can you send me a link of your local news station? love to see it.
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:39:06
how does this work, because it looks awesome, but i'm not receiving anything! :(
thanks, though.
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:55:47
i feel ***REALLY*** bad for the inevitable 
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:36:55
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:28:43
i have! i'm .tec/castlead
haven't played in ages, though.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:23:05
i was racked by hesitation. thank you for your kind words.
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:50:25
awesome! i think everyone got their reward.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:27:58
currently in the US. :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:39:48
this was done by all of us in about 3 hours total from OP posting the challenge. difficult to come up with a convincing mock product while following all guidelines and maintaining continuity.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:35:38
I was terrified, but fortune rewards the bold.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:24:27
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:39:49
crossing claws!
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:39:27
ya think so?
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:28:02
Glad you enjoyed it!
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:02:41
I'll do it if you PM me your name, address and number i can text you at right now. or at least a number and a name.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:24:01
i wanted to be the first! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:19:20
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:32:59
i'm not rich, i'm a missionary in south america. i did this for a few reasons, but certainly not because i have $500 phones crawling out of my assuming i did.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:51:36
i agree, mine was the most vanilla of the 5. my competition was a freakin machete weilding neck-beard and a sniper!!! haha
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:23:43
we'll see. thanks for your positive outlook!
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:55:44
i was doing this at 2:30am and didn't want to wake my family. sorry. i'll see if i can add some captions or something.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:33:12
thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:32:14
it fell out of my pocket onto a sharp rock 4 times. it was intense.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:28:08
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:52:11
i began exchanging PMs with him/her and felt comfortable sending my email to have him/her verify that way. once we established some dialogue via email i decided to give it a wack. i did this and as i was uploading it, (s)he sent me proof of the escrow and it was just a matter of hashing out shipping details and wrapping up the arrangement.
someone had to be first, and i was in the right place to do it. i'm a risk-taker, and although i've paid for it in the past, this time the risk paid me back in a good way.
it was an internet adventure!
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:44:22
volcom. i blacked it out, though since i'm not a sk8r. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:06:10
it really comes down to trust...which is pretty ephemeral on the internet anyway. name and number with a photo. i respect privacy, but you have to risk it being made public if you don't follow through. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:46:47
I WON'T!
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:24:03
that would make this poor shibe very happy.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:39:57
glad to see you're still here. it was fun to do!
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:29:54
Yup! Came 6 days after this whole shenanigan.
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:40:56
awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:46:09
i'm super happy actually. i have a great life!
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:05:46
i'm not crying. nor did i cry when i smashed my iphone. it was a statement i was prepared to make. stand up for something, haviq.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:45:38
when it goes world-wide like UK, germany , argentina, and domestic online sites like wired.com and 8 others, it means it was actually effective.
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:25:47
got it today. :) i posted a thank you post in @_date: 2014-02-13 07:40:21
le pongo a todos mis celulares en los bolsillos por las dudas.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:36:51
i'm sad that although i was the first i didn't make it on the video of the videos. :(
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:43:37
well that's a bummer. that's the most doge i've ever gotten.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:36:33
personal choice. 
[edit] don't downvote him, ppl. it's his/her opinion.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:18:57
long live the king.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:58:21
i'll be home to check my mailbox in a few hours and report back! good for you...and good for us.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:42:49
i tell you, it was hard to do. you can see my hesitation in the video a bit. i always like to mention to people that today's smartphones are more powerful than the system that got us to the moon. that's incredible.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:41:35
mine was a $250 used, old iphone 5. it's time was up.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:40:42
i had a back up phone. always have a back up phone.
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:36:39
not for the 32g version. with shipping it was about $20 more. i told him that, too.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:29:17
mine was old and busted, and i was offered a new shiny. old and busted...or new shiny.
i'll take new shiny.
