I updated my Robinhood app and now it's all messed up?
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:49:04
I said the supply, there will always be new ways and places to obtain it.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:45:57
Anything can go to zero.
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:54:33
Once our universe collapses another gold producing universe will pop up, not finite.
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:26:41
The supply of gold isn't finite.
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:57:20
Man can't "create" more yet but precious metals are forged in the cataclysmic collisions of neutron stars and then flung out into the universe where they eventually aggregate with other stardust into larger bodies, like planets or comets. NOT finite.
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:40:40
Uh, no it's not.
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:14:12
I've watched this movie 5 times now and I missed that, hilarious!
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:17:02
They were waiting for you to buy. Next time let us know first so we can all get our sell orders ready too.

For starters it's BTC. [
@_date: 2019-03-10 15:58:14
Why only One Million?
@_date: 2019-03-31 17:12:18
If someone threw away or lost any asset it's not anyone else's problem. If they didn't have some kind of insurance to cover the loss it's gone FOREVER. From your post it seems you're thinking maybe there's a back channel to get peoples lost coins back to them, not going to happen.
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:13:42
5mo to halving. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:12:41
I first bought 6 years ago but a lot of people I know started buying a year ago with encouragement from me. Now I'm the bad guy...
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:01:35
I agree, it's still in its infancy. So many are crying now because they bought high but it's going to be so much more.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:29:02
I'm more interested if they did commit the fraud if anyone will seek damages or just roll over and take it like weak dumb bitches?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:23:59
I first bought 6 years ago so I'm good. This shit makes the whole industry look like a scam, you seem to think that's fine...sad.

The next BTC mining snap will be May 20th 2020!
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:57:19
I think he means he watched the movie.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:44:43
I think I saw somewhere a BTC QR etched into a diamond wedding ring.
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:15:38
Seems legit...
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:48:40
With the last BTC to be mined in the year 2140 it might be a lot more by then...
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:51:40
One day 1 Satoshi (1/100,000,000 of BTC) will be approximately $1 USD.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:45:25
We'll mine it elsewhere, asteroids, moons, planets etc.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:36:11
Currently our taxes are going to lavish golf outings and European family vacations for the orange idiot.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:10:25
In 5 years people will be kicking themselves for not buying in under $100k...
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:15:25
@_date: 2019-02-21 21:03:11
Looking forward to the day 1 Satoshi = 1 USD.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:26:41
Buy high sell low.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:36:37
Did they get it before the slight correction?
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:51:25
Incrementally buy and try not to focus on the prices.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:54:29
I thought it couldn't be possible for miners if the price fell bellow 5k?
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:02:32
It's heading back up!
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:19:09
Last one to be mined in the year 2140. Google the halving process.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:29:42
Whales want it all, don't be weak.
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:37:04
Unlike gold there is a finite supply of BTC of only 21 million of which a little over 17 million have been "mined".
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:04:07
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:46:19
Everyone should try to own at least one while they still can.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:02:16
Dang I have no memory of this scene, need to go back and watch LOTR now that GOT is over.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:34:22
They can't move them because they're locked in at much higher prices.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:05:35
Locked meaning they bought higher so they can't move their funds without taking a loss, might as well just HODL until the prices get back.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:29:57
I feel like oldsters might feel safer getting into crypto were it just a percentage of their IRA's as ETFs and whatnot, they wouldn't worry about it that way.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:18:25
The problem with that is will the alts even be around in a couple years?
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:17:11
In a couple years people will be saying "anything below 100k is a buy market"...
