Ripple doesn’t like this news at all :)

Be like Billy. . .
Buy bitcoin!!!!

Thanks! That’s the only one that I know so far for automatic purchase but I was wondering if there was a better option
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:53:31
Yeah that’s true, I honestly don’t pay much attention at the price anymore. I wish we could get Cash App in the EU since Coinbase fees really suck.
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:43:31
I think that could be an good option. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:26:24
That sounds nice! Do you know if it only works for the US?
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:54:16
I’ll try that one, many thanks again!

Today I got my Tax returns, I use them to get more Bitcoin.

So... should I go for red or yellow for my lambo?
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:00:07
That’s a great guide! Thank you for sharing!

Am I the only one who was hoping for $3K to get another full BTC?
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:19:41
I am thinking on getting one. The idea to get a full BTC node + have Lightning channels is really attractive for me. I do not have the coding skills to do it, however 300$ seems too much... could someone share if it is worth it? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-10 11:09:41
I guess that’s true. Probably ordering soon!
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:59:35
Definitely true that perspective. I could do it with enough time but I don’t have it right now so 100% agree.
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:11:34
90% BTC and 10% alts or around those numbers was always the best choice IMO.
I would start to swap alts for BTC if I were you, maybe you won’t see that as a profit right now but in some months could have interesting returns.
Anyway, that 10% of BTC still is more than most of the world population have ;)

I’ve just crossed it man. It feels so damn good

November has definitely been a stress-test for most of us on the markets, on the fundamentals I mostly see good news so, moving forward!

Guys.......... yellow or orange lambo?
