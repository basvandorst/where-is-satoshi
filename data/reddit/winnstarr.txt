I️ would hazard a guess that it was struggling to hold its low in the frenzy of forked crypto and the BTC buying craze.  ETH is a strong second to BTC but the crypto market is so volatile that at the first sign of trouble people bail and sell their stuff .  Lite coin would be the attractive option for all the reasons that makes LTC a strong crypto choice to begin with.

It’s fairly self explanatory.  There’s good you tubes on it.  The support system is very good. I made a mistake and sent LTC  to a BTC Address and it kinda disappeared.  Trezor responded in less then 7 days with a recovery tool which was literally click click click fixed.

You absolutely did the right thing.  I said the same thing when I bought at 7400 then it dropped to $5500.  Now I’m just glad I got it. At 7400.  You will feel like this next month .
