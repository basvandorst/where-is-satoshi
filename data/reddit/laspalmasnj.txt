I'm definitely going to hold, and use bitcoins personally, but I wouldn't mix the bitcoins from my business for that.

Thanks, I'll have a nice cold corona waiting, just as soon as I figure out how to accept your tip, lol

I'll be posting in bitcoin trade soon, as for the meet up, thats an excellent idea.  Hopefully I can redditors, and other bit coin users outside of reddit.  Maybe I'll schedule it to coencide with my monthly comedy open mic night ;)

My CC revenue is about 50 - 60% of total gross
I wont go into exact figures but when you consider that profit margins on restaurants are generally bellow 10% of gross sales, and that you are paying around 2 - 3% on that 60% in credit fees, you really start to feel the pain.
Charge backs are about once a month and usually on the higher bills, they are a lot of fraudsters out there.
I hope to learn more on bitcoin not only for my business but for any future avenues that it might open.

I'm looking forward to hold on to bitcoins, but not ones generated by the restaurant.  ertaisi hits it right on the head with his comment.

We add the tip to the bill on our regular pos system and the patron pays the total bill with the tip in bit coins.  We then pay out tips according to the pos ledger.
