Why do you think it'll get to 18-19?

For tax purposes, how are capital gains calculated if I've bought in at different prices?

Seems like every time bitcoin dips it comes back and stabilizes a little lower than the last dip

Yea that's not a real thing

ITT people rationalizing their weak hands during a big dip

Is it up to me? Like do I just choose the one that costs me less? Thank you for your help btw

Guys, if you predict that it will go down further AFTER it's gone down a little bit there's not a whole lot of substance to that. It's just you dealing with your own cognitive dissonance

Mmm yes, I concur.

I am 100% accurate when predicting dips after the dip has happened. I am also 100% accurate predicting bull runs after the bull run has already happened.

They are a fickle people. It is simply not nice to withhold that information from us.

I don't understand saying that Bitcoin has the fundamental problem based off of this dip/crash when every other cryptocurrency is going through the same thing.  Is it just that Bitcoin is by far the most well known crypto so it gets the brunt of criticism?

100k within the next 47 seconds
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:03:15
Once bitcoin hits 20k, it's going straight to 20k. And it will stay there for an indeterminate amount of time
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:29:55
It appears as though the market has forgotten that bitcoin died last month
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:26:06
Yes. But also, no.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:22:07
Beware, once it hits 9k, it will plummet to 9k and, again, will stay there for an indeterminate amount of time. Mark my words
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:59:48
If the dip cannot be predicted, did it really happen?

The world is not yet ready.
