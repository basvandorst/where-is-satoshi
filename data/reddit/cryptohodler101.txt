Dogecoin... Wtf is this crypto world coming to. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:39:37
I beleive it will cause the price to start increasing when the new round of futures are locked in. 
I am 99% sure that this crash was because of future shorting. Now bitcoin is as low as it will go time to go long on the futures. Watch bitcoin pump in the next few weeks.

There is a reason they wont let you move more than 10k at a time. AML. 
U drop 100k into your bank account and watch that get frozen and they will ask questions where j got this money etc. Under 10k is safe. Satoshi lounge is also a good one.

Clearly they are deep in the pocket of Ver and his cronies.
It makes no sense to now call btrash bitcoin on block explorer. It isn't bitcoin it's btrash. 
That whole announcement sounded exacly like ver. I would not be suprised at all if he wrote it.

an't that the truth. i have been burned hard now i just accumulate btc. once btc goes on a run the alts will bleed hard. just like every other time.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:32:59
because bitcoin is more valuable than USD.

Can you do one where he apologies to absolutely fookn nobody, cause bitcoin does with the fook  it wants!
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:59:42
You even mention BTC (funny cause its r/btc) and the cult members come out calling you all types of names and your spreading FUD, BCH is the real BTC etc. every post is nearly exactly the same. 
if you say you sold all your BTC for BCH they all cheer and say how it was the best choice because BTC is dead etc..
I have to admit i did troll them a bit in that post. What suprised me is that sub always harps on about non censorship. another lie.

Preaching HODL while drunk! U have no idea just like I have no idea. He could have sold the next week for all we know. He could be rich or he could be broke. 
How do you know that when his gf got back from the lesbian bar she broke up with him. Since it was her house he had to move out. He didn't have any money so sold his bitcoin. 
You don't know and i don't know. That's why you said he could be rich and I said he could also be poor. 
All of this is assumptions. Maybe he is rich living it up. Maybe he necked himself after he sold out. No one knows.

It isn't about feel good. It's about seeing a fellow human struggling and doing your part to make someone else's life better. 
Trust me, if you were in a shit hole like that u would be scamming as well. We all would. You scam or you starve. That's your options.

Answers you will get:
Sell n00b and using something else
Bitcoin is a store of value
Don't make small transactions then
Stop being poor
LN is the solution 
Kill yourself
Bigger blocks leads to centralization
It's only expensive because it has exploded in growth
You must be new
I think that should cover most answers.

He might be. But I doubt it. U need to understand that most scammers from 3rd world countries do it to survive  not buy lambos.
Take a trip to one of these places one day and see if you can spot a lambo. You will be lucky to spot a paved road.

@_date: 2017-12-20 12:08:05
I beleive that is the case. Oneday 8mb won't be large  enough. What is the plan then? Raise it to 16mb?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:55:06
It's easy to cash out. Just keep it under 10k at a time to avoid AML

He isn't gonna take it out. He has to wait a minimum of 160 days before he can even attempt it. I don't care about the fees. I get paid in bitcoin 5 times a week. Like I said he's getting a small amount not lambo money 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:28:02
i agree. not like it will stop those 19 yo kids anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:22:28
Prob the same reason your neighbour doesn't know about it.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:04:33
Agree with the chargeback. Nothing worse than sending crypto to an incorrect address and it's gone forever. A safety feature needs to be put in n place somehow. 
Yea u just hear that all the time on the news how crypto is only used only used for illegal activity. Even though when they point out bitcoin in these examples they fail to mention that every transaction made is recorded and public. Just cant see who the accounts belong to. Regardless that is way more transparent than the current system is.
I dont think it is AMLs business where u send your money and how much you send. It's your money regardless of how you obtained it.
Tbh I think the thing they worry about the most is tax. How to tax crypto. They already take 40% of my income but it's never enough for the government stealing 40% off me. Because it is stealing. Then they spend my money that I earned and they stole on bs. I would at least like to have a say where my tax goes and I get a say on how and where my taxable income is used and get a transaction record of every dollar. Then I might be okay with it. Until then  I will avoid paying as much as possible just like the elite do.

No charge back is by design. Also fiat is used to buy more illegal goods than anything. That black market argument is a joke.
Best use case is transferring over large distances. Can send 100k to the other side of the planet in mins. Cant do that with fiat.

It's not that hard. U get a form and you tick a few boxes. Then u get a report annually. If they cant do that then they are abusing my taxable income because they should know where every dollar goes. 
Yes I rounded it off to 40%. In my country it's at 37% over  90k a year.

@_date: 2018-04-27 13:26:03
Because it isn't bitcoin. Btrash groupies like to k it is. Fact is, you can call a man a woman, dress him like a woman, have surgery to look like a woman, but at the end of the day it's a fuckn man. Proof is in the DNA. 
BTC has the genesis block. BTC has the majority hash rate. BTC is decided by consensus. 
Btrash has none of these but they say they are BTC....
