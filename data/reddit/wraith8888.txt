Only got rid of Visa in its 134 Smith's stores. No effect on its 2782 Kroger stores. The fact that the possibility of 134 stores countrywide taking Bitcoin shows how low the bar is for exciting Bitcoin news. Bitcoin being a widely accepted currency within retail is a long road to reach the critical point

This article is wholly about Smith's not Kroger stores.

Read the article. It's really not.

Amazon is worth $1 Trillion while Sears, another online seller is worth less than $1 Billion. Get in on the ground floor of Sears!

My point was that Amazon's success doesn't indicate shit in predicting the success of another business with something in common with it. And even less so does a company losing a large chunk of value have anything to do with future value of Bitcoin in any way whatsoever. OP was comparing apples to moon rocks.

Yeah, that was the important part of my point. How thorough and up to date my financial data on Amazon is.

I finally took the plunge the past couple weeks also. Bought a few hundred $$ at first and then a couple more purchases. Have a quarter of a Bitcoin  :)

Who can't pay? I'm not talking about YOUR Bitcoins you lunatic. I'm talking about you wanting people to meet some long list of your requirements before PURCHASING it for themselves, with their own money, not from you, having nothing to do with you. Are you reading anything I write before you rant back at me?

Damn. Yesterday my mother told me the government was making it illegal. Your grandma-in-law must have the same info.

But you have rules for people before they buy Bitcoin.  I think the idea is for it to become more ubiquitous and valuable which won't happen if 0.02% of the population is qualified to buy it in your eyes.

Apparently for the same reason you can't understand that having a set of rules for OTHER PEOPLE before they buy Bitcoin making it a currency only for certain people is pretty much the opposite of the whole point of Bitcoin.
