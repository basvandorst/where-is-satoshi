In the US, members of our senate subcommittee on technology have admitted to never having sent an email. How has Canada advanced to the point of requesting finger prints in the prochain of a crypto currency?

On regionalization; is it possible to keep bitcoin as the "global" crypto currency or would scalability and transaction throughput benifet from 7 or 8 (or n) regional  exchanges that could focus on speed

You can save some time by keeping this one in queue for next week

You haven't had 4.7k in that account for quite some [time]( There is no point to asking a question and censoring your public address. It is a public ledger so we can all see every transaction. The qr code you didn't(and shouldn't) blur is also your public address.

I've been kicking around the same idea for mobile. Have you worked with A-frame any?
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:07:51
It's a browser based vr frame work. Mozilla wanted an open source option for vr. It is all front end and pretty responsive. I've been toying around with it for about a month or so, but it is pretty intuitive  Check it out at Aframe.io

Very cool, will you be making the results available after the tests(aside from audit nodes)?

Unfortunately, a "grownup" took the time to site down and compose this, sent it in, and it is forever logged in the annals of the sec for btc
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:42:06
Yeah  that is what I'm more curious about, the networks reaction as far as fees, avg processing times, which pools mine the transactions, etc. Very cool test case especially with it being announced ahead of time.

Real comments submitted to SEC:
The Winklevoss twins also known as the Winklevii are two gorgeous men, lets be real here, they have never had any trouble with the ladies. They are very rich, and also very handsome. 
If you didn’t know already, these two angelic men have competed in the men’s rowing event at the 2008 Bejing Olympics, which only made their biceps and triceps larger.
I would like the ETF to get approved, I do not think there is any reason for the ETF to not get approved, this is a great thing for bitcoin.
Best regards,

What do you estimate the cost in fees will be for the test?

Now that btcc is activly mining ETC, will would be selling physical blocks,chips, and coins for it as well?
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:02:30
AWESOME! I've bought before and will buy again. You guys rock.

Local dealer or atm

Daily volume is around $3.5 billion usd, the market would absorb it. You best bet would be to contact institutional investors, Gemini or Genesis, and do it over the counter

Strange how Snowdens boogie man NSA can't crack a single iPhone with out causing a national incident. Also this is only very vaguely bitcoin related
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:21:00
Snowden has referenced both. I am using NSA because it is more like to have the capabilities needed. Edward snowden is a modern day Bob Lazar .

The only sane way to have a wallet on your phone is if it is part of a 2-2 or 2-3 multi. Many people don't feel comfortable because the overarching concept is very high tech and may as well be magic. The concepts of a dao or smart contract or mining block chains are lost on them completely. Naked selfies,  text messages, and phone logs are what normal people worry about.
In any case, snowden has painted a picture of a agency so powerful the idea of encryption on a phone would be moot as they would already have used colabrative filtering to I'd the owner as a terrorist . yet this guy, the shooter, had a government issued phone and "they" can't unlock it, and this is a case stopper!? . To the opposite extreme of snowend in fact, a locked phone gets national news coverage and Facebook  , apple, and Microsoft come off as good guys who fight the government on privacy.

So how does the future guy get tell money out of it
Edit, I'm didn't realize the private key is on the right covered
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:24:49
I picked one up. a small one of course. It seems like a neat concept and a classy cold storage wallet!
