The point is that when btc get stolen on Coinbase, it's almost always the user's fault. They had a post recently about all of the changes they've made security-wise in the past year, and you can tell it's had an affect due to the stories of thefts on their platform virtually disappearing.
Also the claim in your quote is just wrong. According to a survey not too long ago, most of the users in this very forum report losing more money to their own mistakes than to cloud wallet systems going down or being hacked:

If you are actually worried about the security of a 3rd party having access to your account... *why would you give them access to your account*?  The solution is to revoke it.
There is no magical combination of things any bitcoin service provider could do to simultaneously provide access to your account and not provide it, at the same time.  That seems to be what you are asking for.  It doesn't even make sense.

I dunno, I might get downvotes for this, but the undertone of this article seems to be envy. You might think that those who dislike silicon valley might say "good, let them go" - but they don't. They say "we must prevent this from happening." In reality, they realize they want all the stuff SV produces to filter back to them, and there is a genuine fear that such a state might actually be better.  And to have that displayed in reality - to be left out of that kind of place and have nothing to offer it, and nothing to leech off of it either - to be left out of a prosperous system that you guaranteed couldn't exist and that you didn't *want* to exist - would sort of be the ultimate humiliation. I think this is at least part of the reason so many people so vehemently hate the idea.
Plus this is just a vote to put it on the ballot anyway, not the vote itself. Shouldn't everything be on the ballot? Why would you not want something to be voted on unless you feared that its what people actually wanted?

You'd think that Bitpay would only provide the tools for displaying a payment address if everything were setup such that some kind of event would happen upon payment to it.
I'd be kind of shocked if this wasn't the case, so I think some error must have happend on Bitpay's end here.

@_date: 2014-08-04 09:42:53
For the record this is a choice made by Wikipedia, not Coinbase.  CB provides the ability to collect this info and the merchant chooses whether or not to enable it. Complaining about CB here isn't going to accomplish anything.
Wikipedia probably does it because they have regulations about who they can accept money from... just like anyone else.  So you can complain to them too, but that also won't accomplish anything.
So if you want this changed, you have to fight the regulations. It always goes back to that.

Not sure what the issue is.  Actually seems like this would be preferable in many cases because you are not exposed to volatility risk over the 4-day waiting period.

I disagree with that estimate. The first time nobody had a clear estimate of how cheap the coins would be, so you had a good number of people participating to find out, in the chance that they'd get lucky and land a good deal. Now there's a solid foundation for what kind of discount to expect. They can't get them at a 30% off, only probably at a 20-10% discount, which isn't enough, so they're not interested.
If these companies had a demand for above-market value coins, they could just buy them right now on an exchange. There is nothing preventing them from doing literally this moment. Waiting to bid on them en masse for above market rate doesn't make sense.

The most important thing is: when you keep your BTC denominated in dollars, where is the actual proof that you still have the BTC that the dollars are backed by?  Do you get to see that?  If they are literally just telling you that you have that amount, without there being a real accountable backing, then (1) they probably require a money transmitter license, which I doubt they have, so I would fear them closing due to regulation, and (2) what happens if the price falls by 10x and they need to add 10x btc to every account?  Where do they get that?  I have a feeling they'd be screwed.

Paying bounties for bugs is actually a great way to make your site secure.
They don't pay for bugs "because they have them," they pay to make sure that they do not.
If hackers have an incentive to claim a prize instead and a reputation bump instead of trying an exploit, they're much more likely to report, which is why this method is so successful. Coinbase is making the reward for helping greater than the reward for hurting.  That's really smart.
Companies who don't do this are much more open to exploits being used against them.

Since I can't reveal more I understand if you don't believe me, but you should consider that that speculation was strictly from redditors here, none of whom are particularly qualified to make estimates about why it would be higher, other than enthusiasm.
A lower than market bid doesn't mean anything bad, it's just purely rational. *No* bidders bid above market last time. Draper just didn't go as far down as others.

In other words they are purposely blurring the line between bitcoin the protocol and their own private company for selfish gain.
This sort of "rebranding" really has the affect of confusing new people, who will think bitpay is "the bitcoin company."  That is the goal.
Why on earth would you name something "bitcore," when the main open source product itself is called "bitcoin core," if your goal was not confusion?  It doesn't even mirror what the original does.
Same with their new logo, which is the exact same font as "bitcoin", with a few letters swapped out.
These changes aren't noble, they're wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:21:48
You'll hear a lot about them storing your bitcoin so it's "not really yours". While there's sort of a philosophic element of truth to this, their policy is to let you withdraw your bicoin if they have any kind of AML/KYC reason against you, and generally speaking it's an excellent spending wallet and extremely secure.
On top of that, they do provide a multisig vault which, believe it or not, they actually have no access to. This means they couldn't block or take your money if they wanted to - you and *only* you have access.

It takes 4 business days for any purchase to go through on coinbase, whether it succeeds or is canceled due to a previous reversal, fraud potential, etc.  This has always been true.  Seems you actually got lucky because this support dude was willing to tell you that your subsequent purchases would be canceled as well instead of making you wait to find out on your own.
You do get an email about it when the cancellation is actually canceled.  It's the infamous "high risk" email.
Complaints about these emails have been hilariously absent from this subreddit as of late, since the price is going down instead of up, and I suppose users are actually finding themselves saved by this more often than hurt from it.  When we see another upswing, expect a lot more of them to start rolling in again...

I am talking about companies like Coinbase and Circle. I think generally we want companies to be able to be built around bitcoin, right? I know some hardcore anarchists believe all companies are evil, but there is a difference between what is inherent in their nature and what they are compelled to do.

Also, Coinbase already provided the ability to create merchant tools that pay directly to a multisig vault, which they have no access to. So there was a lot of hoopla about "something that's never been done before", but it has been... multiple times.
The bigger thing though is that any big merchant who accepts bitcoin payments is going to want to convert it to their local currency. This is why they use Coinbase / Circle / BitPay. These mycelium and Coinsimple solutions are cool, but will only ever be used by redditors.

I hate to break it to you, but you didn't catch anything.
Your whole other post relies on the *assumption* that Coinbase would not be using the vast majority of p2sh addresses.
What if they simply are?
Even though your post contains numbers, it is not scientific. Unless you can prove that &gt; 5% of p2sh addresses are used by people other than Coinbase, then you haven't proved that Coinbase owns &lt; 5% of them.
In other words, it boils down to "I don't believe them, therefore they have lied."

I can't tell if you're just trolling me but network fees and coinbase fees are not the same. I know coinbase provides merchant tools. The fee they take from that is not the same as the network fee.

You're just not addressing anything I'm actually saying. A decentralized settlement layer wouldn't compete with Coinbase. You can't buy bitcoin from a "decentralzied settlement layer".

The existence of a settlement layer that reduces fees benefits Coinbase.

No, it doesn't. The price is not static. The spot price only applies to the first penny. If you buy more, the price per bitcoin gets higher and if you sell more, the price per bitcoin gets lower.

Who says that those other services use multisig exclusively, instead of in part like Coinbase? I think many probably say they use it for the cred...
In any case, you can't just list a bunch of names and expect that to count as science. That's not hard numbers. You don't have them.
Your edit also doesn't catch anything. They switched from saying "stored in multisig and AES" to "stored in AES". Wow, big whoop. This actually seems benign since it's exactly in line with what the CEO said in his comment - they use multisig but not necessarily for everything.
I think there's a deep desire here to see Coinbase as a failure since the core devs here despise them, but being one of the first and few user-friendly services, no, i would not be surprised if they held so much.
But in the end if you want to prove anything you have to provide the numbers, and you don't have them. Sorry, you just don't.

Actually everything about that is wrong. Coinbase would love for there to be zero cost to sending a transaction, and they are not opposed to lightning or thunder or any of that.
Again, it's important to understand this point: *network fees actually make business more expensive for Coinbase*. Do you get that part?
*Coinbase makes its revenue from brokerage sales, which are completely different*. Do you get that part?
The reason Coinbase argues for a block size increase is because they think it will be better for Bitcoin. Again: *Coinbase is not opposed to layers built on bitcoin like lightning or thunder*. Do you get that part?
If you doubt me, you should ask them.
Where did you even get this idea?

We have different perspectives. I contend that the average is somewhat meaningless. If the average is okay, it gives us no information, because that's how thing are supposed to work anyway. Edge cases aren't outliers if they still happen with frequency. And if they're some order of magnitude worse than before, you have that order of magnitude more chance of experiencing it, and bitcoin is that much worse.
If you're an internet provider and your network latency over 24 hours doesn't move much on average, but 1s+ ping times increase from 1% to 5%, it's not something you ignore, it's a critical error that gets immediate attention.
Problems for everyone start at the edge. And those experiencing them leave, and then somebody else becomes the edge, and it repeats until users siphon off to another provider.

Are you doing other buys outside of your recurring one? Because as soon as you do, you push your limit over the edge, since $100 is already up against it.
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:32:33
But your limit doesn't reset at midnight, it replenishes linearly over 24 hours. So even if you made one purchase 4 1/2 months ago, it seems like it'd be enough to throw your limits off balance, because they're never fully replenishing, because you keep purchasing every 24 hours.
Edit: Thought you said daily buy but you said weekly buy... not sure then.

Honestly, despite what most people here will tell you, your bitcoin are probably most safe on Coinbase. Their security is world class. If security is your top priority, consider keeping some of it there.
If "being your own bank" / anonymity is your top priority, use something else. Just keep in mind that more people lose bitcoin to self-error than to the failings of large exchanges. It is a choice that is generally more motivated by philosophy than practicality. And there's nothing wrong with that, but you should be aware of the additional risks.

Bitcoin won't be worth nearly as much as it could be if there isn't a legit, consumer-friendly ecosystem developed around it.

The other obvious option being Craig Wright spent a lot of time doing his homework on Satoshi, has a natural character overlap, and has pulled a con on many people, including Gavin.

Jesus people, it's not about you and your endless block size war. I don't even necessarily believe this guy is the real thing, *yet*, but you can't deny that Gavin out of anyone would have a pretty relevant opinion on what Satoshi might be like. And that's all he's offering, his opinion.
Why not let's wait until the story congeals a bit before finding reasons to bash people you dislike?
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:43:14
Replying to my own comment, I see two alternative theories for the single signature:
1) He somehow came to possess a single proof that had been generated by Satoshi in the past.
2) He used his supercomputer to brute force a signal signature. (The article mentions this as a theory too, though I don't know the calculations for how real a possibility it is.)
If you're gonna come out as Satoshi why be ambiguous about it? We've already been through it. Just be clear as day already. Providing the text that the signature for yourself doesn't do anything to help, he's really gotta sign something that's given to him.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:19:47

Nobody doubts that core is working very hard.
The problem is that they as a single group cannot do everything. And they are closed and non-inclusive, so others do not have a chance to contribute.
This means that there is no typical developer community. Communities are collaborative. There is a developer group, but not a developer community.
So one group of people is trying to do the work that should be spread across many groups. As a result they say "we're so busy we can't even keep up with everything." But it doesn't matter, because the business of a few pales in comparison to the potential productivity of many more.
This is why bitcoin development is slow, despite its current developers working at full blast.
There is no amount of effort that this one group could put forth by itself which would change this. Because the problem is not how hard they're working, it's how many are working.

Well Craig Wright claims to have signed something with a private key of Satoshi's. So why don't you check it and get back to us because if it's real that's pretty solid evidence.
The verdict is still out on whether it's legit. But until it's proved insufficient, which basically nobody has had the time to do yet, it seems like your opinion may be a little bit premature.
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:20:06
Well, can he sign messages with satoshi's keys or not? He claims to have signed one message. Where is it? Is it valid? (I really don't know, if somebody knows how to check that'd be awesome.)
The fishiest thing about the story to me after a glance is that he apparently would refuse to sign other arbitrary messages given to him by the news organizations, because he doesn't want to "jump through hoops". Wtf? Signing takes like 10 seconds, you should be able to sign something on demand with little effort.
Edit: See the other top-level comments in this thread. There appears to be some evidence that the signature provided was just pulled from an old blockchain transaction. I don't know if that qualifies as full disproof but it's not looking good for Mr. Wright. (Not to mention the fact that he didn't even provide the text that the signature was supposed to be of.)
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:04:52

@_date: 2017-05-17 07:18:31
Yes, it does. Not sure what your point is. This post is about transactions sent from Coinbase to an off-Coinbase address, which must necessarily go over the bitcoin network and incur fees.

What I'm saying is Gavin may have believed he saw proof, but glossed over or did not catch errors in how it was presented to him.

IMO that was a pretty passive aggressive post that didn't explain *why* donations dropped. I assume the people running the experiment were predisposed to be against bitcoin.
What probably happened was that the API request to generate the bitcoin payment page added non-trivial time to the page load, and it was the resulting speed difference that lowered total donations, not the simple presence of a bitcoin option.
They weren't very scientific about it.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:07:53
I'm as happy as anyone else to see a con revealed, but we have zero way of knowing if Gavin was part of a "conspiracy" or was just conned himself like anyone else. I'd like to think he'd figure it out, but maybe he couldn't. Efforts to label him an "accomplice" while knowing literally nothing else about the background of this story come strictly from a place of personal dislike and malevolence. We should strive to be a more constructive community than this.

That doesn't make any sense. Coinbase is a wallet and they currently pay the fee for you when you send. They would love it if there were no fees.
Coinbase takes fees when you *buy* or *sell* on their platform. Bitcoin network fees are completely different and have nothing to do with that.
I don't mean to be a dick but this is the most significant/retarded misunderstanding of fees I have ever encountered.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:27:40
Because not every detail they look at is viewed through the perspective of the company as a whole. It's full of various individuals who run all sorts of separate, small pieces. Something like running a bitcoin experiment on the donations page is a one-dev operation. It's easily small enough scope to be skewed by whatever biases are brought to the table.
Even if the dev wasn't anti-bitcoin they still failed to provide an actual explanation. Latency seems much more reasonable than teh simple presence of the bitcoin option, given how unobtrusive it was.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:16:30

A lot of people are liberal and the success of bitcoin is basically empirical evidence of certain liber*tarian* principles. Their reaction is due to fear, their fear is from an implicit acknowledgment that certain economic/political principles which they vehemently oppose may in fact be in better accordance with the way the world works.
Edit: emphasis
Edit: Alright, "liberal" was an overgeneralization.  Wasn't being literal there.  I mean that there's a group of people who are afraid of the idea that freedom/the free market are better/more efficient/more naturally inline with human nature than government control.  This group overlaps with, but is not equivalent to, liberals and many other political groups.

Sounds like growing pains.  I don't think there is any evidence here that there's a fundamental, irreparable issue with Coinbase.
If using Coinbase in this state isn't something you're happy with, don't use it.  If experiencing occasional bugginess to support a new player in the BTC transaction market is something you can live with, then go for it.  They'll get more stable over time.
Personally I've never had a problem with them.  A part of me just wishes their 24 hour purchase limit was a little higher, cause I haven't been able to buy for the past day.

See my above comment.  Also, people realize that any percentage it can rise from a low point, it can also rise from a higher point, right?!
People who want it to go back down before going up are short-term speculators who don't really care for the long-term value Bitcoin has.  If they believed in the concept, they'd know it can rise by just the same percentage from the current point.

It doesn't matter that bitcoin goes down to only 8 decimal places right now, because at its current valuation, that is a finer division than any fiat.  It is only necessary for any crypto currency to be more divisible than that when the smallest unit of the currencies being converted into the crypto currency, no longer have individual purchasing power.
Right now a penny will buy you somewhere near 0.0001 bitcoins.  Only when a penny can buy you less than 0.00000001 bitcoins will it be necessary for bitcoin to be any further divisible.
By the time that's anywhere near a reality, the necessary protocol changes for that to happen will already be in place.  So it doesn't matter that it requires a change.
Also the analogy is wrong, because it is not easier for low-capital investors to acquire litecoin.  You can say that it's easier for low-capital investors to acquire a *larger fraction of the total market cap of the crypto currency*, but you can't say it's easier to acquire litecoin outright.  You can invest $1000 in LTC or $1000 in BTC - it's the same either way.  You just get a different slice of the pie.
Which just goes back to my original point that the only reason Litecoin exists is for late adopters to bitcoin to become early adopters in Litecoin, trying to push an alternative wherein they reap benefits they didn't catch earlier.
(As an aside: for some reason people fixate on numbers a lot.  Like they can't afford to buy AAPL stock because it's $500/share.  People don't realize the price just doesn't matter - growth does.  Whether you buy 1 share of something at $500, or 10 shares at $50, or 100 shares at $5, if it grows by 20%, no matter what the price/share ratio is, you're going to make the same amount of money on your investment, even if you just bought part of a share.)
We can say these currencies complement each other, but they don't.  There isn't anything complementary about them.  Complementary means they provide mutually beneficial functions that the others don't.  But they are the same; there is only duplication, and it doesn't serve a purpose.

Bitcoin is the gold and the silver, and everything down to the dirt, because it's infinitely divisible.
Litecoin will no doubt grow some due to being adopted by people who hope to make a killing where they missed it with bitcoin, but there is nothing it's adding to the table in terms of innovation or practical use, so that won't last forever.  It has no purpose.  Litecoin is *fool's bitcoin*, worth only the price it takes to store it: nothing.

Something you should know: I typed in my email address on your site to be added to your email list.  I got a mailchimp confirmation and clicked "yes, subscribe me to this list."  That button opens a confirmation page, which has a button that says "Continue to our site" or something like that.  When I clicked that, it took me to a site called "bitremit.com."  That was pretty confusing.  At first I thought something was insecure but more likely you guys have multiple operations going on and you overlooked something.  I guess?
Besides that, it's a shame you guys weren't around a few months ago.  I know a business that just started using IDology for this exact thing, and their whole service is ugly, outdated, unintuitive and utterly, utterly drawn out. For some reason you find yourself having to contact customer support twice a day for a month while integrating. They don't make it simple enough to do yourself without having to speak to a customer support rep very frequently.  Why?!
A simple API like yours with published documentation would've been a dream to use in comparison.  I hope you get your name out there and become a bigger player in this space.  Just keep focusing on making your product better and easier to use.  I think Bitcoin is a great space to promote yourself.
Edit: One thing you would need to add, however, is the option to present a user with questions based on their publicly available data, to confirm it's really them.  For example, those questions like "In what year did you purchase your Ford Taurus," or "From whom did you purchase your home at 123 Fake St?"  It looks like you don't have that right now.

All this means is that we have to get through a period of volatility before we can expect stability.  $10,000/coin is almost 8,000% growth away from where we are now.  That's far.  That's a lot of volatility to go through first.
People who say the value should stabilize generally mean they want it to start stabilizing now, meaning the price should stop going up or down significantly, meaning (without knowing it) that growth should slow.
Either you believe that bitcoin is something that has massive potential right now, which means it should be adopted quickly, which means it will be volatile until market cap is very high, or you believe it's not really that important in the world, and stability is possible because adoption will be low.
You cannot take the stance that bitcoin is massively useful now, and deserves to experience mass adoption in the short-term, and also expect there to be price stability in the short-term.  It's contradictory.

Fraud prevention / account security is the only reasonable answer.  If you're going to get tinfoil hat paranoid about it, please at least provide a reasonable alternative explanation.
If you're seen as signing in with a certain device fingerprint from a certain location frequently, and then they get a login attempt on your account from Romania with a different fingerprint, don't you *want* them to be able to detect that and use that info to help keep your account secure?
A device fingerprint is just a number representing a lot of information you already send to every website you visit anyway.  It's not sneaky, dark magic.

The point is that it's a criticism of bitcoin *now*, but not a criticism of bitcoin itself, *conceptually*, in the long-term - unless it's actually provably impossible.
Another point: Not adopting technology due to short-term faults is a bad idea.  If we never adopted solar panels, we would not have increased their efficiency by orders of magnitude.  If we don't accept electric cars because they can't go 500 miles in one run, well, they never will, because they won't develop.  But is it conceptually possible?  Yes.  Will we probably get to that point, because some group of us is willing to deal with the short-term state of technology in the meantime?  Yes.  Same with realtime physical bitcoin transactions.
So, sorry, it's not an inane observation, because some people (e.g. politicians who are allowed to make most of our economic decisions) only think in the short-term, and do not realize that this is the flow of technological progress.  Pointing it out opens peoples' minds.
Edit: it's also completely different from the cancer patient example you gave.  The cancer patient has no alternative choice, so there's no point in telling them about something that *could* exist, because it doesn't help them now.  The patient needs help now.  The currency user does not need help now.  In fact, they do not necessarily even need "help" - technology is just a way to make their life easier than it already is.  You're comparing physically needing something to conceptually wanting something.  It's an apples to oranges comparison.

Further, the less something has a practical use, the more well suited it is for being a currency, since its scarcity is not related to a market (like electronics) in which supply and demand can drastically alter its value.
For example, if starting tomorrow, a new, cheap compound with the same properties as gold was found, and gold was no longer needed in electronics, its price would drop as a result of lack of supply in that specific market.  A currency without that vulnerability is better off for it.

I agree.  Adoption and usefulness will fuel each other.  Neither comes first.

Sounds like they can just throw out "Oh, but we're being DDOSed" whenever they can't handle legitimate traffic.
If they're getting high traffic it's likely their own customers flooding in, expecting to be able to trade, and MtGox is failing them.

According to the footer, the site is a product of payward, inc.  If you go to payward.com, it gives the impression that payward is going to also be its own, separate virtual currency exchange.
So my question is, are kraken.com and payward.com going to be separate exchanges?  If so, why would one company (payward) make both of them instead of just operating one?

Coinbase is fine for currency exchange, but don't use it as a hot wallet.  Because it isn't actually a hot wallet.  Most coins are stored offline in cold storage.  For transactions to complete, they have to get your coins in a send-able state first, and then fire off the transaction.  How quickly this happens depends on lots of opaque factors we have no insight into.
Coinbase isn't meant to be used as a hot wallet.  (Though they don't actually say this anywhere and they probably should.)
You should have bitcoins that you want to potentially spend in a wallet that acts instantly, like blockchain.info.  Transactions there are always fired instantly, because your coins are not stored in some abstract pool that relies on the company's managing.  It's just a plain bitcoin wallet with nothing between you and a raw bitcoin transaction.

I completely agree.  All I'm saying is that there seems to be a number of people who want bitcoin to perpetually remain in the volatile state, without ever graduating into becoming something more stable with a higher market cap.  And if you don't want that, why do you want to invest in it?  So it these comments seem contradictory.  I'm not saying people shouldn't take advantage of crashes when they happen - that's great.  Please do.  I'm saying the desire for that to be something that *doesn't end* is not a good desire.

It takes the same amount of time to generate bitcoins regardless of the amount of compute power put into it.  That's the whole point.

I really don't think this is the reason.  People don't react with vitriol when you tell them about something they think is a scam; they either laugh at you or try to warn you.  People react the way the OP is talking about when they have a philosophical/ideological problem with something.  For example, people often react to Ayn Rand the same way.
Regardless of what you think of her, it's typically because she represents an idea they disagree with, but her arguments are well presented and they are afraid they may discover that something antithetical to their beliefs is true if they spend some time investigating the ideas.  The fear is an auto reaction meant to deny the possibility outright, so one doesn't have to go through the pain/disappiontment of having to change their worldview; an automatic reaction - the unconscious goal of which is to sway the other person simply by convincing them with your level of disdain for their idea.
I think it's the same way with bitcoin.  People only become "upset" if they sense there's some meat behind the argument for it or that there is some real value in its presence, when their core economic/political values say there shouldn't be.
Btw, not trying to make any sort of positive/negative assessment of Rand, just saying that that phenomenon exists when she's mentioned.

Me too.  I hope that whatever exchange becomes the new default, if one does, is smart enough to:
1) Decouple its trading platform from its web platform, so that a DDOS only brings down the public-facing website, and doesn't majorly lag all trading
2) Is smart enough to pause trading when they're unable to process the orders they already have
3) Can prevent bots that place 100 micro trades/minute from swamping their system, if it's something they cannot handle
Maybe we as the community should audit all of the popular exchanges and see which one most closely matches these needs (and possibly others), and then explicitly promote that one as the replacement for MtGox.
The message of "This *specific* exchange would be a better default" may be more powerful than "Please change to anything that isn't MtGox."  If we pick one and the community keeps repeating their decision, it's bound to have impact.

This part of the story seemed so strange to begin with.  I'm actually surprised so many people believe it without more evidence.  It goes against everything he stood for, which doesn't in itself mean he's innocent but shows that creating some event like this would be the only real way to destroy his reputation.
I really hope that one (or a few) of bitcoin's rich beneficiaries decide to help his legal defense fund.  And then if he wins in the murder-for-hire case, a subsequent suing of the government as well.

The price shown is often the *last* price, not the price at which coins would be sold at that exact moment.
MtGox usually has the most relevant price because it has the most volume by far, meaning its most recent transaction is often much shorter time ago.
There are ups and downs all day during trading.  On the smaller exchanges, if the last trade was 15 minutes or an hour ago, it most likely represents demand at that time, and not what you'd get if you sold or bought right now.  MtGox, however, might be showing a last price from 5 seconds ago, which is much more relevant.
Not to mention the entirely different aspect that all exchanges simply have different user bases, who may potentially value bitcoins differently.

It can't be a viable currency until mass adoption.  Mass adoption necessitates growth.  It has to go from a market cap of less than 2 billion to possibly hundreds of billions or trillions to be a "viable currency."  From a few million users to billions of users.
Sentiments along the lines of: "For bitcoin to be adopted, it should be stable first" don't make sense, because adoption (demand) drives the instability. That statement is the equivalent of saying "For bitcoin to grow, it should not be growing."

There's a huge selection bias when hearing about this stuff: the people who experience it (even if they are only the small minority) are the ones constantly going off about it and making sure everybody knows their pain.
People who have perfectly fine experiences (the vast majority), have no reason to complain because service is good.
Occam's razor: your friggin' transfer was high risk.  That's it.  There are much easier ways Coinbase could make lots of money than *defrauding customers*, such as simply *charging a higher percentage*.

You realize that account security is much more complex than just using one number, and that device fingerprint is only one metric out of many?  What "OP said" is far from proof of anything of any kind.  One example out of potential thousands is that if the user were to initiate a new bank transfer, it would be marked as "high risk" and canceled 4 days later, as has been notorious with coinbase.
It's just so strange to me when people are open minded enough to think that people are collecting their data to "build a fingerprint database and link it with real identities [for another company]", but not open minded enough to consider the much more benign (and likely) case that it's just being used to protect your or Coinbase's assets.
It's like you started at open-mindedness but then skipped rationality and jumped straight to conspiracy theory.  Occam's Razor, my friend.  There is simply zero evidence for conspiracy theory here.

Trying to play the market is the ultimate mistake, you will end up burned.
If someone told you to sell at 128 today "before it drops lower," and you did - you'd be out even more money since it actually went back up.
Don't try to game it.  There is no quick buck.  Either put money in and sit on it long term and do not pay attention to the day price, or convert your btc sales to dollars immediately (like with Coinbase merchant tools).
Again, trying to play the market will just get you burned and turn you off from the whole idea.  It won't be Bitcoin's fault, it'll be yours.

Why is everyone hoping for the price to crash to buy some?  You know that a crashing price is a horrible thing for the currency and is a bad sign for future adoption and growth, right?
People: please realize that the price doesn't matter at all for investing.  Growth does.  Buying 0.1 btc at $300 or 1 btc at $30 are the same exact thing.  In either case, when btc rises by 10%, you make $3.
Deciding how many bitcoin you want to buy, then determining how much money you need for it is backwards.  First just determine how much money you're willing to spend on btc, then go invest that amount of money, regardless of the price, because the price does not matte as long as you see growth potential.

People will *always* be wanting one more opportunity, which essentially means they want to invest in something where the price never truly rises long-term, just goes on little rollercoaster hills, up and down by 20% perpetually.
