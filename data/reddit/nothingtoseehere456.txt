I think what I'm doing is something people call research...

Wow, that is an excellent write-up and really exactly the kind of response I was looking for. You touched on this a bit, the only reason why exchanges currently can be influenced by public pressure is because there is true competition; people will just use other exchanges. Once politics and power get more heavily involved, what's to stop this from going the way of Wall Street where there are fewer options and they are all heavily compromised to no follow the will of the users, so the users no longer have any influence over the direction of the chain?
I feel like unless there is a way to decentralize we are essentially creating the currency that will ultimately be co-opted by a future world government.

Thing is, if the currencies are all competing with each other won't this make the price of the currencies very volatile? This is one of the main arguments of fiat with QE, but I think we can agree cryptocurrencies are much more volatile. As long as we at least have to pay taxes in local currency, won't this be a constant big forex risk?

That's a good point, I suppose if people were concerned about the upcoming UASF the price of BTC would probably be dropping to reflect that?
How do you decide the upgrades in a public manner without anonymous votes?

Thanks for the reply, would you mind ELI5?

Won't miners also always be at odds with users, as miners want higher transaction fees and users low? I see this being a never-ending battle, and hard forks are a lot scarier if bitcoin actually had significant transaction volume...
