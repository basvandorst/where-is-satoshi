I think what may happen is there will be an explosion in alt coins with each major company having their own for use for their site/services.  Almost like a rewards program but with an outside market to mine/trade them.  Eventually, consumers will grow weary of keeping track, and there will be consolodation among groups of corporations.  Some of these will be horizontal and some will be vertical across industries.

Relatively small and "mudane" uses like this is what will cause widespread adoption.  This can only increase demand for a finite resource with the expected effect on price.

Heh.  Well, it would be nice if you could pay for fuel and coffee with it at any random gas station.  The current kludges to move fiat around are insanely slow, such as a week (!) for an ACH transfer for instance.  CCs get their 1-2% for every purchase using them, so those charges are already factored into prices almost everywhere.

That's what it sounds like.  I'm not sure how else one would make "physical delivery of bitcoin".

What, they print out the wallet address and password, and snailmail it to you?
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:12:37
Ok.  Good luck with that.

Who would actually be buying at that price?  Or hell, even a tenth of that price?  I just don't see it.

The whole premise of this article is billionaires buying bitcoin to secure assets that can't be seized, which ultimately means that their ownership is secret.  How are they going to buy say a hundred million USD in BTC in an untraceable manner?  Fiat in that quantity comes from *somewhere*.
And yes, this applies to fiat as well in any sort of significant quantity.  Basically, big moves of any sort of financial instrument, be it crypto, gold, or cash, leaves a paper trail.

Someone with no BTC right now has to buy it.  That means getting fiat into the ecosystem somehow which, in any sort of quantity, means using an exchange.
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:20:19
BTC is, but the people who own it aren't.  At least, not in billionaire significant quantities.  Sure, you could maybe buy a few here and there via localbitcoin or similar, but you couldn't buy say tens of millions of USD that way.  My point is that in relatively small quantity, it can be anonymous.  In significant quantity, not so so much.  It's too much fiat to move.

No taxes are owed until they make a profitable sale.  Just buying and holding isn't a taxable event.  I just don't see how they could even do that in any sort of (billionaire significant) quantity without the fiat source being traced back to them.
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:45:12
In significant quantities, it is.  If you want to be able to interact with the wider financial ecosystem (i.e. banks, etc), it most certainly is.  If you want to buy in the black market in relatively low dollar amount, say less than $10k or so, you can maintain anonymity.  If you maintain anonymity, you *could* choose not to pay whatever your local government taxes on gains.

Which means that their government has a way to trace their ownership.  The premise is "unseizeable assets" and sure, they could move their BTC to a wallet and refuse to give up their keys.  They could also be jailed and fined for doing so.

After the price action the last two years, do you really think people won't be worried about buying very expensive bags?
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:34:25
There were also several orders of magnitude of money less traded at those points.
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:22:19
Ok, I am implicitly assuming the U.S., where no such tax exists now.
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:20:17
Yes, of course.  If you don't give up the keys, they can't take it.  However, if you owe taxes on it, they can apply threat of fines or imprisonment if you don't pay them.

The more governments that recognize at least the legitimacy of bitcoin, the better.  It can only spur adoption.  I would imagine that much cross-border trade, includining remittances, could be done via bitcoin.  The later alone could easily double the market cap of bitcoin.

Then why would BCH have dropped *more*?
@_date: 2019-01-25 19:59:09
As a function of time, yes.  In terms of USD trading volume, passed that milestone  a few hundred billion dollars ago.
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:54:29
Wish that were the case in the U.S.  I think there would be an explosion in trading the crypto pairs, and a significant decrease in trading fiat.
