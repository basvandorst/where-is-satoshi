I've been on the for a fortnight now, been good so far.
Had some rai blocks take longer than I was expecting to credit but that was addressed elsewhere. Got a bit laggy tonight as CAN released

Good article.

In my mind we need to shift towards a far less wasteful society, am I right in thinking an essentially deflationary economic model would promote this? I'm sick of everyone living outside their means, and an entire world promoting it

I've just chucked a coupla bucks on bittrex to game with, but I'm only trying to game the few alts that I would potentially diversify into anyway. If I buy in and don't see and immediate upswing, I'm just holding on to them for future me.

Me too. Did people lose their entire balance or part of? Because I'd briefly glanced at mine this morning and though ever so fleetingly that some number was off but didn't think twice about it, it wasn't 0.00 though

Looks really nice dude, simplicity is key. 
Any plans to include other currencies? I'd love to be able to see the price in AUD although I'm getting used to everything being USD in conversations

G'day cobber
I use hardblock quite a bit and it's been spot on, verification was pretty easy, 
I wanted to get onto btc markets too but the letter they sent out with my code didn't get to me in time and I haven't sorted out another yet

I use mycelium wallet atm for my meagre sums, will this be my play too?
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:26:19
My meagre stores are in a mycelium wallet, am I safe to just wait and watch with this?
