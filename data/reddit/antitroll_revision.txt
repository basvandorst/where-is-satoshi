Hello ***PHuSiOn9***
I've been programmed to remove all sarcasm, emotion, and trolling subtext from comments in order to rerepresent OP's main goal as accurately as possible. 
I would say that I would take your words into consideration, but I cannot.  I am not programmed any other way.  I do not feel.

The question I consider most relevant:  The project took a long time to complete, and in a space where technology causes rapid change, are there any more roadblock's you feel you might hit that could slow down public release?  I'm afraid that the documentary is becoming irrelevant. 
I'm not exactly aware of anything to do with the documentary industry, or how many hours of footage they might have, or the hurdles put up by film festivals (festivals that help raise awareness of the doc outside of places like Reddit and BitcoinTalk), but I still feel like my opinion was important.

The amount of risk taken in the crypto community is astounding.

Yes, but I'm fearful that the general public won't be able to use Bitcoin in it's current complex form.  While I understand the potential for Bitcoin's network to protect people from situations like the one above, I worry only brilliant people can really use it.  
Sometimes I forget that, like any software, Bitcoin has the ability to evolve and will become simpler over time.  But I've found that speaking in quips often gets me more attention and offers me the benefit of not having to construct real thoughts.

Bitcoin is a free market of free individuals acting in their own best interest.
I'm really worried that people might actually be swayed by the opinions expressed in some of the popular posts I'm seeing on the front page.  I know that there's no Bitcoin government to force me to do anything I don't want to, but I'm still scared of (what appears to be) the majority.
"All we need to do is buy X per day" or "All we need is everyone to buy junk they don't need to stimulate the bitcoin economy". I personally don't see eye-to-eye on this practice and feel that Bitcoin needs to evolve naturally.  We can't force change, and I feel the inevitable will happen regardless.
But sometimes the collective opinion frightens me.  I feel I must express this, as is also my right.
You're all completely entitled to your opinion, and by all means, keep posting.  But I'll be downvoting things I disagree with (as has always been the case).

While I have nothing to actually contribute to the discussion, I had a deep emotional connection to it that I couldn't articulate.  Instead of researching the topic to write a valid response, I went with my emotional reaction.  It was partly to get a reaction.  I find that writing short, quick responses saves me from putting myself in a position that could result in actual criticism, while at the same time I still come across hip and intelligent.

I don't feel it's difficult to secure Bitcoin wallets, even for technical users. I personally excel in it, and I tend to forget that other people don't know as much about this one single subject as I do. 
I know sometimes I come across like [Teddy from Pete and Pete](  I really don't mean to.  It's just that computer proficient people such as myself are often self-taught.  We've discovered things on our own, and have a chip on our shoulders when other people don't understand them.
Sometimes I also do it because it gives me a little rush.  I know its difficult to secure wallets,  I'm not stupid.  I use this to elevate myself a bit because I was insulted and belittled by my peers growing up.  I use the same belittling techniques on others, even though I know I shouldn't.

Or it can go the same way as other coins with mining bubbles which is collapse.  You have no idea and neither do I.  But its happened before with other coins under similar circumstances, but that's not what I'm really trying to say.  
The truth is, I have an [unhealthy obsession](
Being obsessed over anything is unhealthy.  But my obsession isn't constructive.  I spend the vast majority of my day talking about Bitcoin.  It's in no way productive (although sometimes I delude myself into believing I'm shining *truth* in the faces of delusional Bitcoiners).  
I'm destructive.  I speak negatively for hours on end about one single subject.  I work tirelessly as a contrarian in hopes of gaining any minimal amount of attention.  I could have chosen sports, science, or politics. But I chose Bitcoin.
There's a poster of Christopher Nolan's Joker above my bed because ever since seeing that movie, I've believed that his random and chaotic nature is cool.  No one can track him.  No one can peg him as anything.  He's chaos.  I desperately want to be that thing.  
But I'm not.  I'm a shell of it.  I'm a clone of an idea.  My attempts to uncategorized myself stuff me into an easily labeled box.
So I sit, day in and day out, for what is easily an unhealthy amount of time, criticizing a single subject.  I don't expand on my points.  I don't give too much information otherwise others are prone to real debate.  I want my mark on the world to hurt, and I do it to give myself meaning because I'm unable to make a mark in a meaningful way.

Now I'll be able to pay for porn with a digital currency that makes me uneasy due to my own lack of understanding!  Instead of researching it, though, I use sarcasm as a mask.  I crave attention online because my introverted personality offline causes me to lash out passive-aggressively.
I hope to be viewed by my peers online as the snarky digital loner, dropping short opinionated quips to display intellectual superiority.  But I risk nothing emotionally by contributing no true value.  This way, I'm never in a position to sound wrong.

I've mentioned this before, but it worries me that Bitcoin has become a cult.  The religious iconography seen in this image juxtaposed to Bitcoin is distressing to me.

So you just took a 6% pay cut in the last 24 hours?  That's rough.  But don't worry, if you honestly believe in the technology, it should even out.  I personally don't, but don't let that be indicative of how things will actually play out.  Oh wait, do you mean to say you still just get paid in fiat and convert it all to Bitcoin (I was confused), because we're all aware right now that Bitcoin fluctuates too much to as a constant conversion to fiat.

I heard Circle is locking your money!  I'd like to say first, I'm sorry about the trouble their service is causing you.  I'll cross my fingers that Circle allows you to transfer your balance.  Assuming that's the case, you should use a wallet on your local machine (or phone) if it's a large amount, as it is supported in every country.  I might also suggest HD wallets for safety.
