No, the reason it doesn't work is its difficult to acquire information that's easily gathered from market prices.  Economists have derived the efficient competitive equilibrium in the 1950s.

SS payments are given COLA annually according to the CPI (CPI-W).  In addition, ad hoc increases have also been applied at various times.

Two things. One is that we did make changes to SSI payments during those years.  And second is that they are  adjusted directly by CPI by default. So I'm not sure what you mean by 'based on'. SS is adjusted directly by CPI.
I really don't know what you are saying as by law SS is indeed adjusted by CPI measure of inflation.  Even more. They are adjusted by CPI- W which isn't simply inflation of price of what we buy but it's indexed by what we earn. 
In other words, 


We do.

Actually, in the first quarter of 2009 there was deflation, and indeed because of the sudden drop in investment, the money supply contracted rapidly.  
The CPI is used to make COLA, and while regional and industry differences in prices may occur, the CPI is quite good for that.  
Maybe I'm not following your point in saying CPI is not COLA, but the COLA in this case is indeed based on the change in CPI.  
You can argue that senior costs have risen faster than CPI for various reasons, but the comment was that the SSI doesn't adjust for increases in prices.  It actually increases faster than that becUse of the use of the CPI-W.  In other words, it uses changes in wages rather than prices which over the long term exceeds inflation in consumer prices.  
You are providing a link to a site that uses the CPI to calculate inflation.

Ultimately, that's required of a centrally planned economy, though.  Individuals are told what to do with resources.  I guess I interpreted your comment as meaning the Stalinist system to be more susceptible to wealth concentration.

Uh... How do you have $10k to spend?  Won't your parents be upset?

Changing the currency doesn't relate to the quality of what we produce.  It sounds like you are confusing the real value with the nominal.  These are separate issues.  If the currency we use is deflationary, then it affects when we spend, not the quality of what we buy. 
There are some cool things that can be done with a hashtag. I'm just not agreeing that it's an issue related to the inflation/deflation rate of that medium of exchange.

I would buy that better fan regardless of what I'm using to pay for it.

I don't know about that.  Money isn't the issue, but rather the allocation of resources.  Was the Stalinist system more susceptible to this than the western capitalist economies? I don't know.

Perhaps we don't want to have a consumer driven economy, so this is a mixed bag.  Or perhaps we want people to make better choices with what they choose to consume (and therefore produce). 
But more importantly is this would mean *investors* will wait for higher returns before investing money in assets. This is bad.  It disincentivizes investment, not simply 
Consumption.  This is largely the problem with any deflationary currencies.


And how is this different from now?  


This is a mixed bag.  It reduces costs of exchange, so if I want to buy a bond in the UK but only have dollars, I first have to find a person looking to exchange pounds for dollars.  This was the hope of unifying the European currencies under the euro.  Then again, monetary policy is one of the two macroeconomic tools we have for smoothing the business cycle.  Without a fiscal union, a monetary union hamstrings a countries ability to get out of demand driven recessions.  
I do like the other technologies you bring up.  I don't think an easier car registry system for transfering ownership is a bad idea at all. I'm not sure why bitcoin is related here other than the premise is built on the same hashtag model.

I already linked twice to the SS Webpage where it talks about indexing of SS payments.  Yes, I was being sloppy in distinguishing between different forms of SS payments.  But I just don't follow the statement that SS isn't indexed automatically.  There is an annual adjustment written into law whereby those payments are increased based on CPI-W. 
So when you say that SS payments don't increase with inflation, are you saying that because you don't think CPI-W is sufficiently covering actual COL changes?

Look at the Econ Nobel prize last year - financial markets are efficient...and they are not efficient. Most contrasting shared award in a while.
