That's a whole lot of Bette Midler pics there, bud.
EDIT:  Oh that's just "related gifs". I was thinking it was your album, lol.

Can you donate 1 mill to the "me hating having a job" fund? I mean, all I need in life is my internet connection, I'll spend the rest on my kids I swear.

I got a big chunk of money 2 days after last month's dip to ~1800. I said "soon as that fucker dips sub 2k again I'm buying!"

Steam takes bitcoin, and you can pay your Dish Network bill with bitcoin. The Gap, JCPenny, Gamestop, Subway. I guarantee some of those are near you. "Worthless to the average consumer" is already less than accurate and we're just getting started.

You're really missing the point. Since you seem to keep asking the same question I'll answer you. No, you can't get groceries or buy gas with it *yet*. But the list of *very common stores that a lot of people shop at* should at least give you a hint that bitcoin, while still in it's infancy, is on the way to being accepted everywhere.

That's my second biggest hope for bitcoin.

Wish I woulda seen the 5.6 dip last night around 10pm! But I bought $100 worth his morning at about 6.2.

Leaving BoA (and banks all together) and switching to a good local credit union was the best thing I ever did. You get exactly the same services, done better and with zero of the scam bullshit. Freaking night and day difference. I don't see a single excuse for anyone to ever use a bank instead of a credit union.
