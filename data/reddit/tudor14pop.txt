it's like when driving...if is speeder goes by you with 200 mph, he's a maniac but if someone in front goes regularly he's an old lady. Of course you're the best driver

Stop using 'bitcoin core' please. There is no 'core' in bitcoin. There is a cash in bitcoin cash but no core as in 'bitcoin core'. Just use Bitcoin when you refer to Bitcoin :) Thank you

There was a presentation live in San Francisco about 5 hours ago on a NEO conference and they spoke there. I watched the event from youtuber Boxmining but he hasn't uploaded any video yet. Expect a link by tomorrow or 2 days

I do software at work so yeah it's never 100% finished. Probably there were many things left out and many bugs, but the game just "seemed" to be 100% done when actually is really "good enough" or "acceptable" experience to be sold. Ask every software company on the planet why are they releasing updates after updates?

how do I start a LN node on mainnet?

ETH is actually a platform for building dapps. Think of Android :)

The FUD is that and nothing more. I'm not really impressed anymore in that. If the technology progressed when it was at 1$ then at 10$ and survived market crashes then I think it's reasonable to assume that people will work on it as long as they want. Also most of them I think work on it because of their passion and want to create a better world for everyone else they would have stopped at the first crash so I'm really bullish on this

If it hits 0$ I will buy everything :) and if crashes 90% I will buy at 1k as much as I can

That is correct. The size would grow extremely slow. Blocksize increase would not be required anytime soon. Multisig(as I understand it) is a different fish and is 100% separated from this improvement. The reduction in size, just modifies the transactions and how they are handled...the signing is another story but I see no reason for incompatibility. The question is, can be implemented without a hard fork? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:45:21
haha. Soon friend, soon

Also there is the question: if it's already at 160GB, can we start from scratch? or if we implement it by tomorrow will be 160GB + really slow growth over time?
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:14:21
It is true, but someone needs to implement it. All the details on how it works are in the paper

Oh cool! I didn't knew that but sounds like Monero guys are ahead
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:19:07
yes. But if implemented tomorrow, the size would grow really slow from then on. I'm not sure if we could replace the existing size with one of 17GB. I hope someone has an answer to this

While total privacy sounds interesting I think the design was for sure to be a public blockchain so it's more easy to go mainstream. It gives transparency and that's a good thing for new tech. I believe that we might migrate to full privacy in the future but only after BTC is mainstream

there aren't enough jails for all. They could make an example of some though. Satoshi was smart for keeping it anonymous or else would have been in trouble by now

how you ban mining? they can't ban GPU/PC/CPU sells because would mean to ban technology. They could only ban big miners(by going to their location and closing them) which would just incentivise small miners to buy 1-2 GPU's and start mine which would create more decentralisation.

also browsers usually come with extensions which are vulnerable to hacks so might be better off with downloaded client
