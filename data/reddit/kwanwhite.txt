Thank you great answer :)
But i have also read and actually seen websites that offer services for coin mixing and such; are they reliable or scams that just take bitcoins?

Wow Great answer! That really is helpful to add about scams and theft. Do you know any fake websites that do such?

What are some alternatives where i can safely sell cryptos for fiat and hold the usd or eur without them being at risk?
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:28:36
No not really, i just needed general information and knowledge on the matter to add to --- and thoroughly explain --- my methodology project. Thank you much appreciated :)

Great answer!
How do I create a pgp and how do i use it in case of a paper wallet?
On bitaddress i tried and typed random characters just to get the idea and it has presented me with the private and public qr and codes but where does the pgp fill in with all of this and how do i receive and send (meaning the decryption process)?
Plus do i store the 25 keywords on the same paper or...?
Sorry for the many questions i appreciate your help!

Do you have any idea of any amounts have been frozen for any reason of a dispute of some sort?
What i don't get is why can't i order more than one btc per transaction

I just checked coinmama and every time i type down to buy 0.02 or 0.03 it automatically changes to 0.2
I don't understand what the problem is, but i'll be checking the sites you recommended thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:29:26
Do i need to go through a verification process and such? Or can i just buy bitcoins without all that like i do with other exchanges?
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:09:27
The problem is with the so many reviews that seem to say the app is a scam and that it stole their money. I'm not going anywhere near that app.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:36:29
Great!! Do you happen to know anything about the fees??

I have read it. My question is more concerned with reviews and feedback and experience rather than technical.
