the only issue i have with xapo is their conversion rate for display of wallet funds... I should have 4.47$ and it shows 4.41$. WHY?? i can't understand this. Let me know if you guys experience the same. Several customers of mine have the same issue.

hi max,
do you know if there are any plans for multi-sig wallets on localbitcoins?
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:55:50
this keeps coming up. look at this thread from last week: 
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:04:45
other large exchanges have no problem with clients that trade on localbitcoins too.
@_date: 2015-12-05 02:25:26

I totally missed this. Thanks. You can then spend the colored coins you have on that store on a larger bitcoin buy also.
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:30:19
No, anywhere in the world. An exchange needs those documents for AML/KYC compliance.

This should be way more visible
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:40:29
You are missing the point. The code for the exchange is open source so anyone can build an exchange wherever they want. The place where the main authors of the code decide to base theirs is irrelevant.

while everything you just said is true, it is also impractical for day to day  use.
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:03:10
totally agree. that's why online and cash buys usually have different spreads. i was mostly talking about the online buys.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:10:22
Yeah this is a clever solution, but it adds the "burden" of paper wallets. i'm sure there's something involving only the wallets of the users that can be done.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:08:13
If the business owner is part of a conglomerate of businesses that wish to give store credit to their costumers and don't have a shared database they would need something on the client side. Many times clients have a "membership card" with that info.

yeah it has some 20 addresses for each kind of cryptocurrency, not only bitcoin is affected.
@_date: 2014-11-04 15:41:46
is it possible/legal/functional to install something like this on a standard PoS? I imagine there would need to be some integration with the PoS software, or the salesperson would have to register it as a cash purchase, although that might complicate accounting at the end of the day.
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:44:39
If the community doesn't agree with the "controlled development network" they just have to move to another side chain where they feel "safe". There's no conflict of interest when miners determine the level of trust on the code of the network.

I doubt there is any interest to non bitcoin advocate traders to give discounts over 2% on bitcoin purchases though...
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:30:46
I have.
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:53:57
yeah this will probably push the localbitcoins spread to 3% in the mid term.
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:31:41
you can, if the other people you transfer from/to use bitcoin too. You cannot simply use bitcoin on one side and paypal on the other.
@_date: 2014-11-08 17:25:50
they seem to have a bigger spread over bitreserve (1%-2% vs 0.45%). but they pay for the transaction mining fees which is cool. making that spread less variable would be nice. 2 solutions, now we just need the wallets to implement them :)
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:21:38
so much this. the "over market" value on localbitcoins is what you pay for not having to link bank accounts. you either take the time and expose your personal data for market value bitcoins, or pay for your privacy.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:32:36
that was a good read. I wonder, if steps repeat themselves in europe, what is the next step? the roman empire got captured by barbarians... what about us?
right now we are in the spot where freedoms are getting lost to pay state debt. small deflation is incoming. I really wonder what is next...
@_date: 2014-11-09 12:21:09
you misunderstood me then. I want the best of both worlds, a decentralized electronic wallet/payment service with low fees that I can pay in USD with. Right now, you either have a decentralized service with bitcoin, or centralized USD wallets with high fees.
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:11:40
when you have a way to get grandma into bitcoin, you will have done it. she has no incentive to do her grocery or meds shopping in bitcoin, even if the merchants accepted it and her retirement was paid on bitcoin.
Employers is just one of many sources bitcoin needs to get to mass market.
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:18:32
that has always been the problem... but if they hate the service and there's a better one, switch. at least use the service you hate only for the transactions that really need to be done there.
@_date: 2014-11-09 12:30:29
Nice! Yesterday i kept thinking on the services available and i wondered why keep reserves of the currencies when you could simply keep reserves of the bitcoin amounts that correspond to the currencies. the only downside i saw was if the bitcoin value dips in the meantime, but long term the company should make profit. this way you can use multi-sig on your wallet and it's just a matter of interface for the other currencies. love it, will pay attention

@_date: 2014-11-08 18:36:52
sure, that's one way to solve the problem, but then you need a new cryptocurrency to be pegged to each fiat currency or asset. besides, you are doing trade offs on several bitcoin features to achieve the peg to USD. maybe with side-chains this can be feasible solution to decentralize the "money cards" that bitreserve and locks use atm, but until then using several cryptocurrencies like this for business seems like a nightmare.

an important difference is difficulty gradually increases (since 3 months ago) while an halving is more immediate. I still think large miners have already priced this into their forecasts though.

@_date: 2017-03-11 12:07:22
Maybe i didn't explain myself properly: they don't allow your wallet to send funds that require conversion anymore. you get locked out of their system if you try to game them. then you can only withdraw your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:39:41
They don't (can't) stop those users and probably lock those wallets from conversion. they don't lose any value that way.
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:14:03
fwiw you should look into the physical delivery exception, which is what Abra is legally using to cover their ass with multisig contracts :) they done the legal work for you.

there are better graphs that i can't find right now. but here's one of the big "pools": 
@_date: 2016-01-08 17:40:10
my bank has recently told me that i can't accept transfers related to bitcoin, or they will terminate my account. This all happened after the EU rulings on money laundering/terrorism financing after the Paris attacks... There is a huge lack of information to the legacy financial system about bitcoin and how these activities can be tracked (for now).
I worry that as we move towards more confidential transactions bitcoin becomes even more of an issue for the same reasons.
I would love for someone in the know to write some non-biased article about this that we could discuss.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:00:38


I wonder how many it will... from what we have seen so far, only applications that require transactions benefit from a trustless network like bitcoin, and even many of them do not.
With the recent news of R3, T0 and other blockchain (the append-only log, not the PoW + DB) companies moving out of bitcoin's network, what interesting use cases are there?
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:00:34
most of the miners. usually a pool is just one huge ass miner.

Once they make the global update, yes. right now you can only switch between USD and PPesos.
@_date: 2016-06-08 08:49:38
they will ask documents for your current living address. International wire transfers might work... i can't do them to my personal account or i get double taxed. but to an exchange, might work.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:52:22
Watch the video on the top comment.
You can convert USD to BTC (and vice-versa) inside the app and process the withdrawal.
You can meet anyone with any currency other than yours and trade with them within the app. You can send anyone money, you just need their phone number, so you can send remotely, as a remittance.
@_date: 2016-06-08 08:50:34
That's interesting, might try it then.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:49:43
watch the video on the top post. that will be a very common use case. the answer is yes.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:54:42
If those holders are long on bitcoin they believe they will eventually earn more than they lose, so they accept the risk.
I had this same idea last year when i first heard of abra. really glad they came to implement it, abra sounded limited at first.

@_date: 2016-12-01 20:17:20
no, they don't. because colored coins aren't needed for that. any colored-coins project can be replaced by bitcoin + a database.
they just built a decentralized, p2p exchange for all types of assets where bitcoin is the token being swapped and their server is the asset price oracle.
I'll agree with you, on first impression lykke looks better. Quality is more subjective though.
Both seem to have the same purpose.
@_date: 2016-11-25 02:04:32
what are you afraid of in PSD2? i don't get it from your comment on that thread.
the only point it touches is on payment instituitions (like exchanges) being required to comply with AML if they hold customers funds.
sounds like this article is saying the same.
EDIT: also, keep in mind virtual currencies are never mentioned in PSD2.
A bitcoin only payment service will not have to register as a payments institution on this directive alone. If they do apply, they may need to adhere to all rules, as in payments being reversible, etc.
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:21:34
None of them. the token is basically destroyed.
A colored coin aware wallet might implement this behaviour in different ways though, e.g. the change output keeps the token.
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:54:37
can you be more specific? there is no such screen to buy btc with btc.
you click buy btc, you get taken to a list of offers for your selected currency. you choose one offer and continue to pay with Sepa.

out of context that looks golden.
@_date: 2019-08-30 00:55:31
This is correct, however it falls under the failure to disclose your activity to the tax authority. don't abuse it.
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:39:28
they charge 0.00015 for incoming txs, so it's not much different in the end.
@_date: 2016-11-04 12:14:16
It makes it so the bitcoincore wallet is usable in SPV mode until the blockchain is fully downloaded and synced.
Right now you have to wait for the whole sync to be able to use the wallet.

Oh please do give us an example of such a claim. nice source you have...
The information of the Tax Authority explains that it's a means of payment, not an asset, therefore it can't be taxed as an asset.
The trading activity can be taxed if it is your job. If you just mine or trade sporadically there is no income tax for the individual.

actually, it can't be considered capital gains (mais valias), because it was never a currency or an asset. that's what they are clarifying here. you won't find a single claim of someone making a withdraw from an exchange and getting taxed for capital gains. Also, capital gains are always 28%, only IRS goes up to 50%.
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:09:37
my comment counts only for cryptocurrency swaps available in the US, the synthetic currencies. As Bill commented, they don't offer etf/stocks products to US. they don't keep your funds and the contract is on a blockchain, not their database, so they have nothing to respond to.

putting some realism into all this hype, public conversation on irc a couple days ago:
&lt;gmaxwell&gt; There are no privacy features being worked on in the bitcoin protocol right now that I'm aware of.
&lt;gmaxwell&gt; riclas: the efforts to deploy schnorr, in so far as they've go so far, don't include aggregation
&lt;riclas&gt; i didn't quite understand what would mast or taproot do after... i thought it added some masking of the script
&lt;gmaxwell&gt; riclas: from a privacy perspective, not much.  They make non-executed exceptional cases private, but only if you don't execute them.

@_date: 2015-08-14 12:02:05
You would only need to require that information for large amounts (&gt;15000€ in my country) to comply with AML laws.
EDIT: in the US this is not true, since you are an MSB, thus required to collect id information for any trade.
@_date: 2015-08-01 02:32:30
I doubt bitcoin ATMs won't have to comply to KYC for much longer
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:40:28
all exchanges/custody providers will need to request this information when AMLD5 is transposed to the respective country.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:02:02
I'm in europe, but that is irrelevant, replace the 15000€ for 1000$.
Ok, a bitcoin exchange is an MSB so you need to collect personal information for trades of any amount in the US. I'll edit
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:45:16
Yes, I am. you can move your funds at will with your wallet. all you are trusting abra to do is be legit with their oracle for the value of the assets you have contracted.

On Abra you buy through their partners, the process should be easier, but you are trusting Abra with your money, just like on an exchange.
On Bisq you buy to one of the available traders, the platform gives an arbitrator for the trade.
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:31:55
yeah. that's the best place for cash trades. good luck finding partners there though... doubt you get much better deals than atms
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:41:30
weird timing for this question, when we don't even have PRs for these features.
@_date: 2016-02-20 23:26:30
it might be if it is insured... i'm not sure how that works though. still, the only change to coinbase is that you would be able to move crypto at any time, your fiat would still be controlled and could be restrained.
@_date: 2016-02-03 02:21:05
these guys are also getting several ATMs to the asian market. and they do have the mining, so they are protected from being called a ponzi (even though they are one in the long run).

completely different. you can buy btc through both, probably easier on Abra.
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:14:15
yes bisq has fiat trades with any currency, as long as there are sellers/buyers advertising for them.

the problem is who controls your fiat money to be exchanged in real time. for crypto this is not a problem, shapeshift has done it. for fiat exchanges need to hold it, as if they were a bank.
@_date: 2016-09-05 12:03:18
that will be very far in the future... many libraries will need to be ported.
@_date: 2016-09-03 18:38:49
Yes i know of tether. But it uses a token that may become worthless, even if supposedly there are full reserves.
Those reserves are also the reason for the heavy layer of KYC/AML, which could be avoided if the service was backed by btc, from my understanding.
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:26:19
all transactions in bitsquare are also secured by bitcoin security. Or give a concrete example where they aren't

Hi! There's not much of a community in the city. There's an ongoing effort to try and do a nice meetup at the start of the year.
I go to Lisbon once or twice a week for other things but we can have a drink sometime.

are there wallets that use bcoin?
you mention bitcoinj being unusable/unmaintained in other posts, maybe bcoin would be a good replacement for the existing bitcoinj wallets? Most of them even have their own version of bitcoinj...
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:24:33
You need to have those goods and sell them first to drive the price down.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:10:53
opinion piece though
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:42:12
We have talked about this at length in the past.
with growth we will see how this scheme fares. I do not have a better solution without KYC, and maybe "heaven" was a bit too harsh, but as a fiat trader i feel reluctant to use the platform with the current scheme. sorry manfred
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:34:34
I'm totally against segwit2x, but their approach seems in  touch with history, i.e. regarding the chain with most proof of work as bitcoin. I expect this response from most signers.
Why are we as users changing the narrative of what is BTC as we see fit?
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:48:39
is the man :) 15yo wizard
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:12:38
they seem to imply there are 0day bugs in core 0.15.x, which would be harmful to disclose in public. Rather convenient
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:49:07
they don't. it's heaven for bank account phishers.
edit: i meant fiat sellers are not fully protected. buyers are.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:47:35
right? the language is not clear that it is 4 sets of 250 btc. at first it read to me like 250 only, but the spirit of the bet was a 1 for 1 trade, so i guess it is 1000 btc total.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:24:10

But if miners support segwit2x as they seem to, won't that be the longest proof-of-work chain?
If miners are able to subjugate the users, i think the bitcoin experiment has failed. But it seems a consequence of following the longest chain, like the whitepaper reads, and like we defended the XT attack.

I have wondered about this tradeoff for a long time.
Has there been any discussion on the conclusions of arthur's work?
is something like this deployable on a soft fork (changing average new block time)? i don't think so... seems a pity.
@_date: 2016-10-28 23:00:00
But a tamper proof record keeping system was possible before blockchains were a thing... no? Can it be that something so much more complex like bitcoin had to surface for these companies to think about that kind of system?
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:01:12
worse part is their ID verification sucks and is easily forged. Been asking about better id verification for a year now...
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:53:44
bitcoin's scripting language doesn't allow for other applications other than financial ones. ethereum does.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:06:37
you still have the financial escrow as a trusted entity, and most of the work would be on the financial institution that takes on the ordeal of complying with regulation. I would say a close implementation of the crypto currency side of what you are thinking is something like bisq.io
@_date: 2016-10-06 12:54:03
@_date: 2016-10-10 11:56:36
Did arthur not consider centralization pressure in his security parameters?
I would love to see some discussion on this work, as it provides a testbed where these parameters can be included, if not there.
If a smaller block interval provides mostly the same properties, why should we not support it?
@_date: 2015-11-15 13:41:05
of course. my point is you can get "clean" private transactions with joins, if that's what you want. i'm sure other services won't care and accept blacklisted coins.
@_date: 2016-10-16 01:30:26
with bank account you can.
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:03:15
My bank is worried about transactions i receive while selling bitcoin since they could be linked to money laundering. If only I could get their compliance office to read this article...
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:21:29
depends if the platform makes it possible to ask for ID... Bitsquare doesn't (yet), because there's not much volume.
Localbitcoins evolved to add that option since fraud increased massively with use.
@_date: 2015-11-29 14:31:40
i don't. but if i'm receiving a transaction from someone who does, i have to wait. especially if RBF becomes default opt-in, most users won't bother to change it.
@_date: 2015-11-29 02:57:20
any kind of in person usage is done with 0-conf. now with rbf that will change... It really sucks waiting in front of someone because now you can't trust them.
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:55:44




has this been discussed? as I understand the main purpose is to replace transactions with a higher fee.


can you direct me to any write ups on this?
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:56:15
in case someone from Abra wanders around:
What are the regulatory concerns of your service?
I suppose none for Abra Send (since the user controls the wallet keys) and usual KYC and AML for Abra Pay.
If that is the case, what is stopping you from launching your wallet with Abra Send right now? It could support all currencies that your oracle does already, and continue an incremental adoption, even without tellers for currencies of countries where AML and KYC isn't ready for Abra Pay.
Great job anyway.
@_date: 2015-11-15 12:58:23
I would guess future mixing services can take into account blacklisted coins and ask the user if he cares about mixing with them
@_date: 2016-10-02 19:42:28
simplicity for one, no keys, no addresses, just a phone number.
second, bank transfers, partnerships with networks of retailers for tellers.
third, you control the keys, not coinapult or whatever locks service
@_date: 2015-11-29 14:29:50
with the first-seen rule you would wait until you saw the transaction and you were 98+% sure it wasn't possible to double-spend. Now double spending is a feature.
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:25:21
That's an interesting point. Right now bitsquare uses the trade limit as a way to avoid scammers. If it grows, fraud increases and sellers will want KYC or abandon it. However, how is the ID handled in that scenario? It is decentralized, so it's not a honeypot of IDs like regular exchanges.
If bitsquare introduces an option to add an ID check, i think it is more secure for the customer data than a regular exchange, and the spread will decrease with growth.
@_date: 2015-10-07 11:50:29
a post like this was needed long ago when this whole discussion about bitcoin's development rules started. thanks for doing this.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:16:09
you miss the point of zero-knowledge and real world scenarios. only a small subset of transactions can be done with computer verifiable information.
@_date: 2016-05-26 15:46:33
It can. Right now both participants in the trade have to manually confirm the trades, but eventually validation through blockchains should be a thing.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:17:41
So you would only have a problem if you announced to the regulator that you are using that illegal currency...
@_date: 2016-05-12 00:57:19
right now i don't have a business setup in Angola to sell BTC, but a lot of customers like yours waiting for one.
@_date: 2015-10-23 18:14:00
and the localbitcoins scene is pretty big down there.
@_date: 2015-11-14 01:30:54
I've had this happen to me from phishing scammers and to other traders that I know of from ebay-like traders.
This is why you should have KYC rules as a trader and not accept purchases from accounts in another person's name.
This community likes to spread the no-KYC gospell, but if it is not for those documents, there is no defense for traders of fiat to digital.
@_date: 2016-05-12 22:18:26

They have a really good service in Europe too.

Your questions only prove that the dude sold bitcoin, it doesn't prove he was being scammed by a third party.
@_date: 2015-10-20 01:26:54
on the other hand, why is this better than a specialized infinispan (or any replicated, distributed database)?
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:40:31
i suppose they will integrate with skrill then, having bought them. This means you can now buy paysafecards easily with bitcoin, which can be used in League of Legends for example, which had no way of buying game money for bitcoin, from a good while back, until now.
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:39:38
if you are portuguese there are localbitcoins.com sellers with similar prices (me and another guy) who cover 3 banks for near instant purchases (CGD, BCP and NB).
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:42:18
correct me if i'm wrong, but then whenever the servers that store their blockchain get hacked, that blockchain gets leaked and it becomes similar to bitcoin, without the permissionless. Kind of the point andreas was making on his devcore talk...
