So saying cash will stay around for the next 100 years is more delusional than saying cash will die in the next few years? Yeah you’re delusional too.

Cash is tied deeply into the banking system, and people think banking is just gonna go up in smokes in 50 years? Cash has just started its evolution into "cashless," digital versions, and its got a long way to go. I really don't understand anyone that says crypto is going to replace cash. Why can't they live side-by-side, each with its own usage? People who want crypto to immediately replace cash are gamblers that just wanna get rich quick.

Anyone that says “cash is dead” is delusional. Cash is not going anywhere for at least the next few generations.

I symphatize with your loss. I am not sure I understand how this works since swapping a “sim card to a device” does not exist in my country. Does this only apply to sim cards and or devices locked to a specific carrier in America?

Thanks for sharing but what exactly is your point in announcing this to the world? While I respect your decision, is it wise to put all your eggs in one basket?

He was taken aback that it's all recorded on a distributed ledger? Is he sure he's a head of an investment company? That should be the very first fact that anyone that reads the simplest article on crypto remembers.
