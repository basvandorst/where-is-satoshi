I love how people assume BTC is somehow independent of he infrastructure it’s built on. I would’ve assumed the SegWit incident would’ve proved the existence of influential agents within the system.
BTC is about as separate from state influence as the internet is.

Yes Japan has the most volume now, and yes I gave you an article from earlier in the year rather than give you data for the last 30 days. Why is that I wonder? Maybe it’s because the Chinese government made a recent decision concerning its citizens’ use of Bitcoin prompting my question in the first place. Why don’t you send me a link telling me the time and date while you’re at it.
If China reverses it’s decision and decides to even subsidize the currency, can it begin to influence BTC monetary policy? That’s the question. The answers I’m getting are equivalent to “Bitcoin is great”. Can you identify why the currency goes up or down? “It just does” or “decentralization” aren’t answers.

China is trying to control their people not the price of Bitcoin. If it did, it would employ other methods, the question is, if they did, would it make a difference? Recent events don’t make a case either way since there’s no evidence of any state ever intentionally attempting to change crypto prices

You can’t think of monetary policy in terms of crypto in the same way you think of the monetary policy of hard cash since the “supply” can only increase (unless you fork, which you wouldn’t want to do since you couldn’t do it every time you wanted to make a change). 
You’d probably focus more on liquidity and trading volume.

I think you may not have been around for early days of the web. The prevailing narrative was that it is a stateless platform of freedom. Lawrence Lessig’s claim to fame was writing a whole book proving it an inaccurate assumption.
My bias is simply weighted more to observation than theory. I don’t assume Bitcoin acts in a vacuum, it hasn’t proved independence since it’s fluctuations have coincided with political activity. When SegWit became SegWit 2 it further illustrated the existence of agency and leverage among members of the network.
I’m not making my assumptions based on existing network structures, so I’m not assuming Bitcoin is like any other currency or network. I understand it’s its own thing and has its own unique characteristics. However, with time those characteristics are becoming clearer and independence isn’t one of them.

Again you live by your theory over any evidence on the contrary. The price is up so everything’s great and working beautifully. It’s downvoted to oblivion because this subreddit is either BTC loyalists, hobbyists or clueless speculators who don’t know or care how things actually function. The prevailing culture is sales driven, sell the dream rather then actually analyze it. I should do more research? Where would I even do that? Again the “research” is either purely technical (how big should the blocks be etc) or mostly sales driven (funds with positions in BTC saying how valuable it’s going to be). There’s literally no legit models of BTC behavior available publicly. How is it actually being used and what drives the price? 
Monetary policy whatever that is: what do you call SegWit? An update? Yeah the fed does updates to USD too.

If China owns potentially 20%-30% of BTC and makes up 50%-98% of trade volume what does that new node look like?

Has the decisions of the Chinese government ever effected the price of BTC?

Theory and practice are two different things. We also believed the internet was a stateless decentralized platform.
