Maybe I'm insane... but I think we could decentralize the funding and construction of roads to a consensus system where smart contracts setup the tender/bidding system... and citizens can directly point out their concerns and requirements without central authority...

Do people really fall for this?
Folks at JPM, GS, or any other bank do this shit all the time, making statements or screwing around with ratings to influence prices and get better deals.

That's rather myopic.
If you want technology to get better, you need competing variations. We don't know what the future holds, and maybe a variation of the bitcoin algorithm survives those conditions better.
Also that's just inaccurate. Ethereum serves a larger purpose than being a mere tradable coin. Many of these 'coins' you hear about aren't intended to be cryptocurrency, but rather a digital stake in a new company/product. These are launched (ICO'd) through ethereum, which allows you to design smart contracts that basically run your currency/token/organization.

Pretty safe, unless you live here in India where they demonetized equivalents of $10 and $20 bills.

It's for that hypothetical grandma purchasing obscure Venezuelan cryptocurrency, because that's a common occurrence.
