I fail to see what is so unbelievable. People kill themselves every day. It's a dark fact of life and I doubt I know a single person who hasn't had the thought cross their mind at some point in their lives. We live in a complicated and fucked up world.

I keep hoping I'll wake up and realize it's not.

I highly doubt he would appreciate that, but I'll consider it once I'm a little more clear headed.

After hearing the news a few hours ago I immediately called my best friend, who I knew had about 900 btc stuck on gox. He knew they were probably insolvent and had been acting extremely distraught and detached,  as if someone close to him had died. He didn't answer his cell phone which isn't like him so I called his wife to make sure he was ok. I could tell by her voice that she hadn't heard the latest news. She went out to their detached workshop to give him the phone and just started screaming. Primal screams that will haunt me forever. She tried to form words between her screams and tears but couldn't. She didn't have to say anything. I knew my friend was dead. She hung up and I jumped in my car and sped to their home. When I got there she was on the workshop floor with his body. He used a shotgun. She was trying to put his head back together. Blood and brain matter was everywhere. There was no hope of saving him. But she wouldn't give up. I grabbed her and hugged her. We stood there hugging and sobbing until a few minutes later when a fire truck and ambulance arrived, followed by police. I am devastated.  I don't know what to do with myself.  I feel like I should be doing something but I don't know what. I feel helpless. There's nothing I can do and it's killing me. I know the images in my head will haunt me forever. He was my best friend in the world.    
To anyone out there reading this who also lost money due to gox PLEASE don't turn this disaster into a tragedy. You WILL get through this. You are stronger than this. I wish I had the perfect words to convince you that this too shall pass. I don't.  Just be strong. I swear you will come out of this a stronger person. Please- hug your loved ones every day. I love you all.

Assume what you'd like, I didn't come here to convince everyone. No offense taken for the doubt. Skepticism is healthy. If this happened to someone else I might not believe them either, I can't say. And yeah my username probably doesn't help but that's what I consider what mtgox did- a con.

This may be true. He did make an attempt about 5 or 6 years ago after a brutal breakup with a girl he was completely in love with. I feel extremely guilty right now. I should have known this was a possibility. But he swore to me he'd never do this and I was apparently naive about the nature of his mental issues.    


He was only married for a little over a year (we're both 28) and they decided to keep their finances seperate due to past drug problems of hers that ruined her first marriage (she's 4 years clean now). She has her own bank account that he would deposit money into every month. She knew he owned bitcoin but the whole topic bored her. All she really knew was that he had enough in savings to live comfortably. He invested his savings last year, which was actually a settlement for an injury he received which makes it extremely hard for him to do much work now. Luckily he also bought their house with some of it so she will get to keep it. But everything else is gone. Including him now.

Others have pointed out that if he were to be confirmed as a "death by bitcoin" or some nonsense the media would turn it into a circus, and that's the last thing his wife needs, so I can't give you his name. We called him Muggs in high school. He was a good man.

Thank you. That helps more than you know.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:12:17
Thank you for the kind words. I'm beginning to regret ever making the post. I'm trying to prepare myself for calling his mother in the next hour... any advice? I'm not sure if she's been notified yet
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:04:47
No, the police asked about time of death and she said she didn't hear anything but she had only been home for less than an hour. She dozed off on the couch for a few minutes but she's a light sleeper and doesn't think she could have slept through it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:03:42
Just wanted to thank you again. I just got off the phone with her and it was rough but what you said helped a lot. Thankfully I didn't have to break the news.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:13:06
Keep your bitcoin. Give it to charity. There may be a small blurb in the newspaper about this, but they aren't going to know why he did this. It's not like his wife is going to tell a reporter why he did it. I'm certainly not. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:26:30
What in the world could I possibly gain by making this up? Internet sympathy? I'll pass on that. I can't sleep and I live alone. So I came to reddit. Honestly don't know what else to do with myself right now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:31:50
To be honest I am pretty angry at him right now. It was completely selfish. I can't believe he would put us through this, especially her. She's broken. And his mother... it's just horrible.  I'll be there for them both until the day I die with ANYthing they need, and I'll be taking special care to make sure she doesn't relapse. I've been put in touch with a grief counselor who I'm hoping can teach me how to be the best friend to them I can be in this fucked up situation, and I also want to see a drug counselor on my own to discuss how to help her stay sober.       
Thank you for giving me important things to think about, it helps.

Which is exactly why we won't be talking to any media. That is no way to honor your best friend.
