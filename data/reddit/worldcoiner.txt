I think if you mull over what happened to the federal reserves of all those European countries when the Euro was introduced things might be easier to understand  (obviously this in and of itself did not end any fractional reserve banking, I understand that).  Yes, it's complex.  But humans are amazing at adapting to change.
The fractional reserve system has only been around for 101 years.  And in such a short time it is causing turmoil beyond belief.  No, not over night.  But our generation and the next are witness to the downfall.  You cannot continue to create 'wealth' out of nothing (based on debt obligations) indefinitely.  Such a system will collapse.  And it is.  And we are already adapting. :)

The bitcoin technology is exciting to me; I constantly post the latest news about bitcoin onto my fb page because I believe it is a revolutionary technology for the betterment of society and I like to share that with my friends.  If I were to post on to their own pages then yes, I could see how one would call it spam.
In terms of 'get rich quick scam'...well, it's obvious that you don't really know what bitcoin is all about and it bothers me that I'm even replying to this

Good news for general adoption going forward, bad news for the utopian ideal.  However, it is Bitcoin...once you have them, you can still be your own bank and operate on a decentralized level if you have the know-how to keep them safe.

I think that's probably enough backlash to send Mike et. al. reeling a bit.  It's obvious that they now realize they had made a mistake (in fairness, the 'selfies' option was probably a quick and rash decision in response to the fraud they were supposedly dealing with).  I think it's wise to give them a bit of time here now and sort this out.  And I agree, selfies for verification is not where we should be.  That being said, I think the future will involve more and more verification via social media logins, etc (where a lot of people already have 'selfies' posted on the net).  btw, what's stopping one from posting a selfie of some stranger?

In terms of fractional reserve banking in the future, I have to agree with you.  It is more likely than not that some form of fractional lending will occur, albeit in a decentralized, trustless manner
@_date: 2014-06-24 04:06:51
Of note, we still have 6-12 months before all of this is enforceable:
Ms. Duhaime noted, however, that legislation receiving royal assent doesn’t put it into effect; parliament sets the date when laws are in force. The next step, she wrote, is the regulatory process: drafting rules, a comment period for the rules, writing guidance for the regulations and a consultation period for the guidance; Ms. Duhaime predicted the regulatory process could take six months to a year.

The military coup has very little impact on day to day living, so I wouldn't be too concerned.  When I was there, the curfew from midnight to 4 am was a minor annoyance...and in the tourist areas it isn't really enforced, and in fact had already been lifted by the time I left.  Other than that, even in Bangkok I noticed nothing.  Their only concern is demonstrators amalgamating in the streets, so they want to quell that.

@_date: 2014-07-18 17:01:39
I agree.  Strict regulation in some important sectors ultimately serves to 'legitimize' Bitcoin for the laymen, the sheep, the masses.  It will allow Bitcoin to get into the hands of everyone, and this is what we all want.  The 1% of us that have been able to access and deal with Bitcoin ourselves over the past several years can continue to do so while skirting around such stifling legislation if we so desire.
It is unfortunate that this will ultimately trend Bitcoin toward some points of centralization, and likely toward a new fractional reserve system led by the top compliant players.
But concomitant mass adoption allows for the poor farmer in the Philippines to eventually have a Bitcoin wallet, and a reasonably tech savvy family member working abroad will still now be able to act as his/her own bank and instantly transfer Bitcoin from one smart phone to another for zero fees without using the services of a middleman.
Unlike the traditional regulated banking sector which we were basically forced to use for such cases, newly regulated Bitcoin brass such as Circle will now exist, but we don't HAVE to use them
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:57:47
Nice!  I have mine hooked up to an inverter which plugs into my car power adapter, and I use a wifi hotspot with my smart phone to connect via the cellular network.  I live off the grid so internet with cellular is my only way.

Using the Bitcoin technology to disrupt the traditional remittance infrastructure just makes sense, and it's all positive!  I've thought about this from day one...the average cost of sending money worldwide via traditional bank wires, Western Union, etc is 9.8%.  This is absurd!  As an example, for Filipino workers sending money back home this 9.8% equates to a large amount of equivalent pesos for working class farmers in rural areas.  Any time more money can be made available to family members back home it's good news!  Nice work guys

Just fyi, that Robocoin machine draws nowhere near the attention it did in the first month; don't let those numbers mislead you.  It was the very first ATM so obviously it drew everyone to it in that first month.  That's not to say that these numbers will never return; they could easily be eclipsed within a year or two or three.
The other ATM's in Vancouver (I've checked them all out) basically get one person using them per day at this point.  But it's still early for the ecosystem

My house will be up for sale and I will accept BTC.  2.5 hours north of Vancouver, BC (1 hour past Whistler ski resort).  Off the grid, in the woods by a lake in a gated community.  1/3 acre, 1200 square foot house over 3 stories, large 540 square foot deck.  
Power system includes two 175W solar panels, generator, battery bank, inverter, etc.  Satelite, flat screen TV, furnishings included.  Internet through cellular network (better speeds than wifi's in the city I've found).  Wood burning stove, propane stove, propane fridge and oven.  Propane costs about 300/year as long as I only use the wood stove (which is awesome heat!  the trees on my property is all i've used for 7 years).  
245,000 cnd equivalent.  Summers are hot here by the way, temps reaching 40 degrees celsius (over a 100 F).  I've lived here full time for the past 7 years growing my own veggies, etc.  Nearest amenities are in Pemberton, 20 mins. away (population 2100, many of whom work in the resort town of Whistler).  Anything you can possibly do outdoors is doable in Pemberton and Whistler.  You name it.  
Full timers here in our 160 lot community are awesome people, well educated, some raising kids.  We have our own water system (paid for)...glacial melt from the mountains in behind us....tastes soooo good!  Also our own fire hydrants, etc (but Pemberton services us as well).  Includes crappy boat on a trailer with three good motors (one electric).  In the fall there's good mushroom picking right outside your door :) (and ;))
Don't really want to sell but I want to move to the Philippines.  If it doesn't sell I'll rent it out.  PM me for more info if interested.

Only an early, informed adopter has the opportunity to profit from an appcoin.  The early adopters must hope that others buy in, that a certain %age of the others are unaware of the tendency to zero, and they must cash out early before the others catch on.

I have been a runner.  I know what it takes to work up to running half a marathon, 21 miles.  I have also seen that there are many full marathon runners that are somewhat overweight, some more than somewhat.  I have seen black belt karate instructors with medicine ball bellies.  And I also know what humans look like after running a marathon everyday for many many many weeks in a row.  Do you seriously want to continue splitting hairs here Bruce?  Have you seen the video of Jason's 'final leg arrival'?
I'm guessing you might be using me to draw out the rationality that has been previously (self?) veiled but you are catching some truthful glimpses?  There's a large psychological component associated with calling out something that was previously so apparently steadfast and true.  Let alone even beginning to delve into the actual possibility of thinking as such.  The happenings of 911 are a good comparison.  It's a herd mentality thing:  "If there is not even just one person that can side with my strong conviction then it is likely false and it would be best if I stuck with them and their line of thinking".  Feeding homeless people, after all, is supremely noble (albeit not so much in Florida's eyes, but that's neither here nor there).  Who would actually scam to this level?  Nobody.  One would think.

How will this affect BTC ATM operators?
Of 1-way machines?
Of 2-way machines?
Will this FINTRAC ruling for an exchange (from a post here) apply:
"...your entity (BTC exchange) is not, at this time, engaged in the business of foreign exchange dealing or remitting or transmitting funds by any means or through any person, entity or electronic funds transfer network as per the PCMLTFA and its associated Regulations. In fact, your entity doesn’t provide the services of remitting and/or transferring funds for the sake of the service; the transfer of funds is simply a corollary of your actual service of buying and selling virtual currency."

I live off the grid so I have a battery bank (8 batteries) that are charged via my solar panels (and generator).  The sun works quite well in the summers, but in the winters at 50 degrees north in the woods and in the mountains the generator has to be relied on quite often unfortunately.  Usually the panels are used to 'trickle' charge the last 8% capacity of the batteries, but right now in the summer I don't use the generator at all and it's all sun!
If you take care of the batteries they can last you 8-9 years.  One year if you don't.  Ideally, batteries like to be at 25 degrees Celsius and fully charged (so, once they reach 70% I charge them back to full immediately)

I hate to have to chime in here with some skepticism I felt after looking into Jason King's Run Across America.  Apparently he ran from Florida to San Francisco.  Soon after, there were some pictures of him at Bitcoin conferences, etc. and to me he did NOT look like someone who just ran across the United States.  I realize there are overweight marathon runners and that this is possible.  But if you run a marathon every day so as to make it from one US coast to the other, you are going to look quite thin.  Jason King, no chance.  Sorry.  Am I off base here?

Come on, the fractional reserve system is a ponzi scheme.  If they wanted to be transparent about it, it wouldn't work.  Of course they deliberately confuse the public; they have to.
And yes, people generally are lazy and disinterested, but this is a specific result of being misdirected.  I mean, these same people are not so lazy and disinterested so as to not go out and work most of their lives and have their money deposited into a checking account from which their mortgage payments are funded.  The wool has been pulled over their eyes, big time.

It's happening and will happen :)  It's rational, it's math.  With bitcoin 2+2 will always equal 4; fractional reserve, complex derivative-creating central banksters can't change that!
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:12:57
@_date: 2014-07-18 09:43:43
You know, I think these people simply have an understandable aversion to correct math.  The guys at the top have dealt with a fractional reserve system that has been manipulated via multiple complex derivative formulas to where 2+2 now equals 5 or 3.5.  It has worked for them at the top, but it is only 'sustainable' for a few generations.  They are not visionaries, nor care to be.  They are mere in-the-moment manipulators.  Survival of the fittest and all that.  Bottom line is, and it's very simple Ben, 2+2 equals 4.  And Bitcoin proves that.  Do your grandchildren a favor Ben, and don't steal from Bitcoin for their parents' fiat 'trust fund'.  It may very well be valueless.
@_date: 2014-11-08 03:44:27
Jim and Greg, you are both correct. Rational thinking such as 2+2=4 has allowed animals to go to the moon.  An absurd proposition still if one stares at it for a while.  True nonetheless.  Just as true as the buffet of irrational emotions Buzz and Neil no doubt experienced on their mission.
Sorry, too succinct I know.

30 years ago, any money deposited into a savings account generated 2-5% interest per annum (or whatever it was, it was a positive number whereby one's savings account increased in value).  This made sense, since the bank now had money that they could lend out to other parties at a higher interest rate.
Today, the bank still uses that money to lend out at a certain interest rate.  Even if the bank is only earning 1% interest from lending your money out, wouldn't it be fair to give you say, half of that, in interest earned on money deposited into your savings account?  Turns out this is no longer the case...average citizens are being duped by these banksters.
Never mind inflation and all that, if I deposit $3000 into a bank for safe keeping via a savings account (money which the bank will no doubt capitalize upon by lending it out to others), isn't it fair for me to expect that those $3000, at least, will still be there in 15 years?  After all, this is what a bank is for, to 'save' my money, no?
Yes, this would be fair.  But this is not how banks function anymore.  The fractional reserve banking system is slowly collapsing over the course of one or two generations.  For example, the US is printing 85 Billion dollars a month (yes, Billion, a month) simply to sustain the illusion of wealth that now exists.  
One can't continue creating wealth out of nothing.  All fractional reserve fiat banking systems will inevitably collapse because the structure is not sustainable.  In the meantime, for the system to barely stay afloat, banks (and govt's) need to start scraping away from the average joe.
What we are witness to in our generation is outright theft from centralized control centers (banks), all the while they continue to further manipulate their control via an infinite supply of paper money (ink printed on extremely thin slices of trees in the name of 'quantitative easing'). This is a further hidden theft that has always existed, termed inflation.  Fiat has no real value anymore.
The only resolution is to have some medium of exchange that is decentralized (whereby there is no single point of control and thus no single point of failure).  That functions via a peer to peer network (akin to downloading music via bitTorrent).  With a finite supply.  That is non-inflationary.  That holds value because of these qualities alone and is agreed upon by a large enough 'village' of individuals.  
Computer scientists have known about such a digital exchange system for many years.  Pure math based cryptography.  The unsolvable issue was the 'double spend' problem.  In 2008 this mathematical 'double spend' problem was solved.  Hence, the emergence of Bitcoin.

A bitcoin wallet (let's not call it a wallet) disguised as a smartphone game, ideally one that goes viral....a fremium based model with in-game virtual currency rewards, which could be purchased as well for power-up's, level-up's, etc.  The in-game coins...bitcoin.
If a simple game can be pushed to go viral (picture angry birds type of garbage), then this would mainstream bitcoin.
Obv the more of these games that are pumped out by bitcoin devs the better.  Let's move!

Well written article Eric. Ultimately I am an idealist such as yourself and everything you wrote I wholeheartedly agree with.  Unfortunately there are billions of sheep on this planet and a many millions of evil wolves; at some point the thought process tends from idealism to realism.  Here's a re-post of one of my previous responses to all this, any thoughts?
Strict regulation in some important sectors ultimately serves to 'legitimize' Bitcoin for the laymen, the sheep, the masses. It will allow Bitcoin to get into the hands of everyone, and this is what we all want. The 1% of us that have been able to access and deal with Bitcoin ourselves over the past several years can continue to do so while skirting around such stifling legislation if we so desire (unless, of course, some of us want more. And more.  And even more)
It is unfortunate that such legislation will ultimately trend Bitcoin toward some points of centralization, and likely toward a new kind of fractional reserve system led by the top compliant players, but this was predictable and obvious to me years ago.  Sad, but true.
However, concomitant mass adoption will allow the poor farmer in the Philippines to eventually have a Bitcoin wallet, and a reasonably tech savvy family member working abroad will still now be able to act as his/her own bank and instantly transfer Bitcoin from one smart phone to another for zero fees without using the services of a middleman.  This is what's really important.
Unlike the traditional regulated banking sector which we were basically forced to use for such cases, newly regulated Bitcoin brass such as Circle will now exist, but we don't HAVE to use them.

Collapse doesn't happen overnight and its effects won't necessarily be felt by relatively well-off individuals in the first world (although homeowners in Detroit definitely did in 2009).  Humans are great at adapting.  Especially with emerging technologies.  The best answer I can suggest is for your great grandchildren to compare their monetary system to the one that exists today.
My comments come from more of a macro (in regards to time) perspective on the state of mediums of exchange

BMO - Bank of Montreal successfully handles deposits into Canadian exchange Vault of Satoshi (they handle bitcoin, litecoin and peercoin).  As of two weeks ago they only allowed US dollar deposits.

Just hold and forget about it.  Bitcoin is still a baby and nobody should be surprised about its volatility.  It will be worth thousands upon thousands in the next 2 years.  These are blips...you'll have forgotten about it in 30 days.  But if you must panic sell to bring the price lower then that'll be good for us buyers.
