Nothing but the negative but in the backroom they are prepping to get deep into the wealth . .  
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:46:04
Next support is 0.5 FIB, then 8500 . .wow
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:02:50
7000 in the morning!
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:02:59
Yes. I agree but myself I'm not feeding anything into this until it goes to the 6K level and not a great amount as before. No expectations to see 12K or above anytime in the near future.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:14:10
Whatever the present BTC price is on GDAX or Binance  that would be considered the "spot" price, correct? If so, is their a correlation between spot price and the futures price? . . I guess I am wondering if there is a effort to bring down the spot price to be more in line with the futures market's ranges. BTC as a commodity being way overpriced to them and needs to be "reeled-in" before it is completely institutionalized? Whales, board of trade, Wall St. etc. after all are in control of this thing.

Going to 6k is what I see charted with very high confidence.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:46:18
Near zero buyer momentum . . GDAX
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:23:09
I get it. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:40:44
Yep, no sight of a reversal and I don't see any general euphoria here either. I'm waiting till I see validation from those I follow.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:10:06
Sounds like a good plan.
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:58:31
To the moon . . . 
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:16:13
Some can make money trading now but many can't especially lately. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:00:25
Yes. It also bounced off this on Feb 20. Although this time we made it farther above the downward trendline which could be interpreted as a positive sign. Still just not enough buyer commitment.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:26:14
yes, people love round numbers so they tend to make walls at 1000, 1050, 1100 etc
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:33:03
Damn will this puke already . . why are people buying now???
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:52:36
They stopped accepting credit cards awhile back.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:39:10
Good thinking, yes. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:44:57
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:16:51
GDAX buyers and sellers just making faces at each other . . 
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:25:28
I wasn't really sayin that . . don't read so much into it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:09:54
Mine fixed itself, thanks
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:53:01
Sorry, I asked if anyone had seen a reverse signal. Buying volume went up so all that says to me is some feel 7700 was the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:04:55
Thanks guys but I'm still confused. . . does the spot price drive the futures price?
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:13:02
There's no support . . 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:11:23
Refresh, it should go away.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:50:02
Those areas are where resistance is . . areas of consolidation where it  slows down and even reverses a little.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:34:48
Isn't there a halving or a release of BTC this year? What implications will that have on supply/price etc? Anyone?
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:11:14
No sell panic but clearly a lot of determination to keep this under 8400.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:51:21
I think there is plenty of time to buy. I expect it will reach the 8500 support level. If it goes thru that it will be into the 7000's before this done. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:14:21
Yesterday I was able to trade the tight swings a little with success . . that's gone today ;&lt; 
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:46:50
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:21:15
These crashes since January are keeping people away. Can't blame em. A lot of people have suffered. I would be surprised if it goes back to 11.5 again soon and will it bounce off that resistance yet another time. Strange "coincidence" the Mt. Gox story was revealed in the midst of this latest one.
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:04:06
Ha! . . the U.S couldn't deal with the metric system or 10-digit zip codes. Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:23:45
Everyone talks about new money coming in this year. Not gonna happen with markets this volatile. Mom and pop America can't deal with this unregulated shit. I love the profits but reality is tough.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:08:25
Yes. Volume died again. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:57:33
The Shorts and Longs are having a meeting right now about it . . 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:47:55
Help please! I have a mistaken order on GDAX it says "pending" and it won't cancel . . 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:01:46
Sent you a link
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:56:58
It's gone and fiat is back. . reload again and check
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:25:33
Has anyone seen a reversal candle pattern and that is why they are buying now?
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:37:02
Nothing has left the Mt. Gox cold wallet addresses recently so unless there was another avenue for the disposal of that coinage maybe this is just the fear of that happening again. Not entirely coincidental the release of that news came just after the latest rejection at 11.5K?
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:52:37
I want the damn thing to get to 6K and get this over with!
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:57:55
I cannot see BTC becoming a world currency in our lifetimes. The U.S. dollar is the currency of business and more importantly the price of oil is based upon it. The dollar is backed by the U.S. military. How do you see that changing?
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:37:24
At least stop buying until it bottoms out. Whaaa?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:58:39
Nope, he's offline now. His 4 hour chart is showing general pointer down to 6K in next 48 hours. I don't know if it's allowed to reference it here.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:42:38
You bring up some very good points. Myself, I could care less about HODL or the technology, just would like to make some cash. No expectations of 20K or ATH. I think that's not gonna happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:00:43
Tried to breach the 200 day avg.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:24:32
Glad to get any advice! But it is so volatile now, even worse than yesterday I think. I was buying 1/4 BTC below the low and then putting the sells in right away to make 10-20 bucks each time. I'm all the way out now and have been since March 5. Glad I got out near the top. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:55:40
??? Frickin me up . . ???
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:20:28
It WAS low volume a few days ago, low volume/no real buyer commitment, so no support. Transaction batching has nothing to do with volume, volume in this market is units moved. That was a bs story on Cryptocurrency dot something website.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:09:27
7000's Saturday  . . 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:53:04
I signed out and back in . . it's still there, It's dimmed but won't cancel and it has my cash.
