Thanks to ASICs his hardware is worthless in even the medium term.

Because Vertcoin blew-up in popularity so early in life there isn't a large contingent of early miners with vast sums. There are large miners but even those guys bulked their stash by buying early.
The exact numbers people point to are here: 
Personally I'm not too worried about fair distribution. What I like about vertcoin is the heavy bias in the community towards decentralization. There are 3 viable p2pools, plus p2proxies, and the largest percentage of hashing being performed by p2pool of any real coin.

I think botnets are a big issue but I think vertcoin has a decent solution by being GPU mineable.
I know there have been large botnets mining vtc but even the largest I've seen (100MH/s) is only 20x one of the typical larger GPU miners. The net effect is the botnet is too small to damage network security and thus helps security.

The font of the g in the address does not match the g in the text. As well the height of the address does not match the surrounding line.
I don't have Vuze installed to check but this is suspicious.

His GPU selection looks a lot like many scrypt rigs I saw during my alt-coin days. Both cards are the former champions of early 2014 alt-coin mining. Which would explain the AMD only aspect.

In that case I think we can all conclude that decreasing it is the only safe option.

Wait, are we supposed to campaign for the increase or against it? HR has not given me any direction or incentives either way. I assumed we were leaving it as is.

Wasn't the Evo scam a super-massive case of counter party risk?
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:45:38
No, it is very much impossible.

But Evo had mutlisig!

You mean take out loans? How would that help them?

The illuminaty pays us by how much we can depress the bitcoin price.
Once we've gotten the price low enough the plan is to switch the USA to bitcoin. The truth is that us Buttcoiners are all bitcoin true belivers. We all know that while the charts may look bad this is only a time of testing.
