Ya you're right man lol. I guess I'm just paranoid, I've been known to over-react lol. I appreciate your response and quite frankly am starting to agree with you.

Nothing bugs me more than coindesk saying "press time" like they are actually printing out news relevant to anyone but themselves. Haha

The same applies to all currency, crypto or otherwise.

That's a pretty good example of willful ignorance on his part lol thank you for making this clear to the uninitiated.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:48:27
Hey, thanks for that! That is good to know. I think I'm mosly just being paranoid, it just scares me because of of these people speak of how their account was frozen and then they dont get any response for a month+, which is just scary to me.
That being said, 300 reviews out of millions of user, I guess that answer my own question about paranoia? lol

Lol i mean, its all freely available information if you just use the magical organs in your face to absorb it. I'm genuinely curious how you think profitable traders make trade decisions. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:37:24
doubt what? I feel like you aren't even reading what I say because your responses are so off point from the message you are responding to.

lol never tried to fool you man. I'm saying that anyone that builds a trade system purely on TA is destined to fail because they don't understand the instruments they are using. Saying TA is useless is also not right because it's very useful, just not as a trading strategy alone.
The biggest edge in trading is using human psychology against humans. lol, you need to recognize times of high euphoria (bitcoin dec 2017) and times of high fear and use them to your advantage. In doing so you will be fighting every primal urge you have in your body to go against the herd, even when the media &amp; everyone you trust and love is telling you otherwise.
It's important to pay attention to the policy changes your government is making. Historically, there are certain catalysts for market crashes and one of the biggest tend to be interest rates and banking policy. For example,  historically, prolonged rises in interest rates tend to be followed by a market "correction". Times of lower interest rates tend to translate into stock market gains.
Only after I decide that the market is still healthy (which I don't think its healthy at the moment) would i begin to look for individual stocks. I'd look at their financials, I'd want to see a solid asset to debt ratio of at least 1.5:1 preferrably 2:1, i'd want to see rising cashflow, revenue, and equity YOY. I'd want to see active developement of new products or have such a good product that there's no reason for their sales to deteriorate... Only then would I start looking at TA.
TA to me is literally: where are solid support and resistance lines for 1-2 years ago that i can use as a mental stop loss, What is the balance of buyers versus sellers, is there decent momentum showing or is it starting to die out, what is the market sentiment for this company.
TA is not meant to be a trading strategy alone. It's very helpful though at times.

HFT is still a thing, it used to be one of the most profitable strategies among wallstreet.
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:08:45
It depends on the trader. High frequency traders trade often and are highly profitable. I think the disconnect here is that people think TA is something to base a trading strategy off of, when in reality it is more used to help confirm trading decisions you already want to make due to underlying fundamentals. It is possible to time the market, many large investment banks do... they just arent using only TA to make these decisions.
Anyone that says TA is snake oil just doesnt have a proper understanding on what TA is actually showing you. Its just a mathematical/statistical way of presenting the same data you already have access to.
