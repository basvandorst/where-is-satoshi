An interesting idea - I think it'd be interesting to have folks distributing satoshi's at these kinds of things for sure.  Any event is good, but I think things that are "worldly" and highly visible would be ideal.  Sadly, these Olympics don't seem too friendly to bitcoin, for some reason.... hmmm... i wonder why....

If only smartcontracts were here already - we could realistically kickstart some kind of purchase, granted not anything to that level

Thanks Captain!
I'll take your edits into account.  Love your point regarding the language use, it resonates!  
Again - big thanks for taking the time and for my very first reddit bot tip - Looks like I gotta figure this out!
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:02:59
Does anything like this exist so far?

Thanks for the feedback Astrolen - most definitely appreciate it! and you are correct, those are the words I would have preferred.  
I think your perspective of volatility as a measure of adoption / acceptance is very interesting and will ponder further.
Thank you again for taking the time to provide constructive feedback!

Through the Bitcoin Looking Glass: 
Why ‘Getting’ Bitcoin is a Privilege and What the Mainstream is Missing Out On
By Ryan Walker
February 28th 2014
Bitcoin has yet to truly break into the popular consciousness. This is unfortunate because it means that the majority of society is missing out on the opportunity to witness, engage with, and participate in the infancy of what may well be the most powerful and globally unifying phenomenon the world has ever seen.  
For context, we must first attempt to define what Bitcoin actually is. This proves a difficult thing to achieve succinctly as Bitcoin is in fact a great many number of things.  To most, Bitcoin is understood to be a fledgling digital currency.  It has a recognizable value and can be used as a means of exchange. In this way the definition is absolutely correct, but the danger in being satisfied with this definition is that it misses the greater scope of what Bitcoin truly is.  Fundamentally, Bitcoin is a network that allows for consensus across a distributed ledger.  Stated more simply, Bitcoin is an invention that enables peer-to-peer transactions and, through the application of cryptography, eliminates the need for individuals to put their trust in any given third party.  The implications of this breakthrough are far reaching and will release a torrent of innovation throughout the world of finance and beyond in the years to come.
The most incredible part of these developments is that the scale of the Bitcoin community remains small enough that anyone that can access it can interact with it. Well, for now at least… Have you ever wished you were on the other end of the line receiving Alexander Graham Bell’s first phone call in 1876? Maybe you would have preferred to have been standing on Kill Devil Hill in 1903 when Orville Wright took his famous first flight? Better yet, maybe you’d have preferred to have been a fly buzzing through the halls of the Harvard dormitories when Mark Zuckerberg first launched Facebook 2004? For those in close proximity at some point there was recognition that they were on the precipice of something far greater; that the world had suddenly changed forever and no one else knew it yet.  The buzz of excitement resulting from such events is most often rare and restricted to the lucky few that are present at that time.  Thanks to the interconnected world in which we now live this pervasive and intoxicating energy is constant throughout the Bitcoin community.
Further, this fortunate minority is experiencing much more beyond the initial “buzz”.  For these participants, an enthralling storyline is playing out. This is a tale of high stakes drama, criminal conspiracy, ideological debate, a massive innovation race, and class struggle on a global scale. Through the miraculous portal that is the internet thousands of Bitcoiners are following every second of the saga and loving it.  It includes a host of characters the likes of which the best minds in fiction would be hard pressed to conjure up.  The cast includes a mysterious and absent ‘Wizard of Oz’ like creator known only by the surname Satoshi Nakamoto. A host of evangelists appear active at all hours of the day, leaving many to wonder if they actually sleep. Among them are a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt known as “Bitcoin Jesus”; famous for making a $1 million dollar bet on the currency, a prophetic security guru leading a host of cultish disciples, and an economic free-thinker stealthily operating out of Panama.  Villains abound as well, including a demonized cat lover with a “Magical Tuxedo”, a host of politicians and every centralized power-wielding government the world-wide.  Heck, there’s even a Mad Hatter-like moderator circa Alice in Wonderland filling the community in on the “Daily bits” of breaking news.  Who needs cable or Netflix when bitcoin is around?  Did I forget to mention there is an unthinkable amount of money at stake? In just its fifth year, Bitcoin at one point achieved a market cap high of more than $12 billion.  It experiences price swings at levels of volatility opponents argue will prove to be its demise.  Despite this, enthusiasts estimate future valuations on an exponential scale making the most recent market cap seemingly insignificant. 
By engaging this community participants are not only entertained but forced to learn.  Topics do not only include computer science and cryptography, in fact those topics are most often only discussed exclusively by the true experts in the field and are not a requirement for understanding.   At its core, learning about Bitcoin means learning about a wealth of disciplines including philosophy, economics, history, finance, politics and culture.  Bitcoin journeymen and journeywomen are introduced to concepts such as ‘decentralization’ and can begin to recognize how it’s impacting them more and more each day.  They are forced to challenge the traditional understanding of trust, and more importantly, are provided a glimpse into a future where trust in fallible third-parties, be it central banks or governments, is no longer required.
For many “getting” Bitcoin is a Pandora’s Box that most find themselves hard pressed to ignore.  Once you get it – you can’t un-get it.  For those already navigating the crypto-currency community, this is all a way of life.  Twitter is their newspaper.  Reddit, for better or worse, is their Coliseum.  For Bitcoiners, the mainstream media’s coverage, rout with misleading headlines, ignorance, and overwhelming hubris, is a laughable distraction to be managed (if possible). For Bitcoiners, time is not day and night, it runs on a non-stop 24/7 clock. With that, if you have the time, consider checking out some of the resources I’ve posted below – or better yet, start searching and thinking for yourself.  By doing so, you may find yourself many years from now recalling how “you were there” when Bitcoin forever changed the world. But before you do, make sure you have some free time because you’ll wish you had more - this shit is going to blow your mind.

Awesome! Thanks - would be interested to see how to go about.  Promote local vendors?  Document at the event? etc.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:15:29
Give it a try!  This article for example was a huge ramble at first.  It took a couple iterations and times "stepping away" and coming back to it before I was able to finally get it to my liking.
It seems you have good thoughts and inisights, don't waste them!
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:24:55
Righteous!
