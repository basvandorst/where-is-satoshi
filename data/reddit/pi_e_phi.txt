How exactly do I get into this shilling business, please advise. Will shill for BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH, PPC, hell I'll even shill for MZC, love my MZC.

Was there not a sharp, short uptick in early 2018?

IDK, trading algorithms react to short rapid changes. I'm not making a claim here though. Just wondering. Up up up then sell sell sell then market bumped up. I make no claim of expertise to be clear.

I always figured that when the block reward shrinks we will have less miners. In that case the hash rate drops and thus the difficulty. With a lower difficulty, the remaining miners will need less hash power and this use less energy and this lowers the mining cost keeping it profitable with less coins.

It depends on the difficulty level at the time. Make sure you read info that is up to date. An article from 2 years ago comes from a time when mining was easier. Today to mine 1 BTC a day you would need about 100 TH. This would be like buying 25 antminer s7s at 1200 dollars a pop, this is a $30,000 investment. Which might take 100 days to pay off, assuming the difficulty does not increase. Also, the block reward will halve soon meaning the same power would only get you .5 btc a day.  However if electricity does not matter, buying a $400 1Th miner could be fun. You won't make tons of money but eventually it should pay off. Here is an online calculator you can use to see how much you will get with a given hash rate, it does assume no halving and difficulty increase though.

That's a good point. I suppose it is important to keep incentives for miners if only to avoid that scenario.

Actually it is both electricity and investment cost. Asic miners require massive amounts of energy and as such you need enough of them to make a profit. To buy enough you need alot of money. If electricity does not matter though, then any home miner would make you money. Depending on how powerful it is though it may be a long time before you make back what you spent.

Bitmain sells pretty great miners, they are easy to set up and they sell them in low volume, other companies might make you buy in bulk. The antminer line is what I use. I operate at a loss for sure but it is a fun hobby.
