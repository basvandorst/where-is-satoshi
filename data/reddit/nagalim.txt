I've personally debunked the nothing-at-stake problem so many times in the past two years it's getting tiresome to keep repeating the same arguments.  
  
Reply  pretty succinctly describes it, but basically there is not only no incentive to fork a PoS blockchain, there is non-zero negative incentive.  Unless you can do something like ETC did (i.e. have a legitimate consensus reason to fork), in which case PoW isn't going to save you either.

The 'debunking' is many conversations held by many people coming to consensus and creating code.  That pdf that's waved around is a rambling document that never really comes to a point about anything.  Rewriting history would cost an attacker as much time and effort as they spend rewriting it, because no one would accept their history as valid.  It's true, the cost is less than PoW, but the whole point of PoS is that PoW is wasteful.  The added 'cost' is unnecessary and superfluous.  There has never been a 'rewrite history' attack on a PoS coin and there is very little reason to think that there ever will be.  Yes, one can duplicate a chain, but getting people to download your chain thinking that it's real - or more importantly getting a high stakes client like an exchange to download your chain and think that it's real - takes some serious social engineering.  It's akin to getting someone to download a sabotaged bitcoin client.  Which, again, is to some degree what happened with eth and etc, and shows that PoW is by no means immune to this type of social engineering.  There is subjectivity in PoW, there is subjectivity in all wealth distribution.  Energy costs a different amount in one country as in another, different PoW algorithms calculate amount of work done differently, clients consider some work valid and other work not so much.  It's about finding an arrow of time, PoW tries to tie it to entropy, PoS ties it to collective human consciousness.  There are lots of discussions to be had about all of this and our role as humans coming to consensus in the universe at large, but people are looking for quick answers and pdf's written by single individuals that they can tout as the 'right answer'.

So I can 'checkpoint' the btc blockchain by simply downloading the chain and announcing I have a legitimate version for anyone to download if they trust me.  The fact is, ppc has never rolled back to a checkpoint.  Sure, the threat is there, but the threat is also there for btc that miners will decide to rollback to a particular block height.  So no, check pointing is not why ppc has never been attacked.  Ppc has never been attacked because it's not economically feasible to stake grind with the minimum txn fee in place.
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:13:08
Nah, I'm not saying that's what happened.  I'm saying that's the incentive to mine empty blocks.  PoW incentivizes miners to mine empty blocks as long as txn fees are &lt;&lt; block rewards.  As long as the incentive is there, it's not so much about whether it occurs or not and more about high profile miners mining empty blocks to get that slight advantage.  I'm saying this is in addition to the benefits of spv mining.
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:10:58
The objections are purely theoretical and bad theory at that.  The only real argument against PoS comes down to whether you can trust humans to come to consensus about something over the long term (weak subjectivity).  The fact that some governments (a long-term human consensus process) have existed for hundreds of years kinda flies in the face of the 8 years btc has existed for.  Note that weak subjectivity is also used in bitcoin (btc core) and is revealing a shitshow of politics on the long term scale (theymos).  Basically, the only flaws ppc has are the same flaws that bitcoin and in fact all governments and human consensus processes face.
@_date: 2015-12-04 04:40:30
You make a good point: even if fees are much less than reward, as long as the risk of losing due to filling the block is comparably small it evens out.
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:30:06
Also, an empty block propagates faster through the network than a full block.  So if an empty block and a full block are mined at the same time, the full block will most likely get orphaned.

The dividends are paid in ppc.  That means the bot successfully traded 20000 for ppc.  That alone speaks to the value of the currency.  In the event of an expected or ongoing run on the bank, interest rates would spike up, as they would in the US economy.  We see nothing of the kind even as btc dumps.  It's like you're saying nu is unsuccessful because it sold the product it produces.
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:22:29
Nbt can be used to park, so there is incentive to hold.  It can also be used as virtual currency, so it is convenient to hold just so it can be used more readily.  Interest rate is a health statistic and as it is low, it says the health of nu is very good right now.  All crypto is inflationary, that's what mining is, and nbt allows for a deflation via nbt burning, one of the few coins to really do so in a decentralized fashion.  There's more, you're worried about tier 1 liquidity when there are 5 more tiers.
   Let's pretend everyone with nbt decided to sell on CCEDK for USD all at once.  First the peg would be eaten and sell walls below $1 would show up.  Assuming market sentiment didn't immediately buy up the walls for a quick profit, within seconds Nu would dump all the money on the exchange to buy up the nbt.  Assuming that didn't do it, and the market's reaction to those big green candles didn't do it, we would move to tier 3.  Funds would take time to procure, so the market again has a chance to stabilize before nu buys a bunch more.  In this time, motions would be passed and new custodians found with more liquidity.  Interest rates would go up to promote taking funds off exchange.  In that way, a short term problem is turned into a long term problem and the peg is saved.  Long term, motions can be passed to recover and the interest rate will indicate the effectiveness of the recovery.  This is how most national economies deal with a depression, and it has worked thus far.  Yes, nushares holders would get the shaft as nsr would be sold for liquidity, but the nubits users are protected.  The point is, there is no insolvency that sneaks up on you with Nu; you can tell the health of the network from the interest rate and divest when it goes up a lot.  It is currently incredibly low (I think it might be 0% currently)

B&amp;C exchange is going to be an important benchmark for decentralized exchanges. The beginning of this year made it pretty clear that centralized exchanges are stuck in the same paradigm that fiat is: one where you have to decide which dubious character to trust.

Converting black to white basically means registering the address and promising not to send them to an unregistered address (I.e. making them black again).  So going black to white means promising not to go white to black under penalty of law.  Therefore, black supply will shrink while white supply grows.

Meanwhile, another successful distribution occurs, showing they have plenty of liquidity.  Good luck waiting for a run on the bank, especially as they get nbt burning going.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:55:32
If 60% of the network gets on board with a change that fools the other 40% of the network into thinking they're verifying when they're not, then 40% of the users/miners/blocks aren't checking what the other 60% are doing.  This is dangerous.  Whether it's more or less dangerous than people getting isolated on their own chain is really not very important.  They're both dangerous, they're both legitimate ways of upgrading the software, to stigmatize one or the other is counterproductive.

This is a good article, i think.  I need to take my time on it, but it looks like the basic argument is that BitUSD is not as useful as USD because it is not as trustworthy.  
"BitUSD is not useful for spending, where it is permanently inferior to both (Bitcoin + Bitpay) and the real USD."  
But if you're able to convert BitUSD for BTS in the internal exchange system at a rate that is better than open exchanges, then your BitUSD is actually worth more than USD.  
  
I'm not an expert on BTS, but I know a ton about Nu.  If you can get a motion passed to burn your NBT for NSR at a rate that is higher than the going market rate, then your NBT is worth more than USD.  As we make 'getting a motion passed' more convenient and fluid, this case will be true ~50% of the time.  So half the time NBT is worth slightly less than $1 and half the time it's worth slightly more than $1.  If NBT can be valued at higher than $1, then it is not 'permanently inferior'.  
  
Anyway, I'll give it a more thorough read through later tonight.

But isn't bitreserve also a middle man between your btc and fiat?  I have never used either shapeshift or bitreserve, so feel free to call me ignorant, but doesn't bitreserve also have exchange rates?  
I may be being obtuse; let's use an example.  I have $100 USD in btc, I send it to bitreserve.  A month later I withdraw $100 in btc.  Alternatively, I send my btc to shapeshift and get 99.99 nbt which I put in a wallet on my computer.  A month later, I shape shift the nbt back for $99.98 worth of btc.  In the second case I pay $0.02 for the priveledge of not holding my money ina centralized service for a month.
  
Is this accurate or am I being dense?

@_date: 2015-07-17 20:59:02
Ok, cool, so your issue is not with a fee it is with the trader taking a spread, which ultimately looks like a fee to the user.  I was not aware bitreserve literally has no spread, that's a pretty cool feature.  One question though:  how do they make money if they're on a 100% reserve model?  If they spend even $1 wouldn't they become insolvent?  Are they investing the money and hoping for a positive return?  In that case, wouldn't a negative return on an investment basically push them into insolvency?  
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:01:37
Yah, i checked out their reserve list.  At least you know when to get out, but if you aren't watching the list and they go insolvent people will divest quickly and leave some with bupkis.  So yes, bigger fee via shapeshift, but much more security.

The fee for NBT is literally 1 cent.  Whether you're trusting a centralized service or a decentralized peg, there's trust involved either way.  Bitreserve could freeze your account, like you say, or their reserves could be compromised in one way or the other.  NBT uses a zero-reserve model for this very reason: money in a reserve is counterparty risk.

So where does 'Escrow my Bits' fit in there?  Are you just saying we should use bitreserve over 'Escrow my Bits'?  I'm saying if 'Escrow my Bits' charges a service fee, it will do so whether it uses NBT or Bitreserve as the pegging mechanism.
Based on your edit:  Right, so you're saying we shouldn't even use 'Escrow my Bits' whereas killjoy1x is saying 'Escrow my Bits' should use bitreserve.
As far as I can tell, the only fee Shapeshift charges is the 'miner fee', which is the 0.01 NBT I mentioned.  So, if you want to call it a double fee, the fee is 2 cents.  So you're paying 2 cents for the guarantee your funds won't get frozen.  Sounds like a good deal to me.

If the service requires a fee, it would require the fee whether it uses NBT or Bitreserve.  If the statement is that you should use bitreserve over starsoccer9's 'Escrow my Bits' ok, but I understood killhjoy1x's statement that 'Escrow my Bits' should use bitreserve over NBT because of the fee associated with NBT.  That particular fee is 0.01 NBT, which is trivial to basically all humans everywhere that aren't doing microTx.

But we decide on the consensus rules using weak subjectivity.  And we change them the same way.  You can say 'bitcoin died and a new bitcoin was born' but if every user consents that it's still bitcoin then we have formed consensus and it's the same bitcoin.  What bitcoin 'is' is entirely weakly subjective.  Saying a hard fork kills bitcoin and a new one is born is like saying that every time we change our minds we die and a new 'us' is born.  It makes no sense to think that way, it is vastly superior to just accept that all systems have weak subjectivity and to embrace it and find ways to work with it.  That's what PoS is, the logical continuation of the concept of weak subjectivity.

Yah, that article is a year old and has been refuted a hundred times.  I'll go ahead and give you a tl;dr:
1.  The supply is not constantly increasing, that's a straight up falsehood.  We can provably burn NBT and can use NSR as economic leverage to do so.  A quick look at CMC will tell you that NBT marketcap has been decreasing while price remains stable; i.e. the supply is decreasing.
2.  Parking rates have been close to 0% for a long time now.  The 'bad incentives' argument is a strawman that always involves using rates like 100% across day long park times.  Interest rates are healthy and used in most modern economies.  We have only paid out $3300 for parking so far, which really pales in comparison to the size of our project.
3.  It is completely false that we have no destruction.

Cryptocoin supply is not its beauty in my opinion: transparency, decentralization, and security are.  NBT accomplishes all these while also satisfying the requirement of currency that it be stable.
  
If you think BTC is stabilizing, I'd like to point to the 50% price swing we've had over the last month.  
  
You can use NBT for everything you use BTC for, except for hording as gold 2.0.  It is not gold 2.0, it is USD 2.0.  So sure, use it to hedge, or to transfer wealth, pay for stuff, save a stable supply of money, implement crypto Tx in the internet of things, etc.  All this isn't even to mention NBT's 10x faster block times.

Both of those papers end up just describing weak subjectivity and why they think it's bad.  However, bitcoin also runs off weak subjectivity, that's what this entire blocksize debate is about.  If i can invalidate your work done by changing the algorithm, what does it matter if you consumed electricity or not?  Weak subjectivity, even in bitcoin.  
  
As for the grind, i am not talking about a 51% attack.  Im saying that in order to generate a peercoin output you need to destroy peercoin (the fee).  To grind you need to destroy a lot of peercoin.  You can calculate the number required to get 6 confirmations in a row, it turns out to be a big number.

@_date: 2015-11-04 21:16:34
Yet the average user talks all the time about data plans without having any clue about the back end.  It's pretty standard for a user base to criticise a product without understanding it.  The question is how the community in the know responds, and if they respond negatively it tends to ostracise the user base and then you get a faction of users collectively generating a narrative.  They most often don't understand the intricacies, but there is a reason this happens and a way to prevent it.  You are not doing your party a service, you are undermining it.

For ppc strong is measured based on how distributed the minting is.  There are a number of ways of getting a kind of number for this, but pos difficulty along with distribution of say the top 100 wealthiest ppc addresses (which is a stat where ppc beats many others coins including btc) is a good indication.  
So you wait 30 days to start forking, and you mint a block.  Now go ahead and wait another 30 days before you can mint the next one.  Unless you're getting everybody (&gt;51% stake holders) to do this with you, you aren't gonna beat the current chain.  If the network is still young you might be able to get the stake holders to join you, as nothing is at stake right?  Well, we check pointed 30 days ago, so you can only change the history of the last 30 days.  So by the time your mint is ready to find a block, the transaction that put your mint where it is on the blockchain is already frozen in the checkpoint.  
Anyway, the network is already distributed enough where this is only purely hypothetical anyway.  The 30 day wait basically stops all attacks of this nature.
@_date: 2015-03-10 21:23:01
Coindays is stake*(time since last time the stake was used/moved - 30 days).  If you split your stake into multiple addresses, your stake in each is less, so you are splitting your number of coindays too.  Staking from one address is essentially the same as staking from many given the same total stake.  You would need to have more stake than the rest of the network to make a longer chain, the same as how you have to have more computing power than the rest of the network to fork POW.  
  
When you talk about finding keys to old stakes, you're saying addresses where there once were peercoins but there are no longer?  So you are finding keys to addresses where at one moment in time those addresses collectively held the majority of the network?  Then you build your chain from there, and no one will know the difference between your chain and the real one.  Did I get that right?   
   
If you're getting old keys, the people giving them to you must be sufficiently convinced that they are so old that there is no chance you'll be able to make a chain.  This is where weak subjectivity comes in to play.  Basically, it's hypothetically possible if no one had any social interaction that you could confuse people into thinking your chain is correct.  However, we as humans are good at consensus over the long term (and this is a long range attack by virtue of using "old" keys).  Meaning: I know yours isn't right, because I got the right chain from a trusted source a while ago and I don't trust you.  It's only in the short term and the fledgling era that we have a hard time knowing who to trust.  Once the system is established and we have time to think about it, we don't need checkpoints, we just get our block chains from trusted sources.  Subjective, human trust in the long term; objective, computerized consensus in the short term.  That is POS.

POS is minting, not mining.  I think your also referring to the "nothing-at-stake" problem, whereby you can use your stake on multiple forks whereas computing power requires devotion.  However, this is solved by giving a 30 day wait period before your stake starts minting.  This effectively prevents anything happening in the short term.  For the long term, once the network is strong it cures itself and while the network is weak in its fledgling status we have check pointing.  We are already nearing the end of the check pointing phase with PPC.

I spend quite a bit of time supporting the dollar.  Like most of my life.  The amount of time I've spent supporting btc is trivial comparatively.  And yes, I'm pissed that the currency I get paid in, pay my taxes in, and make most transactions in is kept high to profit criminals.

Btc-b is like an IOU.  They got a 1000btc zero interest loan and paid 500 of it toward the IOU's.  This amounts to ~7% of what they owe (500/7000=~7%) and was given in proportion to the btc-b people held.  My account now says how much btc-b I had as well as how much they gave me back.  The btc I have that I can trade or withdraw is on a separate line just above the btc-b line in my balances.

Also, I personally received ~7% of the btc they owe me.  I've since traded it for NSR on bter, as trading is also open now.

The answer to this is [weak-subjectivity]( aka check pointing.  The short range attack is fixed objectively using stake while the long range attack is fixed subjectively (I.e. if you are new to the network, get the most recent checkpoint 'from a friend').  While it may not seem rigorous, humans are actually quite good at consensus in a general sense.  It is only in the short range that we need computers to automate the consensus.  
For instance, don't we also depend on long term social consensus to determine the protocol rules for POW?

Difficulty is empirical, meaning it auto adjusts every 2 weeks to match the hash power of the miners.  The issue is that the devoted mining hardware has gotten a lot more powerful recently, so a steep drop in price makes a 51% attack more likely as the power is there with no incentive to protect the network against it.  Every miner who turns his rig off to save on electricity during this low price/ high difficulty period makes the network that much less secure.  A declining difficulty is a telltale sign of danger, while an increasing difficulty is indicative of a strong, secure network.

Every crypto uses a concept of difficulty.  I don't think you even know what you're complaining about anymore.
Just solve more hashes and your btc fork will be the longest.

We need pos for the short term, as humans suck at consensus on the second and millisecond scale.  
The minimum fee of .01 ppc prevents block chain bloating.  You'll find that the ppc block chain is actually extremely small given its age, such that even a mobile phone can be a node.  
I agree that one could hypothetically create a block chain with more destroyed coindays using a relatively small cost.  However, because of how you create this block chain, it would have to be substantially different from the current block chain so that you maintain majority stake.  You could not, for example, make a block chain just like the current one with only one minor change in a transaction.  You could make a chain where everyone gave you their coins 6 months ago, but who would accept your new block chain over the block chain they've had for the last 6 months that they got from a reputable source?  Only people you bribe would, and at that point you're just relaunching ppc with a premine and no one will trust your chain.

You don't have a userbase, but btc does.  I can't wait for the time when so many people use btc that most have no clue how it all works.  You think the average citizen has any clue how cellphones work?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:09:41
I think you need to read the peercoin white paper.  Total consumed coindays are how longest chain is chosen, this is well understood.  The whole point is that if you have multiple stakes you can vote more than once, but it requires more stake in the system.  Your entire argument is based on the assumption that there is a large stake somewhere not minting and an attacker gains control of it and uses it to fork.  A large stake at one address not minting is the exact opposite of a strong network (many addresses with large pos difficulty) and as I've said this is not and will never again be the case.  If someone is "lying" about the age of their coins, they would need the transaction to appear on an earlier block than when they received the coins, which would mean they'd have to fork in order to lie, but you're saying they lied in order to fork, so it's a recursive argument.  If the network is not well distributed (as has been the case), checkpoints are centralized by the devs with no possibility of splitting the network.  Now that the network is well distributed, checkpoints are not needed.  There really isn't a flaw here to exploit, which is easily shown historically in addition to the solid theoretical framework: ppc is not a new coin and it has not been forked.  As time goes on it only gets stronger and this only becomes more true.  Meanwhile POW collapses on itself as it tries to keep paying off its miners to keep the network secure via third party.

Again, you only need a trusted source literally the first time you turn your node on.  Once again, we are past the point where this kind of attack is possible, as a large number of nodes are on already.  There is nothing manual about it, it's all automated at this point and works fine.

So you're saying a new exchange comes online and you feed them the wrong block chain so they are selling faux-ppc rather than real ones.  If the exchange isn't in on the attack, that seems like a really dumb exchange to be downloading the block chain from somewhere other than the usual trusted sources.  If the exchange is in on it, well they could do that with btc: sell something called "btc" that doesn't appear on the block chain that everyone passes around.  Either way, sounds like this hypothetical exchange using the wrong block chain is destined to fail hard and fast, and any hope for adoption of your somewhat painfully constructed alternative block chain with it.  
The key point here being that an exchange that uses the current block chain will not switch to a different contradictory chain just because it's longer.  That is the whole point of the 30 day thing: if this different chain is longer with the same history up to 30 days, we'll accept it.  If it's different beyond the 30 days, it's been modified and tampered with clear as day.  Good luck getting "old" keys for the majority of the network where "old" means less than 30 days.

So no sources or citations and bter already reimbursed 500 of the 7000 btc.  I'm gonna go ahead and say you're full of FUD.

I'm pretty convinced a dynamic fee like you are talking about is the best long term solution.  There are also more subtle benefits than preventing ddos, basically reducing block chain bloat.

POS difficulty readjustments stop rapid block inflation, same concept as POW difficulty.  A single low stake block would not be a point of attack, as it is total consumed coindays that matters, same as total computing power for POW.  No matter what you would need the majority of the network to be in cahoots with you to attack the network.  Meaning, to attack the network you have to be the network.
