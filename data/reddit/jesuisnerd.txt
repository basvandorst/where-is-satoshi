Any public address you would give to somebody for you to receive coins at.  Once you mine enough to get over a small threshold (I think it's .001 BTC, ~$10 worth) they send it right to you.

Lucky bastard, I only got out and bought back in at 11/9.5k

Well I have 977 Doge and that's worth about 66¢ I think.  So we'll need a couple more people to pitch in.

I'm pretty sure gets the whole joke and tried to continue it, only got the first half and assumed was replying seriously.

You can mine straight to any Bitcoin address you want, though if you're mining with any small home setup (like me, just have a spare GTX 1080 doing it) they have slightly lower fees if you mine to the wallet they provide and withdraw it later.

I figured it was going to drop further, so I put in $500 at ~10.7k and another $500 at ~9.5k (I was a bit late to notice the dip :(   )

NiceHash is an easy way to get setup mining, especially if your end goal is BTC.  You use your GPU or dedicated hardware to mine whatever altcoin it deems most profitable, and cashes you out in bitcoin.

Any chance you registered an email with the account?  It can't hurt to just search for "bitcoin" and "BTC" through your inbox and archives.

Joke's on you, I SODLed at 11k and bought back in at 9.5.  Now I have even more to HODL!

Why all these replies trying so hard to dissuade people from participating at all?  I first started playing with Bitcoin in 2010/2011 with little more than $100 into it, because I was intrigued by the technology and wanted to have fun with it.
I got way more enjoyment and knowledge out of that $100 than I could have many other ways a young kid would spend some spare cash.

Most of the exchanges still have functioning orders happening behind the scenes even when the interfaces are down/overloaded.  I always have some low buy orders sitting around in case of a flash correction (as expected after such steep increases) and got a confirmation email from Gemini while the site itself was pooped.
Edit: obviously this still prevents you from putting in new orders until the commotion settles, so I get around this by always having orders in that anticipate some commotion that I can profit from.

I don't get this mentality.  Unless you plan on holding into the *potential* future where you can use Bitcoin as an everyday currency, never selling gives significantly less opportunity for actual material benefits.
Buy the dips, sell on the way up.  I split the profits to siphon out some into USD, and re-invest the rest to increase BTC holding.

Ah, really cool to see coin_artist's newer puzzle being finally solved :)
These puzzle photos have spawned years of community effort to find all the clues - here's the *massive* bitcointalk thread of it:

Visit garage and estate sales.  I've gotten two so far, one for $5 and one for $15.  Both in excellent condition, one even with its original case and manuals/inserts in plastic bag.

Any remotely popular bitcoin app can handle QR code payments, and some have even adopted NFC functionality to make tap-n-pay style bitcoin transactions possible.

But earlier in the same sentence, 


Which implies that the follow-up is not already in existence and cannot, therefore, be righted.  I think it's more likely that he's simply an idiot.
