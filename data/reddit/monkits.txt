Well that's definitely the case *now*.

Sounds a great intro to a walk into a bar joke 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:15:58
Yeah they should probably update that. It's very misleading to people just getting into to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:42:38
What are you going on about in the title? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:27:43
'best country in the world to be homeless in' sure is one whack claim. There are countries that have virtually eliminated homelessness, surely a homeless person would be better off in one of those unless they actually want to be homeless.

Never trust a "crypto chick" on twitter. I think a lot of the shill accounts are going with female personas now. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:49:59
Sorry guy. I just wanted to explain it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:26:03
Ah capital gains, yet another reason to HODL. Don't need to pay CGT if you never gained anything... 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:23:36
B and D are apps that don't fill either part of the question. Paypal while used for online transactions, itself isn't a currency where as bitcoin is. So it should be bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:40:14
You can get a visa card backed by your bitcoin, then buy whatever you need with that. At the moment bitcoin transactions are slow and costly, so I wouldn't recommend using it as direct currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:16:08
LN development has always been running behind schedule. So don't expect it to come out fast and fix everything any time soon.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:08:05
Sure you want to buy bitcoin? There are other coins too. How about a nice shiny Ethereum? 
Seriously though. You're better off trying other coins if you're just getting your feet wet. The fees with btc will ruin it for you. Maybe get some litecoin, it works almost exactly the same as btc so you'll be learning what you need to know to use btc tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:42:43
Wonder what a next block transaction fee will look like at 80k? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:18
That was my prediction also. Didn't expect to feel this bad about being right.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:15:40
Buying in at 19~20k is very tough right now. I wish you all the best of luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:51:51
If the only trades you've made were buying bitcoin and you never sold, spent or swapped it, then you have no CGT to pay. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:40:57
Oh nice. Always feels good to see that confirmation pop up. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:08:20
Does the pound sterling inflate when the fed prints more US dollars? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:04:53
Yeah but we need positive LN news every day to keep up the hype. If there's no new news then old news will do! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:42:40
No one is going to eat heavy losses just for the sake of bitcoin history. If the fees are too high they're going to use something with lower fees, if bitcoin's price looks like it's going to keep losing value, then people will move their holdings that to something isn't losing value as much. This is just how the market works. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:20:48
Nah don't think so, seen it plenty of times when we were green. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:16:49
Well I am now after watching these market charts these last few days. Not going to give these fucking e-shrinks any of my bitcoins though, I got bacardi to get me through. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 09:10:06
but muh rights! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:04:26
You're holding the bag alright. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:11:03
It can't buy you a meal. A small snack maybe. A real meal would be around 2~4 USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:27:45
It's really fucking sad. I actually used to spend some of my bitcoin on things too. The fees killed that entire sector overnight. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:17:58
Holy fuck burning money like the joker. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:23:44
Eventually you may need to consider giveing up hodling, or the only thing you'll up hodling is the bag. And that's not something you will enjoy hodling, beleive me. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:05:38
Nope. BTC has lost many of advantages. There's just no point to pump it into 40k because it's not anywhere near worth that much. If you want huge gains look into some other coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:31:02
I feel like I've thrown enough money back into bitcoin as is. And now it just punishes me by going into the red every day. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:27:59
The last place for it to go was left. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:00:03
I think you're still gambling tbh. But at least you've got better odds now. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:54:56
Their lives sure would be easier if crypto had wider adoption...same goes for everyone else paid in CC. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:36:43
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:58:20
It probably meant to say technical analysis. I don't think I've ever actually seen a "well written fundamental analysis report" posted here before. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:01:56
Yeah that's gone. Was a cute little project we use to do here though. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:16:49
Nah they only take cash. Just search for bitcoin on BP. Most of the results are from a guy selling bitcoin consulting. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:21:46
They only converted cash to BTC in order to buy drugs with so they really shouldn't have any regrets other than not spending their BTC in time before SR got taken down. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:58:10
Nope 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:31:06
Time to cut the umbilical cord my friend.
