They're quite cause they SODL.

Better make sure that's a good magnet, don't want that key falling under the fridge.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:57:48
should be ok, you'll just have to trade your BCH for BTC once you get it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:29:42
just sell it to an exchange, they'll give you an address to send it to, but i'd hold.

@_date: 2016-01-03 04:34:58
If that rocks your boat, sure.
Doubt a normal person would want to though.
@_date: 2016-01-03 00:02:03
What could you possibly be hiding?
Whatever it is, since you're hiding it, it's bound to be something you shouldn't have done.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:15:49
Fork you, you can fork right off.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:05:07
Dig in!
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:18:08
it's not stealing when you "give" it to him...
@_date: 2016-11-13 05:53:53
I don't understand, are they just stupid?
Deposit old note, get card.
Or are they just all that corrupt that cashless is unthinkable?
edit: in any case, best to rip the band aid off, they can start getting over it sooner.
@_date: 2016-11-13 06:26:52
so basically, if they let retailers exchange first, this wouldn't have been a problem?
@_date: 2016-12-03 06:31:12
Don't fool yourself into thinking there is any other way to deal with something so savage/rabid
Edit: Fine, there is, but a bullet to the head seems a bit extreme, let the monkeys be and deal with them only when you have to.
Edit2: These are fully grown adults with zero discipline, if you think that's acceptable in anyway, you belong with them, because you're just as fucking retarded

1 mil a day is nothing on a global scale.
This could be a problem if bitcoin was only in a village or something...
@_date: 2012-02-08 08:22:00
How ridiculous, and these people are supposed to know computers, how the hell do they think some conscripts are gonna take on elites?
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:59:28
Never heard of "Crazy Ivan" huh?
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:28:40
Remember this day, men, for it will be yours for all time!
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:37:35
You buy the dip and you hold.
When the only person selling one wants 30k, it's 30k.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:00:22
Give them nothing!!!
But take from them, Everything!
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:37:22
Many Satoshi
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:18:14
I'm still going!
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:54:23
I just saw the market cap jump 300m after pressing f5 in 2 minutes...
Shits gone crazy yo!
Edit: At this rate, we're not going to have a moon!
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:36:56
afaik "none of your business" is perfectly legitimate for a personal loan.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:49:59
Looking forward to "You're shit at dying" for altcoins
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:00:13
It's mentioned in the first episode of this seasons Z Nation too.
"It's happening!!!"
@_date: 2011-08-22 22:54:11
had a good laugh at this doofus a few days ago, couldn't sit through it all.
@_date: 2011-08-22 23:39:48
cpu's are the most efficient thermal generators in existence.
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:34:11
It would require a sophisticated AI, but I imagine it is possible.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:39:42
:) 
Perhaps I should have been clearer in naming BCC
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:07:34
What happens when only hodlers are left?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:57:09
F5 ddos attack :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:44:27
Now don't crash or you have a day of reindexing! 
Seriously, why does it roll back ALL the way?
@_date: 2011-08-22 21:50:58
bitcoins won't die, simply from the criminal element that has associated itself with them, they have funds comparable to governments.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:19:33
alright alright, give me a minute.
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:36:04
you often buy other countries currencies?
Edit: you're not selling money when you trade it for goods and services.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:56:48
Oh so this is funny but my rocket slamming into the ground isn't :'(
Have your upvote...
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:27:47
It's a currency, you're not meant to sell it.
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:10:19
I'm aware of the tax laws surrounding bitcoin, and they were hastily slapped together, hence being treated as a security.
And it's not burning, there are several retailers that accept it with more on the horizon, it is a currency, a global one.
