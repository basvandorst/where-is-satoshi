Also for binance I checked some of the reviews and alot of them mention slow withdrawls and performance in general. Did you find this to be true?

I'm wonderinh how I would be able to transfer my coinbase coins to my smartphone wallet. Do you recommend any wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:47:13
Thanks! Should I use the coinbase app or do you recommend electrum?

Thanks, I was looking at quadrigacx since im in canada and they wanted 18 + users while coinbase only needed 17+. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:21:02
do you know if they allow trading from canada?

yea I made a mistake of buying some tonight after seeing the price skyrocket. I regret it and now im trying to sell it out and lower my investment
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:35:43
How would you short it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:20:41
Is it a mobile app? I searched google but couldn't find out much about it. Do you think its reliable ans safe enough to use with my lg phone?

except that bitcoin itself slow and noone wants to use it as a currency anymore. Its just a store of value for poor college kids to blow their money into while whales get rich off of it

do you think it would work on the lg g5? Sorry for any trouble but thanks for your help.

I bought my first bit of bitcoin while I was 17... Would I still have to document that for taxes?

My bad shouldve mentioned it in the post, I want to sell my bitcoin but I'm under 18 and I don't want to use my parents id. I've made enough of a profit off bitcoin and my selling amount is under $1000. The place i'm going to has a relatively low fee so I don't mind it at all.

What do you think about bitcoin atms? theres a few near my house, should I use them? Do they require ID to show im over 18 and can I transfer from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:03:58
oh ok thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:49:35
yea i know but im really afraid of the whole bitcoin futures thing and the huge increases that have happened
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:36
I was thinking about selling actually, do you think a 3-8% fee is reasonable?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:47:47
So i can sell it using bittrex but not buy?
