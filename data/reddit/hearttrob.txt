Are there any downsides to opera? Not to sure I ever heard about it.

I'll give that a shot. I just know sometimes this community has really good sources. I've seen a lot of it but always forget to save the good shit.

Twitter just doesn't know how to handle this. Every coin is loaded with scammer bots that it's honestly getting ridicoulous.

this is actually huge news because they are starting to recognize it as a currency more now. It's going to be really huge when congress finally makes the IRS treat crypto as an actual currency.

I don't think people worship him. People just relate to him because what he went through is something nearly everyone here goes through when they try trading. In fact ever since that hodl thing started he probably saved people a lot of money. The only reason hodl became a thing is because it was and probably still is 100% valid. Most people that try trading in this market end up losing and that's what started HODL.

Dumb question but we are basically looking for the 24 word seed?  What do you guys use to test out the 24 words to see if they work?

I disagree. I think it is revolutionary by a lot. Anyone can create their own shitcoin so that's irelevant and doesn't really have anything to do with bitcoin.  
  
I encourage you to watch this video that simply explains how fiat is the biggest scam in history which we should all know by now and when this finally becomes common sense to the average person, that's when the revolution begins.  
  
 
And just so you know that video has nothing to do with bitcoin or crypto, just someone simply educating how corrupt fiat is and how we are slaves to it. But if you know how bitcoin works you can see how revolutionary it would be in this case.

wow you're retarded. Some of the most creative artists and creative minds come from those neighborhoods. And of course they're cool, they have personality and character where as the 'normal' neighborhoods are bland and boring and have no character hence why everyone flocks to where it's cool and then they fucking ruin it when marketing follows them.

you state that most people only have it for it's volatility but what makes you say that most people are in this catergory? I ask because when I was a noob, the prices did lure me in when it first hit 2k but the more I read about bitcoin and it's revolutionary capabilites I quickly was in it for the technology and could care less about the price. How do you know that most people don't fall in this catergory?

great interview with neautral vibes, no emotions and even a handsome dude!

I never heard of Helix but it might be a little fishy that the link you provided doesn't use a secured htlm. I feel like any company trying to make a name would use a secure website

Andreas is traveling the world going to events non stop for bitcoin. Do you think he's really staring at this sub? He probably barely comes to this sub anymore.  
  
Censorship on a sub is the least of his worries lol. And I don't think it's that censored. It's primarily a bitcoin sub that's meant to talk about just bitcoin. These mods do have a lot of work to do considering this being the biggest sub in crypto where people are always attacking it. The censorship was destined to happen eventually as some kind of control or else this place would heavily get spammed by trolls/other crypto's. We are almost at 1 million subs..
