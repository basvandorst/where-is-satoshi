Heard about it from my brother. He was into surfing the dark web and told me about Silk Road and how you paid with bitcoin. 6 months later, my friend approached me at a bar about pooling our money into bitcoin since it was the next big thing. I told him he was full of shit and there's no way it'll take off.
4 years later I started buying in lol

Don't worry about it....it's 60 bucks loss. Technically you could claim a short term capital loss on your taxes and receive a benefit on your return...but, assuming low income since you're a student, that'll save you like $6 in tax. But, you'll have to use turbo tax pro or some other paid software which will cost you $50. Not worth it.

Murphy's law,  I was pulling my pizza out of the oven (and burning myself) when it happened

All really good points. I agree that if you were to do business in bitcoin, ultimately it is up to your risk tolerance.  It is similar to any other asset management strategy by a business, just a very volatile one. 
That returns issue is a good point that I hadn't thought of. I can only imagine dealing with customers returning goods after a large spike or cliff in BTC price haha.
Ultimately, some people smarter than I am will probably come up with some pretty nifty strategies to both mitigate risk and increase profits using BTC. There's a reason some of those foreign exchange people make a bundle, and I bet the same would be said for BTC if it becomes mainstream.

That's a good point, the percentage of BTC coming in is probably much smaller than your profit margin so cash flow may not be affected so much.
I guess a hypothetical would be if a large purchase came in and they wanted to pay in bitcoin, so much so that it skewed your cash. Then the question remains, how much do you keep and how much do you convert? Like the person above said, it would all hinge on your risk tolerance. Cash management can be hard enough, hopefully you're savvy and can make it work to your benefit.
