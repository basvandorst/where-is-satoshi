Ok? So he rants? Who cares? We all know this...it doesn’t make him unintelligent or give us proof of his illiteracy...you can’t judge the entirety of his character and intelligence from his speaking style...I’ll give you a fine example of someone proving my point, Nikola Tesla while being one of the the greatest minds the world has seen, talked to pigeons in his spare time. 
I think you may be judging him to harshly for his unorthodox speaking style.
He’s had some great speeches you can check out if you’d like to see the other side.

You know how many NBA players, NFL stars, musician, actors and lottery winners lose all of their money? It’s not easy to lose hundreds of millions either.
DT inherited some of his wealth but grew it substantially AND more importantly, maintained it. I think you are undermining his intelligence my friend.
