if you assume BTC will stay this exact price, yes.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:25:02
Downtrend? Where?
It went up quite rapidly over several days and hit 13.8k
then in a matter of an hour it dumped down. I think that was just a mass sell off that was always going to come, it hadn't been that high for ages. It has then trended back up slowly ever since. If you ask me its showing that it has a lot of support here now
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:14:02
OK, would that entice enough miners to stay online for bitcoin to function correctly?
If more and more people adopt this currency and start using it day to day, wouldn't the demand for transactions increase?
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:12:52
No worries, I was so confused lol
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:22:57
I like how only some people can say „this" instead of "this"
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:16:23
Yes, you potentially would.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:00:04
Sorry if this is a silly question,
If the miners are performing the algorithms needed to confirm bitcoin transactions, what will happen when all or most of the Bitcoin is mined and (i imagine) most of the miners will go offline? Who will process all the transactions in the blockchain?

yeah by the angle the photo was taken it looks like a sneaky snap. I dont think she knew he was taking the photo

its from Feb and it's, as i predicted, an ETH farm:
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:32:04
nah its an ETH farm
see: 
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:44:22
yeah but they are most probably mining ETH or some other alt like ZCASH since they are video cards and not ASICs
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:03:11
ah ok
if makes you feel any better he may have downvoted me too lol
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:30:32
no one downvoted you bruh we are all agreeing with you
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:07:39
the 12k to 13k pump and dump continues
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:09:29
12K is here!
edit for about 10 seconds.
strong resistance at 12k
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:05:47
yeah its hard to believe but its seems set to be an even stronger than 2017 end of year
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:58:08
this bull run is steeper than end of 2017
it might punch past 20k with no issue at this rate
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:33:29
the comment underneath yours
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:26:10
good thing is, probably by the end of the year, no one would have bought above the price it is at.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:35:04
buy and hold lads.
Enjoy the ride
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:14:13
the 996 will probably hold at this low price for a 911 Porsche and i think might start going up in the future if they are looked after
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:02:00
only going to get worse? the may have bought in at 4k and  more than tripled their money
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:10:30
SHH no one say anything about it being 13k. You'll wake the SODLers
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:43:51
I'm simply saying that some people put sell orders in at 12k since that is when they want to cash out. It's a round number thats why there is resistance there. That's all
Of course its going to be a great year for Bitcoin. No one is arguing that nor am i.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:04:39
im so glad i bought some more btc earlier today holy shit
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:14:13
people have a ton of auto sell orders set up at 12k.
once we bump against 12k a few more times they will deplete and it will rise over it
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:31:18
whats with all the 0.0018 transactions?
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:20:56
yeah, we almost needed this year to allow shitcoins to sink
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:27:09
not intelligent? if they bought at 4k and sold now they tripled their money.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:27:37
i think it might flip and 12k will be support
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:53:10
i never understood people who said "bitcoin us dead" when it was plateau at ~4k or whatever. 
It's 4K a coin. Show me a stronger currency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:56:26
he meant splitting the income so the scenario 2.
He is saying the only way that gets you a tax break is if you are trying to avoid the high tax bracket that you may go in for a high amount of capital gains for that financial year.
i think thats what he meant, i am by no means an accountant or good with finance lol
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:04:53
um yes
also this is why the price goes up then massive drop, if some big whale has a sell order at $x usd then it just sells huge amounts off. Once we chip through those we will start rising at a moderate pace (until the next price point that has large volume of orders i guess)
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:11:17
coinbase has the best bank support so everyone flocks to it

i've always wondered why you can't edit the title of a Reddit post.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:45:26
~40% increase in 30 days
That is bullish
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:12:08
wouldn't i need 2 lamb (o)s to breed more?
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:57:11
yup but it may have caused a domino effect shifting the market back bullish.
The market is what we make it. If we all decide we are bullish on bitcoin then it will be bullish.

can i buy my kids a lambo for college though if it moons?
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:54:45
Good idea! how do you enforce that?
@_date: 2019-05-20 04:32:41
1. bitcoin price rises
2. mainstream media start noticing it again
3. negative news story
4. people panic and sell
5. bitcoin price drops
6. repeat from step 1
