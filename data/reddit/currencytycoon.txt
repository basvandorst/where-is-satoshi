Actually, you can pay for that access with a credit card, by paying the pools directly to include your transaction in the next block. Here's a few

According to Wikileaks cables, this bank, Danske Bank, helped finance Tanchon, a North Korean trading company that sold ballistic missiles to Iran:

ok can you guys stop trolling
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:50:56
You got me there. I was indeed trolling... Sorry, pretty bad of me to do and don't know why I did it. It was probably because you were so defensive, but you don't really need to defend your position so much. To even think that segwit bitcoins are worth more than non-segwit bitcoins requires a lot of mental gymnastics and delusions. 
Again, I apologize to have ticked you off, I know I shouldn't do that. This is crypto and we are all in this together.
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:04:07
Yeah, there is. Just as long as you don't send your coins to a non-segwit address, your bitcoins will remain non-segwit forever. Non-segwit bitcoins are becoming more rare each day!
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:08:32
You could technically send the non-Segwit coins back, however, there's a limit to how much bitcoin can be sent to it, because the supply of segwit bitcoins is limited, and most people want to avoid fees, so they won't do this. Also, not everyone owns a non-segwit address created before Aug 2017, those are the addresses I value more, think of it as blockchain memorabilia. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:33:39
If only I kept my non-segwit bitcoins... They'd be worth something now!
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:21:23
I can relate. Wanted to pay for something last month, they had a BTC option which redirected to BitPay, who didn't show a bitcoin address.

The bitcoin script docs mention that there a two stacks indeed. Main stack and alt stack: 
The problem is that there is a limit to how much you can push on the stacks, and the stacks don't get saved into secondary storage, so no, it's not Turing complete in practice. However, nothing really is in  practice - since everything has a limited amount of storage &amp; resources. Eg, your iMac is Turing complete until you pull the cord...

Thanks for the link. Just looked at it closely, indeed alt stack is useless in that regard. Oh well.

Bitcoin has a [scripting system]( that mimics a 'pushdown automation' 
An interesting point about the Bitcoin script machine is that it has two stacks, not one. It has been [proven]( that a Turing machine is equal to a two stack pushdown automation, so there's no need for any additional papers. 
Although all of that is just theory coming straight out of a computer science textbook. Bitcoin doesn't offer a reliable secondary storage and is very limited to the number of ops you can do with the script for each txn, so it's very stunted in practice.

So let me get this... Barry Silbert, a non-technical dude with a finance background, will finally settle the blocksize debate with a secret back-room deal? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:49:42
No problem. in 5 years, we'll probably have 100TB consumer drives. Another 5, 1 petabyte drives (or more).
edit: and your coins will be worth so much that you'll be able to afford the best hard drive money can buy ;-)
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:10:06
Barry &amp; Co. doing secret back-room deals is the very definition of a cartel. And no, I didn't downvote you (everyone is entitled to their opinion), someone else did..

"Either way, our building sized mine would consume 21 megawatts of power"
21 MW is nothing...
To compare, average power consumption of a Boeing 747 is 140 MW. Source

Technology changes things at a rapid pace, and the pace is accelerating.
Just to think, a company eBay such as would not have been possible if it wasn't from the disruption bought by the Internet..
Now a new disruption is about to take place.
eBay has to either shift gears and go embrace new technology, or get left behind...
