One does not have to understand the underlying mechanism for it to work. At least not when it is well implemented. 
I'm sure every new technology will have some hassle associated with it to begin with - but give it a little time and i'm sure it will all be hassle free.

But I still have to pay 0.001 btc to move my coins form Kraken.

Actually its not alibaba it need to happen on. It's Alipay! (the chinese version of Paypal (with way less fees and way more security)).
That ~~could~~ **would** be revolutionary for the use of chinese money services.

But what about the fact that "bus 2" never reacted on the fact that they had the same tyre-type as "bus 1"? - But first reacted after "bus 1" did? 
It's under my understanding the problem have been known since 2011?

You guys should seriously consider to say sorry to MtGox instead of keep blaming them for every problem you have.
As I see it; MtGox did the right thing as the first and others are following... Still you guys are seeing MtGox as the bad guy, just because their money withdrawals are plugged.
I can really not wrap my head around how you can make this look like Bitstamp is perfect and that MtGox sucks.

Don't know if it has anything to do about this. But I just lost all of my blockchain bitcoins..

Just so you know: I'm sending it from Denmark.

What I get from that is:
I still have no info at all on bitstamp... There is nothing in their FAQ.
But thanks about the Coinbase info:
* SEPA transfer from EU -&gt; exchange ?? (0?)
* Buying of bitcoins (abount 1 BTC): 1% (min. $0.15 or £0.15)
* Transfer of bitcoins to paper wallet:  0.0002 BTC
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:41:13
They do not accept non-us credit cards.
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:09:01
I decided to buy at Coinbase even thought they just buy their bitcoins at Bitstamp themselves.
I picked Coinbase because i got mad at Bitstamp for their missing transparency for both fees and waiting time for processing of bank transfers.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:10:00
It does not seem like they support Creditcard in EU?
But they do claim that it will only take 1-2 days to register a SEPA transfer. But it sucks that I have to pay about 10 usd to make a SEPA transfer from my bank...

I don't even doubt that they could have your words if they want them, especially because they have probably been typed/showed/generated on a computer that at some later point has had connected to the internet.
But that accounts for practically everyone with bitcoins. Even the ones taking big precursions... 
But as we know from WW2, the fact that they might know most wallets, is only usefully if people don't know that they know it.
In other words, if you are not a very big target, people like NSA is probably not going to mess with you or your money. It's just not worth risking getting caught knowing it. 
When that is said. Change it. Generate the words on an offline computer that will never get connected to the internet again, roll a dice a couple of times, change the words the corresponds to the positions with some random words you pick yourself. And then never ever store, say or write these words on any device that is connected to the internet in any way.

The problem is that (for now) proof of stake does not work. It has some quiet serious flaws.
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:57:33
Sure, but you have to understand that a lot of people that invest in bitcoin don't actually live in countries where they are scared that they will loose their money when they are in the bank.
These people do understand why Bitcoin is needed in other parts of the world, but the NEED is not there in their country at this time at least. 
This is the reason that some people have other initiatives as to why they invest in Bitcoin; like earning money.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:38:27
You move them to an offline wallet ..
This does two things for you.
1. Keep it secure. I'm talking from experience (got goxxed)
2. Keeps you from panic selling when you really should not panic sell.

Seems likes you added two 0's too many at the "Guessing any bitcoin private key with a balance". There is 00 as a decimal. Furthermore it seems like you took these two 0's into your calculation which made an error in amount of times one should win a powerball in a row.
I calculated it to 8 powerballs in a row instead with your numbers.

I'm quiet sure that the value of bitcoins has nothing to do with its ability to be used as a currency. You know that you can split a Bitcoin in satoshis? It's 0.00000001 btc.. that's about 0.00007 usd at today's price. By your logic then think about how shitty usd is? 
Furthermore I do not think that the meme drama on Reddit means anything at all for the actual value of btc. Just like the EA drama on Reddit did nothing for the EA stock price.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:35:44
You know what. Originally I said to myself that I would supply when it went under 6000. Then I read all this crap about how it would fall to 3000, and I held onto my fiat. 
Thanks Reddit. You are really helping me out to make bad decisions.

Oh by that means I think that you are just too early on the trend. Give it 8-12 years to let everything settle and getting it to be an accepted currency. Change takes time, especially when it is a change against the biggest forces (money holders) in the world.
We are not going to make Bitcoin a mainstream banking system in a few years. That takes time, fights and acceptance. When that is said. See how long we've come in just ~10 years. Give it another 10 years and I think we will be at a point where the price may be as stable as the USD/gold price.
This is also why I'm not trading with the majority of my bitcoins. They are not a fast trading investment. They are a potential investment for life. It's a gamble yes. But if bitcoins does become some sort of standard world currency (which they have a lot of potential to do) or maybe just a gold replacement I will probably be set for life. I won't gamble that away for a couple more %.
But you are correct. At the current time Bitcoin is too volatile to be a replacement for your day to day money usage. Especially if you live in a country where you somewhat trust your government and your banks.

My point is: what if the Pi/arduino/whatever for some reason loses internet connection - or the API you get the price from gets changed or closes down - or is just down for maintenance. You wouldn't know. It would make sense to indicate (eg. In the Bitcoin logo) that the number on the screen is actually not outdated. It could be hours or days old for all you know..
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:19:28
You should make some kind of indicator that indicates if the numbers are fresh or not. Either have a timestamp on the information, or maybe just a color indicator if the number has for some reason not been updated in x time.

Well we keep putting new technologies on top of the basic blockchain, like the lightning network. This means that you will have a smaller and smaller need for actually making a transaction on the base chain itself. 
In other words there will come A LOT of new users. This will make more transactions and therefore probably a lower fee. Furthermore the systems on top of the chain will probably be the ones one usually use and they would have a way lower fee! 
But see how far we are now... We have a lot of years to invent the perfect systems and technologies for this. In part we can thank all the altcoins for doing a lot of the testing needed to know when it is secure and viable to implement such technologies onto Bitcoin. 
This is also why many people thinks Bitcoin lacks after and think that one crazy coin is the new thing! They show a new technology a new way of transactions.. but really Bitcoin is just waiting for people on the crazy coin to do the testing - and if it is worth implementing then it will. But not before there is consensus that the technology is secure and viable on the Bitcoin blockchain. And that's exactly what makes Bitcoin worth money. It's the secure option.
