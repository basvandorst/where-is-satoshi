You have to talk with your lawyer! they must understand not to mess with their customers man!
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:17:05

@_date: 2017-02-22 15:04:37
Today i received a mail telling me that my Blockchain mail address has been changed. and there was a link to a fake Blockchain site.. It was asking my username-pass..
@_date: 2016-03-30 20:38:11
something i never heard about.. What is your way to explain this?
@_date: 2016-03-20 22:01:36
Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:09:13
Which one you are talking about? 
I knew that for most of them you are able to change the fee...
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:53:04
Trezor or Ledger
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:37:23
Did he say 0.06J per Gh?
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:53:02
it is not an official website. So ''BitFury'' still does not sell to the public i believe.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:26:10
Triple check!
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:53:07

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:54:12

@_date: 2017-03-07 20:30:12
Did not know that..
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:08:56
So if it is diversifying, why is that actually?
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:22:02
Can you add auto connect feature ? Once the router goes off and on my btc screen says no connection and i have to unplug and plug back the cable to restart connection every time router goes off..
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:15:31

@_date: 2017-01-04 14:38:21
Okay, Thanks.. will be waiting that update..
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:16:03
I think so..
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:42:33

Hey, do you still update the device? Because i do not receive any update mails..
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:29:06
I bought mine a year ago.. I reaaly like it! you should buy one..
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:09:28
Yes fuck your life. you should never sell it.
@_date: 2016-12-31 14:32:20
Bro do not post ''Bitcoin is 1337'' I nearly had heart attack.. Add the currency as well !
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:34:59
I think he will add these in the future if we say that we need and we want.. You can always update your device with an afkdata update program.. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 11:30:48
I thought it was Canada..
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:49:34

@_date: 2016-02-07 01:26:03
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:32:23
The price would be much higher than we expect. If it is illegall, it is hard to reach.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:32:53
I knew that virtual products are not covered by ''buyer protection''
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:51:36
i do not think so... Do not buy any virtual product on these platforms.
