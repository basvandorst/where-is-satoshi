After speaking with the owner tonight, this question came up (when we bought btc). No ID is required. He legally has to record your name,  address and phone number, he said.

As long as I promptly receive the 3.38 BTC which I purchased, I'll be ok. When will the BTC be delivered?

So I dont create another thread, I'll ask for help here. Placed order about 40 hours ago for USD to BTC. No BTC arrived within a couple hours, so I opened support case on the website. No response, so I emailed support 18 hours ago. No response from that yet either. This wouldn't be a big deal except the price has increased from $71 to $98 :/ Can you help get my order processed and help me avoid losing a bunch of money due to the order delay and price increase?
Any help is appreciated!

Whats the usual turn around time on responses? Hate to blow you guys up (BI has been great til this), but I've been waiting 36+ hours for a USD to BTC transfer and 34+ hours for a reply via my message through that channel. I emailed support last night, but nothing back yet. If you can help me, that'd be awesome. It sucks that BTC has gone from $71 to $98 since I placed my order :(. Can you help me out with that price increase so I dont lose a bunch of money?
thanks for reading

Yes! I see the BTC deposited and confirmed about an hour ago. Its 3.2 instead of the expected 3.38, but I'll chalk that up to the exchange rate being a few $ different than I anticipated. Thank you for your help with this!

Hi. I used USD to BTC Address. I'm becoming more concerned about this since the price of BTC is now around $120 (up from the $71 when i placed the order). I still haven't heard back on either of my support requests via the website and via email. The sooner we get this resolved, the less it will cost you to make things right and the sooner I *will* go back to recommending your service (which I've really liked before this issue!)
Please process my order and send 3.38 BTC (My calculation: $240.025 USD after your 3.99% fee @ $71 per BTC) to my address 1Cs9A7nKBMknSPWGKDh69Pad2az8wXNDJx . Thanks for your help

Python illiterate here... can you expand on step "????" ? I have python installed and edited the "FIXME" fieled for the API key and secret, but get an error when running arbitrage.py:
* ...arbitrage-master\src\arbitrage.py", line 165, in main
    import argparse
ImportError: No module named argparse"
edit: Not sure what caused that, but it executes fine on another computer.

Hi. I need this resolved and have given you my order info twice before this message. Its been 7 days since I placed my order and there has been no response from support via my submission on your contact page or my email to them (7 days since I first contacted them). 
**You have my money but I don't have my goods after a week. This is not acceptable**
**Please send 3.38 BTC to my address 1Cs9A7nKBMknSPWGKDh69Pad2az8wXNDJx in reference to order number 23d00b97-2278-4634-9735-4eaba2d1a62f placed at 02:50 on 4/17 promptly.**
I do appreciate your help and its regrettable that we have to have this exchange in public view on reddit.

Hi, yep I did that a few hours after I saw the transaction hadn't completed (so thatd be roughly 05:00 GMT 4/17 since the transaction was done around 02:50 GMT 4/17). I got a receipt confirmation email. About 18 hours later I emailed support since I hadnt received a reply from the web form. No reply to that yet either. Quote ID is 23d00b97-2278-4634-9735-4eaba2d1a62f. Is that what you need?

Thanks for the reply. I did receive the confirmation email that my case was received. Sure - I can continue waiting on the support team if I can get the bitcoins for $71 rather than the current price when the transaction executes. I'm not in a particular hurry for them, but I am concerned about getting the original price that I expected.
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:15:14
I've given you my order info twice, so not sure what you mean about not having it. Please resolve this promptly and provide the original amount of bitcoins that I purchased several days ago. Will you take care of that?
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:42:15
Hi. I appreciate your responses, but its been 65 hours since I submitted my first inquiry via your main support channel. If you can assure me that they can provide me with 3.38 BTC, then I'll continue waiting. I'm frustrated with the lack of response from the support team and very concerned that I will lose money in this instance of using your service. Can you assure me that they will be able to deliver the original 3.38 BTC that I ordered at 02:00 GMT on 4/17? Roughly how long is the backlog in the support queue?

You've had better luck than I with Glad someone got their problem resolved. I've had several messages with that person below and nothing is resolved yet (7 days later)
