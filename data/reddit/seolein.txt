So the goal for the miner is to increase the guesses per second what he will need more computer power for?

Bitcoin doesn’t care, Bitcoin does its thing, Bitcoin is smart, be like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:48:44
but isn´t it more like a lottery then rather than a mathematical task ?
@_date: 2019-03-21 22:22:07
Be careful, this is not a real bit coin, it doesn’t show the bit coin logo.

No wonder nobody knows who the real Satoshi is if there so many.
@_date: 2019-03-06 11:08:09

So we are bringing them western technology. With it will come western lifestyle, that means their diet will get worse, people will have to learn how to live with back pain, psychotherapy jobs will be booming and personal debts will increase and people will loose the connection to nature.
Sure this is a good thing ? I think there are many aspects in their lives that we can learn from. Helping a country with poor economy does not necessarily mean we will improve the personal lives of the population.
Bitcoin might still be a good thing though as for the obvious reasons (take away control from banks etc) - my post above was more a general view.

They are basically the Tether for Fiat

Is this a Tether rebranding ?

Be careful guys, Vitaly is the only real one who actually sends you something back, but it‘s ETH not BTC!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:34:26

@_date: 2019-01-04 14:26:05
this is what Tether is dreaming of
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:43:32
Maybe Bitfinex is cashing out their BTC which they accumulated with their fake USD tethers that they just produce out of thin air ?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:37:09
Can we please get this to the press? As much as Jamie's words made all the headlines last week, now again it's time to notify the masses what is going on. I also want to see some journalist confronting Jamie with this and asking him on TV to explain this.
My favorite question for the end would be "Dear Jamie, don't you think this is market manipulation?"

Appearently she told the guys behind the scenes the first two coins to be added would be Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Such wow.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:15:22

So better option would be switching internet off on my Macbook and then printing it from there ?
Or first run a malware check on the mac ?

Thats why I save the website first and generate the key when offline... 
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:38:24
not really.... I just think chances are really small as it is a really big office and so many people are there and use the printer etc
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:04:23
how about buying a cheap small laptop (11" or smth) to be only offline and using a desktop wallet on it ?
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:39:44
can you tell me more about that ? especially how to make an offline and disposable OS ? any links ?
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:25:27
