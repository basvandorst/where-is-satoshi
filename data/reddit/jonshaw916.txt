I don't think fiat is useless. I keep a majority of my money in fiat for bills, food, and making money. I just think you should have enough saved in paper currency to cover a few months of expenses before delving into crypto (or any investment for that matter. I wouldn't go buy an ounce of gold if my net worth was $1500)
