Shitposting on reddit, I'd assume.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:25:14
How am I supposed to find all my taxable events from exchanges that don't even exist anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:20
Elon Musk if you want to be more present-time.

This kind of stupid shit belongs in @_date: 2014-07-04 14:42:30
So you can only have one emotion at a time? You can't be both relieved and shocked at the same time?
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:05:32
I agree with this post, this is why I stick to rather than the shitposting that goes on around here.

This is a very very early version of face to face bitcoin payments, I feel that we are a long way yet from optimal bitcoin payment methods. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:06:04
I'd like to think that it went pretty well, but it probably didn't. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 10:03:08
Wow, that is art.
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:43:50
The inconsistent typeface is killing my eyes.
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:08:15
430 what? Bananas?
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:16:23
Should be mBTC, mB would confuse people into thinking its megabytes or something. Of course, a symbol that represents mBTC would be best.
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:58:43
You wouldn't be relieved if you managed to get 800 bitcoins un-stuck from somewhere and back into your own wallet?
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:06:29
Nice logic m8
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:34:55
I thought it was hilarious.
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:22:06
News reporters still seem like they haven't got their head around how the BTC price of things does not stay constant.
Also, we seriously need make people aware of the different naming conventions, such as millibits. This would make it a lot less awkward to say "zero point zero zero zero one two three four five bitcoins".
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:02:53
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:58:19
Nice shit post OP. Moving along.
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:39:28
Wow cool! Hold on let me post every single thing that I have bought with Bitcoin onto this subreddit as well!
What a complete shitpost. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:48:39
Still far less energy used than the energy it takes to cast coins and print paper money.
@_date: 2014-11-14 09:56:53
Who upvotes this shit?

You should probably not spend $100 on something that probably hasn't even been tested yet.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:54:15
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:20:26
Looks like the quality of posts are going to get even more childish and meme-y.
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:50:59
It was Mr. Fourchin I heard.
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:50:39
A fix would be better than a workaround. You know we can't just convert 100% of Windows users like that.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:00:18
I see what you mean.
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:52:51
This is definitely not biased or anything :\^)
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:58:23
That's like saying you wouldn't spend money ever, because the currency you use to buy things is rising in value.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:54:42
W-what in the world is this article? 
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:46:41
There was a thread not long ago with the title '600!' and you didn't complain there about the currency not being specified.
Typical american right here.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:27:48
We are in after all.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:03:00
So what exactly do you think this post means, then?
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:29:00
Well, gold used to be used as currency. There was no inflation. We could have currency in the future that does not inflate.
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:12:21
I would rather use Milli-Bitcoins or Millibits for short, and mBTC as the abbreviation.. Bits on its own is way too generic and could easily be mis-interpreted.
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:37:40
I downvoted this thread because it doesn't mention the word 'moon'.
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:02:55
Not going to happen. Supermarkets and landlords who would accept bitcoin would want to immediately convert to their local currency. With no exchanges, they can't do that.
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:39:55
Splitting the userbase with forks is not that big a deal if it doesn't involve money. But it does involve money. Not quite elegant in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:13:18
You must grow weed or some shit.
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:50:10
That's silly.
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:46:43
I still don't think you get the point. If Bitcoin were at that value, you'd probably be able to pay for everything IN Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-28 23:49:28
I think OP meant 10,000 Great American Sheckels
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:40:26
Gambling your cash away is a great way to become even poorer. This is not advice for someone without a gambling addiction.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:10:54
Thanks for your insight.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:29:01
That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation, I completely agree.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:33:55
You have a gambling problem. Sell everything and put your money back in your bank account because you are going to mess up your life with this recklessness.
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:41:40
edgy comment, dude
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:44:20
thank you for this insightful contribution to the discussion.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:56:01
Why would you even want to cash out at 5 dollars? Is your strategy to buy high and sell low? Using a time lock, OP wouldn't be able to chicken out when there are flash crashes. Any amount of weak-handedness would be prevented by a lock.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:36:01
Meme misusage at its finest. @_date: 2017-11-07 14:40:25
Which is inherently 'centralised' because it's your ISP that supplies you with said internet connection.
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:21:31
Atrocious. Programmers should really just stay far, far away from web design. They don't even realise how bad it looks.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:44:15
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:45:24
The way you asked was quite low effort. You didn't even specify that you were asking if they accepted bitcoins as a form of payment. For the uninitiated, they might have not known what you were even talking about.
You got a low effort reply back. Seems reasonable to me. Your behaviour is childish and unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:12:07
It looks terrible, so no wonder everyone is trying to destroy it. The circle isn't even round.
@_date: 2015-10-09 06:49:32
Well meme'd
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:49:06
Instead we get some irrelevant GIF that makes the community look like children.

It's an EP not an album.
@_date: 2013-07-01 03:43:28
You just got Gox'd.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:34:37
And then this defies the point in Bitcoin. It's a digital currency, it should be used digitally, and it *should* be secure digitally.
I'm pretty sick of seeing physical bitcoins and paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:08:49
His friend here, I asked the same question and he told me his wallet was encrypted with a 10+ character password that was unique (not used on any other site).
I'm answering on his behalf because he had to go to work.
