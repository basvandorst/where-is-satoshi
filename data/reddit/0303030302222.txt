So let me get this straight, you have Tor support, you expect vendors to acquire and secure a server? Why would a vendor who only usually sells a handful of different items need to have an entire website? 
Also this was already done if unsuccessfully, it was called Bitwasp, though its aim was to be a darkmarket platform not a e-shop, this resulted in hacked markets run by kids. 
Alright ill throw you a bone you seem talented, best not to waste it, if you want to create something then you have to be p2p, the only reason the current tor markets are up is someone with the nuts and brains to put a site up like that is willing to for the millions payoff they can get when they run with the money, face it the server client architecture is a sitting duck in torland. But this is where OB went wrong, their version of p2p is well...they screwed themselves when they shifted into a udp only network, now maybe i2p would have worked if i2p had any bitcoin support whatsoever, so forget OB. 
You literally need to take the bittorrent protocol and hack it to update its datastore in realtime, like freenet but without all the cryptobloat. Now obviously you hit the brick wall of how do i keep spammers from ruining the network by pushing junkdata, proof of work model might work, make it computationally expensive. This is really key though, if the datastore of the network is on everyones computer and not just one then the rest works itself out, like OB requires buyers to download software, this is a dealkiller. Sites could act as front ends for the distributed network allowing people to login through their browser and it would take the pressure off the gateway owner because hey he is not running a market just a webportal for a network. 
IMO the nextgen market trophy is still up for grabs, gl.
