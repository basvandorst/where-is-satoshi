If a transaction isn't yet confirmed, is it possible the customer can broadcast another transaction which transfers all their funds to another address they own minus a fairy 'hefty' transaction fee (which just has to be less than what they are purchasing from you of course) so as to, shall we say, persuade the miners to include this transaction and invalidating the original transaction.
Other people are saying that it takes a fairly large effort to pull off a double spend but I don't think this is the case if the original transaction is still unconfirmed. I could be wrong.

I guess that's true, so does that make it fiat then? Or something in between?  Once a coin is produced it is then effectively worthless? Sort of like a carpenter taking his time, energy and resources to produce a cabinet. Sure he's invested in it, but he now relies on someone willing to exchange with him something of at least equal value (to him). Maybe I'm missing something, difference between miners and consumers perhaps? I think at the end of the day everything, gold, silver, bitcoins, only have implied value.
This was submitted more because I thought people interested in bitcoin may find this interesting.

Can I ask how long after listing did it take to sell, was it all in one go? And if possible roughly how much was for sale?

Bitcoin addresses don't hold any amount. It is effectively calculated. To send any amount of bitcoins to another address, in your transaction you have to reference previous transactions that were sent to you that contain at least the amount you are trying to send on.
The best video I've seen so far which explains it better than I can:

Sure, it's around 3m50 -5m00 (
Essentially, from what I understand, If I want to send you 5 BTC, I have to say I'm sending you 5 BTC AND reference transactions going into my account that add up to at least 5 BTC. So if I have received 3 BTC in one transaction and 4 BTC in another, I can reference both of those transactions. However I'm only sending you 5 BTC and not 3+4 BTC (transactions must be used wholly). So what happens is the transaction will contain two outputs, 5 BTC to you and 2 BTC to my own address. These transactions (my previous input transactions) are then marked as spent and cannot be used as inputs to any other transactions. This is why "you send the entire $20" essentially.
Hope that helps.
