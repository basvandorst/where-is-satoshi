Bulltrap was coined on the stock market in NYC. Im guessing
The Bull on wallstreet, stock floor known as Bullpen. Bulltrap, is what it would be called on a stock market.
So lets be different &amp; call it a Beartrap. Cause bitcoin is like a hybernation game &amp; you gotta sleep on the coins. till when the best time to wakeup &amp; sell.

Sense i started Mining bitcoin.
I get such a boner for these price jumps.
Even tho i want it to crash, so i can buy more coins.
But i read predictions of 3000$

 coinbase has a eth wallet but they'd still do not have an LTC wallets. 
A lazy Miner who uses nicehash so it's recently I've been minding a lot of Litecoin but they convert over to bitcoin and deposit in my coinbase for me like that.
But really like to actually hold on to the Litecoin.
I just can't find a reliable wallet but I haven't looked at maybe a month or two any recommendations

As a fan of Overwatch i say.
LIES! LIES! LIES! 
They say its gonna explode up to 4000$ 
I personally would love to keep this Rollercoaster going. I want it to crash down again. Only to rebuild and go UP!

What types of wallets do they support.
I'll be very inclined to switch over if they support LTC coinbase does not.

Like really, what  would they even do with them. They are hackers, not extream sport athletes. 
It's like this one from Marvel 
Why would you give scientists &amp; mathematicians a internship in a creative environment that has nothing to do with their goals. Maybe if they are programmers sense you use code in VFX sometimes. 
But honestly, give them a internship they can use on their resume instead of, coffee girl intern @ marvel. Lol

My miners are making me some $$$ latly. 
Tough to call if i want to push more profits to more miners or just keep rolling.
Any thought? 
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:54:48
