This Nobel prizewinning bloke thought the Internet was a sham, this is more tech than economics.

Could be the downfall of Bitcoin and the rise of other currencies, Dogecoin ftw?!

Almost 6 months ago a Financial Director for JP Morgan came on this subreddit for help to buy a stupidly large amount of Bitcoins with his company's money, I sorta knew they were going to try and compete somehow.

I don't understand you? Would you not be happy to have at least 25% of your life changing sum back? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:32:53
I'm sure they'll find more, but still, if Bitcoin quadruples in value, you'll still have the original value back before it was lost. And if you're not greedy, that would be your life changing amount, am I correct?
It was simply a mistake storing in mtgox, unless you were shorting.

I really like the look of Electrum, going to do a bit of research into it! Many thanks for the suggestions!
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:52:31
Thanks, I'll have a look at mycelium, but Electrum looks quite good to me too.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:03:27
Thanks again to any who respond!

Yes, I can read man........

How does that even matter? The average US teenager doesn't know maths on a scale even close to that.

Ulbricht got fucked over pretty hard then.

I got specifically asked questions by a guy who worked very high up in Morgan who wanted to purchase huge amounts of BTC, it could definitely be them.
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:21:48
So currently we have 14 Million coins on the market, 1 Million of which are apparently Satoshi, 0.65 Million of which is lost by gox, and then Bitstamp lost BTC and others from wallets towards the beginning of 2009. So are we realistically looking at only 12 Million or less usable BTC right now?
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:46:23
Sounds smart, there were no 7950s where I lived so managed to scrape funds to get a 280x, faster for gaming too and same hash rate. I still get a decent return, about 0.4 litecoin a day :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:08:29
I mean, with 70K USD or whatever much you said, that's about 100 BTC at current prices, few places offer that all in one go. So you might just have to buy 1-5 BTC at once several times.

Well, I've had friends who've invested significant amounts into it. Basically, I know little to nothing about them directly, but to start with I think you fill in a form on their page and they get back to you. They're only looking at people with potential to make significant holdings. 
Time seems to be the essence for you, so pop them an email and they'll get back to you ASAP.
Also, consider BTC-E, they offer lower than normal market prices because they're based in Bulgaria. You could probably snap up a few 10+ BTC sell orders because of the current dip in prices

No problem, if you are who I think you are, good luck trading ;)

 - much better site to use than just one, covers multiple. The market is so volatile in exchanges like mtgox I recommend just using this which covers all. 
I'm trying to find a site with good real time data over Litecoin, Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Just got three separate across each screen, such a pain. And the gap between Litecoin and Bitcoin is closing recently, gone from 33:1 to about 28:1 in only a few days. If you're interested in litecoins I suggest splitting at least 70:30 that 70k.

Bittylicious.co.uk is where you can get coins in the UK, it'll be a small amount at a time but it's very quick, as is bitbargain.co.uk

For large bitcoin investments, firms such as the Bitcoin Investment Trust might be of interest to you? Sorry, it's just that most people don't invest all at once, they just steadily add BTC whenever they can.
