The whitepaper also doesn't say 1MB or 2MB block cap, nor segwit. So, while people can disagree on things, and while it's very possible the whitepaper doesn't lay out the most optimal implementation of a UTXO blockchain, you shouldn't throw cherrypicks from the whitepaper in someone's face.

So an 85-year old woman blindly followed instructions on TheThingSheWants.com.
And it turns out that the community is in debate about whether the version of TheThingSheWants with Segwit is the real TheThingSheWants, or if the version of TheThingSheWants with larger block and restored op codes is the real TheThingSheWants. It just so happens that TheThingSheWants.com is owned by the person who thinks TheThingSheWants with larger block and restored op codes is the real TheThingSheWants. And that person also has an app where the default TheThingSheWants is the TheThingSheWants with larger block and restored op codes.
So, this 85-year old woman follows the instructions blindly, because she's 85 years old, and we don't expect anyone that old to do any research beyond going to TheTheThingIWant.com.
So here we are, and her nephew is blaming everyone (and threatening violence) because god forbid someone out there who owns a website has a fucking opinion.
But sure, fuck the coin that's not my coin.

There is an objective difference between banning something because it steals your private keys or passwords, vs banning something because there is a difference of opinion of which chain is the "true Bitcoin", especially in absence of any trademark ownership.
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:44:36
1) All banning is censoring. Full stop. Banning child porm is also censoring. I and 99.9% of the world would agree that it's a very very welcome form of censoring, but it is still censoring.
2) Confusing, yes. Misleading, no. It is a matter of opinion that the Bitcoin chain with segwit is more worthy of "Bitcoin" proper, than the Bitcoin chain with larger blocks and restored op codes. Opinion because is the metric market cap, nodes, miners, closeness to whitepaper, lines of code, features, need for side chain, philosophy, developer count, implementation code bases, etc? The more you refuse to believe that, and try to force your ideology onto others, the more disagreements will look like misleadings to you.
@_date: 2018-09-13 19:34:19


I didn't ask you about another one. I asked between the Bitcoin Cash and Core, which is closer to original. They both have the original bug fixes. And the very nature of your question is why Roger or anyone thinking Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, is a valid argument, even if its not sufficient to sway you to concede.


It would be a metric. And you can place weight on that metric as you see fit.


It looks like you're understanding now. There are many metrics, and every person is able to weight them as they see fit. You cannot force anyone to weight closeness to genesis rules more than chain weight. You also shouldn't throw your arms up in disbelief if someone weighs one of the valid metrics more than you think it should be weighted, as if your weighting is all that matters.
To answer your string of question succinctly, if someone creates a chain and calls it anything, it is up to everyone to choose to follow with it if they feels he makes a good point, or not to. And that person would have an uphill battle to convince enough people and exchanges and merchants to call his chain by that name. He won't succeed if he doesn't have valid arguments.
If someone create a new Bitcoin, straight from the whitepaper, and it doesn't share and of the historical chain, they can call it Bitcoin, and no one will believe them. But if it follows the rules, its some kind of Bitcoin.

Except it's the literal definition of it. Humans should rely on trusted social circles to maneuver in life. Like picking a wallet. All the wallets can be listed without censorship, and you can pick the one you either know will do what you want, or someone you trust told you it will do what you want.
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:25:54
My logic stated that if you wanted to live in a censorship-free environment, then rely on your trust circle. Any form of ban is literally censorship. Even if it's altruistic censorship, or censorship in the name of ethics or morality; it's still censorship.
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:03:26


That's exactly what I am saying. Censoring others because they believe their fork is the real Bitcoin is not the solution. Being more helpful and more involved to help people understand the choices they are making is important. Also, we can't always help those who are so quick to make a decision because they just want to buy the latest craze.
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:12:16
I fail to see how it is required to have Bitcoin Core as default. Its a Bitcoin wallet. "Bitcoin with larger blocks, no segwit, and restored op codes" and "Bitcoin with segwit" are both supported by the wallet. The creator of the wallet believes "Bitcoin with larger blocks, no segwit, and restored op codes" should be the default. Its not unethical in the slightest.
This is the result of public outcry, flagging, reporting, whatnot (and I'm not saying its invalid, but it definitely is subjective) resulting in Google banning. Something like "this app stile my passwords" would be an objective report.
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:15:12
Exactly, its censorship, and we make choices to accept degrees of censorship and requirements of trust in our life. So long as we understand that in this case its an app that you subjectively argue is malicious. Tomorrow, it can be a category of apps Google thinks are subjectively malicious (all crypto apps). This mentality is "I'm ok with it so long as it doesn't touch the things I like".
@_date: 2018-09-13 06:44:26
Longest/heaviest chain is irrelevant. If Bitcoin forks into working like Monero, and maintains longest/heaviest chain, what is it? Bitcoin? Monero?
You have some people that think the longest/heaviest sharing the Bitcoin genesis block is Bitcoin. You have others who think the chain behaving most like the original whitepaper/implementation, sharing the Bitcoin genesis block, is Bitcoin. Time will tell which one will become the most used, if either. That's not going to happen this year, and it probably won't happen next year. So right now, it's very hard to make a case for why Roger is in the wrong holding onto Bitcoin, or why anyone else is in the wrong for holding onto whatever they have of either chain. There are domains, repos, partnerships, handles, tickers, etc.
And I'd also like to dismantle this tactic of calling BCH a fork, as if to diminish it because BTC "isn't a fork". They are both forks. One's a hard fork, and the other's a soft. And soft forks are coercive and still change the rules. They can result is loss of features and less usefulness for many.
Here 2 examples.
1) New dominant client version doesn't allow transactions under 1000BTC on a block. Soft fork. 99% of users cut out.
2) New dominant client version only allows UTXOs from a whitelist. Soft fork. Huge amount of users cut out.
The sad part is, once you soft fork a feature away or tighten the rules, you now need a hard fork to set them back. When Satoshi soft forked a 1MB block size in to deal with spam, even if only 6 months later, it would have taken a hard fork to undo. But the result of the undo would have been exactly how it was before. So, does a hard fork really always bring you further from Bitcoin?

Investing in cryptocurrency is a huge risk, and if someone can't handle understanding what they are buying, we shouldn't bend over backwards to make it _seem_ less risky. This whole idea that we have to shift away from decentralised consensus and "cleanse" our ecosystem of "brand names" and "tradmarks" to Betty and Joe, who have dollar signs in their eyes, can buy the Bitcoin that the majority of people are talking about around the water cooler, is so backwards its laughable.


Nothing is wrong, but they need to assume the risk. All of it. Not a cherrypicked, cleansed, coddled version of it.


I never said that. I said they need to prepare to assume the risk because if all we do is cater to those with dollar signs in their eyes, the tech won't get better, and there will be so much more volatility. So many more uneducated hands that will make the dips turn into bloodbaths. So many more uneducated sheep that wlll cause chasing crypto profits and higher highs result in knee-jerk government reactions. We don't need average Joe in the space yet. It's not ready. And if Joe wants in when its not ready, that's his risk. Or he waits.


I don't know what you mean by moon-proof. If you cater to average joe looking for profits, you're going to see continued bubbles that don't do any good to anyone besides volatility traders.
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:12:19
You're not getting it. Regular people shouldn't be _investing_ in crypto because it will remain a risk until clear winners and use cases are fleshed out, large forks stop happening, volatility decreases, etc. In the present state, that fact that there is a risk means there is a potential for reward, and vice versa.
Is a witch-hunt for the apps who think bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin really anywhere in the top of priorities for this tech and community? Is now the time to pick and label "winners" so Joe and Betty have a clear indication where to put the money under their mattress?

Which chain behaves more like the original chain at genesis? The one with segwit and a block cap, or the one without either? That's objectively measurable. I'd like your answer.
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:10:44
Sounds like a difference of opinion, which is welcome in decentralized tech. It's not trivial for humans to determine the chain they are dealing with, since the chain is a combination of genesis block, transactions, and transient consensus rules. Humans must rely on their trusted social circles for many things. Picking a wallet is one of those things.
@_date: 2018-09-13 03:11:19
Of course. This is why humans rely on reputation. I trust certain wallet developers and communities for certain things. I trust Roger, that in his wallet, Bitcoin Cash is actually Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core is what the majority call Bitcoin. If I bought Bitcoin Core and it bought Bitcoin Cash, then that's actually misleading, and a very different thing.
Your hypotheticals are apples to oranges.


That's not the same as having a one-time default.
Basically, there is a difference between being misunderstanding and being misled. And part of the risk in this space (and people assume this risk in order for potential profits) is that its decentralised and changing so fast with so much nuance, which means you shouldn't be getting a Bitcoin wallet and buying Bitcoin unless you understand the difference between the forks. Sorry, you just don't get to come into a high-risk/high-reward space and demand a pathway because you don't understand or didn't take the time to understand or be led by someone you trust who understands.
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:49:03


Segwit2x was abandoned by Core, and pretty publicly. The writing was on the wall. And Core had a long history of blocking 2x for years, so it's not accurate at all to say Ver and company were not patient. They were incredibly patient given the how trivial 2MB should have been, since the original code didn't have a 1MB cap to begin with.
Also, I could frame that differently: "Unfortunately, since Maxwell, Luke, and company weren’t patient enough, and absolutely refused to wait for BTC to implement segwit after a blocksize increase"
Segwit is and was a more complicated code change than 2MB blocks. It can be argued 2MB blocks was made harder to implement in Core than necessary due to purposeful code architecture, but that's beside the point. Core chose to hold back a simpler scaling mechanism for years in order to implement a more complex one-time scaling bump.


This assumes Lightning maintains decentralisation levels and doesn't result in Superhub/Watchtower hell.


Agreed. That's fair nomenclature given the circumstances.

Which is why its risky to deal with things that offer very small or sparse trust circles. Risky things are risky. Hard problems are hard. But let's acknowledge that instead of pretending like banning isn't an actual form of censorship.

Except that's not how it is in the app. The default is and says Bitcoin Cash. And you can enable Bitcoin Core in the settings. There is no coin that is just Bitcoin in that app. Let's stop talking hypotheticals and stick with how things are.
@_date: 2018-09-13 03:55:37
Nope. In the wallet there is Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core. While they are both Bitcoin, neither is labeled as just Bitcoin. It is a difference of opinion whether Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Core is the true Bitcoin. What many more can agree on is that Bitcoin Cash is the ticker BCH and Bitcoin Core is the ticker BTC.

You realize there was no block size limit before the 1MB cap was forked in, right? The protocol has changed. We're now debating protocol becoming more strict vs protocol becoming less strict. Both are deviating, and each side is calling the other an imposter. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:04:24
It's still a protocol change.
Take this scenario. Everyone knows and agrees to the minimum driving age of 18 years old. Everyone can spot underage drivers. We "soft fork" and up the age to 30 years old. Those who don't updated their rule book are still "compatible", since everyone driving now is still over 18, so soft fork achieved. Except you've just screwed everyone 18-30 years old. And when these people start letting their kids at 18 drive, or themselves if they are younger than 30, they are prevented.
But I bet you'd think they're saying "Well at least they didn't lower the age to 16, because that would have been catastrophic!" As if that's any sort of rebuttal.
A fork is a fork. Label it as you want so you sleep better at night, but it's still a change in protocol.

Agreed. Such a blanket blacklisting would be incredibly shortsighted and unjustly restrictive. If everything mixed, they can't reasonably blacklist it all. But people aren't reasonable...
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:53:16
Are you implying that no consensus mechanism exists for relaxing protocol rules? Are there good hard forks? If a hard fork is proposed that is so accepted that every node and miner adopts it, is that not consensus? If so, what about 90%?
Also, this label of compatibility is inadequate. In soft forks, outdated nodes remain compatible for validating transactions and blocks, but not for creating certain transactions or blocks.

I am not sure if you're trolling or not... The fact that Core and BU nodes exist and are in more numbers than a fork with just a modified inflation, is exactly why its vote by hash power. If the nodes running a higher inflation code outnumbered the rest by hashpower, then it would be the majority chain.
The utility of the network is directly dependant on it's security. The more miners securing it with hashpower, the more users would use it. The per-unit value of a coin in USD is irrelevant for adoption and use, given divisibility.
Think about it this way, as a new adopter, which would you choose:
- A coin with 21 million cap, with 16 million current supply, and 3.5 TH/s, where each coin is currently worth $1000 USD
- A coin with 42 million cap, with 16 million current supply, and 7 TH/s, where each coin is currently worth $500 USD
User and nodes follow utility, security, and therefore hashrate.

For the minority of nodes and miners that believe in a particular law, they kept their chain where what happened always happened. For the majority that didn't believe in that particular law, they voted to repeal the law retroactively and move forward. If you don't like that, you are free to continue to use the only set of laws in the other chain.

I can't be bothered to reply to your entire comment, because there is just way too much to unpack. So I'll just say this:
First, I'm just commenting about the context, assuming no one is speculating. If people above me are speculating (i.e it's just speculation that he asked for permission and went), then my point still stands in that context. If there's more to the story in both sides, and obviously there is, then my point is out of context, isn't it?
All we know is what he was arrested for according to the people that arrested him. It's up to them to prove he broke the law, just or not.
Second, I regret saying "make that law just". What I meant was "just because the cop says it's against the law, doesn't mean that eating ice cream is actually against the law". People who enforce laws have a tendency to not actually understand the law, either because of stupidity or alternate motives.

I agree. That's why I said Lightning is more decentralized than banks, for sure, but less decentralized than the main chain. Also, keep in mind, centralization doesn't only come in the form of controlling money. It can be in the form of censorship, tiered-fee discrimination, and super hubs charging higher fees because "where else are you going to go? The main chain? Hahahaha"
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:40:47
Because that's exactly how Nostro/Vostro banking works. If you want to wire money to someone in Poland, from Mexico, its routed through a Mexican bank, through that Mexican bank's bank in NYC, through the Polish bank's bank somewhere, and then through the Polish bank. The Mexican bank does not wire or communicate directly to the Polish bank. It relies on these paths through "super banks" (Nostro/Vostro banks) that act as hubs. And each bank takes a fee along the way. This is almost exactly like Lightning, except Lightning is more decentralised because anyone with enough capital can become a hub and open many channels, but not as decentralised as the main chain since being a larger hub requires more capital.
If you have a ton of Bitcoin, you can become a super hub that almost everyone is connected to, since everyone else is connected to you. Why would anyone connect to another smaller hub if that will incur more hops, when everyone they want to send money to is directly connected to you. If I have enough capital to open enough channels to support EVERY bitcoin user, then we only really need one Lightening hub.
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:51:54
To be fair, those 4000 merchants did not open Lightening channels with a hub, they are just using the middleman (centralised) Coingate platform to get fiat based on the Lightning payments Coingate detects. I wouldn't call it a win if Coingate is just increasing the merchants fiat balance based on Lightning payments.

@_date: 2018-06-27 13:28:35
I said a large lightning hub is like a bank.
You are arguing technical and irrelevant semantics.
If the main chain is just the settlement system and most people need to use lighting to make transactions with reasonably low fees to achieve quick transactions, then you are forcing them to connect to a hub that can easily route their transactions to other parties that are connected to them or to other hubs.
If the hub you're connected is the same as the one the person you want to pay is connected to, then there is less routing and lower fees. If the person you want to pay is not connected to the hub you're connected to, then there are additional routing hops, and an increase in fees. This is parallel to how banks work. Moving money from one account to another within a bank is pretty much free. Moving money from one bank to another within a country is cheap. Moving money from one bank to another in a different country is more expensive.
Let's address your points one by one, semantics aside. And remember, I'm not talking about lightning nodes, I'm talking about lightning hubs.
- holds your money. Well, you do have to open s channel with them and deposit/lock-in some BTC until that channel is closed.
- requires full kyc. Yes, you are correct, hubs don't require this. However, given that they are required to also deposit/lock-in some BTC in the channel, they have the ability to choose with whom they do that. So, if they wanted to screen people before opening a channel, they very well could. But they don't. Not yet. Maybe never. Let's hope. But they do have the power to do that.
- is able to censor your transactions. They absolutely can. A hub can flat out refuse to route anything to a list of other hubs. At the end of the day, if you can reach your destination with the hub you're connected to, you'll need to find a new hub. But it would be naive to assume they aren't able to censor your transactions.
- doesn't allow sub-cent transactions. This is silly. The only units on the blockchain that matter are Satoshis. The blockchain handles integers, not floats. So you're seeing is like me saying, hubs didn't allow sub-satoshi transactions. Your argument is a criticism of first flat currencies, not of banks. Further, many equity exchanges do track transactions to sub-cent precision. Irrelevant none the less.
- takes time, days, to process transaction. Your correct. This is  the fault of kyc and old systems. However, hubs being better at doing things than actual fiat banks, isn't an argument for why hubs don't act like banks. That's like saying my dog isn't really a dog because it runs 4 times faster than the average dog.
- has fees. Routing on lighting absolutely has fees. Or else why would any hub choose to open and lock up so much BTC in channels? Running a lighting hub is intended to be profitable, just like running a mining rig. Eventually, when a hub is running low on capital to open new channels, do you think it's that far-fetched to believe they might start closing "stale channels" or requesting others to keep their channel alive with a monthly fee?
- fractional reserve banking. This is a type of banking. Hubs nothing being able to do fractional reserve banking isn't an argument for them not being banks. Just like my dog not being able to do tricks doesn't make him not a dog.

I didn't say, nor do I believe Deloitte is anti-bitcoin, just that this is literally probably their only bitcoin-related project.
Deloitte is subject to a lot less financial, regulatory, and brand loyalty risk with their BTM than a bank would, so a pet project like this, I don't think involved nearly as much as you might think. If the BTM is only usable by employees, then even less.
I am in the financial district, and I don't think any of my counterparts would see this as anything more, or as any indicator that Deloitte has some amazing blockchain know-how. That being said, I am sure many of my non-technical counterparts would be eating this up to varying degrees, lol.
@_date: 2016-09-07 15:16:17
This is a marketing stunt and hubris. Deloitte isn't doing anything significant with Bitcoin (unless you call partnering to host a BTM as significant). Rubrix is building dApps on Ethereum (smart contract) last I checked. All big firms (banks and professional services) are more concerned with smart contracts, distributed ledgers, and tokens (digitizing assets), rather than cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin).
Source: I'm a technical professional at a very large Toronto institution working full-time on blockchain initiatives. I also deal with most of my blockchain professional counterparts frequently, including Deloitte.
EDIT: For what it's worth, I personally like and own Bitcoin, so I am not against it. Just telling it like it is. Don't get false hope.

Not diminishing what you've done, but apart from the content this device happens to display, this has very little to do with Bitcoin. The fact that this is so highly upvoted in this sub is quite sad.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:35:08
I genuinely want to get a different point of view on this. To me, this sounds like, "if you're directly connected to your friend, you can give him money without fees, but if you have to hop through banks to route, then there are routing fees". Aren't these routing nodes just going to end up being richer hubs, just like banks? I see lightning as a positive step towards many accumulated micropayments, like say you wanted to pay per KB of data consumed of a coffee shop's WiFi, but just parking/funding your Bitcoin in channels with nodes that are well connected, sounds very much like funding your bank account. I do see though that, at the very least, unlike a bank account, you can theoretically walk away or withdraw much more freely or quickly with lightning, I'd assume. Do I have the gist of it, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:51:53
The network users and miners chose to run software (there are at least 4 node client implementations) that disagreed with something. That's literally how blockchains work. Done if those clients even still gave users options at runtime to pick their chain.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:55:17
Regarding lightning, that's exactly what he said! You can't *spend* ~10000 sats because that's what it costs to open a channel. The person who wants to pay (not the receiver) needs to fund the channel, and thus can't spend less than ~10000 sats. So it looks like he does understand a few things about lightning, and you misread what he wrote.

Gavin prefaced the panel during his introduction by saying that he wasn't hacked and that he does believe Craig, and that he would answer questions during the Q&amp;A afterwards. The panel included Vitalik, who sat to his right.
During the Q&amp;A, no one asked Gavin any questions, so Gavin decided to talk about the Craig/Satoshi news himself. He gave his 1-minute reasoning why he is convinced that Craig is Satoshi, because he signed a text that he (Gavin) chose, and verified it himself.
It seemed like the crowd was going to accept that, and the session was going to end, but then Vitalik just started taking, and said he'd give his reasoning on why he thinks Craig isn't Satoshi.
He said, Craig has 2 ways to prove himself. The first, and easiest/simplest, being to just sign a unique message and post it publicly so everyone can verify it. The second would be to post some long blog post (that was arguably more complicated to understand than actually verifying some signed text) and only ask a select few to choose a message, show the signature to, and ask to verify. Vitalik then says that this fails basic signaling theory, and thus Craig is not Satoshi. Gavin twerked his head and nodded as if to say, "I see you point. Meh."
The panel session ended right there. The crowd laughed. I laughed. Vitalik laughed. There moderator laughed. The crowd laughed some more. Gavin seemed uncomfortable.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:51:32
I'm actually sitting 10 feet from Gavin now, while he's in a panel at a conference. Tell me the question, I'll ask it in the Q&amp;A. I'm serious. But need to know soon, panel won't last all day.

Nice cop-out ;)
Let me put it this way, I just want your principles/beliefs on the record. If a minority chain remains after Segwit or UASF, would you make the same criticism of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:53:43
Again, we were using Bitcoin without the current 1MB max in production before Segwit was even conceptualized.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:01:43
It's easy to make silly, unsubstantiated arguments, without any actual reasoning. Watch!
Even if Segwit was "tested", does not mean it is not extremely dangerous. Last thing we need is giving corporations like Blocksteam and Co even more power.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:39:13
You clearly do not have a grasp of the concepts your are talking about. The minority chain does not just "shrivel and die" because it has significantly less haspower than a majority chain. The only way the minority chain could "shrivel and die" is if 1.1% of the majority chain attacks the minority chain. This becomes increasingly difficult as the minority chain gains honest hashpower. In any case, the same design Bitcoin has, exists in Ether.  Your inability (or refusal) to see that is worrisome.
In the case of the ETC/ETH split, ETC had 10% of the hashpower at fork-time. It could have "shriveled and died", except no honest significant hashpower on the ETH chain found it rewarding to attack ETC.
Again, your cherrypicking of my arguments, instead of responding to all the points I've made, is indicative of your understanding and confidence in the topics at hand.

Once again, you have provided no evidence or reasoning, just empty statements.
Here, look, I'll reuse all of your lines as structure for empty arguments for larger blocks.


The ONLY ones holding larger blocks back are the shady developer concerns under Greg Maxwell's thumb


He and his Blockstream goons are directly responsible for holding back Bitcoin progress, for their own selfish greed.


There IS, indeed consensus for larger blocks, outside a few bad actors that have centralized far too much client developer power.


The last thing we need is to give these hijackers even MORE power, which is what SegWit would do.


Larger blocks will be activated, THEN we can talk about further SAFE off-chain scaling solutions, without the insane risk.
You see, without reasoning and evidence to back up your statements, they are empty, and anyone can make statements about anything, as I just did.
You need to learn how to form proper arguments, it will help you in your life and in your career, apart form just in crypto or on reddit.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:26:50
First, you brought up immutability, for really no reason, since you seem to agree its irrelevant to the conversation we were having.
Second, any mining pool could fork off Bitcoin right now, with even 1% of hashpower, into a minority chain called "Bitcoin2", and any exchange could decide to offer coins on that chain to their customers. Nobody can stop this from happening, so how would this be Bitcoin's or the developers' fault or failure?
You cannot prevent forks, you can only try to make sure your fork is more valuable. A minority forking off is not a sign of a bad main chain, nor is a minority not forking wth the majority. You cannot be blamed for others' decisions.

@_date: 2017-06-14 21:26:30
Now you are waivering on your point. You said "if you call a chain split surviving". A chain split has nothing to do with a "roll back", as you call it.
-You can chain split without a roll-back (i.e. without affecting "immutability"), such as what can happen in Bitcoin's upcoming UASF.
-You can sacrifice immutability without having a chain split, such as in the early days, when Satoshi fixed the bug that someone took advantage of to create huge amounts of coins "out of thin air", which caused a hard-fork with no minority chain. (Bitcoin isn't immutable either then)
You are conflating issues since you are not able to argue either of them effectively, or with confidence.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:30:05
I think you mean "could".
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:57:42
I don't need to write one. An alternative and safe method was not only written, but it was in production, too! It's the version we had before the 1MB limit was put in place. Amazing right? Awesome, so you'll accept it right, since a no limit impending was tested and in production before?
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:20:35
Yes, they require more bandwidth, but can you show how the larger bandwidth needed by 2MB or 4MB blocks would significant, and further, more significant downside than the upside of added transaction throughput?
Also, is hard to take someone seriously when they just claim "Jihan and other that don't agree with me are scam artists". Who are "and Co" and what did they do to specifically meet the definition of a scam artist?

If all the experts and community agreed, we would have SegWit by now. The fact that there isn't consensus about this amongst the experts and community is why Bitcoin is in the scaling state it's in now.
Again, Bitcoin was operating without a block-size limit before. 1MB is an arbitrary choice.
Also, your ad hominem attacks do not help your argument. You haven't made a single technical argument in your post. Try to explain why doubling or tripling the current block-size is dangerous.

I would consider it the results of an ideal democracy. "If you don't like our rules, you are free to live in your own world with your own rules, as you were, or as you wish".
I agree that a chain split is both undesirable and a failure to achieve consensus (which is a redundant statement), but can you explain why you consider a chain split not surviving? Ethereum did in fact survive the DOA catastrophe, and still allowed any of those unwilling to revert to carry on with like-belief users/miners.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:24:40
If Bitcoin adopts SegWit, and 10% of the miners refuse and mine the old chain, Bitcoin will split. The Segwit chain will be the real Bitcoin, as it is the longest and with most hashpower, but the old will still exist. Its the same thing, but when "the other guy does it" you criticize. Take your blinders off.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:43:27

Or, just lift the temporary 1MB limit on blocks, to 2MB, or 4MB? Hmm, I wonder which is simpler?
