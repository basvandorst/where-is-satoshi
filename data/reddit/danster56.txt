Lol risky play
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:20:15
Yeah genuinely, heard similar from people who have been to the TT in the past
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:34:16

@_date: 2018-03-25 20:11:14

@_date: 2018-03-28 22:43:20
Loads of the people who watch this, and are interested in stocks and investing. Can now buy it easily through robin hood.
I imagine robinhood allowing crypto should give us a boost making it easier for normal people to buy

@_date: 2018-02-19 19:57:01
try I have seen people there asking for advice on crypto
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:27:48
Not everyone filled claims in time, or with enough evidence. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:50:39
Easier. One new thing is robinhood (which made buying stocks easy for normal people). 
Now allow crypto purchases through the same app.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:58:08
implying he is smart after selling big orders of BTC at market price on exchanges
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:13:04
Nothing, it cant increase paat that level intentionally
@_date: 2018-07-21 11:50:36
More coins lost out the supply the better tbh!
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:07:47
HAHA its me!
@_date: 2018-07-21 11:53:28
Whoever owns the machine sets the fees... And clearly he wants to overcharge.
It's quite likely the only reason those BTC atms even exist, is people money laundering dirty money
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:45:56
omg, i know this off by heart still after watching IT crowd YEARS ago. i can quote it in full whenever, weird
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:37:53
This has me thinking, there should be a way to sell and buy used cars and motorcyles for BTC
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:20:24

@_date: 2018-04-01 00:20:29

@_date: 2018-04-21 23:22:06
Don't be silly. you realise the US isnt the whole entire world right?
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:02:42
Same question, how can you earn Fiat quickly? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:21:41
Hope you aren't referencing the scam that is BCH. Mother of all shitcoins and completely worthless
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:22:43

@_date: 2018-04-20 17:45:06
I did the same today!! at a local Liberal cafe. Tower Cafe in Newcastle.
Their first even BTC payment and i helped set up and show how it all worked
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:53:47
You think i would ever own any bitcoin Cash? id rather hold doge coin
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:17:34
I went to my local "hipster" cafe who just started accepting BTC and got ice cream and a coffee (his first ever Bitcoin and first ever bitcoin sale) he was beyond ecstatic!! 
Went back the following day (his bitcoin went up 20p!) to help him out implement it better and got a pizza paid and paid with BTC. (Tower cafe!)
We are now planning on organising a weekly bitcoin meetup, for newcastle bitcoin enthusiasts and small businesses wanting to learn about BTC and accept it
i Plan to help out small businesses set up bitcoin as a payment for free in my local area  
CEX a major video game store type place, bit like gamestop in the US? has also accepted bitcoin for ages in the UK too,
Check out Coinmap for those close, alot arnt even listed you gotta find em
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:45:22
rather have it in the hands of tech guys and people who early invested in tech they believed will change the world.
Than the current 1% and banking elite 
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:37:25
I dont leave my funds in exchanges, other than my trading stack( coinbase). The rest is is a secure wallet
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:56:38

@_date: 2018-04-13 20:35:21
Schnorr signatures, signature aggregation, MAST, sidechains and drivechains, Taproot, and Graftroot.
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:13:21
Unlikely for along time, but one can dream
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:24:43
BTC and XMR are my main % stacks.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:09:15
Lighten up man, have abit of fun.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:45:58
Bitpay is the ideal platform to get small businesses involved. super easy for them and even has the option for them to instantly convert the BTC to fiat if they dont want to be exposed to BTC volitility
Thats what ive been and am continuing to do in my home city
Edit: maybe not bitpay is the best, thanks for the advice i want to spread adoption for ftee
