Hi sproutkraut, I think the easiest way would be for me to set it up for you, but I could also open source it as well. Send me a PM or contact me through

If tierrabuena receives bitcoin directly from their customers and can decide to pay for goods and services, or sell them in localbitcoins (or cryptocambios), then there's no middleman. If cryptocambios does not charge an 'exchange' fee when buying bitcoin from tierrabuena, and instead decides to keep those bitcoins and sell them for more later, then tierrabuena is not paying any fees. Need a drawing?

What? seriously? Tierrabuena does not pay any processing fees (other than bitcoin network fees for example), and even then, it's much less than the 6.5% that credit cards would take. And they have the bitcoin in their wallet as soon as it confirms. Bitcoin *is* a currency, they get it directly. Deal with it.

Some of them do tech or graphic design consulting overseas and get paid in bitcoins (or at least they get their money into the country that way), there's also people who accept bitcoin themselves. A restaurant called   comes to mind, they use tierrabuena vegetables for some of their dishes.

Cooking and freezing is probably the preferred and tastiest way, but since these vegetables are harvested less than 24 hours before delivery, you can get a good 7 days if stored properly, it does vary from vegetable to vegetable, pumpkins can go on for weeks outside the fridge, but greens may go bad after 4/5 days. If you have enough space in your house, you may want to give some of these [room-temperature storage methods]( a try. I'm one of the guys behind Tierra Buena, I'm glad you liked your basket :)

Tierrabuena has a special deal with cryptocambios.com where they can offload bitcoin to argentine pesos using the btc/usd rate from btc-e and the 'blue dollar' rate for usd/ars. (there are at least 2 exchange rates for usd/ars, it's a long story). Cryptocambios (which I also run) takes all the risk, but that's ok, hoarding bitcoin has been a safe bet so far.
edit: They say there is no middleman because they receive the bitcoin to their own addresses directly from the customer. Selling it (or keeping it) is something they choose to do afterwards, so it's not a middle-men arrangement.

So essentially you're saying that anyone providing business to business services is a middleman? I guess the email company and the ISP is also a middleman then. You're obviously failing to see the context here, "no middlemen" as in: No cartelized banking/credit card institution that holds funds for 21+ days before clearing (while it looses value due to inflation, which in argentina is reaching 20% p/year), and of course no central bank. "No fees" as in: No processing fees derived from the cost of offsetting credit card fraud and/or pleasing the whims of the credit card cartel.

Geez, yes. Cryptocambios does charge a fee when selling bitcoin, but not when buying from tierra buena.
