Damn, if this is a quick summary, you must read quite a lot about Bitcoin! Well done, and thank you for organizing it for us.

Inflation is not entirely a bad thing, and I would imagine that most of the employees of the Federal Reserve don't view themselves as evil overlords, hurting the middle class. 
Another way to think about 2% inflation is a "2% yearly tax on current cash balances." And what's really elegant about it is that it doesn't matter if you're hoarding cash in a swiss bank account, or under your mattress, every USD is affected. 
Are you more mad about inflation than you are about other taxes? The people who benefit the most from inflation are those who hold large amounts of long-term debt. Because if the value of the dollar goes down, your debt balance becomes easier to pay off. As is pretty obvious, the biggest holder of long-term debt in the world is the US government. 
And who gets to benefit from the things that the US government spends money on? US citizens. If you live in the US, you should be pretty happy about this system. If you live outside the US, you should probably be pretty peeved.

Now we just blow all the shit into the atmosphere. When you think about it, the exhaust pipe on a car is kind of like the end of a digestive tract.

Thanks for writing out your thoughts... I think your reference to "no taxation without representation" is interesting and valid. 
I think we agree on the inefficiency of government. 
Though I don't understand the support here for a deflationary currency. Ideally, I would think that we would all prefer a currency that never changed in value at all. After all, a currency is not an asset. You can't live in it, and it doesn't product anything. I see no reason why it should increase or decrease in value over time in a perfect system.
