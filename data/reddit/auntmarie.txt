monetary policy is already seperated from government isn't it? The federal reserve or ECB are both actually privately owned. 
And a government without tax income... yeah maybe. But still one way or another we have to pay for community works and services.

$1 fee per transaction is not the internet of money. Maybe Bitcoin needs this for security but then it is also to become obsolete tech.
