I hadn't seen blockfi before -- anyone you know using it?
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:17:57
Pretty sure that was Mel Brooks
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:19:16
Or maybe that one guy that said everything. Michael Scott
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:00:15
in many other countries you use a . instead of , -- so what he said was "$100,000 USD"

Charlie Munger's birthday? 1924. What is between 2 and 4? 3. Half life 3. Confirmed.

A more accurate analogy would be 82 to 11 (

No, I think his point was the 'hypothetically if this stuff was available then'. All of the open source stuff has been in just the last year or two

Not trying to support this guy/project but Microsoft has open sourced .net and made it cross platform called ".Net Core" (
You can then use their new open source cross platform editor VSCode (

Because Oracle is so much better ;)
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:28:54
My intent was that Oracle is worse than Microsoft.
After having worked at both companies I think Oracle takes the cake for being the worst.

I tend to try to buy things from sites that accept Bitcoin. My local game store accepts it. I settle lunches with friends using Bitcoin.
In summary, yes.

The only bitcoin advice my wife gives anymore is 'hodl'
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:19:52
Wow, you guys are right. They really do use pictures of physical bitcoins in every news article.

I had 33 stolen and then later lost 60 on mt gox... I feel you
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:28:37
Or use it and keep buying more!

In 2015 the total military spending was roughly 600 billion and total education spending was almost 800 billion. (federal + states)
Still not ideal but not as bad as your numbers make it out to be.

Maybe create small cards with a bitcoin address that has a few satoshis  and instructions on how to use them (probably an online wallet is good to get them started: coinbase or blockchain for example). Then give out the cards to anyone who wants them!

By stage of development more like 1998

you sold that much at a loss!?

I believe the term would be a 'slippery slope argument' 
@_date: 2019-09-22 23:31:50
That's step two

 defaults to mbtc i think
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:31:53
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:15:27
mbtc makes sense because price is &gt;1000 and &lt;10000...
I think long term the best unit would be a bit (microbtc) so that the minimum unit (satoshi) would be .01 bit.
Then you can write bitcoin with a max of of 1/100th (which people are already used to with existing money)
The downside is that the current price would be 0.001863 which isn't as easy to work with.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:37:56
Is that pronounced "milibitcoin" or "milibit"
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:39:56
If a satoshi is a cent then our "dollar" or "bit" should be one microbitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:39:48
That appears to be the case

The grant exists to build jobs in Montana. Sure, they will be slightly less profitable than Chinese miners, but they are helping local people. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:51:13
Any luck?
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:47:10
Then always buy more every time you spend them!

I always try to buy 0.11 whenever i spend 0.1 ;)

I held for the most part ... I did sell at one point and rebuy to make a few coins but for the most part I am keeping everything in BTC at the end of the day. However I am on the verge of losing money if stuff keeps going down.
It will eventually come back up anyway.
@_date: 2013-07-06 22:07:44
I can't withdraw my USD because of internal server errors... Anyone seeing that other than me?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:48:15
I emailed you - I would love to contribute to an open source project. I want to make an exchange I am just finding I don't have enough time in my day to do the entire thing on my own.
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:50:48
You can have bitinstant deposit into a bitcoin wallet address. Just copy your blockchain address and paste it into bitinstant destination wallet.
EDIT: Weird, just checked bitinstant, you can't send to wallet anymore?

I am based in the US and therefore first and easiest would be USD for me. I haven't done too much research on accepting currencies from other countries. I assume I would need to open a bank somewhere in Europe to easily accept EUR.
There is always other options like OKPay and Dwolla.
As far as the development of the site -most of it would be programmed by myself and a group that I write software with - some open source software might be used as needed.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:45:53
Those have already been passed from what I understand.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:08:00
I am just mad that I did a bitinstant deposit to buy in today when the price was falling. I logged in 2 hours later to buy when the price hit 115. but my money wasn't there. Mtgox still doesn't register that my cash is there and now I can't buy :(
Bitinstant gave me an confirmation email showing they deposited the money into Mtgox... bleh
EDIT/UPDATE: Turns out Bitinstant deposit didn't magically go through like usual. If you are having the same issue and got a confirmation email from bitinstant - use the APIResponse code in gox as a redeem code to get your money.

im in at 20.1 to avoid all those buying at 20 haha

I sold ~60 coins at the top and re-bought at the bottom. I now have 75 coins.
