Yeah....  CURRENCIES!!  ....not just bitcoin.

I love how you bitcoin snobs downvote anything not bitcoin.  I'll be laughing in a year when bitcoin barely appreciates and dogecoin appreciates 50,000%.

There are other coins out there.  You could be a dogeillionaire for about $300.  I think doge has a lot of potential.

Yeah, I think not taking this too seriously (being lighthearted) is the biggest part of the appeal and why I think it's going to be adopted, why it's going to last, and why it's going to the moon.

When is Overstock going to start accepting Dogecoin?

I like the other stories.  There was a guy who said he made $10 million.  I would like to see more of those stories.

Thanks.  I'm just curious.  At what point did they begin to have value?  And how come no one came to tell me about how big this was going to be way back then?  :)

What were the original bitcoins worth dollar wise ?

Why not accept Ðogecoin?

You'll never be president now.

They're not just doing this with Bitcoin.  There are other cryptos that are experiencing lots of action in China.

Just believe the opposite of whatever this asshole says, and you'll be right.
