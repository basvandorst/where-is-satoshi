I quit smoking a pack a day and am using the equivalent savings to buy bitcoin.  One high risk activity totally wasting money in exchange for a moderately risky activity investing.

You should point that out somehow more obviously on auger.net.

This.  A temporary, but exponential growth in ATMs connected to ONE p2p exchange.  Rewards to ATM operators should be considered to aid the operation.  Eventually, the masses will adopt Bitcoin this way because of familiarity with the technology.  Meeting a stranger in person to exchange Bitcoins is not safe.  Going to an ATM is generally safe.  
EDIT:  For large amounts, it is only a matter of time before the powers that be yield on this rule, then such limits will evaporate.

He can't; unless no one can verify the block but that miner.  Some kind of register parity attack inverting the 0000s to 1111s like the old genesis chain.  Can someone replace the current blockchain with the old 111 based genesis chain and then prevent all other miners from solving the block?  MOV opcode parity flag?  8080 chipset as an example?

I've read the book and worked through the coding exercises ... well worth it and recommended reading.  Thanks for writing it.

Thanks.  I have finally decided that XT is the best thing for Bitcoin, after months of trying to figure out what was right.

The machine has barely been used so I haven't hit the problems you are mentioning.  I'm a software developer so I can alter the software and fix bugs if required.  I've been planning on changing the software to hook directly to an exchange.

The problem you have is seeing past your conception of value of physical things, into the digital realm.  By looking at the value of 1 bitcoin as transferable, you can peg the value of anything to bitcoin by burning bitcoin.  Burning the bitcoin transfers value from the bitcoin to the asset.  How?  Because you're substituting a bitcoin for another asset.  That asset becomes worth 1 btc, because you burned 1 btc.  It's like embedding 1 btc into the asset, and that is recorded on the blockchain as a transaction.  The asset takes on the value that you burned.  Pretty fucking cool, really.

In this post he talks about bloom filters.    Merkle trees are mentioned in the thread as well.
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:41:53
It depends on where you are located.  I agree that non-tech savvy users are less likely to sign up and get verified on exchanges, so the easiest way for them is through a Bitcoin ATM or LocalBitcoins.  For now that may be hard to do depending on where your users are located.

This usenet post( is from 2008, where he introduces himself in the Think Erlang group.  




running large-scale distributed systems for a decade or so and
noodling around with Erlang in my free time for almost three years
(after getting burned-out on beating my head against the wall with
Twisted/Python.)  Having had the opportunity to spend a bit more time
on Erlang recently I picked up an old project I set aside and am
currently writing a DHT storage engine for immutable data based
loosely on the Kademlia system.  Eventually I hope to throw something
like Jay Nelson's process-based caching system on top of it and see if
it can offer any advantages over the ubiquitous memcache system.
Note there is no mention of C++.

No.  Hungarian notation is a way of naming variables that hint at the datatype.  It was made popular by Charles Simonyi, apparently, who is Hungarian and so kind of named after him.

It's obviously above your capacity to understand.  Value is subjective.  We can move that subjective value around at will.  Programmable money.

I forgot about that, but they did that to me too, once I hit 1000 in deposits, I think, supposedly to avoid money laundering.

Here's how to do a hash by hand:
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:14:41
I've used Morrex and CAVirtex and both accepted interac, and you have to be verified once you hit a $1000, IIRC.  I signed up at QuadrigaCX but am still waiting for verification and it's been at least 4 days, so it is taking way longer than expected.  The interac fees are too much at CAVirtex for a DCA approach to buying, at $25.  But other than that no complaint.  Morrex just has such low volume and isn't listed on BitcoinWisdom (yet), but it was the first exchange I used and went well enough.  They verify by phone.

With two Antminer S5 ASICs I was making about 1 BTC a month but with my electricity costs, I had to just turn them off.  With a GPU you'll make pennies.

@_date: 2015-07-03 05:15:21
There's an exception to every rule, so go for it and make your business plan.  But a business plan, I'd argue, is more than just an idea.  It takes work and you really have to think things through and develop your idea beyond just the idea stage.  Don't worry so much about protecting your ideas before you expose them to others because most of the time they won't have the time, energy, or inclination to do anything about it, and those that do have the time, energy and inclination to do something about it would rather partner with, or invest in someone who will make it happen.  In other words, to get investment, you have to have a bit of faith in others to not just steal your ideas.  Don't get me wrong, I understand how you feel ... someone could just go ahead without you ... but if it is that easy to do so, and the idea is worth money, then there is probably already competitors working in secret on similar ideas.

Very interesting.  Good find.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:07:51
I'd add - to answer the third and fourth questions, that it "goes through" to the blockchain and all other nodes that are sync'd will see the transaction, so nothing is lost in cyberspace.

It's taking a long time for Quadriga to verify me as well.  Over their claims of 1-4 days.

Now acquire and spend 21 additional bitcoins.  
@_date: 2015-07-26 03:36:37
This makes total sense.  Burning bitcoins is just like buying the assets because it makes all the rest of the bitcoins more valuable.  What you sell by burning doesn't matter.  However, just because one person who burns n bitcoins thinks what is being sold is worth n bitcoins, doesn't mean anyone else will.  That's like any asset.  Just because one person thinks a house is worth $400,000, doesn't mean that anyone else does, let alone that it will go up in value, but often it does.  Makes sense to me.  
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:40:59
Ideas are a dime a dozen.  They are only worth something if you develop them into reality.  No one is going to give you money for an idea, and trying to protect an idea before it has developed into anything is a waste of energy.  You have to develop the idea into a company and risk your time and money into making it grow into something real.

His writing looks so familiar, like he was born and raised around the same time and area I was.  There is a lack of British or Aussie lingo, but a lot of Canadian in his writings.  He follows the writing styles taught in my university (and all Canadian universities, AFAIK), uses punctuation almost perfectly, and just feels like he's my age.  The word sweet was and is still commonly used by Canadians my age (40).
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:44:51
I'm missing the how part.  
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:50:42
I'm 40 and use the word 'sweet' all the time, and all his other writings (as cataloged in the Book of Satoshi) look and sound like someone straight out of my university (Dalhousie, Canada), who adopted the same writing style and lingo that I grew up with, and around my age.  But who knows?

There's nothing in the paper I've seen that would indicate the solution would probably be a local extremum.  I'd argue that ants haven't changed much because they are very well adapted, and haven't had to change.  The model is also based on neurons, which in aggregate have evolved to chat on reddit. ;)

"Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University have developed a model that explains how groups make collective decisions when no single member of the group has access to all possible information or the ability to make and communicate a final decision. Published in Science Advances, the de-centralized decision-making model shows how positive feedback during the exploration process proves useful for making good and quick decisions."

General sentiment, and I agree, seems to be, "what for?"
@_date: 2015-09-18 20:42:35
The paper describes a mathematical model for decentralized decision making, which could provide a future avenue for Bitcoin to make good and fast decisions without centralizing.  The model uses quorum, which the BitcoinXT code uses as well, but with some differences.  It may be possible to integrate the model into Bitcoin code itself, or at least be used by the community to make decisions.
