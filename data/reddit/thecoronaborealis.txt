I do miss all the hopium and the constant penis sucking of the big bull run. What else we gonna do now that we're bored and waiting?

Clearly a glitch going on here.

Honestly, this is why I foresee Bitcoin (or whatever crypto replaces it) ushering us into a new age of communal living. There is no doubt in my mind that our society is undergoing massive upheaval. There is a chance we are going to see national governments and fiat currency severely weakened in the coming decades by an economic system that is too top heavy and is already buckling under it's own weight.
During these later years we are going to see people cluster back towards local, sustainable food sources in closely-knit communities. Bitcoin is going to help people wean themselves off of a centralized currency (which will slowly become worthless and therefore undesirable) and allow communities to trade neccesities amongst themselves without the need for a middleman. 
Anyway, so happy to see farmers get in on this. They give us the food we eat and they deserve their share of the Bitcoin bounty.

On a serious note, didn't a recent audit actually confirm they do have money reserves backing up all their Tether?

SilkRoad has been shut down for ages now.

I really like Kraken. Only thing for me is that getting a bank account to wire funds there is a nightmare. I still haven't done it yet because its so complicated. So I simply transfer BTC from other exchanges.

Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

McAfee shouldn't have double-downed on his bet for $500k in the first place, imo.

I'm glad someone noticed that too. Either a glitch or someone made a serious decimal placement error in their buy order.

Artwork like this does not get enough attention on this sub. Artistic talent, especially talent supporting crypto, definitely deserves our applause.

Porque no los dos?

The emotions aren't what people care about. The real question is... can I distort the BTC price chart and super-impose it on top of this one to prove I'm right in internet arguments?

This is honestly the only chart anyone ever needs to see in Bitcoin in order to understand where it's going. The market cycles all follow the same repeating patterns. Add a zero to the price every two years and you've essentially got a price prediction.
That being said, this current bear market looks puny compared to the 2013-2017 bear market when placed side by side. I dont mind waiting, but honestly hoping we're not gonna have wait THAT long to start seeing the bulls return.

Have fun, man. I wish you the best success in your endeavor.
