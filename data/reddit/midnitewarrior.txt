Yeah I'd agree with this, however, btc is in the privileged position of being the "brand name" of all crypto. It was first to break out and has the largest market cap. If we could lay all the coins out on the table and pick one based on its merits today, I don't think Bitcoin would win. The market has picked the current winner though.

The value in crypto is the network.  The network provides a system of value storage and transfer that provides value in different ways than fiat currency or bank transfers do.
In its ideal form, crypto transfer fees are far less than VISA, banks, Western Union, or any other trusted intermediary.  Bitcoin is going through some growing pains at the moment, leading to high fees temporarily.
Security is another value provided by crypto.  A day laborer just outside of Cape Town, South Africa can walk or hitchhike into the city and work.  He can get paid to his Bitcoin wallet so he isn't jumped and robbed on the way home from work.  While he's at work, nobody can ransack his shanty and steal his money.
The unbanked and underbanked in Western countries have a way of keeping their money secure without significant fees.
On the not-always-legal side of things, the privacy aspects of crypto protect assets from forfeit and seizure, liens and garnishment.  This could be from the government, an abusive spouse, an unfair court judgement, or avoidance of a legal settlement agreement.
The privacy features that some crypto provide keeps your transactions truly private, as in, nobody can track them.  This is good for the privacy conscious or the criminal.
The security features protect you from theft - if you are savvy enough to manage your wallet yourself.
The integrity features prevent fraudulent transactions, with transactions being witnessed by multiple parties and signed.
The value features of known and limited quantities of crypto being issued means that no entity, government, corporate or other, is going to inflate away the value of your currency.
It's not that a single bitcoin has any particular value (it's just ones and zeroes), but the fact that it can participate in this secure, private network and facilitate value transfer is what brings it its value.
Is that value at $1 a btc or $20,000?  The market will decide.
edit: gold? Thanks stranger! also, typos + commas.

Yeah.  I made the mistake of showing my Dad my (meager) bitcoin holdings I accumulated from mining on my PC when he visited at Thanksgiving.
I've run NiceHash since July on my GeForce 980ti and have accumulated about $700 worth of bitcoin in exchange for about $70 of electricity.  It's the best investment that anybody in my family has ever made.  My brother in law (financial degree) found out I have bitcoin and I've likely become the family joke.  They don't understand at any level.  I'd like him to show me all the investments he's made that gained him 10x in 6 months...

Notice I used the word *different*.
All currencies / stores of value (slightly different terms but will lump together for purposes of discussion) have weaknesses.
Gold?  Portable in small amounts, unmanageable in large amounts.  Difficult to subdivide.  Security of it is both simple and difficult -- no need for fancy encryption and blockchains, but somebody busting into your home/safe can take it all.
Fiat? Depends on electricity too, as well as a stable government.  Unless you have buried piles of fiat in your backyard or stuffed them into your mattress, you are like everybody else, and has between $20-500 in your wallet at any given time, and the rest is locked in some digital spreadsheet managed by your bank.
As far as privacy and security goes -- nothing is absolutely secure.  Security has a set of economics associated with it, where the effort expended to attempt to break a security measure must be significantly less than the value of what's trying to be stolen.  Or, in other words, if buy a tank to break into a bank to steal $1,000, you are an idiot.
Hence, all systems can be broken at some level, but the crypto coins out there like Dash and Monero make that value proposition extremely weak.  Their privacy and security features make it extremely difficult and costly to successfully evade those security measures.
As far as scarcity goes, yes, anybody can create a coin.  With Ethereum, *that is by design*.  There is no limit to the number of coins in existence.  However, within each coin, the design of the coin protects its integrity with coin limits to build trust that the system isn't going to inflate away its value.  Fiat is inflated away *all the time*.  That's why our great grandparents paid a nickel for a Coca-Cola, and now you can get one for $2.25.
That being said, each system has their strengths and weaknesses.  One system that the US Dollar has is that if your money is stolen from a bank, you will be repaid in full.  No crypto system has any such ability to allow coin holders to be made whole in the event of theft.  Each system (even within coins) has its own features.
Crypto isn't going to replace other forms, it is going to coexist with them and find its niche, just as credit cards haven't replaced cash entirely.

What you are doing is not "investing", but more akin to "speculation".
Investing involves putting capital into a venture that produces value to shareholders through commerce.  Putting your money in Bitcoin is not investing, I'm guessing you are anticipating that it will be worth more in the future, assuming the Bitcoin economy grows, increasing the commodity value of Bitcoin.  This is speculation.  While you will be helping to stabilize the price of Bitcoin, you would easily have more reliable profit by taking that money and investing in a proven company that pays a dividend.

That's called the "General Lack of Interest" phase.
There's no compelling use for bitcoin in general commerce that isn't already fulfilled by a more attractive or convenient option, and people are starting to realize it now that the buzz has died down.
Bitcoin is the solution in search of a problem for most people.
* It's more cumbersome than cash, and credit/debit cards.
* It experiences extreme short-term volatility.
* There's no direct monetary incentive to use it.  Cards carry bribes like miles, points, and rebates.
* People understand cash. debit, and credit.  No mere mortal understands how *magic internet money* works without a serious explanation. 
* Threat of Bitcoin Wallet getting mysteriously stolen that is non-intuitive.  People understand how to protect themselves from having their cash stolen, and their credit card stolen, but explain to someone that their private key got leaked and that's where all their BTC went and you are going to get anger and confusion.
* Money stolen in (US Bank) account fraud gets replaced.  Fraudlent credit card transactions get refunded.  Fraudulent Bitcoin transactions have no protection.  Nobody will make you whole again if your Bitcoin gets jacked.
* While card transactions are more costly, they are convenient and consumers don't really understand how much card clearing fees inflate the prices of goods and services.
In general, BTC is a poor consumer currency.  There are some transaction types where BTC shines, but for most transactions, conventional forms of payment are executed far more simply.  Unless you are exercising a political motive against fiat, conducting most / all of your consumer transactions makes little sense.
The novelty has worn off and the truth has now been laid bare for all to see.

Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of all time, says [you are not investing, you are speculating.](
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:15:12
They usually are slower to pass on rate increases though.
Every time a business gets paid, somebody else is getting a cut, even cash.  Businesses often have to pay a cash deposit fee based on the amount of cash they are depositing at the bank.  Even if the bank does not charge a processing fee, there's also the risk of robbery when there are large amounts of cash on hand, which is it's own cost.
Credit cards magically solve this issue, because stealing credit card receipts will do nothing for a thief.  You need to hack the cash register or double-swipe into your own card recorder to steal from cards effectively.
As far as those "greedy businesses" go, they are used to getting screwed every single time they take a payment from somebody.  Any relief of these payments would release that stress.  It would allow a business to have more pricing freedom when compared to it's competitors.  You may not see it directly if it were to immediately happen, but it would likely have an effect of prolonging the time until prices are raised again.

Hey buddy can I borrow a $20 for a cab ride home later? (hands cash out of wallet to friend). vs. Hey let's trade bitcoin! Do you have a wallet? Do you have a smartphone? This is how you use it...(15 minutes later)..nobody runs bitcoin because EVERYBODY runs bitcoin...blah blah blah, etc.


'tis true, but many consumers get these cards specifically to get miles and points.  Consumers also use credit cards to build credit so they can purchase homes and cars.  Bitcoin cannot build credit for you.


Never said it did.


Until recently, card surcharges were not permitted as part of the Visa and Mastercard Merchant Agreement.  Businesses had to agree to charge the same for cash or cards in order to be able to accept Visa and MC.
There was a lawsuit by the merchants against Visa and MC, and Visa and MC lost.  Part of the settlement agreement was to no longer restrict merchants' ability to charge different prices for cash vs. cards.  This has not had much effect on the market, as most merchants have chosen not to complicate their sales processes with more than one price for goods.  This has been embraced by a few merchants of low margin commodities like gasoline, but it is not a widespread practice.  Consumers aren't demanding it, and merchants know that consumers will spend more at their stores when using cards.


It doesn't matter if they actually do.  They *think* they understand it, so they have confidence in using it, that's all that matters for consumers to make a choice.


Very true!  Who are you to fight the billions of dollars in marketing that Visa, MC, Amex and Discover throw at consumers though?  The bitcoin community is ridiculously outgunned in this regard.


So, make a complicated process even more complicated?  Consumers can't do complicated or math or thinking.  Consumers are sheep, and sheep don't like to think.


It's absolutely improving.  First of all, you have to understand that keeping your card number secret does nothing to protect you, as you are not the one at risk with your card number being stolen.  You call up Visa, tell them your card was stolen, they wipe the charges off.
Secondly, Chip &amp; PIN, and Chip &amp; Sign are going to be the standard for payment acceptance within months.  After the Target breach, the US card industry bit the bullet and decided to replace magstripes as being the de facto way card transactions are run.  If merchants choose to continue to accept magstripe transactions in the future, they will be fully liable for fraud.  If they use Chip &amp; Sign or Chip &amp; PIN, they will not be liable.  This is what Europe uses, and they have little if any card fraud.


The Federal Reserve Bank says that any consumer account that has money fraudulently removed from it will be made whole by the bank as long as the consumer did not sign for the transaction.  Check fraud? protected.  Online Bank password fraud?  Protected.  You sign a check for a Nigerian Prince?  Money is gone.  Once you sign, your protection from fraud is gone.  I am unsure how this applies to business accounts.


How so?  Member banks pay fees to fund the FDIC in the case a bank goes under, and the Federal Reserve Banks cover account fraud.


Consumers do pay for the system, but not in taxes, they pay for it in banking and transaction fees.


You are missing the point -- if your payment system cannot be explained in 1 minute for how to use it, you've already lost the consumer.  A good portion of the population has difficulty retrieving their e-mail.  You probably aren't going to get these people comfortable with the idea of a crypto-currency and convince them it's secure within 20 minutes of discussion.

...like something to swipe the card a second time with after you run it through the register? ("hack the cash register or double-swipe into your own card recorder")


If I'm a restaurant, and I have $2,000 cash in my register and somebody robs me, that money is *gone*.


Currency risk is huge, so most will likely convert from BTC -&gt; Local Fiat as soon as the transaction is completed for a fee.  What's the point of holding your BTC receipts to save 0.25% transaction fee when BTC value drops 2% over night?  If you do this, then you have to start learning how to hedge against currency risk, or stockpile BTC in the hopes of future price rise.  That's risky, especially for high cashflow businesses.

Investing is what you do with productive business concerns - they use your capital to invest in business activities that bring a return.
Speculation is the buying, holding and selling of as asset in order to beat a market. You can speculate with investment assets (stock for example) and play the price swings.
The daytrading of stocks is an example of speculation with investment assets.
Bitcoin is not a business. You cannot invest in bitcoin to advance business activities to produce a return.
People hoping to make money acquiring btc are speculating. People acquiring btc to protect themselves from fiat inflation or the decline in value of other assets are hedging.
There is no "investing" in bitcoin unless you are running a bitcoin-based business that requires an investment of time or capital to provide services to the bitcoin community.

Then it crashes and it's commnly known as a scam. You"ve got the titans of finance coming out and reminding everybody of how they called this bubble and calling it a big scam.
The thing that makes this different is the perception of failure by the mainstream has permanently damaged the Bitcoin brand in the eyes of the mainstream. Reversing that perception is going to be nearly impossible.
Coin enthusiasts will keep playing with their coins, but mainstream investors are going to pass. That's going to keep the rocketship from going to the moon.

The general public has seen Bitcoin fail as a currency, with its long transaction times, huge transaction fees, and massive volatility.  "Bitcoin is a scam." is common knowledge.
It is now branded as a failure, with millions of mainstream people feeling satisfied that some Internet geeks with magic Internet money who did nothing of value, but became millionaires over a matter of months have now lost their imaginary wealth.
Every investment adviser out there knows that Bitcoin is a toxic asset class, filled with scammers, black market criminals, and possibly brought down by a massive Tether scam.
Every possible effort for the community to get behind coin that isn't as tarnished as Bitcoin will face the skepticism of, "How is this not the same as Bitcoin?"  Magic Internet Money by another name?
Crypto's short-to-midterm future for growth is with blockchain apps in closed ecosystems, and maybe a couple breakout open source apps.  Crypto's future as a value store traded in an open market is dead IMHO.  It will continue to exist, but outside of the mainstream.  There is no rocket fuel for trips to the moon, grandma isn't going to be moving her 401k into crypto assets any time in the next decade.
Bitcoin had its time in the spotlight, and it blew it.  The entire space is tarnished from the past 9 months of chaos.  This crash is the knife twist through the heart.  Any anticipation of crypto becoming a mainstream form of value transfer has been killed by this crash.
People who took the family assets and bought Bitcoin are going to be getting divorced or killing themselves.  Others who bragged about how their crypto assets were making them rich are going to be the laughingstocks of their friends and families.
Next up, all of the financial experts are going to come out of the woodwork and say how foolish all of this was, and that they spotted the bubble from a mile away, which they did.  This will solidify the dismal outlook for cryptocurrency, as people in uncertain times generally do what society tells them to do ("STAY AWAY FROM BITCOIN"), and nobody wants to be embarrassed / made a fool of again for jumping back in.
That is, nobody but the hodlers.  These people have supplanted their reasoning skills for the religion promising a rocket ride to the moon if only they stay pure and true to the teachings of Satoshi.  Back in reality, they were one of the crutches being used to prop up the price, encouraged to do so by a community that would benefit from the price support zealotry.  They have been the first people with their money in, tapping all sources of cash to buy the dips religiously, and will be the last ones selling when BTC is &lt; $3,000.
The day traders are going to have it the worst though.  They don't know what's hit them yet, as every one of their trades that's a taxable event has incurred a tax liability that is due in 2 months, and they are all cash poor, as their assets were held in BTC.
Fortunately, I've dodged this bullet.

A fad is something that was mainstream popular, then disappeared.
Since Bitcoin has never been mainstream popular, it could have never have been a fad.
The only reason anybody really cared about Bitcoin was due to the speculative success of owning Bitcoin.  Mainstream attention was always focused on how quickly it gained value; nobody outside of the nerdspace really cared about the security and currency independence it offered.
The real success of cryptocurrency is going to be when somebody issues cryptodollars or cryptoeuros with fiat equivalence.  Its success will come from shoring up existing fiat, not fighting it.  The low cost and convenience of transferring dollars with the blockchain is what will bring cryptocurrencies popularity in the mainstream.  Currently, the currency risk of Bitcoin is nothing the average person needs.  As long as a cryptocurrency has a fixed fiat denomination, that risk becomes equivalent to paper, taking the fear away.

Nobody outside of the crypto community cares about Bitcoin any more.  The rest of the financial world is actively shunning it.  Stores are dropping their Bitcoin support, banks are one again disallowing transactions for buying crypto.
It's becoming less useful, and something big is going to have to happen to turn that around.  It's reputation in the public's eye used to be "innovative, the future of money!", now it's "a scam / bubble that popped / technology to facilitate crime".
Those trends are very difficult to reverse.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:58:13
I don't see a reason to believe that. I can see a reason to wish thinking that though.
The problem with Bitcoin as a currency is that it is a deflationary asset. While that is a strength for maintaining value, it is a very negative factor for anything hoping to serve as a currency, as it discourages spending. It becomes more advantageous to hold the asset vs. spend the asset. The scarcity actually discourages spending, which causes it to not function like a currency. As difficulty rises, this is only going to get worse, not better as you suggest. The incentive to hold, not spend, is only going to increase as difficulty rises.
In this way, the inflationary nature of fiat is superior. Bitcoin is more like a precious metal than it is a currency. There is a place for this, but not in commerce.

1. You don't need a certification to exchange ideas and learn. If that were the case, reddit would no longer exist. As I said, I have worked in the payments industry, having built my own settlement platform for a startup. I argued to base the app om bitcoin settlement back when bitcoin was emerging. The startup was tied to the ACH network and chose to go that route instead. This was before ApplePay was a thing.
2. The only context under which I was discussing fiats becoming obsolete were as a prerequisite for a deflationary crypto to gain mass adoption as a currency without a new "killer app" feature powerful enough to bridge the gap.
3. Value retention / price stability is definitely a barrier, and I too ascribe to the idea that Bitcoin currently is best thought of like a commodity. The problem with demand / adoption is that there is no existing reason for demand that would lead to adoption, and the headwinds in place (entrenched Visa, MC, Fed, cost of adoption, gov't regulation) don't appear to be changing any time soon.
4. The driving forces behind Bitcoin adoption has been speculation, the desire to acquire a limited resource, the desire to obfuscate one's financial dealings from the government, self-reliance, facilitate crime, technology interest, desire to be part of something new, and the crypto-anarcho desires to resist / undermine / insulate one's self from current financial system and its masters. None of these reasons are appealing to Main Street other than the greed component of speculation. I don't see crypto overcoming these factors without a significant change to the current financial system or improved features / usability of crypto. These things can change, but it does not look imminent. People will buy it, but fear spending it as a violation of the 'HODL' doctrine.
Crypto isn't the only realm of innovation, there is innovation on the side of the existing financial system.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:29:44

Wherever there's a market that can be exploited and manipulated, there will be a bank looking to exploit it.  This is not a product that an investment advisor is every going to put into Grandma's retirement portfolio.
The fact is, there is nothing of value behind Bitcoin other than its trustworthiness and its scarcity, it has no way of generating value like a bond or stock does, there is nothing behind it that creates value, the best it can hope for is to simply *represent* value.
I think other cryptos have different value propositions, but Bitcoin is the poster child of cryptos and it has some real barriers for adoption that will guarantee that it's not used by the mainstream for currency or for real investing.  Bitcoin is the face of crypto, and without a major rebranding effort, all other cryptos are going to be tied to Bitcoin in the public's eye.

People are going to liquidate and spend their most Inflationary assets - this has always been the case and I don't see why this would change. As long as an inflationary currency exists and is widely held and accepted, ithe general trend will be spend before a deflationary asset.
There may be periods where this trend attempts to wax and wane, but the inertia of the marketplace to invest in technology to accept multiple currencies will work to prevent this trend.
There's also demand built into the system with a bias towards fiat, as it is required for settling transactions with the government.
The case for spending deflationary assets rests on the relevancy, viability and availability of inflationary currency. Cash is everywhere. The US Government is printing it as fast as possible, which has the effect of making it both ubiquitious and inflationary - at least while inflation isn't in the late stages of exponential growth.
I'm a fan of the idea that the Federal Reserve should issue fiat-backed blockchain cryptodollars, 1-for1, pinned to USD. It would make technology for blockchain settlement of transactions go mainstream, bringing crypto to retail, p2p, and b2b transactions. Other crypto could ride on the coattails of this technology rollout while getting the public familiar with spending with the blockchain. Unfortunately, this would be a direct competitor to entrenched interests (Visa, MC, AmEx), so it isn't going to be allowed to happen.
Regarding your point of a fixed rate issue of currency not necessarily being deflationary, I'd agree. The deflationary nature of an asset in this context is based not just on supply, but also demand. If the perceived long-term trend is supply &lt;&lt; demand, the asset will be treated as deflationary. If fixed supply is much less than demand, inflationary.
I think the a fiat system has the advantage in this situation vs. an algorithmic creation of currency that doesn't actively create a bias for slight inflation. The unfortunate nature of fiat is that the supply is often exploited by the issuing government.
In short, I don't see how a deflationary asset outspends a viable inflationary one. When the viability of the prevailing inflationary currency is challenged though, that can change.
In very short - when USD fails, the largest adopted, least deflationary alternative gets treated as currency.

It all comes down to trust.  Exposing yourself to illegal dealings forces you to but your trust in places one might otherwise not choose to do.  
The choice to do business here is already entrusting your freedom to an anonymous entity on the darknet.  At any moment in time, the people running the market can turn to the FBI and hand over their entire database and dox everybody involved in these transactions.  If the FBI could take down sellers with the Silk Road database, they can do it with the logs and database from this market too.
My point is, if you are already entrusting your freedom to an anonymous market, tossing some of your Bitcoins into their care too isn't a huge stretch.
However, those who did not take measures to limit their exposure to this possibility need to learn from this.

No, I'm not an economist, but I play one on the Internet. I've also worked in the payments industry.
This is not a subreddit full of economists, to assume otherwise is misguided.
The discussion I was engaging in had to do with the realities of Bitcoin being used in the real world as a currency. My main point is that as long as a viable ubiquitous inflationary currency exists, deflationary assets will not have widespread adoption as as currency.
"Seeing no reason why a deflationary paradigm wouldn't work (assuming we started with it)" is purely hypothetical and doesn't represent the state of our current economic system. I agree that it could work in an environment where a fiat, inflationary currency isn't the established de facto system for settlement, but again, that's not the world we are in.
Given the world we have, as long as the USD or other fiat remains viable and ubiquitous, I don't see a case for adoption of deflationary crypto for mainstream settlement without additional features of the crypto that can bridge this gap. The distributed and privacy features of some coins have caused adoption in some communities (e.g. Monero for use in settlement in illicit transactions) but not for reasons that will appeal to a mainstream audience.

Modern living has taken much of the challenge out of survival.  Imagine the accomplishment people felt when they went into the forest, cleared 1/2 of an acre, and built a cabin with the trees they cleared.  Today, people drive to their retail jobs and sell things for a wage.  The accomplishment in survival is gone, other than the desperation part for a lot of people.
In the absence of real life challenges, we create artificial challenges to achieve a similar sense of accomplishment.  Video games, rock climbing walls, 5k races -- these are all proxy activities for the things we used to do to survive.  Accomplishment is part of the survival instinct, and when we have no accomplishment, we have trouble surviving.
If you aren't constantly upping your game in some way, you are slowly dying.  Unfortunately, many are paid to *not* up their game (people in dead-end jobs that pay too well, trust fund babies, people who get easy money), and money is society's bar for accomplishment.  These people get all of the material reward for accomplishment without any of the personal satisfaction that comes from achieving something.  The money insulates them from what it means to live.

LOL not "cherry picked".
It doesn't matter *when* you are talking about, but a "long term store of value" needs to have stability over a long period of time.  What is long term?  Probably longer than the 2 years Bitcoin has gotten attention.  In that time there's been massive volatility and swings in value.  A "store of value" must be something that is not that volatile.
If the US dollar were 10% as volatile as Bitcoin, the entire global economy would be running from it as fast as possible because people would have little confidence that the value they have today will be there in a week or a month.  People put money in things that have certainty to them given their history.  Gold.  Utilities.  USD.  Land.  That sort of thing.
I'm not saying Bitcoin doesn't have a place or have value, but it is not to be confused with real *long term stores of value*.  Bitcoin is an illiquid, speculative currency functioning in a tiny economy.  The integrity of the currency is highly trustworthy, however its value is questionable in a marketplace of fiat currencies backed by huge governments with massive economies.
Bitcoin is not an investment.  "Investing" in Bitcoin does not provide capital to an enterprise that can gainfully attempt to earn a return for its investors.
Bitcoin is a currency with a couple benefits that fiat doesn't have, and many that it does not.
What it isn't, is a long term store of value, I don't think I'd even call it a short term one.

Good jobs are good things to have, most should have a job, even if their lifestyle doesn't require the income.
People with lots of money mistakenly think they don't need jobs.  
For many, jobs are synonymous with *purpose*, however trust fund babies and people who run into sudden wealth never achieve their full potential because most don't have the focus in their lives to find their purpose without it being part of their employment.  When you don't feel the need to have employment, many never find their purpose (or "a" purpose) and are unhappy.  That's a long-winded way of saying "Idle hands are the devil's tool."
A job creates challenges that you must overcome to meet expectations.  Being a rich kid without a job often comes without achievement or learning how to meet others' expectations.  Sitting around eating pizza and playing XBOX all day creates a wasted life devoid of accomplishment.  Accomplishment fuels happiness.
However, there are some gifted individuals out there who are able to use their wealth to craft their own purposes in life.  Essentially, they make their own "jobs" in a looser sense.  These people are extremely happy because they have both the purpose that comes from accomplishment, and the financial freedom that comes from wealth.  Think Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, etc., but these people can exist at all levels of financial independence, down to your local businessperson who runs civic organizations.

I have thought long and hard about this and the payments industry.  I had to study this for my job for a (failed) mobile payment system I created for a client 2 years ago.  The technology was completely reliable, scalable, and secure at every point of the transaction; the problem was that consumers had no incentive to pick our system over a credit card.
There is nothing easier than a credit card for in-person transactions.  There is little more powerful than the 3-man bribery system the credit card industry has used to insert itself into nearly every transaction in the US.  Raise the prices of every good and service by 4% to accommodate credit card transaction fees, make it an indispensable part of American commerce, "reward" consumers with a slight bribe (miles, points, 1% cash back, whatever) to make them feel like smart consumers, then pocket the rest as profit.
Trillions of dollars of transaction history shows that people spend more when they have access to credit.
The next easiest transaction is cash -- a close second assuming the payment doesn't require a signature.
I don't know a single person who wouldn't take a $5 bill if I handed it to them.  Most people I show a QR code to have a confused look on their faces.
When you use Bitcoin to pay for purchases, you lose a lot.
You lose:
* your ability to reverse a charge if what you buy isn't what you paid for, or if the merchant cheats you.
* You do not have the shoulders of VISA or MasterCard to stand on if a merchant treats you poorly.
* You do not collect miles, points, or rewards.
* You do not have the convenience of deferring a payment for something today until the end of the month.
* You do not get a friendly end-of-year statement categorizing how you spent your money.
* You do not build credit for the large purchases you will need later in life, like houses and cars.
* You do not get reimbursed if your money goes missing.  Unauthorized credit card charges disappear from your bill.  Money taken from your checking account gets replaced.  BTC missing?  That's a rough day.
* You do not have the convenience of financing a purchase you choose to pay for over time.  While I think that last part is a good thing (people shouldn't finance their day-to-day purchases), most of America will disagree.
What you get:
* The satisfaction of knowing if the American Dollar ever loses its place in the world, you've got a backup plan.  (paranoid much?)
* Semi-anonymous transactions (better run your TOR correctly)
* The ability to purchase illegal drugs and materials on any given day that the FBI is not tracking down the buyers, administrators and sellers of the latest incarnation of Silk Road.
* The ability to convey value remotely over the Internet without a middle man.
* You remove the VISA/MasterCard tax from every purchase you make.
* You gain extreme currently risk / volatility from holding your an asset that can fluctuate in value by 10% a day some days.
The value proposition of Bitcoin is interesting, but it is not aligned with the interests of the people who execute 99% of the transactions needed to facilitate life in the Western world.  Bitcoin has a place; it is more than just a conversation piece, but it is not anything that mainstream America is going to rely on any time soon.
What's Bitcoin good for?
* Foreign remittance.  This is amazingly good at this.  Done properly Western Union won't exist in 5 years.
* Buying illegal things anonymously.
* Committing irrevocable transactions -- not a typical consumer transaction.
* Covering your tracks (tokenized transactions), but not really because there's a permanent record that can be reconstructed (blockchain).  You can't tell me the last 3 places that dollar bill was, but I can reconstruct your entire wallet activity, given enough time. Whose wallet is it?  I don't know.
Bitcoin is not a consumer technology.  IDK if you ever followed Linux, but for 10 years, someone in the community would always declare "This is the year of the Linux Desktop!", then eventually that became a joke.  Linux finally embraced what it was good at (server, IoT, reliable embedded, etc.), instead of focusing on trying to be what it isn't (a consumer desktop).  It's a roaring success.
Bitcoin needs to learn something from Linux and embrace what it's good at, instead of trying to shove it at everybody, trying to make it be something it isn't.
Unfortunately the powers that be have a vested interest in getting some BTC into everybody's pocket, as, in theory, that would increase demand and make price go up.  This desire is going to prevent Bitcoin from becoming something it's truly good at, as what it is good at will not make speculators any money, and the investment in Bitcoin is largely by investors hoping to get their BTC to appreciate by creating the Bitcoin economy.
The other unfortunate aspect about Bitcoin in commerce, is that there's no more certain way in the world to shrink the Bitcoin economy then to go to a merchant and use Bitcoin to buy it.  Behind the scenes, 99% of those merchants instantly convert the BTC you just paid with into US Dollars.  They do not want to experience currency risk.  Every time you use a Bitcoin to buy something, that merchant converts it from BTC -&gt; USD, removing that amount of value from the Bitcoin economy.
Bitcoin as a technology is incredible and can change the world.  Bitcoin as an asset class is a failure.  If you took the blockchain technology and had a trusted 3rd party take an asset like an auditable quantity of gold or a fixed amount of fiat currency and issued it in digital form, that would revolutionize how money is exchanged as it would put the currency risk back into the realm of a known quantity.
Bitcoin as an asset is backed only by the trust that the mathematics provides.  For you and me, that is a great thing, but for the rest of the world, knowing that their US Dollar bills are backed by the American military and one of the most vibrant economies of the world is far more powerful.  Most don't understand that fiat currency devalues itself whenever more is created.
The barrier here is poor consumer education on the topic, a technology barrier, unfamiliarity with the concept of digital currency, and existing trust in far more convenient forms of remittance such as VISA, MasterCard and Cash.
Visa and MasterCard spend BILLIONS of dollars reminding consumers that they can't live without them.  Bitcoin has no such army of marketing gurus.
So I gotta say, in response to "But it sure is convenient to use.", I'd have to disagree, for most people it is not convenient at all.

You can come up with expensive ways to charge for credit, but the government won't let that happen to consumers accessing their own savings. Profits from issuing a credit backed product can pay for nice consumer bribes. Margin on asset-backed ebit transactions are much thinner.
Bitcoin is just the "magic internet money" version of a debit system, but it replaces the profit-hungry middle man for the blockchain. Why would you want to purposely add a middleman to add an overpriced incentive system on top of bitcoin? That's diminishing bitcoin's value.
Bitcoin shouldn't be every thing to every person, it should focus on its strengths instead.

Yes, but my time is limited over the next few days.  I will respond at some point, or partially until then.
One thing I will say before you respond, is that human behavior is extraordinarily difficult to change, and costly to influence effectively.
The barriers to change are that people embrace what they are comfortable &amp; familiar with.  Change in any significant form requires constant prodding and reminders, usually in the form of marketing messages, advertising, placement, and incentives for changing behaviors.  This isn't a "Bitcoin Thing", it's a human thing.  If your responses can get past these barriers, I will seriously be impressed.
Any adequate way to overcome this in a commercial setting will require *billions* of dollars, tens or hundreds of them if you want to change the way the world buys things.  Hundreds of millions of people are programmed to behave a particular way, and they fear change.  They are complacent.  They fear loss.  They feel stupid when they make a mistake.  They embrace that which they understand so they neither make a mistake, nor suffer a loss, nor feel stupid.  Look at Apple products - they are wildly successful because at every opportunity, Apple's design has made it difficult to feel stupid using it.  I don't see how Bitcoin is ever going to get to this level.
The only things that sell themselves are free pizza and free beer.
When VISA / MasterCard designed their products (a credit card IS a product), they took all of the human factors into mind.  Every one of these removed a barrier from using their product.
* Fear of losing money?  We will reverse your transactions!
* Fear of making a mistake?  What's simpler than swiping your card?
* Want to feel like a savvy consumer? Earn yourself a "free" trip to Hawaii every time you use our product.
* Want to be a smart consumer?  We will tell you how you spend your money in a nice end of year report.
* Want to know your purchases are safer with VISA?  Free warranty extender for Platinum card members.
* Want to impress your friends?  VISA Black for you, only the best can get it.
* Need help anywhere on the planet using your card?  24 hour toll-free number with friendly customer service reps there to hold your hand.
Every aspect of a modern credit card addresses a human desire or ego.
Nothing about Bitcoin is nearly this attractive.  Bitcoin is functional, and doesn't address consumer needs.  It hasn't been productized.  Visa &amp; MC were able to do what they are doing by charging fees.  If you do that with Bitcoin, you've lost the appeal of it.
Moral of the story, VISA / MC have the whole package in place.  They have spent the last 40 years re-engineering the US and world economies to use their system, and they've got a thousand different ways to keep people coming back.
The other real problem with Bitcoin is that it doesn't operate on a trust model humans are familiar with.  I trust that my bank has an employee with a ledger that's able to tell me how much money is in my account.  Somebody I trust is looking at a written record.  If the numbers are wrong, a history of receipts can be used to correct things.  Same thing with credit cards.  But Bitcoin?  I've been aware of Bitcoin for years, did a tiny bit of mining right when the clients were still alpha / beta and BTC was $15.  Silly me for not sticking with it.  I still can't tell anybody *how* Bitcoin works in a way that they can comprehend.
The story for Bitcoin is one filled with mystery.  As a consumer, I can conceptualize a credit card company keeping track of my individual transactions.  Blockchain???? Nobody in the history of mankind has ever tracked a transaction like this until Bitcoin was launched.  I cannot explain it to my Grandfather, I cannot explain it to my nephew.  People don't like using things they cannot comprehend unless the convenience of using it compensates for their doubts.
Think of Bitcoin as a consumer product, not unlike a car, a computer, a tablet, a phone, and ask yourself, why would I have a landline wired telephone at home, when everybody else on the planet has cell phones?  "Land line phones are more reliable", "The call quality is superior".  Those are admirable traits to have in a product, not much unlike having a currency that is mathematically trustworthy and cryptographically secure.  Well, people want to text and not be tied down to a wire attached to their handset.  They also like their frequent flyer miles and paying for things weeks/months after they buy them.  This is how Bitcoin needs to be considered versus other forms of remittance.  There's simply no obvious reason for any consumer to seek this out.
Anyway, fire away with a response!

You are half right.
Credit cards are a scheme in which Visa and the banks bribe consumers with "points" and marketing to force merchants to accept their product in exchange for merchants paying exorbitant fees that are ultimately absorbed by the consumer in the form of higher prices for goods and services.  It's mostly a scam that provides some feelings of security for the consumer.  On some level they do provide value, but certainly not as much value as they extract out of the economy.
The cards are a cancer.  However, I understand that most are self-motivated, and it would take a lot of selfless action to dethrone the credit kings.  Americans aren't programmed for this much independent action.
The entire system has to revolt and dethrone Big Plastic in order to free us all, but that's simply not going to happen.  Consumers are sheep, and Visa and MC have excellent marketing departments to prevent consumers from having enough independent thought to overthrow their system we are all subject to.
Given a world in which the few enlightened ones who understand the scam Visa and MasterCard are playing on the world isn't going to get significantly challenged, I understand that consumers' self-interested motivation favors the use of credit cards and the reward behavior they have put into the product.
At the end of the day, consumers are sheep, and Visa and MC's marketing knows how to trigger behavior that brings in profits.  The effort it would take to change that is monumental.  Given that, milk the card reward system for all its worth, as you are going to pay for it regardless.
Bitcoin is not the answer unfortunately.

That answer is far from complete.
I've had my card stolen 6+ times, and I've worked in the payment card industry.
Card features are superior to bitcoin in more ways than you mention, especially for the consumer.
First, cards backed by Visa and MasterCard typically credit cards and some debit have either an extended warranty feature or will intervene on your behalf in a merchant dispute. If you cannot resolve a merchant dispute with bitcoin, you are out your btc, nobody will fix it for you. 
Cards often have rewards in place where you earn miles or points. There are no bitcoin point systems.
Cards typically give you a year-end report showing you how you spent your money.  Bitcoin wallets give you lists of bitcoin addresses and any notes you may have added if you bothered.
Cards are taken at millions of merchants around the globe.  As far as merchants who accept bitcoin, [there are dozens of us, DOZENS!]( /s
You carry huge financial risk if your bitcoin wallet is compromised, lost, stolen, or password is forgotten or stolen.  Unauthorized transaction with cards are always refunded to you unless you fail to tell your bank within 48 hours of when you discovered the problem. They make you whole again with a little paperwork.
Cards are extremely simple to use and understand. For most, bitcoin is "magic internet money" that they cannot understand and when they do, may be fearful of deleting their wallets.
The downsides:
Goods prices are slightly inflated to account for the cost of clearing cards vs less expensive forms of payment. There are costs for every form of payment, even cash.
While merchants are on the hook for card fraud, merchants make a lot more money than that by accepting credit cards and can serve more customers because of the speed of card transactions. Consumers buy more when they have access to credit, which leads to greater profits which fraud bites in to. Card transaction speed is slowing down with slow chip readers though.
Merchants can accept cards using offline transactions and process them later. They accept risk with that, but for some merchants they can accept that risk.
Is the system secure? Nope. But it has strengths, and every system has a weak link. There is real risk of loss for consumers with bitcoin, and no risk with cards, that's the biggest. My grandma can use cards easily, however I wouldn't trust her with more than $20 in a bitcoin wallet. Yes merchants feel card fraud, but they typically earn more from extra sales by accepting cards than it costs them.  Keep in mind merchants are willing participants in accepting the fraud. I know they don't like it, but it comes with access to cards.
That being said, consumers would be better off if credit cards didn't exist, but they do, and bitcoin is never going to eliminate credit cards, because people want access to credit.
For the record, I think bitcoin is a great value store, a great money transfer vehicle, but inferior method of payment for consumers in Western markets.

While you are technically correct about the collateral, the magic of consumer credit cards is that it is *unsecured debt*, not requiring collateral, just your signature and an inquiry to the credit bureau.
The fees on debit are extremely low, and they are regulated in the US, limiting the fees that may be assessed on cardholders and transactions. Debit cards typically have very meager rewards programs if they have one at all.

Show me a bank that will lend you bitcoins. Credit cards are loans with lots of fees, that's what pays for all of the consumer features (extra warranty, points, merchant dispute resolution, reversable transactions, etc.) of a credit card. Bitcoin is asset-based, not debt based. The people who want bitcoin have rejected using debt for money, it's completely different.
What you are suggesting is relevant to debit cards, and I'm aware of at least two debit card products for bitcoin.

Sorry, I should have said "exchange:", Outlook is the Exchange Client that also does SMTP.  Exchange is Microsoft's proprietary messaging protocol that only Outlook speaks.
Payment is the scheme here.  We need a mechanism for *paying* driven by a URI scheme.  If Bitcoin wants to be treated like *just another currency*, it needs to act like one.  We need a URI scheme for *currency* facilitating online payments, as pricing and payments may be denominated in multiple currencies.
It would be preferable to specify a *payment amount* in the currency denomination, then register individual wallets that handle those currencies.  Each currency should be granted an [ISO currency code](
If the bitcoin scheme were abstracted one more layer to a generic payment scheme, a standard placement for currency and currency code could would allow *any* currency to utilize the same structure, as long as the browser allowed you to register handlers (wallets) for each currency code.
"payto:(currency code)(delimiter)(amount)(delimiter)(address)?(params)"
In this way, you could register your bank's *checking account* wallet app to handle USD, and the address could be specified as a physical address or recipient identifier, and your bank could issue a check through snail mail or through EFT (for paying utility bills for example).  It would be a good idea for a CA to sign the e-bill recipient identifier (if used) in order to verify identity, as anonymous payments are not a feature of bank drafts.
It would work the same for BTC or any of the other cryptocurrencies, only the wallet app and URI parameters would be different.
Instead, *every* currency is going to need their own scheme, and every browser is going to have to be updated with those schemes as they become available, etc.
**TL;DR - bitcoin: URI scheme = a big mess.  It could have been better.**
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:30:10
Wow, the internet would have collectively screamed if Microsoft would have gotten "outlook:" put into the spec. I think adding "bitcoin:" is a bit premature and not well thought out.
The idea of favoring one crypto currency over all others is just as bad as the idea that there will be a scheme defined for *every* crypto currency.
I think a "wallet:" scheme or a "payto:" scheme with a currency registration / specifier would have been much more appropriate and modular.

Push it into the shadows.  Make it illegal for legitimate businesses to conduct transactions in that currency.  When you take out the *legitimate market use* of a currency away, the only thing left are p2p transactions and illicit markets.  Also, make it illegal for banks to service Bitcoin accounts in a similar way to how they don't serve online casino transactions.  You cannot use an American credit card or bank account to fund an online poker or casino account -- those transactions are blocked.
This would make Bitcoin *irrelevant*.

That is just a documentation requirement that is subject to government inspection if requested.  If the transaction exceeds $10,000 in value (for gold...or anything else for that matter), then IRS reporting is *required*.

Bitcoin isn't a completely suitable replacement for remote or deferred transactions, as there is no way to reverse a transaction if a service provider / seller does not complete their end of the deal.  In order to guarantee such a transaction, somebody is going to have to issue a prepaid card denominated in BTC in order to provide this service.  They will then be needing to charge a fee for such service which would settle disputes the same way Visa and Mastercard do.
Until Bitcoin allows you to dispute a transaction like Visa and Mastercard does, it is going to remain fringe for remote and deferred transactions.  I think it will have growing popularity, but it will remain a novelty currency for most legitimate transactions that don't take place in person.
It will remain popular for illegal transactions, such as drugs, paying terrorists, buying illegal weapons, prostitution, etc. simply because it is difficult (if not impossible) to trace.  However, governments will begin to ban transactions of this nature *because* they are untraceable.
In-person transactions, and transactions between trusted individuals will be popular, but the government is going to start requiring traceable transactions and bring the Bitcoin exchanges under banking law so there can be financial oversight from financial crime (tax evasion, money laundering, etc.).  If drug cartels are not already using BTC for remittance, I would be surprised.  The currency risk for BTC day-to-day trading prices is less than the risk of a money truck getting seized at the border being sent back to Mexico.
Currently, US Government tracks every transfer of currency larger than $10,000.  This is to have a way of identifying money launderers and people who under-report their income to the IRS.  They are not going to let people skirt these reporting requirements simply because a transaction is in BTC.
They will do this in the name of *fighting terror*, *fighting the drug war*, and *fighting child exploitation*.  In reality, it will be to prop up the current fiat financial system and private banks who lobby Washington and get the rules written the way they like.
It is a digital form of [Hawala]( which the US Government took under regulation after September 11th attacks because it provided untraceable means of remittance that "funded the terrorists".
The central banks will align against this, and the governments will start punishing businesses that openly accept Bitcoin payment for this reason.  It will be to covertly protect fiat currency supremacy, but overtly to defend against money laundering and other illicit transactions.
Give it 3-5 years and the US Government will make it illegal to conduct business in btc.  It will take them awhile to *catch up*, but the minute they find a terrorist with a Bitcoin account, expect the market to ~~crash~~ be negatively affected, because where you find terrorists one day, you find the Department of Homeland Security the next.
The European Central Bank is already going to be looking at bitcoin because of people in Cyprus and Spain converting their Euros into BTC out of fear of the central banks taking more depositors' money.  If the ECB or EU nations don't make Bitcoin transactions illegal because of this, the US Government will surely bring them *on board* with their regulations from anti-terrorism activities.  Then bitcoin users will become outlaws.
It fun, it's exciting, it's interesting, but the Man is going to keep it down before it gets *too big*.  It will not be banned because it doesn't work *well enough*, it will be banned because it works *too well*.
