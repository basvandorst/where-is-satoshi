Enki123 sold the rights to the project to the two people listed at founders here:  Cedric Dahl and Bennett Hoffman
Cedric and Bennett then went on to raise 1.6 million dollars in cash.

I can only assume the intention was to use the branding of the open-source project to gain credibility.
The original project was purchased from [enki23]( by the organization that is now "Buttercoin". The details of this sale are not public.
I wonder how much money was made by enki23 just for selling the Buttercoin brand.

Wonder if this has to do anything with "Spoofy" and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the US.

I'm sorry "Spats_McGee", but you can provide any actual insight to what JP Morgan, or any other banks have developed internally?
I appreciate your personal opinion on their technology, but without any real information you aren't really saying anything.
Really, do you have any information to share about what the big banks are working on? I'm interested to learn more.

We shouldn't forget that Jamie Dimon is one of the smartest and most ruthless people on Wall Street.
It's not because of dumb luck that he's in the position he is in today. 
He did have a pretty valid point. Most likely the major banks will implement their own BlockChain technology and then put massive pressure on congress to use their tech, versus Bitcoin.
We'll have to see what happens.

I agree with what you are saying.
The governments in theory can't "ban" a distributed P2P technology ( outside of very advanced network traffic shaping ).
What the government, can, will, and does do, is regulate the choke points. Who they target is a question of volume. The highest volume players are prime targets for litigation ( think Coinbase). The banks can also refuse to do business with people attempting to take large amounts of cash out from Bitcoin related business ( we've already seen this with Chase ).
In the context of our discussion, BlockChain can be synonymous with triple-entry-accounting. I can't speak for Jamie Dimon's technical ability. What I do know is that the major banks have been running into serious issues with double-entry booking systems while trading back and forth with each other. They have been running dark pools for years, but the accountability for assets has been primarily on the banks themselves to establish on every trade.
This is problematic, because there is little to stop the banks from screwing each other. I can imagine Jamie understands the value of establishing a distributed ledger which if maintained between every major banking entity, can ensure that only the "right" people get screwed ( smaller banking entities / smaller countries entire economies ).
I've worked with / met some of the developers who work on the software which powers these dark pools. I've worked with a lot of developers. The developers who work for these organizations are some of the smartest people in the world, and Jamie Dimon is one of the people who employees them.
Do I personally agree with any of this? No. Am I pragmatic? Unfortunately yes.
