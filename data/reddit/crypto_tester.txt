Another great video by [The Crypto Bubble]( (Lil Bubble)
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:37:28
there are actually several youtube videos about it... I also saw (e.g. search "youtube" in LBRY) some people pre-warned about a youtube purge a few days before it happened.
@_date: 2019-12-26 09:07:09
except that the scamming youtubers are still up, and the guys affected are good people explaining good stuff, e.g. That Martini Guy was actually exposing crypto scammers. Ivan On Tech explaining crypto in easy words, so that normal people would understand.

Alessio Rastani (listed in the post picture): it seems that all his content is all up (compared to other YTbers who had to make all their videos private)

Nice painting, after people debate about the title, it would be nice if you share the title you gave to your painting ;) but let the discussion go for a while, no spoilers please ;)
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:20:44
First of all: nice painting!
Given the uniform of the walker, I'd call this painting rather "Moonseeker".
Or: "Moonseeker must go thought lightning first". In fact, if lightning will help mass adoption of bitcoin, finally the moonseeker will see the moon price he was seeking ;)
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:09:19
Exactly, this. Also if bitcoin goes to the moon, you don't want many people to know that you have 1 BTC. There is also a saying "Don't put all your eggs in the same basket": having different wallets, or leaving some little amounts in different exchanges, ready to be sold and to cash out in case, is also not a bad idea.

I doubt banks would be that stupid and allow that... normally banks always win, not people.

This (not Satoshi) Mr Nakamoto wanted privacy and his photo is all over the web and reposted/used all the time... also he could not pose better, the photographer that took this photo is a genius... isn't it funny? :)

I'd like to use native segwit addresses, but I'm afraid some exchanges may not support them. So I created an "hybrid" wallet with electrum that create addresses that begin with "3". I've read that this is compatible with old wallets and new segwit ones. So it's like a transitional wallet until everybody uses segwit. Thoughts?
OP asked if there is a list of exchanges that support native segwit... would be nice to see.
If I move my funds to a bc1 address, I want to be sure I can send those to any exchange...

ok let's use 5 grin to buy a pizza, to see it 10 years in the future priced at 100k and regret we did throw away half a million to buy a stupid pizza...

Good thoughts, but you can say this anywhere. I mean, think about the people that work their butt in the office, doing overtime, accepting to stay long and sacrificing sometimes even the weekend, for what? Not even a promotion.
At least with crypto we have alarms, limit orders, stop losses... we don't need to think about the price all the time. This stuff can be semi automated, or even fully automated.
E.g. sometimes during a cloudy day if I spot a good "setup" to go outside (e.g. the sun shows up), as a day trader I place a stop loss, a take profit order and I go out. No need to check the candles all the time and I go out and do some sport. I just did it, now I can stay 'till midnight, back studying crypto ;)

Check the bitfinex subreddit, some people seem to troll it, I mean some positive people are accused to be bitfinex employees, some others seem to FUD so I don't really know if it's worth it... also consider high fees to withdraw.
E.g.: [
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:54:54
On bitfinex it's already over 6k, but it's known that on bitfinex prices are 6% higher these days...
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:02:52
Is there any record about this? If people donated, sure there is a bitcoin address we can check, just for curiosity. I wonder how much he received for having his photo circulating in the web forever...
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:12:40
Chapeau to all those early nerds that actually mined thousands of bitcoins at the early days... and HODLed them or sold a bit at the end of 2017 or in the last days ;)
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:29:57
Maybe people will trade, but won't withdraw crypto. At kraken, e.g. to withdraw USD the fee is 5 USD, but only 0.09 EUR for EUR withdrawals (SEPA).
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:27:46
Thanks for your reply. What about the "not your keys, not your coins" use case? Say you have your own wallet right now with only 0.01 BTC in it (which at current 7k price it's only 70 USD). At 1 million, this little amount is gonna be worth 10k and probably you won't want to send it all to a lightning channel. That 1 single transaction from your own wallet, you probably won't be able to batch it together with many other transactions (as all decent exchanges do) and you'll have to pay the fees from your pockets...
...the fee cost sat/bytes will probably increase during time, right?
So in the end I wonder if it will be really worth to keep "small" amounts like 0.01 BTC in a privately controlled wallet. It seems better to me to keep such fractions in an exchange.
Thoughts about this?
@_date: 2019-05-16 08:34:20
Thanks, yes it helps but it still looks a bit complicated. So the average Joe will probably think that the compatibility wallets are the best, since they can send and receive to both old and new addresses. But from what I've read, the compatibility addresses use a wrapper, which will make transactions use more space (and more space means more bytes, right? Since fees are payes in sat/bytes, more space wasted means more fees to pay, not "save up" (using segwit was the main point to save up fees)).
Also, what happens if, e.g. from Electrum I try to send BTC from an old wallet (address beginning with 1) to a bech32 address (address beginning with bc1)? Will Electrum be smart enough to show an error/prompt that it's not possible, will the funds be lost or what happens?
Also it's not clear if I will save up fees using the compatibility wallet, or to save up fees I need to use the pure segwit wallet...
Sorry for the noob questions, but for mass adoption I think things should be simple, and we are far from simplicity yet...

OMG what a moron and a sick person is this CW, more I read about him and more I facepalm myself...
Why can't he just be himself instead of pretending to be Satoshi. It's like a kid that pretends to be superman at all costs... except if you ask the kid to fly like superman, he wouldn't really be able to do so...
...just like asking any Satoshi-wannabe to transact some of the initial bitcoins he mined. Could he do that?
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:35:42
Thank you, I've checked the list and seen that most of the exchanges I use, e.g. binance, coinbase, kraken have "send only" support. If I understand correctly "send only" means that the exchange can send to bech32 addresses? But if I want to send from my bech32 wallet to the exchange, the exchange can't receive?
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:56:52
I don't think it will fail just because of such a reason. It's a rare and deflationary asset and if people will give it value (see this bullrun, seems people FOMOing are giving it value) they will also learn how to make the best use of it. We know that using bitcoin directly is expensive and slow (but secure), we have lightning network for cheaper and fast transactions, so it seems to me natural that bitcoin can succeed thanks to its security and thanks to lightning. Of course nothing is granted, but this scenario seems realistic to me.

This is really beautiful! If you like a bit of splatter for more fun, it would me nice (to me at least, since I like dark humor) a version where "8000" has a face and also eyes... Since the original epic scene in Game of Thrones was when The Mountain actually jammed his thumbs into Martell's eyes until the head exploded :)
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:44:09
Congrats but... be careful, because a real "gangsta" could actually steal your bitcoin.
So I suggest you to secure your keys well enough.
