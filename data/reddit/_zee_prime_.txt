You'll get pretty far with C, Python, and JavaScript.

As if that negates my point in any way. You're talking out of your ass.

That sort of blatant market manipulation is illegal though, and both Gemini and CBOE are regulated and know exactly who is trading what.

This is assuming the rest of the market will let Gemini take the lead. I can't even keep track of how many exchanges exist nowadays, and Gemini makes up just a fraction of the volume, so it's unlikely massive selling on Gemini alone would do much to the market. It would be a huge risk to take, as it's likely other traders will scoop up the cheap coins on Gemini if other exchanges ignore the games being played.

Blah, blah, blah...you're so full of shit, talking about how everyone underestimates this or that. You clearly overestimate your own intelligence.

I can understand where you're coming from, but as an advertiser jumping from trend to trend, you're prone to overlook the finer details of what led to a trend in the first place, because you weren't there. I've been in the trenches for almost 6 years now. What's going on now isn't just about the media attention, Wall Street, or exponential price growth. Bold projects that have been in the works for years are finally coming to fruition, real use cases are emerging, and nearly a decade of proven security is on the books. These details don't really matter to an advertiser, and if all you're looking for is a trend, you can't really comprehend what is going on with Bitcoin right now or where it leads. Advertising is just about eyeballs, it's not about understanding innovation.

True in many cases, but in the case of BofA, it's not about spending capital on research and development, but rather spending money on lawyers to file every patent possible and see what sticks. They're not innovating a damn thing and they're a perfect example of how broken the current system is.

No, you don't know what you're talking about. Look at the patents being filled by BofA. Their team probably consists of a few software engineers as well, but they're just going through the tech and assembling patents on as many parts of the tech as they can. The patents being filled are ridiculously generic.

Nothing says "FUTURE" like msn.com
