Upvote because this reply was closest to an actual ELI5 lol

Get your pitchforks! Let's blame everything on u/bitcoinfloridagator

Does that mean transactions on lightning networks are untraceable? Or would the fact that they're "smart-contracted" make it highly traceable. 
Thanks for the indepth explanation!

Could I get an ELI5 explaining what a lightning network is/does?
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:09:34
What does this mean for the average user? How does the wallet change the way I'll do transactions?
I'm legitimately asking - I don't know.

We, here, won't be alive to see that day.
But, hey, prove me wrong. I dare you.

So you're saying it's perfect?

Thanks, guys. It's really humbling to be up there amongst the greats of this awesome community. Now, my kids will proudly know that their father has done something with his life.

What good is it if I eat it?
@_date: 2019-03-16 18:20:03
So is that why the lightning network exists or is it also against decentralization?
@_date: 2019-02-25 02:56:15
Please elaborate

What do you mean by "use paper"?
@_date: 2019-02-27 16:21:54
Those people are courageous. I wouldn't trust myself to keep a piece of paper (worth Lamborghinis) for 10 years.

Thanks, going to read up on it now

Is it okay to have samourai or mycelium on my every  day usage mobile phone?
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:36:25
Just think about the fees he has incurred...
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:13:08
If he buys me a house he can do whatever he wants to my butt.

Bebo.
