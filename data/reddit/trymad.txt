I guess it's not , I speak both arabic and french and you can't imagine the number of forums where people use HashOcean. (same for English forums)

How bad this is going to affect the Bitcoin price in your opinion ?

Yes . a Cloud mining company that scammed thousands of people. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:06:38
It's their statistics that says so , so I couldn't tell for sure;
I personally think that they actually had taht amount of investors on their website because I speak both french and arabic and I know the best forums out there with these languages , and HashOcean is promoted almost everywhere .

Sorry you had a bad experience with them but I heard a lot of things about them to be honest .

I'm having an issue connecting since 1-2 hours now , sometimes I get an error about secure connection (SSL) :  and sometimes It tells me that website is simply not responding.
I was only able to access the website once since then.
