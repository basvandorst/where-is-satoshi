YouTube has taken down this video saying "This video has been removed for violating YouTube's Terms of Service" Message- Video removed: Inappropriate content. 
Can anyone help me appeal the YouTube claim and get the video back up. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:19:05
I posted a YouTube video of Onecoin seminar in Melbourne and after 3k views YouTube took it down.. Onecoin will rip off and say anything if they think it will keep their ponzi scheme going. Its very sad for all concerned.

"Another theory is that Chinese computer programmers have sharply stepped up their "mining" of bitcoins."
Quality journalism. :)

its worth a dollar to me to help a genuinely interested fellow human being start using bitcoin because i believe in the many positives bitcoin can have in the world.. if you start using it and start to realise the same as i do, you will most likely want to share this knowledge also. 
offers to trade? use one of the major exchanges. people have posted that already. or use localbitcoins.com or find a bitcoin atm machine- use coinatmradar.com
no ones transactions are truly anonymous with bitcoin as they are all on the blockchain. Your'e name is not attached to the transaction though. just like reddit, i dont know you do i? But we can still communicate right? So why shouldnt we be able to send each other money if we want? Why should Mr Banker be involved? Bitcoin makes banks obsolete. Bitcoin is amazing as it offers monetary freedom. We can share money as easily as sharing ideas. 
Good luck. 
Peace.

i downloaded vlc and it worked. audio only worked ok.. cheers. Andreas is a legend. :)

Well done for earning and owning bitcoins. Doesn't it feel great to be part of this revolutionary socio economic experiment. :)
Peace out.

I'm glad we amuse you! To answer your deconstructions, 
1) heres some happy 'trusted' paypal customers 
2) do you work for govt? do you think julian assange and edward snowden should be kept from being able to tell the truth? (Wikileaks)
3) Who is encouraging illegal activity? You think bitcoin persuades people to change from being honest to dishonest?
Bitcoin is not asking for your participation, but its available for those who want to use it. Bitcoin is an alternative to the current financial system who many believe is no longer serving the world in a positive way. eg, bank bail outs, continued wars funded by limitless debt creation. 
Peace.

How about donating to different charities around the world? How about tipping people on social media for the quality for their work? How about supporting organisations who seek to bring is the truth that are blacklisted by visa and co? How about not supporting a currency that is used to fund wars and global suffering, financial exclusion and helping to excel the wealth transfer to the top 1%. They are a few good reasons no? Peace.

Well done to you for creating this really useful Bitcoin resource website. I also believe that Bitcoin ATM's help to increase awareness to more people. Keep up the great work. Much appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:42:08
me too :( anyone help please? 
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:47:00
Some feedback on the site... on the home page I think you should have the menu tabs across the top of the page (above the map) so people can see them more easily. Having them at the bottom left underneath the manufacturer lists means people may miss much of your content.. Cheers.  
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:16:49
Would you, and/ or the core dev team consider taking a % of their income in donations from the Bitcoin community rather than all from the foundation? A hybrid model of central and decentralisation. Among other benefits, this would help people feel more involved and supportive to your work. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 04:54:43
Told you the price would go up didn't I?! 
Maybe ill start selling my 'bitcoin price prediction' crystal balls on Ebay. :)

Look awesome. Is it in production or available to buy now? If so, how much will you retail it for?

Good morning BITCOIN!! Spread the gospel of the good book, Bitcoin, Thomas, good work! Be careful of those crazy burners wanting to take you to 'the moooooon'! :)

Thanks for sharing. In your doc:
'The last reward is on track to be mined at some point in 2040, at which point miners will be rewarded with small transaction fees included in each block.'
I believe its 2140 when the final bits will be mined. 
Also, not sure if this is the best way to explain bitcoins security: 
"Private keys are not stored on any central server the way Target stores customer credit card information or the way banks store account passwords, so Bitcoin cannot be hacked."
Maybe a note to the reader on the need to educate themselves on how to store bitcoins safely off line with paper wallets and/or cold storage (usb stick)
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:19:44
Decide what number you class as 'mass adoption'. Then decide how many bitcoins each person would want to buy. For instance, if 13 million people wanted to buy a whole bitcoin each, then there wouldn't even be enough to go round. More buyers than sellers, price goes up. Question is, how many people will want bitcoins in the future? Thats why businesses are being built to try and make it happen.

Ok so the easiest way to do this is for us to set up a copay wallet with a multi sig - 2 of 3. However we will need a 'trusted' third part to authorise the payout to one of us. Otherwise it will need to be coded using a data feed from ASX website for the stock price, which will take dev time. Ive spoken to Lucas Cullen who has a high public profile in the Australian Bitcoin community and he has said he'd be happy to be the third signature to release the funds. Here's his credentials:
If your'e happy with this, we need to set up a Copay wallet. 
The Bitcoin Group share price info will need to come from ASX site and will need to drop to AU 10cents within first 12 months of listing for you to win. Cool?
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:40:01
Bitcoin Group did have enough working capital for 12 months according to the report.. So much of the media mis reported that.. The regulator didn't allow an AU $500 per btc price model for the next 12 months.. All up, very sad for Bitcoin Group battling to list for so long...  
@_date: 2016-03-10 11:05:24
At least they gave it a go. It would of been great for the Bitcoin ecosystem to have a bitcoin mining company successfully IPO in such a tough regulatory climate.. At least we now know there's over 500 investors with $5.9m in Australia, willing to back a bitcoin mining company.. to be continued.... 
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:13:53
What a legend!

I helped Urban Velocity sign up with BitPOS. They are based in Sydney but i found them to be really supportive. He only accepts bitcoin in store at the moment, the e-commerce shopping cart will come later. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:48:55
Ok cool, so your bottom dollar is only half a bitcoin? :) I'll speak to my dev friend and get back to you with how this can be set up. Before I spend anytime on this please show me you have 0.5btc. 
I've sent 0.5btc to a newly generated wallet now to show I have the funds. 1Cr664YjUJscpsahBUAW7hhhz4gNkUtQ7n. Please do the same and post the public key here. Then I'll spend time getting a bitcoin escrow set up and get back to you.
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:54:26
hey mate! No, it seems like he wet his pants and disappeared. Thanks for your help anyhow. :)
@_date: 2016-01-25 10:12:24
The Bitcoin Group team have invested years of their lives in Bitcoin and persisted with trying to become the worlds first bitcoin mining IPO on a major stock exchange. I'm pretty sure their ops manager, who has years of experience in the semi conductor industry would know which machines would be a good investment for the company. There will be plenty of nay sayers in the mainstream media, I'd kinda hope r/bitcoin would offer a bit more support considering the sheer effort something like attempting a Bitcoin Mining IPO takes. If BCG are successful, hopefully they will inspire more bitcoin start ups to do the same. :) 
@_date: 2016-01-14 01:13:03
Ok cool, I'm setting it up now. The Bitcoin Group IPO close date is 25th Jan and listing on ASX is scheduled for 2nd Feb so we have plenty of time. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 04:28:55
Maybe they have plans to buy newer machines seeing as their proposed purchases as written in their prospectus is subject to change. I doubt they will be buying inefficient mining machines. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 07:30:08
Looks good except for the decimal point is in the wrong place! It should read $0.10 AUD. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:06:55
OK, I'll take your bet. I'll put up 1 bitcoin. We can lock them into the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-03-16 06:01:35
That would indeed be awesome! I will add them to my list. Thanks. Any smaller Melbourne retailers you would like to see accepting bitcoins? Thanks
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:59:28
All you need is a smart phone and a free account with a payment processor (if you want the fiat conversion) who will deposit the dollars into your bank acc the next day. If you want to hold the bitcoins then you can be set up in under 5 mins. I recommend using Airbitz mobile app.. It has great accounting functionality too.. 
When you say 'clearly not functioning currency', where does the $4 billion network valuation come from? Its still early days but wouldn't it be cool if everyone could send and receive money, regardless of where they are from? Send me your bitcoin address and ill send you some money. I don't know another currency we could do that with..    
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:03:59
All of them would be great! Maybe in the not too distant future, all of the stores will have Bitcoin as an option integrated into their POS.. I was kinda looking for local recommendations from people who were keen to see their local shops start accepting bitcoins. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:40:26
Great, thanks.. I actually ride a Honda myself and know a couple of the guys who work at the Elizabeth St bike shops. Some will have online stores too.. Cheers.
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:47:18
Check out this site which i found useful.  
The pick of the bunch was bitcoinmaps.info and also the Airbitz mobile app wallet and website has a merchant directory which is by far the best I've seen to date (and the best bitcoin wallet app IMO). I agree that some of the maps are not current, i guess its up to the community to keep the listings updated by contacting the directories. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:05:41
Great, i'll add those to the list! Are there any smaller, independent retailers in Melbourne you would use your bitcoins? Thanks 
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:00:25
Great thanks, i will add them to my list. :) 
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:53:28
Great idea! I like it. Bitcoin is a grass roots voluntary currency and most people don't know its benefits.. Let's use people power to help grow its use. What date do you have in mind for this global outreach campaign??

@_date: 2016-07-30 23:03:45
you're right, it doesn't help getting angry but hopefully the people at the seminar may think twice about investing in Onecoin and investigate how crypto currency actually works. If all bitcoiners around the world go to these events and ask questions, less people will be scammed and hopefully more people will learn about real cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:19:14
