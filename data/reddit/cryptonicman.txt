I know... I was being a bit cheeky though. And honestly, for cryptos, the idea of what a bank really is continues to change constantly in a sense.

Coinbase is a bank. It is probably run by the FBI or DEA as a money laundering front for the government and I happily use it successfully without issue.

Since you somehow brought Christianity into this, no church that has filed tax exempt status is a church for Christianity. 
They are just a tax haven for people making money.
 
This in no way has anything to do with what Jesus said in the Bible. 
Jesus actually said "pay Caesar what is due to Ceasar". Jesus paid taxes, and told his followers to pay taxes also.
So what I'm saying is this, almost every reason that most people hate Jesus and God and Christianity has nothing to do with Jesus and God and Christianity, but everything to do with the religious system that is not of Christ, but is of the Antichrist. 
You have been deceived and you now hate the wrong thing.
In the Bible Jesus actually stood against the religious system of his time. Does anybody even understand that the leaders of Jesus's own religion were the ones to kill him to protect their power?

My apologies - I was simply trying to point out some things from the bible and the Christian experience that most people don't know. And honestly, check yourself if you think Trump is a Christian - we are ALL manipulated by deceptive media and are tricked into hating each other for no reason.
I mean honestly did you know that Jesus said pay taxes? Did  you know that the spirit of Antichrist is leading organized religion in most churches that claim to be "christian" churches?
Do you seriously not find it fascinating the Jesus said pay taxes, but most "christian" churches are TAX EXEMPT?
I think it is amazing whether a person believes in the bible or not.
Check this out:
13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 
14 No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
15 Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness
