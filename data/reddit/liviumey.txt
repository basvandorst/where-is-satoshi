Wow... like ether.. cool!

Bitcoin might have more value.. because btc/usd rate would not change proportionately with the usd value loss..  it would probably outpace

@_date: 2017-02-02 18:19:23
Maybe s11 started mining?

Numbers are important..  if a chain has a significant amount of power i guess it could wate some hashes to attack the weaker one
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:43:48
i guess.. any kind of attack would have a serious impact on prices for all bitcoin types or chains.. im sure the attacker would try it only if profit can be made.. even on longer time

I wonder how much would cost to have 5k new nodes
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:46:13
Way too fast for an organic grow..
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:32:47
1. Or maybe  ppl like me just try to make normal transactions and bitcoin core wallet sets a very low fee... my trans is in mempool for 2-3 days now... and i thought the fee was high... (about 75% from max on that bar)
@_date: 2017-04-14 08:49:47
Changed tactic.. fighting for perception instead of signals ddos es hashes and other..
Will be interesting..

Now i realise..he probably did

So - bitcoin.org says: 
BitPay (United States)
Blockchain.info (UK)
Circle (United States)
Coinbase (United States)
Xapo (United States)
ShapeShift (Switzerland)
and 90% of miners
minority community support
who's the majority?
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:13:31
Only ico ban.. exchanges not yet.. nor the bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:55:08
And how do you think they would agree bitcoin.org ? 
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:13:08
Does that mean btc will go to 100k? Why didnt you say earlier
@_date: 2016-10-18 07:13:07
Crypto markets dont fail.. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:20:16
Even if bought otc. He might still drive the price up... simply because the seller did not dump on exchanges.
@_date: 2016-10-18 07:27:34
Cryptocoins markets did not fail.. they are free..  and a couple of years old.. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:32:36
How much for ether in 10yrs? .. thank you
@_date: 2017-07-14 06:33:26
Maybe he forgot a password or something..
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:27:20
Ppl dumping alts... -&gt; btc up.. so they can dump btcash later.... there will be a dump
@_date: 2016-07-22 07:20:07
Have to go.. can t  finish this text...i understand hf is so bad... cos immutable etc... but did you say anything about this guy stealing from us?
@_date: 2016-07-25 07:37:40
ok.. just FYI... contract is not law.. even if signed.. still has to obey the law
@_date: 2016-07-24 20:32:55
code is more like a rule.. not law 
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:36:56
They are all on ether..
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:57:32
And he is romanian also.. that s another bright side.. :) .. and yet..
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:36:53
Wow! What a gift!
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:28:35
Buy low.. sell high.. that is what they say..Been there.. done that! sold ALL my 2k genesis ethers  - 30$ range... was a hard moment... so so stupid decision..
@_date: 2016-07-24 20:44:23
you know.. stealing is bad in any situation..bad is.. not good! you dont even want to think one step outside of that "contract=law" (which is so not true btw)
Even if I sign a contract (sure.. without reading) where it says: you must take good care of my house but you dont have to lock it.. and someone  takes all from it.. that is.. stealing! 
@_date: 2016-07-22 09:08:42
I know stealing is not such a bad thing these days ... maybe I understand in a different way "stealing"...
