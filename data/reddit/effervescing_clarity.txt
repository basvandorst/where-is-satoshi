I'll give it a shot. In game name is user348.
Edit: Alright I played it and it reminds me a lot of satoshimines, with a chat and user investment option. Pretty fun but I'd caution users that dice casinos with user provided bankrolls have not fared well in the past. Site operators have run with funds and cheated and played against the bank. That being said, its pretty fun and the site appears to be well constructed. I'll be keeping an eye on this.

Bought at 440 panic sold at 550 after it dropped from 580. I still made a tidy lil sum. Kicked myself the next week when it jumped to 660 could've made another 3k oh well.

I'm having the same problem. I sent a request for a password reset link to support 2 days ago. I'll update if they send it. I imagine it might take a while with all the stuff they have going on.

Are you really willing to risk your job for a few cents a day?

Mining is not feasible on anything short of an ASIC at the moment. This ASIC would eat up a ton of power, put off alot of heat and noise, and require network connectivity. If you were somehow able to avoid these three things from being noticed you would still be risking your job for approximately 3 bucks a day with an ASIC such as the antminer S3. Its not worth it and most likely not legal.
