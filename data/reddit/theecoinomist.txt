It sure is looking dark right now. But I will be the guy to say it.
MountGox was a shitty and amateurish exchange that was not to be trusted.
When I got into bitcoin, I learned 2 rules. 2 RULES!
1. Only store online what you can afford to lose
2. Avoid MtGox at all means
MtGox has repeatedly proven stupid, but I guess people don't learn unless it's the hard way. So... **this is actually a good thing!**

Also, bitcoin will not make a breakthrough in day-to-day transactions first (altho it's incredibly easy to bank with your friends if they know how to as well), the big thing will be the remmitance market, and slowly penetrate the market for international transfer.

I might have been exaggerating, but if you are earning above $150k, you pay in the range of 80-85% to the country.
66% top income bracket (above $50k),
+8% in "work tax".
Add 25% sales tax on everything, + 180% on cars and cigarettes. Then add another 120% on gas, and to top it off we decided in 2012 to tax products that contain fat or sugar.

The number of transactions on this black friday increased by 5000% compared to last year, as did the price. So I have to disagree with you on that Sir..

Apps that facilitate payments like Gli.ph are not allowed, [Coinbase]( (and Blockchain.info) has also felt the wraith of Apple previously..

They would have to work for them, most likely by selling stuff or freelancing.
You basically just need product or an internet connection.
By using a payment processor like Bitpay you will pay like 1% fee (if you don't op for a fixed price), which is still lower than credit cards. I could imagine you get some form of recurring income as well, if you're customers were to pay in bitcoins you could shave that fee as well.

Bookmark wallet site or paste it in a document, be it on your harddrive or in the cloud..
I also made offline documents with adresses, usernames and passwords connected to bitcoins which makes it a little easier.. (made this offline on a secondary computer)

I think there are a few services which lets you send bitcoins through sms as well. I wouldn't consider it to be a luxury, seeing access to cheap smart phones are surprisingly high even in poor countries.. but yea, it probably won't be the baby boomers adopting btc

They linked to it through said icon on their webpage cause they had an actual story on bitcoin, if you look on their page today you can see a different icon linking to a different article..

[Strongcoin]( is the best alternative for a hybrid web wallet, when that is said, Armory or paper wallets are to be prefered.

"Pricing like it should be
Stripe charges 2.9% + 30¢ per successful charge, or less based on volume."
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:39:29
It will be 10 if measured in cents though

Not every exchange, there is [this one]( located in the unknown city of Bulgaria..

5. US based exchanges amounts to 2% of global volume. I see a bright future for bitcoin, with or without coinbase.

There are no exchanges in Denmark as it isn't allowed to hold other peoples money unless you are a financial institution. If a dane wants to buy bitcoins he/she has to pay outrageous fees on bitcoinnordic (5% + $6) or go the Bitstamp route

The same way Satoshi is sitting on $500 million in bitcoins.. If they appreciate and you mined a few hundred thousands in the currencys first week you might come out great, unless that currency dies off before
