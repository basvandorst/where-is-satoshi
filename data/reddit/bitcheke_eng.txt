I think it's both. From one hand, people are really moving to other alts. BTC domination was 50% or something like this in the early autumn, now it's 39%. Though I remember it was 32% a couple of months ago. People are moving back to BTC. BTC  is top, market is very dependent on BTC. Every dip starts with BTC and other coins crash harder.

There are no chances to completely shut down the crypto. Governments should understand it. The more strikes we get, the more powerful we become.

It is definitely good news.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:34:05
Good news.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:10:09
And why do you think so?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:25:28
Wow, Bitfinex outperformed Coinbase in this! Way to go. Hope more exchanges will follow the suit

It is pretty bad investment :(
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:12:35
Of course they fear. They don't us to be free. They don't want us to control our hard earned money. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:06:54
Look at Binance, Kucoin, Kraken.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:53:25
Yes, it can't be undisputed, since blockchain is irreversible.

Yes, he has done a lot for the space. If it wasn't him, I can't imagine Bitcoin and crypto so popular now. He is working hard trying to pass the technology on people.

Eventually they have said that they such diligently and long tried to hide.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:15:34
But, do you know that fact, that there is no proof also about security of Tether assets?
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:24:41
Okay, i understood your point of view.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:45:21
Well done!
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:56:44
It is obviously. First of all, developers must solve the problem of scalability.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:58:20
They are starting to understand it, eventually.
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:48:04
Lol, that was very good
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:50:09
Yes, of course. We are on the beginning stage. On the genesis stage only, genesis of something bigger.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:09:54
Exactly what I thought. What if we see $20 fees again or even higher? Moving to segwit can save you money in the future
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:30:06
Maybe, he is Monero millionaire already:)
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:16:12
Hardwallet, like Trezor or Ledger, or paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:29:59
Eventually. Great times ahead for BTC!

The most funny were, when Ver tried to prove, that BCH is the original one. It is a non-sense.
