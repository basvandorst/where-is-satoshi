False accusation? Everything is in Internet. No it is all true. You formed a fake company in Delaware to hide everything. Used this shadow company to open bank account in HSBC Hong Kong. Also used it in France. France discovered your fraud and you was kicked. 


I'm not complaining. I disclosed you have stole my bitcoins and I disclosed you committed fraud against HSBC Hong Kong and France Banks.


Sorry I do not agree to have my documents sold in the back market.
**Everything I said is true. You have no way to say Mutum is not a fraud because it really is.**
You have used this fraud with HSBC Hong Kong and you have used the Mutum fraud in France.
Mark Karpeless use fake id, fake proof of address, to open bank accounts worldwide. This is a shadow company.
You are an International Internet criminal who is getting rich with your scam game.
Why are you hiding everything from everyone (including tax authorities) but you want me to disclose all my information to you? Ah, I remember... you want to sell my information in the black market.
Mtgox is scam pretending to be exchanger. KK Tibanne is fake. Mutum LLC is fraud.

Ask **GBG_MtGox** why they are hiding everything. Ask what company owns the HSBC bank account used by MtGox for international bank wire fraud.
MtGox made the same fraud in France but they where kicked.
Mark Karpeles is commiting fraud in the USA with Dwolla. The MtGox Dwolla account is also fake. Mtgox is using Mutum Sigillum fraudulent address.
**Google it!**

HSBC Hong Kong was used by Mtgox to commit International bank wire fraud with Mutum Sigillum LLC, a Delaware company with fake USA Address that Mark Karperless is the hidden beneficiary.

They pretend to be a service provider. They have no authority over me to demand anything. I do not agree to send my documents to internet criminals. Why they don't send my bitcoins back if they do not agree to make business with me?
Mtgox is a scam, Internet fraud. They use Google advertisement to scam newbies. I have joined it after followed a google advertisement and some more clicks.
I will report them to google adwords.

YOU ARE A FRAUD.

If I was scammed by MtGox? Yes. How many bitcoins? 10 BTC. I'm a drug dealer? No, but you are an idiot supporting fraud and scam.
I'm fighting back disclosing a gangster shadow business.

I have reported MtGox to HSBC Hong Kong for Internet fraud.

Mtgox is a scam pretending to be bitcoin exchanger. Period. They stole my bitcoins. I'm not the one only that they stole. Everyone know they are selective scammers.
I will not get my bitcoins back but I will fightback in guerrilla style.
MtGox will be the next scam defunct now that Bitcoin-central is psp.
Don't use Mtgox it's pure ripoff.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:22:32
You are a scammer pretending to be a bitcoin exchanger. You planned your scam game to accept bitcoin from everyone before any document is uploaded. This is not normal business this is scam game.
I choose to not send my documents because I care for my life and my family life. I do not live in an free country. It is a big risk for my privacy because you are not a legit company. A legit company ask for documents before receiving any money and do not partnership with pirate companies.
You choose to stole my bitcoins. This make you a criminal no me. It is karma.
You are laundering money in Hong Kong, Cyprus and Tortola to avoid Japan sanctions. Be sure Hong Kong and Japanese authorities will be notified. You will be kicked from Hong Kong like you was from France for fraud.

mtgox is a bunch of selective scammers. Stupid scammers. GBG_MtGox is a thief.

Read this post [Mtgox blocked my account after received my Bitcoins!](
I have made a complaint to HSBC Hong-Kong where MtGox has bank accounts.
I have contacted a friend who are an authorized MoneyGram agent. We talked a lot about Internet scam sites, gambling, bitcoin, etc. I told him what happened. In the end he told me "we also reserve the right to refuse to process any transaction for any reason. I will learn more about this site".
I still have not received my bitcoins back. I don't believe they will send it back.
I'm not alone. This is mtgox karma ---&gt; The yesterday's victory opens the door to the tomorrow's defeat.

[MtGox is a scam, read this](
KK Tibane and Mtgox are using HSBC Hong Kong to hide clients scammed money.

You are a fraud. Remember you stole my bitcoins. You are a thief!

Dwolla and HSBC Hong Kong was used by Mtgox to commit International bank wire fraud with Mutum Sigillum LLC. Mtgox was banned from France for Bank wire fraud.
@_date: 2012-12-14 22:01:19
No. I have to say Mtgox.com has no license to operate exchanger business in Japan.
@_date: 2012-12-14 19:23:05
No, I was a newbie. You are an idiot because you deserve to be scammed uploading documents to all internet sites.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:39:30
Gone or MtGox is a little more rich now? What they do with the bitcoins they stole from me?
@_date: 2012-12-13 13:01:54
They formed a Delaware company Mutum Sigillum LLC to try to make DWOLA account legit. This LLC is using someone's house address. It is fake. Mutum is not related to financial activities.
MtGox used this LLC to open bank account with HSBC Hong Kong for money laundering and hide cash from Japanese authorities.
MtGox used this Mutum LLC to open bank accounts. This is why they was kicked from France.
Tibanne address in Japan is also fake.
