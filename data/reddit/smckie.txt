Point is to force people to learn how to shop with Bitcoin! You're free to add additional Bitcoin if you want and buy a higher priced item. We can't just give it away all willy nilly now :)

Investor(user) returns are generated from sales (endorsement) of a product (the content). Thanks for providing me all the fodder I need to explain the specifics to reduce confusion.

Oh, and please follow Yours on Twitter  You can follow the engineering team as well  More explainers to come!

DATT (backend system) is open source and on github just look up 'ryanxcharles'. The new Yours code is currently on a private repo until mainnet launch (mid May) at earliest I believe. Just got to get things 100% first. Don't need nice folks losing money. Also disclaimer, the system will not be fully decentralized in Yours until that portion of the codebase is complete in DATT. Baby steps. Join the slack and you can help us make content great again, faster!
@_date: 2016-04-13 20:33:51
Not in the slightest! Taking a whole diff approach. Only similarity is people are getting paid for providing content. And pss: follow us on Twitter 
@_date: 2016-04-13 06:46:56
Haha. No no. I'm more so keen on the 'affiliate marketing' comparison. That parallels what we're seeking to do in the longterm. But, for the MVP (min viable prod.) launch (mid-May hopefully, yay!) we are keeping scope small to get these key components perfect first. 
We are looking to use payment channels/Bitcoin and p2p to do something really sweet that incentivizes endorsing content with micropayments. 
How that expands in the future will be at the discretion of the users who adopt the platform. And whatever Ryan, myself, and everyone else in the Slack can come up with. (Psst: DATT-Slackin.herokuapp.com to join us).

I invite you to wait until further information and details are released on how the endorsements payout individuals (thats the next post, be on lookout) before trying to negatively smudge the product, when it hasn't even been released yet.

Loosen up. Read some of other posts about Yours as well:  Follow the engineering blog ( for more "by the book" explanations. This is a platform for a general consumer audience. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:05:23
Yours is not a news site/publication. It's a p2p platform for ALL kinds of content. News is just one type of content that can be found on the web. Art, music, videos, written works - anything can be shared. The p2p nature of Yours keeps the platform distributed, and unable to be censored (once decentralized storage is implemented, beyond scope of the preview soft launch we're doing for testing). Your concerns are very sound though; and the additional perspective is appreciated greatly as we build this. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:27:43

Coinbase is a U.S BANKING regulated entity. BANK. BANK. How many times must people tell you? They have to ask you those questions or they can't be a BANK. Just buy your bitcoins and moved them to a secure wallet outside of coinbase. If you don't know how you should learn.

Grandpa. You know how banks have filing cabinets with their ledgers? The block sizes (the Bitcoin filing cabinets) grow and shrink depending on how theyre being used. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:01:34
Based on the average block sizes of previous blocks, rewards and the max block size will adjust accordingly. Allowing for a more scaleable transactional volume that is more balanced for large and small scale miners. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:30:18

On their platform you would convert your bitgold value to USD/major fiat or BTC depending on the current exchange rate. And as Bitreserve is BTC in and BTC out you would remove your value in BTC via the blockchain.

@_date: 2014-12-09 04:26:46
Id try out Bitreserve.org. It'll allow you to store your BTC, and if the price seems like it's gonna dip you can convert your BTC directly to USD or other major fiat to hold its value. Great for a student living on a fixed budget. You can then convert back to BTC when the price is back where you're comfortable, or just spend as USD and they'll auto convert to BTC. It'll offer you the greatest access to your funds in case of emergency, and protects your investment.

There is no source currently because the project is in Beta and the developer has worked solely on this alone for months and wishes to get it working perfectly and getting adoption for open source is pushed out. The GUI doesn't matter, no diff than Bitcoin QT for the time being. V 1.0 is important for functionality. Looks can come later. Thats not the point. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 21:05:46
Make sure to have him highlight the incentives for why to use it over traditional fiat. Also. To express the long term implications of using Blockchain tech. Those are the things people need to hear most.

I don't think it's creates any credibility issues with anyone. Using an established entity to deal gold in such an innovative way was a smart move. There is large notoriety and trust there, which why I'm sure they opted to work with them. And, gold is just only one service they offer. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:01:14
Hello! Steven from Bitreserve here. Love your enthusiasm for the platform. Glad you're happy about your investment with us! It's always best to only invest as much as you can afford! I think by maintaining a diversity in your investment you give your wallet more room to grow. It's entirely up to you! But I too feel what we are doing is seriously going to alter the landscape. Simplicity and removal of volatility does a lot to help the average joe get into Bitcoin and other cloud based commodities (Bitoil,Bitgold) -- so I firmly believe our platform will aid in user adoption. We've been running since the end of October and have already surpassed $2mill+ in transactions! It's been awesome. 
Hope to see more excited posts like these.

Well his opinion is unpopular...
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:50:14
Agreed. A merchant service like BitPay and Coinbase wouldn't be complete if they weren't doing their part to not only contract new merchants to use their service -- but also teaching that merchants potential customers what Bitcoin is in order to make the ecosystem flourish. Acceptance is only step one and BitPay/Coinbase have a fiduciary interest to educate as many as possible.
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:57:35
I think the point is to allow maximum utility; whether it's transferring from one fiat currency to another, using Bitcoin as the middleman to make it all very cheap is good move.

@_date: 2014-12-04 16:16:10
Yes precisely! I think many will make that misconnection and not realize only banks that are the one paying into the FDIC are the ones getting those protections. The layman doesn't know this. And, I'd hate for them to think they will be protected from their purchases if they buy something on say eBay using their Coinbase/Circle/ etc account, and then want to get a transaction refunded for a good purchased.
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:44:23
OMFG. HAHAHAHA 
@_date: 2014-11-20 03:15:29
Bitreserve is a great site for day traders too! Great way to keep your funds safe by converting it to other fiat currencies, which are held at that value. From there you can convert back to Bitcoin at whatever the current exchange rate. Great for keeping your funds safe from volatility (like over Thanksgiving holiday ;) )
Also Bitreserves fee is only .45%

Because the functionality needs to be tested fully and in the real working environment. It is beta so there are bound to be bugs, which is the risk in a beta. No big deal. Throwing a couple cents around on the client to test it out won't hurt anyone.

Giving the consumer options of course. Why not? Gold is still a valuable asset to many people, not everyone is caught into the 100% bitcoin craze, yet. So, why not diversify your offerings? Sounds like a great way to fuel adoption to me.

If people want to send funds from multiple currencies around the world, they should consider Bitreserve.org as they allow you to hold your BTC in a myriad of fiat currencies, and allow quick conversions back to BTC -- and you can email your funds. How cool is that? And it's free and simple to use. Services like Bitreserve, Coinbase, and Circle are going to ultimately steal all of WU market share.

Let me add a bit of clarity as I'm seeing this question a lot. I don't work for Coinbase, but I do work for a Bitcoin company. Let me tell you it is very difficult/convoluted process for every Bitcoin startup and service (regardless how large) to get license to do business in every state. 
Most states (like my humble home here in VA) are very selective of who they permit to do business as a financial body handling transactions. They will open business in a state as soon as it's simple and or the barrier to entry is simplified with more regulation/financial reform. Patience! It's hard to dot every I and cross every T when regs are still being written. 
Just my two cents.

What has BlackCoin community ever done to scam anyone? Nothing.  You've no reason to tarnish the name. Go troll elsewhere. BLK is in the same league as namecoin, Peercoin,dogecoin. Take a look at the BlackCoin git for proof. I'm done for now. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:56:51
Bitstamp doesn't run on a fractional reserve, comparing it to the FDIC doesn't make much sense. Perhaps just a typical insurance underwriter  has their hot wallet insured.

Airbitz is making it? Nice. I'd suggest taking cues from Circle. Simple. Refined. Everything where it needs to be, and all the bells and whistles. What I mean is make use of widgets, and notifications center integration(iOS). Make sure to support PIN access or TouchID/equiv. And for goodness sake make it super light so it flys on any android device/Apple iPhone gen. Also. Make the user feel welcomed. ITS THEIR MONEY FOR ONCE! They got control now. Boot up app from cold launch maybe something like: "Welcome Back *Name Here*" then possibly a gravatar photo of the user. Perhaps a way to view the recent price charts right from your wallet too. And make sure I can assign photos to people's public addresses in my contacts. Much easier than finding names.

@_date: 2017-02-11 03:37:55
Of course. Always makes sense to run things concurrently and ensure all is well. But overtime, the plan is to make that unnecessary. Bcoin can work standalone with no issues, to think you must always need a concurrent bitcoind instance forever would be silly, and defeat the purpose of multiple working implementations. :)

@_date: 2015-01-24 19:39:44
As a contractor for Bitreserve I can personally attest to the innovation and added utility they are trying to bring to digital currencies like Bitcoin. They've got a very LT and secure plan to bring Bitcoin to the masses, all while lessening the chance of monetary loss by allowing you to convert your BTC balance to fiat in times of price downturn. 
What you are capable of doing with Bitreserve will only continue to grow more as orgs utilize their API and they roll out additional features. 
Bitreserve has done a lot in its short lifespan. I personally use their site to store my funds (My GF too)
Great write up @_date: 2015-01-12 21:04:47

I read the whole article just waiting to be offended at some point. Nope. It was a great read with a lot of interesting facts, especially in regards to African Americans avoiding Bitcoin due to the highly white libertarian counter culture. I think the latter has calmed down a lot lately, however. 
Curious anyone else's opinion
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:44:40
If you want to hold USD you can transfer Bitcoin to your Bitreserve.org account. There you can convert your BTC to the current USD equivalent and that value remains stagnant and does not change with volatility. Bitreserve employs a Proof Of Reserve system and are wholly transparent, as well as holding an audit of their fiat reserve every 90days. 
Worth a shot!

I suggest everyone listen to the interview. It's a wealth of information and Balaji is extremely keen on what work needs to be done to continue growing bitcoin.

The presses purposes here is to ensure as many individuals are informed about this proposal as possible. Now, the project and its initiative will get far more saturation; ensuring this solution with sound technical merit gets plenty of scrutiny. We look forward to your feedback on the proposal/spec.

We're currently testing the integration of bcoin directly into Purse's wallet. Once we've tested it accordingly will move to the next phase which is integrating bcoin for all user funds. Then we can do a lot more cool things with our wallets, and offer other privacy improvements for our users. 
It would be excellent if those companies currently running their own flavor of bitcoinj gave bcoin a go. I see nothing stopping them from running their current implementation and bcoin concurrently and see how it fairs for them. 
Purse will be giving a talk tomorrow regarding bcoin here in SF that I'm sure will likely be recorded and JJ will be teaching everyone a lot of great info about bcoin that should be good for nudging folks to give it go.

Nope that's literally it. And, their api is used for other Bitcoin related businesses. They'll soon become a broker like coinbase. And inevitable merchant support.

Steve. I told you to clean this up. I warned you about Paycoin a long time ago via Twitter. And I stated earlier: make an announcement apologizing for accepting Paycoin or the people gonna get ya!

Not surprised by any of this. I'm surprised the foundation isn't strictly volunteer basis anyways with tasks decentralized by those who wish to commit their expertise to Bitcoins growth. 
Glad the air is cleared and this is out in the open. It'll make for some interesting articles.

As a recent transplant to SF I too was saddened by the Bitcoin presence, or lack there of. I'm assuming you are squared away now. But if you need anything else let me know, I stay in SOMA. Bitcoiners stick together!
And it's always great to see someone fully utilize BTC. Great story and your English is better than you think!

The foundation has banked in its "rep" and business dealings far too long. The status and regard that the foundation receives is wholly underserved (sans core dev and select extreme evangelist). 
Will be interesting to see this play out. I've got my popcorn.

Bcoin, the fullnode, is being used as the backend wallet database for Purse wallets and handling all payments. Nothing is changing functionally, only difference is we've migrated from other fullnode implementations to our own unique one. Of which, is browserfiable, if you wish to implement it that way. If you want to learn more about bcoin and how it works, check out the docs:  and check out our Medium post,

I believe it's an issue with lack of hardcore bitcoiners on the founding team (I can attest to this, I worked there a short time) - and a bad alignment with marketing and the leading investors. They wanted to create an "Internet of Value/Money/etc", hiding Bitcoin as the rails in the foreground opting to attempt to become a "reserve" - issuing various cloud based money's as assets to users in their "internal money cloud". It probably spoke well to investors and with the rebranding they probably had some new hire coming in to align the marketing more with the shift and this is where the various miscommunications come. And, all respect to Anthony Watson and Halsey; but they don't strike me as hardcore engineering and types and probably don't fully understand the range of capabilities Bitcoin possesses- therefore when they speak publicly it sounds all mashed up. It's a mix of lack of full technical understanding on Halsey and Anthony's end; and a lack of meaningful marketing that focuses on Bitcoin's true ethos.

You order from Amazon.mx, and your item ships from Amazon as would any other order. Or you can used Purse's USendHome native drop shipping integration and have your order shipped to a US shipping forwarder and sent to your home anywhere. Check out the support page at  to learn more.

They still aren't saying Bitcoin is bad. They're just saying they can be the centralized authority that Bitcoin isn't (just like Coinbase is a centralized authority,but said in a very confusing rhetoric). They're all just following a different narrative but ultimately all doing the same thing.

Yes. According to coinmap. Thank you Kyle. I've been to plenty of those places and most don't support it anymore or those businesses have closed.

Hey guys, McKie from Purse here. Seems you're having a delay. If your transaction is still pending, contact us at support and we can look into it. 
We'll be changing over our backend wallet system here soon, which should help with ensuring these sorts of occurrences don't affect customers as much during periods of heavy network congestion. 
Your Satoshi's are safe, no worries :). These things happen. We have your back though!

Very excited for your work, Peter. I am particularly perturbed that others are relying on tokens as the under rails of a new system - and I believe whole heartedly in using the Bitcoin BlockChain 100% instead of creating additional TTP, even if it's Factom.

I think a public apology and a major rethink as to how they market themselves is in order, or else face the possibility of alienating their highly finite/fragile customer base. Its next to impossible to become a successful Bitcoin startup *without* the backing of the Bitcoin community.

This is upsetting I've been so confused on their Bitcoin rhetoric for so long. I personally have worked *for* Bitreserve writing copy, and it's so difficult to write about Bitcoin for them as they do not want to put major emphasis on bitcoin itself, they moreso want to focus on the aspect of "cloud-based value". 
Hopefully they'll try to employ the advice and expertise of those highly educated on the space and the topic so as to not offend anyone else -- this could have been easily avoided if someone would have just proofread this prior, they could have saw the possibility of confusion/cringeworthy wording.
I'm a PM/Email away Bitreserve. Let's prevent this from happening again.
