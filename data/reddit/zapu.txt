You don't need to go great lengths to "claim" your reddit gold. Also you don't need to include it in your tax forms, which is less or more convenient depending on country you are in.
Value-wise, I'm unsure which is better, few dollars you can't or don't know how to use (still, depending on country - if you were to exchange them to local currency; or spend in businesses that takes bitcoins); or a month of perks on a website you are a regular on.
Just to be clear, I'm a bitcoin supporter, but I don't find bitcoin tips to non-bitcoiners a particularly great idea. In my eyes, they are similar to how people gift bitcoins to their relatives on Christmas, or when they leave bitcoin paperwallets as a tip in restaurant.

If I was looking for you, knowing that you have a dog with a fever would narrow down things a bit ;-)

AFAIR, it doesn't give you privacy, people operating end nodes can sniff your traffic.

Someone will start archiving blockchain on "traditional" media like ink and paper. Then, after everything goes out, people will be able to switch to other currency for time being by converting their BTC using the archived blockchain as reference.

Can someone come up with a scenario of mining pool abusing 51%+ hash power? I'd like to know how exactly can a pool create double spends for example. Thanks!

And you actually had to get your ass down there and work with that shovel.

So he (they?) had about a day to fix and didn't do it? Cute.

Thanks for the explaination. In the meantime, I've found that [wiki]( also explains this pretty well, I'm not sure why I haven't found this before. So all this relies on mining your private fork.

What's the danger of pool reaching 51% of share? Wouldn't it have to force all its miners to alter the client to be able to fork the chain?

A lot of internet bookmakers already support betting on esport matches.
