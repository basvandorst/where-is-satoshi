tbh, we should start holding corporations to criminal standards, not just the people running them. plausible deniability is too easy to achieve. fines, jail time for anyone involved (incl those following orders), right up to forcible liquidation for heinous crimes.
corporations are meant to outgrow and outlive us, not shield us from prosecution.

to be fair to Ted Stevens, while the rest of his ramblings were clueless, the internet as a series of tubes isn't the worst analogy ever.

Seriously. The world has been watching this country fall apart for years now. Whether in a free and fair election or removed by his own people, Madura was very obviously on his way out long before any of this.
And besides:


american approval is the geopolitical equivalent of "share if you agree" at this point. if anyone is "installing" him, it's the elected national assembly in venezuela. as in, *the fucking people*.

I've been seeing a bunch of this pro Maduro / anti US stuff all over Reddit today. Smells like propaganda.

Coinsquare has treated me well. They take Interac Email transfers, wires, some cards, and others. Not the cheapest by any stretch tho.

I suspect this is easier said than done.

I guess it depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you want to go?
Explaining a basic electrical circuit to someone could be a lot more difficult than wiring that basic circuit if you have to get into the fundamentals of electricity or the engineering behind lightbulbs and batteries.

actually a motorized bobblehead that has its bobbing speed tied to BTC price volatility would be fun

Unless you can make formal verification easy, this won't be a revolution. it's simply not scalable.
