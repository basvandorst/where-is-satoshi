I doubt enough people would be willing to pay a monthly fee. You're best option would probably be a small fee per transaction with an option for a "premium" account that costs a monthly fee instead of a per transaction fee.

Most will have the same problems. Iota looks promising, but we'll have to see how well it holds up after more adoption.

To be fair, some do, but that wasn't my point. The price relative to the dollar didn't increase due to fiat inflating or Bitcoin deflating. It increased due to increased demand. It doesn't really matter all that much. I just find it odd that people are calling this proof of why deflation is good when this is as simple as increased demand for a good.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:12:59
That's the definition of speculation. You buy something with the expectation of its value increasing for some reason. Deflation would be destroying some Bitcoin reducing the total supply without affecting the total value thus increasing the value per Bitcoin

The increased value isn't because of deflation though. It's because of speculation.

I want to point out that this isn't all cops. Yes, this is an important distinction. If all cops are hated, it becomes an us vs. them mentality and just furthers the military-like enemy mentality that police have been moving towards in regard to the public. This needs to become taboo among cops and those who actively stand up against it should be encouraged. This us vs. them mentality is the same thing that has prevented progress on race and gender. Giving in to generalizing all police officers just pushes away the good ones and ends up radicalizing and giving more power to the bad ones.

But if a cop is a genuinely good person trying to do the right thing and knows that exposing corruption will get him fired or arrested or worse, then maybe the best he can do is to just continue to do his best to make up for the bad ones. I don't think that's a lack of conscience.

So it's better to give up than to try to make a difference? There are always going to be enough people to fill the position. If all of the less shitty ones quit, how do you expect anything to improve?

I got downvoted for the same reason I've been downvoted throughout the whole thread. People dont follow reddiquette and don't agree with me. Most of my posts have just been pointing out obvious flaws with arguments and asking for clarification. I guess people don't like their viewpoint to be challenged.
Thanks actually answering my question. I'll look into that.

And if a cop doesn't steal from people and acts fairly and tries to help the community, why would you want him to quit to be replaced by someone who will steal from people and beat people and shit? He might not be able to reverse the damage that others do, but by not being shitty and staying in his position, he is saving every person he interacts with from having to deal with a shitty cop. Saying "no one with a conscience should be a cop" will result in the same thing as saying "cops shouldn't have a conscience" so you are basically agreeing with the corrupt individuals that cops should all be completely immoral.

If being a cop makes you part of a corrupt organization, then how would one remain a cop yet resign from a corrupt organization?
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:52:50
What are you talking about? I didn't say people shouldn't protest against shitty actions. I'm saying don't make broad generalizations about a large group of people (some of whom are genuinely good people) and actively promote murder in the name of justice like some people in this thread are doing.

Yes and no. It's really just a lagging indicator of increased interest in Bitcoin. You can make it into pretty much anything you want by including other data and applying your own logic and ideology, but on its own, it only says that there was a recent uptick in interest which we already knew. The only really interesting part is seeing exactly where the interest is coming from.

So if a Nazi has the choice of keeping his head down and trying to save as many people from the gas chambers as he can or try to fight the system and end up on the other side of the fence, you think he shouldn't try to help people? What kind of logic is that?
@_date: 2016-09-28 21:35:22
Pretty sure he was referencing [this article](

More likely that they're trying to cash out, but selling in high volume pushes the price down so they make a lot of smaller dumps to keep the price somewhat high

If something like this is implemented, I would much prefer to use either the Alternative Vote system or STV or a preference voting system used in order to better represent the community's opinion.

Bitcoin being used for drugs was Bitcoin being used exactly how it was intended, storing and transferring value. Did you even read the article?

Wasn't the fork by definition a lack of faith in the devs?
