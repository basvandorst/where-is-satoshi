Do they have a working search function yet? And do you still have to be online for your items to show up? Tried it out a few years ago and at that time it was logistically unusable.

Another way you can tell it's still early is Bitcoin  is polling behind "None" lol

The problem with surveys is that they are often not representative of the entire population. For example, you could ask 1000 Americans if they  watch Netflix. But if you hold the survey in a Stranger Things forum, you're going to get different results than if you asked the question in a forum about shoes.

Look on Coinbase Pro. You can see the order book and figure it out exactly. But $100,000 is nothing.

I'm at 8 blocks since sending without a confirmation.
Edit: Ended up with transaction confirmation email at 10:47 EDT, 4 hours and 21 minutes later, that they actually posted the transaction. It was confirmed in the next block. This delay ended up hurting me quite a bit.

Something kind of similar happened to me as a kid. I had maybe $1000 worth of mint silver coins. A "friend" broke into my house while I was at school and stole them. I had no idea, but my mom knew it was him immediately. Looking back, it was probably pretty obvious. He was a bad kid, was always skipping school, and was a stupid thief. Took my Xbox too but didn't go in anyone else's room. Didn't even take $100 sitting on the kitchen table. And he left a perfect shoeprint in the mud outside the window. 
He ended up ripping all these mint coins out of their holders and just buried them in the dirt, ruining their value. The police said a few kids had broken into multiple houses and were burying all their loot like pirates. It worked out for me though. My "friend's" mom came over with him and made him apologize and beg not to press charges. She offered me the value of the ruined things. I charged her full retail value and then went and rebought them for half that on eBay.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:24:26
I don't feel that's the case. She said print out a list of the values and I'll pay you that amount so my kid doesn't go to jail. I found a legitimate source and did so.  It was a business transaction. I wasn't going to give her a discount. Furthermore, I didn't have to rebuy all the items. I could have kept the cash. But I liked my little collection so I took the time to find the best deals to buy them back.  Half the price is probably hyperbole. This was 15 years ago so I don't remember exact numbers.
But if people disagree, that's ok too.

With a self-directed IRA you can manually buy the asset directly. This is mildly complicated but is possible to do. Alternatively, there are sites like bitcoinira.com. I have never used nor endorse this site, but it is an example.

Expert may be a bit overstated haha but I know what you meant.  I agree with your moral analysis. Though I stand by the decision I made, I was also ~12 and pissed off. 
@_date: 2019-11-20 18:48:13
I have no idea. I imagine very few. But my point is it's not due to waiting on the regulators to allow it. It's already allowed and being done.

I can't even begin to feel bad for anyone if they're victimized by USDT. The community has been saying avoid Tether for well over a year. At this point it's wilful ignorance or a risk they choose to take.

My question is who is on the other side of the trade dumping Bitcoin for bolivars?
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:26:42
In the Daily USD Value of Bitcoin Sent chart, it's much higher volume moving into the all-time high and then starts to go down with the price. Though not proof, I would think if we were seeing the same amount of Bitcoin usage (not counting sends to/from exchange), that number would trend slowly upward indiscriminate of price.
But then again, that was assuming those numbers are (bitcoins sent x current USD value) rather than (bitcoins sent x USD value on the day sent) which I suppose may not be the case.
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:12:25
That's down from 2017 which I find disappointing. That graph suggests it's mostly just in and out of exchanges sadly.
@_date: 2019-01-25 07:53:32
Would be way better if current machines upgraded their software to include Bitcoin like coinstar is doing.

Do I understand correctly that you have 9 out of the 12 words?

I also have no transaction history from btc-e so I have absolutely no proof now of trades from those old 2013-2014? days. I have so many sends, half of which were transfers to exchanges/wallets, some back and forth to gambling sites, some payments to friends. Why would I keep track of this stuff back when it was just fun money? While I'm not worried about possible taxes from old years because they'd be offset by standard deductions because I didn't have a job, I have absolutely no way to calculate my cost basis on current coins. I just have way too many transactions that I have no idea what they are (Was this a sell? Was it a transfer? Where did these coins come from? Did I buy from a stranger or just a transfer from a different site? Etc.)
What I did in the end just a few days ago was the best I can do at this point. Assume I was FIFOing and go back and see what my last known x purchases were and use that as my cost basis for the current x coins I own now so at least I'm pretty close moving forward.

I don't see any mention of vaults or multi-sig vaults. How will those be affected?
@_date: 2019-01-27 06:00:55
This can mean relative stability. If you had something that moved by a max of 10% or 20% in a year, that would be stable compared to the 10x runs. Now 2 and 3 are not mutually exclusive.
