Circle works pretty quickly. It's taboo to mention here, but a little place called coinbase.com is equally easy. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:40:22
Many of them also have valid concerns.
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:06:44
You can't even tell what software they are running. You're just judging a logo. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:39:25
It doesn't make any sense for retailers unless they really like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:43:44
Doesn't supporting developers besides core also attract hate? Zero sum game
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:40:45
Because it's high quality and beautiful. 
@_date: 2016-04-30 20:48:29
I've used both but generally recommend coinbase. Use that referral code to make bitcoin a bit cheaper for you and your friend. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 22:55:30
That's what you should do. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 22:51:55
I had no idea Gavin was so pro Blockstream. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 05:14:42
I'm personally not convinced that a shortage of space on blocks is necessarily bad. But I'm 100% against censoring discussion of XT. Especially considering running XT doesn't mean an automatic fork, it waits for a supermajority. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:25:45
Citation for coinbase being down 3mil/month? 
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:18:09
Do you defend this censorship, ywecur? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 05:31:30
About what? Censoring coinbase? Not according to github. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:28:18
XT is not a centralizing hardfork. It doesn't even activate till 75% supermajority. Running it right now is merely a vote. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 07:09:19
8 years of my life, duh
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:58:53
R/Bitcoin is one of the most heavily censored subreddits. Are you kidding? 
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:23:57
That's funny, because my shill account is older than bitcoin is. Unlike yours. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:19:56
That's what the other side says about their camp too. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:24:00
Vitalik is smarter, though. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:17:07
Making the easiest way to exchange cash for bitcoin?? Are you kidding?
 Remember in 2013 when seemingly every month there was some big new company like dell or Newegg or Microsoft that was accepting Bitcoin? That was largely pushed by coinbase. And now those same companies are backing off because apparently bitcoin isn't Internet cash, but rigged to be a "settlement layer." I tried to buy an airline ticket the other day, but Expedia doesn't take bitcoin anymore. There's more to making bitcoin work than just being a tech nerd. As far as incentives go, I trust coinbase, not blockstream, to look after the future of bitcoin. And now this forum is so jacked, it's 50/50 this message will be censored. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 09:37:07
There's also the fact that a lot of core politics have been bullshit. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:30:46
Wasn't aware. Please elaborate the logic behind that. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 12:48:20
And a lot of the stuff he says is still correct. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:27:07
2017 Gavin is pretty great too. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:04:02
Toxic inflammatory posts like this are a big problem with the community. Classic has very real and good reasons for existing. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:59:25
Core is the Centralized corruptible coin. Don't confuse yourself. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:06:14
Pretty glad Gavin is looking after Satoshi's vision. Even if someone else had the courage, they'd lack the ethos. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:26:16
If you were being censored, nobody could watch you be a crybaby. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:29:25
Talking about hardforks? Because it's something we need to see happen. Better sooner than later. Unless you think a hardfork should never happen. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:10:14
Andersen and Garzik are anything but unknown. Gavin was once the leader of core before deciding he didn't want control. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:11:27
Better hard fork now than later. Unless the suggestion is that there should never be a hardfork which is outrageous. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:05:39
I trust Brian Armstrong much more than blockstream funded core Devs as far as the goal of making bitcoin an 'electronic cash' goes. Stop flinging poo everywhere 
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:26:51
Now I'm extra confused. The data centers in China are less centralized? DDOS immune AWS nodes paid for by people sick of their home Internet getting jammed doesn't help decentralization? What about people voting with their money and feet make them 'carcinogen nodes'? 
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:22:10
Nobody is saying we shouldn't look for off-chain scaling solutions. But this arbitrary 1mb limit is outrageous, and there's nothing so dangerous about a fork, contrary to popularly pushed sentiment in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 05:02:22
The same reason builders sell units as condos instead of charging rent long term. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:07:23
Does that count as artificial? 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:13:49
There's nothing good about the 1mb arbitrary block size. You're not rooting for the right team. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:05:56
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:35:21
90% might be true, not really concerned. But downvotes are not censorship. Guarantee more people see bottom point comments than new comments. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:44:23
Like KNCminer ceo said, Core could end this whole debacle right now by hardforking to 2mb. Still see no good reason why that hasn't happened. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:14:51
On the contrary, that's exactly what core Devs would need to do to knock the wind right out of classic. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:17:30
Mike Hearn is basically bitcoin Jesus. He sacrificed himself to save us all. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:46:16
Not impressed with core. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 08:16:47
Still tends to centralize around locations of cheap electricity. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:17:38
Hardly unknown. Some of the original bitcoin Devs that were in communication with Satoshi. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:09:50
If shitshows bothered you, you wouldn't be on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:07:34
As if Core Devs have offered any reasonable long term plan. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:20:52
I'll keep using coinbase, and recommending them to others, thanks. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:28:12
Hardfork now so we know whether or not the drama was even necessary. For science. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 09:13:39
Been working great for me and everyone I refer. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:18:21
Great argument. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 08:30:41
A good idea has merit separate from who had it. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:23:53
That line would have been appropriate 9 months ago. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:25:19
Because of the civil war and blocksize limit.

Childish because you sound like a kid on Xbox live. "shitty shitty stupid shitty." Such classless aggression, when you're not even right to start. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:37:52
I'm pro bitcoin, and anti this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 21:43:05
The fact is, it's not SegWit that's the real garbage. It's inflammatory users like you with never-ending insults and assumptions that are the problem. It makes the whole community weaker. I never said I was a developer, but I never said I wasn't, either. In fact, I am. But that you don't care to even acknowledge the [technical problems]( are real, and choose to pretend like there is no real discussion based on your call to authority. Just look at your messages in this thread. Very childish. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:48:58
You're right, core isn't in control. And the next few months will prove that. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:26:44
I'm not paid by Roger. Where do I sign up for some of that Roger pay?

At this point, it's too little too late. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:09:33
Are you Theymos? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:41:10
Don't include LN in any current scaling considerations until LN is not vaporware. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:00:16
Demonstrated it was not. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 01:28:59
SW is ok. It fixes transaction malleability. It makes bitcoin more complicated, which will forever increase technical debt. But if we don't learn how to do a safe HF soon, we never will. Plus, core. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:57:49
You're an idiot who understands no humor. And the conspiracy bullshit you're protecting on to me only shiws that you're more likely to be a sock puppet. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:16:48
Miners, especially those who are operating near/at loss, often depend on the a projected rise in bitcoin price for eventual profitability. Throughput reasonably correlated with price. So of course their interests are in allowing bitcoin to grow with increased throughput. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 23:13:52
I've been on Reddit longer than Bitcoin has. I'm a sock puppet too?
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:38:46
It's not equating. He's making a point about why the Chinese have gained a cultural lesson about avoiding "I'm right, you'll always be wrong" leaders. The fact that this is the biggest complaint you have about the opinion, shows strength in his thinking. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 14:29:10
2mb would not significantly increase the cost of owning a node. Even 8mb is not significantly burdensome. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 15:38:29
If you think this is over 0.3mb, you don't understand the conflict. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:07:52
Citation please 
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:24:40
Same with Ireland :-\
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:01:55
No, it's fine. People get dramatic around here 
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:01:10
Because he wants to self destruct his hoard of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:23:59
I don't agree, but I like your answer. Upvoted. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 14:31:47
Hardly. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 15:31:39
Much more than just new account sock puppets 
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:42:41
Yea, do what you want. Shut off your node. How people use the network and how much it costs to send bitcoin payments is dictated by supply and demand, not your own 2 month old philosophical beliefs. FYI, I'll be impressed if LN is competent to any degree that it raises the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:11:54
I'm highly suspicious of anyone who truly tries to demonize Roger, when his message has been fully consistent this whole time. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:04:28
P.s, readers, the person who said "posted it over there" was speaking in the uncensored forum
@_date: 2016-11-13 14:34:08
Prices for parking spots go up when the lots are full and people have nowhere to put there car. Makes plenty sense. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 08:39:36
Right. More inflammatory statements and none of the arguments addressed. Good job keeping a civil discussion. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:16:20
Lots of astroturf around here, I've noticed. The other sub is now the one heavier with technical discussion. Lots of nonsense and drama over here
@_date: 2016-11-01 14:41:58
Are you saying that BU doesn't have a 21M coin cap? 
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:25:05
We'll know soon enough what the Chinese miners think. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:27:10
Ok, example: the 2-4-8 plan that was supposed to be a core compromise. Wtf ever happened to that? 
I used to think bitcoin could just meld the features of whatever competing altcoin, but over the past four years I've also learned that Bitcoin protocol (for good reason) has a large amount of inertia. For the most part, the difficulty in changing things comforts me as I'm not worried about it breaking overnight. But on the flip side, for example, Bitcoin will never have the instruction set of Ethereum. 
Not only is it impossible for Bitcoin to just Katamari features, it would be bad if it did. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 23:09:37
And r/Bitcoin will blame it on Ver and ViaBTC when the dissent is greater than that. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 23:08:50
Read it directly from ViaBTC in the other sub. Don't let biased paraphrasing set your conclusions. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:46:18
More than this sub would have you believe 
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:51:31
That he's using bitcoin wrong. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:08:12
Do point that ignorance out, then. Easy to fling poo at someone else's well articulated technical arguments. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 00:23:36
Just a simple metaphor for limited supply and raising demand. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 02:43:43
Wait, are you saying my account is worth money?!  How much are you willing to offer? I'll take 1 BTC :-P
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:43:07
Go read ViaBTC's response to Adam in the free sub 
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:58:19
More like, "CEO of ViaBTC doesn't understand bitcoin, but read and make up your own mind." Slanted as hell. FYI, he makes so much sense it makes this subreddit feel dirty. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:44:57
No, we don't. That's not what this sub is about 
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:42:42
Yea, do what you want. Shut off your node. How people use the network and how much it costs to send bitcoin payments is dictated by supply and demand, not your own 2 month old philosophical beliefs. FYI, I'll be impressed if LN is competent to any degree that it raises the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:49:32
He doesn't need to be a developer. Just like you don't need to be a cook to know when food tastes bad. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 15:28:23
Shouldn't, because Roger isn't the one blocking SegWit. Just a scapegoat that isn't allowed to post in this sub
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:39:38
Stop giving Ver credit for everything. Hardfork before SegWit. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:05:01
Here's a good summary of why people think wikileaks is compromised: 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:22:59
Do note that one of the highest posts in the other sub is about how they're not against SegWit. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:18:16
That's not for you to decide 
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:14:15
Ironically it's not Ver to pin this on if SegWit doesn't get activated. He said he would if others did. But we do need a scapegoat over here don't we? 
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:21:42
Total myth that all the expertise lies in Core. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:22:02
Alternatively, you spend too much time in censorville
@_date: 2016-11-20 03:07:15
So crazy that they want to keep bitcoin functioning along Satoshi's original vision, instead of modified with sidechains that heavily shift power towards heavily funded centralized entities 
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:06:00
This was asked by Mr Back to ViaBTC, and answered very well. Go take a peek 
@_date: 2016-11-17 15:55:38
Anything useful being ported to bitcoin is a myth of 2012. Have you noticed how difficult it is to get any meaningful code changes? 
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:41:44
Redditor of 24 days, vs Redditor of longer than the existence of bitcoin. I should be asking you that same question. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 14:35:25
I downvoted because of your obvious concern trolling. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:19:38
The ultimate speculation and conspiracy thread. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:42:50
There's also the matter of precedence of safe hard fork. If there isn't one after all this talk about compromise for years, core may just procrastinate on a hard fork forever. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:19:37
Then you're part of the problem. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:30:34
If we want to talk about spamming crap, let's look at the shit that shows up daily in this echo chamber of a cess pool. Another personal attack against Ver, full of hate and inflammatory speculation, making exactly no progress for bitcoin or its community. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:19:51
Either interpretation is a complete fuck-you to actual users of bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-11-18 20:28:25
I'm not quite as harsh on Roger, but fair point about the two camps of thought
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:56:31
You're telling a bitcoin user that he isn't actually a bitcoin user? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:32:59
That's quite the mindset you're projecting. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:13:05
He did one of the most comprehensive AMA's I've ever seen, but it's inflammatory shit like your post that is a clear indicator of echo chamber danger. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:41:14
What brings you to that conclusion? 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:23:41
No. They share the same blockchain history. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:29:01
Exactly my point. There is a definition difference between "altcoin" and "fork", and saying they are synonymous is misleading. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:23:55
What's an example of an altcoin that shares the bitcoin Genesis block? 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:15:39
Yes, fork. Not altcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:21:23
Gavin: "I might be wrong in either direction. Which is why both LN AND on chain scaling need to happen." Humble acknowledgements like this need to be more frequent among developers. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:12:05
Actually that does help coinbase. If there is an expensive fee market, people have incentive to avoid fees by sending coinbase internal transfers. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:13:07
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:17:15
When all the dust has settled, and the topic is no longer live. Why? 
@_date: 2016-02-12 05:11:30
Gavin is an outcast? Not really. He's still as inner circle as it gets. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:16:41
Met the guy in San Jose bitcoin conference 2013. I generally trust his outlook and judgement. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:25:06
He's not "ignored" his CTO. Look up coblee's post history to see why their disagreements are barely disagreements at all. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:13:01
How about we demonize censorship itself, rather than people's hate for censorship. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 18:05:30
He hardly deserves that. He pointed out real issues and sacrificed his BTC position to get people to pay attention. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:29:12
This is like saying bitcoin is legitimate currency according to monopoly board game rules. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:17:39
Proof plz
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:22:40
The brainwashing and ignorance is strong in this thread. I'll bet you that he wins his bet. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:15:27
This is exactly the core of the debate. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:15:41
Damnit guys, this is how the housing market crashed in 2008. HAVE WE LEARNED NOTHING
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:46:13
Show us
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:38:35
Why would he say this when bitpay is pushing adaptive blocksize? 
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:20:27
You're kidding yourself. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 15:40:45
What, nobody blames the blocksize limit that's causing the transaction traffic jam?
