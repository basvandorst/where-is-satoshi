OMG! Headline! People are buying guns and drugs with US Dollars too! (And I hear some people use peso's and GBP and Euros, it's a scary would out there!)
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:57:11
Sounds good to me.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:59:03
Or you could donate to a [worthy cause]( instead
@_date: 2015-03-02 15:43:14
Wow, what rancid thoughts. Just goes to show, not everyone into Bitcoin is a forward thinker.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:09:00
Why pay Anon to do something the are already doing?
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:13:23
Not as much a detriment as some would think. And Anon isn't destroying their military comms. Twitter and such is just propaganda tools. They still have cell phones and operatives in other countries to recruit. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:24:03
Why would that be a sign of success? Wouldn't Govts liking Bitcoin be the sign of success?
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:53:59
Wow that almost seems to have nothing at all to do with Bitcoin. You nuts?
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:30:52
Yea, so why waste money on Anon? They can't do anything other than shut down twitter feeds and ddos websites. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:46:40
Ha, good one.
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:52:59
Wow so hostile. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:22:17
I won't hide, I'll just sit in my bunker! With 5 foot deep walls and steel doors! Bhwahahaha. Oh wait, this isn't @_date: 2015-02-24 19:35:48
Ah if only, But I can always dream of my hooker-bunker.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:33:05
I do need to stop worrying and love the Bomb I guess.
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:58:53
Not that I know but I've heard isolated stories from other countries of similar events, not at all on the level of the US though.
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:53:48
I gathered that as well. I never expected this kind of vitriol on a Bitcoin thread! Lol
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:11:05
With all these "no-knock" raids and such I'm starting to think we should all live in bunkers.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:14:37
Why ban words from a reddit? Especially words that have to do with the topic that sub covers?
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:18:37
Aha! Brilliant!, and Ma said I'd never find anyone!
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:57:35
Damn, that's a much better name!
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:17:21
Hmm, makes sense actually. Still 'banning' sounds so bad, there's gotta be another way. Or not, it's a toughie.
