They are protecting the hidden secrets of fiat currency... it has no value!  At least with cryptocurrency it is the market that drives the price, versus decisions made in clised rooms by people who are looking out for themselves...

Not by a long shot... all this is about is growing pains. The world has been taught that only a few, who know the secrets,  can manage the control of currency. Creation of central banks to control the oversight of monetary systems is the only way to create stable economies. Now we are at the dawn of a new way, be it an old method, of carrying out financial transactions. There are no hidden agendas,  no secret meetings, and no counterfeiting.  All transactions are public, and controled by a decentralized system. We will get past this and we will thrive. For those naysayers who beleive that central banking is going to prevail, your money will literally "not be worth the paper it is printed on!"

It isn't about creating hashpower, it is about creating a server farm. I understand that having hashing power available for those whose equipment is delayed,  but to build a server farm, sounds too much like another Butterfly Labs...

A bank and exchange are two totally different systems. Banks create funds based on withholding a small reserve. Exchanges are a point of barter where one form of equity is exchanged for another.  So, who is living in a dream world?

Rules like these are created by banks under the guise of "protecting" the customer,  when in fact they only protect the banks. But, because sheeple do not question the actions they give up a little more of their rights to the corporate masters...

The value of bitcoin is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. That is true of any commodity. The price will fluctuate based on that perceived value, as demand rises and falls. 
Just as stock in a company rises and falls based on its perceived value,  bitcoin will fluctuate in value as long as it is traded. Because it can be exchanged at numerous places, and that number increases daily, there is no central point that is required for redemption. 
Because of that lack of central control, bitcoin has accomplished a financial instrument that mirrors the convience of precious metals without the burden of having to physically transfer the commodity.

More fiat currency has been used for illegal use than ANY other form of financial tranaction... every time a criminal enterprise found with a very large amount of United States currency, do the banks refuse to transact in US dollars???

Well, without a private key they could not transfer bitcoins. And if they did try, they would have to control the entire blockchain, and without the hashing power of networked computers it would not survive. So it is a moot point.

Yet, once gold is stolen, you can exchange it immediately.  BTC, once stolen, requires an authentication phrase in order to exchange. It also leaves a trace to where it went via the blockchain. So both have their good points and bad points, yet they compliment each other, unlike other forms of currency.

So... you buy equipment to mine, and the company you buy it from will be competing for the bitcoins that you are trying to mine....... and how is this a good thing for the consumer? The only one who benefits from this is KnC... I'll look to other companies for my hardware.

Using this logic,  a gold miner could sell gold out of his mine, then when he distributed it, he closes his mine and that would make the gold worthless. There is an assumption that you have to go back to the mine to redeem bitcoin, thus causing a central point of failure. People have been brainwashed about financial transactions for so long that they have forgotten what currency is really about. It is a mechanism for the transfer of value, nothing more... nothing less.

This man teaches business and economics,  and can not distinguish between a bank and an exchange. And we wonder why our financial systems are broken.
