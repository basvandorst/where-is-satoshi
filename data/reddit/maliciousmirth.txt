Wasn't able to claim this tip :(     
Don't know if I messed up somewhere.  There was no link to claim....

I guess Im still a newb in this whole crypto-currency game, but I will say that a tip brought me here.  I will give OP support on this one.  I was tipped for some weird amount like a donuthole or something.  I was very confused for a loooong time about what that was or what to do with it.  When I tip I will make sure to do so for actual monetary amounts so that people can come here and find out how to manage it.  Good call OP!

I will be spreading the word.  Have a comical amount of BTC right now.  Wish I could tip, but for now I will try and get some visibility.

A tip got me here!  I remember two or three years ago when I looked at Bitcoin, and thought....."Ill get to buying that."  Two years later and I hadn't touched it.  Im kicking myself now, because I could have had 100's of bitcoins that would be worth much more than I paid for them.  Anyway my point is that recently someone tipped me in Bitcoin.  It led to me opening a wallet, subbing here, and doing a ton of research on it.  I will invest in this currency, and hopefully have enough to start tipping on my own.
