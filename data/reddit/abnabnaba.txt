lightning network offloads high volume payments off the main chain, enabling micropayment use cases. other ways of reducing network fees such as raising blocksize that are compatible should be used also. Do you have an alternative suggestion?

it's good for bitcoins to get distributed, hopefully the receivers will take good care of them

bitcoin is undergoing a growth phase where cheap transactions are getting priced out temporarily. Lightning network will offload high volume transactions and significantly relieve network fees
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:25:15
My *opinions* to your points:
1. maybe, whatever
 
2. bitcoin will never crash
 
3. I think it does, but perhaps not in its current draft
 
4. fees can't kill bitcoin, that doesnt make sense (fees = demand)
 
5. value storage can be done over bitcoin, wont change
 
6. cheap payment networks can be built over bitcoin
 
7. maybe, just a blip on the larger scale
 
8. (not sure what you mean? bitcoin has a currently traded price/value, it's not "actually" any other price)

why is everyone ignoring the fact that segwit WAS a blocksize increase? it was done niftily b/c it was a softfork but its definitely a blocksize nonetheless. I fully support working on solving scaling bitcoin but we have got to think of something other than larger blocks, it simply doesn't scale. Lightning network is not something to dismiss, you should learn more about it and help work on it, there is a LOT of room on off-chain scaling. Segwit included a temporary solution along with making off-chain payments more practical. Bitcoin is uncesorable first, payments will come, it has way too much network effect to be replaced, no need to FUD.

fungibility by default is crucial, traced transactions ruins the free market and will lead to government-coin, much worse than cash
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:34:37
people should know that fees WILL increase a lot, maybe we still have some time for regular on-chain p2p use cases but it will become too expensive for that, that is why off-chain scaling is important
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:31:23
Everyone hypes about the price like this when it begins shooting off but the underlying tech is still revolutionary. Yeah probably most hodlers aren't even educated on how bitcoin works and there will be a correction at some point or another because that's just the nature of the price movements, but bitcoin still presents something humanity has never had before. It's a protocol that will continue to get developed and make more advancements via crypto and networking breakthroughs
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:44:32

in case anyone is wondering this is about the claim that DCG *threatened* businesses to accept NYA, kinda a big accusation and BTCDrak claims there is proof
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:00:18
then you are thinking as if it is near its maximum value it will be. WROOOOONGGG.. bitcoin can easily become worth $400,000. There is a psychological barrier with bitcoin in that "1 coin is worth X" does not matter, you can buy any fraction, consider the fact that we could (and in my opinion should) start pricing bitcoin in terms of 1000'th, in which case its $3.5 per milibitcoin, doesn't sound so expensive now
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:29:04
2 things: 1stly, some off-chain network must be used for specific applications such as p2p payments, base layer fees will rise no matter what (regardless of how good or bad LN is) 2ndly, BCH is not "the alternative" there are plenty of much better other coins such as litecoin, dogecoin, etc. BCH is extremely centralized

im not too worried. The bitcoin ticker BTC cannot be taken over, the "bitcoin cash" scare will fizzle once we see more and more forks of bitcoin, bitcoin gold BTG already one example, bitcoin diamond (BCD) coming up! "Bitcoin cash" will get diluted with these, as there is only 1 bitcoin. Lots of free money incoming :D

pyschological trap. it is just as accurate to say you own 100,000 bits, (100 satoshi's = 1 bit, so satoshi's are like cents). It's going to be increasingly difficult to obtain an entire bitcoin, I think bits will become a more popular unit.
cup of coffee ~ 500 bits
gas fillup ~ 7,600 bits
dollar store item ~ 140 bits
usa electricity ~ 13 bits / kW.hr (16,000 bits / month)
minimal wage ~ 1,000 bits / hour

you guys are arguing silly stuff of what exactly is the definition of a wallet. coinbase has a wallet, you can access your wallet through coinbase, it is technically their wallet, they control it, they allow you to access it, I'm sure under a set of guidelines you can read in their detailed policy. In my opinion coinbase is too large and anyone who upvoted "coinbase is bitcoins killer app" needs to stop and reflect on what they just did. learn what bitcoin is for fucks sake, coinbase is by no means an application of bitcoin

the reason his point should be emphasized as much as he is emphasizing it is because bitcoin is special for the fact that your value can truly be yours, if you keep it with coinbase then you aren't really taking advantage of bitcoin and if you aren't savvy enough to manage your own coins, thats fine, it is probably safer to keep it with coinbase, but at least acknowledge that there is a huge difference. Saying that "coinbase is bitcoin's killer app" is one of the most retarded things I've seen get as many upvotes as is it, it's really concerning for this subreddit
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:54:25

what's worse is that bitcoin doesn't care who owns what key, the keys are the identities, faketoshi could actually have satoshi keys

1) the revolution happens in the spreading of ideas (social media), merchants who begin accepting bitcoin, anywhere that begins to use the bitcoin network (or other cryptos)
2) the enemy is corrupt centralized systems. In a way, bitcoin resembles an ideal system which the government is suppose to manifest, but because it cannot be ideal there is lots of corruption. Bitcoin and similar networks have the potential to elliminate centralized corruption meant to be run by a mass social consensis. Yes everyone is greedy and bitcoin builds incentives into the protocol.
3) Other than buying and holding, infrastructure needs to be built and knowledge needs to be spread, those are the top things in my opinion. Most extreme thing is to give talks, code, run simulations.

2x will fail, just accept it. If they actually implement replay protection and its a seperate coin, then it will not be called bitcoin and it will be another centralized shitcoin. By the way segwit was activated because of UASF, not NYA, get ur head out of ur ass
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:41:22
not an agreement by overwhelming majority. If "bitcoin" can be changed by a handful of top business CEOs then it will be a failure to many, but I am positive there will be no 2X hardfork to take the name "bitcoin". As far as the actual change goes, my opinion is that bitcoin needed segwit much more than any blocksize increases. Segwit is a blocksize increase also so it makes the whole the much more silly. The deal breaker for me though is 2X proponents refusing to implement replay protection, this is what makes it an attack
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:54:15
NO2X = NYA proposal is bullshit. Segwit was also a blocksize increase, by the way. the way it was done was super nifty but it is *actually* a blocksize increase
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:31:35
until decentralized exchanges are bigger you kinda have to have coins on an exchange to trade...
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:18:46
those sells can't happen until after the buys, therefor maybe btc gets more volatile but at a much higher price from here :D

@_date: 2017-09-20 18:30:03
refusal to implement replay protection is an attack, I was considering supporting 2X before but deliberately refusing to implement proper chain seperation is a massive red flag. I don't trust 2X proponents at all
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:08:07
your right its not a money, I guess I meant it more as store of value but still, both will continue to exist for speculation. I'm just referring to how precious metal people believe the metals are best to "store their wealth" in but I think crypto fits that role best
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:42:22
Its not tragic, that is essentially bitcoin adoption, they would need to keep reserves of bitcoin for liquidity. this would be banks "backed" by bitcoin and no longer the government, and banks could be competitive once again. Even if things were denominated in dollars, the bitcoin blockchain would be the final arbiter

great post. we need a functional payment network, hopefully lightning network can fulfill that, and it will be easier for people to trade goods/services for bitcoin. I'm sick of the sewage that our economy has become and it needs a major rewrite
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:53:17
Actually this is a fantastic point. There is for sure enough demand for each coin (post split) that it is a major responsibility for exchanges to credit both, but how can you do that if there is no replay protection?

RSK is not fully decentralized. Full 2-way pegged sidechains can't exist yet with bitcoin and so RSK requires "trusted" gateway operators. It's cool to experiment with the potential of REAL sidechains but this is not it yet, just letting people know.

people focussing on 21 million coins ever are looking past the fact that the anti-inflationary aspect of bitcoin is not in the total cap but rather in the issuance model, that its algorithmic and auditable. there are many coins which already dilute this "21 million coins ever" idea so the value is in the bitcoin system not necesarily in the specific number of coins

@_date: 2017-06-12 20:36:14
youve made a few valid points but the thing is, bitcoin WILL get segwit in time, and eventually have many of the features ethereum will have but the trick up bitcoin's sleave is higher layer networks and sidechains, they dont interact with the blockchain network directly and keep the whole system more secure. Secondly there is a strong tendency for whatever reason for people to feel like they must choose between the two, even if ethereum net value passes bitcoin, which will be nothing special by the way there are plenty of companies, other coins like XRP which have greater cap than bitcoin already, it doesnt delegitimize bitcoin in any way, at least for the time being. Also, ethereum has probably surpassed bitcoin a while ago considering all the tokens values too (did not verify this but taking a wild ass guess). Bitcoin has remained minimalistic and for a great reason. When it comes to where to hold your wealth, ethereum is still much more risky, but I do believe bitcoin will get the programmability as ethereum, no one knows for sure but its way too soon to call bitcoin dead and ethereum the new coin, im not buying it. for the record I hold both btc and eth, among others
