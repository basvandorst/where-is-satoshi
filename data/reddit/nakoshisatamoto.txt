His advice in regards to buying gold is not bad at all though. By investing 10% of your portfolio, even if gold goes down 10%, you only lose 1% of your portfolio. That doesn't sound terrible considering gold can't keep going down forever and also considering the upside exposure if all of this turns out to be true and does happen. I guess the same goes for bitcoin.
And he did mention bitcoin in another interview.

Of course my last post completely disregards how ridiculous it is to think bitcoin needs to catch up with ApplePay to serve 1st world lazyness when paying for crappy burgers at McDonald's.

Do you honestly believe the bitcoin market is living in its own little world and randomly decides to go up or down when it feels like it? You're very naive. Have you not noticed that both gold's and bitcoin's recent price reverse happened exactly at the same time and also aligned with the stock market's recent slide? And now that the stock market has recovered they're both going down again?

@_date: 2014-10-14 15:54:43
What a load of bs... The price went up at the same time as gold's. And that has to do with the stock market's abrupt decline. If gold turns back down, so will bitcoin.

Everyone makes bad decisions. There are so many people in your shoes it's not even funny. Some of them are actually in a much worse position for having already sold at a gigantic loss. Just hang in there. I'm not going to tell you bitcoin will hit 10k or even touch 1k again. But as long as you're holding your coins, you're exposed to full recovery and maybe even some profit.
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:22:47
The whole point of Bitcoin is not having to trust a third party and being your own bank. I understand most people lack the technical knowledge to keep their bitcoins safe under normal conditions, but as others have mentioned, a hardware wallet like Trezor pretty much solves the problem. Then again, maybe I'm being optimistic and most people will always need third parties to hold their money for them because they would lose it otherwise.

Someone correct me if what I'm about to say is in any way inaccurate.
The system is supposedly self-balancing. First of all, people are free to choose the fee they send. And in the end no one will want to pay high fees. Do low fees support the current mining operations? No. That just means miners shut them down, difficulty goes down and less resources are needed to process transactions and low fees will be fine.

If you had bought them when they were $0.10 you would have sold when they reached $1. Probably earlier depending on your financial situation.
Imagine you buy now, it starts climbing and reaches 400. Then starts going back down to 350. You're likely to sell at that point because you want to realize your gains and will miss out on $100k/btc years after.
This is all hypothetical by the way, just an example.

I understand what you're saying and I also understand that it's what you think. My first post wasn't even attacking your theory (at least directly), I was merely stating that I find it funny that whenever the price drops some big event happens at the same time to justify it for some (if not the majority). That said, the western markets have been following china, so unless the bitstamp insiders you're talking about all trade at Huobi/OkCoin, there's a sinkhole in your theory.

Basically what you're saying is that each long leg down is due to china, gox and now bitstamp and that if it wasn't for that, the price would still be at $1000+. I simply don't think that's the case. Bubbles are made out of hype, they are not organic growth. As long as the hash rate is going up, the price will continue to go down. I don't think bitcoin is going to zero, the legs down have been increasingly smaller, the price will stabilize at some point and we'll most likely continue to have new bubbles in coming years because that's what has happened ever since bitcoin started to be traded.

Like someone in another thread said, the people saying things like "maybe bitcoin the currency goes away but bitcoin the technology survives" must be expecting miners to process transactions out of the kindness of their hearts.
The technology NEEDS a currency and it's extremely unlikely that some other coin gets ahead of bitcoin at this point. How's this so hard to understand?
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:08:32
It fails before we even get to that part. You can't hold USD in a blockchain. You need cash or a bank account. Even if your idea of a decentralized exchange doesn't include instant trading like we have on centralized exchanges and you just want to buy or sell bitcoin directly from/to another user, there's no way to enforce a bank transfer. And I'm not even going to start talking about cancelled/refused international bank transfers and their fees. Of course none of this applies if you want to trade just in cryptocurrencies. But who really wants to trade their bitcoin for shitcoins?

I don't doubt you will send worthless amounts of bits. But nothing you say will make me believe you would actually send the 1 BTC prize. In fact, you've already removed it since I created this thread.
In the game/account of the screenshot I posted:
* Games played - 1
* Speed - random between 350 and 500 ms
* Time played - a little over 1 hour
These are perfectly reasonable for anyone that's good at the game. I could make it go slower and have the random intervals be more random and it wouldn't make a difference because you cap credit at around 70k satoshis.
And you do realize that by forcing "good players" to reach the 16384 tile within both undisclosed timeframe and undisclosed move speed interval limits is nonsense?
Let's face it, you were running a scam when you were offering a 1 BTC prize. Now that you've removed that prize, I'm sure all your microscopic payouts will be in order while you make a ton of cash in ads. I'm also sure not as many people will be playing the game without it.
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:39:09
There's only evidence that the offer **appears** selectively, and again, you can choose to decline it.
There's no evidence that EpicScale is installed without the user accepting it. People should definitely play it safe until there's more information, but declaring uTorrent guilty without proof and rage uninstalling while saying they'll never use it again after it's served them for years seems unreasonable to me.
And for those complaining about ads, yeah, that's what you get out of the box, but you do know you can disable all of it and have the client be as clean as a baby, right? No, apparently you don't.
At the end of the day there are so many options out there, just pick one and shut up about it.

There's no such thing as build 28913 and builds 28XXX are from 2012. I'll assume he meant build 38913. I can say I don't have EpicScale anywhere with that particular build and auto-updates on. I don't doubt it's offered with new installations but it seems users do have the option to decline the offer.
EDIT: I've just made a brand new installation on a test environment and I still don't see EpicScale anywhere. None of the details check out, this looks like a direct attack on uTorrent (possibly from competition) to me. And if this is indeed the case, I honestly find it hilarious that everyone is jumping ship over nothing. Learn2InstallWithoutOffers.
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:54:19


Not to a single player reaching the 16384 tile, right?


Because you were caught running a scam.


If you're trying to look good by trying to make everyone here believe I didn't get the 1 BTC prize because your awesome cheater detector caught me, that's understandable. If on the other hand you're actually trying to convince me... that's just funny.
I don't need to play the game manually because:
1. You cap credit at 70k satoshis and my bot had no problems getting up to that credit, so I wasn't really caught until I posted this thread.
2. The 1 BTC prize isn't there anymore (and never really was).
Like I said before, I never expected to get 1 BTC out of this. I knew that somehow there would be an excuse for the site not to give it away. I was curious about what that excuse would be and I did it for fun. And with this, I'm done replying to your fact twisters. Let's let people draw their own conclusions and let's get over this already.
EDIT: I would just like to add 2 more things:
1. There are a lot more people in the world able to reach the 16384 tile manually who would be beyond happy to earn 1 BTC every 2 hours (a perfectly reasonable time frame for a human to solve it that far) by simply switching IP addresses than you have BTCs to pay out.
2. One wouldn't even need to be good at the game or use an AI - Everything is client side and the score update requests could be faked to look legit.

I'm clearly stating that I used an AI engine.


So? Are you implying that a real player couldn't reach this board state? That's ridiculous.










And you're doing that based on board positions achievable by real players?












My account was getting BTC credit up to the amount that's on the screenshot, at which point the "limit reached" yellow warning popped up and all credits kept getting reset.
Let's assume for a minute that this is actually a legit service (which I don't believe for a second):
How long do people have to wait to play again after that warning shows up? Would one need to leave the browser open (since the site doesn't store any cookies for game state) for hours/days/weeks until the warning goes away and they can continue to play to reach the 16384 tile eventually?
There is no bulletproof way to tell good players and cheaters apart. Whatever you come up with will always end up punishing good players and rewarding cheaters.

It's capped. They show you that "limit reached" warning and any new credit keeps resetting to the amount you had when the warning popped up.
