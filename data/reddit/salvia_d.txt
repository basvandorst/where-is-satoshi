By the way, I went back to my previous answer and bolded my original answer. Guess you missed it the first time. And if you think this is just conspiracy, then you really haven't been paying attention to how US politics works for at least the last 4 decades.

I've been reading a lot of comments today and this is the most accurate and best one yet.

This is not "main stream acceptance", this is Wall Street control. Exactly what we were fighting against. 
I'm assuming you read this part of the report:


@_date: 2014-02-25 16:32:15
So let the devil control you! Price is too hi for me: 


@_date: 2014-03-01 16:04:30
Poetry, 3 upvotes - 3 downvotes. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:45:56
I'd go as far as to say that they are a huge problem. The one thing I don't understand is why in the world is the bitcoin community here calling this great news! It's like watching Egyptians welcome a military dictatorship... oh wait!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:13:43
So they will be price fixing and not allowing the market to decide the price. Well there goes the house. 
In the stock market, prices fluctuate, sometimes by huge margins (look at TSLA, NTFLX, GOOG, ETC.). that is the name of the game. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:58:17
We can't prevent it, especially Wall Street insiders, but we shouldn't be welcoming them with open arms. That's just insane and pathetic and shows how weak and fearful we are. Just because MTGox creates a little turmoil we welcome a private Wall Street exchange with open arms and call it the best news ever! WTF!
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:10:30


It's not. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:00:56


You mean the big banks and the Wall Street insiders. No thanks. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:18:35
You did too. And I agree with your comment, "To the FUCKING MOON (**for members**).
*edit: ClockCat beat us both to it. Guess i'll delete my original :)*
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:55:59


I bet they do, they are, after all, too big to fail. 
Amazing that the MTGox collapse has freaked out the Bitcoin community so much that we are willing to welcome private Wall Street exchanges for the big banks with open arms. 
Today, Bitcoin died, not because of MtGox, but because greed and fear kicked in and we sold our souls to the devil. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:14:20
Yes I do, Really! **Do you also realize how silly it is to ask why a private exchange for Wall Street insiders is a shitty thing to happen for Bitcoin? That's the part that you missed.**
I have no problem with banks getting involved, I'm actually for it. But if they came out and said they do allow bitcoin transactions and deposits but only for their hi end clienteles, then I would close my account and tell them to fuck off, which I think what the Bitcoin community should be doing. This will set a precedent, and a bad one at that. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:49:25
It will be a private exchange with big backing from Wall Street insiders. Do you actually believe they have the best interest of an open and decentralized market in mind? Really? **And you think once they have control, and they will, they will not lobby our "leaders" to pass laws to get rid of the little guys that they will be competing with?** Really? And you think this is a good idea for us, and what the bitcoin community should be supporting? A private exchange? Really? I think I missed the memo. 
@_date: 2012-06-16 16:21:24
Thank you.

@_date: 2012-06-17 16:58:43
Awesome! I might actually come and visit some friends this summer so i'll keep that in mind, if i get any bitcoins that is. Fun :) 
@_date: 2012-06-18 16:15:24
Thanks. Just a note. Your QR image is hyperlinked but it gives an error. Not sure if it's meant to be like that.

@_date: 2012-06-16 16:20:59
Cool, i'll look into this. Sounds like it might save me some time and simplify matters a bit. Thanks.

D'oh! :( looks like bit-pay is only for US. I'm in Canada. 


**Edit:** I sent them an email and got the following response (very quick reply):

D'oh I just went through bit-pay. I'll do the above recommendation once i get a little familiar with bitcoin. Thanks for seconding the motion. Peace :)

Do you have any links to the news, I'm having a hard time finding any official announcements for any country. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:14:08


So not yet in Japan. 
And it looks like not yet in Germany either, not a currency yet that is. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:35:34
First of all, this post is not for noobs, it's to mark a possible historical moment - a major bubble in the first and most important digital currency to date. Now that deserves a post. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:47:30
very possible.

This is my last reply to you. You're wasting our time. Peace. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:01:01


Agreed again, i used the wrong word in my previous comment, but I think you know what I mean. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:13:48
That's the same mentality as, there is never a wrong time to but a house. Those who listened to that advice in the 1980's had to wait 30 years for their houses to reach the same value or more, but 30 years is a long time to wait. And that goes for people who bought house in the mid 2000's. 
This is just the market and the way things work. There are also many factors that may contribute to a crash, you should consider those as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:41:43
You do realize that I am not advising anyone to be buying, so anyone that bought must have a more bullish outlook. Why would they sell if they just bought?  
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:35:33
I do expect some serious downvotes, but it has to be posted. At least this way no one can say that the info was not available. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:33:03
Why is it just in the comments? Shouldn't this be easily accessible since it contains all the info in one place? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:29:18
There is always a bad time to buy, the question is, is it now or much further in the future? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:19:23
Here is just one article I wrote in 2007 about the coming crash of 2008 and beyond (links to archive.org): 
* [Collapsing the Economy in the Buildup to World War III: 11 of the Most Important Economic Events of the Last 11 Years](
I didn't write my bitcoin article at random, and i'm not your *"any moron"*. 
*Edit: Here is the original piece, dated 2007-11-10, that the above was the third update for: [7 of the Most Important Economic Events of the Last 7 Years: Collapsing the Economy in the Buildup to World War III ]( just wanted to clarify since 'religiousidiocy' seems to be stuck on the wrong issue. I'd rather talk about bitcoin.*
*Edit2: And here is a secondary source because 'religiousidiocy' just doesn't want to give up the ghost: [Sunday, 18 November 2007 05:33](
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:58:37
Anyone able to cut and paste some of the info being posted there please. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:48:38
I really don't understand this mentality. For some reason, people seem to think that just because news was posted before it should not be posted again. You do realize that there are a lot of people that don't come here everyday, right? That maybe they missed an important bit of info, right? That they would never be able to find it if it wasn't for reposts, right? Just saying. 
As for it being posted 10 times here on sorry, i didn't hear about this news until i came across it on an hour ago because it made it to my front page. 
**tl;dr - Stop being haters, for some people this is the first time we're hearing about this.**
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:11:34
Guess you didn't even read the first paragraph. This was the third update from a series I started on 2007-11-10 (I built the pieces before this actually, in early 2007). Here is the link: 
* [7 of the Most Important Economic Events of the Last 7 Years: Collapsing the Economy in the Buildup to World War III ](
My apologies for the confusion, but then again, this isn't about my credentials or about being right or wrong. This is about addressing the problems we face. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:52:53


Agreed, a house has intrinsic value. 
*Edit: 'intrinsic' is the wrong word to use, but I can't think of the right word right now.*
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:23:21


WOW! Guess our conversation is over. 
*ps. By the way, welcome to reddit.*
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:50:00
I don't know if I can sit it out or not, still in the game, it is fun to watch though. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:38:18
Both are from my site, but I guess you really don't care about that. As for making specific predictions, being one of the few people that wrote extensively about the 2008 collapse before it happened - when almost everyone was pumping - I'd say I did pretty well. 
Again, this isn't a post about being right or wrong, this is a post about addressing some of the problems we face. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:43:56
cool, thanks. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:48:37
Thanks. As for the video, it got a little bit more strange, the video is no longer available. Funny that. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:51:48
Anyone else think that the problem with Coinbase is that it's based in the United States? Why would anyone trust storing their wealth in a company based in a country that has had a track record of seizing your wealth? I don't get it. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:29:34
This is not about being right or wrong, this is about addressing the problems we face. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:03:21
After the crash! No. It was a week before. As for what it will look like, take a look at the graph. The odds are that is exactly what it will look like. 
As for *genius*, no. Just someone that sees a bubble and decides to write and warn people about it. 
As for why I did it, because I care about the future of bitcoin and see some of the problems we face. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:58:57
I would be, but it doesn't mean that when the bottom is reached it will not work it's way up again. If you want a perfect example take a look at Prineline -&gt; [look at the ALL the data/chart]( 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:40:08
If you bought 2 years ago and are still holding to most of your bitcoins, or in fact, haven't sold most of them, you are playing with fire. When something rises almost 100,000% in 3 years it is a mathematical inevitability that it will crash, and hard. You should appreciate this because, if anything, bitcoin is a math based currency.

@_date: 2013-12-08 01:40:44
The price of bitcoins went up 100,000% in less than 3 years. That kind of movement in anything, is extremely unhealthy. The obvious reason being that it creates extreme inequality by pricing people out, which in turn turns off a huge potential market.

How about if the news didn't make it to the front page? What do you do with it now if it was important and you think more people should have heard it? How about if the story is continuing? Should you not keep it coming? 
As well, this isn't ... i realize that it is a great news feeder for those interested in bitcoin, but it's not just about 'the latest news', there is more to this sub than that. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:06:44
Me too, just a guess... weird though. I haven't come across this on youtube before. What are the odds? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:34:21
ps. if you don't like just downvote, if it gets enough downvotes I'll just delete it from here. I have it saved in other subs. Not a biggie, but I just like to keep things simple.
