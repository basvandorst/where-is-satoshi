Thanks for the quick reply. 
Surely all these news headlines can only deter the very uneducated!?

Hey guys just need some clarification regarding all these new government regulations. 
Firstly, as long as there is one country in the world without anonymity regulations, what's stopping criminals or anyone for that matter from sending all their crypto there?
Secondly, even if global anonymity regulations were to be in place in the future, how would governments ever regulate moving crypto by the way of cold storage, or people creating their own private wallets?

noob question alert:  If segwit adoption is so minimal, why is there such an emphasis on LN already?  Surely by the time segwit has scaled to maximum capacity, LN would be ready to go?

the BTC downtrend sucks, but its so nice to watch all the altcoins get fingered even harder. Im longing BTC as soon as  the un-mineables start dropping out of the top 10.

The bounce from 1.7-1.9 would be so swift, much smarter to set limit buys $200 - $300 higher  in case you miss it.   
Waking up in the morning to realise  limit orders weren't triggered because i was too greedy by $100 is a worse feeling than missing a pump imo

Thats very true! But even a coordinated attack on gdax for example, would only temporarily lower the price on gdax. Now a coordinated attack from multiple whales across multiple exhangeswould be a different story!
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:24:32
Also, how would coinbase know whose cold storage address it Is? Its pretty simple to create your own cold storage wallet without a single piece of personal information. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:39:56
Sorry to burst your bubble, but a whale or two doesn't really have that much swing with the price of BTC anymore 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:06:03
People like Ver are half the reason governments are worried. Regulation shouldn't even be a topic of discussion until BTC market cap is in the trillions

I think you misunderstood me mate. Cold storage is anonymous. Send your taxes to an exchange wallet such as coinbase. Then send taxes to irs from coinbase account. All that can be traced is your coinbase wallet address.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:22:49
Exactly! No one is going to jail for tax evasion based on assumptions &amp; educated guesses

Can I buy weed at your dads store? Because if I can buy weed with crypto then that's all the adoption I need
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:41:37
Laughing at anyone commenting that this is how the government will match identities to wallet addresses. Keep your bulk in cold storage, transfer to exchange wallet and send taxes from there. Gee that was hard

Noob question alert: Is LN required for atomic swaps between BTC &amp; LTC? Also, will Atomic swaps be automatically activated once mainnet is online? Cheers

Apart from dodgy ICO's, where are all the crypto scammers you're talking about? Even if you were right, people investing &amp; spending crypto should be tech savvy enough to spot a scam. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:35:14
I totally agree with that example, except I'm confused when it comes to how I would be linked to an anonymous cold storage wallet. Unless I'm sending the exact amount of btc I owe to the IRS from cold storage to coinbase haha.

Think about your argument. Your smartphone currently records every other piece of your personal information, why do you suddenly draw the line at bitcoin? I'd be more concerned about  "allowing app permissions" on apps like facebook, than having my account balance securely stored on a public ledger.
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:04:11
you moonbois havent been here long have you? 
im reading finex at 14.7k volume on the daily.
and a pump like that on minimal volume is definitely not bullish. 
what happened to this sub?!
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:35:00
You said it, Low volume = no sellers.   
if you've been in crypto or trading in general for this long, you'd know high volume pump is as healthy as a high volume dump like you mentioned.    
Also, notice how the blokes that have been on this sub for a few years are all poking fun of the sudden moon boy sentiment?
