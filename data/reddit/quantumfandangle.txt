It's rough around the edges and the build quality is mediocre but I'm very happy with the device.
You don't store any coins on it, just the private key, but I know that since I can't get the private key, no one else can, the only way they can steal my bitcoin is by breaking into my house and taking the seed card, which is a word short anyway cos passcode.
Any hardware wallet will be fine, so choose the one that matches your budget or any other criteria you might have (I wanted mine quickly, and trezor were getting it to me quicker than ledger)
I'd highly recommend one.

Transactions to and from the exchange are counted. 
Trades on the exchange do not.

Well, maybe.
But it's not a per coin thing, it's more, money people invaded crypto in their belts and braces like a bunch of 80s guys

This is good news.
That $500 dip won't last, so now is the moment to take advantage and double down.

This is my thinking. I'm hoping this is what happened cos I was half way through a trade when this started to shoot up and now I'm stuck on the wrong side of it until one of two things happens; litecoin goes up or bitcoin goes down.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:07:43
if you're in the UK you can use Bittylicious or Localbitcoins

Just keep in mind that it is adjacent to impossible to make solid predictions on crypto.
Case in point:
I asked the missus earlier to look at my Bittrex chart for OmiseGo (omg) and she correctly predicted the next hour's worth of movement based on the rest of the day's performance; a gentle dip followed by a sharp rise.  I zoomed out of the chart, which only goes back to mid june.  I commented that if I'd had access to last year's charts, I could overlay them on this year's, find the similarities and set my buy and sell orders accordingly, but that is a fallacy, because having done it with Bitcoin, there are practically no similarities at all  and her prediction was just a lucky guess.
I got her to do the same with Neo, and off that information, I dumped all my neo.  It then mooned. I lost £200 versus holding until just now.
The moral of the story is, we're all walking around in the dark in a room with constantly changing topography.  Buy a pie, eat it and watch the charts.

You are totally correct.
However, might I posit an opinion:
I believe in bitcoin; I believe in it's power to change the world, however, I do not believe it is the money of the future.
What I do believe, is that it is what the money of the future will evolve from.
Before Cellular Telephone, you had the landline.
Before you had MS Word, you had an electric typewriter, and before that, a mechanical typewriter.
Before Compact Discs, you had Cassette Tape.
Before you have a one-world universal money, you had Bitcoin.

Personally I feel that the correction will be half or less of the rise, that is to say, if Bacon has 8 rashers, and jumps to 16, expect it to settle on 12.
But that's just how I feel and is based on previous trends; bitcoin rises and then falls, but never goes down as far as it was as we can see from [this chart of the last year's performance](

I don't think that will happen, but even if it does, the market isn't fucked.  It'll be hairy, but it will recover.
It's when it hits 0, that's when you panic.
