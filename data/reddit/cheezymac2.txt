Gotta ride the Bitcoin waves my friends. ����

Got your first bitcoin RAPE machine. 
The fees on those things are ridiculous! 
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:23:26
Imagine if your bank charged you 5% every transaction. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:48:51
If you or anyone else is comfortable losing 5-15% every time...then there is nothing anyone will say that will stop you.
A fool and his money will soon part.
There are PLENTY of other options available. The high fees are what’s keeping the average joes from using these machines. At least in the United States. 
My point is that if have other options...it would be best to do that instead of bending over the barrel. 5% is on the lower end that I have seen to be honest but it is still  unattractive.
Although it’s good to have a presence in the mall where bitcoin will get exposure....it’s also bad that the average joe will associate bitcoin with high fees because of machines like these.

@_date: 2019-06-27 23:41:25
That was an exaggeration lol but yes I was just about to cash out $4 and now I have almost $2 because of the drop
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:36:17
There is some truth to what he’s saying but also he’s going about shit the wrong way.
You should know what you are getting into, but the goal is adoption and if I were a noob I would be put off by a guy like that. 
I simply asked because unlike him I don’t have time to sweat in front of a computer and watch everything that’s happening moment by moment. 
He was just projecting, guys like him usually have $3.25 in and changes his social media bio to read “crypto investor”
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:59:46
Best answer
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:54:23
You can use cash to buy with the LIBERTYX app.
