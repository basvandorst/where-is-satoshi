I completely agree :)
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:35:29
did someone delete this from @_date: 2014-07-06 20:36:29
Do you have a link to that?
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:46:18
thank you very much :)
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:59:32
Thank you for your constructive criticism :) Yes I get what your saying, I guess it was my fault for using intrinsic value is a very loosely held definition.    
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:28:01
Well I'm sorry you feel that way :)
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:11:56
lol normally I'd agree but I was on vacation for over 12 days and when I came back I had a few days of work and setting up a few news miners that were delivered while I was gone. I'm sorry that you feel my content is outdated, but my goal of this channel is to inform bitcoins :)
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:01:22
yes, I know but it takes time to do a video and edit and make sure all the information is correct
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:43:02
thank you so much :)
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:23:40
I'm sorry you don't like my videos :( could you give me constructive criticism? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:23:32
Yes, I understand. When I filmed this video I forgot to turn on the receiver, so while the transmitter was on the receiver was not, so I had no choice but to report to the audio on the camera :( Thanks for the comment and watch though :)
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:24:08
thanks :)
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:35:05
Thanks so much for the donation :) I'll try that
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:12:12
Thank you, and yes it you watch some of my other videos, I've very middle of the line with bitcoin, calling out something if I think it is wrong or over hyping. I try with every video to get better at what I do. :)
@_date: 2014-06-16 15:16:08
Yes I agree, but the purpose of this video was to respond to those saying the price has stagnated and my goal was to explain while in a long term viewpoint bitcoin is doing exceptionally well :) 
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:19:51
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:51:10
I have tons of experience, I'd love to help you in any way possible!
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:13:05
yes he does lol
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:40:25
thank you very much :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:58:10
I would love to, I have so much experiance to offer, I've spend time with my local House Rep :) I PMed you :)
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:41:13
You are correct, I was implying for the bitcoin client, but I can see how users might get confused at that statement :)
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:00:05
In NewEgg's press release they said they were making it the default form of payment, that's the information I was going off of. As for intrinsic value, I know exactly what you mean, but I was using it in the lose term referring to backing or proven value :)
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:26:32
I don't know if it gets traction it could go big :)
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:23:47
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:41:14
Do you have a twitter? I am an 18 year old student who has been very active in local politics and I'm currently been sitting in on every 3 live Ohio house of representatives session, I'd love to get to talk to you and hear about your experience :) please message me :)
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:13:41
I think it will be sent to their address/bank account reguardless
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:27:02
I believe right now there is only one or two
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:47:45
very true
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:18:39
Those are great questions, to which they haven't really discussed but I'm hoping they release more info soon :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:41:19
well storj isn't a spamcoin, its a program and web interface.  Plus the developers have no connection with florin. Florin is the first coin to add transcations comments, with makes it easy for the storj developers to work with
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:27:48
yea, I'm the guy in the video and thank you very much :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:54:53
I have one :P just forgot to wear it and was testing out a new expensive lens so I had my camera back further than normal :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:54:11
yep :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:47:32
BTW one note to add they hope to integrate this into bitcoin in the future, so it's a huge plus for bitcoin that this succeeds :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:03:36
yes correct, now we just have to see how it plays out :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:53:22
yes right now it cost to join, because they are in beta and only open to those who crowd funded them to get started :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:46:31
well not technically, you are paying to host data on decentralized computers, you can choose to give up say 200gb of your hard drive for an yet undisclosed amount in return for free 
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:55:28
I'm sorry but you are misinformed sir. You have to imagine it more like trading USD to Euros and then investing in a stock exchange in Europe. ASICMiner isn't taking the money from bitcoin, its just bitcoin money being reinvested.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:42:42
Hey guys it's Jason from GamersGoneTech, you know the guy that does all the YouTube videos lol. Anyway everyone is saying this guy is fake, but he isn't I have had many emails with him and he has his picture and google plus linked to his gmail. We actually have had very interesting conversations. Anywho just wanted to verify this man. Sometimes I wish the bitcoin community would be a little more trusting and less of a circle jerk, but I digress, have a great day my friends.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:45:23
honestly what the heck are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-07-03 01:44:38
For anyone wondering, May 18th I created a video talking about ASICMiner breaking 2BTC a share, that was roughly 40 days ago and it's more than doubled, which is crazy! I predicted that this was very possible back then, I encourage you to go check out my videos. I'm also giving bitcoin news on my channel :) 
video in question: 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:54:05
umm I still don't have any idea what your talking about...
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:59:43
wait what lol?
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:00:03
lol I'm 18 :P
@_date: 2013-02-06 03:45:49
May I ask in what you find in question about the posted video? What factional evidence do you find misleading? Or is your response opinionated? 
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:23:38
If someone could help me make a general layout I'd be down with doing a video, I already have over 40 high quality bitcoin videos posted :)
@_date: 2013-01-31 04:30:10
@_date: 2013-01-31 02:56:04
I filmed and finished editing 45 min before the news broke :( it was already uploading when I found out
@_date: 2013-01-25 01:28:58
Yes, that and many other sources have greatly influenced me in wanting to give the BitCoin community weekly news :)
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:56:25
Yes, I do many bitcoin videos, I also produce archery videos and product reviews, but mostly bitcoin. I really enjoy making the bitcoin videos and having people like you give me positive feedback really makes we want to keep producing videos :) Thank you :)

Well actually I have 3 mic's lol. I have one that sits on the camera (which doesn't work until I upgrade to a better camera), I have a H4 handy recorder and I have the one that clips on to my shirt and wirelessly sends to my h4 handy recorder. I value your option, do you think the audio in the ones with the clip on mic are better or the ones without the clip on mic (2 channel audio from h4 handy recorder)?
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:40:35
wow thank you very much
@_date: 2013-09-03 00:42:33
I know, and as I stated I'm the first to be questionable with them, but they have started to show the ability to get more employees and I think it could be possible they would release it and I wanted to inform people so they could make educated decisions. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:32:07
In my defense I made this video Sunday and the price has really exploded in the past few days
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:12:54
Hey jere_jones, if you do decide to also do your stand alone podcast I would love to help and or be a guest if you would have me. Sounds fun and I love the idea of a bitcoin podcast and having the ability to progress and help get bitcoin out to the genural public :)
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:48:07
Yes sir this is Me :) You literally just made my day, thank you so much for your comment :)
@_date: 2013-07-03 11:12:50
Again glad I could help a fellow bitcoiner :)
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:57:12
Ok so I literally watch like all of your shows since you did one on some external storage device. I absolility love your show Chris, I can agree that more people covering bitcoin is amazing and will hopefully get more people involved. I currently do videos on YouTube covering bitcoin, mostly just a weekly news series called "BitCoin Weekly," but would love to help you out in any way possible. I already filled out the form and even if I can't be on the show, I would love to help in anyway possible. My weekly videos get about 1,000 views and I have a little following and strive each and every episode to improve and better myself for my channel and audience. Anyway so excited either way because you would honestly help bring more news to bitcoin and also help show people the bitcoin community is growing. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:35:10
I honestly don't know what you are talking about?
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:56:35
Thank you very much and hehe that I prefer to keep private, maybe someday I'll reveal the total number. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:07:21
thanks :) 
@_date: 2013-07-03 03:35:43
Omg so glad I could help :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:12:49
