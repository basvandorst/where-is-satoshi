Just remember Craig Wright owns a lot of BTC and has a plan to sell large amount every month to pay for his pet project �� BSV aka Bullshit Vision - which is doomed to fail for so many reasons and unanswered questions. (He is hoodwinking ppl that don't understand economics and the twisting the word 'cash'!, there are 2 definitions of 'cash' when you look at the history of finance &amp; economics - not all cash is the same!).

This is to our advantage today - to capitalise on their ignorance &amp; stupidity.
(Once you view Bitcoin as money and know Bitcoin is hear to stay then market fluctuations don't feel and seem a big deal; mkt crashes in BTC is simply a reflection of how most people view BTC at the moment &amp; there stupidity).
There is one thing I can say is a scam '99% altcoins' are a SCAM; yes that includes BCH &amp; BSV unfortunately.

Linux - Ubuntu is the best/safest OS for running a full node.

No, it's not possible due to SHA256.
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:26:15
So, its now reasonable to say BCH &amp; BSV is unnecessary &amp; practically a scam now!?
(I just can't see how CSWs BSV will dethrone BTC).

I'm almost 100% certain BTC will be worth $1m by 2030!.

We've moved well beyond that risk today. (That was a real risk in the early day's though).
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:05:50
You right, because most people know if you try to replace &amp; discredit BTC, you would be destroying the whole Crypto market in the process - hence BCH/BSV hang themselves!, therefore it's BS what these two communities say!.
We don't even know if Craig really is Satoshi!, we all know Mike Hern, Gavin Andreasan etc from the early day's!, yet - Craig only appeared once on news in 2015 and only become active since BCH existed!, everything Craig says is 'I will, we will', but often the opposite happens &amp; he NEVER talks about past progress to relate to the here and now!. He appears to enjoy the attention and the limelight, that's not the personality of a scientist! - red flags anyone!?

You need some source for savings because fiat is constantly getting debased!. There's Gold bullion, but it's still speculated on the market; BTC is the only best for savings - as we all know how much there will be.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:51:57
The question is, when will that ceiling be reached? If ever? (The point where the market becomes saturated that no more increase in value will ever happen again!). 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:23:26
What about 10 to 20 years time?
(What is the equilibrium? When the mkt is fully saturated, that will be when it's too late for people after that!).
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:40:31
I bet this is all to do with BTC Bitcoin?
Nothing to do with BCH &amp; BSV Bitcoin!?
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:05:12
It's been constant bear market since beginning of 2018, we havnt had a sustained period of consolidation yet! (markets always have consolidation); so there will be no major rally for a year or so.

I've tried to find technicalities of his chats, but all it appears to be is... "First investor, spendable as money, conflicts with BTC and BSV" None of which is actually technical, and who cares? 
I've been in Crypto long enough to know the more noise = &gt; risk of scam (they have more reason to talk!).
Any crypto that is not publicised much but comes out with new tech/growth for the project frequently whilst appears rarther discreate is the one ppl should instinctively listen too, because dev's etc don't want mkt instability/excitement bubbles, know there product is 'truly' valuable, &amp; have no - or little time for social media because they are too busy working!.
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:32:58
This is why BCH &amp; BSV is pointless now.
(People don't care about one man's vision; ppl care it works, deflationary, safe, &amp; fast - BTC is NOW!).

I always believe in 'wallet.dat' as full node to be the safest way, as it's not subject to spv wallet bugs, or worrying about storing on exchanges &amp; web wallets.
(Be you're own bank, it feels great holding and validating the entire blockchain!).
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:43:48
You need both; but not too much of one over the other, preferably 60% trade over 40% hodl is ideal.

They say it's not 'centralized' if it's all pools, but who own the pools? NChain &amp; CoinGeek!; &amp; if miners do everything, who checks them? No one!.
(That's why I believe full nodes ought to play a role, like in BTC, they may not be perfect, but it's better than all just miners).
The thing is, BSV dethrowning BTC would hang themselves, because confidence in the entire industry will be rock bottom if BTC got dethroned - it's reached a point that BTC is too big to fail, if it did all WILL be effected!.
BSV people need to ask: Why are tickets to coingeek events extreamly expensive, lavish &amp; showy!? Because it's a business in itself through hype &amp; glamour!, a scam. They don't care mining at a loss because it's keeps up the facade about BSV, making huge profits through ticket selling - hence pays to mine at loss!. If the facade breaks down, they will turn off there rigs!!.
Nothing is clear &amp; no new questions are asked about CSWs ongoing lawsuit!, it's all gone silent!.
I've had a nasty thought, I really hope I'm wrong!:
CSW appears a desperate man by his behaviour and rudeness that I feel BCH (but couldn't take it over), so BSV! is his pet project he wants to work out to PAY the lawsuit of $10bln for Dave Klieman estate! - resulting in bringing down the BSV market when that happens!.
Looking at Calvin Ayres career and behaviour doesn't attract confidence either!. Perhaps I'm being too judgmental and unfair on him?
What do you think, opinions and thoughts welcome!?

Electrum server? You mean SPV (Simple Payment Verification) server node? Stores block headers only.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:46:52
I'm so frustrated with all this altcoin crap including BCH&amp;BSV!. Just BTC and damm the rest, it causes so much confusion and makes many losses for investors!.
If anything, altcoins actually hamper growth!.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:50:48
Yes, any change, either spend or add more to a  'wallet.dat' file - all previous backups must be replaced with the latest updated one. 'wallet.dat's are great for life savings, but not for regular use. Mobile SPV Lightening Network wallets for regular use.

Well, lets look at 30 years time; I predict $10m+ per 'whole' coin. (People talk like Bitcoin or no Bitcoin - as in 1 or 0, when people that have 0.05 are still Bitcoin, but just a lower denomination).
