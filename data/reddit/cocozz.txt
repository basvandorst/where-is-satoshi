I tried it yesterday while I was looking for a wallet on my Air. I would suggest to the creators to add an "Open Wallet" option if ever you don't want to create a new one when you start the software for the first time. 
Other than that, great piece of code !

Exactly, that's the point, even if the initial bid was of a fewer thousands of bucks, it still ended up in a big snowball of about 10.000 BTC. All kicked in by a single transaction, from one individual. I honestly wouldn't put a single penny in Bitcoin right now, and I've myself invested quite a lot a year before.

This is really cool, I just signed up for an account to see what apps are ready to be installed from Cpanel (out of the box like). I am going to start a big cycling trip and I was thinking to make a blog to share our travel stories.
For how long will the free account last ?

Can confirm, myself in Argentina right now, and people ask me how much I want to buy my dollars off, really sad.

Probably yes, it is gonna crash.
The good news ? It will go upwards again and beat it's previous highest value.
Don't worry and hold.
