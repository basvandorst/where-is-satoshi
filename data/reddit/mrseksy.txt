That'll be the day

That makes a lot of sense actually. Thanks.

Okay, I suppose no matter what, anyone having that much power over it is a very bad thing.

But why would they? Wouldn't it be in their absolute best interest to keep bitcoin going? Would they benefit in any way?

Genuine question:
But then what's the point? If you'll just immediately exchange to fiat if it looks bad or accept BTC if it looks good, I would just accept fiat and then if I think BTC looks good I would invest fiat into BTC. Why have the complexity of what you're saying?

While I agree, I think the point isn't that the next drop will be the exact same as others, just that it isn't going to be one days gains worth, but that it will drop to well below recent gains. When something is overvalued and it corrects, it generally falls to below it's actually value before crawling back, and I think that's just what these guys are trying to say. 
Earlier, there were some guys on this sub looking at the mt.gox crash down to $200 and then saying the next bitcoin crash will go down to $200. That is just stupid, but I don't think these guys are saying similar stuff.

Yes, the tobacco leaf used as a paper is tabacco

A backwood doesn’t have weed in it. A backwood is tobacco wrapped in a tobacco leaf. People often buy backwoods, unroll them, throw out the tobacco inside and use the tobacco leaf to wrap weed into a blunt.
He could be smoking a regular backwood, which wouldn’t have weed in it.

Don't get out. Bitcoin has proven to be super resilient. 
What you should do is buy.

It’s just Bloomberg articles before they are published, not company information before its published.
That’s not insider information, it’s just having the ability to act before the effect a Bloomberg article would have. People could be aware of information even before the Bloomberg terminal if they just do the research themselves.

It absolutely is necessary if we want to grow the economy in any meaningful way. 
The only way to increase future production is to invest. 
An inflationary currency disincentives people from holding onto their money and encourages them to invest it. If you invest your money you should be able to match inflation, and even grow your money in real terms. 
The government is only “robbing” you of buying power if your an idiot and you sit on your money. Also, I don’t get why you want to be able to sit on cash, it doesn’t help anything.
