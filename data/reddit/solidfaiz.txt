There are reports of China crackdown on mining, no more cheap electricity etc. at least that’s what I read on coindesk: 
Personally less influence from one region benefits the system as it will improve competition in mining in my opinion from different regions. China houses 2/3rd of mining and gave us bitcoin cash, so let’s see how that will go. 
My opinion and strategy is rock solid, hodl no matter what and buy those beautiful dips, which eliminates the weak hands ��

Bitcoin cash used that tactic by forking bitcoin and profiling itself as the original bitcoin.  Which results in negative confusion in the market.
It can be used as a dirty tactic to make fast money.

I wouldn’t call it a garbage copy of BTC.
There fork was friendly and not hostile to BTC and the way he and his team are handling it makes me trust their efforts in further developing the crypto space in a positive way.
In other words they are a positive addition complimenting bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:57:51
It also keeps me thinking. I’m on the more bullish side of this story, but it could also mean traditional investors spur of to gold and other commodities. So far struggling economies shown that they go to bitcoin (Venezuela, Zimbabwe etc). But what would citizens of developed countries do is the tricky and “leap of faith” part
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:23:05
That’s what I’m noticing for sometime as well. 
But I’m hesitant to act upon it, because I might come to late to that trade routine

I agree with that and accept downvotes as well
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:03:32
You make some very good points.
However assuming bitcoin transformed from form of payment to form of wealth storage and mass adoption kicks in, due to its growing public interest. Wouldn’t it be logical that the price will continue to move up due to its scarce nature of 21 million coins and 7 billion people on earth?
I understand what your saying that other tech could make it go absolute, but for now the case is different.

Be carefull with what your wishing for. A weak dollar will mean your purchasing power will decline. Considering your in a country (USA) that does mostly import you will have a problem, due to the USA not producing everything you require.
And even if they will (which will take many years as in a few decades) you will have the same problems as mass producing countries (think negative environmental impact). 
I could go on but remember the power of the dollar is it’s strength on a world stage and if you weaken that a other currency could take its place and you’ll be left behind

I’m was actually looking into doing a down payment and my inner voice is constantly telling me that the real estate market in the are is unreasonable, due to anyone just paying what is asked. Strange considering that the buyers are young graduates who get down payments through their parents.

Dude, seriously hang in there. You made it this far, just study and enjoy the stability you’ve achieved. Get just any job available while studying and save by living modest/below your means (which you’ve proven to do) and with the every 3 months take a bit out of your savings (let’s say 10%, to maintain a emergency fund with the 90%) and go with it.
Remember that investing in yourself is never bad.
Never finished college and really regret it, so you’re actually in a privileged situation in comparison to me.

@_date: 2018-09-10 04:23:18
I’m basing my following reaction on what I’ve read by Andreas his books, forgive for not literary quoting correctly:
The internet is basically a dumb network, which sends data from point a to b. This data can be in the form of a picture, voice (calling), text etc. where eventually phone companies started building there services on top while at first seeing it (and was) a threat.
He compares Bitcoin with the internet as also a dumb network as it sends value from point a to b.
How can it be used other then a currency? Could it be that through other layers developed on top of the current network, that we could exchange value in the form of i.e real estate ownership?
The Lightning network already paved the way for “Lapps”, which is similar to dApps. 
So I’m curious actually what other envision it’s growth besides a currency alone

Exchanging value is the whole point of a currency. Otherwise Bitcoin and alts are just a new form “forex trading” without direct exchanging value. People need to drop the Lambo dreams and use it as intended and while doing so just be frugal and your wealth will increase due to adoption.
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:28:42
To be fairly honest we are infected by a weird form of inflation, which luckily isn’t because of a central figure able of creating more bitcoin. But more in a form of large sums showing up and pushing its price down (think mt. Gox seller)
@_date: 2018-08-15 03:44:57

Indeed risky, but those who could envision how computers would become important to human life would of bought in as with a digital currency alongside centralized fiat (not always bad).
What sets us apart from the age of computers and internet? The fact that there is now a digital piece of mathematical code that is unable to be copied.

Milenials prefer cryptos over stocks.

I think this puts us on the same stage as the US dollar as in why should we use it as to “why should I use Bitcoin”.
Both have unique properties.
- centralized 
- goverment controlled
- world wide use
- value defined by “believing in its worth”
- inflation (no store of value)
- decentralized
- borderless
- no middlemen (no goverment)
- value defined by network and math
- deflation (store of value)
Pick your play and for now hold both

I don’t really think that should be the case.

A node validates transactions on the network just like miners with the exception that you do not participate in finding new blocks.
The beauty of a node also is that helps further decentralizing the Bitcoin network and securing it. More importantly is that you can do your own transactions without needing 3rd parties.
There are some tutorials you can find on this sub and I recommend checking around or ask

That money was for that and I wouldn’t mind losing it on shoes. But I’ve re-adjusted my priorities and still buying shoes but putting a good amount of my money at work.

The problem I think is most people do not care (yet). If people would really understand how fiat money is created we could really have revolution, which some of the speakers in the docu are saying.
However what amazes me most is the fact that a lot of people don’t even seem to know that the dollar and euro aren’t pegged to gold and if you explain that to them you look like the lunatic.

Why address reuse is discouraged:
Reduced security An unused address is protected by ECDSA AND several SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 operations, but only ECDSA after being used because the public key must be revealed during spending. This has been shown to open up several possible attacks in the past.[1]
Reduced privacy All participants who you give the address to know it is yours obviously. They can use this information to analyze incoming and outgoing transactions to identify other addresses you own and who you are interacting with, not to mention how much bitcoin you have. This can be serious for businesses in competition or in situations where a payment might might put someone into harms way (politically unpopular donations or as a means for extortion, etc).

It makes sense in a way that in its current state it wouldn’t work. Just think about the peak in December that fees rose to +/- 50,- usd. 
But not only that with all the small payments your transaction fees would build up as a hefty tag over time. 
Since your traditional credit-card doesn’t have these fees it wouldn’t be a bad idea to just pay your credit card with the bitcoins you’ve sold sparing the network. 
If Ln was already deployed it would of been a different story, which I think is what Tony tried to explain but delivered poor

This reminds me about how the rothschilds acquired their wealth. 
After the war of England against France, lord Rothschild sold all his shares and everyone thought he had information about England losing the war against France. The masses followed his move and the market crashed terribly.
At the same time that happened he bought almost all the dumped shares for a fraction of what it was worth.
When news finally (officially) arrived on England winning the war against France, all shares on the market sky rocketed resulting in him becoming immensely rich.
Also in the Netherlands the Jews used a somewhat similar tactic. You could buy shares on boat cargo arriving from Indonesia to Amsterdam. However the “shares” you’ve bought would only bring in dividend if the boat arrived. 
They used people in Zeeland to spot boats and report back as soon as possible so you could by these shares to cash in with ease.
Moral of the story: 
market manipulation isn’t solely exclusive to crypto and the same tactics they’ve used in the past are still applied today.

Relax, it’s a thought not a crystal ball prediction.
But it makes sense, because you will have to safely store your assets to avoid being a easy target.
The point of bitcoin is providing a decentralized currency, which isn’t controlled by banks, governments etc and mainly provide a substitute to “magically printing” of money. 
It’s still not matured in any way so will see where it goes. If this is to much for you then take a step back and maybe decrease the amount you’ve “invested” or spend your bitcoin for a change, which helps with adoption.

Was looking for investment opportunities and a way to move funds around.  This friend Introduced me to Revolut (he used it as a loophole in Greece to avoid bank cash limit) and they offered a investment round, which I’ve used, but hit a glass wall to moving funds around.
One morning in May I was about to go to work and my father called me and while I walked through the living room and the radio was on and heard how bitcoin broke 1k. Something turned in my brains and thought this thing is still around..

Somehow we will require “safe houses” of some sort to store our bitcoin. Looking at how people got kidnapped and extorted.
A possible scenario could be depositing your cold storage device at the bank with some sort of 2-factor authentication . That you and the bank have, that in case you need extra BItcoin you could call or in a app of some kind to request and execute a transaction to your wallet.

Reports have shown that (large/serious) criminals move to the country side of the Netherlands for the simple fact that the cities are filled with police giving them the possibility to perform their crimes free of police.

It has 2 stage security.
A “seed” and “pincode”.
First time you set it up it will ask you to create a pincode and after that it will create a seed (which you have to write down).
In case someone gets their hands on it and they don’t know your pincode, then your safe, because if you lose it (for whatever reason for example theft) you will be able to reach your funds with any kind of software wallet by entering your seed code.
This device (ledger nano s) just adds a additional barrier of security to store your keys offline. 
Keeping your crypto currency on a exchange is a risk. Because if the exchange disappears or gets hacked you lose your coins.
Also keeping your crypto currency on a computer connected to the internet, makes it vulnerable to get hacked in order to steal for example your bitcoins. 
What makes it even better is the fact that you can even use it on computers that are hacked or infected with malware, because in order to authorize a transaction out of your wallet you have to press the 2 physical buttons on the ledger nano s.
Hope this helps
Ps: if someone gets a hold of your seed, then your in a lot of trouble (never ever share that)

Keep it to yourself and stay frugal.
Do Absolutely not start living above your normal needs and usual lifestyle.
I would say:
1. keep 10% in btc’s 
2. Cash the rest out and place on a savings account
3. Store away at least 200k for your child (college, university). Don’t buy stuf that lose its value like a car or boat, because maintenance costs a lot (remember to stay sober).
4. Don’t become a saint by donating and doing charity (once again stay sober and frugal)
5.  Seek professional financial advise. Large sums of wealth requires management and will be lost if mismanaged
By the way everything you buy and want to own, ask yourself if you can maintain and pay the costs with your normal job. Because a expensive house for example is expensive maintenance. A expensive car means expensive parts if something breaks.
Remember that you have a large sum of money and not a large some of continuous income. Every dollar spent means that it’s gone or will take your normal salary to cash back in.
Focus is key and professional advice won’t hurt.
You are now somebody who’s headache is how to maintain your wealth instead of getting your wealth.

@_date: 2019-01-25 01:21:20
I use a more subtle approach.
First I do not tell them I’m into crypto, because that would make me biased/blind.
I hear them out, hold my laugh and just listen to what they know. Then I say I don’t know anything really on the subject but what I read is what makes it special:
- proof of work, same as mining gold
- solution to Byzantine general problem
- something digital unable to be copied is priceless in a digital we already live in 
- borderless
- permissionless 
- LN network, more transactions then visa overtime
* importance here is to see which one of the points sparks interest 
Just make sure you tell just enough to make them interested and stop right when they start asking Detailed questions and say I read it in a article, which I could send you. B
Because I’m not really to knowledgeable/specialized on the subject. Do make sure you really share a quality article on the subject (please)
And if they come back hit them with “the bitcoin standard” and “Andreas antonopolous”

I truly believe bitcoin will rise exponentially and adoption will grow. Just imagine that bitcoin go’s bull in today’s circumstances, because buying it would be 10x more easier and convenient then last bull cycle (think bitcoin atms, coin star, binance Jersey, coinbase etc).
However right now everything sucks.

Your right but also wrong. 
The business model is changing drastically and car ownership is disappearing and could disappear completely. 
Owning a car isn’t sustainable for a growing world/country. Just look at finding a parking spot in most European countries (wasted space in my opinion). 
Mercedes, bmw  and Porsche are already giving lease plans to any kind of car for a fixed amount of money, which makes owning a specific car absolute. also the minerals wasted with every car produced isn’t sustainable.
Please read: 
Tesla is paving the way with it’s self driving fleet, which can be summoned in case you need to fast travel or travel a long distance (Uber competition) and car companies and Uber including are recognizing this threat and following with investing in this vision of Tesla.
How does this fit with bitcoin?
Why all the physical bank locations in a digital world. Why not be your own bank? I don’t have the answers but everything in the financial space will change due to the disruptive nature of bitcoin  as Tesla is doing with EV.
The world is changing and we have the honor to be in the midst of this change.

If otc volume is high meaning lots of buying is done and futures effect the market negatively.

Hopefully they’ll realize that in that case it’s better to have your keys privately stored. 
The not so tech savvy need to learn and you can’t assume everyone is as knowledgeable as you when it comes to this space. 
Also experience with banking is also a major influence. For example Greeks understand this due to sudden bank closings and holding funds hostage. 
In your case your knowledge of exchange hacks etc.
It all comes down to experience and personal preference and I think ABN is exploring the need for custodial services and to “bank” on bitcoin

Yes and the fact that banks can’t mess around with us anymore.
I think people are forgetting why crypto was invented, due to the banks and financial crisis that messed us up in 2007.

The last few weeks proves the opposite. Weak hands selling because of fud, banks blocking cc payments to crypto, negative regulation.

This is what you can do!
Download “Revolut” on your phone, here’s there website: 
(It’s a legit company and I can say that after 2 years of being a customer. )
Ask a friend of relative in Europe to app you the authentication number, because you will need to authenticate with a European number.
 After that transfer funds from your credit card to your revolut account. 
Download Coinbase on your phone and Sign up.
Now transfer the funds from revolut to your Coinbase account and your good to go ;)

Leave it there. I always had a lot of money when I was 16 buying designer crap and more. Now I’m 30 wishing I did some investments and hold on to for 10+ years. Believe me when I’m saying write that money of, because your young and you will have 1k many times after today.

I didn’t had that problem with them.

Sorry for that:
(Keep in mind that it’s behind a paywall and my free articles after opening is up)
However he is basically calling most ICO’s scams, which is fairly right in my opinion. Because it mimics the dot.com craz on how every website or company just had to be “online” to be a huge success without doing anything. 
It would be a shame if growth of bitcoin would get disrupted by these ICO’s.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:54:44
Fomo, yes because after 4 years this will be another missed opportunity. 
Remember that this technology is highly disruptive and because of that nature a giant in the making. Lambo, absolutely not because of my experience with luxury cars and maintenance I would never buy something like that again. A boat maybe, but high maintenance and also not worth it. Rather just rent it and leave ownership plus maintenance to the company

Could be. The majority of folks are still unaware of cryptos and let alone how to buy, save and spend it. Once it becomes more understandable that a beggar uses a deposit adress instead of a hat for fiat then we’re golden. Until then buy what you are willing to lose and don’t trade the future for the past
@_date: 2018-04-23 05:00:15
So is this just bcash or also other coins. It’s strange to me that most alts are recovering fast and BTC keeps struggling with 9k let alone passing 10k(this is a honest question)
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:24:22
There is a very old and wise saying in Dutch, which applies to the short term view. The saying go’s as following:

@_date: 2018-04-29 01:29:56
I do agree, however the future of currency will be in a digital form one way or another. Crypto currencies will evolve and become common as cashless societies is the undisputed future. Keep in mind that what makes cryptos valuable is the fact of having something digital and not able to duplicate it or fake its authenticity.
Bitcoin and many other currency will just become what fiat is without being centralized.
The speculation is the mere fact that the crypto you invest in will become the “most adopted and used” form of new fiat and in some cases it’s scarcity will be its intrinsic value

I’m a premium member and generally speaking positive on Revolut. But the way they handle crypto on their platform is ridiculous.
It’s more of a betting system in my opinion.
I honestly think they rushed this feature to stand out in the crowd hoping to catch new users, which actually didn’t do much for them due to poor execution.
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:16:54

It’s simple.
The man is heavily invested in banks and is actually buying more bank stocks, because his calculations show they will thrive in the years to come.
Now let’s assume this from another point of view.
Henry Ford is starting to mass produce his car and old Joe is doubling down on his horse business. Henry Ford is having issues selling his car, because the infrastructure/platform isn’t there yet i.e gas stations, mileage etc etc. Old Joe starts shouting “you see! Cars are for idiots”.
But while old Joe is being a noob the infrastructure is being build under his nose :)

I know that and my gut is telling we have enough room to go down (what I think). 
But long term I see us (2- 3 years) back around 20k ath, because of adaption and progress in the space.
Just look on github how etherium is developing. 
Hate block stream or not they are making progress. Bitcoin has a industry which has taken its place in the world and therefore not seeing it disappear soon. 
How do you see it happening die off like Napster?

Damn, that is painful. 
What made you think that it would go down all the way to today’s price and even 1k, what insights did you use or how did you evaluate while everyone went euphoric?
Also why slowsly climb in 2020 or die like Napster given the entire industry it has going for it in comparison to Napster just pirating music.
