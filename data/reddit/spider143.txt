Speaking relatively most of the Bitcoin users know how bitcoin works.

Not sure, but I heard Venezuelan government is hunting down miners. 
Is it safe?

Hyperinflation dude!.

In India, we are still stuck legalising cryptocurrency.

I am from India, and hars core supporter of cryptocurrency. 
India is banming the use of crypto because, India is currently dealing heavily with taxation issues. Many people here find new ways of avoiding tax and governments keep closing them. Now crypto has provided Indian a golden gate to avoid tax which cannot be closed ever. 
Secondly, Indian governments earn lot of revenues on sale of luxury goods. You will be taxed almost 100 percent on import of a BMW to India. Governments fear that if people start adopting these cryptos, they will lose revenue heavily. 
Nevertheless, I oppose our government's move to ban cryptocurrencies. If they are unable to collect taxes or generate revenue then it is there inability.

After the LTC reward was halved, the network hash rate has fell by almost 60% 
How will Bitcoin be effected?

Posting out my frustration here.
Unable to buy cryptos. I am from India but residing outside and India has virtual ban on cryptos. You cannot buy there.
I dont meet eKYC criteria of other countries to buy from there. 
Dont know what to do.

Exactly, any module that mines. I will set the difficulty the least, hence won’t need any hardware.

You can create in offline and without full  node. 
May be my English is bad, and couldn't interpret there properly. 
To create a raw transaction  I would only need UTXO from full node. I compose raw transaction on my mac book. The resultant hex I copy and paste on pages like
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:24:41
Tes ofcourse it is a hex string, but when parse the long hex, it returns you a more readable json. Although that json is not a raw transaction.

Raw transaction is transaction that is created without help of full node and completely offline. 
Raw transaction are very important when you have to securely store the private keys. You can create transaction on any device, take the sign transaction and broadcast it to public. 
A better example would be storing your private key on hand held device but that cannot host your full node. In this case you will have two options, one is connecting your device to a middleware/server which in turn connects to full node, which call the exchanges generally do. The other option is to create a transaction on the mobile itself and simply sending out the signed transaction. 
There are good number of libraries that can create a raw transaction. If you are new to this field PM me I will send you sample code that can do this.

No use. 
Your money is lost forever. Even coinbase cannot do anything about it.

The title itself seems doubtful. Difficulty and hash rate are directly correlated. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:20:35
The balance is 0 and not even transaction has been done/ received to/from that case.   
In this case the number of people who fell for this is 0.
