Biggest hurdle for me are the people who are in the space for get quick rich scheme and nothing to do with technology. Seriously this speculative trading shitshow needs to stop.

Bitcoin is officially out of early technology phase, whole world is aware of bitcoin now.

That's good so more hopes that they will implement lightning network too if and when it becomes fully functional.

I don't get why people are using exchanges when the true vision if crypto is decentralisation

Clearly there are atleast two types of people in this space one for getting quick rich and others for the technological revolution and/or financial freedom from centralized authorities. Also there are many who are in middle and are in for both. If you read my PS you can see that I have clearly mentioned for whom this question is.

dream of most of crypto investors is to have a s much free time as possible

@_date: 2018-04-14 14:42:49

Atleast read the whole question, if you are not in for gains obviously you would not sell your whole bunch. I specifically said this question was for those who want to sell there bitcoin for gains.
