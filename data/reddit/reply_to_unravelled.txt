Yes, on how to store btc, just like the title says.

To be honest, bitcoin right now is not working. There is a huge back log, and some people have waited as long as 10 days to get a transaction through and some paid up to $100 from a single transaction to make sure it got through fast. 
Anyway, the company Blockstream (owners of r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org and paymaster to several Bitcoin Core Devs) has been advocating for this situation for about two years now because they have a patent on a set of code that "fixes" just such a problem.

So, Bitcoin does not work right now, there is no good way to get bitcoin, and for the forseeable future there is no solution except to dump the "core" team an switch to one of the other dev teams (like Bitcoin un - limit  - ed). 
Good luck

Wat? We *need* a backlog? Is that like how the grocery story *needs* there to always be a line?

Amazing! I am pretty sure this is illegal in Japan (where his company is), I can't belike they allow open bribery like this?

When did you buy into Eth. I'm thinking about selling BTC for Eth until core finishes with UASF successfully in the next couple months.
