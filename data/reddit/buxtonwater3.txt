Tfw I live in London can finally sell my home for 37.5 bitcoins

Your first point only harks onto the idea that Bitcoin is the most popular crypto - and that’s only because it is the first. A developmental ecosystem isn’t unique to bitcoin, nor is it the fact that it is “innovative”, if both points were applicable bitcoin would not be where it’s at now.

“Due to popularity”
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:05:39
It’s not spam. These fee threads are only displaying a “glaring” flaw in your currency and you can only sweep it under the rug so much. Until this changes bitcoin is nothing more than an overhyped asset with little real world use - as this goes on “hodling” will in itself become more and more of a risky proposition.

This will probably clear things up
And I’m assuming that the exchange covered the fees for you, the other transaction must be pure luck.

Bitcoin could either be the Nokia of mobile phones or the Mercedes of automobiles - so far we can’t tell but I’m starting to err on the side of the former unless developers start upping their game.

I've been in his community for a good 3 months and it went from all hail Bitcoin our lord and saviour, to "it's okay guys just keep believing in our lord Satoshi", to fuck this I'm cashing out, then reverse order, and then back again to this.
Love you guys

When I first started getting into the world of bitcoins, maybe a couple months ago, it was £700. I'd love to make a large investment asap.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:05:40
The recent events may have seemed discouraging since youve JUST got into Bitcoin, whereas I joined the Bitcoin scene 3 months ago when it was just below £700, then it short up to £1100 which excited the shit out of me, now it's back down at just above £800. This is normal, and has been one hell of a ride since I've been into it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:28:08
Very well said 
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:23:07
My point exactly
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:16:46
I’m holding mine on Revolut, which only allows the storing of Bitcoin but payments and receipts have to converted to the virtual £ and € current accounts they generate for you. It also has Apple Pay and physical mastercards. 
Does this count as a vulnerable exchange like Coinbase for example? 
Edit; just reread what you said, not your keys not your coins. Revolut doesn’t ��.... may the self loathing intensify :) 
I bought too early and already lost %20 of what I put in. I’m gonna carry on keeping it but maybe I should migrate my bitcoins to a proper wallet key like right now?

You guys need to allow for custom fees. Forcing me to pay £3.99 for a transaction is lame af

It says ELI5, clearly OP had a hard time understanding from previous posts and it's not hard to see why
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:39:33
Re-read your post before saying anything is stupid. There are many better ways to phrase your question without being subject to "smart ass"

Oh no guys sell immediately
