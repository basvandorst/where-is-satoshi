He did answer a similar question a while back, I'll cross post it here for you for the info:
"TAiS46 2 points 17 days ago
Bitcoin-24 is alive over a year.
If you are interested, how we earn money and finance the project:
* Same-Day Option - We withdraw your EUR on the same day you made the withdraw. We earn 1% and have a lot of this transactions / day
* Donations - If you take a look than you see, that there are a lot people donating
* Parcel DHL - About 40-50 EUR per Parcel fee. About 2 / week
Thats enough for pay the Server and IT stuff and all!
I build up BTC24 not or earning money! I will support Bitcoin and this is my goal. To give the EU and a little bit of the rest a chance, to exchange they Bitcoin for free.
Hope thats enough for the first :)"
So it's not like it's non-profit lol

I tried logging in... using user: nicetryatscamming pass: butitwontworkonme
It gave me:
"Your account is not yet converted to engine 2.0 . 
We are doing our best to speed up the process. 
Please wait for a few hours and try again. 
You are always free to make a donation on  1La9STtdWyCACATkJSenX4doYUunWHe3of  and get VIP treatment."
They even try to get you to send donations it seems lol... Not to mention (I guess?) that username and pass don't exist...

I hope you get the "go" from your lawyer soon!
As much as I am upset about not being able to withdraw my BTC, I do realize it's not like you guys have an SLA (Service Level Agreement) or something. Shit happens. 
I hope you get it sorted out soon. Good luck fixing the engine, seems like that could be hard (though I'm not a programmer so I wouldn't know for sure).
Unlike some, I am pretty much convinced that we will get our money/BTC back. It's just a hunch, but something tells me I can trust BTC-24, it's the reason I signed up with it in the 1st place. If BTC-24 has losses it can't cover yet, it sure will be when it comes up again. And like some said, if you'd have wanted to take our money, you probably would've done so ages ago, and definitely hadn't posted your name n address and all... Just my two cents.
Good luck, I wish you all the best, and I hope to see BTC-24 back online ASAP.

Please speak for yourself!
I for one would like it to be restarted, as long as the bug gets fixed. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.
