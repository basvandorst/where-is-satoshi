Maybe in America. In Europe everybody I know just saw it as a means of enabling obesity, one doomed to fail as it involves standing up. The rascal on the other hand, it even has a basket you can keep snacks in while you watch Honey Boo Boo.

Nah, they just lacked vision like a lot of people. At the time they saw mp3 as nothing more than a way to listen to music on a PC, which only a few actually owned or had much interest in. They responded to my attempts to explain where mp3 could go and what it could lead to by calling it science fiction and much like futurists are constantly labelled as delusional, they saw me as a fantisist. Plenty of people view nascent tech as something that exists in a state of stasis, as opposed to something evolutionary. Take crypto for example, plenty of people I know point to issues that exist today as if there's no room for further development. Any attempt to project future implications will be relegated similarly to the realm of science fiction until they feel mainstream consensus allows them to accept it without running the risk of looking foolish. Then they will claim they were always in the know and deny that they said it was all stupid. Lack of effort to understand, born from a fear of straying from consensus and a fear of looking foolish.

I remember excitedly demonstrating mp3 on my Sonique player to a bunch of my pals back in the day, only to be told it was retarded and by extension so was I. They all held firm in that position, even when I presented the Rio player to them. It wasn't until Apple's marketing dept did a number on them that they went into a frenzy for Mp3. They also denied ever saying the tech was useless; while asking me how to put mp3 on their iPods.
