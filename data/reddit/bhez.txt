Thank you!
Bitpay's recent change to use payment protocol only has caused some problems for me.  I'm guessing they did it to avoid people sending BCH to a BTC address and vice/versa. But they won't tell me what address to send the payment to!  I click their payment protocol link in the browser and it opens an extra instance of the Bitcoin Core wallet which doesn't know where I have my datadir.  I ended up using electrum to make the payment, I was able to paste in the URI to the to: address and it filled it all in for me.  I was left unable to use coin control to choose which address the payment came from, and the ability to choose the fee was way too limited in electrum.
Your payment protocol interface should solve my problems, again, thank you.

I didn't mind the older text-mode apple computers ][e or whatever they were; I could put in a 5.25" floppy disk and write BASIC programs and save them to my own disk, but the newer Macs with OS4 or whatever they had, I hated those. They were really slow and locked down so we can only them for Clarisworks (word processor &amp; spreadsheet program) and for Kid Pix.  Then the computer lab got 2 IBM-compatible computers (a 286 and a 386) that had DOS 5 or 6 and windows 3.1 on them.  Those were a pleasure to use.  I brought in a few floppies of a few DOS &amp; windows shareware games from home and loaded them to these PC's hard drives and all the other kids from all the computer classes thanked me for providing something entertaining to do while in the computer lab.

How do you rebroadcast in common wallets?  By sending again?  What if after you rebroadcast, the original transaction also goes through? Would that mean you have sent twice as much?

In Electrum, you can mark the paper wallet address as 'do not spend' so that address will only be shown in your electrum wallet for seeing the balance.

Coinbase would probably not know what to do with BTC sent to one of their one-time addresses multiple times, so it would probably end up in coinbase's general fund of lost transactions.

I took my 12 word electrum seed and punched it into these 3 metal plates.
Image from before the actual words were stamped on: 
So that I can put them in 3 different places where no one else can get the entire key together while I'm still alive.  And if I die, it will only take my family any 2 out of 3 of these plates to recreate the seed and retrieve my BTC savings.
This example shows how it might work if then mnemonic is **one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve**:
The 12 words are split into 3 sections of 4 words each.  Each of the 3 plates has 2 sections, so 8 out of 12 words, leaving 4 words unknown.  If any 2 plates are in the same place, the entire 12 word seed can be reassembled and typed into an Electrum client.
I just have to be careful that as long as I'm alive, no one else ever sees and photographs / writes down / memorizes the words from any of these plates.  I can keep one in a safety deposit box at a bank, another one given to relatives that I want to have my BTC savings after I die, and another one, say, in an undisclosed location that only I know about.  If any of those 3 is found (stolen), the thief trying to get the remaining 4 words of the seed wouldn't know where to find either of the other 2 plates.  If I die, the bank safety deposit box gets opened and contents revealed to my relatives who already have the other plate, at which point they can have my BTC savings.
And if I'm still alive and my house burns down destroying all my computers AND somehow I forget the logins to where I have backup copies of my wallet, I still know where each of these metal plates are so that I can just get any 2 of them, install Electrum to a new computer, and recover my BTC savings.

in the "receive" tab of the wallet program, each time you use it to request btc, it gives you a new receiving address so that for every time you ask for money from different people/services they can all get different receiving addresses from you.
by receiving btc, it doesn't change any addresses; it is by going to that tab that lets you get additional addresses to have people send money to.
Of course you don't have to do it that way.  once a receiving address is created in your receive tab, you can re use that address to receive btc as many times as you'd like, from multiple people if you wish.  That's just not generally recommended for mostly privacy reasons.  One use for it would be to put one btc address you own in your signature of a forum where many people can potentially donate to you.

I used a die set to hammer the words from my 12 word electrum seed into 3 aluminum plates.
Well each of the 3 plates has a different set of 8 out of 12 words, so that the whole seed can easily be reconstructed by anyone with any 2 out of 3 plates.
I then keep one plate in my house, another in my parents' house, and one more in a safety deposit box which there will be a mention in my will that my parents will get access to that safety deposit box.

May I make a suggestion, to be on the safe side:
[choose your wallet]( - install a wallet program, then transfer your tip to an address controlled by your wallet program.  This will keep your tip stored inside your wallet file on your computer, encrypt your wallet with a password, make backups of that file, make sure no one else gets access to those backups. (I know it's a lot of effort, but you may have put lots of bitcoin in that wallet in the future and you want to protect it from loss &amp; theft)
The reason - is because anyone that has ever had their hands on that piece of paper may have secretly snapped a photo of it and at a later time can take that money if you don't do it first.  Or the guy that left it for you, even with good intentions to gift that to you, might have made a mistake that he accidentally kept the private key and accidentally spends it at a later time.  Or any number of things like that could happen.

Shouldn't ads be served on a pre-paid basis? When the pre-paid funds run out, the website or ad network stops running the ad until they prepay more.  No public embarrassment when there is no money in the account to host the ad, they just run different paying ads in their place.  I've used Google AdWords and that is how they operate.

Coinbase works fine, and I actually like them.
I just didn't call them a *real* exchange because they oversimplify it for you.  Just buy at current price, or sell at current price.
They don't give you any more advanced options for those who want more control, such as the ability to set a buy or sell price and quantity to execute when the price reaches that amount.  I think it is for that reason that coinbase is not listed in [bitcoincharts](

If you try to send to an invalid address, the transaction just will not happen.
If you send to an address of which you don't who it belongs to, then there is likely no way of finding out who to ask to send your money back.  And they probably won't know who sent it.  It would be a nice anonymous donation to the person receiving the payment.  They can send it back to the address of which it came, but they don't know for sure if doing that actually pays you the original sender back, or if that money gets lost at an online wallet service.  (for more info read about what happens if someone uses their coinbase online wallet to send directly to satoshi dice for gambling.  The winnings don't get paid back to their coinbase online wallet; the winnings go to coinbase itself.)
And finally if you send to an address which the owner of that address has permanently lost the private key, then that amount of bitcoin has basically gone into a black hole, never to be used by anyone ever again.
I have lost several bitcoins a couple of weeks ago.  I pasted the wrong address from the clipboard and sent it to someone whom I don't know who they are or how to contact them.  So it is lost forever to me, but the person who received it will get to spend it.  In fact they have already transferred it out of that address and into another address that I assume they control.  If only I knew who I sent them to, I could ask for it back, but no, those bitcoins are lost forever for me.
@_date: 2013-08-25 11:27:47
I'm pretty sure Paypal would still hold you liable for the charged-back funds and could take you to court to get that money back.  But it may be easier to prove to the court that you sent the bitcoins than it would be to otherwise get Paypal to accept the same thing.

Pretty helpful explanation.
It just overstates the part about the untraceable anonymous transactions.  They are very easily traceable as all transactions are public.  Blockchain.info makes it pretty easy.  It is generally considered anonymous because for any given bitcoin address you generally don't know what person or entity it belongs to.  Some of which you can find who they belong to by using Google.  So not completely anonymous, and very easily traceable through blockchain.info or through searching the blockchain records that exist on every full bitcoin node.
