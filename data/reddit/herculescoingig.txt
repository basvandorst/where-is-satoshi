I submitted an Amazon gift card a good 3-4 weeks ago that still hasn't been paid.  Have you guys resumed payouts?

$5...the same amount approved six previous times.  Am I still unverified?

I'm on the east coast of the US and just learned about BTC in the last month.  I have 0-5BTC.  Open to any questions you may have......

Looks good!  Any chance a leaderboard is in the works?

Maybe add a Top 10 or Top 25 list of account values?  Would add some competition as almost everyone will want to be the best BTC trader!
Looks great so far!

Mr. Moneybags is in the building.  The world needs more people like this putting smiles on the faces of so many.  Very well done.

Just saw your questions to Dillpicklechips so here goes:  I bought increments of BTC off eBay when I could find some that were NOT significantly marked up to market value (rare on eBay).  I don't have many but will need more info on how to buy.  Maybe I'll just get on Mt. Gox unless there are better places to buy that anyone could recommend??
