Yawn. The government can't shut down BTC even if they wanted to. Piss off you government stooge.

You are trying to put words into my mouth. This fuckwad, jOhnqd03, has the attitude that the Bitcoin "community" needs to be perfect so we can silently tip toe around and not arise the ire of big daddy government. It is the logic and thinking of a child. Imagine 5 year old children playing with something and having fun. Then one child gets hurt and the adults ban that activity for all children. I haven't supported anything yet except for not thinking like a child.

No fuck you for being a cowardly cunt for letting the idea that the state is above you enter your mind. Oh no, one person shot someone else with a gun. I guess that means no guns for anyone. Should we remove dollars because people steal and commit fraud with dollars? No? Then quit being a stupid fuck.

Except that the banks are insolvent anyway. Another crash will destroy the banks and people will flock to an alternative legal or not. You're a government shill.

So I guess Kim Dotcom ruined file sharing after his arrest? No, torrents had their biggest year in 2013. YOU get real.

Firefox OS! I am excited by it, but no native programming option is bad in my opinion. I know the Mozilla Foundation wants to keep the web open, but come on, this is a mobile phone, it needs native code.

Work is actually being done to acquire bitcoin, unlike the U.S. dollar.

The US military is also a large reason for the "value" of the dollar. Support the troops! :)

Blackberry is probably the only realistic option at this point for a mobile provider. Encryption, the phones can run Android apps, I think writing apps is fairly straightforward with Qt.

You really haven't said anything that isn't obvious. England used tally sticks for centuries because everyone agreed it was money. The work thing highlights one difference between fiat dollars and bitcoin. There is a limit to bitcoin and no limit to the amount of dollars the FED enters into its computers. Also, no one will use bitcoin as a day to day currency as long as the price continues to rise. They will treat it as gold or silver. The price needs to stabilize before bitcoin becomes viable for day to day use. Why buy a sandwich with bitcoin if those same bitcoins will be worth more later by sitting on them?

Sony is supposed to release a high end Firefox OS phone in 2014.

I really hope that Apple gets hit with anti-competitive monopoly charges. They need to be forced to open up a bit. Android kinda blows but at least you can run whatever software on it that you want. The next best option is a Blackberry Z10? Encryption, I can run my own software, Android apps, c++ instead of shitty Java.

Obviously. What is your point?
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:09:27
I assumed it was the work that is being performed to obtain bitcoin and the network effect around it. What else could give it value? The fact that only 21 million will ever be created?
