You missed one of my questions.


If you can make an account with a fake username then a suspect's account might not reveal anything about his possession of laundered money. Of course, if evidence of payment from his own bank account to wherever he bought the bitcons from exists, then he can be caught, but I doubt anyone would be stupid enough to transfer laundered money to his own bank account. More likely it would be used to buy bitcoins immediately. Do you disagree?

Wow. Your analogy is so complex, abstract, accurate and sensible that I don't understand it at all.
Just throw aside how you haven't even touched any of my points.


You don't give any counter arguments for my arguments. I'm not going to bother.


You know I actually like the idea of cryptocurrencies. A few things irk me like the anonymity and how their prices are largely affected by people who want to get rich quick, but I think cryptocurrencies are a good idea.
And I wouldn't feel any worse if you gave me reasons why it's not good for money laundering. Heck I'd learn. But you haven't. And choosing to see me as a person who wants bitcoin to be a good avenue for money-laundering is just mistaken.
You can say "the fact is it's not", but that's all you're saying. I might as well say "the fact is rainbow unicorns exist".

Practically all forms of money laundering are traceable in one way or the other. My point was that bitcoin might provide an avenue that's even harder than tracking a bank account. Since it's separate from the real world, the CIA wouldn't know where to start if they had no strong leads (bank accounts are opened in people's/organization's names, but a bitcoin account doesn't need to be). Payments in pure bitcoin most probably can't be as easily traced. And if it becomes more widely accepted then the problem would only get worse.
Also, what if you **aren't** the target of an investigation?

Are you an average person?

You really haven't proven this to me yet. Also, you just agreed with me in your third line (albeit with conditions). Finally, you aren't a money laundering expert so I'm not sure if I can just trust you when you haven't listed many reasons for me to. I'm not denying you because I'm afraid of being wrong, it just seems like that from my observations.


You haven't done much arguing over its traceability, just reiterated that it's traceable (without addressing how payments made in bitcoin can be traced or how the CIA can trace a person if they don't know where to start or how, even, a person that channels laundered money directly to bitcoin can be caught).


Hmm if you were a money laundering expert I'd trust that last statement, but you aren't and haven't given many reasons to so...


I probably don't know as much about bitcoin as you. But you haven't done a very thorough job of convincing me that it isn't a better avenue for money laundering. I was willing to be convinced out of my position, but that didn't happen. So you understand it's difficult for me to "get over it" when there isn't much reason to apart from your (a non-money laundering expert's) "word".

Replying late because I have exams and haven't been on reddit for a while.


You pretty much said the opposite of this earlier when you were like:  "*You don't even know how to LEGALLY launder money*."
But I digress. That doesn't have much to do with my main point.
Me or you not having the necessary knowledge to regard ourselves as money launderers can be put aside. We're on the internet so we can see how money laundering can or can not be done with the aid of cryptocurrency. To reiterate, my point is that bitcoin, through its potential powers of anonymity can provide a way for money launderers to more easily store funds without passing through any financial institution that can record the passage of said funds. Money laundering being restricted to rich people or not is not important to the argument. My point is that it can be performed.


This isn't exactly an argument but you just listing alternative methods. Enlightening, but not as relevant.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:24:41


Oh, I didn't know this. But that wasn't where I was coming from. What I mean is this:
The public ledger has no names listed, right? Just account codes unless I'm mistaken. So assuming you were to launder money through it, the government wouldn't have anywhere to start. It could have thousands of accounts that received similar amounts of money in the same time-frame. Also, can't you create an account with a fake name? Or are there legal proceedings involved?
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:59:03
But how would the government know it's you when numerous similar transactions might take place in the same time-frame? Also how would they know your account when everything's anonymous?
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:03:57


I see you're angry, but this is a strawman.


Nope. There's no need for all of that. Laundered cash can be exchanged, gradually over time for bitcoin **directly**. There's no need to go through the financial system, and be tracked in any way. The fact that you can access this money anywhere and anytime also adds to the appeal.
Two: if you have an offshore account, you can use it to buy the bitcoins from the foreign country with your laundered money before spending it in your home country. Less need to tie it to fake businesses, charities and the like. And as I said before, as bitcoin becomes more widely accepted (if it does), this will grow in appeal.
Three (this isn't exactly money laundering but more of fraud) is how credit cards can be used. I'll quote someone.


But this might not apply in the US since I hear credit card companies have been banning payments made for bitcoin. Regardless, there are many other countries that haven't done so.
Four: Using [cryptocurrency tumblers]( in the middle of the process.


I'm just going to skip this because I gave four possible alternatives, and so it doesn't have to be this way. If even one is viable then I've proven my point. I feel like I can retort to this, but that would be somewhat redundant.


Oh, come on. That's just incorrect. I've pointed out reasons why I think bitcoin may be easier to launder money through right from my second reply. I was even asking you to prove me wrong.


Well that's sounds strange, doesn't it? Deliberately *not* explaining stuff because someone *doesn't* know. 
I do know of the dark web, VPNs (I use one) and government spying (at least in America, not my country though, I think our government's too stupid [I just realized that this might come off as cocky, but really, they are]). I'd say making assumptions is kind of unfair, don't you think?


No no no, you aren't explaining stuff wrong. You just aren't explaining at all.


Um, last time I checked (which is right now) money laundering was illegal. A federal crime in the USA, I believe. Maybe I missed your meaning?


I don't think I'm smart. If I recall correctly, from the beginning, I was asking *you*, the more bitcoin-savvy person, questions. And forgive me for not trusting a random person on the internet who is not a money-launderer or financial crimes prosecutor, over numerous sources.


Don't tell me you haven't ever had a dummy email address? I have like two.


You just spoke of VPNs. Also your computer doesn't need to have your personal details.


That's not what I thought "trust me" meant. But okay, duly noted.

Go to my last post from three days ago. You'll see that I came up with very easy ways to bypass the things that you called "not-anonymous".
I misread one of your arguments in that case (I thought you said "e-mail" but you said "the mail") but I can still provide a way to bypass that. If you rent a hotel/motel/apartment room then you can use the address of said place. What stops you from doing that? Also does every single bitcoin exchange (I assume this is where you register?) require you to use the mail? What about those in foreign countries (I stay in a third world country and our mailing system is nonexistent but I know people with bitcoins)? With computers you can use a VPN to scramble your location/identity (or you can even use a public cafe). So yeah, I might be pretty ignorant right now (assuming these things have answers) but that's because instead of arguing and listing points to convince me, you've been ranting at me for not swallowing every single thing you say (you, a random person on the internet) and for not regarding everything I've seen elsewhere online as trash (with you being the sole source of truth).


Answered above.


1) Why is this so?
2) What stops a rich person with numerous resources from having the means to do this?
3) **"Nightmare" does not mean impossible.**


This isn't my main argument against this, but I just thought of it now. You can use the art and charities you mentioned earlier to claim/clean the money.
But my main points against this are that (1) As bitcoin becomes more acceptable, a person might be able to spend this money directly as bitcoins more easily and (2) Assuming you pay with bitcoins through a proxy you can spend the money while removing yourself from the equation.
So that's three points in total. Please answer to them.


How genuinely acerbic.
Just kidding. You getting annoyed because I try to write in a brief but non-repetitive way that captures all my thoughts and arguments is ridiculous.
