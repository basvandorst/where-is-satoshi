Maybe one aspect to consider is the possibility to locally and even automatically execute cryptocurrency payments, without trusting any online service. It could lower the cognitive threshold to donating. As a lazy human being, I find little motivation make the effort to donate to more than a few projects I find important, like libreoffice and wikipedia. Personally I'd find it convenient if I could allocate a certain amount of money per year, to be automatically distributed to all the free software projects that I use.

Thanks! Apart from changetip, are there other tipping systems using some other kind of mechanism? Any decentralised way of tipping?

Please don't. Can I still reverse the thought?

I wonder if they have considered using some cryptocurrency with faster confirmations.

Wow, that's smart! However the transaction cost is still significant for small payments.

Is Micropayments an off-chain system? Could you give me a link? I'm interested

I think trust (linked to an identity) is much more valuable than any currency. Personal trust is the ultimate currency, and most certainly is no pollution.

This problem could possibly be solved with a bitcoin [solution]( Lots of projects go unnoticed intill they run out of money, while this solution could give them a steady (but small) flow.

Thanks for loving it :-)
I also think that the importance of simplicity/convenience cannot be overlooked.
This system should work with any distro or software, as it actually only defines a few standards: ship lots of bitcoin addresses and pay automatically. Open, decentralized systems at its best.
