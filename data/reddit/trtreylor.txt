The part with the URL that has the actual privatekey right before the wallet.dat part, that is something that should not be able to be seen.  The wallet is supposed to generate offline and not on their server.  All wallet generators always generate stuff offline.  I run  and it also generates offline.  If that was me getting a key from that site I would've looked @ the source code.  Sadly a poor guy lost 18.5 bitcoins now worth $300K to those thieves! looks like they shut down before a year though, but that is still long enough for them to steal lots of Bitcoins.  
To make matters worse they used Blogspot domain which is Google owned and ranks very high in search results, so they took advantage of natural search traffic!

Anytime you are getting any kind of paperwallet from any website, you should scan the code for anything suspicious.  But people are often lazy and just go at it without thinking through!

Sure sounds more like theft to me!
Have you ever seen a site that generates a wallet URL with the Private key in the URL? You realize that can also get indexed by Google Bot if it happens to catch on!  Use your common sense, you see the evidence, it is obvious!

They love misery and don't do research before they signup to something.  That is where problem lies.
