Bitstamp also has Segwit already, they're not playing politics they're trying to improve bitcoin.

FUD boys jerkin off to Tethers again with no evidence of anything wrong to try and shakeup BTC, practice as usual.

I have talked to a bunch, conservative ones say yes, standard answer is no, don't really need to at this point.  So take an extra cautious approach or not up to you, but like others say you should talk to someone yourself.

The shills want cheap knockoffs cuz they feel they missed the boat.

Bitstamp first, Gemini next.

Lightning is on mainet and close, when that works well it will knockout the need for most alts, too many wannabe Bitcoins out there that haven't even tested scaling issues, going to be glorious.

So I sent old coins I bought to Gemini to cashout to fiat over 20k, that shouldn't affect me?

Thanks.  Ok I just got Multibit HD.  Going to create a new wallet do all the phrase and password stuff, write down all the info, create multiple backups.   
Then, like I said earlier if for some crazy reason Multibit HD goes down or under or whatever, can I restore my bitcoins from that backup onto another client?
Or do I have to do the WIF technique now if I want to recover it later? Some of that stuff sounds confusing for a noob, like "Perform SHA-256 hash on the extended key"
Just trying to do all this the right way, and make sure I can obviously restore the wallet.

I tried asking about this before but didn't get a whole lot of info.  I'm going to make a physical backup Multibit HD but also want to make a seed paper.  Can I just write down the phrase and the date and that's enough if for some reason my physical backup gets lost?

Ya I meant electrum, I guess it just worries me if multibite ever goes under and doesn't work, I won't have access to my bitcoins?
