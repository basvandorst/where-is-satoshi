So SegWit adoption is a big deal for BTC right now, isn't it? Is it likely, though?

I thought the whole point of crypto was doing it better than banks

I bought a low amount precisely because i wanted to learn, and the best way to learn is doing it from your own experience. I just didn't expect to be robbed like that, for a technology that claimed to be fast and cheap.

Then what's the point of this thread? Blockchain is a technology. Bitcoin is a currency based on Blockchain. Excuse me if I'm missing something, but it sure seems to me like Blockchain can still exist even if Bitcoin disappears.

I don't know the answers to that, this was about a month ago, i wanted to get into crypto and of course Bitcoin was the thing i had heard about, so i bought like $70 in BTC from Coinbase, and sent it to my new wallet (i don't know why i would want to do that, but whatever).
The transaction took about 4 hours and they charged me $34. I thought "what's this shit, i'm gonna sell all my BTC and buy another coin with lower fees", because i wanted to trade, etc.
But when i tried to send my BTC back to my Coinbase wallet, a message told me i had insufficient funds because the fees were about 85% of the quantity i wanted to move. 
So i left my BTC there and bought some more coins, this time ETH, and waited so the fees became lower.
About two weeks ago i sent my remaining $20 in BTC (because of course i was hit by the January crash), and chose the kind of transaction with lower fees and longer wait time.
I'm really a noob and i guess i paid the price, but all i know is i bought $70 in BTC and i only got ~$6 back.
Not planning to buy BTC again, to be honest, and i **really** get why Starbucks wouldn't want to touch it with a ten feet pole.

Thanks for your answers and your time :D

I'm out of the loop, can somebody explain to me what segwit is and if that's what made him pay only $1 in fees?
Because i moved my BTC two times (to and from my wallet), and the fees were $34 and $14. Sold my bitcoin and i'm not planning on buying again unless fees drop *a lot*

Thanks, that was helpful.
Just a follow-up: Why is the network less congested now? Is it because people started to hold instead of trade or because there's fewer people holding BTC? I mean, the decline in price BTC is facing (appart from the crash) tells me people got tired of high fees and wait times, am I onto something here?
