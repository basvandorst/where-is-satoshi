There is no need.  Bitcoins are almost infinity divisible.

Far-leftest turn to the completely made up US dollar.

No.  Bitcoin is a digital asset that people may want to purchase.  It is more like property or gold.

Seems that banks are not a safe place to keep money. They collude with governments, who specialize in separating the citizenry from their possessions

I'm not happy that people have lost money, but if it dips down a bunch, I'll buy some more.

The "value" of Bitcoin is not in the mining, but in it's use as a currency.  Mining will continue to process the transactions and the miners will be paid by transaction fees.

The block chain can still be used to sign documents, and that may create transactions, but wouldn't you have to have some of the lost bitcoin to provide a transaction fee?

You have a good point.  Although I like bitcoin and have some myself, it is heavily reliant on infrastructure and that is a vulnerability.  Without your private key, a consensus about the blockchain and miners, your SOL.  Not a good hedge in case of SHTF.

Same as if someone bought all the gold in the world and "misplaced" it.  The loser would be out - a lot, but everybody that sold their bitcoins would have whatever they sold for.  The miners would likely stop working, since there would be no transactions to process.
