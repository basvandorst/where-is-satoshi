Hi , does anyone know how to start a business like this ? So basically these are paper wallets pre loaded with different amounts of bitcoin say $50,$100, etc. 
However my question is : is these someone's bitcoin ? Or is this like ATM where you buy from the exchange ? 
How much would anyone need to start something like this ?
