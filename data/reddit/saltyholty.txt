It's unfair if you get bumped because some guy came in and bribed the guy for your spot.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:33:56


Why would that happen?
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:01:10


@_date: 2018-05-27 10:25:17
Only people who bribe are fun.
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:34:58
Scarcity will cause deflation.
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:44:04
Where would you have predicted the price to be right now if you'd predicted in December?
@_date: 2018-06-04 00:44:31
Can you seriously not see the obvious irony? Try looking up the book I made up.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:36:32
I didn't say that. It might drop even more tonight. It might drop below $5800 in the next 15 minutes. But it hasn't yet, so don't pretend it has.
If the facts have you so convinced it is going to fail, then share the facts. You don't need to lie.

We cured earth roundness generations ago. Read "Don't fall off the edge: why cancer is the tits." by Humplegrump McGee. Wake up.
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:05:34


Does it?
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:22:55
That's not the figure I'm seeing... I'm seeing $5940.
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:33:25
If my auntie had a dick she'd be my uncle.
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:05:34
Them: But you were buying six months ago, not selling.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:50:58
Was your salary x bitcoin per month, or $x per month in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:18:17
It's not gone below $5800.
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:52:30
Them: Didn't you only get into it six months ago?
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:28:34
Ok, but it's not been as low as you are pretending, the first or the second time, at all today.
It's dropped around 3 points today. Not good, but you don't need to pretend it is 5 points.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:52:34
Google it you lazy fuck.
@_date: 2018-06-04 00:36:30
I don't know what you mean. I was just piling on.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:20:29
Good night, sleep tight, don't loose sleep.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:21:28
Are you a native speaker?
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:21:09
Did you ever find the shirts?
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:48:03
Well I didn't ask you mate.
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:32:21
No it isn't. You seem to be confused between what you would like to be true and what is.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:47:59
You know, the majority of the most educated people in the world .. ?
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:29:47
I would and did call it stupid. If people didn't know that money comes from somewhere they'd be too stupid to breathe, and you know it.
People don't support redistribution because they're morons, but because they like it. That's democracy. They don't not know that those with the most will pay the most, they know that and they like it.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:23:44
They'll continue to sell what is produced.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:15:38
It's ridiculous because that's not what anyone wants to offer. Let's have people vote on what is on offer, like we have been doing, and keep seeing how popular redistributive policies are. Very.
It's perfectly democratic to vote to obligate people to pay for the welfare of others. You're pretending not to know what democracy is again.
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:26:32
Buy the dip!
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:19:43
People aren't half as stupid as you need them to be.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:31:24
Then you're not thinking.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:20:54
That's democracy for you.
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:04:39
That's annualised inflation.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:05:13
I'm well familiar with democracy. You've forgotten that it is you pretending not to know what it is.
I don't have to hold a ridiculous poll like that, people vote for redistributive policies all the time. They're very popular.
Every man for himself is not democracy, nor is it popular.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:34:14
Again, people aren't half as stupid as you need them to be. I don't think even you are stupid enough to believe they are. I think you're lying.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:56:44
If you don't buy and it takes off to 20k like last year, you'll regret it. If you do buy and when the FOMO wears off it plummets back to 5.8k as last time, you'll regret it.
Gamble if you want, and never more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:39:01
The demos is wider than just the taxpayers. People vote collectively for things that they wouldn't necessarily choose individually. Like welfare.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:54:35
The best guess is the price today is perfectly understandable. Any normal person understands the idea of a guess, and that it isn't saying exactly the same as the guess.
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:18:09
Basically that rule is there to make sure banks stay solvent. It isn't there to limit, in most cases, the amount they lend.
The amount they lend is limited by the demand for loans, and the viability of those loans, as you would want. 
You wouldn't want a situation where a business needs a loan, and has a decent prospect of paying it back, but can't get one.
You also wouldn't want a situation where there is an artificial scarcity of money, such as with bitcoin, meaning the cost of the loan was driven up by the scarcity of lenders and not down by the ability to repay the loan.
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:39:54
Why you being such a cunt?
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:31:30
That's just stupid. You should just buy the bitcoin in that case.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:22:45


@_date: 2018-04-10 21:52:27
No it doesn't dipshit. It means today's price is the *best guess* for tomorrow's price. You know how you could have known it meant that? By reading it.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:03:37
I didn't have to. The first post undermined your argument before you made it. The best guess for tomorrow's price isn't equivalent to tomorrow's price, ergo, the price can and will still change.
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:49:07
Then borrow as much money as you can and buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:04:24
Will it still have been a mystery if it is one day discovered that it is a guy called Satoshi Nakamoto, and he is otherwise unremarkable?
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:13:44
Yes it is.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:25:53
Will it? Or is that us finding out that it was never a mystery in the first place?
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:48:37
The best guess for the price tomorrow is the price today.
If the buyers thought it was going to be vastly cheaper tomorrow, they wouldn't be buying. If the sellers thought it was going to be vastly more expensive tomorrow, they wouldn't be selling.
The market price is the market price, and you should place your bets if you think you know better than the average punter.
