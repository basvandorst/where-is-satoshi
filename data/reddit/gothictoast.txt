No, he didn’t.

He’s being downvoted for 2 reasons. First, he’s creating a semantical argument based on the meaning of “official”. We all knew what the OP meant. He’s being nit-picky, which doesn’t get upvotes. And technically speaking, he’s wrong in his definition. Second, he’s created a straw man argument, as if OP was some Roger Ver apologist. You said “I think we can agree that douche is a plague to the actual bitcoin community,” and that is precisely the point. No one was suggesting he was a good guy. He was essentially arguing a point that no one was opposing.

That is how I understand it as well.

No. If gmail closed, people would simply sign up for another email service. No harm, no foul. Well, you could argue that you had sensative information stored in your email that you was not available anywhere else. Highly unlikely. When MtGox went down, people actually lost something they can never get back. Money. People can't just sign up at Coinbase and magically get their 500 BTC back.

lolwat. I deposit money into my landlord's bank account every month. I just walk right into Wells Fargo, fill out a deposit slip, and say to the teller, "I need to deposit this into my landlord's bank account." Bing. Bang. Boom. Rent Paid.

Can you explain the analysis behind your conclusion for the casual miner/bitcoin enthusiast?
If the coin is not lost, and is still accessible by the powers that be, why is it not being distributed back to their rightful owners?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:18:03
I'm not a tax professional, but I am pretty sure you can't claim losses on unrealized profit. If you told the IRS you lost $40k, they would say "show me."

These people are fucking scum
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:12:30
Got mine at 415!
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:06:46
May I ask, why did you keep 40k worth of BTC on an exchange instead of your personal wallet? What % of your entire stash was that?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:51:58
Once I hit the $1mil dollar holding mark, I would make sure I had the keys in about 20 different places. I just can't imagine what could have been going through his mind.
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:47:09
So you put $20 into a bank account... And then overdrafted it? I don't even think a $5 could do that. Sorry breh.

I have a question for you all who are much more crypto-savvy than I:
Can't we (the public) monitor all of the bitcoin wallets in existence? Wouldn't a wallet (cold storage?) with 750k btc be very visible to us, as the top storage in the world? Couldn't we have seen the money start dwindling? Who took the coins? And if they already sold them, they must be filthy god damn rich. There has got to be a way to trace this back. Don't make fun of me for my questions!
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:14:33
You have no real value.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:53:43
Can anyone in the world crack them? Might be worth a hefty price tag.
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:36:23
So, in short, the $137m of bitcoin was a completely made up number and the bitcoin that was in the cold wallets had been gone for many months prior to the death?

Huh? Gold also fluctuates in value. The only option there that guarantees a return is the bond.
@_date: 2018-10-01 04:08:49
Why didn’t you just pull out the bottle of coke instead of going through all that hassle?
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:25:32
Do you understand that the bulk of bitcoin’s hashrate and difficulty is decided mostly by large multi-million dollar warehouses, mainly in China, and not by average Joes like you and me? This guy’s operation contributes almost nothing to the ecosystem. If he’s doing it for the cause, then great. But if he’s doing it as an investment to make money, it’s not optimal.
@_date: 2019-02-10 08:13:05
Because he’s stubborn. It’s clearly the better option. Why spend money on hardware and electricity to mine, when you can spend all that money on the coin itself?
I went through this same situation, but back in 2014. The difficulty just kept increasing every month until the operation was no longer sustainable. Everyone has to learn their own lessons.

That is how lender's make money. They give you money and you make payments on the loan plus interest. They assume the risk that you will default on the loan for the opportunity to make gobs of money on interest.
On a smaller scale, this is why you receive credit card offers in the mail every week. These companies want you to spend their money, so that they can collect interest off you.

Would you say they are non-binary?

Is this a joke or a proverb? I don’t get it either way.

What if I was solo mining? Would I still receive a daily sum? Thank you and I do appreciate your input. If you would like to take a look, this is the machine I am talking about:
You are actually the first person who has told me that I would hardly make beer money with this machine, so I'm interested in your thoughts on the matter.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:16:13


Could you explain this to me a little more? Is it because of the difficulty level increasing every two weeks?
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:21:35
Interesting. I plugged in the specs to this calculator:
And it says I'd be profiting $66 a day. That's a big difference.
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:22:42
You're right, I don't fully understand how it all works (although I do think I understand the risks and rewards). That is why I am asking questions. I would think that a miner in the range of $100-$400 would yield me almost nothing. I have the financial flexibility to spend much more than that. But perhaps you are right. Maybe I'll just buy a low end miner just for kicks, buy some btc and just sit on it for a few years and see what happens. Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:32:45
This is the miner in question.
Do miners break down significantly over time? Is it because the owner overclocks them and runs them till they crash?
