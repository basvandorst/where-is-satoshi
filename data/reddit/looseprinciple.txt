Zooming out is still looking in the past - and the past has absolutely zero influence on the future, that is a simple fact despite what you choose to tell yourself.
I'm very happy, more than happy, to read reasons why Bitcoin will continue to grow but just saying "because it's grown in the past" isn't really very smart.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:12:06


That is crucial to the success of bitcoin, not only as a currency but as a store of value. Right now the only use is as a speculative asset.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:29:23
My TA is pointing to a cataclysm around $1232 in part due to the build up of a WDN (wet dogs nose) and what looks to be the early formation of a rabbits hat developing along the pixie line and diverging on the big axis.
Best of luck everyone, I will sit this one out and buy back in at 9200 on Wednesday morning.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:00:28
It's bye time
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:25:49
Pretty simple really - FOMO now it's gone back passed 10k and people assume it's going back towards 20k like it did several weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:48:25
lol is egg on his face
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:26:13
And are you gonna sell at 19k or HOLD and risk another drop?
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:46:08
Maybe those that sold at 17k are looking for a good opportunity to buy their coins back at half price
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:03:40
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:21:48
fuck off
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:51:32
Where are Paw Patrol when you need them?
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:19:49
yeah, about 10k by the looks of it :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:47:10
fork off
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:57:00
If it goes under 6k I'm buying.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:39:10
Might want to see if it can stay at 10k for more than 5 mins...
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:45:01
this from a redditor of 7 months? at it's best.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:19:23
just dropped $1k in about 12 hours - of course people will panic.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:07:17
There are some grown-ups on reddit who talk sense to be fair, I just don't want to listen to the HODL, Lambo and to the moon people.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:50:39


@_date: 2018-02-22 14:37:38
Haha no not in 1 day.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:33:44
I'm starting to think Bitcoin has lost it's original purpose and now is just an unregulated money making machine for whales and regular noobs blindly pumping money in thinking they can get rich like those lucky few who brought in when the price was low and HODLed.
I haven't heard of any significant reasons other than those 2 for the price of BTC to increase so quickly.
No big retailers have come on-board saying they would accept BTC as a form of payment, no governments have embraced it, and it's far too volatile to be used as a store of value by anyone with significant savings or with money they want to 'hide'.
Reddit, twitter and facebook feeds are now suddenly full of 3 week old accounts telling everyone to "buy now or miss out" my spam viagra emails have been replaced with "become a bitcoin millionaire" emails, and all my technophobe mates are looking at GDAX telling me they will have lambos in 12 months.
Have we lost our way? Someone put my mind at rest.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:42:13
I think most people in crypto now are looking for get rich quick - true early coiners got out in nov/dec and are living life to the full now.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:18:55
Nobody knows - lots of chatter about $4800 over the last few weeks, even while the bulls were running up to 12k.
Price is too high for me, it needs to come down and go up slowly.
FOMO drove the price up with people thinking it was going back to 12 and 20k - that hasn't happened, now everyone is having a panic about going down to 5k and pulling their money out.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:04:03
Just the kind of moon lambo dick that hurts bitcoin - do everyone a favour and fuck off
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:46:25
Moon party canceled - didn't you get the memo?
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:02:32
Now they are all buying back in again thinking the crash is over and they will get to 20k again and instant Money = Money X2
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:47:21
no, no you didn't. Move along now it's time for school.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:59:26
no worries - for $100 assuming that's not much to you it's a fun thing to do and watch. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:25:12
Why would you think it's going up again? BTC is volatile, it will go up and down, nobody knows how much.
With every major price point there will be many people looking to sell as it climbs - thousands if not millions invested by FOMO between 10k and 20k and will just wait to break even and run away.
You also have no idea what regulation will come and how that will affect BTC price - or any hacks that come out or news of manipulation.
So many things can drive the price down in an instant.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:21:09
People are sensible. Not many people invest in a falling stock that's losing money. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:35:30
Course you did pal - that's why you're on reddit calling everyone a retard.
Enjoy watching it dip 
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:56:18
Solid advice? Don't be stupid. The best thing to do in a dip is wait out the market and see where it's headed - the daily chart is terrible and bitcoin is in the middle of a downward trend.
r/bitcoin is full of people who "brought the dip" at 17k, 16k, 15k, 14k, 13k, 12k, and 10k all of whom are telling of their regret.
Don't fall for the pump accounts telling you to "buy the dip" so they can sell the peak.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:43:55
Go with your instinct. Maybe sell half and wait. At the very least if it keeps going down you'd be crazy to not sell at 8600 for a mini profit, that would signal a big downtrend even further.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:53:56
Coinbase is fine - get's a lot of shit here but nice interface, secure and easy as pigeon pie to use.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:54:13
Don't buy yet though, price is tanking
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:47:19
It's 13:46 GMT and the price is going down quicker than OP's mum.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:03:57
Tone Vays just said $1300 not out of the question....
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:34:38
man sell now and buy back in - even if it's at 9200 USD
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:57:49
changed your mind in 4 hours? haha
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:40:36
Are you a priest?
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:31:55
nah - sold at 10.5 - will assess if it get's down there. Impossible to go to zero, even shit coins can't go to zero.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:50:31
More than you make day trading BTC, sunshine
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:30:31
You are deluded - this number is based on what exactly? See what happened when we hit 20k or did you miss that?
People got exited by easy money, but they got burned, they don't want to get burned twice. 
Predicting 60k and Lambo's is worse than spreading FUD - you attract noobs who believe you and artificially inflate the bubble causing a pop and a negative bitcoin experience that will spread.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:15:02
Can you make one for those that brought in December
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:56:12
Didn't you "buy big" 2 days ago? Ouch.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:52:52
[To the moooooooon](
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:03:32
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:24:35
Yeah and what happened after the ATH
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:39:24
found the twat who brought at 19k hahahahahaha
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:20:22
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:45:34
OK so tell us your investment strategy for the next 24 hours and we'll check back tomorrow to see your 8k profits again...
Go on...we are all listening...
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:41:07
Come on, let's smash below 10,400 and drop all the way
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:46:39
The trend has been downwards since jan 6th 2018 - maybe that's why? Certainly more logic than thinking it's going up.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:55:08
You make it all sound so predictable, you must be a billionaire.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:56:11
OK, it's doing something now, price is plummeting, well done muthafucker with your evil curse
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:05:10
The same was said 
* at $15k - "Bitcoin Flash Sale!"
* at $14k - "Cheap Bitcoins for 24 hours!"
* at $13k - "Bitcoin Giveaway!"
* at $12k - "Buy the dip!"
* at $11k - "You won't get another oportunity"
* at $10k - "I'll eat my own cock if it goes under 10k! buy now!"
* at $9k - "This is the last time to buy under 10k before moon"
* at $8k - "This is the bottom! Buy Now!!"
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:58:42
2k in a week vs 8k in 24 hours - work it out. Price isn't moving enough to make 8k in a few hours with fees and taxes unless yoyu are risking seriously huge sums - in which case the risk for such small gains is never going to be worth it.
Also account shows signs of hacking - no posts for 4 year, no posts on r/bitcoin then suddenly many post about how easy it is to make money trading btc.
100% obvious bullshit
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:50:07
Ahh the smell of bullshit on a Monday...
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:31:27
just brought 20 BTC 
great thanks for the tip and insight
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:43:21
You don't need anyone to downplay bitcoin - it's free falling on its own. Every metric is on the way down including the price... this is what happens in a bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:06:29
OK Kid, let's keep pretending we're all going to the moon..
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:24:58
The past does not predict the future; that is the best lesson anyone will give you.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:02:46
$1100 &gt; $10393 in just 6 hours - ftr
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:33:41
Buddy - it's dumped from 20k to where we are now in just a few weeks - a 50% loss. It's tried to climb but continually fails. Stop kidding yourself! the market *wants* to go down, the trend *is down*, the signs *are bad*.
HODL and get rekd
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:42:55
Good call - I missed the FCP on the banana slope...such an idiot sometimes.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:02:05
Are there any prostitutes that accept bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:14:37
Finally found someone who get's it. 
Totally unworkable as a currency ***or*** as value storage right now. Who wants to take $100 for an item only to wake up the next day and see that $100 is now $40.
And remember no fucker here wants to actually use their coins as they are all wanting to "Hodl" to the "moon" and buy "Lambos".
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:44:32
They tried to me me go and HODL... I said no no no
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:50:17
^ PSA: Ignore the pump accounts, this is a natural correction and good for BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:42:09
Just like any asset or stock this is possible but almost impossible unless there was a catastrophic event - like a major blockchain bug or hack. 
You don't go from 20k zero without very good reason.
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:23:18
I'm open to it moving both ways - certainly not a mooner looking for lambo's (though it would be nice). Any reasoning for the prediction?
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:48:45
shitty idea. May as well do one calculating how much you would have had dec 17th 2017 and how much profit you could have made if you sold ATH and how many coins you could have amassed if you brought 2 weeks ago.
Bitcoin isn't supposed to be a get rich quick sheme
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:58:28
in a nutshell - the price goes up when more people buy than sell. 
But be warned some rich people will buy to raise prices in an attempt to get everyone excited about making money if they too buy, and will sell when the price goes up, causing it to crash back down again.
This is the downside of a completely unregulated market.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:18:18
Doesn't look that way Pal, seems to be holding well in the high 9s and low 10s; lots of people wanting to get in thinking 20k again.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:21:55
ah yes I forgot, what happened in 2013 guarantees all future outcomes.
