It is the end of the week

Bad grammar, so I disagree with your analysis.

Did anybody else get free BCH???

The walls are being broken!!!

How about you stfu 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:33
This happens every single time bitcoin takes a dip, everyone panics and starting saying this is the end of bitcoin. People be strong!!!! They’re scaring you so the price can dip and they can buy your coins for cheaper

No it’s not people who I made up idiot... yea I maybe redditor for a week, but I’ve been following this page for almost a year.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:53:19
A lot of buy orders it’s looking good
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:17
Read around reddit, people saying bitcoin goes to “0” and all of this FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:04:43
Eventually overtime they will.... these fucktards above me got their panties in a wad. It always has gone back up, and it will unless something major occurs of course. As of right now, it’s safe to say bitcoin is going the right direction 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:40
Hey ass hat. Looks like I was correct 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:17:41
Based on bitcoin history, it always has gone up... the potential is always there.

Redditor for a week, but I have been owning bitcoin longer than anyone in this sub...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:37
I’m converting it to BTC, because I agree I think it’s shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:38
It just fathoms me that people haven’t caught on to the bitcoin trend. Everytime it goes down, it always goes back up. People wake up!!! Bitcoin is in its early stages... stop selling because you’ll just eat into your long term profits.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:18:53
How??? Coinbase is not allowing it ?

I tried it this weekend when price was easily predictable, made .1btc like a boss
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:26
We’re gonna build a wall! A big buy wall and make the sellers pay for it......
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:16:43
I’m not talking ATH, but bitcoin has become so commercialized that’s its very hard to se it bottom out that low
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:15:18
Right? It’s almost become too predictable.
