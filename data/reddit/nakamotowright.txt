It was an inside job.

You won't even hear from them in a couple of weeks, much less 3 months. The principals are likely fleeing the scene as we speak.

Police aren't going to do squat about this. They'd be dealing with things beyond the normal scope of what they're used to. Regulatory authorities would be the better contact.

They'll receive BFXtokens, which will have a negative valuation.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:05:32
They should show which addresses the funds were held in before they were stolen. People should not take BFX's word for anything. Their team is made up of shadowy figures. 
It's gonna be a sad sad day when traders are still gonna go back on BFX, if it ever fully comes back online.

Fuck him. Can’t respect anyone who participates in that EOS bullshit.

Big names accepting BTC won’t really start a bull run. You expecting all those BTC holders and new folks to start acquiring BTC just to shop using it? The world is going down the toilet at the moment, economies everywhere are looking bad. I think some sort of major banking crisis or failure of one of the primary fiat currencies or a mix of that and government confiscation would trigger the next bull.

I don’t think miners control everything. With every bear bull cycle, new miners replace old ones and through that centralization cannot last. Look at Bitmain. I think their time is coming. 
And about high fees, I just transferred 20k worth of BTC today for something like 5c. How is that high?

Works for you but that sort of thinking won’t fly for an exchange or a hedge fund or some other regulated stakeholder. They need assurance on top of assurance (and insurance).

But he can’t differentiate ether from BTC. He’s successful but his opinion on crypto is but just a bandwagon hopper. 
@_date: 2019-12-21 04:53:12
Not entirely accurate: many coins never touch the market. The miners may keep as many as possible and only sell what’s needed to keep mining.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:00:46
BCH people want to take over that’s why. And they might be co-opted by powerful types that have much to lose if BTC (specifically, because pretty much all alts have no real purpose) gains traction in the long run. Meaning their end goal isn’t even to replace BTC with BCH (who the fuck is gonna use some lame sounding coin like “Satoshi’s Vision” or “ABC”?) but rather push out centralized solutions like XRP. The powers that be don’t want a decentralized, POW, hard to confiscate money with strong devs. This BCH war is more like war on BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:09:09
Why? The BTC price would still be suppressed 
@_date: 2019-01-01 07:53:33
A penny per satoshi makes more sense. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:27:49
I’d love that. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:05:43
If the price goes low enough a bunch of miners might just turn their machines off. Making the security worse. But might not mean much in practice. Or get miners to start mining one of the BCH.

Their ignorance is your gain. By the time they get it, you should have amassed a good hoard. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:20:19
Blockchain makes no sense internally to a company. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:40:07
They can read it but they don’t know for certain the identities of the senders and recipients 
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:56:40
But I’m real. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:40:21
Go fuck yourself dickhead
@_date: 2018-12-02 05:47:51
They probably cost average in, probably before 2017
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:29:16
Yep, exactly my thought

What do you expect? Its founder is a fraud and a silverspoon crybaby. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:27:20
Actually with rootstock almost being a thing now, we may see ICOs using Bitcoin as the underlying asset shortly. Civic will be the first. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:25:08
You know that the recent price run up is mostly all China money right? From folks that don't really investigate what they're buying into and just want fast gains. It doesn't mean ETH has any real merits (broke its founding promises too often).
