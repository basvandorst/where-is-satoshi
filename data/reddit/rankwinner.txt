Find me a company I can sell my information to to get that profit myself and you have a point. The information is profitable to *Google*, to me it's worthless. I always see this argument and always think it's idiotic.
As for 'highly profitable'... er... for millions of users, yes. For me, no. Even if there was a company that would buy my information they'd buy it for under $15/£10 since, as [this article]( describes, individuals really aren't worth much at all. You need thousands for the information to be even remotely profitable.
And it being 'creepy' is subjective and hardly a point. I find it more cool than I find it creepy that Google is able to use information from my texts, emails and location to figure out where I work, where I live and where some of my friends/relatives live as well.

I use it, it's quite good, yeah. I've never used localbitcoin but I do still occasionally go with bittylicious, depending on who's cheaper. Usually its coinbase though.

Since instantly calling Satoshi Dice scammers and posting about it online to try and start a shit storm **before** contacting them is obviously the best way to deal with things /s
