Yes, but a few million or even billion is nothing compared to the risk of the entire USD.

When they banned drugs, the price went up of the GOODs, but the market share of people using them goes down.
Bitcoins aren't goods, they're a currency. To deem the two as interchangeable doesn't make sense.
Drugs are expensive because there is a scarcity to them, but still a big demand.
If you can't use bitcoin to buy anything BUT drugs, then there is little demand or utility for bitcoin.

To say it 100% cannot be banned is naive. 
All that needs to happen is a gun used to in a "school shooting" or other tragedy to have been purchased by bitcoin and suddenly they have their motive to ban them. (or any number of other reasons and bogeymen a bank could use) Sure they'll still be used by fringe groups like silkroad v2.0 and enthusiasts willing to break the law for fun, but your mass market share is suddenly gone.
Again, Bitcoin will only really mature if it reaches a public mass appeal. The indicator I use will be when you can use it to pay your rent, your groceries and your gas. 
If it's banned from real world US related transactions, why would people use it?
Germany was really close to banning bitcoins in that other linked thread and if germany did so, it would have pushed the entire EU into banning it as well. And many countries who trade with the US must follow US trade laws or suffer their trade being shut down or tariff'd heavily.

Bitcoin is a [commodity](

Are you sure more than 50% of Americans pirate the majority of their consumed movie/tv media?

Thanks! Didn't know about the ham radio ideas.

Yes but both of those are digital goods in which piracy is not widely accepted by the population. (Still a minority of people are willing to break the law in order to watch their movies/TV shows)
What about the vast majority of a nation's transactions? 
Paying for food, rent, groceries?
