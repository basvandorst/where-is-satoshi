To make the transaction someone needs to be able to get my private key so they can attach the wallet to another device, wich is unlikely as I never typed out the private key and if I'm not mistaking is not possible to pull off by hacking through public wifi (please correct me if I'm wrong about this).
Does anyone have a clue what happened here? 
How did they make the transaction when I had my mobile with me all the time from a wallet that isnt an online account and doesnt use username/password?

I don't use google authentication. I think it was stolen from my phone, because Bitpay isnt an online wallet. The wallet is attached to a device, my andoid mobile phone (Galaxy S6). Bitpay advertises that even they don't have access to it.
I was connected to a public wifi "KPN FON" for a short while, wich is shared internet for every customer of KPN (internet provider). 
Is it possible for someone to gain access to my mobile, open the app, adjust settings so that I don't receive notifications of transactions made and make a transaction if I'm just connected to this public wifi? If yes, how is it done?
I can see the transaction on blockchain Transaction ID:
3aaa587a4185db37cfc353101cbbbce6bef2645408acd7a78167c9404eca291c. 
My full balance was send to 15Kn3niorUDCfFmY7xuiVdCFMacWPSummj.
Also I can see there was a new device (TfCRZqR3qMfazNJ7mNfKeFYLLA3Bp1iVDjm, it's not a MAC address, does anyone know what kind of number this is and what I can do with this information) connected to my bitpaycardaccount wich IS an online account.
Is there anything I can do with all this information?

They asked for more information:
BitPay Invoice URL (
Merchant Order ID,
Bitcoin Transaction ID,
Receiving Bitcoin Address
I only have the receiving bitcoin address and the transaction ID. Not sure if it's possible for me to get the other information somewhere?
