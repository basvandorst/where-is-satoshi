The way I think of it: when your child asks, "Mommy, how does money work?" the word Bitcoin will come to mind, but you won't know how to explain it.

One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with ToTheMoonGuy.
Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky.
In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand.
Sometimes there were two sets of footprints,
other times there were one set of footprints.
 
This bothered me because I noticed
that during the low periods of my life,
when I was suffering from
anguish, sorrow or defeat,
I could see only one set of footprints.
 
So I said to ToTheMoonGuy,
"You promised me ToTheMoonGuy,
that if I followed you,
you would walk with me always.
But I have noticed that during
the most trying periods of my life
there have only been one
set of footprints in the sand.
Why, when I needed you most,
you have not been there for me?"
 
ToTheMoonGuy replied,
"The times when you have
seen only one set of footprints,
is when I carried you."

This doesn't answer your question exactly, but NewEgg accepts Bitcoin and is consistently comparable to Amazon on its products.

Hey Erik, I think you're being misinterpreted in part because of this line in your OP:


If I really care to, I can read through the rest of your post twice and infer that you mean that anything less *that can be done by Core* is likely to settle the issue in any meaningful way. A less motivated reader will read this as laying full responsibility at the feet of Core.
But the bigger issue is that it compromises your claims of "just a suggestion". If you are asking us to believe that you have the only plan that's likely to "end the civil war", then you're asking us to believe that anyone who wants the "civil war" to end is compelled to follow it. *Hey guys, I think these ideas will help (PS it's the plan that has a chance of working).*
Which do you want us to believe? That's it's just a suggestion, or that any other plan is unlikely to help?
Edit: invalidates -&gt; compromises
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:41:09
Ha, written communication is a minefield. You can qualify it as an opinion or personal belief: that implies that it's not part of your claim, but it motivated you to make the claim. Or if you search your heart and find that you wanted to make more than a suggestion, then edit it the other way.

"Providing liquidity" is one way to think of it, but personally I'd open a channel to Andreas on the assumption that he'll be connected to another few channels, and I'll be able to route payments through him via our channel.
Now, that assumption requires a network size and "network effects" that we haven't reached yet, but that's the idea.
Edit: Regarding channel capacity, you're correct that he can only receive as much as he has available in channel capacity, but he can *invoice* for any amount; fulfilling that invoice might just require the creation of a new channel.
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:44:07
Yep, he definitely can.
The lightning clients of the future will likely pave over this problem: with enough people in the network, it will be rare for you to be the first one that wants to pay Andreas, or Company Foo, or whoever. In the rare case that it does happen, your client will let you know when it can't find a payment route and will ask you if you'd like to open a new channel to the recipient.
@_date: 2018-10-29 16:25:25
Andreas doesn't need to spend money to receive money. Instead, a person who wants to send money to Andreas could open a channel to him. Subsequent donations to Andreas could be routed through this channel, and Andreas could fund outgoing payments using this balance.

Someone posted this advice and it gave me peace of mind: decide your hodling strategy *now* and don't think about it again until it hits your conditions.
I decided I'm going to sell 7 coin at $X, 7 coin at $Y, and 7 at $Z. One coin per 7 I can write off to pay capital gains, one coin I'll bank to buy back in with in case of a crash. Till then I've got a small monthly buy for pocket money.
Now I can stop looking at the ticker five times a day wondering if I should buy or sell!
@_date: 2015-08-27 05:33:17
I take "most common" to mean mode. So all miners propose a floor, drop the top and bottom 20%, and take the mode.

I understand and appreciate the point! I've got similar thoughts...but I can't quite express them with a straight face, yet. :P
@_date: 2016-02-15 15:15:10
Thanks. (: I'll look into the alternatives!

The CEO of Coinbase doesn't know that Bitcoin has already hard forked. I'm switching to Circle.
When it comes to patronizing an exchange, I don't care if you are in favor of big blocks or small blocks, I don't care what governance model you favor, etc., etc; I trust you to your opinion. But if you demonstrate complete illiteracy in your field, I'm leaving.

I was able to follow the guide and install 0.17.0.1 by just modifying the version numbers in the instructions.

That's why I should have read the article.

A lender will lend at a negative real interest rate if their other option is to hold their money and lose even more.
Consider an inflation rate of 4% and a lending rate of 3%: holding and losing 4% due to inflation is worse than lending at 3% and losing a net 1% due to inflation.

Interesting! We've almost got the apocryphal "double spend wallet". I guess this is exploiting Blockchain.info's dual role as an actor in the bitcoin network and also as an information broker for end users; one role would compel a typical node not to broadcast the transaction, while the other role compels them to do the opposite.
I think we're going to be forced to accept replace-by-fee and a min-one-conf world. But as a band-aid, I wonder if we might amend BIP70 (payment request API) to include a miner's fee; if you don't include at least the recommended fee then the payment is not considered to be fulfilled. Or child-pays-for-parent would be another way to address it.

Addressing the assumptions in this question, from one perspective it is totally valid to say that RBF has been "added" to Bitcoin with the latest core update.
And yet there is another perspective from which RBF already existed in Bitcoin, and this update adds a channel for explicit communication about whether or not the sender intends for their transaction to be RBF eligible. The consensus rules say nothing about how to prioritize conflicting zero confirmation transactions; in this sense, first-seen, RBF, CPFP, first-seen-safe RBF, etc., all have existed since the creation of Bitcoin; miners have always been free to use any of those strategies.
If you're interested in use cases, that's fine. Just know that the question excludes the perspective under which this update *has not added RBF to Bitcoin*, but merely added support for RBF to a particular client of Bitcoin.

It's probably merchant pays, as with traditional card payments.
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:40:21
To clarify, I suspect it's the instant buy rate, and the fees are recovered from the merchant fees, but that's only an educated guess.
Edit: In other words, I'm guessing that fees are payed in lieu of cash back rewards.

The same rule that prohibits the defense from bringing new evidence also prohibits the prosecution from bringing new evidence. The idea is that both sides get to present exactly one case, ever.
If your case was handled poorly in a procedural sense, then you and the prosecution can present your case a second time.

One strategy would be to have the user provide a sequence of characters at startup. Hash it together with your /dev/urandom and the nonce. Then when you find a collision, present all three to the user. If your program is malicious but the private key can be recreated from those three elements, then the user is assured that their key has at least as much entropy as the sequence they provided.
Apologies if you're already doing this; I haven't taken a look. (:

Definitely. You might say that the law is concerned with internal consistency first and fairness second. I just meant to explain the internal consistency.

If you haven't seen Acinq's service Strike, it offers a similar experience, but it's more of a web service for programmers to develop on top of. They don't have anything conceirege like a tipping service, but they might have some of your other use cases covered.
They avoid holding onto a lot of customer funds but staying periodic, automatic withdrawals: when you sign up you provide a Bitcoin address and Strike will automatically send you your balance on occasion.
