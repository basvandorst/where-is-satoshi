Are you a misdirection shill?

Anyone can start a bitcoin exchange but getting users comes down to credibility. Coinbase has credibility because they have lots of users, working software and profits. Neo-bee had none of those.

Karpeles stole 650 thousand bitcoins. He has lots of misdirection shills working this site.

It won't rival the dollar. You can't use it in retail because of the 20 minute delay.

Yes, a fake company pump and dump scam. The standard cover story these days is incompetence, backed up with lots of shills.

He stole all the coins. It's that simple. Everything he and his shills say now is misdirection.

Mark stole all the coins. No hacks, no gag order, no incompetence, the truth is this was a very successful long con. All the other theories around here are from useful idiots or sock puppets.

Community hahahaha. It's 99% shills
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:56:16
The con man will use every question as a platform to preach his scam. If they let him speak, they are accomplices. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:33:27
There's always a few shill accounts defending the scam. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:51:32
The gag order story is nonsense. Mark stole all the coins. It was a long con all along.

If you changed your IP, why do you need a VPN?
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:51:37
How would he know the new IP?
