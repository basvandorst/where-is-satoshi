There’s no doubt I’m naive.  And yeah, it seems shady to do that, but at this point they’re being traded on most crypto exchanges and seem to not be crashing.  For the moment, it may be shady to name it that way but it doesn’t seem like a 100% scam.
Edit: but only time will tell.  I could most def be completely wrong

The technical limitations can’t be the only argument, bitcoin can exist and thrive without being a currency you use to buy gum at the store.  Do you see someone walking into the corner market with gold coins and asking for $1,000 in change? No.  So it has different uses and it’s value isn’t contingent on hat specific use.  Maybe that’s how bitcoin cash will thrive, maybe they’ll capture two different parts of the general public market?  Seriously, the argument is so limiting and detrimental to us all

I’m not saying you’re wrong.  I’m only saying talking shit about anything with the word bitcoin that’s semi legitimate hurts us all...

Agreed.  I’m terrible
Edit: and point taken

I’m referring to if it’s a long term valid crypto currency with no scam where everyone loses their asses due to some sort of illegality.  In your terms, you’re 100% correct, it’s shady.  but legally they’ve done nothing wrong.

This shit is exactly what I’m talking about

Thanks about the name.  I agree it seems a little like a scam when they call it the real bitcoin.  I wish they could just not throw jabs at bitcoin core and promote what’s great about bitcoin cash. I guess there are people everywhere who choose to fuck up others instead of standing resolute in their own good qualities.
Edit: I agree, there is no bitcoin core.  Only bitcoin.  I mis-wrote bitcoin core in the heat do the moment.

I haven’t bought their bullshit.  All I’m saying is their using the bitcoin name and thus far many legitimate crypto trading companies have allowed it to be traded.  I’m not some huge fan of bch, I don’t own any.  I only own btc.  I agree they’re not the same and that bch doesn’t have the legitimacy or strength of btc.  Again, I just think that it may be legitimate based on the industry adoption of trade, and since it has the bitcoin name in it, we all lose when people shit all over each other.  Now if it does turn out to only be a scam, I will be completely wrong and my arguments and questions will be completely wrong too.
