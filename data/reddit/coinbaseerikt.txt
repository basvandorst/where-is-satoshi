I'm afraid that is correct. Sorry everyone! Luckily, the re- verification needed is just your name, birthday, address, etc. You shouldn't need to redo the level 2 verification part.

Sorry, it's been a bad week. Our developers are working on fixing this!
I'm sorry that you no longer wish to use our services, but you should be able to withdraw all of your coins right now without issue. We look forward to having you back in the future.

We're having someone take a look at it, ~~but if you message me your transaction id (under advanced details) within the next few hours here, I can manually push it out~~. Sorry about that!
Should be fixed for now.
