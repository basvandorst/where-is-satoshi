Well that is quite obvious. But what changed the state of panic is my question. My eye was on the chart whole time as I watched it jump from 9.2k to 10.2 in 3 seconds

You jinxed it

For sure you have to put more in to make more. I’m sorry, but 40 dollars is really not a lot. I don’t even think you’ll see more than $60 dollar profit. Not for a long time buddy.

Doubt it. Though, other crypto currencies might be able to. Nothing this  volatile can replace fiat.

And you didn’t have mfa enabled on your gmail and binance?

What do you mean buy bitcoin under 50? Like buy a full bitcoin or buy a fraction of bitcoin under 50?
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:17:53
I mean, I don’t think these guys are trying to be assholes. Since you can buy btc, I assume you’re over the age of 18, which means you can do math. Just take the amount of btc you have and multiply by your desired price. 
You will make money, but it will not be astronomical.

And you are sure you did nmap -p- to scan all ports? Just nmap will not scan all ports. Next time, just leave port 22 as is and disable password logon and enable pub key authentication.

Lol, it’s all luck. All these tas are bullshit. Your favorite YouTube traders are full of shit
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:42:42
Don’t doubt it lol. I feel like when everyone is expecting 100k, it will not happen.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:20:34
Facts. Same goes for stocks, and everything else. The higher the demand, the higher the price.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:23:41
But why though, wtf
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:03:35
I feel like 9100 would really fuck us short term.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:08:42
I really hope not. That would really fuck us.
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:48:30
That fucker
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:50:22
Lmao, clearly no one is right. Last week every self proclaimed analyst said it would test 8k. Now all of sudden, their tones have changed.
This just proves that no one really knows anything. It’s just unpredictable
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:56:47
I wouldn’t say low. The volume is pretty low right now, and the price is declining. It rebounded a bit. I’m hoping it goes up fuck

@_date: 2019-08-03 14:17:58
Lol what’s the point of this. 
You expect to get a confirmation that everyone who has the opportunity to invest is a multi millionaire?
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:20:45
I think that the difference this time around is that more institutions are involved. Besides, there’s only 21 million btcs. Not everyone will be able to own one even if it was back at 3k.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:13:18
I’ll be honest, I see it more as a store of value lol. As far as it being the currency of the future, that’s stretching it considering it’s not regulated. Not to mention, it’s not scalable and finite. That’s what stable coins will be used for
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:06:28
Oh yeh and why is that? I’m bullish, but I’m just curious. Everything seems to be good for btc. Every time I wipe my ass, it’s good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:22:23
Nah, if you did wire transfer, which I’m assuming that’s what you did — there is no faster way. Coinbase is super strict. I was in your shoes.
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:24:01
Nothing? It’s only 150. It’s so little that even if I think you were to report it, no one would care
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:38:55
I pray for a pullback. This is so fucked. I deposited money into coinbase exactly a week ago, and it went from 9500 to this. I didn’t even get the chance to load more. Fuck you coinbase.
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:52:05
It might go back lower. Unless you sold low 11s. Taking a look at the charts, we still haven’t really seen a red day yet. It’s been going up for 9 consecutive days. I feel like we will see a pullback soon, similar to the one earlier but for a longer duration.

It’ll be difficult to decrypt it, but then again, the government definitely can decrypt the traffic if they really wanted to. Will they go out of their way without having reasonable doubt? Probably not. 
With that being said, if you want to avoid paying taxes you’ll have to avoid exchanges. I don’t see any othe way around it

Just use cash app. Everything else will take you days to get approved
