So, how would BTC work at a hot dog stand anyway?  Because, if I understand things right, it doesn't; not without a paper or plastic proxy.  Right?

Totally agree, but I have to wonder if credit card companies wouldn't move to kill BTC.  It would seem to replace a significant portion of the convenience credit transactions.  So many families use credit cards instead of cash just because of the convenience.

Could work, but it sounds like a deal breaker for common use if that's really a requirement.  Currency shouldn't require power or network.  I mean, seriously, battery life and wireless network availability and coverage being what they are, that's just the way it is.  Also, the fact that a device can just get dropped in a toilet and I would potentially be out a lot of money beyond just the cost of the device is also a deal breaker.  Yes, there are a lot of ways to lose and destroy traditional currency too, but we shouldn't make that situation worse.

I'm only an armchair cryptologist, but wouldn't it be possible to encode US currency with PKI hashes?  This would obviate much of the need for elaborate physical counter-measures and make currency verification automatic and fast.  The Treasury would then need to protect the private keys of course, but that's not really any harder than protecting their plates/press techniques and process.

I don't like that cash then requires an info processing capability then.  This is gonna cost your average hot dog vendor (for example) big time compared to just using what we have today.  OTOH that same vendor could just accept the paper tokens and not worry about it, on the belief (probably correct) that protecting against forgeries isn't worth it for them; whereas someone like a car dealership or a major retailer would find it well worth the investment.  Actually, that's not so different from what we have today now that I think about it.

No system is perfect:  
The same countermeasures in place for bitcoins could be enacted for paper currency.
I do like that a semi-hard to duplicate paper currency would be better protected from denial of service.  In order for a DOS to be relevant, it would need to be timed with a mass duplication event.
There's a lot I don't know about bitcoins, but I'm guessing prevalent currencies like the USD will take up some lessons learned and technologies from it rather than having us all convert to bitcoins; at least in the short term.

I wouldn't get used to having Mayer at Yahoo.  With things going the way they are lately, they are about to lose many many email users, and probably more.  Heads will likely roll, starting with hers.
Side rant:  Seriously, did they not include serious regression testing in their plans?!  I don't think they understand reliability right now.
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:37:54
Yes, but you're comparing BTC to credit cards and I agree it is far superior to credit cards.  However, I'm comparing it to current hard currency, at that is actually on topic to the OP's post.  So, on that count at least, BTC isn't equal to our currency in use today.

Yeah, incognito mode is an easy answer to problems with extensions too.  Sites not working because it's blocked six different ways because of AdBlock or Privacy Badger, but you still want a look at it?  There's your answer (as long as you didn't enable all your extensions for incognito mode anyway).
@_date: 2019-03-20 20:14:50
Yes, and?
@_date: 2019-03-20 05:35:09
This is simply using Bitcoin as protection.  How is that idiotic?  What if every besieged people on the planet used Bitcoin in a similar fashion?  Is that not an advancement for Bitcoin AND everyone else?
In other words, when all else fails, Bitcoin could be there for you.  What more did we hope for this currency?  It's got to be more than about "buy low, sell high", no?
@_date: 2019-03-23 03:01:30
Use Pocket or Incognito mode.

Would you show a source or two on this?  Seriously, the hype between this and BTC is confusing at best.  But one thing at a time I guess...

Ok, all the rest of that aside, how will we know it has proved itself?
@_date: 2019-03-21 01:44:11
Hmm... not sure what I was thinking on that phrase.  It's corrected.  Regardless, the main point of that post stands and I really don't see how the OP made Bitcoin sound like a pyramid scheme.

Actually, he very well could do something like proclaim the benefits of blockchain and announce that the US will simply convert its currency over to a fork of Bitcoin with a conversion to be completed before the next election.  
I don't know that would totally screw over Bitcoin, but it would be a huge boon overall.
Edit:  Downmods?  I'm curious.  How is this a bad idea?  I'm convinced it's a great idea.

In other news: Chuck E. Cheese will be doing an ICO to use a blockchain driven system for their new game tokens.  All currency issued will be dispensed in their restaurants when customers convert fiat to CECBTC.


@_date: 2019-06-24 18:11:53
It doesn't help you predict the timing, but it indicates that it will have significant ripple and even a small % of investors using BTC to protect value will cause a very noticeable bump in its value.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:31:05
Exactly.  Libra is the digital equivalent of Chuck E. Cheese tokens.  Good luck getting more out than you put in!
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:30:44
That will certainly be true for a little while.

See, you think this calls out just one person for their gambling behavior.  But basically, all of mainstream perceives bitcoin investors and users this way.  They have no reason to use bitcoin because they don't really need it.  They will likely never really need it, so why should they take the chance?  What tangible benefits are there to this?  Sure, a few people got rich on bitcoin back when, but so what? Now, it's just confusing to get into.  And maybe you'll have some sort of backlash during taxes, so why bother?  
@_date: 2019-04-11 04:50:10


Only state players could approach this with any degree of feasibility, and only with technology that hasn't seen the light of day.  This is my primary fear with PKI in general.  Everything built on it will disappear the moment private keys can be factored out.

So, then why launder money?  Why would the cash warehouse in Breaking Bad be necessary at all?
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:11:53
Except when the majority of the folks using Bitcoin only see it as a long term investment strategy, and they still cannot use it for most purposes.
