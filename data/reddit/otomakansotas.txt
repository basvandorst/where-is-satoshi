Bitcoin protocol (as it exists today) can be blocked/disrupted by ISPs .. block port # 8333 , or filter out bitcoin protocol messages like getaddr . Govt. controls the ISPs .   Why isn't network resilience built into Bitcoin network protocol i.e. use TOR or i2P ?

Why ‘stupid or useless’ ?  Bug free, Safety and security of Bitcoin core code ; It will be compatible to current bitcoin mining H/W ; offers the same value as original Bitcoin core ; environmentally friendly since it will have low energy envelope.  I say its pretty useful.

Not an Alt-Coin ; a 100% pure / un-adultrated Bitcoin clone ; big difference

Trading volume may be small ; but inventory is as big as BTC right ? There are over 16 M Sh*tCashs floating out there.

Could have said the same-thing about BTC in 2010.  51% FUD has been around forever.

Google wasn’t in the scene in 1999 ;  i believe they were just a little startup ; i remember someone asked me to try this “new” search engine called Google. But i get your point, most alt-coins will fail. BTC is here to stay !

Looking for an entry point.

i am more concerned about 51% attack on the blockchain due to such a concentration in a place (of allplaces) China. so much for one-cpu|one-vote  Satoshi!!!

That could be the case indeed.  However, looking at how money is pouring into worthless XRP &amp; XRB  (which in my view should have 0 value). It seems the end of this phase is near.

Most chartists/ Experts say it will drop to 8K .. dead cat bounce to 11K , fall to 6K .. build a base &amp; climb up from there.

ToR PTs (pluggable transports) can’t be censored unless ISPs shut down internet connections. PTs are ToR bridges and make ToR traffic seem like ordinary internet traffic.

What say you now ?
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:26:29
Told ya !
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:21:44
Looks like i am a fortune teller. Got back in at 6K as predicted .. bags packed for Citadel !

Are you sure ? I run a (ASIC) miner as a hobby, and it doesn’t use ToR ; i can see bitcoin traffic on wireshark .

If govt. were to shutdown Bitcoin, they’d just have to tell ISPs to filter the bitcoin p2p broadcast network. Running a full node would not help. If bitcoin wants to truly be resilient to govt. shutdown threat, it needs to use i2p and ToR as default networking option.
