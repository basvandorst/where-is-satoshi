The only difference between bitcoin and private point systems in many existing services is relative interoperability of currency. Now you can migrate your points / currency between different services and you're able to asses correct value of your points and you're somehow immune of typical inflation existing in many loyalty programs. 
This also has some negative consequences because these points can be now stolen contrary to service specific points. 
If you want to know killer apps here's the list:
- Cryptolocker: software teaching people security policies, how to make backups and a crash course on how to buy/use use bitcoin
- Prohibition on specific substances, gambling, capital flow
- Current monetary policy
- Shame

I'm sorry but you're wrong. Most banks were at least neutral to bitcoin companies until massive frauds started to happen. A growing number of stolen funds from bank accounts are going to bitcoin exchanges. This is extremely frustrating for bank representatives and exchange operators. The easy way out is always to shut down an account of a bitcoin exchange and problem solved. Exchanges are trying to circumvent fraudulent transactions introducing mentioned KYC. I don't even mention charge back / fake frauds exploitation by thousands of users. This problem is not so black &amp; white.

Price of Bitcoin is volatile only in terms of other currencies. How would you otherwise measure the adoption or wealth transfer to bitcoin if not in terms of how much the price changes relative to other currencies. National currencies are also volatile, the only difference they reached the area of equilibrium after many years of existence. Current Bitcoin volatility is perfectly normal and incentives people to invest and mine. 
For example if you would impose gold standard today, its price would soar up about hundred times because current gold supply is worth only 9 trillion dollars. That's why Bitcoin is soaring in value in times of bigger adoption. If total economy is around 100 trillion USD then 1 BTC should be worth around 5 mllion USD if adopted worldwide by everyone.

It is based on assumption that taxes are mandatory. In the free society taxes are voluntary. What I mean by taxes is your payments for services you require or would like to support. 
In the free society there is no need for a government and therefore taxes. In the free society it is your own decision to support poor, young, old and sick people.

Price deflation is only a symptom. It is neither good or bad in its essence. 
When prices are falling because production is more effective or technologically advanced, then this kind of deflation is a sign of well functioning economy. 
Sometimes deflation can be a sign of bad events, aging population, cheap import from countries subsidizing export, periods after high price inflation returning to normal etc. 
Monetary inflation, in theory, is also neither good or bad. The problem with monetary inflation is dis-allocation of newly created means of exchange. Most of new money goes to privileged ones by the state not entire society. The effect is always the same - huge income gap.

Those romantic views on capitalism (we looked at USA as a goal to reach) took us out the shit hole we're in. A belief in capitalism made us pass appropriate laws that freed the entrepreneurial spirit and incentivised  people to do anything at all. Previously entrepreneurship and financial incentive was seen as a flaw. We even had a saying. If you stand or if you slack, 100 zł is yours to take. 
I'm sick to my stomach right now that I see the same arguments from people that never experienced what they preach. I'm sick to my stomach that in the name of proven wrong ideas you try to promote a system that is a straight road to enslavement and dependency. 
And you're wrong saying that US swung too far on capitalism - actually it swung dangerously into the socialist state that burn your money on war, obama care, food stamps, etc.  - we all have seen that in our country and it's a disaster.

Still, on a free market, there is an option to choose with whom the exchange will be done. In socialist systems you have only one and only provider, which is the state, and then yes, it starts to become a survival. 
You live in comfortable USA and you never experienced what does it mean to live under a socialist government. In my life I saw a big transformation from a completely socialist state to more capitalistic free market environment in Poland. I wish you experienced that and saw what it is like to see empty shelves everyday in shops because of government fixed prices. Only when the free trade started in early 90s with new laws allowing people to start companies and trade freely on the market without any restrictions and big corporations entered the market everyone started to be able to buy more, officially, than only vinegar. In our socialist country everyone had a job, but everyone was poor and hungry and we lived like rats. 
So f*ck you people with romantic views on socialism. I see those views like people never learn from history and they go back and try to implement these sick socialist ideas again and again with the same results and they never learn.

The truth is, if Bitcoin cannot sustain a small attack whatever the type then it wasn't supposed  to change the world. 
This is a trial for the protocol and our community. This child of Satoshi is old enough to go alone into the wild and come back with a pray or die trying.

Not having one is not an argument. By deduction it would be an optimal state of things in a society. You don't need centrally imposed regulations to have a peaceful and prospering society. Free market creates self adjusting regulations. 
And you're right without existing regulations we wouldn't need Bitcoin because free market would provide sound competing currencies contrary to a state monopoly fiat money that can be inflated away because people are bound by law to use it. And now when we need money for the free Internet is not paypal that has a kill switch for your business but bitcoin. 
Regulations always end up crippling the economy. For example imports you mentioned are taxed which makes everything more expensive and therefore your export products as well. Regulations impose theft on what you earn making it more expensive for foreign companies to invest in your country and give your people higher salaries this way. Regulations cripple the economy by not allowing business to operate in many markets like police, healthcare, defense, oil trading, media etc. Regulations create monopolies tightly coupled with the state and create massive corruption and mal investments and therefore income inequality.

By the contrary not working is a start and by knowing that the more free market is the economy grows faster. I live in Poland, a country that experienced extremely rapid growth when we first got massive deregulation in the 90'. And then after a while things started to deteriorate once more and more regulations and taxes were imposed. Now most people are sick at the thought of starting a company in this jurisdiction. Most startups launch in relatively more friendly places with lower taxes like UK / Czech Republic / Luxembourg / Cyprus. The country obviously loses from this since taxes are not paid here.




For f..sake this stupid argument always comes back: "show me a free country". I already told you it's a spectrum. The more free country the more prosperous period. Just take a look at economic freedom index for more information.

Yes, because bitcoin is misunderstood by not only merchants but bitcoin payment processors. The issue is that merchants should receive bitcoin converted from fiat currency not the other way around.   
There's growing number of merchants heavily dependent on bitcoin payments and they're happy to allow their customers to convert fiat to bitcoin and stay in this realm. You should acknowledge that bitcoin is congruent with system D people wanting to escape from the war on cash or lack of payment providers for their type of business or location. And yes, the biggest leverage is on gambling sites, chemicals, anonymous services, xxx etc. 
With most of them we may not feel comfortable but inevitable course of events is they will drive bitcoin price to new levels and that will put more and more pressure on investment part of the economy since all other assets will be mediocre at best. 
Regular merchants will beg for bitcoin payments once credit cards become really cumbersome and expensive. But right now the case for bitcoin as marketing stunt is just becoming obsolete and merchants don't have yet enough incentives to use bitcoin.

In my view a Bitcoin wallet is a payment processor but to be more clear payment  processors develop plugins for most software products, payment processors integrate with PoS systems etc. so in fact  there's need for that. Of course this type of software shouldn't require 3rd party to hold BTC for them, that's obvious. What I meant is that bitcoin payment processors shape the market and merchant's understanding of bitcoin payments and they curb them to their way of accepting payments. And this way should be telling merchants, listen here's a system that will allow people to pay with fiat even if they don't get bitcoin at first and give you bitcoin this way

I think you missed the point. Private blockchains are a shortcut and nothing more than a distributed MySQL. They have nothing a strong POW protected, decentralized blockchain offers. Just like building a runway will not provide the whole economy (planes, goods, passengers and business overall), a private blockchain is only a mirage that cannot be trusted and will not bring more players to it. 
As it comes to budgets, it's obvious legacy systems require costly maintenance, it has nothing to do with innovation. Most of the time it is putting out fires. Banks spent about $188bn on IT last year and that figure is expected to grow at close to 5 per cent a year, taking it above $200bn by next year.
This is 40 times more than the total capitalization of Bitcoin. Where is this innovation in banking? Why until this day there is no payment protocol (BIP-70) for wire transfers? Why it is impossible to validate a bank account with a certificate. Why a wire transfer doesn't work on weekends or after hours? Why you have to wait several days for a wire transfer between countries? All this money spent on IT cannot solve simple problems. I agree most of these problems are due to regulations and red tape but this is exactly the problem - you need a completely decentralized system to get rid of these counter party risks and therefore regulations. Private blockchain doesn't solve the problem of regulation and cannot give any optimization. 
To illustrate the problem look at the case of cheap airlines. Big airlines couldn't just include cheap version their service because couldn't be fixed into how the whole company works and ended in disaster for the companies that tried to mimic cheap airlines.

According to EU Tribunal Bitcoin cannot be used to nothing else than financial transactions unlike gold which can be used as commodity actually. Bitcoin is a complete abstraction of money and thus cannot be a commodity.

On the other hand Bitcoin's volatility is mixed with an astonishing appreciation in price - at this point it surely counterweights volatility disadvantage for a unit of account.

It went from 0 to hundreds of dollars. What I mean people will still buy Bitcoin as an investment in faith of it going to 10000 USD and more, but of course payment processors etc. will want to minimize volatility/risk most of the time.

When you use Coinbase a transaction is strongly linked to an individual. If the recipient address is publicly known then there's no anonymity. Of course you can try mixers, altcoin exchanges etc. but it's additional and significant transaction cost and pain in the ass.

I gave everyone paper wallets yesterday and made a quick workshop about this technology and how to use it. Kids were amazed and grasped everything in a blink of an eye. They even installed Bitcoin wallets faster than I was able to tell them that they can go to Google Play and download apps. 
They even understood what does it mean to import BIP 38 encrypted private keys. 
In your eyes I was a dick but everyone in my family was super curious about what it is and how it works and they all understood that 1 BTC they have on their cold wallets will be worth more someday in the future.  It all took less than 20 minutes. My niece even registered herself on one of exchanges after my introduction because she wanted to load more on her wallet.

Well. Let me put it this way. What if I told you, **eating fat** doesn't make you fat. If you would just follow mainstream nutrition propaganda you would think I'm stupid or uneducated. And because you understand how human nutrition works, eating fat doesn't scare you at all, but most people are still afraid of eating animal fat because of official food pyramid structure.
Same goes for Bitcoin. If Nobel prize winners say deflationary currency is bad, most people will follow because they don't understand how economy works. Keynesian view of economics works like greedy algorithms in applied mathematics. In short, it's a *problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage*. This way of thinking is something that average IQ human understands. That's why it gained popularity. Unintended consequences seen by free market economists is something that only a small percentage of people can see - but even they cannot see that less intelligent people can't understand the concept of *unintended consequences*. 
Greedy way of thinking:
 
* Eating fat is what makes you fat
* Bitcoin is deflationary thus people will hoard
* Shortest path should consists of shortest vertices between nodes
Less greedy way of thinking:
* Fat storage metabolism is driven by hormone insulin which is direct response to elevated level of sugar. If sugar content is also rich in fructose it also blocks hormone leptin which signals satiety to the brain... Other factors can be involved - genetics, toxicity etc. There's still too much controversy to offer concrete recommendations. 
* Bitcoin deflationary nature promotes savings (bad bad "hoarding") in the short term, but in the long term can stimulate investments. Let the free market decide which type of currency is better
* Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm as applied to the multiobjective shortest path problem. is a good alternative in finding a subset of efficient solutions. It is particularly beneficial when intractability and memory issues become obstructions to finding efficient solutions to the MSPP-related problems.

It's simple. Over the years CPI calculation rules changed dramatically in 4 major areas. Just one quick example is discounting prices of new technologies. If for example new 42' TV costs the same as last year model, price included in CPI is discounted from the real price of that item. This rule even includes students books! Another example is to remove food items which increased in prices and swap them with cheaper alternatives in the CPI basket, for example salmon is swapped with hot dogs... Do your own google please.

- Bitcoin is backed by the Internet. No other currency can be transmitted without third party involved.
- The value of Bitcoin stems from its utility as a currency for the Internet. Water and food is more valuable than gold on desert island.
- Paper money can be diluted unlike Bitcoin that is scarce. What sends the economy into shit hole is lack of innovation, taxes, war, welfare state, state induced monopolies, corruption etc.

Another common case was that if that client tried to pay 3 times with his wallet, it didn't propagate, and all of a sudden after 20-30 minutes all his transactions appeared at once.
@_date: 2013-09-08 09:45:15
Most people used Bitcoin Wallet. Requiring a specific client is defeating the purpose of Bitcoin payments

So how to group transactions. Is it possible with Bitcoin-qt or other Wallet?
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:34:35
Bitcoin does not stop fractional reserve lending **directly**. It's just that deflationary currency discourages lending. Loans become marginal in that kind of economy. 
Banks first job was protecting gold assets and converting them into more liquid commodity like IOU's. Bitcoin is already liquid and can be protected well without need of a third party.

I don't tell anymore for other reasons. People start to be mad at me for not insisting back then, when it was cheap. Another reason is that they buy at the highest point ever and when the correction will come they will be mad at who again?
@_date: 2013-09-08 09:41:17
It requires a thick client (bluetooth, nfc). 
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:26:32
We had similar problem using blockchain.info API. We no longer use blockchain.info. At least half of transactions have terrible TX time. 
Another question? What type of Bitcoin wallet the merchant was using?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:26:24
Most people like me with libertarian views invested in Bitcoin in early stages. 
Why? Most libertarians follow also teachings of Austrian School of Economics and that means we don't agree with any amount of inflation and we believe that nobody should have the power to control money supply. As +bitcoinbillionare said yesterday citing Ron Paul: 


Bitcoin in its nature is a deflationary currency and that means it prevents misallocation of capital. It doesn't prevent boom and busts of the economy but makes them less painful in the long run because they don't change into the phase of recession which is typical to Keynesian way of dealing with economic crisis. As you can see today even 0% interest rates are unable to restart the economy and also you can see the downturn which is rising deficit into the stratosphere. 
Currency like Bitcoin would prevent governments to spend more than they take in taxes because they wouldn't be able to print money.
@_date: 2013-06-07 20:30:17
Because it doesn't have any intrinsic value and it's completely virtual pyramid scheme of dutch tulips and after all it can be hacked anytime and if power and internets will be shut down it will cease to exist and people using it are stupid nerds with no life.

Last Bitcoin Party in Warsaw Parking Bar had [almost 110 transactions]( Seems small but it's a start. 
By organizing Bitcoin Parties we have a nice incentive for club owners to start accepting BTC.
Bitcoin Party was also had a good PR and was promoted in local media for example

Just give them time. Talk about it. Seed the seed. That works for me all the time. People are always defensive in the beginning. Just get used to it and do your thing. When I talked to my old parents about Bitcoin they laughed. Now they are all over it and accept Bitcoin for their services.

* Build a website promoting bitcoin and explaining how to start with Bitcoin. 
* Register with  and build short urls for all your links on your site to monetize outgoing traffic. 
* Your website can also explain people how they can invest in mining by renting a miner  or that they can get free bitcoins on websites like  
Of course you can take advantage of affiliate programs available on mentioned websites. Find people interested in the subject and give them advise using your links in hope that 1% of them will convert

For most people being laugh at for having a controversial idea is demotivating. You then think less of yourself and actually not committing into making the idea happen. It requires a lot of courage and being crazy for not listening to "good advice" to continue. Most people are reasonable and will conform to the status quo.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:43:53
Hyperinflation is the worst case scenario. But as I said there is another problem. If the govt. under reports inflation by 5% percent or more it means that the cost of money is too low and interest rates should go up (but they don't). What does it mean. When you save money with interest you lose money because real inflation is bigger. Also your wage is sometimes adjusted with the rate of inflation. If your raise is based on govt. reported rate of inflation you lose purchasing power. 
@_date: 2013-09-26 15:37:52
It's easy to regulate Bitcoin (ecosystem not the protocol). If you accept Bitcoin in your business you have to pay Value Added Tax just like in Poland. It makes Bitcoin payments not worthy to add.

Apart from that people use various wallets on their smartphones using blockchain does not speed up transaction propagation too much. It's still about 15-30 seconds until I receive a callback.

Imagine you decided to pay with Bitcoin wallet
- you send payment
- nothing happens
- the line of people waiting is getting longer
- you're wondering what's going on (transaction still isn't in the blockchain)
- you try to send with another wallet (blockchain)
- it works
- all of a sudden after 20-30 minutes your transaction is broadcasted
- you paid twice!

I said eating animal fat doesn't make you fat directly. 
It makes you fat when it is combined with hundreds of grams of sugar found in SAD (standard american diet). Your body has to metabolise sugar (because it's toxic in high levels) in the first place thus fat is stored for later. Ability to use fat as fuel is blocked for a long period of time due elevated levels of insulin all the time. If you can't use fat as fuel you starve. Most people continue to get their energy from simple carbohydrates then and they make perfect circle. For more information go to
