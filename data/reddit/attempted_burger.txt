Yeah, they'll hear the news that investors on the largest exchange lost 90% of their value in less then 3 weeks and then the exchange became insolvent. I know that would make my elderly mother-in-law want to invest in bitcoin.

Employees were compensated in options, in their case bitcoins, which they were then allowed to sell on the exchange.

In all seriousness, they are pretty damn delicious.

I think anyone in the community with a single satoshi should consider donating. A symbolic gesture to Dorian S. Nakamoto, a man wrongfully and unwillingly forced into the global spotlight as the face behind bitcoin.

It's an improvement because the people on this sub will directly benefit financially if they can convince others to join the circle-jerk. Don't bother with logic on this sub, it's pointless.

Second major site to get robbed. When Sheep Marketplace went under some redditors were trying to trace the coins, I still see them being tumbled poorly. Any chance of a link to where these coins are?
