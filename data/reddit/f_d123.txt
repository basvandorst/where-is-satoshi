It's used as a payment system every day.
To buy fiat currency

It's offensive to retards

&lt; risky asset who's price has gone up in part due to loose monetary policy
Are you talking about Tether?
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:42:52


Crypto will do that

Sure, why don't you show me where I can read about a currency where 1000 wallets own 40% of the supply, and how economies were built on this system, and how it outlasted even the weakest fiat systems.
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:54:35
It only has a use as a store of value, if it succeeds long term it will be that, not as a currency replacement.

People like me, and Mark Karpeles helped concentrate the wealth.
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:19:37
It's almost like we had a fixed supply monetary system that failed miserably 80 or 90 years ago, and went through history's greatest period of prosperity since abandoning it.

Yes, do more research till I agree with you?
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:13:59
Currency isn't a store of value, it's a means of exchange.  It's a way that I can indirectly exchange my hour of work for a dozen beer, and it works better today than it worked 50 years ago.
If you want to protect your purchasing power you need to buy something with your currency that will retain or gain value.
Currency is designed to be spent, and the only value it has is relative to things with actual value.
Tl;dr Bitcoin will never replace currency.

You do realize that wars, while unpleasant, were often necessary?

A true hero, and great person.  We can only hope that the crypto community is filled with good hearted, intelligent people like Mr. Cotten.
I will put my phone down for 30 seconds when I take a dump today.
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:13:12
if its too late to buy, who will keep the price up?
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:08:09
Because it's literally a game of hot potato where you convince someone to buy your tokens for more than you paid, and now they're obligated to do the same.
While not a ponzi scheme per se, it looks and acts exactly like one.  Most decent people don't want to make bagholders of other people.

Is the BCH 45% drop real or is it a function of the split/adjusted prices.

@_date: 2018-03-26 20:38:17
What about the commission/transfer fees to convert to fiat?  Or the volatility in holding bitcoin?
What would be the reason for retailers to accept bitcoin other than to stop the harassment?

So you believe he bought at $2 and sold at ATH in December and that there are many more like him?
I call bullshit, unless there is some sort of posting history to back it up.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:52:07
Dislike his vid because he thinks it's going to go lower?
What if he's right?
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:32:15
Businesses, start ups etc need loans.  You can't just save up if you want to build an apartment building or a shopping mall.  No loans would grind the economy to a halt.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:49:35
I refuse to believe that you've held from $2 all through every bubble, all the way up to $19,700 and back to $3800.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:39:24
He said god damn you're short
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:56:18
LMAO of course you did
Bought at $2 - check
Sold at ATH last December - check
He walks among us folks
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:16:38
It would be incredibly STUPID to watch a $100 investment turn into nearly a million (on paper) and not sell.
Unless of course he's already fabulously wealthy from his career in modeling and race car driving.

Don't make heads explode.  Just hodl till moon
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:24:36
Why not?  Simply because it's very, very unlikely.

A store of value that will only have value for 80 years.  Like buying a house on leased land.
