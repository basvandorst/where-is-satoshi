We tried. When done as one offs they are a bit too pricey. But the immediate demand we saw could not support mass production (which could bring the price down significantly). 
I don't currently have any completed units left, so I'd have to start from scratch.

Urls in images and printed text are cancer.  Maybe at least shorten it?

This. Also, even though I consider myself somewhat informed about tech and cryptography, I cannot get rid of the feeling "I think I'm about to fuck something up and lose my money" when using crypto. A requirement to be a paranoid nerd in order to use crypto currency doesn't help adoption.

Yeah, that's the point! The angle reflects the delta in price over the length of the graph (default - about 100 minutes, configurable)

I see what you're saying, but I think you are missing the point. Govt regulations is not the same thing as implementation. Regulations say "PII needs to be encrypted in transit and at rest", but that doesn't prevent some doofus who wrote the login page from accidentally exposing my login. Government cannot mandate "there must be no bugs". That's the difference, OSS allows you to review the software implementation before you commit to using it, while current banking system is mostly a black box that offers insurance for after things actually fuck up.
To be clear, I'm not a proponent for either of these, both have pros and cons. I'm just trying to emphasize the difference another user was alluding to (as I understood it).

You're welcome! Glad to see it working!

So.. we need institutions who securely store your private keys. They could probably even lend those money (for a small percentage) to someone until you ask for your keys back.
Oh, wait...
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:29:31
I'm assuming they are saying we don't know what software banks are using, what exactly happens to the cash you deposit, how exactly your credit score is calculated, how banks secure your personal information and transactions, how they mitigate risks. Yes we know how banking system is expected to work from law and regulations standpoint, but technical details are obscured.

I'm pretty sure that regardless of who OP is, John and Becky were "I wish I bought in 2009" type. They were always jealous of the "free" gains OP had, and always wanted btc to crash, because"fuck him for making money out of thin air when we do not".

What are the precautions when generating a wallet? Without inspecting the actual code, how can one make sure the generator doesn't just produce some hard coded keys known to the author? Is it all just about trusting some generator that a lot of people trust?

The funny thing is, at current rates those $5 became $6 by the time they got confirmed. Exactly the issue Steam doesn't like.

as far as i see there are 5 possibilities:
1. the label is a joke
2. the toaster is unrecoverably broken
3. the heater element is encrypted with a strong password
4. the Bitcoins have been transfered to another toaster
5. you have a toaster
while my hopes for you are on 5, i'm guessing it's 3 or (possibly and) 4

Confusing names is another reason (their website states BCC as recommended ticker)
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:32:55
Oh, you don't even wanna know...
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:15:36
Yeah, this is what I was thinking. It's not hard to explain bitcoin, it's hard to explain money. People are used to fiat and take it for granted, while it's a complex subject itself (how and how much money are made, how are banknotes secured, how bank accounts work, how is security set up in banks, how do credit/debit cards work - what are those 16-digit numbers etc.) Many people don't know any of this and they don't care. However, when it comes to crypto every aspect gets questioned and explanation needs to go from the very beginning..
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:20:59
So is this happening because BCC has the same difficulty set as BTC while having much less hashpower? Will BCC difficulty get adjusted eventually?

Did she give out bitcoins to everyone at the end tho?
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:49:54
Damn, this is insane.. How is this even possible.  This piece really got me:
"a sense of guilt for allowing the government to basically blackmail us into handing over money which we knew we were legally entitled to". On what basis could they even ask for those money? "We know you have money we can take"? 
This needs to be made into a movie with real names of everyone involved on the prosecution side.

So I guess I'm still missing something after reading this.. The goal of the SegWit was to solve the scalability issues without hard forking. But after NYA hard fork became inevitable anyway. So why not just hard fork it in the first place? What is the rationale behind creating this whole side chain monstrosity? The solution is super clever, but is it still required if the hard fork is happening in 6 month anyway?
Also, why was 2mb chosen and not 4 or 8?
What is the estimated throughput of the system after SegWit2x is put in place? How does it compare with the alternative hard fork?
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:38:42
Lol, I like how it goes through stages of grief almost by the book :). Denial+anger, bargaining, depression+acceptance. Perfect!
It's quite easy actually, there are tons of tutorials.

Don't even need a raspi. Just esp8266 and a little servo. Total cost to manufacture (even with off the shelf parts) would be around $10.

ah, thanks.
do you have a link with some kind of write-up on currently known issues to be resolved for Bitcoin the way it evolves now?
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:59:34
Thanks! Yeah, I guess something like a short/longterm roadmap published by the core team could be useful.
