Ok, it seems something is really weird. I remembered my password (so don't really need the seed anymore), but if I let it show the seed, it is completely different from all the seeds I have written down (I have one place where I have all the ones I ever wrote down in my life - none of them contains those). Worse yet, the upgrade to the new wallet format broke things and I cannot sign a tx now.

Google for "Mining Farm". Almost all the results that pop up are from mines in China, because that's where all the big ones are. Heck, some of them are big enough to actually be their own pool…

Bad idea: The operator can push Java code that gets executed and has full control over the SIM card at any time - even when it's deactivated.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:40:27
Except when some miner makes sure to always fill up 20 MB to cut off the competition… So, thanks for bringing this up, because this is yet another reason why a higher block frequency is better: The impact a single miner can have stays the same. No rogue miner can do 20 MB blocks that way, they're still limited to 1 MB.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:39:16
A quick Google search would reveal that 40 - 60% of all mining **worldwide** happens in remote places in China, which have bad upload…
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:39:50
With 20 MB blocks, you would need an upload of 2 MB/s to push it quick enough. I don't even have that in one of the countries with the best internet connectivity… It's not so much about greed, but about mining not being possible anymore. Once that's happened, we **will** have centralization and Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:35:08
Can you please learn how to read? Miners need to upload their blocks. If that block takes 3 minutes to upload, the orphan rate will be really high. It's not about "not everybody needs to run a full node". You sound like you are just repeating block size debate counter arguments to arguments that are not even here, like you repeat them without even understanding them.

Except: If someone moves Satoshi's coins, the Bitcoin price will instantly fall to 0. So there is no gain in breaking those, you will only make minor amounts of money before anybody realizes that you are selling the Satoshi coins, at which point you might have made maybe 10k, so really not worth the effort you spent.

@_date: 2015-06-20 20:50:51
Well, yes, these are indeed things were a higher frequency would help even more. Though they are less time-critical than mining, it would make sense there, as that would mean you don't always lag behind 10 minutes + how long it takes to download a block (so, worst case, 20 minutes). Ideally, you'd have a constant stream.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:30:44
Uhm, can you *please* **actually** *read* it? It is a problem. Many remote places don't even have 100 KB/s of upstream! And remote places is where all the mining is happening. Most of the mining is happening in China, and their connection to the outside world is really bad.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:55:55
You want a block to be pushed within ~ 10 seconds to prevent it being orphaned. 20 MB / 2 MB/s = 10 seconds. Now please tell me where my numbers are off…

Don't worry, unless you have 2 MB/s (not Mbit) upload, you won't be able to mine with 20 MB blocks anyway ;).

Yes, this obviously would need to be changed as well. Basically all the block constant woulds need to be divided / multiplied by 10. Number of confirmations: * 10. Number of coins: / 10. Difficulty: / 10. It's just constants that can be changed… Which I actually mentioned, would you have bothered to read it…

About  It's possible to create a PoW that sucks on ASICs, but it would also suck on GPUs. The idea is to use a PoW algorithm that doesn't work well with low frequencies because it needs many cycles that can't be "unrolled" (e.g. state changes) and does many operations that are hard on a GPU/slow on an ASIC, like jumps. CPUs excel at that, though. So in order to create an ASIC that can compete with an i7, you'd need to create a chip that is as complex as an i7 and have several GHz clock, per chip. But then the problem would not be GHash, but botnets.

There is no reason not to use mBTC now and to use µBTC where it makes sense, just as you use cm, m and km. No need to introduce a new unit or "move" from one to another. That's the whole point of the SI system! And you know what the greatest thing about it is? It works for *all* kind of units, not only lengths or weights! It means you can say "1 kBTC" if you talk about something big in the future, but you can also say "1 µBTC" if you talk about something extremely small.

@_date: 2014-08-03 21:08:36
I think what it'll come down to is that Bitcoin is the "main" chain and many transactions, especially those that need a quick confirmation, will be done off-chain, especially the small ones. This *will* be necessary as soon as Bitcoin takes off, as otherwise, the blockchain would grow way too big way too fast. This is actually were altcoins suddenly start making sense. You could have regional altcoins, for which you trade your BTC, so you can go grocery shopping. That'll keep the Bitcoin chain clean and give you faster confirmations. And those alts could be replaced from time to time to keep the chain small.

That's why µBTC and mBTC is better than bits. Not understanding what mBTC an µBTC are is an Amercian thing, I guess, due to the lack of the metric system. The rest of the world is very familiar with these prefixes. If we want Bitcoin to succeed internationally, µBTC will be the much better version. If we only care for Amercia, then bits.

Actually, the baseband and the application processor are properly separated in smartphones. The baseband cannot directly access the application processor.

I disagree: ASICs usually run with very slow clock speeds. If you do things that require huge clock speeds to be fast, ASICs will have a hard time to not be outperformed by CPUs. ASICs are only good as long as the operation is predictable. If you add some unpredictability into it (e.g. the hash algorithm is chosen by the output of a previous hash and that chained together 1000 times), ASICs will have a hard time to be fast and affordable at the same time (they can be faster than CPUs at a much higher price or they can be slower than CPUs at the same price).

Lower frequencies travel farther than high frequencies. With ultra low frequencies, you can create a signal that can travel half the world, with ultra high frequencies it's a few meters.

This completely ignores the fact that ECDSA is quite new and it's not unlikely it will be broken in the future. This also completely ignores the fact that the hash to which you pay is only 160 bit. If you could generate a different public/private keypair whose public key's hash happens to match that of a key that owns a lot of money, you can spend it, because the hash is identical.

The nice part about it is that you only need to get comfortable with the syntax for messaging, everything after that is straightforward. And learning the syntax should be the easiest part of a language :). Once you wrap your head around it, it's extremely convenient to use and you'll even start to love the syntax. You write sentences that can be understod without documentation, meaning you can understand code much quicker than with another language. ObjC is actually one of the most easiest languages. If you can already write C, you can easily lean Objective-C in an hour or if you're a slow learner maybe to. It's just such a thin, yet very powerful, layer on C.

That's just non-sense. Swift is a language of an entirely different class than ObjC. Swift is highlevel with no way to go lowlevel.

Additionally, Apple officially announced that they intend to further maintain and enhance ObjC, even adding new features. So saying ObjC is obsoleted by Swift couldn't be further away from the truth.

If we get quantum computers, they will blow through ECDSA and getting the private key to the public key will be possible. If you don't share the public key, that can't happen, as RIPEMD160 is not easily breakable by quantum computers. There is a *reason* why you create a new address for the change instead of sending it back. And that's also the reason why you should only sign a message if absolutely necessary.
And no, SSL is not a different thing here. It allows exactly the methods described: The server stores a public key and you log in by signing a message with the private key. SSL offers exactly that for decades. The only difference is that it does not use Bitcoin, but uses public/private keys that are independent from Bitcoin.

Well, you have to differentiate here. Many ASIC companies just buy some mining chips and place them on a board and sell the whole thing. So there's the designing of the board to allow you to cluster many chips and there's the designing of the chip itself.
You can either create a chip to offer maximum efficiency - or you can use an FPGA design, change it a little and ask some Chinese company to  manufacture a few for as little as possible. The adjusting the FPGA design to an ASIC part can be done quite quickly, however, getting the chip for as low as possible means you have to wait a long time. So the design part is not really taking long.
Unfortunately, it seems all mining chips currently out there are just "quickly adapt an FPGA design to an ASIC and then just using the Chinese manufacturer offering the lowest price" instead of doing it properly and spending a little bit more to be efficient. After all, ASIC companies don't care much about efficiency, they care about making a quick buck. They don't WANT to offer something efficient to you, because why then would you buy their next generation? And if all the competition doesn't care either, there's no need to.
So yes, if someone wants to design an efficient chip, the design phase would take a little longer. If that someone is then willing to spend a little more for manufacturing the chip, it could be available pretty quickly. And if someone would do that, all existing miners would be worthless over night.

I told it you in €, as it's hard to tell energy costs in Bitcoin ;). Anyway, the +80€ a month are already after subtracting the power costs (for which I calculated 40€, as there are hosting providers which host it for 40€). So +80€ is what you actually get at the end of the month. It gets less with each difficulty increase, though, therefore you want ROI as early as possible.

Well, take for example BIP-38. You don't need to have any clue how it works, you just pass a paramter to the library with the password. In that case, "I understand it" is more than "I can implement it". And this is true for many questions.

It already exists and is called Namecoin. It has multiple name systems, domains being only one of them. The lesser known one you are interested in is called an ID in Namecoin.

1.0 and 1.0000 has *nothing* to do with rounding. The original value just didn't have more precision. There's no rounding involved if you remove useless zeros at the end.

Wow, a really early adaptor then according to the date you mentioned later - even before it was spotted in the wild! :)


This is the source of 99% of all malware. Don't pirate if you need a system that is clean. Ever. If that trial period is not enough, either change your date (works oftentimes) or install it in a VM. OS X guests work great in VMware Fusion, even though they are lacking 3D acceleration. Retina works too, if you force HiDPI mode.


Nope. In fact, if there's one, it's likely there's more. Especially as you admitted to pirating apps regularly ;).


Well, you could of course spend a lot of time analyzing it. Or you could just reinstall and re-setup everything in a fraction of the time needed for a full analysis :).

That comparison doesn't really make any sense. Does a pile of manure cost you energy? No. Does a pile of manure make you money? No.
As long as you have ROI, that means you get more money than it costs energy and that plus is big enough to pay for the ASIC, it doesn't matter. You can buy as many as you want.
For example, the S1 costs 230€. But it makes you more than 120€ a month. Subtract 40€ for energy, you have a plus of 80€ a month. Not enough for you? Then just buy another, and you have +160€ a month. ROI will still be 3 months. Still not enough? Buy 10. +800€ a month. Still ROI after 3 months.
Notice something? ROI is the only thing that counts. Especially with an increasing difficulty, you want to to quickly have ROI.

The two files you posted are identical and both seem to be a boost.
@_date: 2014-07-15 08:45:25
Short answer: Definitely no.
It's the same problem with any web wallet, even if you just use them to generate a private key. They can send you different code on each request, so you have no way of verifying what they are actually doing. If they aren't evil now, they could be later. They could store the key encrypted in a cookie, which would be a legit thing to do. Later then, when you decrypt it, they could inject code that sends them your private key.
If you want to create a cold storage wallet, you need to make sure that there's no physical connection to the internet and boot from a live CD, then generate a private key, and ideally, never connect that computer to the internet ever again. Just rebooting won't do: An infected operating system could just dump the entire RAM and still find your private key there after a reboot.

Premined, can't even spell Tor correctly, didn't seem to do much besides making Tor required instead of optional. They seem to think that using Tor is enough to stay anonymous. Well, it's not. This is no better than using Bitcoin via Tor, plus it's premined. So I'd say this is just another scam coin.
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:04:07
It will. ECDSA is quite new and much less proven than RSA, so it's not *that* unlikely that a flaw is discovered. By providing the public key, you need to break ECDSA *or* RMD160. If you don't provide, ECDSA can be broken, but you're still save as long as RMD160 isn't broken.
And quantum computers really aren't that big if anymore. It's a when, not an if.

Which will end up in being a CPU, exactly. You could even make it worse. For example, you could regularly change the hashing algorithm and provide bytecode for it. In order to handle that, the ASIC must become a full CPU.

Actually, certificate based login already exists in https. It's even supported by all browsers and pretty much works like described in the article. However, its use isn't widespread, since the Average Joe has a hard time grasping the public/private key idea.

Well, re-engineering the 2 blockchains will not work. The current logic in bitcoind will just let the longer chain win. If you patch bitcoind to special case it, there's the old problem again: How to get it from one continent to the other? Combined with the problem: What if not all users update before the connection gets back? Then you'd have even more competing blockchains! Also, re-engineering will not work, because how do you handle double spends?
Anyway, you say that if this happens in 2020 where the world economy depends on Bitcoin and not in 2014. That changes things completely. If the world economy depends on it, then Bitcoin is important enough for people to find other solutions than to depend on the internet. E.g. use satellite connection to synchronize the blockchains. Heck, if billions are involved, even someone traveling with a USB drive from continent to continent would be possible!

So, what should we do? Should I try anyway and see how long it works well? Or should we be realistic and realize now that it won't work well with 50 GB? ;)
If it doesn't work, I do have another idea for a project: Maybe you've heard about Namecoin. It's currently hard for most to use .bit domains. I could setup a public nameserver that resolves .bit, together with a homepage that describes how to use it on Windows / Linux / OS X / Android. Would that be a good project? ;)

ASICs can be easily made, too. You can prototype them on an FPGA. Using an FPGA means more energy consumption, though, but usually no speed decrease. Anyway, if you have it working on an FPGA, you can do a quick-n-dirty ASIC version of it with little effort. Unfortunately, that's what many ASIC companies seem to do, instead of doing a clean ASIC version which does not have the constraints of the FPGA version.

It's running behind Tor and only reachable as .onion for maximum privacy and used by me and a few friends.

The bigger problem would be if e.g. America and Europe have no connection anymore. Then we'd end up with 2 huge competing chains once the connection is restored, since in both countries, there are many miners. Obviously, the bigger one will win and only the transactions of the bigger one will be valid.
So what does it mean? It means smart people will look where there's more hashing power, and if they're in the continent with less hashing power, they'd better not do or trust any transactions until the connection is bad.
But luckily, the internet does not work this way :). If e.g. America &lt;-&gt; Europe is broken, but Europe &lt;-&gt; Asia isn't, connections can be done using Europe &lt;-&gt; Asia &lt;-&gt; America. There's more than one cable connecting a continent to other continents :).
Now for the much smaller problem of Australia not being connected to the internet anymore, I think it is pretty obvious: Anybody with an understanding of how Bitcoin works knows that every block mined in Australia during that time *will* be invalidated once the connection is back and that a transaction can only end in such a block that will be invalidated (because it can't be propagated to other miners, of course). Thus, everbody understanding Bitcoin will not do or rely on any transactions until the connection is back, because basically everything that will be done until the connection is back will be undone the instant the connection comes back.

Another alternative method for world-wide Bitcoin would be using a satellite. This means it's easy to have a downlink, but if needed, you could also send data back to the satellite - or use other means to broadcast a tx.
Anyway, broadcasting a tx is the smaller problem, as the amount of data is much smaller. For broadcasting the blockchain, there's also the problem of what to do if you miss a block, so old block need to be repeated periodically.

I was keeping my OS X install for years, too, but recently did a lot of reinstall due to HDs failing and switching machines. It's actually not that much work :). It sounds like a lot more than it is, but after you've done it, you'll see that you can easily get up to were you were before on a weekend :). So one weekend spent vs. a lot of dubious things going on on your machine… I'd always choose the former :).

I know you're obviously trolling, but here goes anyway: Bit is only almost as bad as Kilobit. While Bit could at least just be an abbreviation of Bitcoin, it gets kinda insane with Kilobit. But yeah, everybody would laugh if someone says "My internet connection has 500 kilobits", that's for sure! Because how could I have something that slow? (In case you didn't notice: Everybody uses bits for network speeds…)

At least Bitcoiners don't tip in the sub-cent range like some Dogecoiners do - that's just pure spam. So I think while some subs banned Dogecoin tips, they don't have a problem with someone tipping 50 ct in BTC (as opposed to 0.05 ct in Doge)

I'm not really sure why you think it won't work. If most pools agree that spam tx are a bad thing and don't mine them, that means only some small rogue pools can mine them. This is what we have now. If the majority of pools not only decides to not mine spam tx, but also not to base their own blocks on blocks that contain spam tx, then those small rogue pools would mine them into blocks that get orphaned. Problem solved. :)

For the "customer", the real benefit is not in spending Bitcoin, but as a store of value the government can not devaluate.

Well, transactions with such a low value are non-standard and usually shouldn't be included in a block. Maybe we should reject to mine new blocks that use a block as previous block that includes such non-standard tx in order to prevent such spam, as miners don't want their blocks orphaned.

With Python or JavaScript, you have to look up the documentation for a function that you don't know. For example, `copy(foo, bar)`. Is foo the destination or the source? In ObjC, this would be `[obj copy: foo to: bar]`. Well, usually longer selectors are used that are more descriptive. For example, `[obj copyItemAtPath: foo toPath: bar]`. It is clear which one is which, without wasting a single second looking at documentation. And it's actually an english sentence: "Copy item at path foo to path bar".

Ok, well, it seems to be not available as a native iOS app as well. I should have written in the title "Finally a *native* iOS wallet".

Yes, you can enable background upgrading of apps. However, I'm pretty sure that's opt-in and not opt-out.
I haven't disassembled it yet, as I have not stored a significant amount of coins there. But it does offer encryption of your wallet, independent from the keychain. It always asks you again for the password after a timeout. I don't think it is syncing it to iCloud, as that'd be pointless. After all, they want you to enter your passphrase and not store it.

Can you maybe post the last file from there online somewhere? Please zip it with a password though and use 'infected' as password or something (this is common practice). I might have a look at it in a disassembler to see what it actually does (i.e. if it also installs a keylogger, which wallets it tries to steal, etc.). It's possible that this is not from a Chrome extension and this is just using it as a place to hide. In any case, after uploading that file, erase your hard drive and restore from a backup you know is not infected.

In theory a nice idea, but in practice, this is very flawed. First, most modern printers *will* keep the last x printed pages in non-volatile memory. Secondly, most modern printers *are* connected to the internet, or at least can be. They run firmware with bad security (because nobody cares…), so getting into a printer isn't that hard. So far it's not that interesting, but as soon as there's money involved…

This is one of the rare examples where the baseband could access the application processor. Well, it couldn't even really access the application processor, a backdoor was running on the application processor that was processing commands sent to the baseband. Which means even here the separation between baseband and application processor worked, otherwise no backdoor on the application processor end would have been necessary. I would worry *much* more about the WLAN chip in your notebook, which is directly connected to the bus. If OTOH you just treat the baseband as a blackbox (which it actually is!) and don't trust it with anything, you don't really have a problem: Encrypt the data you pass to it and you're fine. Just make sure you're not stupid and connect the baseband to your bus. But I don't know of a single smartphone which did that - whereas almost all feature phones did. So this is actually an improvement.

It means what it states: If Handsoff is not installed, it installs itself as a fake Google Software Update (that's what was found on your system).
Even if it didn't steal any coins, consider that machine infected. Reformat and reinstall and don't chose to restore your configuration from the backup. Instead, manually copy all your pictures, movies, songs etc. from the backup. DO NOT copy any applications from your backup. And then be more careful with that clean install :). A good rule is to never trust an infected system at all, as you don't know what else is there. Even if CoinThief wouldn't do anything else - do you know what else could have been installed by whatever installed CoinThief?

It's better to restore than to later find out you have been spied on the whole time and all your online life has been compromised. Better safe than sorry.
As for your Bitcoins, *disconnect* your machine from the internet, start Electrum, create a transaction that sends all your Bitcoin to a new wallet on a different machine, sign that transaction and copy it over QR code to the new machine. Then reformat and reinstall Electrum. You can then either create a new wallet and send your funds back or import the wallet you created on another machine.
The disconnect part is important, btw. It's quite possible that the attacker already has your wallet, but not your password. In case you try to send your funds while you are online and enter the password, the attacker could instantly decrypt your wallet and send your funds to him. If you are disconnected while being keylogged, the password will not reach the attacker and you have enough time to send your funds to a new wallet.

Sorry, but you ignored all common security advice. Either use cold storage so that even if you get infected the coins can't be transferred (malware could still exchange the transactions you do before you send them to another machine to sign them, so be very careful) or at least use a secure operating system that you only use for Bitcoin. Better yet, do both.

The Bitcoin price is a gamble. You can be as confident as you want, you just experienced where it leads to: Nobody knew the price would go down so much. However, most here are realistic and are even prepared that Bitcoin could go to 0$ and be ok with it. And many expected it to go down. I myself expect it to go down much further, yet I still bought more BTC just yesterday. Why? Because I'm willing to take the bet it goes up again - someday in the far future. And if not? Well, I did not spent the money expecting to make profit. Whenever I spent money on BTC, I basically assume that money is gone. Because if it really is gone one day, well, I'm not shocked. But if I actually do make a profit some day, then it's just some nice extra money :). But I can't really make a loss, because I already consider it lost.
Anyway, if you think you're a trader and not a gambler, please, tell me if you even considered this: Did you consider the scenario that the crypto behind Bitcoin gets cracked and Bitcoin completely worthless? This is a realistic scenario. What if tomorrow we find out ECDSA is insecure? It's quite new and didn't really get that much cryptanalysis as it should have, so this is not unlikely. Sure, that would only affect addresses that already have spent Bitcoins - but those are a lot and would be enough to force the Bitcoin price to 0. So, do you notice something? Owning Bitcoin is a gamble - a gamble that the system won't break tomorrow. Satoshi himself said Bitcoin is an experiment. If you are a trader, you would invest in something less risky than Bitcoin. But you didn't - you dreamed of Bitcoin making a much higher profit than anything else, *because* it is high risk. But that's not trading anymore, that's gambling.
Please come clean with your family and tell them you have a gambling problem. You don't even need them to tell "I lost your money because of Bitcoin" - because that's not really it. It's not Bitcoin's fault you lost the money, but your gambling problem. The same would have happened with something different than Bitcoin.

You register id/The_Evil_Within and set the BTC address. A user can then look up the BTC address for id/The_Evil_Within and can send BTC to you. The standard wallet integration point is moot, as there's a lot of BTC features not integrated into the standard wallet and yet widely used.

IMHO the problem is quite easy to solve using multisig wallets: Have one key on your computer, one key backed up on a piece of paper and for the last one, have a device with a camera and touchscreen that can scan a tx using a QR code, sign it and show it as QR code again. I'm actually considering building that device using a Raspberry Pi, you could just plug that into the USB power port many laptops have and use it on the go.

I wonder how their instant transaction works. If they're in control, it's clear. However, they offer a way to get the coins from them in case the service stops to exist. Shouldn't it be possible to use their instant transaction and then get all your coins from them? Getting all your coins from them should have a higher prio than the small number you just spend, so should be earlier in a block, and thus result in a successful double spend.

Well, it is a real problem. When I started with Bitcoins, I got a few from faucets. However, when I wanted to transfer them to my new wallet, I simply couldn't, because the tx fees would have been higher than the value. Even with bigger amounts, the tx fee easily gets bigger than the value you send if received many small amounts before. So actually, you can even hurt somebody by sending a lot of small amounts.
So, maybe the restrictions should be even higher, so that small amounts can't even be send, and a service like e.g. microwallet should collect them until they are big enough to make sense in the blockchain? If they would add the possibility to send coins stored with them to another address, that would already work now.

mBTC makes the most sense, because with µBTC (or "Bits" - which really is the worst name one could ever use for µBTC) you still have huge numbers. You just moved the decimal, but didn't make the value shorter. With mBTC, you most of the time do - you're not interested in all those decimals at mBTC level. With µBTC, newcomers will think "Wow, this is worthless. I get nothing for 1 bit. Not even for 100 bits!". With mBTC, this is different. If BTC goes up again, 2 mBTC is roughly 1$. That's something that's easy to remember. And means that with just 2 digits after the decimal, you're accurate enough. So really, no, "Bits" is just a very bad idea. If you want to move to a new unit, use mBTC. And if you really want µBTC, for f---'s sake, just call it µBTC. Bits are something else, they are not currency. If I own 8 "Bits", do I own a "Byte" then? See how f---ed up that name is?

Well, I think for the case of Dogecoin, it's not really about spam, but about having many small tips that add up. In the Bitcoin community, there are very few tips, but they are usually around 1$. Dogecoiners tend to tip small amounts, but tip for almost everything that you'd usually just upvote. So the combined sum is the same for both, I guess.

Well, the problem is that as soon as there's a single 20 MB block, all old clients and miners would not accept any block based on that, even if it's just 1 MB, while the new clients and miners would. So yes, there would be a fork.

Enter the password and your keys can be accessed by anybody. Same reason why you don't do Bitcoin in an internet cafe! Same reason why there's no "portable" version of any wallet!


Yeah, because once you imported is, any malware can steal that key as well.


Not even necessary. The malware just needs to wait for a key to be found somewhere, create a tx and broadcast it.


Then how did you lose 6 BTC? Easy: Because it was also in a hot wallet. If it were in cold storage, it could not have been stolen. You don't seem to understand what a hot wallet means: *Every wallet whose private key came into contact with any device that's connected to the internet, no matter in which form (USB stick, QR code, whatever) is a hot wallet*!


I hope not using Linux was worth the 3600$ you lost. I think after this statement, almost everybody here will just think that you don't deserve any better.

You should not do it, because as soon as some miners start mining 20 MB blocks because some nodes accept it, we have a hard fork. There was a reason why Gavin wanted to wait until next year before 20 MB blocks get accepted.
So, if you want all existing Bitcoins to exist twice and thus the price decline, go ahead.

POWER8 is actually not blob-free, and TALOS tries to avoid mentioning it as much as possible. There's some binary required by the CPU for which IBM does not release sources. It's power is comparable to that of an FPGA bitcode. Which IMHO makes the entire TALOS project pointless. POWER9 fixes that, so they should just wait for that instead.

I actually double-spended quite a few times to experiment, but always only to my own addresses. I didn't dare stealing anyone's money. It worked quite reliably when broadcasting tx1 through a random node and tx2 directly to miners (most have some way to directly submit a tx to them).

It depends on how fast things work. For large sums, using Bitcoin is risky due to the quickly fluctuating price. It gets worse with different prices on different exchanges. So you might decide to charge 1000$. That might be 3.36 BTC on one exchange, but 3.38 on another. The exchange you use to sell your BTC might want 3.38 BTC for 1000$, while the exchange of the customer gives him 3.36 BTC for 1000$. So, assuming no time is wasted at all and the exchange rate doesn't change, there'd still be a loss of 0.02 BTC. And that's for only 1000$. And one of the two sides has to pay that 0.02 BTC. That's a loss of about 6$ for a 1000$ transfer. Imagine you transfer 1 million $… And now imagine the whole process of buy, transfer, sell takes a few hours in which the market price changes…

I haven't found one yet. In IRC, we once discussed warning in case the network settings can't be parsed instead of resetting them, showing the user a dialog asking how he wants to proceed. How about that?
I only noticed since I couldn't connect anymore. I always specify a server on the command line since it happened last time to prevent it from happening again (that server is my own and can't be reached without proxy - I don't want to leak my addresses to another server I don't control).

You really should know /dev/random - it's where you get entropy from the kernel. Even if you use "physical random" (I'm guessing you mean a TRNG or hardware random number generator), you should *NOT* rely on it. First, it might fail and return only 0s for example, or some other fault. And second, if it has a backdoor, you've lost. The way is to use rngd to add entropy from the hardware RNG to the kernel pool and then get randomness from the kernel - using /dev/random.

You're right, it actually only says to not rely on it for portable software, so maybe this is something that changed. In any case, I remember rand() being biased etc. So really not suitable for cryptography. Usually, the recommendation is "just read from /dev/random".

@_date: 2015-03-10 16:32:57
Doesn't solve the problem - they will feel like they overpay because their exchange has a different rate. You can also loose money, because if you don't sell it the second it arrives, the exchange rate will have changed. And you can't instantly sell if you don't already have the same amount in BTC and sent that to the exchange beforehand.

Yeah, I contacted the support and basically told them that reversing a transaction in Germany is only possible if it a.) never left the sender's bank, which also means the receiver never even saw it, b.) the sender's and the receiver's bank is the same and just does it or c.) the sender asks his bank to ask the receiver's bank to reverse it and the receiver's bank agrees. c.) is extremely rare and usually only for huge amounts. So I told them to talk to their bank, because the issue is clearly there, but nothing from them except repeating "we need to do this because of fraud".

Not in Germany. They require you to do all kinds of bullshit like a selfie with your ID. When asking them why, they tell you there's a high risk for them in Germany due to fraud because people reverse their payment.
