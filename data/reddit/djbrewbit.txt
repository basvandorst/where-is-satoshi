This is not a bad point. 
Although I disagree that you'll "always" remember your passphrase... it probably won't be an issue tomorrow, but long term it's a recipe for disaster.  
I'm not comfortable not writing down everything I need for a recovery
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:16:23
I agree with all of those points which essentially is the problem of "what if someone finds/steals my seed backup?"  [Cold Code]( fixes this.
So you get the benefits of a durable backup seed, it's not a problem if someone gains access to your seed backup, and it eliminate the need for BIP38 passphrase \(the OP says use passphrase but don't write it down, which I think is a recipe for disaster\)
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:17:37
Agreed, the importance of controlling your keys and  a solid seed backup can't be stressed enough!  
If you're going to spend the money on a hardware wallet I would recommend spending money on a cryptosteel for your seed backup.  
A step further than a cryptosteel (and a shameless plug for my company) would be a [cold code]( essentially an encrypted cryptosteel
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:27:31
I hear you there on the cryptosteel. I think it's something that forces newbs to make a backup which is useful.
My only critique of your advise is telling people not to write their password down. I'm just picturing in 10 years trying to remember a password, not going to happen, for me anyway. Also If the person passed away the keys are essentially gone.
It seems like you have your system down though. I would look into [Cold Code]( it eliminates the need for a BIP38 passpharse, which IMO is going to cause a ton of heartache from lost keys as time goes on.

Is using GDP a little misleading?
Federal govt revenue is only like $3T/yr. Using your analogy it's more like you make $100k/yr and have $700k in debt (oh, and it's adjustable rate)
Of course the US holds several 10s of trillions in assets and the printing press so maybe it's nbd

Crazy, is that near the food court at bellis-fair?

I think they get their cut on the exchange rate. Just 
went to this mall and bought $20 worth at about $7,100/btc while it's trading at ~6,500 on Gemini

Thanks for that input and you're absolutely correct. This boils down to subtracting 12 sets of 2 numbers. It sounds easy but actually introduces a lot of chances to mistype or misread a number.
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:49:16
This should be Interesting. I would trust companies competing to be the gold standard of best practices over a government regulator agency anyday

Yes, every cold code kit comes with a unique, random wordlist. You create your own cold Code, so only you handle your wallet wordlist and thus private keys: [How to create your Cold Code](  
I put a lot of effort into the video, but I'm sure it's hard to watch... Hopefully the content comes through. Will improve in the future
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:23:01
Yes, you store the plate physically and the code digitally.  
The idea is you can securely destroy your wallet wordlist, because you can recover it by combining the plate and the code. So you don't have a single point storing your wordlist. Here's the complete [How-To](  
I'm not familiar with protectedtext.com, but if it's password protected and you feel it is secure, then I would say use it  
I'm happy to see you're going to post a review! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions to improve the system.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:23:59
I agree with most the comments here: 
 
1. Get a Trezor/Ledger  
2. Backup the mnemonic with a cryptosteel or something more secure like [this](
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:26:49
nobody is laughing at you, if you think it's such a shitty system then you should use a different one

Dang, I'm going to have to remember this next time I'm trying to explain bitcoin/blockchain to someone.  
Surprisingly good mix of entertainment and information, should help me be less of a "Dan"

I will add youtube links to the videos.   So the product is basically a cipher for your wallet word-list. You store a random wordlist and a code that converts it into your wallet wordlist.  I've got a few comments on how hard it is to figure out, I'm currently working on clarifying this! Let me know if you have any specific suggestions. 
 Here are the videos: Cold Code - What is it?

Thanks for the constructive feedback, really improving the community with comments like that

I like it. I'm happy to see you thinking ahead
@_date: 2018-03-06 05:43:28
Got it, garden fertilizer, again not very constructive.  
If you have specific issues I'd be happy to debate their merits with you!

For security, we keep no record of what random wordlist we have made, let alone which were sent where.  
The random wordlist is on the plates in BIP39 number format. We send you two matching plates so if you lose one you can still backup your wallet wordlist, unlike say cryptosteel or bitkee.   
So you store the plates physically and the conversion list digitally.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:01:19
Good catch, I've changed the wording of my post
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:17:31
Hey guys. Let me know what you think of the website I've created devoted to a method of storing your crypto wallet backup word-list I call "Cold Code."
You can use this method on your own, or purchase the kit provided on the site. (Use code REDDIT10 to get $10 off your kit this weekend)
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:02:50
We do send you the plates with a unique, random wordlist; however, you create the conversion list yourself [How to create your Cold Code](  
This means only you handle your wallet wordlist and thus private keys! There is almost no trust required in Cold Code as a company this way, one of the main benefits of the method
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:17:00
I think you got it:  
1. We give you the indestructible plate with random numbers
2. You created the code (or formula) that turns the random numbers into your private keys (wallet wordlist)  
You can store the code however you like, we recommend digitally.

If you've put yourself in a situation where a block not being mined in ten minutes is costing you money, when it's not typical but completely normal for a block to not be mined in an hour.... know the system you're using is what I'm saying
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:58:34
Wordlist security is a huge part of storing your cryptocurrencies, we should make as many options available for people to choose from.  
Send me a link for the methods that offers the same benefits. Keep in mind you don't need the Cold Code Company to use the cold code method
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:58:11
These are great points. Keep in mind that your only store your "cold code" online, which has 0 relation to your wallet wordlist without the random wordlist.  
Each cold code number has 2048 possible combinations, the same as any BIP39 wordlist entry. Thus, to someone accessing to your cold code online, they are no closer to guessing your wallet wordlist then having any random wordlist.  
If heirs find the random wordlist plate with "coldcodecrytpo.com" on it, they could deduce how to recover the wordlist.

HODL on... HODL on.. The price just doesn't matter, you'll see!  
This is my new favorite!
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:16:50
Yes the manual calculation must be done carefully, so long as you verify your work the risk is minimized. I know a number of people using this method and so far no problems creating/recovering wallet wordlists.  
Really just the how-to video must remain find-able.  
Give it a shot! You might be surprised at how much better you feel not having a single point of failure. Use REDDIT10 at checkout and get $10 off, for a grand total of $15

The "online Equivalent of Gold"? Only your know, more secure, more divisible, more fungible, more.... better
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:35:15
I think first you should know that keys come in pairs, a public key and a corresponding private key.  
You will only ever find public keys on the bitcoin ledger (aka blockchain). The private key allows you to "unlock" the public key on the ledger so you can spend your bitcoin. Only you know your private keys, via your wallet.  
If you lost your wallet, you've lost the private keys to your bitcoin and thus your ability to spend them! Disaster!... but wait, if you made a backup of that wallet then you can recover those private keys
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:44:03
I agree with this. Here's how I decentralize my wordlist and maintain multiple recovery methods: [Cold Code](

Cool Product!
The only downside I see is I'd have to put my mnemonic on a computer to make my part of the key. I use hardware wallets exactly to avoid this, do you see a way around it?
I have a company called [Cold Code]( that makes similar two part mnemonic phrase recovery. The main complaint I'm seeing in these comments is having to store two physical parts, thus increasing the chance of misplacing them.
If the half they make is encrypted enough, you could suggest \(as I do with Cold Code\) people store it digitally in their dropbox/Google Drive/computer drive etc... This makes half the key 100&amp; durable and pretty much impossible to loose!
Again I think this is a pretty sweet solution
