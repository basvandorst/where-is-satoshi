That's my question though is when it will be stable because everyone is preaching it as the replacement for the banks but it can't even hold reliable worth. Unless some sort of market controlling mechanism can be built into it to somehow guarantee their money isn't going to depreciate over night, no one would be able to take it seriously as a replacement.
This isn't a question regarding investment or cluelessness in general it's just trying to see some different viewpoints on how people might see this actually making its way into our future as people are claiming.

Is everyone always so condescending on Reddit or just this sub? Seriously no one can just have a normal conversation? And yes i just started reading this forum but am not new to Bitcoin. Stable is my reference to my first coin I bought in 2012 at $13 and subsequent exchanges beyond that which only ever went up with leftovers in my wallet. It's only since this past year it has become unreliably all over the place.

I think this is the key point I just started realizing as an answer to my question. The market needs to become a crap load bigger to absorb lower averages triggered by RICH investors adding and removing large sums of money. Investor capital is too shocking to the system right now.
I don't think Bitcoin was ever intended to be bought and sold as a means of profit?

Doing something wrong? It's a general concept of currency. For instance, you go on vacation somewhere and u have USD so you exchange currency at an equal value and can have some level of confidence your money will remain equal while you stay there and spend it. There is stability there you would never think twice your money would be worth less or buy less a day after you exchanged it.
I don't know what you mean doing something wrong. There is no right or wrong with crypto unless u have a time machine and can read the future.
