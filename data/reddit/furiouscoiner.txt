Last time I'll say this.  There is a raging misplaced level of self importance throughout this subreddit.  Neither people nor organizations are paying anyone to disagree with reddits bitcoiners.  The collective opinions here do not register outside r/bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-11-20 18:04:28
It means price is driven by supply and demand on exchanges, which is a small fraction of the total bitcoins in circulation.  Until you have an idea how many coins are mined and directly moved to an exchange for sale, you have no idea how price will be affected. News of the impending halving as it approaches will have little effect on price, as most news does not impact price.

 there is no way to spin the truth that spending bitcoin will cost you more than any other option.  It's accepted In fewer places, will cost you a fee or markup to immediately replace it if you decide to and the exchange rates used by many retailers are pegged to the lower priced exchanges (Gyft for example).  Make the case for speeding up adoption, but financially its more expensive.

No, r/bitcoin stop trying to spin every bad piece of news into some fantasy about how bitcoin benefits.  It doesn't and it won't.  China has said they are going to put tight fiscal controls on bitcoin and pushing it into black markets and newly announced tip gimmicks isn't good.  Bitcoin legitimacy has been taken out at the knees and it won't help that some twitter users can tip each other for handjobs or whatever else you are thinking here.  Look at the price, that will tell you if this is good for bitcoin.

Don't get me started on these capital vulturist jobbers ass raping the populace with promise of bitcoin while delivering NOTHING!  I tried long and hard to get validated, NOTHING!  Finally when my time comes, can't buy a dinkuscoin, satoshi or NOTHING! cause they ran out!  Are you fucking kidding me!  I tried to sign up at $230 coin, can finally buy and it's $600.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:52:01
Im thinking of selling to.  Was it hard?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:56:07
$400?  Pretty soon that will be one bitcoin

When someone uses the term 'Malarkey', whether its about about bitcoin or not, 99.9% of the time they are not going to like bitcoin

Bitcoin needs more gifs and advice animals, please.  Attracts more of the unwashed
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:24:39

Quark is faggot money

Growing the bitcoin economy is more than just pumping prices up so you can sell high to the next guy buying in.  If thats what you are about, go visit r/litecoin.
Bitcoin's value will match its price only by exercising the utility for BTC.  That means you have to use it, not just sit on it and follow the ticker.  The deal referenced above gives you a financial incentive to use BTC.  Many services do not, see Snapcard for example.
I can buy replacement BTC immediately from Coinbase right on my phone, its not hard.

I boought airline tix from cheap air, super easy. Not all the personal info to fill out.  First and last name, qr scan, done
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:44:14
I notice you dont really pipe up unless bitcoin prices fall.  Its really a very tired act.  At least go back to propping up Quark, at least thats worth a few laughs.

Calls it 'The bitcoin'
Sounds legit
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:10:10
Be careful or you will get fisted sideways by high tech shysters that exploit nubiles such as you and me.
