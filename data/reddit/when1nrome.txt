Ok what assets does bitfinex own to back up my transaction? Gold? Silver? Titanium? What do they own that backs up my transaction?

No one ever answered me, what can you really spend bitcoin on? And in what countries? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:22:52
You know whats even more rational? Spending time and money to get bitcoins, that have no real value and are not backed by anything. I can spend my time and money on making a backed currency and pay bills instead, now thats rational. Case in point if you have 50billion bit coin dollaroos and i have 5 euro or 5 dollars in reality im still richer than you. Because i can go buy something anywhere ,in the world.

So can i ask a dumb question,  lets say you have 200k in bit coins. How do you cash it out? Im 99% sure my bank and the fbi and the cia would have a bunch of questions if i suddenly had 1 billion dollars? And if you cant cash it out. What's the point? Buy 1 billion dollars worth of pizza?

@_date: 2017-10-13 11:06:13
I just realized that people who use bitcoin are hipsters
