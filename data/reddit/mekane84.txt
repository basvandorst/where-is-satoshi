how has this not dropped the price more, I need to buy in cheaper.  sell you idiots :)

Coinbase is the easiest and most popular,   you can buy bitcoin there immediately using the "buy/sell" tab, but they charge you a fee.
With a couple more steps, you can drastically reduce or even completely bypass the fee.  To do that, setup a USD wallet under "accounts" tab, then deposit there.  you can then buy bitcoin on Gdax (after your deposit goes through, which could take 5-6 days or something):  which is connected to your coinbase account - its the same company, for a much much lower fee (or free with limit order).  I don't think it's all that hard to figure out, and its kind of fun learning how to buy directly on the exchange.
The downside of the 2nd option is you have to wait for deposit to go through, and bitcoin price could have gone up in that time.  if you are buying 15-20 BTC weekly, you will save thousands of dollars by avoiding the fees.
You will also need to apply for higher weekly deposit limits.  I haven't done that myself so I don't know how long that usually takes but their website says 4-5 business days
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:03:00
I would think it's the other way around, people are holding Tether instead of BTC.  If Tether is to go away, they will buy crypto with Tether
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:39:09
If you believe the theory that whales were shorting and pumped and dumped... Do you think they will do this again?  That would mean they would pump the market again.
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:58:51
I am fine with this.  Coffee shop using a 3rd party to hold 0.2 btc or whatever is not a big deal.  Right now this is a lot easier than hosting your own LN node.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:50:44
thank you
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:31:58
I want to open a lightning channel on the mainnet, so I could theoretically pay them, is there a program to help me do this?
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:18:55
No that makes you a good trader.  I think a lot of people are aware there will be dips, and there is likely market manipulation going on, so selling low is the worst thing you can do.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:19:28
does this take into account transaction times and fees?  i think that would be a better chart to match up with this.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:33:28
it seems like consensus would be difficult to get though?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:36:33
i appreciate the information myself
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:15:16
I would think they would want to make even more money.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:23:23
Thank you.  That is awesome, so cheap.  I guess opening a LN channel won't be so bad.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:50:14

any crypto can be a store of value.  bitcoin is the most secure and biggest name.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:41:37
its a combination of a bunch of things, INCLUDING transaction fees and time.  it's just ridiculous to think we will continue on the same trends as the past when things are very different today because of the fees and time.
Bitcoin cash doesn't have the name that Bitcoin does and it has problems of it's own that the bigger block size brings.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:46:31
its pretty simple actually.  it's the total quantity of all the limit orders at each price level.  so if jack is selling 1 btc at $14000 and jill is selling 2 btc at 14500, then the depth chart would be 3 btc at 14500 since you add jacks and jills together.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:51:28
they don't even batch transactions!?
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:58:54
green dildos all the way up to 20k!
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:48:04
I read that bitcoin can only do 7 transaction per second.  How many more will it be able to do with Segwit and Schnorr and other ideas?  Do you think once we have Lightning Network working, that 7 tx/s will be enough? Or will we some day need to increase block size?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:30:47
Does GDAX order book show only limit orders, or market orders, too?  If so, what price does it show for the market order?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:20:35
I am a bitcoin believer myself, you don't have to convince me.  I just don't expect past trends to continue as they have.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:10:08
No, but it could slump until we get more news.  Could be as soon as tomorrow, we don't know when it will come.  So and so accepting Bitcion, something like that or Lightning Network wallet ready.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:09:22
I read that wrong at first, and was thinking you had type that if you worked overtime at your job instead of reading about bitcoin all day, if you would actually have made more money, i think about this sometimes.  bitcoin is certainly way more interesting though.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:29:08
you guys checked mempool lately? we are at like 1/2 of what it was a couple days ago, amazing how fast its clearing up
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:14:23
so how many satoshi per transaction? how large is each transaction I guess is what i'm saying, or is it complicated?
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:50:52
if you want to buy something with bitcoin at a store like this, do you have to wait around for the transaction to go through, or do they just trust that you paid them if you show them or something?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:32:40
very large investor
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:16:29
I think we both understand risk/reward, we just have a different assessment of Bitcoin/crypto future market.  I don't think it's nearly as risky as you do.  Like you said in another post, there is already some huge use cases for Bitcion like in countries with inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:12:47
That's not really true, the price will drop if there are no buyers, it's actually people buying that keeps the price from dropping too low.  people holding bitcoin do not affect the price.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:50:44
It’s free from gdax, they pay your fee

Share your pain lost a lot of money today
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:36:14
I can understand this.  I'm a very non emotional person and bitcoin has been giving me a ton of stress.  I hope people that do suffer from depression can read this and understand that this is a serious issue and maybe you should get out of bitcoin if it could affect much more serious things in your life.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:41:51
you might just be making money because ETH is going up and BTC down.  ETH/BTC is pretty consistent across the exchanges from what I have seen.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:49:26
so this is a bitcoin problem, not a coinbase problem?  And if I wanted to actually use it to buy something, it could take hours?
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:11:10
This is the best one yet
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:41:01
i always forget the volume numbers, is it pretty high i assume right now?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:34:44
Why do bitcoin cash people say it is better to use as a currency? What makes it better at scaling transaction fees and times than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:04:27
Why can’t the difficulty to solve a block be reduced to create &lt;10 min solve time?  Wouldn’t that clear mempool and lower fees and tx times?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:43
thank you this thread made me feel better to know other people are out there with the same issues.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:19:41
this is boring, i keep waiting for the price to go up, or down.  i don't care which just do something!  I need some entertainment on my Friday night
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:24:33
I did buy a little
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:41:55
They have been clever all along.  They always hVe been changing their patterns.  They try to get you to think there is a pattern then they do the opposite

nice, i'm back in baby!
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:46:19
its really not that easy, the price doesn't always move back and forth (horizontal).  Price is at 18300 as I type this, what if you sell 1 BTC at this price, putting in a buy order at 18200, but the price never returns to 18200, and instead skyrockets up, to let's say 20k by tomorrow, you just lost 1700 dollars by trying to make 100 dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:40:41
Will these channels open up automatically for me, or is that going to be a complication for the user?  I need something easy :)  And it doens't sound like it's wroth it for $2 a day, I might only do one transaction a day, still a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:04:28
so if a bunch of miners stopped, could the difficulty go back down and we have cheaper fees again?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:28:39
What is to stop someone from doing the short scenario you described? Would it be hard to find someone to agree to the $250m future you put up?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:22:04
 So the price to send bitcoin now is $138? Or am I reading this wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:38:57
But that’s why people are buying in right now.  And now they are scared off
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:49:51
Why so little talk about what the futures market's impact will be on bitcoin?  That seems like it could really impact the price, possibly even crash bitcoin, even if a long term future still exists.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:31
sent bitcoin to another exchange from coinbase, still pending over 2 hours later, anyone else having issues?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:50:03
Is it pointless/waste to buy a hardware wallet right now if it doesn't support lightning network?  I feel like my coins are safe on coinbase because of the federal backing guarantee if they are hacked.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:06:41
well if segwit implementation and lightning network come along to fix fees and transaction times, and BTC is still the  market share at that point, then yes I think so.  All of those things are likely.  I'm waiting on the sidelines though until the bleeding is done.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:17:50
that sounds great, thanks for the reply
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:51:54
Adblock to hide the sell button! That's some good "hodl" stuff right there!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:14:51
Those CBOE futures...
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:18:43
I just sold thinking as you do, but it was at 11800 2 days ago, so it isn't that much higher now than it was.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:08:21
When it comes back online you can buy at an even lower dip
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:55:43
yup, let's all sell, then whale can buy cheap coins and remove limit order
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:27:13
I think this is bad advice.  Hold has been good advice in the past, but that doesn’t mean it will be in the future.  Bitcoin doesn’t work right now, the fees and transfer times are outrageous.  Maybe it can in the future, but that is debatable.  And even then the value of it is questionable
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:35:30
Create a USD wallet on coinbase, deposit, then when a week later you can transfer that money to gdax to buy bitcoin.  No fees in this process 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:05:31
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:30:28
gdax, coinbase, bitstamp, and binance.  also will likely put some on hardware wallet once it comes in this christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:50:50
hard to say.  most of my money is in BTC but hedged by other top coins.  it seems like with this strategy you are likely to avoid too much risk.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:49:14
Because if bitcoin cash grows, it will also have to deal with a bigger load.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:29
If another cyrpto takes off and becomes a currency, that will be the new commodity.  could still be bitcoin with segwit + LN.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:48:43
must not have been that big.  17k here we come!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:14:38
so why does the difficulty retarget matter at all?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:03:54
I did not know that! thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:06:14
there is a roadmap showing they were only adding withdrawals, i think that's a little misleading.  it seems suspicious that bitcoin cash has been going up leading up to this.  don't you think some people took advantage of this information that was not available to the public?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:09
I don't think bitcoin is dead, but I'm not owning any until they fix the scaling problems.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:30:39
Why is the difficulty set so high? Can’t we have blocks mined in less than 10 mins? What’s the danger there?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:57:42
One of the other posts said that the mempool would grow even higher because of the increased difficulty?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:29:38
Because BTC is where the new money comes in, because of it's name, so if it fails, it kills the entry point for new money, and that is what was fueling he alts.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:40:05
I drink more because of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:31:52
Percentage wise, I think the orphaned blocks would be at the same ratio of the total.
Who controls the difficulty right now?  Is it a single person or company or is that decision somehow decentralized?
I assume if people wanted a smaller time, that would not require a hard fork which is good 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:19:08
What's happening behind the scenes?  
Would this still incur a fee on the blockchain 1) when we opened the lightning network and 2) after we completed the payment?
How long was the lightning network opened up, how much money was originally deposited on it? Could it run out of money?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:39:21
when coinbase announces segwit implementation we will hit 20k easy
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:14:26
So should we sell now and buy back in after it crashes 50%?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:33:55
so we can get 4MB blocks without hard fork?  I thought block size increase had to create fork.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:21:31
There weren't $50 fees back then though
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:31
why is low hash rate bad?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:41:33
There was one about mining one bitcoin a day lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:49:17
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:39:51
Well what if it goes down to 11k? Then I will make 2K.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:05
I read something along the lines of the mempool / tx backlog disappearing would be a bad thing, why would that be?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:55:04
who would sell right now with moon in sights!?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:10:17
I know lightning network is coming to BTC, but are some of these other things coming or already available for BTC?:
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:36:08
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:49:18
Why can’t they just reduce the difficulty so the miners clears all the transactions in mempool?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:59:38
is there really a bot selling 0.1 every second on gdax? How can you tell?
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:51:13
yes.  gdax does not have segwit, but they pay for your fees anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:06:56
What’s really killing bitcoin are the traders who are fluctuatiing the price with huge buys and sells to make people panic.  People were really in this to make money, and those swings are what scare people off.  If it had gone up slowly and steady this thing would be above 20k right now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:52:47
Sell the bottle you win and reinvest in btc!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:14:42
It has more use than gold does, do you consider that a bubble, too?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:38:16
if you hold, I would say worth about 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:30:57
Yes the price of gold went down once.  Good job.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:09:02
Are the people pushing B2X going to be invest heavily into it after the fork so that it looks like it's going to go up to other people?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:14:49
yeah I think that makes a lot more sense.  Or just need a little money for whatever so they invest less, and the lack of investment starts a downward spiral.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:26:56
Ask yourself why it's not worthless now - it's because it's value is derived from demand for it and the scarcity of it.  Bitcoin is similar.  If 1 billion people want / need bitcoins as a means of currency and store of value in 2030, then I wouldn't call it's price right now a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:24
so is that guy eating his testicle?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:44:31
sure, so would you call currency a bubble, too? people can invest in that, too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:57:47
I'm sure some win and some lose.  More probably lose, though, since there are %fees on each transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:44:22
I want to :
1) Deposit money from a bank account to Coinbase bitcoins and then at a later date 
2) Withdraw bitcoins from Coinbase and deposit to my bank account in USD
Can I save any money by doing any of this at GDAX instead of Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:13:29
Me too, I've seen the big round coin symbol but never see them on the shelves at Walmart, they must always be sold out.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:55:05
What if it only goes up 5% today instead of 10% like yesterday, is that a crash?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:00:27
did it just go up 100 points in like 1 minute?
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:38:06
They stopped because they failed... 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:30:04
if Bitcoin isn't valuable as a currency and never will be, is it still valuable for other any purposes?
Also, for investment reasons, do you own bitcoin or any other crypto currencies yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:30:35
They are just trying to save some face
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:19:55
That comparison doesn't make sense, bitcoin is different because it doesn't really have direct value like a car does.
