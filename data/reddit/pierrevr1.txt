Was an interesting year. Sold all my stack today - pretty much lost what I made this year -15k. Let the billionares play with their crypto- decentralized my ass...two billionaires get in a pissing contest over a shitcoin and btc tank...sell that to the world..cheers everyone.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:09:57
1800 get mined a day all I can think is most of that gets dumped some days.....
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:50:01
The only reason they would need tether for is to buy btc...buying btc drives up the price..if you look at end desember beginning january the most ever tether was issued and btc price was the highest ever ... so they are using tether to buy btc which drives up the price...more demand=higher price
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:55:14
Now everyone know why stop losses is your friend. ....And that 2 individuals can influence btc price dramatically...
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:52:10
If there was a buyer for every seller the price would stay even......

It can not be regulated unless you regulate the internet to access it..that's the whole point that is fking govenrments and banks both...so since the west is not China .. internet access wont be regulated and we can buy and sell BTC as we want....

Even though its more risky...much more fun than having the money in the bank for 5% per year....fk the government and the bank  ..i..

I bought 9k, 8.5k, 8k, 7.5k, 7k and 6,5k on the February crash. Made money all the way back up. I am confident it will recover in time so I will happily buy all the way to 3k. Instead of having the money in the bank i make a lot more here than any normal investment. If you think it will drop and stay low just go invest your money.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:10:31
He dumped 18k on 6 February, pretty sure he dumped lots the last few days. some one was selling loads of btc yesterday when it crashed.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:03:12
Guess all the dumb asses with 4k 5k and 6k predictions didn't buy any at 7.7k...already made $600 per btc on my lowest buys, all i can say to you fomo people is ..i..
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:48:33
Just hold it will go back to $9k+ once all the weak hands are out...
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:01:29
You have any proof that they have $2.5 billion? for the 2.5 billion tether? Any link? I could only find $450 mil proof
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:42:36
It costs around $2k to 3k to mine a btc at the moment depends in what country you mine it. This cost rise as difficulty goes up and reward amount halves. My opinion is that it will never go below the cost to mine it. So it will just keep going up in years to come. Unlike fiat which just get printed, btc cost money to mine and will get realy expensive when rewards halve again in 2020.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:42:09
Yea and they see $8400 and start buying.....
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:36:15

You answered my post...with some absurd assumptions that government can actually do something about crypto...once again ...don,t make statements as fact about things you obviously do not have a clue about.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:26:02
Might not even make $8200...selling slowing down on all the charts...
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:32:52
You would think that traders would team up and as they see the price go down all will pitch in then later turn it around and push it up again...hahah but no way ...as soon as someone gets it going one direction it gets stopped by a huge buy or sell wall...same with cars ...half have indicator lever on one side and half the other....humans.....
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:56:30
HUH..the more trading going the easier to pick up small amounts on the side....where do you guys come up with these statements?
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:46:13

@_date: 2018-03-15 14:22:44
I take it as confirmation that you are one of the dumb asses with the 4k predictions...how is that working for you?
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:35:03
I doubt if it will go anywhere soon....to many people got burnt in january and left the BTC market...they need to forget and make more money to loose before any major up I think.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:17:57
How is it paranoia if he still has 160k btc to sell. He already proved he is selling it on exchanges so you think he is gonna sit on it?
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:56:03
Good time to buy...whoever is dumping at $8900 like yesterday will run out eventually.....
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:20:31
They tax all profit so why not BTC. I am saying they can not regulate BTC unless they ban internet. All the experts here is welcome to correct me if they can come up with a way to regulate BTC worldwide. Would make for a great discussion.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:42:07
With 300mil USDT issued yesterday they should pump the price to 10k easy......Or anyone got another explanation why they would issue it if it is not for buying btc?
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:25:55
And the buyers beat the sellers once again...and back up we go slowly but surely.....
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:20:19
I implied there is tax evasion and tax avoidance. Go look it up.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:26:27
Its pretty significant if they have $450mil and 2.5billion tether. That makes a tether worth $0.18. And it is not assumption. There is the number of tether issued and here is the $450mil proof 
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:09:10
Ohh so you gonna declare all your profits that is lying in a tax haven somewhere so you can pay the government that is trying to fk you over on the crypto you are making the money on....absolutely amazing
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:59:28
My opinion is Tether did that pump . Here is why... 
$50 mil added since this morning [
Apparently  
The tether was added last night,
 Circulation went from 1 806 421 736 yesterday to 1 856 421 736 toady. Guess only $50mil entered the market so far. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:44:53
Top of your lip where all the shit you talk get stuck?
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:28:38
And for people saying I am assuming things....
that makes every tether worth $0.18. Scares me..do with the info what you like.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:17:55
You got no idea. Who said anything about cheating or not paying tax? Just because you roll over and pay whatever the government say they think you must, does not mean everyone do. You just make it offshore and have it taxed in a country that have 10% tax or no tax on that specific asset..What do you think rich people do with all their offshore companies. Don't make assumptions about something you obviously clueless about and then state it as fact. Seems to happen a lot on this forum.
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:09:54
I don,t think there is a cycle...it is supply and demand...more people want some .. it will go up... nobody wants anymore.. mining 1800 a day will kill the price....lots of people got burned with the 20k to 10k drop..lets hope they and some more new ones come back and the price will continue to go up...hodlers help because they take supply away...less hodlers the market gets flooded the price drop....so we wait and see.....
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:22:54
No idea who has that many btc to sell at below 8k..no fud atm
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:12:35
Damm I already sold for the $600 profit and is ready for the next drop..I suggest you grow some nuts and try to keep up....
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:17:35
OK see its dropping ... buy at $9010 .. put sell at $9110...do $8950
and $9050... split your money in 10 parts and do it 5 up 5 down trades...buy $9050...sell $9150 etc etc...do it all day long...make money....sometimes you'l fill all 3 or 4 or all 5 up and down in an hour you can split your money more like 20 and do 10 up 10 down whatever you like

Hope all the negative assholes on here is still holding for 4k.....
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:42:01
There is 1800 mined a day with many of them getting sold. But it seems like the downtrend is slowing down so maybe we hang around $7500 to $8100 for a while till fud or fomo happens.

@_date: 2018-03-14 17:47:22

@_date: 2018-03-09 18:50:46
Just bought 50% of my funds - 26k at $8890. Will just hold it till $9900 before I sell. Easy money next week. Will keep the other 26k to see if it goes to 8k ish over the weekend or ill buy $9500 if it goes up and keep it till $10500. Buy low ..sell high..easy money...buy with money you can keep...till it gets to the price you want.
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:47:26
 So he recons btc is going to the same price it was September 2017. Somehow with thousands of people more involved, overall good news for crypto and 2 months with heavy fud crashes where it never got below $6000, he thinks it might go $3500. At $6000 I will sell my house, wife , cars, boat and borrow every $ I can get my hands on and so will thousands of other people like me, and buy the crap out of it. Good luck getting to $5000 much less $3500.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:36:07
And it is those exact bots that will trade the price all the way up to 11k again...patience is a virtue....
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:19:32
No ball yet...so $9500 is on the cards.....
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:38:53
Don't be a pussy....hold....the bots will trade it up again in the next week or so..back to 10k+
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:01:19
So if you bought at $10k how the fuck are you loosing 80% of your purchasing power...just hold it till you back or over $10k...thus you don't loose till you sell if its below $10k. So dont sell at $9k hold till higher than $10k...maybe if i say it slower ffs whats up with people today.....
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:03:55
Wel I have proof they have $450mil... that is it . Anyone had proof that bitconnect had a trading bot?

Bought 50% of my funds...leaving the rest to see if it goes even lower...
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:53:32
Btc is purely supply and demand. That is what regulate where the price will top at any given time. The more people learning about it and want to own some, the higher the price will go. There is limited supply, so if millions more people want some the price will go up even more. Pump and dump will do it short term and fud will make it drop but it will always go back to supply and demand level. Lets make more people aware and the price will just get higher and higher. For instance in South Africa you are not allowed to own gold or trade forex without a license only banks get. Big market for people that want to trade BTC since government cant stop us.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:00:34
Now I have a question. If they are buying btc with the tether and cashing it out somewhere in the world, what happens to tether that people are holding when any kind of sh..t hits the fan or someone else issue a dollar pegged crypto that they can prove have a $ for every crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:56:01
The ban is actually good. Most ads are scams and trading companies duping people out of their money. I dont think ive seen a proper btc add just about btc.

 Look at the issue dates and how btc price went up shortly after...
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:27:48
Well he is the only person currently having 160k btc he has to sell that I can find in the news. It will have an impact on price in the next few months so something to keep in mind. Or ignore it and blame price drops on whatever you can come up with.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:47:12
Well volume picked up ...and $8200 is holding...
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:43:09

Well. if you started playing last year Desember you got free exp x 1000% and could have made whale in no time. At the moment you get exp one week and the next it gets halved or taken away. However.. if you slowly crawl up the leveling hill, you will need some shields against shit talking, fud and fomo, and with some luck a whale will not splat you halfway up.......

So it looks like they created acceptance of $1 = 1 USDT on exchanges when they had $450mil and 450 mil tether. Then after acceptance on exchanges people are happy holding tether now they just issue it in any amount, buy btc and the btc when they sell it gives them real $ anywhere in the world...its frikkin brilliant..you issue your own $ ...just takes a bit of trading
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:07:38
Try $100 a trade and 20 trades a day....
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:52:46
Actually I can guarantee that if its been going up for a while, it will definately go down again, and every down is followed by a up.
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:14:02
Let me give you an example....if that 160k btc from mt gox gets paid out and half gets sold immediately....more supply than demand and the price drops like a rock...if 18k sold in february dropped the the price to $6k, 80k or more being sold will fk it up totally...for a bit then it will recover to probably 9k ish again.....who knows
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:13:51
You never see it go up $500 in 5 min but it can drop $1k in 5 min like nothing. Typical world standard, Good things rarely happen by themselves , but shit happens all the time .....for no reason .,,,

Profit is already taxed.
What can be done is regulate/ban exchanges. If they make it extremity hard/near impossible to convert BTC into dollars then that's very bad. If it was deemed illegal to operate an exchange - that would be the death knell just about.
I don't think the government will ever ban Bitcoin or crypto but make no mistake they could do severe damage if they chose to.
I've heard talk of decentralized exchanges but I have no idea how those could reliably serve as a replacement for what's out there now.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:48:37
And tether is spending the first 70m of the 300 m...70m got added to the circulating supply on the 22nd. Guess what...price go up.
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:10:53
Doesn't matter if it goes to 7.5, then I buy 8000 on the way down. Monday 55k gets to the exchange and I just buy it all the way down to where ever. Once it goes up I sell it when it goes at least $1000 above what I paid. Just make sure its money you can keep till the price goes back up again and not borrowed money.

They don't do 100% profit trades. And when they get it wrong it pushes the price up...many bots = many wrong trades = price goes back up . .so as long as people and bots trade it and make fkups, the price will rise again
 
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:52:17
You only have to pay taxes on profit. Print your history of trading. Take all your money you put in minus all you money you got out= profit...only the profit is taxable. Go see your closest tax office and show them the history.
