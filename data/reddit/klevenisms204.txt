can you not take withdrawls at 9 thousand per day and put it in a short term investment through someone?
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:32:04
Sounds like a win/win all around
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:50:51
But wait..... There's more! 
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:13:55
mines not as crazy, but i had about $3.50 turn into $147 beacuse i forgot about a wallet but knew it only had a couple bucks in it
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:55:28
i agree with a lot of what you said.    drug currency.
i never bought any btc with the idea to hold on to it.   mainly just to purchase something i cant get at a store (yet)

If I had $ I'd have bought yesterday.   Can't count the number of people who said 'you lost 30%'.  I had to say I'm up 80% this month, so how am I down? 
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:52:43
this has gotta be a good feeling.
i remember i found a wallet with about $4 in it at the time which morphed into 150ish.  
 i count that as a win

Quadrigacx works
Seems you can only do btc/ltc/eth with it.
But I know from experience you can get money into your bank from it

Would it make any sense to buy this from him for $5?   What if their currentcy returns to 1/100th of normal

i rememebr when the internet first started showing up in schools here.   it was a shared ISDN line i think.  if no one was using it, it was pretty quick.
i do remember one nerdy kid saying something like "there will never be instant internet where you click a page and it loads in a second"

do you get a cut of any deposits?
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:32:03
honestly,  if that was to happen, id imagine a ton of people would get out.
in fact, those people who remortgaged their house invest in mid january 2018 would get out the second it breaks even
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:14:00

spent 15 cents a couple weeks ago to send $300
