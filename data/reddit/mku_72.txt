I think if Nvidia or ATI actually listened to the market and manufactured a card that specifically targets miners at a price point lower then graphics cards then YES they would not have this crazy problem.
Easy solution to this problem is for nVidia and ATI to manufacture a GPU card that has no output ports and place 2 GPU's per card. For example ATI could make the Mega 64X2 which is a mining only card with dual Vega 64 GPU's that have been slimmed down to only the critical components needed for mining.
Same would apply to Nvidia, there are tons of "junk" in the GPU that miners just don't use. Take that out and cram in more Cuda Cores and design a card just for miners.
Price it at a price point that makes buying normal GPU cards a waste of money.
Also make the card have a 1x port and not 16x or perhaps make it not have any ports at all but a USB port on and power port. This would be insanely helpful as it would eliminate the need for riser breakouts.
The first company to do this is going to make a crap ton of money.
I think if they really wanted to be creative, They could create a new miner product completely which would be insane.
Imagine a small box in a stackable form factor that has a SOC running an embedded linux and dual GPU's at a cost effective price.
Anywho hopefully someone from ATI or Nvidia reads this lol...

I cant be the only one that believes that there is no way in hell they have a 2 billion USD sitting in a bank account somewhere collecting interest. While this should be the case chances are they have this money invested elsewhere making nice returns. This however would also imply that they do not have the liquidity available to make the value of the tether 1:1 which would result in a significant price drop in tether and put a real scare into the market.
Since tether is no longer convertible back to USD, anyone with a brain would know better not to use it.

But the IRS says it's a "property" and is taxed as income, not as a currency which is taxed as capital gains... Who is wrong?

Coinbase just disabled BTC trades it appears...  Can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:14
Will it break the 17k support? We shall see :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:21:12
Just broke the 17k support, My guess is its not going to break the 14.5k support or we may be in for a wild ride.

Interesting, just must have been my account haha...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:45:45
It has tested this support level 3 times already in the past 20 minutes and bounced... We shall see ^_^

Gonna keep going down, stop losses are getting triggered it looks like. It dropped 1400 dollars in 5 seconds. Coinbase buy/sell is swamped and fails to respond.

I remember reading an article from a guy that was bat shit crazy claiming Satoshi was a time traveler that came back in time to invent the blockchain technology a decade earlier the intended in order to advert world war 3 started by the collapse of fiat currency to prevent a genetic mutation that was crippling the human race in 2148 from nuclear fallout. He claimed this is why he is no longer around since he returned to his time line...  I personally don't believe this but damn this would make an awesome SciFi movie though...
