I'm sick of all these elitist cunts acting like bitcoin is for them and them only. They talk about how much they are bitter about people not adopting bitcoin when they simultaneously push newcomers away because they are new to learning a WHOLE NEW FUCKING SYSTEM. It's really embarrassing to watch.  Every time I see these people I just imagine people trying to keep the email protocol to themselves, and shunning people that are trying to learn it themselves. As cool as a 5 year old hogging the toys. Let people learn and enjoy it too.

As described

A massive percentage of people in this subreddit are elitist and complain about lack of adoption whilst acting superiour and shunning new people. So that's actually very accurate.

Yeah so it doesn't affect anyone when the value is proportionally lessened ?

What are you doing on the bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:59:56
Nah man you're entitled to your own take on it but many people here want to keep Bitcoin as unregulated and free as possible.  Being central and regulated is against the point of Bitcoin.

Wank central, I bet you have a yellow Lamborghini and a small dick

what the fuck - he committed several crimes. He did wrong. so many retarded comments here. i don't see why he's being idolized, the idea of an open market is cool and all but he did illegal things that ended with repercussions. christ

Better start by supporting a criminal
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:01:28
Haha how are they doing that?
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:29:26

How would you possibly know that though?
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:27:32
Completely, this guy ran SILK ROAD, why are people trying to free him? He facilitated a huge scale of drug and weapons trafficking, so very clearly something you'll get sent to jail for doing

@_date: 2015-09-06 13:18:35
You should feel bad for caring enough to actually comment on it
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:59:04
Bitcoin is a perfect example of blockchain technology though.

@_date: 2015-11-29 16:16:06
