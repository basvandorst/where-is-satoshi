You are wrong dear sir. I want hands-on experience on the field and I want to be able to experiment with top of the line observatories so I can test my ideas. To do that I need to pursue higher education and have connections with people on my field. I can't just read a bunch of textbooks and hope someone out there will hire me.

I read until the "Quit school and work on YOU because school is a scam" part. What if I want to educate myself and get my doctorate in Astrophysics? Are you saying that's a scam?. You are delusional.
