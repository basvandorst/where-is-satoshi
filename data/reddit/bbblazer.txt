Wait so you don't like your own idea AND you don't really care about your family or kids using a currency in 120 years, or anyone in the future generations?   What do you care about?  Honestly...

Coins are traded in future value potential. Recycling coins reduces your share of the coins, even if it is in the future no matter how many years.  The trading value could go down because of this.

One issue is that people don't like it and don't want to run this silly version of software... That's a big problem.  If people aren't running it... The coins won't get recycled.

You are pessimistic, have fun doing that

By your argument, wouldn't people accept anything past their lifetime.  Bitcoin unicorn casino, where all your coins go on a roullette wheel in 200 years and get multiplied by 32.   Extra coins pay for mining and rainbow fees.  People will accept this proposal because they 'wont be around and won't care'.   Bad argument is my point.  What problem does it solve if we aren't around anyway.

Chart!  Yes I've seen a chart before, do I get points?

It's a trap!

Easy as 123 abc so re mi

Leasing rules, interest rates, and other rules affect the housing market DRAMATICALLY.  you are trying to change these rules, and these changes will have a dramatic affect on price.

Except there is incentive for older generations to spend the coins they have for value from the younger generation.  The economy makes the coins even more valuable, and since Bitcoin allows users to make transactions...the younger generation should have an opportunity to get a fair share based on the current rules.  Try your rules on an alt-coin, maybe it will be popular, but I doubt it and I find your solution inferior, but at least you are thinking.

So you are saying that mining and fees are/will be a problem.  
Many will argue that that is NOT a problem.  
To entertain you, IF you solved this 'problem' by recycling 'innactive' coins... I would argue that this direction is dramatically different than what was originally proposed by the Bitcoin project in 2009, and that this solution NEEDS to be explored as another coin or a split from the current coin.  It may work, but it needs it's own community that wants to see it work, not this community.

Thank goodness 2x failed what a silly idea
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:11:54
Then why are you here?
Inventions from 120 years ago have no effect on my current life.  You know like indoor plumbing and electricity.  Right....
You also didn't answer the question, what do you care about?

This idea is brought up once in a while.   My question is why?!?!  What 'problem' does this fix?.
Create an alt-coin with a baked in contract that recycles inactive coins every x years.  
This is not Bitcoin, this is some other idea of how a crypto currency should work.  For many users , the freedom to be holding and remaining 'innactive' for years ... Even centuries, this is a FEATURE not a bug.
