Why wouldn't you just derive the hex seed instead of the mnemonic words if you wanted to store hex?

Thanks but I'll stick with Bitrefill

Do. Not. Use. Blockchain.info

not true, but that being said, I still wouldn't use them at this point.

Looks like has been working on a fix 
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:12:12
How about  ?

And if Coinbase mysteriously vanishes? Or is ordered by the courts to provide identifying information of all vault holders?
There are other open source multisig solutions. I wouldn't suggest using coinbase.

Great! Sorry for my annoying questions, I still am learning about this stuff. Does that mean I will be able to import my mycelium wallet into breadwallet and vice-versa?

Cool, been looking forward to trying breadwallet. Is breadwallet a BIP32 or BIP44 HD wallet?

The thought of millions of noobs hodling in a bc.i wallet is pretty troubling.

They seem to be the most popular kid at the party with multiple wallets building in support for their buy/sell service(copay, airbitz, etc) 
I personally would not give them any of my personal information. Much better to use localbitcoins or something similar.
