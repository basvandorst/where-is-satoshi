I am contacting the DNS hosts. I assume you might mean the domain registrar. It was regged through the Russian registrar Reg.ru. From my past experience dealing with Russian hosts and registrars,  they probably dont give a shit and wont shut it down fast enough. However, I have emailed them already.

That is because they just updated the NS of bitistamp.net and switched to a new hosting company.
The new nameservers are:
   Name Server: NS23.JIXHOST.COM
   Name Server: NS24.JIXHOST.COM
Working on shutting these down as well.

**UPDATE**: I reported all of this information to the hosting company and emailed back and forth a few times. They have just taken the site offline! Go reddit!
**UPDATE  The scammer has updated the NS of the domain to NS23.JIXHOST.COM &amp; NS24.JIXHOST.COM. Working on getting these shut down as well.
**UPDATE  Put in a support ticket and called the owner of JixHost. Jose was very helpful. As of 7:51 pm US Central time, [site is offline again](
