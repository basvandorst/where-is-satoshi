Theoretically they could steal your Coinbase login, then use that to withdraw funds. If you're off the internet for a week or so, they *might* have time to both buy bitcoins and transfer them to their own personal wallet before you notice.

No it isn't. Speculators provide liquidity and produce the buy/sell walls that we rely on to keep the price stable. Uneducated speculators are a bad thing, but not the semi-competent ones who are pouring money into the BTC economy.

Yeah, in theory 1 in 1,000 results could differ on ONE of the generators and result in a steal-able address. If you want to be secure, it's probably best to test this with every individual live address that you intend to use. It's really just a matter of exactly *how* careful you want to be with your money.

Did your BTC ever go through to your wallet?

Be nice to see acid free printer paper/acid free ink for "permanent" paper solutions. Your call, obviously, but acid free is often used for scrapbook enthusiasts as it won't yellow/fade/etc. over time.

I've been waiting for the upswing from all our major media outlet attention. It's not here. I've started to wonder if it's even coming.
I've still got one coin left over from my past month of trading, but so far it looks like I'm holding it. Too scared to buy for fear of the price heading down, and too scared to sell because I refuse to take my unrealized loss.
My suggestion: spend some BTC, if you have any. Participate in the market. Don't hit the exchanges, don't trade, just support some of the new companies that have sprung up taking BTC. If you don't like any of them, or don't have any reason to spend/donate, then hold.

Because it's a cool tech concept. People pour all kinds of money into video games, cars, what have you as a hobby. For many of us nerds, bitcoin has the computer tech hobbyist aspect that attracts us, plus heavy influence from a field we're less involved in: economics. I know, for me, it's cool to be a part of something that forces me to learn, and very quickly, a baseline understanding of investment skills.

FredEE was helpful in the past, however since the recent major problems have started, I don't think we've heard anything from him. He made one post, 4 hours ago (the same time as his latest tweet on the issue) and it basically says the same thing as the tweet.
I want to see them reply to emails. I want to see posts on reddit. Blog posts. Anything.

Hence the need for a secure, distributed DNS service. I'm actually really interested in the [project using bitcoin's mathematical foundations to achieve this goal]( (partly for this reason).
MITM attacks against SSL sites are more difficult than you are presenting (not your fault; you admitted to not know for sure). You need control of the computer in order to perform such an attack, since the data is encrypted on the user's local computer before sending across the open web. The destination site's certificate is also signed by a certificate authority, which protects against "normal" man-in-the-middle attacks. So you have to run a "CA authority" server on your LAN or something, and forward the HTTPS traffic through a proxy server that is decrypting and signing SSL packets with its own certificate. Then you just tell the user's computer to trust your new CA (which you may do, since you control it) and you can can intercept HTTPS traffic on the way to its destination, forward it to the right place, capture the responses, decrypt them, and wrap them in your own certificates in a way that is more transparent to the browser.
In other words, they're secure unless your computer is compromised, either by your employer, government, or a cracker.

Look at it this way: I borrow 1k bitcoins, when the value of them in USD is $10 apiece. That's a $10,000 USD loan. I need to pay back 1.2k BTC at the end of 10 years to account for interest.
My business made 500 BTC in the first year, as profit. I paid a portion of this to my employees, a portion of it to web hosting, and in the end came out with 120BTC net profit.
The value of BTC inflates over this year. They're now worth $100 apiece. In US Dollars, I now must pay $100,000 back. But my profits, in BTC, decline in this timeframe (because they're worth more). My USD profit model goes up because of BTC deflation, and I've now made back the original $10,000 loan. But I'm no longer paying back the equivalent of a $10,000 loan. I'm paying back a $100,000 loan. I only made 30BTC this year, since my business grew but the value of a bitcoin decreased.
Fast forward ten years. During this timeframe, the value of a BTC deflates. At the end of 10 years, 1BTC is worth $1,000 USD. I now have a $1,000,000 USD loan, which is still only 1,000 BTC. I made 10 BTC in the 10th year. I can't make the profits required to pay this back, and my business tanks. I essentially go bankrupt.
This is why a deflationary currency, but especially a rapidly deflationary currency, is bad for debtors.

Yes. I don't blame the recent massive spike in value entirely on speculators. The boom was a product of a huge number of market factors, speculators are only a part of the equation.
One of the main advantage of speculation is there's going to be larger quantities of asks/sells at any price. Right now, I would argue that the BTC market actually had too few speculators to appropriately handle the recent boom in demand of BTC, which was not driven entirely by speculation.
This boom was driven by Cyprus, media attention, and hope for new and improved uses of Bitcoin. While this sounds like a good thing, it's not a good thing if the market doesn't have the liquidity to handle it.
So a massive number of people start buying BTC, but there's not a reasonable enough ask/sell base to satisfy this new demand. The way to get this kind of sell base is to have a market with a healthy amount of speculation, where there are enough sell orders generally available to satisfy this demand. Since we don't have enough sellers, the prices rise even higher.
This creates booms that are a result of Bitcoin being overvalued in the *short term*. There are many reasons Bitcoin was overvalued at $250 (again, in *short term*), including the instability of the financial exchanges that handle it, and the illiquidity (a good example of this is the massive sell wall, massive buy SLOPE at the $250 peak).
This also works the other way. Appropriate speculation will create a buy "base" where the market won't mass-panic, because it is liquid and large numbers of BTC can move hands instantly without driving the value of coins off the fucking charts. Of course, if we've already created an inefficient market by placing massive buy orders without a sell base to handle them, smart speculators aren't going to build a buy wall on a broken price point.

That's because the SSL cert is for  and you are trying to go to the IP address. The certificate doesn't work that way; it is certified only at the domain name and not at its IP. I assume this is because the IP address may at some point change, but  is expected to "always" be the correct address. This of course operates under the assumption that they don't change their domain name.
For the record, I suggest using something similar to [Google's public DNS service]( at all times, so that if you're on WiFi somewhere insecure you are at least hard-coded to get good DNS service. There are a number of things this won't help with, but it is an additional layer of security that I personally use.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:50:39
Yeah, it's just an example to say "hi, you can actually test this and the expected results can and should occur." Rather than going through all the trouble only to find out that one of the services is doing something weird and it's not even possible to work.
Consider it like a proof of concept.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:37:07
Yes, because your bitcoins are still being held by a third party. Look at what just happened with Instawallet. Their database got robbed. The attackers didn't crack into anyone's account, they didn't scam some group of people out of some meager sales transactions: they broke the whole wallet service, and robbed the bank directly.
As far as bitcoin goes, being a new service with few "good" companies supporting it, I would say you are 100% better off if you *own* the wallet that holds your money.
@_date: 2013-04-05 23:43:56
But the fees aren't zero. To get confirmations in a reasonably timely manner, it's like seven cents (and only going up, as the value of a BTC increases).
Granted, that's cheap, but it's not completely fair to say the fees are zero if you're also saying the transactions are instant, as many proponents of bitcoin do.
@_date: 2013-05-08 00:58:30
Yeah, except $5 million isn't much money. Yes, it's a lot for a Bitcoin business, and they can still do a lot with it, but this is only one business and it's only an exchange. I'm not viewing this $5 million investment in any kind of messianic light.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:15:47
As many people are saying, it's "the same as uploading your Bitcoin-qt wallet to dropbox." I do not consider this a secure way to hold thousands of dollars, though perhaps hundreds would be ok.

Yeah, [pcb]( in particular. If there's no circuit visible underneath, then it looks like that's a soldermask covering it.

For more absolute verification, you could do the same with brainwallet.org and the same passphrase. Then you would know with 100% certainty that the address and private key that you received was completely and properly tied to the passphrase that you entered.
Now, of course, I'm willing to bet that the open-sourceness of Bitaddress makes it highly unlikely that some such injector is even present. However, I haven't reviewed the source code myself, so doing the above would guarantee certainty.
But it's probably unnecessary.
