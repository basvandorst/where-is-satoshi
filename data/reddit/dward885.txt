A terrible feeling. Thanks for putting out the word. I hate to think of the amount of people who have been scammed and remain silent so it can happen again to the next person.

Can you withdraw from gdax to fiat easily?

Is it still not worth it to move a small amount to a cold wallet? Just wondering as Ive just been purchasing monthly for a while now and have built up enough to think about moving it. But last time I moved BTC it close quite a lot percentage wise.

Thanks for clearing that up. I've always been a bit confused by this. Haven't heard it explained so concisely before without having to read an essay. Thanks!!

What does this mean . 
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:34:04
So you still buy that amount of BTC weekly? Do you invest in any other coins?

I've been told to use gdax over coinbase, also using gdax for sending/receiving. Can you please help me understand why?
 
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:07:56
Thanks! So what exactly is an unconfirmed transaction? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:57:11
Exactly.....at the low point of BTC recently just bought more. Was planning on getting some alt coins but left it all as BTC and eth. ....... Best move I've made.

Cool. Good to know. Thanks you
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:14:31
Does this mean I need to transfer from my existing coinbase wallet to a new one or will it happen automatically? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:22:34
∆ this guy gets it. Under gdpr EU data held, even outside the EU, falls under the regulation.

You spelled news wrong.

I threw up part way through reading as my brain tried to comprehend what I just read

I threw my printer out the window in an attempt to destroy it after reading this post. It unfortunately killed my neighbors cat, which caused my elderly neighbor to have a heart attack and subsequently bite the dust. Their husband died last year so the cat was the only thing she had left. 
I've been successfully sued by the family and had to cash in all my coins to pay for it along with lawyer fees.
Next I'm I'll make sure to throw it out the window of my car while driving Vs the front window of my house.
