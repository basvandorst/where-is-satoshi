I don’t. The less they know the better.

How would you like to increase your cryptocurrency coin holdings? Send me just one bitcoin and in three months I’ll send you back 10 Ethereum. I know, I know, a 10 for 1 deal seems almost too good to be true but I promise I can make it happen.

What a moron. 
1. The coins would be moved to “some other location “? who gets to decide where they’re going? who gets to know where 1 million bitcoins are being stored?
2. There really is a limited supply. Already many bit coins have been lost through forgotten passwords and he wants to just go ahead and burn another 5%? I know in theory the less there are the more the rest of them are worth but we do need some liquidity to make this whole thing work and I’m guessing 75 years from now 21 million bitcoin’s isn’t going to seem like it’s quite enough to run the world economy. If you take the current worlds wealth of 317 trillion and divided by how many Satoshi‘s are in 21 million it’s already at 1.5 cents per Satoshi.
3. Why wouldn’t we try to do something good with them like split it up into 1 million different addresses and send one bitcoin to 1 million different charitable organizations or poor people or put them in a holding tank and Dole out a little bit at a time to people who significantly contribute to bitcoin technological advancements or something? 
4. Splitting up that huge pile and getting it out into circulation would help push the entire bitcoin economy forward as it will create more liquidity in the market and more incentives for retailers to adopt.

You can send me some bitcoin and there is no minimum limit. ��
For real though, what is it that you are trying to achieve? Is this a small amount of bitcoin business related? Are you trying to just send money person to person?

This guy is right, I can hardly tell the difference between a B and an S as it is. ��
