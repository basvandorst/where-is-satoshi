Which entites are responsible for the most non-SegWit transactions?

In 20 years it might look as cool as my Yahoo! tattoo.

You totally didn’t miss the sarcasm, there.

Here's how I think it might play out:
Phase 1: Early adotpers
At the beginning stage of growth for the network, there will be an awkwardly low amount of connections with early adopters, connected to just a few hubs. The network will likely have a relatively low degree of decentralization at the beginning.
Phase 2: Corporate early-accepters of crypto
The next phase will probably be large entities that appeal to crypto nerds like Steam (again), and others like the early accepters of Bitcoin. There will be a few hubs that connect to those entities, and people who want to do micropayments or medium payments will open channels with those hubs so they can buy things repeatedly.
Phase 3: Big retailers and other large entities
The next phase will be larger entities like Amazon, eBay, and others connecting to popular hubs on the network. When that happens, users will be willing to commit more funds to their open channels because they know that they can predictably spend a sizable amount of funds at those retailers. By this time, more hubs will likely have sprung up to shorten connection lengths.
Phase 4: Employers of connected employees
At some point, your employer will start connecting to the network, and can send your salary to you from it. So despite your spending of funds on the network, you should be netting positive (if you're a good saver).
Phase 5: Everyone and every company
Assuming the Lightning Network eventually reaches near-total connection to all entities in the world, there wouldn't be much reason to have much of your funds *off* the network.

There will be competition amongst hubs connecting to various entities, so other hubs *not* requiring identification could spring up.
Some hubs could be analogous to a VPN service for Lightning. They know who you are, but intentionally keep it secret from anyone else, and get identified themselves as the one doing the transactions.

Almost certainly. I don't see why it wouldn't.
But the more connected the network gets, you could commit more funds to it, since almost anyone you'd want to send money to would be connected.
And your hardware wallet could probably continue the role of signing transactions on the Lightning Network. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong on that one).

The gains in size made from block compression comes at the cost of CPU-time, since compression algorithms aren't CPU-cheap. It's all a balancing act.
