you have to apply for verification, once you do when you log in in the upper right underneath your wallet it will say, Your Position in the Verification Queue 1860

i been thinking it will climb to 45-50 then drop to 20-25 when all the ASCI's come online. Then will climb hard and fast to 100+ once the difficulty increases

blah not even a chase bank by me! Sucks being the the middle of nowhere in Michigan!! I have a Coin base verified account, purchased a few coins today wont be here until Thursday. 
I wish my mtgox Q to be verified wasn't so far back currently 1660 in line.
I guess ill just have to play the waiting game until then

coinbase is good if your looking to hold, mtgox is good if your looking to get your bitcoins right away and trade
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:48:48
hopefully soon so i can cash in on some cheap BTC and ride to glory again
