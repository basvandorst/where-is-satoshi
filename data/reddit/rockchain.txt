Thanks for the heads up 50 cents for you.

I had no problems with my CU and Coinbase. Can confirm.
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:04:59
I'm not an expert but as I understand you would just get the receive key from your wallet (I use Bread Wallet) but there are tons and post that key in text (or QR).
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:13:23
I'm on the cusp of switching to Circle because I hear a growing bad-ish rep of Coinbase, can you go into any details? Privacy? Coin security? Best practices? I'm interested.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:32:06
Completely speculative theory: The hacker created his own private exchange, being able to set the fees for prioritized transfer. At first, people were seeing $5 fees (if I recall) and now they're pushing the exploit further. 
Doesn't explain how they're still losing coin though.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:50:49
That ticker is likely going off of the BitStamp exchange which was just royally hacked and still down. :(

@_date: 2015-01-12 04:27:55
I haven't used one, I thought they only needed ID for transfers of $1k+, could be wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:37:40
thanks! Have a biscotti on me.
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:21:53
I wonder about just photoshopping your private key QR on top of another QR from print advertising or otherwise super inconspicuous piece of paper. Other than the trash can would that be even better?
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:50:15
I'm curious learning more about the anonymity or lack thereof of Bitcoin. Is there a difference between using an iPhone app vs desktop wallet in this regard?
Overall, what are the biggest factors in being anonymous with BTC?
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:18:08
I don't want my Changetip back but he's right, about a $3 difference I see between Coinbase and other exchanges. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:34:31
Can you get by without it?
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:32:48
That was sad, sobering and hilarious.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:26:11


What happens if someone buys BTC during one of these outages? The price fluctuated quite a bit today.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:30:21
Leave Erik alone! Besides, you think it will be saved by an ad campaign?
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:11:54
"So you're a nihilists" LOL
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:45:27
Is there an issue with Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:58:38
^ umm guys...what he said.
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:51:44
There's about 3 ATMs within a mile of me and as I understand the details of the bitlicense haven't been released.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:19:27
Less of this.

Ha! I was waiting for the flood of comments. Didn't load well on my mobile so I assumed the worst.

Fracking Bitcoins

The security vulnerability in a chrome extension with access to your wallet probably isn't worth it. Not sure if it exists or is allowed by Chrome's TOS. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:09:23
Looks like it's back up but something definitely happened.

@_date: 2015-01-10 22:11:20
Thanks for the thoughtful analysis, have a cup of coffee on me while writing the next.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:25:51
Would also like to know their strategy here for fee. Does Bitpay also charge 0% if it's converted instantly to dollars?
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:18:39
Just try it on wifi vs cellular data. If it's an ISP blocking, it'll work on one and not the other.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:16:02
Why do you think it's fake?
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:18:53
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:35:35
It's called diversification! They get it.
@_date: 2016-03-10 01:36:56
That's good to know! I admit I was uninformed of this and drew my knowledge on this from a Bitcoin podcast (can't recall the episode) discussion questioning using a browser-based wallet, but it sounds like this is buttoned up. Thanks for enlightening me.
However, with no "proof" I'm can't say I'm not skeptical of using a browser extension as my main wallet, but for shopping I can see the application.
Anecdotally, Google doesn't do the best job with preventing malicious code in other extensions which could be problematic: 
In terms of BTC, there has been incidence like  however maybe things have been improved in the past couple years.
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:50:11
Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:11:25
Nothing sketchy going on here, nothing at all.

He also taught me to be a cheap bastard but that messaging seemed off.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:04:40
I love adventure!
I also truly have no idea where to start. Is it completely random? Are there actual techniques for doing this? 
Good on you!
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:25:52
Thanks for this, I appreciate the time and best of luck with your dev! a biscotti

Nothing fiat doesn't do and I understand they have risk to manage. You'd probably be surprised how many credit checks you get without knowing it.
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:40:56
You'd think it'd show his history though...
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:12:17
FTFY: let's see if his social media teams collects it.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:15:56
I appreciate the quick reply! In the same tradition as my grandfather (who taught me gratitude), "here's a nickel." $0.05
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:15:20
Aaaaaand it's at $259
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:08:49
Of course the first items being sold are energy drinks, processed meat and soda.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:19:31
I think your graph may distort reality because your first arrow of growth doesn't show more historical context before the sell off. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:09:25
Nice shots! I was wondering about this for an artist friend. IMO it might look better if you just listed a public key in plain text. With the button it looks like any other site/donation widget.
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:56:31
Remember the time when KryptoKit mysteriously disappeared and no wallets could access them? This is a threat in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:22:21
Yeah, I went back to give you some measly bits and it wanted my email and looked jacked up on mobile. There are easier ways to accept BTC donations, you don't need a middle man.

Yahhh, 2 years ago I bought a pint of maple syrup with bitcoin...it was the most expensive maple syrup ever purchased. Imma just hodl for now. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:25:12
Or it's all relative and we understand the time value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 00:35:51
Typo. God actually declines me everywhere.
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:06:50
Same! God declined in a cab. Thought I forgot to pay a bill or something.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:25:40
I buy $x.xx of bitcoin a week automatically, anyone recommend a different service that doesn’t have such high fees (that’s allowed in the US)?
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:59:14
Does this mean anything for my tax bill?
@_date: 2016-09-15 04:08:24
Has anyone done this with a bitcoin application?
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:00:15
I'll try to grab another one tomorrow with creds.

Will it ever be feasible to buy shares of startups that don't require $1000+ minimums? Would love a platform that took micro-investments. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:16:26
Done, thanks for the opportunity. Would love to see your thesis!
@_date: 2015-03-26 05:31:19
Came here to say this.
@_date: 2015-03-26 05:58:02
What's the catch?
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:01:25
My guess is that your guardians were there at the time you created the account. Legal rights to ownership by minors is virtually non-existent from what I know (U.S.).
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:09:42
Because I think it's an interesting concept to include 'plebs' in the investment community.
@_date: 2015-03-11 05:01:24
Tippidy do da, tippidty ayyyyyy!
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:15:42
And pretty sure there are two P's in Application.
Edit: I was being a dick. Could happen to anyone. Glad you got your coin back.
