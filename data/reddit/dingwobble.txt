In general you're right about the stupid meme.
In response to the question, "what would you do if you had $100 a month to invest" it's a perfectly reasonable answer.
Context is everything.

Wait, I can have banks hold private keys for bitcoins for me? Where can I sign up to pay the banks for holding private keys for me?

It seems fairly inevitable. Why, what other nation with a sovereign economic system has lasted indefinitely?
Only question is when.

That's because the IRS considers Euros to be a currency, and Bitcoin to be a commodity. Different asset classes have different rules.
The classification is bullshit, but that's not exactly a legal defense to tax dodging.

It seems odd to skip pointing out that this is 2% of the total mining revenue, with the rest being the block rewards that are having again in half a year.

Thanks. I'm not sure I consider a 2015 roadmap to be particularly relevant or binding today (for example, what work has been done to reduce the stated risk of a block size increase and what has yet to be done?), but I suppose if they haven't updated their capacity increasing roadmap, there's nothing to see.
I don't really see lightning network top ups as a panacea, largely because they require an existing lightning network channel (or an on chain transaction making one) and because efficient routing naturally limits the useful amount of bitcoins locked in any one channel, requiring more channels and balancing transactions if it ever takes off outside of enthusiasts. For a long enough increase in demand, it could be fantastic though.
I guess I view what you're calling UX issues to be the biggest danger to Bitcoin. The biggest opportunity for widespread adoption will be in an economic crisis that drives millions of users to Cryptocurrency. I just don't see Bitcoin as being prepared for this kind of success.
That could send people back to fiat, but it could also lead to widespread adoption of some inherently centralized coin.
Then again, maybe just adding schnorr's 25% capacity improvements here or there in hard forks may be just enough to drive adoption assuming demand rises slowly and steadily to get people onto lightning.
I just don't see demand rising slowly and steadily for just about any other digital product in the world.
Anyway, if you see any more modern developer discussion of transaction capacity in the near future, let me know!

And that's why everybody hodls their assets in stocks and bonds. Hey wait...
Honestly, cash has generally been issued by banks, not governments. Even the USD is issued by the federal reserve bank, not the US federal government (although I agree it's effectively controlled by the US government).
Government backing absolutely has many advantages, especially over things like gold coins that are easily adulterated or even counterfeit. On the other hand, governments are always tempted to run up debt and then print money to inflate away the value of the debt.
It really all comes down to how much you trust your government.

We're explicitly told not to put much money in lightning network channels because they're in beta.
So I put some into a lightning network channel and... Now I can't pay for protonmail or anything using bitpay because they aren't on the lightning network.
Ok, so in the future, they all open channels and I can spend again! Except fees go to $20 again, but higher because this time there's even more people interested, so I can't refill my channel from my cold wallet until the fee spike decreases. Heck, I can't even withdraw money from my channel to a cold wallet until the fee spike is over.
Ideally a bunch of services open up to let me refill my lightning channel with fiat payments... 
I'm suggesting that this uncertainty is a big deal, and loading up a lightning channel doesn't remove the uncertainty. It allows more options in the case of a short fee spike, but it exposes you to a whole new set of security issues (known and unknown).
Is there actually a plan I've missed to increase block sizes in future hard forks? Or is it just rough speculation that it might be included once block size becomes an actually valid concern?
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:49:28
I honestly don't understand this easy dismissal. Do you honestly have zero concern over fees next month just because fees are low today?
Maybe you've positioned yourself to have low fees. Do you imagine a store relying on Bitcoin has no concerns that increased transaction volume could massively inflate their fees?
Or are you just assuming that any store or user that relies on Bitcoin and can't just hold through a spike in transaction volume should stop using a beta Cryptocurrency?
I get that the block size debate has caused everybody to call each other trolls, but I have a hard time pretending that transaction volume concerns are "invalid" just because you personally don't worry about having your coins locked behind incredibly high fees for an unpredictable amount of time.

No exchange should ever be fractional reserve lending. Ever. 
They don't have access to central bank or any Bank really, to lend them funds, and they have no deposit insurance.
Depositing funds with exchanges that promise to lend those funds to others at no benefit to you is just gambling.

Interesting how I don't pay any capital gains on the Canadian dollars I hold and spend when I go to Canada or in the pesos I hold and spend when I go to Mexico.
Almost like Bitcoin has been misclassified as a commodity instead of a currency.

Their inflation rate is stable... At 11% per year. That strikes me as double digits, although it's absolutely true that most of these countries are just over the line into double digits, under 15%.
Still, 10% value erosion per year is a huge penalty to savings, well over half disappears every decade!

Difficulty isn't adjusted to keep mining profitable, it's adjusted towards 10 minute blocks.
Right now, transaction fees are just 2% of mining income. When the block rewards are cut in half, mining income will also cut by almost half, driving roughly half of miners out of business (the less efficient half).
Maybe that's not a problem, but even price increases won't really help the issue because total transactions are capped at 2000-3000 transactions per block depending on transaction size. Miners can pull in a bit more fee revenue if all blocks are full (around 20%?) but that's only involving the 2% of total revenue that comes from fees.
In short, the security is going to be cut in half with each halving of the block reward.
Long term, maybe on the third halving from now that's not out of the question if we consider $10 transaction fees, but there's no way fees are going to jump 25x to make up for the 49% drop in mining revenue next year.
Long term, block size could also be increased to spread the cost over more transactions. I have no way to tell when that's likely to happen, or even if a block size increase is likely to be included in the next hard fork, given the political backlash any such discussion by developers would trigger.
In short, mining revenue is going to be cut in half. Hash rate will recover due to asic advances, but there will be many mining operations that are never profitable again given the permanent halving of total revenue (block rewards plus fees).

It's literally their job to keep it from getting out of control (or limiting the magnitude). If they ever call it before it's in the rear view mirror, they'll cause a sudden drop that they very much would like to delay as long as possible.
It's counter to their interests to call a slow down before it's obvious to everybody.

There's nothing wrong. Just speculators that are price sensitive.

Acquired interest is a term often used in acquisitions where ownership has been exchanged for something of value. One can acquire interest in an asset by purchasing it.
Do you have a source somewhere that suggests otherwise, that "acquired interest" only applies to interests granted without compensation (as in a fork or inheritance for example

Zimbabwe, Sudan, South Sudan, Argentina, Liberia, Yemen, Turkey, Angola, Venezuela, North Korea, Haiti, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Pakistan.
All have double digit inflation rates Except for Zimbabwe's triple digits, and Venezuela's 6-10 digit inflation rate depending on when you check.
It's likely a mistake to look only at inflation rates though since America's federal reserve bank has created a couple trillion dollars in debt in their attempt to manipulate the currency.
Can they pay it back? Absolutely, over decades if there's no major economic shock during that time. But they haven't started yet, and are accelerating Debt purchases, with another $58 billion purchased this Monday.
Developed countries have learned to hide inflation by trading cash for debt to keep inflation low, but debt grows and grows and the music has to stop somewhere.
@_date: 2019-10-29 22:42:54
Honestly, we didn't see it in the past because Bitcoin price doubled more often than the block reward halved. So mining revenue continued to rise through that time.
That's not an impossible result, I suppose. We could go all the way to zero block reward increasing security by simply doubling price more than once per halving.
That's a really long way away, so there's plenty of time to make changes! I'd like to see a roadmap to addressing the issue, but Bitcoin politics has made that essentially impossible.
At the same time, there could be security issues if more than half of hash rate goes offline due to a halving combined with a price drop. I don't see that as particularly likely in 2020, but I've never been great at predicting the future.

I mean, as long as the bank is fine accepting 2x losses when they inevitably fail to liquidate these positions automatically faster than the market moves, I say let them short!
It's not like Bitcoin hasn't been manipulated in the past and wouldn't be in the future otherwise?
Sure, you can depress the price any time you want, for just a few million dollars, with greater than 100% down side risk when somebody with 10 million dollars decides they want to go fishing for shorts.

Fees will have to increase to make up the loss of profits.
Practically, that means fees will have to go up dramatically since they're just 2% or so of total earnings right now, but a hundred years is a really long time to pull off a hard fork at some point to allow more digits and more transactions per block to spread out the fees.
