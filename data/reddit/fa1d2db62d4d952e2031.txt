How is this on Trump?

Cheers. Some of these ratings are a little off imo but I think they did pretty well given the volatility.

What can I say, I'm a job creator.  Trickle-down.  Give me 10,000 I'll make a *whole* lotta pizzas, I'll even hire a few more of ya'll.

Christ. Lots of socialists here. Take an economics and a history class for christ sake.

If there were an objective price then one of the parties involved would be a lunatic.

Was it Krugman? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:41:09
Yes he is. How do you figure he is not?

I'll volunteer to take payment. You will receive 1 BTC as delivery fee. It's probably going to be snowing, too, so wear warm clothes.

Seriously. You can not like him all you want but your entire post is discredited when you try to make some gigantic stretch like the President improving the economy is therefore going to create a bubble (because we know he directs floor traders on what to do) and thusly effecting the bitcoin market.
Its just foolish and shows the true intention of the post.
Down with capitalist dogs! /s

Sure I'll save this. Not sure when I can check it, maybe tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:54:17
Is it?  Bitcoin isn't regulated in that way.  Insider trading happens all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:42:12
I made no such statement.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:54:53
All jokes aside, that's pretty cool.

Can I borrow your crystal ball?

Isn't XRP down 20% in the last 12 hours?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:53:16
It's free between GDAX and Coinbase, and then I believe it's also free to move from ex to ex
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:53:08
Care to share why you think that?  BTC is not like wall street.  You have no crystal ball.  It could drop to $8k, or it could start rising.  You have no idea.

Like a little ASIC stick?  I might have one somewhere from like 5 years ago lying around.  Can't guarantee it works.
