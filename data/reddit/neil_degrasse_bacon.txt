You think it's a good idea to carry $16000? What if he had lost his bag? It's dumb no matter how you slice it. The only possible benefit comes from illegal activity.

I don't see how this specifically relates to bitcoin. He would still have that money if he had deposited it into any bank.


Debit cards are a thing. Checks are a thing. There is no reason to ever have $16000 on you, unless you are involved in something illegal.
Edit 2: You people are idiots if you seriously don't think a normal bank would have solved this guy's problem.

That could not possibly be upheld in court, as presenting such a case in court would defeat the purpose of any such attempt at that kind of regulation.

You accidentally discovered that talking to someone about something they're already interested in will influence them more than doing... not that. This works with everything, it's not limited to Bitcoin.

Well, binary is base 2, so to count from 1 to 10 you go 1 -&gt; 10.


Oh, so you understood the joke. Actually, I think it's more accurate to say 10 is 2 in binary. 1010 is 10 in binary.
