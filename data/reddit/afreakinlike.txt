Why not

Coinbase. No. All transactions are pending for BTC until August 5th. Try for yourself.

I can. I need to pay someone and with all the bullshit that's going on with BTC i can't purchase any until August 5th.

I can make this for an android and also make it any color you want. PM me. And slim for iPhone 7 just means it's a slim profile case. 
Edit: just added a ton of new phones to the site! Will add more colors later. Will be able to accept BTC AND LTC in 48 hours (API key was messed up by Coinbase). If you want to order via crypto PM me and I'll give you my address :)

With market fluctuation lately it's not worth posting a BTC price, it's just going to change anyways.

Interesting. There should be many methods available. Let me see what's going on. 
Edit: so I checked it out and ordered something myself. I was able to pay in any major credit card, PayPal, amazon and even Bitcoin. Let me know if these options aren't available to you!
