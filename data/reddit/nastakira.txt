Any pictures of the beautiful windows you have smashed?

I always talk like Batman. Typing like Batman currently.
You have a good point.

Glad you took the time to type this.

Hate to hate, and I know there were no rules...
But a lot of people took time and created original art work. Created concepts out of nothing, from their imagination and followed them through to finished product. It kind of sucks that the winning entry used the art of and artist who received no credit or winnings (who ever created that great looking wizard). And just  used some filters to tie them in with another copied piece of art. Just my opinion.

I totally agree with you! I was just being a jack ass.  
Though we usually don't give them phones. But the phone could have been sold to buy them something more appropriate.  
Edit: [Good Fer You!]( Again, just being a jack ass. Enjoy the gold. No, give it to a child that otherwise would not have internet gold.(I can't stop)

Thanks!!

I am working on a new one as well. More dots, more dots.

But the Fed actually is NOT part of the government. Look it up.

Very cool product! Using it now

The voice of reason!!! Just because you bought at a certain price, and the price changed (as it always does) does not mean that they owe you anything than what you originally purchased.

Thanks again! Having fun doing this. I would like to create something else.
 I think I will do something in color without dots/stippling.   Any suggestions?
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:29:25
Very cool
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:41:54

I think you missed the point. At one time AOL was the leading company in its field, had brand recognition, and marketshare. Look at it now.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:00:13
Yes and AOL is still relevant because it had brand recognition and market share.

Let me know if you need help with the graphics.
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:39:21
Easiest way:  
  
Click on the button on the top right that says "computer."  
Select the file, hit "start upload," and it will upload(no need to sign in).  
Once loaded, it will give you a list of links to the right of the image. Select the second one "Direct Link" and copy the text.  
Post the direct link here!  
Hope that helps.

On top of that, I feel like they are making things seem overly complicated, as apposed to finding the simple and readily available answers.  
For instance, was it really that hard to register with coinbase and wait? And was it really impossible to find someone local to sell him one Bitcoin?  
Imagine these guys trying to set up a bank account, or a paypay account. Or direct deposit, or automatic bill pay. These are all things they probably do or have done that require a bit of work and intelligence.  
I know all publicity is good, but I feel like they are doing it a disservice by exaggerating its difficulty.

No one guaranteed anything. I have seen the following statement so many times that it is cliché:  Don't invest in Bitcoins what you cannot afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:43:36
Step 1: Localbitcoins  
Step 2: Set up meeting at Walmart.  
Step 3: Profit!
