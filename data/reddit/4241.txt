hmm, but I already tried it myself and got both "wrong extension" and "access denied" errors. Maybe will test this later on clean W10. 
Also this person clearly skipped "looking inside archive" step. I mean,  if you see malicious executable, why extract all files at this point?

Meanwhile, [embassy]( was destroyed by government, about a month ago. Coincidence?

Also, this video is from this article, 
it's clearly stated that you SHOULD extract this archive on the /Desktop for this exploit to work. Otherwise attacker need to know you &lt;user name&gt;. I always thought that extracting files directly on your desktop is a veeery bad idea.

Всеж для проникнення "в маси" по-іншому ніяк, більшості людей все це занадто складно

I think this issue is greatly exaggerated. See more here:
So, basically, you should:
- download a shady .rar file from non-trusted source
- after opening, you see some **warning** about .ACE archive with a .RAR extension
- (*you are still safe*) looking at the content, see very shady **executable** file
- decide to **extract** it (why at this point)?
- if you have UAC turned on, see "Access is denied" error (*still safe*)
- now you should turn UAC off and only then you'll be infected at the **next** restart. 
People who do all of this, they can download .exe virus and run it as administrator, I see no difference at this point.
