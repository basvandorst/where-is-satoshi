Nice work!

I'm with you. I'm not going to sound out 3 syllables just to appease Satoshi Christ.

I thought it was a pretty good interview for fox. At least she didn't spew FUD in every breath.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:56:06
It's a loaded question. Don't feed the trolls.
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:36:13
That's pretty cool. Quite slow right now, though.
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:21:30
There's a difference between promulgating FUD and discussing it. She admitted that she was still trying to understand. She was inquisitive and let Gil address the issues. Overall, I thought it was a really good interview, especially for people that are on the fence.

Citation needed.

Well if it pans out, you'll have my subscription. Surely you understand the skepticism (and downvotes).

False. It depends on how it was compromised. This is why we have and want more alts running different technologies. If some aspect of bitcoin is compromised, we can swap it out with another proven technology. If necessary, the block chain can revert to the last good state. It's not perfect, but the tech can adapt -- IF it needs to. That's a big if.

Because they aren't stealing from you.

I'm not saying it won't fall apart some day, but we have 999 problems to address and this is among the lowest in priority. We don't even know if it will be a problem.
*also, the questions were rhetorical. Your ability to predict this problem is as good as predicting those variables. If it does become a problem, we can always adapt the protocol.

Now *this* is a ponzi scheme, kids.

And what will the average cost/hash, txn fee, and exchange rates be then? You can't just look at the block reward.

It's mad, but it's not uncommon among banking sites.

Send an e-mail to coinbase support. Ask to be whitelisted and, if you want, ask them to honor the original transaction. It will take a matter of days for them to respond, but this usually gets cleared up after a manual account review.

Precisely. Whatever you say, sqig.

I'll give you credit for persistence.

Did you mean 'for New Year? When you say 'Sent ... on New Year', you imply that it already happened.

Fark (reddit 1.0) was launched in 1999, which makes Drew Curtis look like a genius compared to Krugman.

25k $50 cases *pre-ordered* from the bitcoin community? I don't see that happening, especially with the current slump.

People keep saying that, but my rigs have been and still are profitable. Even if bitcoin crashed to $100, I'd still be squeaking out a profit today. Would I have made more buying bitcoin directly instead? Sure, but that wasn't the point.
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:01:25
I agree the post is questionable front page material, but it's not off-topic. Krugman is the preeminent Bitcoin critic. Everyone here knows the context.

Corporate offices are ghost towns right now. We may get some decent holiday announcements, but don't expect much else until 2014.
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:12:08


Hasn't the opposite been observed? People spend more bitcoin during rallies because they are wealthier.
