pigs are getting slaughtered. Why not sell out and wait for a lower entry? Classic stock 101. Bulls and bears always make money in these games. Don't be that pig that gets slaughtered.

People are worried because if China's against the use of bitcoin, then there $1200 bitcoins will more than likely not be worth $1200 again in their lifetime. We're talking 300M middle class folks that are told not to use bitcoins. Clearly, you're trying to be the honorable guy holding onto bitcoins after buying it at $1000 per bitcoin, but good guys finish last here. The smart ones bought in June and have sold in the $900-$1200 range. Bulls make money, bears make money. Only pigs get slaughtered, and the slaughter house is open. Clearly the price has dropped because many investors were selling out and someone will have to buy the majority of the bitcoins going out right? I bet they don't have market makers in New York taking the other side of the trade, so I'd expect bitcoins to drop further as these bitcoin exchange will become buyers, hence, lowering prices until equilibrium is reached.
My question is who was the biggest pig slaughtered in this scheme?

not if you file for bankruptcy. It's different than if the money to buy bitcoins came from your hard earned money.

Yep, because human psychology never changes! We get greedy and then fear sets in. History always repeat. Within a century, we'll be talking about another depression or big world recession again.

Now tell me how many people who bought into bitcoins with their credit cards are thinking that? I didn't say it was a good idea, all I mentioned was the fact that buying something with your own money and through a credit card is different. Why do you think you can't just simply transfer $5000 from your credit card into your brokerage account?

ah, but you missed the point. 300M oppressed middle class. I'm not even talking about the 1B commoners. The 300M oppressed middle class were targeting bitcoins, forget the commoners. We all know by now bitcoin started in China, did you think there were no purpose when the founder started? China cracks down again. The question now is how to potentially replace 300 million in MIDDLE CLASS. 
As for 1% with all the money, you think Buffett or Gates are going to dump there $100B into bitcoin? If I had that much money and I practically controlled the politicians, I wouldn't touch bitcoin at all, so toss out the 1% with all the money, because those ultra rich are not dumping their money into risky bitcoins.
