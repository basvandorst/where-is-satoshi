I can get Bitcoin pretty easy. Download the Circle or Coinbase app to your smartphone, link to bank account, buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:18:45
Naw. I wouldn't worry about that. Starting pushing up against 5k and I bet you get an email from them asking whats going on. Happened to me.
@_date: 2016-04-27 20:51:09
One might want to add... Be careful if dealing with larger amounts! You can bet your bottom Bitcoin that Coinbase and Circle will be reporting large transactions to the IRS.

When I zoom out to my year view - it looks like a pretty smooth curve to me. Depends on what time frame your focused on.

For some, its to leave a decent lifestyle for their family after their gone, for others - it's to finish that "last level" in their career. Why do people climb mountains or create paintings?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:57:23
And all those buggy whip manufacturers lost their jobs when cars came along. That's life in the big city.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:42:50
I feel your pain bro. Would have been retired by now if I hadn't made some huge mistakes trading.
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:49:28
Anything I have bought through Coinbase immediately gets moved out to a multi-sig account elsewhere. Bitcoin was created so you didn't have to trust a 3rd party.
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:47:48
Not only use Circle, but store them in a multi-sig account over at Bitgo.

Not for lack of knowing. I submitted it to them back on Monday at 1pm.

Uninstalled... saving spare change was all I used it for.

If they are freaking out now, wait until ZCash hits the stage later this year. ;)
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:19:11
Good enough for me to never use them again. Uninstalling off my phone as we speak.

My idiot girlfriend... who has 80k sitting in savings. I've pleaded with her to invest some fraction of that, but shes ultra-paranoid. I've explained how shes losing a good fraction of that every year to inflation, but she doesn't care. Money down the toilet...
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:27:02
Indeed. That only thing that really scares me about crypto is eventually were going to see it tied into a terrorist attack and some governments are going to attack it full bore. They wont kill it, but they can certainly put a dent in the prices.
@_date: 2019-03-12 14:17:23
Well that's a pretty narrative you have there... It would be a shame if someone came along with facts and ruined it.  
@_date: 2018-10-30 21:07:07
Lol, let me guess, your one of those state worshipers who think the collective has some divine right to rule, like the divine right of kings? Superstitious mystical nonsense. Statism has to be the worst religion ever.
@_date: 2016-06-10 00:25:50
Or one can just bank wire to BTC-E and avoid all this silly KYC nonsense.
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:40:32
Doesn't matter who speaks up for Bitcoin or not. Bitcoin needs no spokesman, and to think that McAfee is trying to be that is to miss his point.
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:29:27
If you dont control the keys, it can be taken away from you. That said, keep in mind if you decide to cash out to dollars, its considered a taxable event.
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:19:17
And the IRS will come down on you like a ton of bricks otherwise. Pick your gangsters. ;)

Greatest reply of the year...
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:48:45
Doesn't matter if it can be tracked. All they would need to do is exchange it on some exchange that doesn't have the KYC crap for Monero or Zcash, then in short order, change it back on some other similar exchange. It's child's play to launder crypto.

Go back and review the battle between VHS and Betamax. Betamax was better technology, but VHS got the adoption. Being better doesn't automatically equate into adoption at all.

I'm a full member of Alcor and will be frozen when I die. I've pondered how to secure my Bitcoins such that I can recover them. The problem is that any technology capable of repairing neurons on such a level, would be also most certainly be capable of extracting any information stored in them. The people reviving would be able to steal your keys. This goes for anything you can remember, so even if you didn't know the keys specifically, and buried them... the revivers would know where you buried them. How do you secure something such that you can recover them without having any information about them?
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:52:59
As I said, they can't kill it, but they can crush the price.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:21:52
Whenever I hear anyone mention the bubble word, I ask them to tell me if the number of people pioneering the Western USA is in a bubble, and when that will drop back to zero. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:42:09
My concern is this could trigger the immune system of state resistance. They can't stop Bitcoin, but they can outlaw it. They can easily drive the prices back into the basement. Bitcoin was the frog in a gradually warming pot. Libra is pouring hot lava on the banksters. If they were concerned before, they will want to go to war now.
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:24:54
Like anyone else in the world. Sign up at an exchange that doesn't require ID verification.
While a bit dated, here's a decent list.

Now that's funny... an economist who actually comes out and admits their scared of it. At least he's honest!
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:56:20
Indeed. I suspect once we get to 1% or so, the antibody self-defense mechanisms of the current system will start to attack crypto, like the virus it is. ;)
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:50:29
Bitgo for sure. Love that multisig!
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:54:23
I thought the same thing. All I felt safe pulling was 4k, but I could have pulled 10k :(
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:47:03
Eh, I don't need to, but I do think it's a smart move overall to take 5K and drop it over. I seriously doubt the stock market will keep going up like it is, and I think Bitcoin is here to stay and has a huge upside coming.
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:31:58
Indeed. Kicking myself for selling some off at $150.

That's what I did back when Bitcoin was $30. Best return on my investment I ever made!

I feel your pain... I lost a LOT of Ethereum in a really screwed up trade where I didn't understand liquidity and market/limit trades. I could be retired right now except for that. Most expensive lesson I have ever learned.
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:35:14
Because there is more variables than just the power costs to produce? Liquidity, utility, costs of hardware to turn up a mining system, projections of future value, etc...
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:33:47
Ugh, one of those people who frames everything in terms of parties.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:47:37
What evidence is that? Not contradicting you, but interested.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:53:44
I have been involved with crypto for years, as my profile can attest. I dont get my information from some "one". Anyone that even remotely understands crypto gets that it's a new ecosystem. If that isn't visible, then you haven't learned enough about it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:55:13

@_date: 2018-02-04 22:15:03
All those people who saw it recover from every other crash before and understand its not going to simply magic itself out of existence. Feel free to short it with your money however if you believe the contrary.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:00:07
Not to mention, think of all those people who used Mnt Gox... Given that it's out of business, all those records are effectively gone.

The difference is this is the inflation of a new ecosystem that isn't going anywhere. This is much more like the gold or land rush of the West. Those who get choice property first will win and stay winners.

There are a number of ways to discuss valuation. First, let's assume a best case - world currency adoption. We have 21 million BTC spread among 7 billion people. The average wealth per adult in the world is $52,800 according to Credit Suisse Research Institute’s Global Wealth Report 2016. So if we multiple $52,800 by 7 billion - we get a total of 369 trillion in total wealth. Divide that over the max of 21 million bitcoins, we see that $52,800 is equivalent to  0.0000001 BTC.
Even if we are off by a factor of a million, that brings $52,800 being equal to .0568 BTC (or $929,577 dollars per BTC).
Push that to a factor of a trillion, then $52,800 is worth 56.82 BTC - or $929 per BTC (which we are already past). 
All that said, what is worst case? All the major governments of the world outlaw crypto today and they all go to a fraction of their current value.
I imagine the reality will lie somewhere between the best and worst case - but with that said, we have at least a few orders of magnitude up in valuation we can go pretty easily.
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:29:37
I agree, its not necessarily bad. If it gives them enough confidence to allow integration into the economy, then so be it. It's easy enough to sidestep. Let them have their pacifier until sidechains or some other similar technology goes live. By the time hell breaks loose, it will be too late for them to do anything about it.

Why not just use Augur? It's already there.

Well, I understand the skepticism, but in this case - my friend was looking to hop into Ethereum while the price is low. She was worried that the price would spike up today or tomorrow. Luckily, it hasn't so we bought a little time it seems.

I absolutely agree, national cryptocurrencies suck... that said, their market cap will inflate to some point once created, and there's some very nice profits in there to capitalize on before they die. Bet on them growing, then bet on them dying.

No doubt. First rule of Bitcoin fight club is to never publicly reveal how much you have. Good way to end up in a basement somewhere with some thugs standing over you with a bat.
