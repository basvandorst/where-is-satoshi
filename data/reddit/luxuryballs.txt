How is this different from a credit card company or PayPal settling a transaction on behalf of a company? They don’t have to roll their own system in order to accept electronic payments. Either way if the end user experience is bitcoin -&gt; coffee it’s all the same.

A credit card processor is the same thing, Starbucks accepts credit cards, but not because they are the ones providing credit or interchange networks. This is totally par for the course B2B merchant services allowing them to accept bitcoin.

I mean this is a total dodge answer but isn’t it up to quantum computing to prove it can do something not the other way around?

so if you ever film someone getting killed just edit in a weird moving palm tree?

I don’t see why it can’t be censored, you could just block it on the network.

well shit and I thought I bought the dip *today*

yeah but if he is doing it on some court order then he can’t just wait for his massive sell order to get bought up
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:23:09
yeah plus everyone should have more in their paycheck from the tax cuts, so if Trump isn’t your President then you can pretend by using that money for bitcoin as if you never had it, free bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:27:47
yeah that’s what I am imagining every time I buy it for $9k

Yep, and they also periodically adjust the rotation rate to keep pace with the ever increasing pixel densities.

isn’t it just kinda like inflation? there’s more bitcoin on the market now, if demand didn’t change as fast as the supply went up... then the price should go down, it’s behaving properly
also I would assume if they did a market sell then they just ate through a bunch of buy orders in order of highest to lowest? but I don’t know enough to be sure of how that works
edit: wait maybe that’s the same thing, if I accept the top 10% of buy orders then that demand is cleaned out instantly and the highest price would be the top of the remaining 90% of orders, all because of more coin being added to the market
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:26:43
those are some serious strong hands my man

The USD numeration is a record high but I wonder if it’s adjusted for inflation?
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:17:14
I dunno, this time we’re going to sell if it goes up, paradox
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:17:35
Also wanted to add that inflation “helps” here because each year the debt is paid with cheaper dollars than it was taken out with. I say “helps” because while it does make paying off debt easier, it also hurts the currency in the long run, and punishes people who save money.

had to scroll much too far to find this

Let’s be realistic the writer is probably hodling.
