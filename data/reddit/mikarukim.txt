Yup exactly.

I think you're mistaking analogies with your hard-on for bitcoin.

This is assuming that there are arbitrageurs actually performing arbitrage to take advantage of the discrepancies, however there doesn't seem to be much arbs taking advantage. I wonder why /s?

No they're just implementation of the same technology at the end of the day, lots of internet tech isn't cross compatible at times. There's things that create cross-compatibility but at the end of the day, it's based on the same thing.

Securities on a derivative with extreme volatility likely will result in high tracking errors. It's basically a derivative of a derivative of a derivative... Sound familiar?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:27:11
I think this is very true... Scary...

Convince me how Bitcoin is the Internet, wouldn't Blockchain be the Internet?

There's a lot of smart people haha, I think blockchain is quite interesting. TBH I don't know if it'll be revolutionary as the internet but its interesting, just like other cool tech that's come and gone...

Yeah but there's something called pivoting and changing business model. Amazon and Google survived because they adapted and shifted. Problem with cryptocurrencies is that they can't all of a sudden change function and adapt for different use unless you do something that basically nullifies its original purpose.

Not saying they'll buy-up cryptocurrencies, I'm saying they'll make use of a variation of their own - maybe to facilitate clearing activities faster (which is I think the most useful case of blockchain so far) which could reduce sg&amp;A overhead.

Think you've got it :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:26:21
Convince me please instead of saying I don't know wtf I'm talking about. If you are so adamant this is not a repeat of 2000s dotcom boom because it has too many parallels to ignore.

I think 80s to 2000s saw a shift from wall.st to tech, and then money went from tech to wall.st in 2000s- 2008s, and then 2008s to now is another shift from wall.st to tech... I see FIs gobbling all the remnants of cryptocurrencies and making it a big thing for them soon enough after dust settles...

Problem is these "anarchists" believe media is for sheep ;)

no more like .ai

Blockchain is a tech-concept... Just like how the Internet is... You use it by configuring the implementation of it such as email, websites, etc. Similar to how blockchain has bitcoin, ethereum, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:22:42
You're now making no sense... You just said bitcoin is a implementation of blockchain just like email is to internet...
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:36:00
Absolutely true.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:03
Holy crap over 1300?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:42:01
I think you're actually right...
