This. Finding hidden issues with any investment should be  on your  to do list as an investor. If you try your best to find all the negatives you can think of and still like your investment then it's a keeper.

Of course there is no magic formula. I just found it interesting that they match so well. The could very well diverge tomorrow.

The point is that not everybody waits. Many people try to catch the falling knife and only a fraction actually succeed. it's better to miss out on a 15% profit and buy after the trend shifts than trying to predict the bottom and lose 50% because you were wrong.

What about if there's a giant weakness in the system somewhere that no one talks about? It would be in everyones best interest to figure that stuff out and solve problems before they cause issues that could cause price drops or cause trust issues.

FOMO doesn't exist on a bearish market. FOLFE takes over. "Fear Of Losing Fucking Everything"

So this could already be going on?

How do we know that is is not already happening? If 2 different parties  cooperate with 26% of the chain each.

Sell half and cash out $18k. That way you can get the best of both world. You get a nice amount in cash and you still have the remaining 4 btc in case of a future rise.

Mp3 players were also revolutionary but they are worthless now. The first of a kind always gets replaced when it comes to technology. Blockchain is here to stay, bitcoin might or might not.

So what is actually better with bitcoin compared to say Etherium or other alt coins?

A banana tree is worth a lot more than a single banana. I'd say a banana tree is probably worth around $100k. You heard me. Board the banana rocket cause we're going to the moon.

Good argument.
My point is that the token doesnt have to be bitcoin. It can be any token.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:04:02
You are an idiot. $10k is a life saving for some people.

just because something crashes doesn't mean it doesn't recover. A 52% drop is a crash.

It can adapt but only to a certain extent. There might come an alt coin with a far superior build that takes over. Etherium isn't close behind. What's the argument for bitcoin if Etherium passes it in market cap? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:37:38
The only correct answer. How much is a dollar worth? About one dollar.
