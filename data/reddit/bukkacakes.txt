Okay thanks.

Where should I be buying Bitcoin? It seems the consensus is that Coinbase is no longer trusted, and that's where I've previously bought coins.
@_date: 2018-09-21 17:13:01
So what happens when people are no longer competing against each other to earn bitcoin because it has all been mined?

You’re the one trying to argue that his right to free speech is being denied..

“Disgrace this is allowed to occur in the U.S.”  
Who do you think OP is saying is allowing this to happen?

No it isn’t lol. If someone breaks the terms of service a company has every right to cut ties with them.

For some reason I was under the impression that all bitcoin would be mined in 5 years or so. My mistake.

This is the most cringe post I’ve seen on this sub and that’s really saying something.
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:40:09
Nothing. It’s a very strange shitpost.

Right that's what I did, but it won't let me click next when I sweep the keys in the electron-cash wallet. The app seems to be having issues.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:48:32
Thanks! I will do this when I get home.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:09:03
That took a lot longer than one second.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:35:07
Thanks. I have OSX so I'll try to get it running on windows.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:29:55
Can't sweep them. I can't click next when I enter my seed, and I can't click next when I try to sweep my keys from my Electrum wallet. Assuming it is a problem with the Electron-Cash app itself. Are there other BCH wallets that allow me to sweep my private keys? Appreciate any help.
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:40:06
Yeah, lesson learned. I was actually trying to get onto Cryptsy to do just that.

There’s a very low risk of loss? Bitcoin is down like 80% in the last year.
