Don't you think raising awareness by shining light on the AWESOME BTC entrepreneurs that think their community would come out for a Free Ice Cream cone thanks to anonymous internet users is worthwhile? This will peak a lot of peoples interest showing them phsyically that they could get a delicious ice cream cone with something other than their rigged legal tender.
Why don't you think there are enough people here to donate $200? That's like 100 ice cream cones!
