Let's be honest, that's just simply [not true](
Ethereum may have a higher ceiling than Bitcoin's because of differences in some parameters. But at its core, the Ethereum blockchain, while a generalization of Bitcoin blockchain, is still largely the same blockchain conceptually. With all the fundamental scalability issues to overcome as Bitcoin.

*Ad hominem* doesn't convince anyone if you want to argue his points.

Batch input transactions. I see a lot of transactions with like 100+ (SegWit) inputs and one (SegWit) output in a single transaction.

He's not wrong. Compared to ETFs and the stock market (which some already call gambling), they're both gambles.

I did concede not at this level of security, didn't I?
My point is that the ETH network handles the same order of magnitude in terms of scale.

Seriously. Wealth inequality =/= generational gap.

You could have just said that a terahash in Bitcoin is much cheaper to obtain than a terahash in Ethereum because of ASIC and leave it at that.
There's no need for the vitriol. Why are people so emotionally invested and treating crypto like sports teams, it's not healthy.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:52:17
Maybe not quite at this level of security, but Ethereum is definitely in the same scale magnitude, I think.

Memory fails.

When you know the answer to that question, you'll have mastered the Market and become god.

I'd imagine their transaction processing software would employ a simple heuristic, looking at the latest transactions that went through within 0-x blocks, and use the median fees there.

30 withdrawal events, not 30BTC worth of withdrawal.

hello, where have you been?

How the hell do you get evicted only days after taking a mortgage?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:06:48
Sounds like he doesn't understand how mortgage works.

It's inevitable, really. Just with any piece of new technology. Once mass adoption nears/comes, monetization begins.

It's also very unlikely that future forks would fork at a block height **in the past**. Forks usually have to designate a block number **in the future** at which point protocol rules diverge. 
So, future forks would have to deal with blocks in that future's past that already contain segwit (p2sh and bech32) addresses, and be able to redeem their values. It's already a point of no return, unless that fork would just say," fuck it, after the fork (protocol rule change), any non-legacy script will simply be irredeemable."

Figures, the one calling everyone else "fake news" being the one actually peddling fake news.

Wouldn't the only way you know that seed keys work *for sure* is by performing a full restore, anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:09:26


Math doesn't check out. Blocks are mined at a rate roughly ~1 block per 10 minutes. At most, you could've gotten only 3 confirmations in half an hour.

My credit union refunds me of any ATM fees I incur at the end of each month.
So I have a bigger selection of ATM than you. I can use Chase's, or Well Fargo's, or BofA's, or that random ATM machine in 7-11 with ridiculous fee. All these fees get refunded to me at the end of the month. Credit unions are just better.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:27:04
I'd say, first, understand cryptocurrency and how they work?

Every other exchange that implements KYC is swamped with a massive influx of new customers/investors after BTC shot through the moon recently.
I suspect if you try registering with any of those KYC exchanges you'll be time walled, too.

Spend, **or receive** funds. The hardware ensures no private keys enter any computer.

I bank with a federal credit union who *refunds* me any ATM fee I incur[*], so essentially I can use a bigger selection of ATM anywhere in the country.
[*] As long as I satisfy a minimum # of POS transactions in a month.

Now *that*'s fake news.

You hear about it all the time. Lost keys, mistyped/mis-pasted destination address, etc.

Man, I keep forgetting how relatively \*new\* thing bitcoin is...
