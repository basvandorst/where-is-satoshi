Now he is pushing a private equity investment fund based in the Cayman Islands which is basically a fund that is invested in a garbage company in Minnesota (yes it is literally a garbage company).
The fund will be paying the returns by lending money from the bank and from them lending money to the buyer of the funds. He might go to jail again.

13 years? It's been around since 1971. So about 45 years!

Wait a minute, I saw the movie and in that they were the bad guys! 
But hey, who knows. If bitcoin changes the world maybe their place in history will be greater than their rival Mark Zuckerberg.
But, to look at it from a critical perspective this isn't only a good thing. I guess this pretty much open Bitcoin up it to be leveraged by Wall Street and the rest of the world, making bitcoin even more volatile, for good or bad.

Is Turing languages more open to manipulation/complex than others? Or is it just the fact that adding a new layers means more vurnerable system you are getting at?

Ripple is probably the most successful cryptoscam ever in terms of monetary value, with DASH being a close second. But I give DASH more credit because of their masternode scheme and how they hid their premine. Ripple is just a 100% premined scam heavily marketed and artificially pumped with monetary manipulation, by locking up tokens, inflating the market cap and creating scarcity.

This is ridiclous. I've waited a day for one transaction to go through.

You're right, DASH was instamined. I think their instamine is around 35%, but because of the masternode system they can pretty much own the whole network due to masternode staking system, no way of knowing. 
The ethereum premine is around 80%. The fact that Ethereum will go into Proof-of-Stake with such a large chunk of premine also makes me wonder.
But Ripple doesnt bother with a scheme like DASH where it gives them a possibility to deny, they just flat-out scam people with a 100% premined ledger basically. It shouldn't even be considered a cryptocurrency.

Try  it might help you. I just managed to accelerate my txn, don't know if it works.
The txn id is a number you can find in the info of the blockchain transaction.

Can you explain why?

Well basically they first split the DAO in two during the hack to save the whole DAO from being drained. So there was two DAOs, one was the attacker and the other was the RHG (Robin Hood Group) / WHG (White Hat Group).
Then later on ETH forked, and the ones that didn't agree to their bailout continued mining on the ETC chain. Since the two DAOs was still on the ETC chain, there was one DAO that was controlled by the WHG/RHG and one by the attacker.
The DAO that was on the ETH side, has a contract that people can use to withdraw at any time. But in ETC they had a contract where the remaining funds that wasn't refunded would go to a multi-sig that would be "donated" to "security auditing". So not only do they create the massive failure called the DAO, they are letting the ones that paid for their failed smart contract, pay for their (whoever they are) future "security auditing".
They have extended the contract two times, it ended at the end of 2016 if I remember correctly, then it was extended 2 months, and now it will be extended to 2018. 
One can only speculate but since their lawyer seemed to have quit representing them at the same time they extended the contract for the second time they probably realized it was a bad idea since people were apparently waiting to press charges. The lawyer pointed out Jordi Baylina as the person that is the representative of the WHG, and Alex Van De Sande (avsa) was the previous spokesperson.  I would assume the delaying of the contract is a way for them hoping that people will stop noticing it so they can commit the theft outside public view. 
The problem is that as ETH price increases, so does ETC. So while their "donation" was only 3 million at the extension some month ago (when they were going to steal the money) it is now worth close to 30 million USD. If the price continues to increase, how much money are they going to get away without people raising an eyebrow? 
So, in short, they are trying to steal 30 million USD worth of ETC, which rightfully owner is the owners of DAO-tokens before the DAO hard-fork. 
I've written two older posts on how people from the EF acted in the DAO hack and the ETC refund. You can read them if you want to hear a different version than the one that is offered by these guys. 
Regardless if they do or don't extended the contract indefinetly or do an instant refund, I would argue that in the eyes of the law they have already commited an criminal act and can be prosecuted. That is why they are rogue.
I do however wonder why Jordi and Alex seemingly volunteered to be the representative of the group. I guess they maybe received economic compensation by being the first ones that gets taken to court first if it ever comes to that.

The DAO investors refund contract is open forever on the ETH chain, while the ETC refund has a set time when the remaining funds in the contract is going to be sent to a multi-sig wallet. They have extended it two times. First one was two months and recently 9 months.

But just because "code is law" doesn't mean it is not morally right. The problem is that the people that did the "white hack" and created the refundable ETC contract is people from or who has ties with the Ethereum Foundation and the DAO. They are all still active in the community, some are behind ICOs and other things. They are the ones that supposedly has a moral highground over ETC.
The hypocrisy is at one point fork to save your friends money (there are ethereum protocol devs that bought the dev premine that had millions in the DAO), but then when it comes to ETC don't refund them and flatout try to steal from people that haven't used their refund. 
They are still the people that bought into their (DAO) smart contract and the money is rightfully theirs. To mess up in the way they did with the DAO and then claim that the money they are stealing from their own investors is for security auditing is just the icing of the cake really.
Even if they had decide to not fork, not refunding it would still be immoral, because they are stealing from people that have invested in their project. To me it just shows me that the people in the EF don't care about principles or morals, or trying to seem as the "morally rightous" fork. They care about one thing, their own money.

You are abiding criminals in every sense of the law. Why don't you instantly refund all the ETC holders? Answer that question. Answer is not that you can't do it, you are only extending it, hoping that this blows over so that you won't get taken to court and can cash out without getting thrown into jail. 
But since you are using a swiss entity already, you probably know how to not leave a paper trail and get away with it legally, and launder the money from your theft in an effective way. But apparently your swiss lawyer decided to jump ship, so I guess now the whole mess is on you and Jordi Baylinas head. So maybe the future isn't looking that great for you.
The ETC that is left in that contract is now worth about 30 million USD. It is all going to an multi-sig aimed at "security auditing". This is a prime example how corrupted and greedy some of the people behind and around the Ethereum Foundation are. It really is a joke. They are justifying a mess they created themselves by using badly audited code, and funding it with money they are now literally stealing from the people they scammed into buying into their smart contract in the first place.
