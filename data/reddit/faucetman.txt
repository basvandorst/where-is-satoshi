It's too late to solo mine. Best way if you want to mine would to build a rig and join a mining pool.  Or like a lot of people do is buy mining contracts and purchase mining power for as long as the contract is good for.

Bitcoin loves you too &lt;3
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:07:12
It's a fun game, you might know it if you watch the big bang theory show. Also you don't have to bet your own satoshis because there is a faucet! If you want proof of it being legit then I can show you. Just want to share the best places to get some extra btc.
@_date: 2014-08-31 17:22:33
The buttcoiners volunteer, it's charity work for them.
@_date: 2014-09-13 17:30:45
Why would you want a payment processor to hold your BTC instead of a wallet provider who only concentrates on keeping your BTC safe?
@_date: 2014-09-10 01:43:42
You must be new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-31 02:34:36
Reeds accepts bitcoin. Good luck!

tl:dr TO THE MOON!!!
@_date: 2014-09-15 04:00:23
Quick someone tip me 1 Porsche 911 Turbo so I can buy this!
@_date: 2014-08-24 13:02:18
I think it's up their ally, if they accepted btc I would donate and actually buy the tweaks.
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:36:35
no, idk why that is. This is a professional site, there plans are to profit from deposits then secretly mining. The good thing though is here you don't have to make a deposit with their faucet.
@_date: 2014-09-02 03:11:38
r/Bitcoin does not need this thread.
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:33:54
^^^ It was him. Pay up problem solved
@_date: 2014-08-24 03:22:11
Doge has a pretty low value, lite is going down too, the alt coin with the most support would be blackcoin since they have 60+ devs and lots of plans, if I were you I'd invest $15 into two altcoins. I've heard news about quark too.
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:18:07
NOOOO!!!! All this good news is going to ruin bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:59:59
Doesn't sound too true to me. I'd take that deal though because the face value equals what you are asking. Bitcoin value is low now too so it should rise back over the $500 mark. If you hold them for the long term then they really could be worth more or nothing.
@_date: 2014-08-26 10:56:20
Magic money pimp right there, making it rain paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-07-04 06:30:21
Well here is a place you can get it from a faucet(2k faucet) and play games and win it. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:12:52
I'm sure it wouldn't hurt, I'd hope that would start a trend. There is that one guy with the bitcoin license plate on his lotus.
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:06:27
That wasn't so lame. At least you were and early miner, I just got into it this year. My first purchase with bitcoin was for a mining contract to mine more bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:02:25
I'll take one rum
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:31:29
Serious or reverse psychology?
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:58:47
You've been gone for hours, when is this guy getting back with the stuff we asked him to get?
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:21:40
You forgot; TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2014-09-07 01:59:33
This thread has nothing to do with bitcoin, quick someone delete it!
@_date: 2014-09-06 17:19:57
Now you just have to paint it the bitcoin orange.
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:53:48
Must be a buttcoiner
@_date: 2014-09-20 14:40:27
Thought it was impossible to go into debt with bitcoin, you must be the exception.
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:30:45
Your living the good life.
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:26:26
Forgot to mention the 10k jackpot every 100th bet! It's easy to win once you get your timing down.
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:18:34
What drives me is that is when I work hard I can achieve any goal.
Thanks if you give to this poor soul lol
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:33:38
The project that I hope got the funding was the bitcoin23 car, he raced today idk with the bitcoin logo or not.
Wallet wise I've seen frozenbit who is going to be a multi-currency multi-sig wallet.
Just look around in project development on bitcoin talk forums and you might see some cool legit ones.
@_date: 2014-07-03 07:21:27
I already posted this, I'm sure you connected it to get the .1 which is a shame. Here is the original thread without the ref link. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 02:02:02
One thing is that Dell, and Overstock, and Dish take bitcoin as a payment and I'm sure she has heard of those companies before.
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:46:35
keep going till you get a good streak or till your at 0 then get 2k from the faucet and beat the bot. The faucet is unlimited so as long as your balance is 0, you can get another 2k satoshis.
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:04:25
If you answered yes to any of these questions than you may be a bitcoin enthusiast.
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:39:53
I can't say no to this. I will forward the gift to help advance bitcoin further.
@_date: 2014-09-09 02:37:07
I think that is Satoshi was revealed then it would ruin all the fun.
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:45:36
Thanks, sure will
@_date: 2014-09-09 02:42:33
Plot twist: Satoshi is behind this to throw us off his trail forever
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:36:58
What's collage?
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:25:30
Just stop feeding the troll already.
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:34:51
That's a lot for a scammer of that age.
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:02:42
Now who is buying the first round?
@_date: 2014-09-13 01:55:40
Well how about you just tip us 1 pizza now so we can get personal pizzas. There's always going to be that guy who buys that pizza with the toppings that nobody likes.
@_date: 2014-09-14 02:32:13
I wish I could have been but just don't have the means to buy btc. Sad story
@_date: 2014-08-31 13:21:51
Yes we can set a trap to find the real satoshi. Get a paper wallet trail leading up to the coke then when he grabs the coke the box falls and we got Satoshi!
@_date: 2014-09-14 02:34:52
Maybe one day... Maybe one day &lt;3
@_date: 2014-09-17 02:16:07
 Fired from both Paypal and Samsung
@_date: 2014-08-24 05:35:06
Have to have balls to be in the bitcoin game.
@_date: 2014-09-02 03:50:56
Who needs the moon when there's Canada?!
@_date: 2014-09-15 03:00:03
I've seen it on tv, candid camera I think it's called. Anyways was a clip of a store only accepting bitcoin and the people that came inside were clueless.
@_date: 2014-08-28 11:04:14
Ok you asked for it, I downvoted you. No thanks is necessary.
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:43:14
 Someone probably lost alot of coins with them or something. Webwallets that aren't secured are always getting hacked.
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:20:02
I fall for them every time *sigh*
@_date: 2014-08-24 13:00:41
Bitcoin is to die for
@_date: 2014-09-13 20:41:04
Alright, can you keep me updated?
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:47:59
I think this is a large secret to keep. I don't know how he has kept this to himself, I would have wanted to brag to someone by now.
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:05:16
It was the best of times it was the worst of times.
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:28:01
You could support the Bitcoin23 car.
@_date: 2014-12-12 04:55:56
I was a ps3 user but with my friends on xbox and the x1 being cheaper, I couldn't resist. My favorite thing is how games last played pick up exactly where left off with no loading menu. Plus you have to pay to play multiplayer on both systems. This news is also a plus and will come in handy in the future.
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:25:50
Well Bitcoin is already useful, just the places that will accept them will become more useful.
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:07:07
Just only $20 million?! Let me pull that out of my spare change.
@_date: 2014-09-13 20:10:53
I've been watching this project, so when is the ETA for beta sign up?
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:10:48
I love how bitcoin is the largest image on the options.
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:08:46
I just had pizza for lunch. I could take a pic of that then reimburse me the $5 cost of the pizza. Or I could buy a new one, too much pizza is never a bad problem.
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:38:57
The site is down now because it was never used but can be back up for $5. I'm trying to convince them but I would need to be supported so it wouldn't be in vain.
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:46:30
That's my first goal is to join the 21 million club. I should hit it this year since I had a good start when bitcoin was $270. Congrats and I envy you lol.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:33:16
I know a new crypto forum that would be willing to make the mods of reddit the mods of the crypto forum. Cryptocurrency based and professionally made so you could actually use the website unlike voat. Voat's  issue is its net structure. If there's interest then I will pass the msg on.
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:13:19
Well there may be a plus side to this, they may have brought coins back into the blockchain instead of being out of the total 21 million bitcoins cap.
