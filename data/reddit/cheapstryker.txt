So basically Gox just buys the cheapened coin from their own members until they become solvent? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:41:26
Fuck, I'm so glad they rejected my account/bank account info when I tried to sign up a few months back. Luckily I signed up to coinbase afterwards.
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:51:14
Lol the site is already down
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:36:43
So it's essentially like those "For Tobacco Use Only" signs on bongs and pipes? And what is an extract atomizer?
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:02:42
Someone has to pick up the positivity slack..
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:15:29
Tried for about 3 weeks to get my bank info verified by them. No luck. Got verified in a few days by coinbase with the same info/pictures/documents.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:56:51
What's wrong with regulation of exchanges?
Right now, any of the major exchanges can just decide "fuck it," wait till cyber monday for people to buy large amounts of bitcoin and just close down and run away with the money.
And there will be no repercussions at all
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:14:31
I know, this won't change anything with hardcore bitcoin enthusiasts and such. But I'm talking about public perception, they don't know the ins and outs of the bitcoin protocol and will be scared off (IMO) by stuff like this. 
"My money isn't safe with bitcoin, it can disappear just like it did to those people on Mt.Gox"
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:42:08
But then with the addition of the escrow fee, wouldn't it be the same as Paypal's fees? Or a Credit Card's transaction fee?
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:21:58
I don't get the first part of the title. 
""At today’s panic price of $705 per coin, assuming you were to buy today" Is it just me or does that not make any sense
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:16:53
GUYS GUYS, this is actually good news for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:45:30
It's so rare that it's newsworthy when it happens.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:41:40
Or it'll be used as a counterpoint when arguing against bitcoin in the future
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:42:29
Oh don't get me wrong, I still have a sizable stash of BTC. I just enjoy buying a few dozen extra BTC when it "crashes," like the drop to $600-700 a few weeks ago, and selling it when it spikes back up. 
I suggest adding a  Preying on panic sellers
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:29:18
So can someone summarize what exactly is going on with Mt Gox?
I've searched to try and find a backstory, but all I can find is anti Mt.Gox circlejerking.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:23:26
So are vapes for weed? Or are they like e-cigs?
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:44:48
I don't mind the downvotes.
What's your theory on it?
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:18:14
Buy something for 10BTC. Send BTC, product doesn't come, seller won't answer, what do you do?
Is there a way to overcome this problem? (I'm genuinely curious, not trying to criticize or anything) 
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:08:48
Good luck with that lol.
The community of bitcoin will be it's downfall
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:18:59
At this rate, we'll hit $10,000 by next year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:34:32
It's not panic selling if you bought for 700 and sell for 1000 as I just did.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:49:57
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:35:19
Why are you getting downvoted? You hit the nail on the head. This article is shameless fluff propaganda, and it's embarrassing to see as a bitcoin enthusiast. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:04:11
What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:50:16
Ah ok, thanks for the run down, much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:44:49
because this is a bubble, and it's going to crash to sub $1000
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:03:25
it's a risk man, you can definitely try to time it, sure
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:24:03
But according to what I've read on here, mining gets progressively harder. So the miners are making exponentially less and less as time goes on.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:21:54
I'm curious as to how much programming/time/money is actually needed to actually start an exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:55:42
Awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:33:37
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:05:35
We're a close knit group here. They'll have the option of being paid in USD, bitcoin, or a combination of the two.
Personally, I'd prefer an 80/20 split of USD and bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:05:31
My bank bent me over a few times to service me. A real helpful bunch.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:02:02
So coinbase and all these sites have invested 10+ million dollars into their websites?
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:37:09
But on kickstarter, you get your money back if the project fails to meet its goal. You can't reverse BTC transactions, so what's stopping people from creating a "hollow" project to get few $100 worth of bitcoin and bounce?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:58:18
Oh wow 10k a week? Thought it was wayyyy lower 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:33:18
They're acting big and threatening right away because they have nothing on you. You can keep the BTC and they can't do anything, and they know it.
It's up to you if you wanna be a good Samaritan 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:41:55
I have to disagree with this. Not only can you purchase things with bitcoin, you can also instantaneously convert it to fiat via bitpay/coinbase or other services if you wish. Calling it a "monumental effort" is a gross exaggeration IMO
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:54:32
Sorry again if I'm being ignorant here, but wouldn't it be the opposite? 
"This is why you never sell bitcoin to a buyer with a credit card"
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:05:05


It's not, you're just giving them a 3% fee instead of buying a gift card with BTC for free (free as in no fee)
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:13:48
Who is paying you to defend?
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:17:19
Don't fall for his BS. Look at his posting history.
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:01:48
Yeah, that's a good suggestion, I'll add that from now on
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:57:23
And another (possibly ignorant) question, wouldn't raising the market cap be essentially the same as the government raising the debt ceiling? It'll devalue BTC won't it?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:48:36
Why wouldn't they just transfer the BTC to the kid's wallet? I'm not trying to be cold, I'm just curious as to what benefit your service provides. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:32:39
Hookers have surprisingly good business etiquette, or so I've heard...from a friend of a friend...
And yeah that's exactly what I was thinking, once I scan the QR, he can just call the police/scream for help/tell people I'm trying to rob him/etc and I'd have no proof at all otherwise 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:44:41
You can guess, not predict
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:51:45
Honestly I think that depends on the payroll company that we'll use. 
But if I have the choice, I'll pick one day per month, buy my BTC and lock in the exchange price of my purchase. They'll get paid via the locked in exchange rate of my purchased BTC.
Hope that answers your question 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:43:16
Capital gains tax
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:57:18
Ah thanks for the clarification. I didn't know they were specially designed, just assumed it was a different brand. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:24:52
Thanks man, I appreciate the comprehensive post. 
As for the first question, I figured there would be some sort of payroll system where I can input $20,000 or so, and have my employees paid $16,000 USD and $4000 worth of BTC from the payroll's inventory of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:03:47
He sure showed them. How dumb are those people?? Not buying gold from a stranger on the street! HA!
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:31:23
The user will have a bank account tied to his/her account. You'll deposit cash from your bank account to the website, and from there you can purchase BTC from other users.
Example: I deposit $1000 from my bank account into the website. I see that "supercoolbtcseller" is selling 1.1 BTC for $450 and I buy it. He receives cash via the website into his bank account, and I'll receive his BTC via my wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:31:37
That's kind of my point. It seems more like a wildly fluctuating stock rather than a convenient stable currency. In it's current state, it cannot be used as a form of payment to enployees
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:25:46
Don't forget, coinbase doesn't make bitcoins. They buy it just like everyone else. Except they buy millions of dollars worth at a time, and then sell to us.
On the plus side, the price you paid is locked in. If the price jumps up to $1500 on the second of next month, you'll still pay $800 or whatever you paid a few days ago.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:14:37
Not quite what I mean, with localbitcoins you need to set up an individual bank deposit IN PERSON to someone's account, meet in person to exchange funds, or use moneygram, all of which can be risky.
I'm talking about having your bank account and an online wallet hooked up to a website, like coinbase, and directly buy and sell coins between users 
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:46:56
I'd guess Google personally
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:45:23
Go ahead and type your question into google

Scam, don't fall for it
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:05:18
Ah my mistake, I confused it with the number of BTC in circulation 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:12:08
But it's not groundbreaking development. Wouldn't someone be able to hire a team of developers for around $500k for 6 months to get it done? 
I'm not saying code development is free, I just think $20 million for an exchange website is a bit too much
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:19:02
Definitely agree as well. The volatility of BTC is its main enemy  right now, in my opinion. For it to succeed, both as a means of payment and as a currency, the price needs to stabilize, and we have no real idea when that could happen.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:13:51
Can't we just build it ourselves? Do they have a special type of GPU/CPU that isn't accessible to the rest of us?
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:12:00
Thanks for the responses guys
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:05:20
Awesome, thanks for the help!
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:56:21
Is it physically possible for the market cap to be raised? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:19:08
Can't you chargeback with paypal?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:45:40
Ah thank you, Mt.Gox was essentially what I was looking for.
And I suppose you're right about the p2p
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:50:19
It felt like a meth deal haha. I expected to shoot the shit, make some small talk about bitcoin's newfound popularity and whatnot, since he would've been my first ever BTC sale. And then get the transaction done afterwards. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:06:41
I'm pretty sure he was expecting me to send the BTC and then make a run for it. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:00:06
I've been selling/buying on craigslist all throughout college so it wasn't THAT out of the ordinary. But yeah, the refusal of a phone number should have been a red flag
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:03:13
Why do people mine BTC if the return is so low?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:52:52
Vapes are e-cigarettes for those wondering 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:11:10
Ah I see. Neat idea, I've read that the human mind is more inclined to help when they see a physical goal/reward/outcome, so having a concrete number might help.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:13:09
I doubt it'll crash (fall below $500) due to the extremely high demand. Plus the huge demand that will be created once the news of the Senate hearing starts to spread.
But hey, nobody knows for sure

Oh I was chilling. I told him calmly: "Hey man I'm gonna need you to take out and count the money for me real quick before we go any further"
He didn't show me a single bill, left literally like 30 seconds after I said that
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:07:11
Just curious, but how do people panic sell at $900? 
Even if I wanted to sell my BTC at 900, coinbase doesn't use Mt.Gox, so they never even went past $800 per BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:43:27
I searched for it on here and can't find it, maybe I'm using the wrong search parameters/keywords.
Google search brings up coinbase's employees getting paid in BTC, but not much else. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:13:44
Do you think there's an opportunity to create some sort of a USD &lt;&gt; BTC trader?
I've been trying literally all morning to buy and sell a few of my BTCs, and it's been a huge headache 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:41:58
They don't get paid to work. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:33:33
Still, you'd have to make a manual deposit to your bank in order to fulfill any orders on bitquick
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:46:52
But still, with international wire transfers, bank transfers, moneygram, etc...what's stopping the other party from taking your money and never sending anything to your wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:44:50
Try  Back in the day you could buy/sell money in Second Life and use it to buy BTC
