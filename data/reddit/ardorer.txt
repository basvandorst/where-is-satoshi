Ardor is doing this (DC &amp; DS combo) right now too. With a main-chain and child-chains anchored to it.

Ardor has a parent-chain or main-chain, much like the Bitcoin blockchain. It is designed to be lean and function as a blockchain that is strong on Decentralization and Consensus (as per the above paper). Then the Ardor platform has a concept of side-chains, called child-chains, that inherit the trust and security from the parent-chain. But importantly, the child-chain transaction data does not need to be embedded in the parent-chain (the Scale comes from this eco-system of side-chains). This keeps the blockchain size of the parent-chain low.
Because it was designed that way from the beginning, Ardor won't have a large legacy blockchain to carry forward.

Yes. And you can also look at the  Are you aware that Ethereum is planning to move to a Proof-Of-Stake consensus mechanism? This is not a recent development either, it has always been in their roadmap.
Also, NXT is a platform supporting much more than it's own token's market cap in value.

NXT uses a 100% Proof-Of-Stake consensus mechanism. And another for good measure - Peercoin uses a hybrid Proof-Of-Work/Proof-Of-Stake consensus mechanism.

Is CoinBase itself not an option in your European country? The are available in that part of the world. Circle.com used to be a great option, not any more I don't think.

That's an excellent analogy because Veganism may become more wide-spread out of necessity just like Bitcoin. Animal agriculture isn't ecologically sustainable and neither is the traditional financial system.

I think Andreas is great but I'm also a little bit perplexed by his stance here. As you said Proof-Of-Stake evidently works for a number of blockchains so far. I guess he's claiming that there is extra additional security piled on top of the blockchain with Proof-Of-Work and I think I see why he is making this point but I don't agree. He probably wants more evidence that Proof-Of-Stake is comparatively secure. And he has said previously that he wants to see more value secured by Proof-Of-Stake blockchains.
Proof-Of-Stake exposes Proof-Of-Work as being wasteful.

Proof-Of-Stake works, theoretically and practically. You have no reason to believe that it will not work for Ethereum. And Bitcoin used to have transaction numbers just like that too.
Anyway, evidently there are numerous ways to solve the Byzantine General's Problem. Not all of them waste inordinate amounts of energy. So, no, waste is not "the cost to solve it". I hope this helped OP!

Hmmm, Bitcoin also doesn't work at scale (depending on what you compare it to). People are working on that though, thankfully.
It's great that you demand more evidence. This is all very experimental after-all. OP (and others) are just concerned about the increasing energy demands of Bitcoin mining on a finite planet. I offered him some alternatives. You offered him no alternative and tried to discredit his environmental concern.

"Intellectually honest" eh? What about Proof-of-Stake (POS)? It is securing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies as we speak.
