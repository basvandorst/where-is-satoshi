Except people aren't emailing them. We should get a list of circle, coinbase, etc employee reddit acxounts (that they used during amas and emails and have it neatly placed here so people do it. Or make a thread for this like gamergate peeps did to email advertising companies over at They actually got things done this way. 
We could do the same for circle and coinbase to have the pins password screen to change where the numbers are placed in their app. And to include bip70 encryption

You should post what the two sides bullet points should be 
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:39:33
i dont get how your being downvoted. i swear the subreddit is filled with shills
@_date: 2014-10-26 17:51:29
Bitcoin future is centralized though. Soon only those bankers will have the money to afford the rigs to be mining... 
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:50:15
This was an Amazing read. i have thought of this so many times but could never write down so perfectly. Have some bits 1000 bits @_date: 2014-09-30 01:06:02
you can have btc and pay your bills. like this! 100 bits @_date: 2014-10-09 15:59:50
Circle. You can instantly go from btc into your debit card and then atm for cash
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:32:35
If only i2p would work. I've had it running for 24 hours and still can't access any site...
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:22:31
Do any of these have any uses that work now?
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:18:30
@_date: 2014-09-30 00:56:44
I bought $25 of btc with no experience of buying btc and it took about 5 minutes to set up and the purchase was instant. (used a debit card and was only charged 73 cents)
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:47:11
**$80** replacement fee WTF! why wouldnt i just get a new one? 
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:32:23
oh, alright. Is there any fix to the fact that bitcoin will become centralized when it becomes extremely expensive to mine? 
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:18:47
yes but put in a super simple way and lazy way.  so it can become accessible to the far reaches of the reddit community.
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:54:59
This is awesome. Hell yeah. I'm going to try this out.
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:10:50
emailing them will help though. It would also introduce a lot new people to Bitcoin if Amazon accepts Bitcoin and has a banner on their page saying "We now Accept Bitcoin!". 
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:51:20
these meshnets could connect with this  on phones instead of bluetooth!
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:45:13
Go to changetip.com they have explain everything. Idk about a whole bitcoin because that's too much money for me to be gifting xD
@_date: 2014-09-13 17:30:36
how is bitcoin going to STAY decentralized though? there's going to be a time where only the rich can afford to mine. what do we do then? 
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:54:29
It always says "server not found"
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:45:48
Why don't we have a name for a number of bitcoin that's 1 USD dollar. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:19:11
This is actually smart. If we have camgirls and fetish sites using bitcoin then we can have people wanting to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:33:59
Doot doot
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:35:50
Yeah, pretty much ChangeTip but as an open source extension so any crypto currency can use it and so you can link it to be activate whenever you upvote something. you could add a monthly amount if you want 1$ is 100 upvotes which i wouldnt even use in a month. like Flattr but with cryptocurrencies. someone pitch this to Peter Sunde...the mega downvote= pay a price seems too risky to be abused my trolls. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:32:04
you have to give the last 4 digits of your SSN. wouldnt this prevent them from doing so? 
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:48:32
I didn't know that. And it looks like noone does since there rarely any comments on the threads 
@_date: 2014-09-10 16:48:24
How long does it take for a Bitcoin transaction to verify? I don't wanna wait in line 10 minutes waiting for my money to arrive.
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:39:08
Why not send btc with changetip instead? 
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:52:28
My understanding is that miners are solving a complex algorithm to make a bitcoin. What algorithm is it solving? And would it be possible for miners to be decrypting something with there combined hashing power?
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:35:49
Damn guy do you have to many bits or something?
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:29:26
Are literally all parts of bitcoin open source? Is there anything thing like the encryption it uses closed source?
@_date: 2014-09-30 00:50:19
cool, thanks! i feel like bitcoin is a whole new thing because of this. its no longer magic internet money, its now feels like its something i can actually easily get and use.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:03:27
you can buy btc with your debit card on circle....
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:19:04
I don't understand how petiole trust TOR. Doesn't the exit node get unencrypted data? So the exit node can record what your doing? We already know tons of exit node are government owned since they built and fund the project. Isn't this a huge flaw?
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:21:44
what happens if the hardware damages or lost?
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:22:21
It does
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:27:17
tipping people can be a way to advertise any crypto currency. seems like reddit integration would be a perfect fit.  If Reddcoin doesnt step up and make it the official coin that is. I still don't understand how bitcoin is still about who can afford the fastest miners. Why would i want only the richest people mining when everyone can just contribute like a Torrent Swarm.
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:22:48
What information do exit nodes see from a user? I'd an exit node is compromised isn't the user de anonymized?
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:10:38
It doesn't matter if people aren't interested in how it works. bitcoin will become popular when it becomes simpler and better to use than a credit card without having to learn anything about it. Most people don't care how a car works, but use it because does what they want it to do very well.
The real problem with bitcoin is the fact that it will become more and more centralized as time goes by where only the richest people who can afford crazy miners will be able to keep it afloat.&lt;-this is the reason I don't invest and am waiting for a better "mining" process.
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:19:05
How are they wrong? It's simple math
@_date: 2014-12-21 15:37:05
Can someone explain this to a pleb?
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:02:02
ok this is fucking amazing. just bought $25 of btc in like a minute. holy hell. it only cost 73 cents. the only problem though is my balance keeps fluctuating a penny. it goes up and down from $25 to $24.99 for some reason =\
EDIT: its gone down to $24.83 is this because the bitcoin price is moving? cuz damn that updates quick
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:00:05
I just checked my settings and Firefox didn't have the proxy settings set up right. Now I just get "eepsite unreachable"

Can you contact him to make this happen?
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:39:36
What im saying is tipping along with upvotes will appeal to people far outside the bitcoin subreddit. I'm sure a Brony who knows nothing about any crypto currency could get interested if RES or reddit came with this feature to simply set up so you can receive money for posting witty,funny,intelligent,provacative things. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:21:08
If they are running the exit node you're using what information can they get?

i think its kinda weird someone gilded you instead of send you btc. 100 bits @_date: 2014-08-04 18:13:32
How will bitcoin stay decentralized if mining to keep bitcoin decentralized becomes more and more expensive as times goes by? in a couple years wont it be only feasible for very rich companies to be mining?
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:46:58
And [Bitcloud]( for sharing informaiton? Holy shit!
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:25:48
I agree with this. I really hope they take the advice life openbazaar and change the name to something nicer. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:14:02
well how about we do do it and show redditors what's possible so it can be adopted
@_date: 2014-11-16 09:34:41
Are any of these usable now?
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:20:42
How the hell do you know all this? Do you work at his bank or something?
@_date: 2014-10-01 22:13:34
I gave you like a couple cents maybe. So don't get too excited XD but you should have gotten a message on how to collect the btc
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:34:25
This should be included in tails! Anonymous calls sounds awesome
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:48:06
This is a ridiculous statement. Any government has the funds to buy the the computers to hold more than 52% of the hah rate and destroy and crypto currency that poses a threat.... 
@_date: 2014-09-01 17:43:29
Why does active think mining is a good idea? Seems like its a the rich and richer scheme. As the years go by bitcoin just becomes more and more centralized, seems like itll just banking 2.0. I read somewhere something about proof of importance instead of proof of work, why doesn't bitcoin use that to stay decentralized?

I've verb trying to get into i2p but after running it for 24 hours I still can't access a site. Is there something I can do to fix it? I feel like it really shouldn't take more than a couple minutes if its ever going to get widespread adoption
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:40:15
How else will average Joe get btc though. We need a decentralized way of getting btc without jumping through hoops
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:47:28
Ohhh cool. Great work with privacytools.io! I've recommended it to a bunch of people. 
You should check out morph.is a new p2pnet

You should use disconnect instead of ghostery. Ghostery sells data to advertising companies
