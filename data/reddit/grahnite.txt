Awesome! +1 for this hypothesis. Love it! :)
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:48:27
I like Pi. Been mining away happily. Who knows, maybe it will be a thing some day.
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:17:05
Lekker man :)
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:14:18
I think you just proved it yourself......
@_date: 2019-03-31 09:19:33
I'm still working on it, but if you are arty, you  can sell your work at 
Different crypto coins accepted. Artists get paid in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 21:46:49
I like. 
What software did you use to make it?
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:16:23
O boy, this will not go down well AT ALL. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:14:56
The most practical suggestion so far. I can see this working. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 19:51:16
Minexpay.com hopefully soon again. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 09:20:58
Mine alt-coins. Sell them for BTC. 
Look at Whattomine.com to see what you can mine with what required hashing power. 
@_date: 2019-11-07 19:57:12
If you can find out who the real owner is, I would contact him and inform him. Hopefully he can at least give you a finders fee. 
If there is no way to ID the real owner, I would think it should be yours.
@_date: 2019-11-10 07:19:36
Just puked a bit in my mouth
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:56:20
Still buying now and again. Getting some money in this week that was unplanned. A chunk will be used for buying more BTC. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:23:24
Fund your Bitpay (yes, I know...) wallet with BTC and then buy Amazon gift vouchers in the wallet. Fund your Amazon account with the voucher and Bob's your uncle :)
@_date: 2018-10-26 07:21:27
The minexpay cards will offer the same. They should hopefully be available pretty soon. The more options, the better. All these cards help Bitcoin towards mass adoption :)
@_date: 2019-11-18 19:23:50
Where did this crap of calling people “boomers” as an insult come from? I am a Gen-X and it offends me that older people are being called morons basically. Really wish this stupid trend dies a quick death. It is rude and un-called for.
@_date: 2018-10-09 08:37:49
Hi Pip! Awesome puzzle :)
Some questions, if you are willing to answer:
1. To find the private key for the 310 BTC address, is it compulsory to first find the keys to the 3 smaller addresses? Do we need the info for each preceding account, and use that known data, to crack the next? Or is it possible to crack the 310 key without cracking the smaller 3 first?
2. Are we looking for a 12 word seed in order to access the 310 BTC, or a key? I ask this, since the 0.1 address was solved via the seed words.
3. Are you Satoshi Nakamoto? :)
Thx :)
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:26:21
Quiet before the storm :)
@_date: 2018-10-29 14:21:12
I'll be dead then, so who cares?
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:15:59
Minexpay.com will be shipping cards soon as well. Will be accepted worldwide. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 07:19:38
I come here for news, fun and meme's. If you want your own reddit group where all the fun has been sucked out and everything is just serious banker talk, please go make your own. Love this group as it is. Free speach and all that :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:27:42
Let it dump. I have some cash on hand to buy the dip :)
@_date: 2018-06-20 10:20:55
Well done! :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:48:03
You need more crypto-friends :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:29:10
My cash is ready for the bottom
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:22:19
Have we reached the bottom yet?
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:06:18
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:25:10
Indeed. I buy Amazon.co.uk vouchers at eGifter and buy stuff on Amazon. Easy. No conversion to fiat required. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 06:40:06
Minexpay.com 
Their first batch of cards have been released. Second batch end of the month. System still have a few rough edges they are working out. Their card works world wide. 
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:08:14
Wait. Was Asuka the prophet or the time traveller?
@_date: 2019-02-25 06:39:43
Now is a pretty good time to get in I would say. Be willing to wait another 2-3 years for a new ATH though. Just be patient and invest small amounts regularly. Never make debt to invest!!!! Only invest what you are prepared to lose. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 08:25:00
The Internet was not replacing money. Replacing money will take longer, but will have a massive impact on every single person's life. There are still some people not using the Internet, believe it or not. These people will HAVE to start using Bitcoin once it becomes the new world reserve currency :)
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:15:16
Please don't spoil a good Bitcoin discussion by bringing up that useless turd called Btrash. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:43:38
Yes, shitcoin website. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:20:37
Yes. You buy the card with MNX tokens. You don't need to purchase them at an exchange. You can buy them on their website via InstaBuy. You FUND the card with either MNX or BTC. Just putting it out there. And the system is not 100% mature yet, some way to go still. But guys have already received their cards and they work. But DYOR and only do something of you are comfortable with the risk. 
And they are not just about a crypto card. They have an AR game coming out next month and you can also Park your MNX coins for interest at Minexbank.com 
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:46:15
Not at Bitstamp
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:59:49
Well put together. I like :)
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:06:19
For now stick with Bitcoin. 
My personal moonshot that I also hold though, is CHI coins of the Xaya.io project. A blockchain gaming platform doing amazing things. Low total coin supply of only 77m and pretty cheap, one can pick up a bunch.
@_date: 2019-02-23 15:31:28
Seconded! 
@_date: 2019-02-20 16:25:00
Bitcoin Crash is Trash! :)
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:16:42
A Bull run will start the moment I sell my crypto. But I'm not selling. So there will never be a bull run ever again. Lol. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 15:29:22
No mention of the Minexpay card. Mastercard that works world wide. Still effectively in Beta-like stage, but the first batch of cards were issued and work. The back end systems and processes still being refined though, so still some rough edges. Will be a very strong contender once all the teething issues are sorted. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:23:23
Shitcoin will go to shit :)
The other Bcash must also crash like the trash it is!!!
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:44:30
Dont joke, my alts are bleeding badly. Hoping for an alt bull run once Bitcoin hopefully stabilises at some price point. :(
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:17:18
YES. Just to throw things off again :)
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:38:31
Yes! So glad someone else mentioned this. Broken for me since yesterday. 
Any good alternatives?
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:10:21
Exactly. And they punt their own scam coin.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:55:21
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:09:15
BCH is the scum of the earth.
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:06:42
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:56:20
BCH all versions die in the war, everybody goes back to BTC, kicking off the next major bull run. Souds good to me :)
@_date: 2018-11-02 06:59:38
Totally misleading headline and article. That is not what Van Eck said. It is what another party said and I ly their opinion. I would avoid that website for any crypto news in future.....
@_date: 2018-11-07 07:01:29
Things looking a bit more bullish today.....
@_date: 2019-01-11 06:32:18
Now his partner in crime must also go down: Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:19:45
Why do people always sell when the price hit the bottom(or close to it)? I just don't understand the logic. Mind boggles. I guess the same people that buy at the ATH?
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:15:03
@_date: 2019-01-30 12:31:35
Use Beam
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:13:00
Awesome! Looking foward to using this on IOS :)
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:07:06
Indeed. Would be a great start to 2019 of all flavours of Btrash can die at its start. Useless, unnecessary distractions from the real thing: Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:11:23
They are both crap and their death cannot come soon enough. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:06:37
Yep, bought some with fiat today. Keeping some aside in case it falls further, but happy that this is a pretty good entry for now.
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:03:11
They are scum
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:38:55
You obviously invested more than what you were prepared to lose.......
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:39:31
Good riddance indeed. The sooner all forms of Btrash dies, the better for the whole crypto community. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:08:26
Let's hope :)
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:16:02
Can Bcash just crash and die already. I have completely stopped visiting bitcoin.com out of protest. Will not support those BCH scumbags. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:50:26
Well said.  Seconded. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:29:33
Deliberate misrepresentation has nothing to do with trademark law. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:29:14
You obviously missed the part where he ON PURPOSE try and confuse new users. That I'd called FRAUD. I don't give a dang what he thinks. Deliberate misrepresentation is FRAUD. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:08:18
Cheers! Won't miss you, and thanks for the cheap BTC. Lol!
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:03:52
Hey! What do you have against bald people! :)
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:47:57
If you can't see the blatant dishonesty, then you really are blind. It is affecting ALL crypto investments, since it puts the whole crypto space in a bad light. It is scammy and dishonest and just unacceptable. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:04:58
Ver should be dragged in front of a judge to face charges of fraud. What a scumbag. Btrash cannot die soon enough. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:01:05
This is awesome! Thanks for sharing, much appreciated!!!
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:01:53
Agreed. Bcash = Crap
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:04:33
Use BEAM. MimbleWimble protocol coin that can be used completely anonymously. Monero can be tracked under some circumstances. BEAM is completely anonymous.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:33:31
I bought my first at around $412
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:48:48
Check out minexbank.com - credit cards being rleased soon that you can fund with fiat, BTC, ETH and MNX tokens. 
@_date: 2019-05-21 09:36:19
Bitcoin don't need a ETF.
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:39:05
Makes sense then, as expected. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:47:50
Couldn't be bothered about your problem when you have a foul mouth like that, sorry. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:23:22
Binance and KuCoin allow Visa purchases of Bitcoin, have you tried them?
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:03:39
Lol. I am a long term bull. Buying as much BTC as I safely can. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:52:18
ONE MILLION DOLLARS! :)
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:11:04
Yes, please sell me all your cheap Bitcoin. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:50:53
Awesome, thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:18:43
Well done! Stay away from that snake!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:52:23
Found the foul-mouthed, self righteous American
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:28:46
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:37:14
Ah. That explains everything then. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:17:03
I would recommend reading the Bitcoin whitepaper. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:59:25
No stock or crypto price just goes up. After the last strong uptrend, it is just normal to have a pull-back. Probably a slow down-trend for the next week or two before consolidating and crawling higher again, would be my prediction.
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:32:23
My poor alts are bleeding! Lol.
@_date: 2019-05-19 05:56:04
That's why would never touch Bcash with a 10 foot barge pole. It's a turd waiting to bankrupt its hodlers.
