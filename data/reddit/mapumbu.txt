HODL is not a mis-spelling of anything; it's an acronym for Hold On (for) Dear Life. So what does REKT stand for?

It's the direction it is heading that explains the difference. It's like a glass half empty or half full. It's half full if it has been added to and half empty if it has be drunk from. Our bitcoin funds have been consumed!

I can cause the markets to rise in an instant. All I have to do is sell.
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:55:58
It goes up all the time right? As the calculations get harder and harder. Is there a graph that shows that increase?
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:54:21
Thank you

Big mistake letting me know: I'll buy them for 2 pence
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:34:01
I hope it falls to ZERO. Then i buy them ALL!

Wait. I remember this guy getting in at $9,800. That was before the crash. Finally he's seeing profit!

Thank you. Please explain

Thank you. That's what I'm going to do

Except it hasn't really been a pleasure has it?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:59:48
The real trick is not to ever buy in totally or sell out totally. Buy the current dip with 35% of your fund. If it goes down another 10%, buy again with another 35%, if it goes up 20%, sell 30% of your funds.
So unless it all goes completely tits up, you can get to a situation where you don't care if it goes up or down.

If only there was a way of recording on the open ledger who owned videos and what their source was. Oh yeah, there is. It's called the YOYOW ("You Own Your Own Work") cryptocoin.

I stopped as well. Deleted the app. Suddenly the freedom that had eluded me since last year came flodding back. I'll look at the prices once a month, and check out the memes on reddit if i have an itch!

Oh it's up is it? I stopped looking in February. I've become a NOTL (Not Looking)

I've been HODLing for 6 months now. Buying the dips but never selling the rises. Always been too greedy. So now I am going to see 20% of my coins. This way if they go up, that's ok - I still have 90% of my coins - but if there another bloodbath, I don't go into 3 days of depression, kicking myself that I didn't see this coming. That's my plan and I'm sticking to it

And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:12:31
Sell at 9,700! Let's learn from our mistakes before. Lets not get greedy. At least all half your coins are 9700. 10k will.see a huge plummet back to 5800. And all that depression. Remember that depression?
