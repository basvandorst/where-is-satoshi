Looking BTC on 5 min chart is kinda useless.

Are node hard on hardware ? I have a server with 32threads idling most of the time at home. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:17:47
Link to the moved BTC ?
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:00:31
ok  
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:51:43
BTC at 50k for 1T total market cap is poor BTCD... That's not that good.
BTC alone at 50k is 950B market only for BTC. This leave only 5% market for alts. The guy who predict this is dumb AF.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:31:00
Just hold and wait untill BTC is worth enough for even the richer to not be able to move the market.
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:08:02
Nothing. It just is'nt right.

Thanks !
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:12:48
Loll. I'm that guy too :D Without even knowing i sold at pretty much ATH. Feels good. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:06:45
You need to go back to school. I just calculated exatly and it 560.55$ in fees.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:58:32
500$ fees. BTC not that good on fees :(

I was about to ask. Whoever made this image dont know shit about crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:41:17
Is this article made from a translator ?
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:25:19
Strong, we are.
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:22:54
Thats Nice news.
@_date: 2019-09-15 23:33:34
Sry but lolll
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:23:35
In fact it was about 5-6 min.
EDIT : Sorry, was \~10. Just rechecked it.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:28:18
1 Lambo  
2 Ferrari  
3 Porsche  
4 McLaren   
5 Toyota for the days you feel like a nobody.
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:24:49
99% of betting site are shady AF. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:48:01
I'm sorry.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:43:39
The next question is how long will it take to reach \~13k$
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:02:43
Not even worth my time to try to find it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:59:21
And as you can see 7k it was. Topped 7.5K, back under 7k and played with 7k then shoot straight to 8k.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:33:12
Anything bellow 7K is a buy zone right now. Then hold at least untill \~13k.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:07:38
BTC is affordable.   
You can have 0.00000178 BTC for as low as 1 US cents.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:14:51
Do it, NOW ! thank me later.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:09:53
It's mostl likely the betting site themself that scammed him.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:22:44
Most of top alts are safe investment right now. Some just bottomed like TRX and XRP. 
Invest and profit !
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:00:36
Have fun looking at his money going away.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:01:00
That bad english typing
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:59:34
I watch on trading view and from multiple sources. If I see 400% it have to be on all of them to trust it.
@_date: 2019-05-29 20:24:05
Craig is a joke. BSV wont overtake BTC.

A single huge short position was liquidated Las night.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:52:07
I bet that you only look the 5 min chart on \~12hrs.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:05:20
BTC is not a virus.
BTW caps title are for sissy.
