Thanks for the link, I was kind of confused until I followed back to that post's OP.
This is a list of things that you think would shock people if sent back one year into the past.

I think that the Chinese thing is actually a mixed bag, good because they are able to generate value using electricity bought in yuan in a free unpegged currency, and bad because there is such a concentration in processing power currently in one part of the world.

Thanks! That means a lot to me.
I'll put it to good use.

Sometimes there are issues in confirmation, and incorrect values can reside in old copies of the blockchain.

Reminds me of a text based game

I'm trying to raise funds for the millionaire makers sub as well, this is a great time to give btc since it's undervalued.

My attorney's bra has no impact on her professional competence or understanding of bitcoin.

you could just buy 3x as many coins on the market, why wouldn't you?
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:52:44
How much of a bankroll do you need for this to be worthwhile?

Not to detract from the technology or the discussion, but I think that the term "merkle-sum" sounds quite funny

I am planning on emptying my wallet for the winner.
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:37:50
Blockchain.info shows that you still have 472 BTC on that wallet, so it's just a matter of lost data.

I honestly forgot that it was this year

I'd buy an ATM

Used to be a free dollar.

De ja vu all over again, you know?
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:39:57
I kind of want to hear more about that script.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:28:12
Do you need to put any information into the machine to buy BTC, like biometrics or name/address?
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:29:02
You could try trading Paypal for Bitcoin, but you'd have to find someone willing to do that, and an anonymous way to fund a PayPal account.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:35:25
I kind of agree with a lot of what was said.
My experience with BTC and crypto in general has been a mixed bag, Redditors/Net people seem to love it, but the vast majority of folks couldn't care less and don't use it.
I don't blame them, but it's harder to get and spend btc, especially in an anonymous fashion, than it is to get Paypal credit.
At least for me.

It's better than nothing.

That's pretty dang real.
I'd better cop some BTC
