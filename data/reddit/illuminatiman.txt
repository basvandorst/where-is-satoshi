Yes taxes exist outside of the currency we're using. But you see the people who make the currency also steal over half of it back and give it in the form of "free" loans to the ultra rich. It's a cycle of perpetual slavery, can't even consider it taxes anymore as barely any of it goes back into the real non speculative goods/services economy. 
Central banks and tax authorities are reverse robin-hoods who can access your bank account the press of a button and take everything you have if you disagree with them.  
However they can't do that with my coins, hence bitcoin is superior for theft evasion.
Edit: Personally i don't want mainstream support. I want bitcoin to annihilate the mainstream incumbents that are asleep at the wheel.

We are using electricity as a means to ensure that the block validation proccess is somewhat random and competitive as no one yet has access to abundant energy. This secures the network, thus there are only incentives to INCREASE the hashrate. Security is the MAIN pillar of the bitcoin network. So the purpose is to enable transactions on bitcoin.
Bitcoin miners also trend toward using renewable resources as it's a much better idea to "trade" something renewable (hydro energy) for something scarce (bitcoin). So if anything, provided that bitcoin continues it's current trajectory of adoption, it will become the main driver of innovation in renewable energy sources.

The value of any "safe and immutable" asset that has a limited HARD supply will always trend towards infinity if it's measured against an asset (fiat) which is permanently inflationary. This is because the value of fiat money approaches 0 as it's always being diluted. US debt doubles around every 7 - 10 years. We'll be at M4 quadrillions in no time.. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:17:58

@_date: 2017-02-12 22:16:37
I've been thinking about this for a good while. Also think about that a miner/group of miners can spike their hashrates before difficulty adjustment and then spike down right after adjustment, increasing block times(higher tx backlog). Then proceed to spam transactions with fess that they will mine themselves in order to bloat mempool and increase fees for everybody else. By looking at avg total fees earned by miners per day vs decrease in avg amount in blocks after diff adjustments it seems that this wouldn't be profitable for the network as a whole however it might(need more investigation/data) be more profitable for some single actors, we simply don't know. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:59:10
lol they want to waste money, smart guys
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:53:01
It's easy. People are paying more in transaction fees. 
Or if you want some tinfoil i'd say china miners are making a cartel and spamming blocks with transactions/high fees, which they end up being the block finders of anyway. Thus they force the fees to go up for everyone else too and rake in dat extra $$$$!

Gotta correct you there slightly if you don't mind. It's only the "purchasing and sales" of bitcoin for cash and goods and services denominated in cash that are regulated. The protocol itself and any transactions within the crypto eco - system remain unregulated.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:17:50
why? btc works fine without an etf 
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:29:31
Imo, if people want a PoW change they should just implement a form of multi algo like myriadcoon or dgb. Sha 256 will stay on the chain together with whatever other algos are chosen and everybody is happy. :D
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:53:30
Yes, yes, yes this please. Multi-algo is the future :) I would love to see btc implement this however there is still a risk that ASICS can be developed for any algo provided it will be worthwhile for the manufacturer. Would need something like an infinite amount of algos for gpus and cpus that the network can generate to keep those pesky china asics away, spetsnaz style :D 
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:07:14
No its 5 algos that run in parralel independant of each other with their own difficulty adjustments. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:13:22


Right, they "might" have access to an endless amount of AMD 280Xs however i doubt that, and if they do have access or they invest vast amounts of money into those then some sweet miner will make an ASIC for that specific algorithm and then the government will also have to make ASICS, the users will then change PoW once again and everyone will be back to square one. The only people wasting money will be the miners attempting to gain control of the network, as they're working against the incentives baked into the code. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:16:51
It doesn't "multiply" the attack space but rather "divides" it. 51% Of hashing power of 1 algorithm is only around 10% of the networks hashing power.

Wheeeey great, let them buy all the hashing power in the world. Then bitcoin will just change PoW or another alt will take the lead and they can use their useless metal as campfires. Rinse repeat til they're broke.

@_date: 2017-03-24 21:55:52
No that's wrong. Preventing ASICS is a good goal. ASICS are single purpose hardware. This prevents a good distribution of hardware for everyone to mine if they wish. A good goal is having an algorithm that works only on general purpose hardware such as a GPU or CPU so you maximize the amount of actual miners contributing to the network instead of maximizing the amount of hashrate (which is relative) with a low amount of miners. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:59:43
Your hostile attitude suggests that you have no clue and would rather resort to name calling like a little 5 year old. ASICS are bad, i don't want them. The debate didn't happen a long time ago, it's still ongoing. You're wasting the air that we breathe.

It's not a solution it's a means of defense, which will work. Use your own fucking brain. Botnets won't control the network, neither will rogue sys admins because they will get pushed out by ASICS and once those that own those ASICS decide that they want a monopoly on hashing power the network can PoW change and the cycle will repeat. I.e there is no profit in attempting to achieve a monopoly of hashing power, only a loss incurred by losing your hardware. 
Just because you are unable to comprehend, doesn't mean that i should delete my post.

No new markets + no new buyers = no sales = stock down

EDIT: you don't understand the math. The 2-3% a year is billions of dollars/yen/rubles/euros a year, increasing at an exponential rate, actually there is so much that around every 10 years more fiat will be created than all years before. The amount fiat being farted into existence is much more than the amount of bitcoin that is going to be ever created (21million). Each year there is enough fiat being created to raise the price of bitcoin exponentially.

Ah yes i completely i agree with you. What i really meant, to clarify more, is that on the way up to the theoretical 100k a coin is where the distribution of bitcoin would be most prevalent. It would be long term holders selling to new people entering the market, and those new people would now become the new long term holders. However there is one set back for this to happen efficiently which i've also realized and that is that most people are weak hands, and will sell to stronger hands of which there are way fewer.

Okcoin looks like a shitcoin on bittrex now. Neither of these things are good for market makers or traders. And also bad for investors.  
There is no reason to like a communist government telling the market what to do. They want stability but do things that ensure the exact opposite.

Terrorism is manufactured so they can have the excuse to impinge on our financial freedom. They know this, they've been using this trick for the past two decades successfully. They know the Euro is a fucking shitcoin of mass proportions however they would like to maintain their monopoly on violence that forces us to use their monopoly money because as soon as people actually realise that the EU is run by inept bureaucrats that have no ones interests in mind but the large conglomerates they will use their freedom and run for the exits, which will be free market currencies such as bitcoin. They're trying to shut those exit doors now or make them really tight to run through. /rant

It is because they want to implement NIRP as it is the only way to reduce debt. In essence money in your bank will essentially burn at a -% rate. The only way that they can implement this measure is if there is no cash or bitcoin to allow people to withdraw their money from the bank. This will prevent bank runs which would force the fractional reserve reserve scam to collapse.

It's pretty simple logic. People who aren't long term holders by definition sell in the short term. Also, long term holders are strong hands, whilst weak hands will get flushed out. And you won't get more coins divided among more people because the majority have weak hands and are late comers to the party, i.e they really don't know what they're doing. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:01:25


But it does, wages have been stagnant for a while now. Means people who don't own any assets are fucked. I.e 98% of the world. 
"How does bitcoin take advantage of the inflationary nature of fiat currency better than the alternatives? You are describing a hedge against inflation, many other things can claim the same function, that is in no way a unique selling point of bitcoin." - Because it is deflationary and isn't tied to any share/stock/company/government/state/country, i.e it isn't effected by external factors such as growth or sales or whatever or bonds. There is exponentially more fiat to be subdivided between each unit of bitcoin.  It won't be a hedge against inflation, it will be a profit maker due to inflation.

Edit: a trade at 0% fees is still a trade.
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:44:39
Again im saying its not a hedge against inflation but exponential inflation is what makes it's price go up exponentially. Say only 0.0001%  of all new money created is used to buy bitcoin. That 0.0001% increases exponentially yearly (in fiat amount) and thus there is an exponentially increasing amount of money to buy bitcoin, whilst the amount of bitcoin stays the same. This is assuming that the % of newly created fiat that is used to buy bitcoin doesn't go lower or higher than 0.0001% (bad assumption i knw).

1 Bitcoin will always equal 1 bitcoin but when measured against a fiat currency, which is by design depreciating an infinite amount to the downside, bitcoin will reflect this depreciation in it's price by it's value in terms of said fiat currency rising to infinity or until said fiat currency is completely worthless and discontinued from use. It is simple arithmetic. It is a good time to buy bitcoin at any point as long as the Central Banking debt based currencies dominate our world.

i really dont think you understand the power of simple  % arithmetic, have a look at this site  and then calculate 3% for 100 years for any given amount and then have a look at the graph, you will see an exponential curve. 
also i never disagreed that we don't have 3% annual inflation, what i disagreed is with you saying that it isn't an exponential increase. 
have a look at this lecture here and you will understand hopefully 
EDIT: btc will reflect this value because it will reflect the exponential increase is units of account of different currencies BECAUSE it is deflationary. And also i'm not advocating it as a hedge for inflation, i'm advocating it as basically a cheat code for taking ADVANTAGE of the exponentially inflationary debt based central banking governed monetary system. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 23:43:27

First for tax purposes bitcoin is not a type of property. It's fucking intangible, the IRS and legislators and imbecile bureaucrats have to get their shit together and realise that bitcoin is a completely new thing or they'll be left in the dust when majority of transactions will never touch fiat and never leave the crypto sphere because of their draconian and archaic rules. Good on them i guess, they're constantly digging their own graves and one day they will be so deep that they won't be able to climb out.  
Also you're EXACTLY RIGHT when you say that coinbase DOESN'T KNOW what the transaction is being used for, so if THEY DONT KNOW why do they PROCLAIM TO KNOW that each transaction is a sell/buy.

Yes there is benefit to multi algo mining. Think about it. Currently with bitcoin, only the people who own SHA hardware are competing to be the gatekeepers to succesful transactions and blockrewards. If you take a multi-algo approach you end up with 5 different (in the case of myriad) gatekeepers who compete with each other (and amongst themselves) for the block reward. You in some sense have 5x more the decentralisation. No single actor can hold more than around 20% of the hashrate, unless they of course invest in all the types of hardware that the chain is being mined by, which would theoretically cost him 5x more than if the chain was being mined by a single algo. Also i completely agree with you that the Bitcoin network is more secure due to ASICS, what i'm trying to saying is that ASICS and GPUS and CPUS can all mine on the same chain making it EVEN more secure and decentralized.  
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:42:27

4. Who gives a fuck about Hacker News, afaik it's a blogging platform and they don't develop or use bitcoin. 
5. Shorting is good. Shorts are a promise to buy back. If you short on Bitmex even better, you get more bitcoin.  
6. I don't spend a second on speculating on Tether and never have. It's your own choice if you wish to waste time speculating. Just use an exchange that has real USD pairs such as Gdax or bitstamp.

Wrong. They had 0% fees because they were running their own market making algo's which made them profit and let them actually increase liquidity as a result of more profit. Now go take a look at the 5 minute chart and see for yourself that the price now slips stupid amounts with 15-20 btc market orders, which wasn't happening before. So they had zero fees not to promote themselves as "most liquid", but to actually BE the "most liquid" exchanges. If you can't understand that, there's no helping YOU.
@_date: 2016-11-11 15:03:53
You guys should definitely check out myriadcoin which proposes that multiple algorithms should be able to work on a single chain in order to increase decentralisation. So people with gpus/cpus can mine as many coins as those guys with next level ASICs. Many more benefits come with multi algo but this is just one of them :)

That's a feature. Not a bug. In the fiat world you have taxes to pay back the debt accumulated by central banks and their corporate bank buddies that operate at 0% risk since they can offset any losses to the tax payers, oh and austerity for public services because "Muh banks r need dat debt back". Oh and the top 1% can just offshore their money whilst the middle class gets footed the bill. The social win of BTC is that anyone can offshore their money now and opt out of the fiat scam.

Have you enabled upnp port mapping and checked the allow incoming connections in the qt settings? 
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:01:57
not if you have a pruned node
with a non pruned node set txindex=1 in the bitcoin.conf and now you can query every block + its transactions through the rpc
beware tho this is EXTREMELY slow if youre gonna xfer into an sqldb.. its better and faster to read block data directly for the blk.dat files
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:43:08
also i think i might of misunderstood what you meant. Port 8333 is used by the btc client to listen for incoming connections, you have to make sure that it's open on both your router and firewall, thus you also need a static IP. Take a look at this thread 
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:13:16
The reason it says that the tx doesn't exist is because the tx's hasn't been relayed yet to the node you checked on.
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:02:21
Or when your assets are priced within the context of an expanding monetary base(which is always), i.e inflation, so when the exponential money expansion through debt ceases, asset prices will collapse and the whole system will grind to a dreary halt and reverse. So as long as you keep increasing the monetary base, i.e exponential infinite "printing" of new money through debt you will be fine, only the rich (holding assets/bitcoin ;)) will get richer whilst the poor(not holding assets) will get much poorer, a transfer of wealth that has been going on for the past century. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:07:03
Go to your bitcoin.conf file (if one doesn't exist create one), it is located in your bitcoin directory where your wallet.dat is and add the line 
    rpcport=8321
or anything else than 8333. That did the trick for me :) 
edit: oh and remember to enable upnp mapping and allow incoming connections under the networks tab in the bitcoinqt settings. This should increase the amount of nodes you connect to :)
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:20:34

You'd want to dollar cost average your way into the market. So instead of buying 500k at once you spread your buys over a period of a year or so. Also try to buy some alt coins as they can have insane gains but for that you would need to be a trader not an investor. And have a read here:

Well mining btc is highly specialized as of now so you'd be better off mining an altcoin. If i were to recommend one id reccomend myriadcoin. You can mine it with your gpu and cpu and even your android phone and receive payouts. reddit.com@_date: 2016-10-15 09:16:52

Funding a LN wallet is the same as opening a channel, i believe. You fund by opening a channel (making a tx with a fee). You can then use this channel to receive and make LN payments, provided that the channel opened has routing options to wherever you want to spend or receive coins.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:01:39
Yea but amazon by default de anonymizes you when u put in ur shipping address. Now if u pay with LN its no different than payin with an exact amount of cash, or credit card or any other means of payment. They will see the payments u made to them and ur ip + shipping adress.. nothing changes lol

police and street lights constitute less than 5% of tax revenue. I hear this inane arguement every time when some one "loves" taxes. Your taxes go towards war and and paying interest on debt accumulated by central banks who buy rich people assets. Taxes that are used on public services are minimal.

You can withdraw bitcoin tho.. so you buy btc with your profits and send it away to another exchange where you can sell it and then withdraw fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:14:41
naa taxes are deffo not part of btc lmao, if anything taxes slow adoption and extract value from bitcoin. capital gains tax on btc is like cancer. tax money can't be used to reinvest into the btc ecosystem because you guessed it its not ur money anymore!

Because it would wipe out the current system which sells off the unborn through debt and leverages the entire population to become debt serfs. I want this financial system to collapse for the same reason intellectuals in the middle ages wanted to end the rule of monarchs over serfs..

"I honestly don't think Roger Ver even cares about Bitcoin Cash I think he's doing it as a honey pot to make Bitcoin hardened against such attacks in the future. It's a win win for him.". tbh ive given that some thought and it has merit. if u think about he also had a shit ton of btc and thus also bch. him and his buddies are using their stashes to market make btc/bch and squeeze coins out of ppl, by forking btc instead of making a new alt they also got some existing hodlors to switch over. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:52:36
Yes blame the banks, for when they failed because they gambled with toxic assets/loans they lost! They should of been wiped out then and there!! But of course they would of lost a lot of money and that can't happen because they own the government, so they externalized the cost of risk to the unborn tax payer! Now they've been enjoying massive asset price increases and have been getting much richer than ever before, all externalized onto future generations. Debt will double every 10 years now, so 40 trillion in 2028, wonder what currency the new kids will use?? ;)
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:10:44

@_date: 2018-04-16 11:53:32
Yes, people should of bought some earlier :) but they didnt and those who did, took the greatest risk and got the highest reward. Ppl can also make their own coins and try to change the distribution if they wish... no1 is forced to use btc whereas youre forced to use fiat..

Anyone who buys bitcoin should be prepared for the eventuality that satoshi might want to dump his stash. I am. So this whole ordeal is a non event really. It's just a little media psyop. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:42:55
Yes but when banks gamble and lose, why the fuck should me and people who aren't born yet pay for it. Banks operate in an environment where there is a risk to everything. If lousy governments who are in bed with the banksters externalize this risk onto the tax payers, like they've done since 08', ITS NOT OK! I'm not against capital markets or debt, i'm simply against having the tax payer PAYING for the debt and losses accumulated by banks! The thing is that these "imperfections" are not allowed to correct themselves because they're subsidized by the tax payer! The banks are almost free to gamble big and risk free because they know that they're "too big to fail". 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:33:12

@_date: 2016-05-30 21:30:40
Well i can think of several reasons.
1. They think that btc is more valuable than their yuan, thus they expend yuan into mining equipment into bitcoin. This creates less buying from them and depending on how many coins they want, could be cheaper in the long run instead of buying the coins straight up (since buying large amounts forces the price up). 
2. They have foreign investors who pay them a set amount of money to accumulate coins for them, maybe they have contracts set up where they sell btc at the price the investor wants them at (most probably higher than market price). 
3. They're mining at a loss but they have deep pockets and cheap electricity and hope that if they limit supply from their side they can force the price up and sell at higher levels. 
Probably more reasons to think of but like whatever

 The Bitcoin is a price. It's value is 1 Bitcoin. It is not something you "buy", it is what things are priced in. I don't "buy" Bitcoins. I don't "invest in Bitcoins". It is like the kilogram. You don't "weigh" a kilogram to figure out how much it weighs. A kilogram is a unit of mass with a specific weight on the surface of the Earth. Bitcoins are not priced in something else. Bitcoins are the price.
Bitcoin is not a price. Bitcoin is priced in dollars.
A kilogram does not have mass. You can't graph the mass of a kilogram over time.
Similarly, a Bitcoin does not have value. Graphing "the value of the Bitcoin" over time doesn't make sense because the value is a Bitcoin. It is like graphing the mass of the kilogram over time.
Imagine you graphed the weight of your average person on the planet in kilograms over time and said that the "weight of the kilogram" has gone down.
