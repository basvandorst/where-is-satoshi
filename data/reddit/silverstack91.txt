I did but fell on hard times and had to sell around $4,500
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:48:43
Thanks! I'll pay it forward 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:25:32
Then and now, it's going to continue to grow. I played with it using faucets in 2013. All I can say is if I can only go back to the future which is the past.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:27:23
Thank you and I hope you have a very Merry Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:37:28
I don't rule it out. I was telling people in January that I can see bitcoin hit $3,500 by Christmas man was I off lol. I bought some lite coin last night and early this week and doubled my money already!

Good post. I'm getting calls from people now who I was preaching to last year and they didn't listen.

Did you send me 0.0003 on 12/10?
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:33:28
JM Bullion - you will receive it as fast as you would when using a credit/debit card. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:59:13
It's amazing. Being a Bullion stacker, I became completely convinced that bitcoin will go far once Bullion dealers began to accept btc as a form of payment. If btc is such "fake internet money" then why would vendors give gold, platinum and silver for it? 
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:21:48
For what though lol.. They can't tracę anything lol. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:53:40
The only people down voting this post are the ones in favor of the fees and we know who that is as a whole.
@_date: 2019-03-08 02:08:53
Yeah. In 2017
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:33:49
So basically it's a way to milk the system and do nothing while your investment grows. Ok.
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:15:15
Yeah it's all rigged. Decentralized yet we have to submit our identity to buy it lol....
If you people think that this is "free" from bankers, think again.
@_date: 2019-11-04 06:36:13
People buy what they can afford. If it's $20 or $300 from each paycheck, it's still something
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:30:26
What's suspicious? Buy, sell, buy send, receive the same shit back sell again?
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:47:40
Well there goes that lol. Thank you
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:59:48
Haha that's the reason I signed in ;)
@_date: 2018-10-21 19:24:34
You're an idiot 
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:45:21
I agree. In 2015 I bought $6,000 worth of gold and silver. If I wasn't hesitant about bitcoin, I would now have $48,000. Fml
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:14:24
I cracked a joke the other day that BTC will be at $10,000 by the end of the year. At this rate, it's a possibility lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:35:36
A couple of days. You can verify with your debit card to buy instantly. Depending on your bank, the transactions sent to your account should appear on your online banking site.
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:55:43
I didn't think this many people would chime in but I'm not surprised. It turns out that if you want to purchase 0.42 BTC or more, it prompts you to go to coinbase.com/ssn where you will be asked these questions. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 08:11:52
I don't know what this means... New to this. Sorry
@_date: 2016-12-13 04:52:16
Yes. It will be very easy. We will simply tell them "Hey did you hear of that digital currency the illuminati wanted to introduce? This is it. It's very simple, 1 microbit = $1.00 and when you have 1 million microbits, you simply have $1 million or 1 Bitcoin. Can you believe this stuff was once worth just $1,000?!!" 
@_date: 2016-12-06 02:56:49
I'm new to the game lol
What I mean is there a way to actually store bits on an SD that's in your phone?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:22:30
I installed electron, inserted my seeds and it shows a balance of 0. What did I do wrong? I want to move it back to mycelium
@_date: 2016-12-03 09:22:04
A chat site?! That's awesome! - Something I would be saying if this was 2001.
A chat site about bitcoin called people chatting. Seems legit.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:35:52
It's NONE of their business. I hope more people pull out their bits today.
@_date: 2016-11-04 20:37:08
What's better than an online wallet?
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:03:43
When I wanted to see how much 0.5 would cost me at the time if I wanted to buy.
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:53:45
Thank you for taking the time!
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:54:04
Thank you for taking the time to respond as well!
@_date: 2016-11-14 15:26:42
What is the most dependable online wallet where you can not only store but also buy some coin?
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:28:03
I'm interested. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 22:45:40
Won't be saying that when takes his shit once they get married then divorced
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:47:20
Thank you very much. I wasn't aware of that
@_date: 2019-12-26 09:52:51
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:09:10
What a bunch of BS
@_date: 2019-12-26 09:53:19
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:37:36
CIRCLE? LOL.... you don't know shit. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 03:35:55
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:19:07
Bitcoin Ticker
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:48:44
I'm not tech savvy. So I download Electron Cash, wait for it to fork, then send the bits to Electron Cash and then use that seed to bring it back to your electrum wallet on your phone/computer?
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:26:39
Welllll.... I sent 0.0030 at 11:56, just got the email that I sent that amount, let's see how long before 1 confirmation goes through
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:29:48
lol someone should create a diagram
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:01:02
I did it through the site. Wasn't prompted to verify anything
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:18:46
So what wallet app is suggested for android?
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:55:49
No, my paypal debit that has always gone through.
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:15:40
YES! ALL THE TIME
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:15:26
Thank you sir/ma'am
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:41:47
I own a blackberry DTEK60
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:51:19
In that case, fuck COINBASE.
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:29:40
again what's your point?
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:41:35
Ok, now it went through after receiving a sent email @ .... 6:14 PM
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:27:48
What's your point?
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:55:05
Safe? Do you use it?
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:57:15
You can sell it as an item and if you don't get your money or I don't get my coins as a commodity in the state of IL, it can be resolved.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:27:31
Got it! Thanks!
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:27:09
PM me a wallet address 
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:34:35
and meet somebody for $30 of bitcoin? Nah
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:31:29
$300 per week limit
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:15:45
But we are supposed to be "rewarded"...
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:23:17
There is a completely separate platform for buying btc? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:50:56
I don't get it....
@_date: 2017-06-30 08:06:52
Nope. It's what makes coimbase such a theme park. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:53:00
I am very experienced in Social Media and have managed multiple accounts that branded music artists, small business and inventions that didn't work as planned due to internal issues among the the investors so I do have something to offer.  If you have a start up and need social media help, I can help and I'm not expensive.
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:54:04
I've been on twitter since 2007. 86,000 followers, 10k on Instapoop, 2,500 on linkedin and know the ropes. I was a music agent but the company bankrupted after I got fucked for $10,000 for a leg of shows in Bali and Jakarta Indonesia. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:56:21
Not many people can say that they've been paid to send out a tweet promoting Walgreens for $1,000 without being a socialite kardashian. I can.
