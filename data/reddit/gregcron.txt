Hey Princealy - I just made a post here about our service: 
To answer your question re: credit card, you are sent to our third party, fully PCI compliant, payment processor to complete payment.  We do not see your card number.
I hope you'll use us again!

The markup is 15% over what you'll typically find on the big exchanges.
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:32:12
Hi - yes the percentage markup is fixed so you'll pay the same price per coin no matter how big of a purchase you make. The price you see is the final price you pay. Hope you try us out!
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:32:20
We operate at a percentage markup which puts our price per coin more expensive than a traditional big exchange. You can see the prices at our site when you click 'make a purchase'.  The price you see is the final price you pay- there are no additional fees. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:52:23
Yes, that should be roughly correct for the markup on 1 full BTC right now.  
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:31:06
Hi- no, this is a standard credit card checkout. It will be coded as a standard purchase and not any kind of cash advance or anything like that. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:57:45
Unfortunately not.  It doesn't look like we're going to be able to relaunch with PayPal in the foreseeable future.

Hey - So you won't be able to proceed past that step if you're not yet verified.
To become verified:  Email support with the requested information.  You'll get a reply stating that you've been approved.
Once approved, your email address is whitelisted with your limit, and entering your email address in that last stage you mentioned will allow you to proceed and check out.
I hope that clarifies things.

Gift cards probably don't support cash advance, which Circle uses. My card charges 3% for cash advance.

Greg from WeSellDoges here - I debated whether or not to send the note I did.  This is the second time GoCoin has sent this type of public CC email.  I decided I would limit my response to an introduction, rather than comment on the annoyance of the email or comparison of security practices. 
The email created a unique opportunity for me to reach a large audience, and I felt a bit annoyed that the email directly impacted the amount of spam/phishing coming to our support email.  At the end of the day, perhaps it was a tasteless way of taking advantage of a company's mistake.  
@_date: 2014-10-01 00:35:12
We sell dogecoin, reddcoin, and Darkcoin via Paypal at our sites housed under WeSellCrypto.com. we haven't been brave enough to tackle the bitcoin giant yet, though.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:44:14
Many of the perceived benefits of Bitcoin also prevent things like this from being possible. Coinbase isn't willing to accept the risk in sending non-reversable bitcoins because your payment may not end up clearing.  They essentially have the instant buy option for up to $1000 but it's too risk to do more. 
I run WeSellCrypto where you can instant buy Redd, Doge, and dark via Paypal with instant delivery. However, we have to charge a premium for fees and risk, so its a convenient option but not always ideal for huge purchases.

Greg from weselldoges here. I'd.

They're still a money services business subject to regulation, although not a money transmitter which had more strict requirements.  From a previous comment from OP though, it sounds like they've become registered and compliant.
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:18:45
The issue with instant access to Bitcoins is that once transferred, they're untraceable.  This is why only physical goods are covered by seller protection ; you have physical information to tell where the item was sent.
That has to protect them from a lot of fraudulent purchases. If something goes awry, they have the ability to reverse the transaction (dollars) out of someone's account -- this doesn't exist for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:38:08
Yeah - I went on a limb and bought basically as much as I "could" at $850.  Now I don't have spare to buy in the dip, so I'm holding tight and mildly panicking.

I originally thought it'd be awesome to be able to get 1% cashback when using my card, but then called and realized the cash advance would incur a 3% fee.
Also, I previously read that Circle had cheaper rates than Coinbase, but when I just checked they were ~$3 more per BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:46:11

You have to instruct them to pay as goods &amp; services , or have a checkout system, or send them an invoice. If someone sends me payment (I actually sell Cryptos via Paypal) I demand they send as a goods purchase in order to be fully compliant.  In some cases I've refunded and had them re-send payment.

"It broadly defines a “virtual currency business” as any activity involving the storage of digital currency on behalf of others; the exchange of fiat money for digital currency and vice versa; and even the exchange of one type of digital currency for another. It applies to all businesses and organizations who perform these activities in relation to a California resident."
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:53:19
Yep - that works to avoid the fees.
What I'll typically do for large buys is buy right up to a big sell wall.  So I'm buying 20BTC, and there's say, 1BTC in sell orders up to a big 75BTC wall at, say, $225.99, I'll place my 20BTC buy at $225.98.  That way you only pay .25% on 1BTC, and don't have the bots beating your bid by $0.01.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:28:14
Not even just physical location -- I imagine my business, WeSellCrypto (weselldoges.com, etc.) is going to be subject to this because we sell to people in California.
At least BitLicense stated there'd be some less intensive license for small startups.  I don't see anything like that for California.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:36:32
Coinbase is now insured to theft/loss of Bitcoin, which is reassuring.
As far as OP's question - while $270 is super low, I'd perhaps await at least the next Bitstamp announcement before jumping in..  The outcome of that situation worries me, personally.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:28:24
With AML regulations requiring ID submission, etc. (KYC), I don't imagine there's going to be a legal way to implement a decentralized exchange.. while you could perhaps create it, I imagine it'd be a huge target for takedown and sending Bitcoin to/from the exchange would be quite risky.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:41:21
Yet its illegal for an institution/entity to convert bitcoin to/from fiat, or in many cases even facilitate the transfer of bitcoin, without aml/kyc measures in place. This is what I was referring to.
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:27:06
We are always exploring options but since there do exist official exchanges for Bitcoin, we see more of a unique opportunity for altcoins which currently don't have ways to directly buy with fiat. That, and Bitcoin is probably even higher risk for a service like ours.
Regulations are tricky but research I've done suggests that we are in compliance due to the particulars of how we operate. 
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:42:57
Interesting.  While you couldn't pinpoint anyone to be accountable for AML/KYC policy, I wonder if it'd be illegal to *use* the service, sort of like Torrents.  Coin mixing services seem to be in similar territory.
Anyways - thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:20:41
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:30:10
I think this subreddit should have a rule where every post like this (Coinbase, etc.) must contain a comprehensive explanation of all aspects of the account.
In this case - I'd like to know where you're arbitraging and at what volumes.  For example, "arbitraging" into LBC or some other method of selling to individuals isn't arbitrage, it's operating a (unlicensed) money services business.
As I've come to understand banking regulations and AML/KYC procedures, I've more and more come to learn that this isn't a case of banks just being the bad guy (not for this particular reason of closing accounts, anyways), but rather compliance with regulations and often times shutting down accounts legitimately.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:09:49
That sounds like a pretty solid (and legitimate) use case.  Can I ask if your bank would be able to reflect consistent wires to a Chinese exchange and then comparable wires back in from the US exchange?  Or does the flow of funds break such that your Chase account only saw one-way (either in, or out)
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:54:52
Yep, that's definitely an issue.  Mining and selling on an official exchange is perfectly legitimate and a bank would keep that account open, given supporting documentation.
Mining Bitcoin and selling it should result in USD transfer into the account (not USD into the exchange), right?  And exchange-to-exchange arbitrage as you claimed should result in something like $10k to Exchange1, $10.1k back into the bank account from Exchange2.
Here are when things get dicey:
1. Thousands of dollars one-way into an exchange without support documentation for where it comes out. If you're selling on LocalBitcoins or some other direct-to-consumer, that's a red flag.
I'd be curious to understand, say, your last 2 months of BTC history's flow of funds.  Of course not asking you to give real details of dollars, etc. - but I think a general idea of the flow of funds would shed a lot of light on the discussion and probably uncover whatever it was the bank saw.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:32:11
+1.  Yes.  They can request that information.  Not only can they, but they are by law required to inquire and potentially ask for it in the event of red flags such as this account.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:07:20
Sure thing - it's just that posts like this have the ability to scare people away from Bitcoin with the mentality that "oh shit, if I want to invest a thousand bucks in Bitcoin, my bank will shut me down". 
Only way to bring any value to this type of post is to accurately describe the flow of funds (saying "I typically use Coinbase, BitStamp, and Gemini and arbitrage between the three" isn't particularly personal or revealing.)  So far, I've picked up a couple of important things in your comments: 1) it's uncertain where the arbitrage takes place and where it comes in/out of your bank account, and 2) you definitely sell in at least one case directly to a private buyer, which is a huge red flag, and illegal.
Hopefully you at least understand what I'm getting at - often times there are posts here of people getting accounts shut down for legitimate reasons whether they knew or didn't know the legitimate reasons behind them.  Having all the facts just makes for a more informative discussion.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:37:02
This is what I was looking for when I commented above asking for details of your "arbitrage".  Selling to individuals is not arbitrage, it's selling bitcoin as a Money Services Business, and doing so unlicensed is illegal.  This includes selling to a private buyer (red flag). 
I'm not saying whether I'm for or against all these various regulations, etc. -- but what I am saying is that this isn't a case of an average buyer using his/her money to simply invest/hold/trade Bitcoin. (and again, buying Bitcoin and selling it directly to buyers outside of an exchange isn't trading/arbitraging)
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:12:21
Yes we do require at least email verification to use our service - we previously tried even just allowing $5 without verified, but it backfired hard.  I think now we've struck the best balance we can between ease-of-access and protecting ourselves from fraudulent transactions while remaining compliant with regulations.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:20:33
That's a bit of a jump.  I hope that my response to is as fair of a response as I could have taken.  We will be delisting the coin. 
As far as our exchange rate, all of our coins have the same 15% markup.  Paycoin being based off the current Bittrex sell price .00012804BTC.
I hope I've been as fair and transparent as possible.  
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:09:17
We are, in fact, wesellcrypto.com.  We hadn't been involved in the history of PayCoin, but wanted to list any major high market cap coins as an option offering of our service.  
To clarify:  we are a broker to essentially connect PayPal to major exchanges to simplify the process for people to have free choice and accessibility to purchase cryptocurrencies.
As a result of negative feedback, we are evaluating delisting the coin.  We strive to provide a great service and a great relationship with our customers.  If our customer base wants to see something offered or not offered, that's what we're interested in.  Given recent feedback, Paycoin will be delisted.  I hope that's a fair response.
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:15:58
We're fully compliant with PayPal's T&amp;C.  We've been in business since last April, and I have a dedicated account manager.  We've conducted over $1.5m in transactions, and are far from a fly-by-night operation.  Bank accounts shut down?  Yes, that happens.  PayPal?  I'm confident in our open, compliant relationship.  They're the ones winning here with the fees we pay.

I'll be there at WeSellCrypto table.
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:27:14
The most important part is our verification limits which give us confidence that we know who we're dealing with before allowing purchases.  That, and we also run all of our orders through a third party fraud detection system.
With all of the above, we can typically cite the blockchain for proof of delivery and provide evidence to suggest that the rightful account owner was the one who made the purchase.
That being said, we still take losses.  This is one of the (several) reason it's impossible to reduce margins when dealing via PayPal.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:06:24
Frankly, we're somewhat coin-agnostic.  We're understaffed and when approached by a coin that's willing to give some development support and help reach its audience, we're in a position to give the option to purchase it.
After all, anyone who purchases Paycoin is, well, choosing to purchase Paycoin.  Its history, or whether people see any potential or care to purchase it, is completely up to them.
We want to give people options, and Paycoin, despite its reputation, has a sizable market cap so was something we decided to launch.
We're not at all associated directly with any of the listed coins - Paycoin no moreso than Bitcoin. 
With the negative feedback related to the coin, we'll evaluate delisting.

The issue here is that selling via LBC is acting as an MSB, and Coinbase could then be held liable for aiding &amp; abetting an unlicensed MSB.  
While it still sucks, that's the reason within the regulatory restrictions they mentioned.
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:39:14
I have to argue that after more than 16 months in this business and more than $1.5 million in sales via PayPal, I'm probably most qualified to speak to matters and policies of selling cryptocurrencies via PayPal.  I'll leave it at that.

Well, we haven't (yet) experienced a drop as a result of this, which I think is worth pointing out.  We're still on the top end of a price rise, which makes the current state a little different than the examples above.
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:40:50
Unfortunately regulations become more complicated when you transmit fiat as opposed to transmitting cryptocurrencies.  While it'd actually be less risky for us to offer that service, since we wouldn't have to worry about crypto reversals, it's just not possible for us to move into that space and comply with regulations.
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:16:58
Your best bet will be to ask a bitcoin atm operator company like coin outlet if they'd be interested in putting one in your shop. If you own/operate it, you'd be classified as an msb with all kinds of regulatory issues.
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:55:39
Due to the risk in dealing with cards, PayPal, etc., you'll be hard pressed to find any solution without fees.  We're hoping to add Bitcoin to wesellcrypto.com soon, but it'll be ~15% mark up like our other coins, similar to what you experienced previously.  Benefit will be buying Bitcoin directly (you can currently by Doge, Dash, etc. and trade, but not BTC).
@_date: 2015-04-21 22:09:13
Yep - I definitely understand that.  Coinbase's insurance which covers a Gox-like scenario is what makes me comfortable storing coins there (

I forget this is the land where people share half a story to portray themselves as the victim and ____ as the enemy.  "Coinbase locked me out for no reason!" leaving out things like faked credentials or sending coins from Coinbase to illegal services.

Not sure how/if it works, but worth mentioning: 
@_date: 2015-04-04 03:21:45
The issue with Bitcoins is that you can't prove where the Bitcoins went, physically.  The reason physical goods are covered is because tracking information can prove that it went to the physical address of the account holder.
Basically, it's equally likely that the user's account *was* hacked, and that your Bitcoins went to some fraudster and not the true account holder.
That's the unfortunate risk of dealing via PayPal / credit cards / etc.
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:06:22
If you're paying with something reversible like a stolen credit card, yes. Chargebacks happen to stores, etc all the time.
Just for the record, I agree with you that it should fall on the account holder for poor security. I operate WeSellCrypto and am constantly facing these battles.
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:29:48

'think you meant to post this as a reply to deltacoin's comment - I can't imagine that under lawful use and legitimate ID documentation, they would/could lock you out and keep your coins for any reason. Bitcoin tends to attract a lot of off-the-grid, big-brother fearing mentality, hence the "store it on offline paper wallets distributed in various physical locations, etc. etc.".  All I was suggesting in my heavily-downvoted comment was that for me, as a law-abiding, fine-with-ID-verification, Bitcoin holder, Coinbase has been a great option and I have nothing but good things to say about their support and even resolution process when I've had bank accounts closed, high-volume reviews, etc.

There's a limit to the amount of MyCash you can redeem each month ($500/day, up to $4k/mo.).  Also, if you hit that limit regularly, they can close your ability to redeem them at all.
There's also still risk of reversal if the MyCash card is/was bought using a stolen/fraudulent credit card.

We just don't offer Bitcoin at this time - our original intent was to make altcoins more accessible (since Bitcoins already have official exchanges).

Our service, WeSellCrypto, sells altcoins via PayPal.  So, you could potentially choose to buy Dogecoin, Reddcoin, etc. via PayPal and then trade to Bitcoin.  We don't offer Bitcoin at the moment.
You'll pay a markup, which is to be expected for any service dealing via PayPal.

Well, the one I was using used a QR code, but I only bought (never sold).  Good question, though.. I'm not sure how many confirmations ATMs typically require for BTC deposits.  Reading around, it does seem like most require at least 1 confirmation, which I agree would be a pain.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:11:49
There's no application fee for filing as a federal MSB.  Additionally, the BitLicense requirements are much stricter and more cumbersome than Federal MSB requirements.
Also, you need a BitLicense even if you're not holding funds, if you're transmitting Bitcoin.  My service, WeSellCrypto, receives PayPal and transmits cryptos - we don't hold customer funds.  But we will still need a BitLicense for transmitting cryptos.
With a service as simple as WeSellCrypto : you give me PayPal, I give you Crypto : BitLicense requirements are much more stringent than federal MSB requirements.
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:07:53
I see - I suppose it just seemed funny to me to make it out as if it were better than *owing* taxes on Bitcoin profits.  Kind of like saying "Hey!  You could save *thousands* by making bad investments!"
(note: not stating BTC as a good or bad investment)
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:33:28
You can tumble bitcoins to make it hard to track, but I think one of the biggest points is that it'll be traceable once you go back to Fiat (which eventually, most people want to do).  So if you follow the stolen coins on the blockchain, eventually they're likely to be sent to an exchange service and eventually result in Fiat being withdrawn to a traceable account.
There are ways to shuffle around and prolong this process to make it difficult to track.

Ah ok - I couldn't remember what timeframe they posted ; just remembered an announcement.
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:25:00
There are federal requirements with regards to reporting suspicious activity reports, collecting customer information, etc. that are mandated by the federal-level MSB requirements.

Font change request: $1k to apply

Looks like it's hung up just a bit - I'm in NC and just got the notification.  I click "USD Wallet" and get the 'Enable your USD Wallet', then click 'Verify my state'.  It says "Congrats! Your identity is now verified.' (it was already), but I still don't see options in Buy/Sell to send funds/deposits to USD wallet, and can't click 'USD Wallet' without going through the above again.

?!?  Your total P&amp;L at the end of the year is what you're going to pay taxes on.  If you started with $1k and traded your way to $2k, you owe taxes on $1k.  Period.  Is this article trying to state that it's a good thing that if your $1k is now worth $100, you can write off $900?  It'd just come back to bite you the next year as a $900 gain if it recovered to $1k.
I really don't understand this article..

You put in cash and it delivers Bitcoin to the wallet address you provide.  Alternatively, you give it BTC and it spits out cash..

I had mine for probably about 5 years.  Had the same 24v VR6 in Silverstone (the darker gray).  Had lots of modifications, etc. (tasteful ones) - took amazing care of her, but then she got totaled :/.  Sad day.

Yes - just figure out the total profit/loss and handle taxes based on that.

Thanks -- in doing a bit more research, it looks like there may be some type of conditional license for small startups / unique businesses.  We'll see.
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:35:28
Yep we have a federally compliant AML program in place - and we're in a unique position because we can also utilize PayPal's various KYC checks.  It's just a unique position where BitLicense hits us pretty hard as a small-time startup.  I think the federal policy is pretty reasonable with regards to only needing to collect state-issued ID verification for certain limits.
I shared the few big-hitting points to my business here: 
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:09:24
This will be very difficult for my business, WeSellCrypto, to comply with, even though we are already a federal MSB.
1) Require ID of *all customers* - we currently allow people to buy up to $15/day without ID submission, creating easier entrance into cryptos - this won't be compliant w. BitLicense
2) $5k application fee - this is just crazy.  There's not an application fee to register as a Federal MSB (just legal costs associated with filing and putting together an AML program, etc.)
3) Cannot keep any profit in Bitcoin?  wtf is this?  Bitcoin is our base of accounts.
4) Written approval prior to adding new services?  Does this mean that every time Cryptsy wants to list a new coin, they have to get written approval from NY?  That's insane.

File profits as either as income or capital gains.  I'd do it as income as you're, in a way, reselling "inventory", rather than trading market fluctuations for gains.

Other people may have been mining different coins that use a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin.  However, even for those alt-coins, GPU mining is basically over.  Now anyone who's mining is doing it on dedicated hardware (mining ASICs)
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:41:24
Grab all those Bitcoins the US Marshalls are auctioning from SR and dump 'em would be a decent start.

I think they just announced that they were going to have some maintenance downtime.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:35:50
Where are you located?  AFAIK, it still takes 4 days in the US

And.. what?  I don't even think that PayPal fee structure is accurate.
PayPal charges a standard of 2.9% domestic + $0.30, plus an extra 1% for international payments.
... Putting a $200 transfer at about $8.30 in fees, assuming you don't have to convert currency.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:58:14
I haven't heard of any major changes.. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:09:02
Yep it's been down.

Makes me miss my MKiV.  Nice car :)

Must vary either by state or by bank if you're in the US.  One of my latest withdrawals was 4-Feb at 2:15p EST.  It's now 6-Feb 8:40p EST and while it shows in my bank account, it's still shown as a pending transfer and probably won't come through 'til tomorrow.
It still quotes 3-4 business days when I request a withdrawal (I withdraw daily).  
I've never seen it take 24hrs.
