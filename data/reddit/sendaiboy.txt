Exactly. Wars are horrendously expensive and the only way to prosecute one on the scale of WWII - or even the Vietnam War - is to spend more money than any nation could possibly have. ("Buy War Bonds!")
A truly deflationary currency that cannot be inflated at the whim of the government would bring accountability to the actions of the central government and a hard check on their international adventuring.

Thank you, yes. This is exactly what first attracted me to bitcoin and why I am still so excited about the project / experiment! It is the central banks', and by extension the governments', ability to manipulate the base value of fiat that is destroying the middle class and creating a new generation of paupers.
Bitcoin is not just an enhanced PayPal! It is a fundamental revolution in wealth preservation and financial self-determination... at least I hope it will be.

Sorry about your situation. I hope they eventually come through for you.
Just want to say, as a guy living in Japan who has a US account linked to Coinbase and a Japanese account linked to MtGox, it's almost like Christmas everyday.
Buy low sell high... every *freakin* time (thank you, arbitrage).
Seriously, because I can effectively withdraw from my US account in USD (buying through Coinbase) and deposit into my account in JPY (selling through MtGox) and make an almost 10% spread each time (and am paying 0 wire fees and money transmission taxes)... The first time I explain this to friends and family the reaction is the same: "Is that legal??!"
So far, yes.
And for domestic users of MtGox, it really is a great service. Purchases are instant and deposits hit bank accounts in about 48 hours. Don't go hating the Gox because of your home country's tortuous regs and fees.
edit: - but, yeah, after reading through some of those stories... CS is kinda crappy. I guess it's great when everything works; not so much when it doesn't.

 One of the principal tenets of bitcoin is "permissionless transaction." If you, as you say, have skills, and you are convinced there is a market for translation services being compensated for in BTC, then go open your own store... NOW!
There is no overhead to such a service, you can find willing free-agents to help you, and I think Squarespace or Wordpress has turn-key storefronts that you can set up and get running in the space of an afternoon (or maybe an evening also, if your internet skills are slacking (like mine)).

That's a hell of a good question. What we have done, essentially, was to break the Wall Street business down into software and integrate it into the Bitcoin blockchain for less than half of what the banks and brokerages charge.
FWIW, Reggie, The lack of response might be due to the relative unsophistication of the audience (present company included). Most of us here on r/bitcoin are not investors; we don't hold investments beyond gov't bonds or a small amount of corporate shares. The value of what you are trying to create may be lost here.
Have you tried floating this system on Zero Hedge. Sure, there's a small army of BTC haters over there, but utility is utility. And even those of us calling a bubble top in equities appreciate the value of being able to trade - instantly - in Wall St. investment instruments. "Stay nimble" given form!

Gold is a boring asset, but it will reliably retain purchasing power... in the long term (10 to 20 years out), especially compared to cash.

I had a large (to me) amount of cash there until the beginning of January (having sold a few on the exchange when the price hit 1200). I started trying to move little out every three or four days into my domestic JPY account when this sh*tstorm started to become obvious. 
Everything sort of worked until the last week in January. I have one last cash withdrawal request that's been sitting on their ledger, marked "confirmed," for a couple of weeks now. I don't think I'm ever going to see that money. Shame too, as it is worth a month's rent.

I don't want to come off as sanctimonious so take this in the spirit intended: I am honestly happy for you that you can charge more than $4000 at one pop on your credit card without your bank blinking. That ain't gonna happen in my world.
First, my charges are usually under $200 a month on my card.
Second, I live overseas (even though the account is in the US).
A one-time charge for two round-trip tickets from Asia to the US is going to get denied.
I could probably put it on my Japanese card, but why not do it in BTC cash and be done with the whole transaction? (i.e. Not have to worry about paying the balance later... which would involve transferring enough cash around to cover it.)
This is a wonderful example of cultural blindness. Your experience is not that of everyone else in the world. Making large cash purchases is not that easy in some places; and not everyone has access to credit cards or banking services.
Japan is no backwater, but the typical routine of purchasing tickets here involves going through a travel agent, sending them a copy of your passport and visa, them sending you an invoice for the tickets, and (because it's a cash-based society) you going to the ATM to transfer cash to the agency's account. In 48 hours you get an email with your itinerary and confirmation number.
Yes, BTC is orders of magnitude easier, faster and more private. And I neglected to mention that Cheapair is a foreign company (not in Japan). I challenge you to make a 350,000 yen internet purchase from a Japanese company with your American credit card tied to an American address.

My computer recognizes that Trezor is connected, but the account balance remains stuck at 0.00 while it seems to be syncing (the 'processing' graphic of bars next to the account name keeps cycling).

Another karma report... my last JPY that I'd requested be deposited from Gox at the end of January was processed and sent to my domestic account yesterday. I guess they were settling all outstanding yen withdrawal requests before striking the tent.

Really interesting read... People will always seek altered states of perception. Beer probably led to the transition of humans from nomadic scavengers to settled harvesters. Children love spinning around until they're so dizzy they can't walk. The drive to criminalize and punish recreational drug use only harms much more than it helps. 
While I don't do anything harder than liquor myself (tried marijuana twice in college... bad experiences both times), for those who can and enjoy it... knock yourself out (literally). As long as you are not harming anyone else directly (not driving, not neglecting a child, etc.)... where's the crime???  Allowing people to buy what they want online greatly reduces the danger inherent in face-to-face illegal transactions... where counterparty risk can be anything from a baking soda replacement to a tire iron upside the head.

This may not address your question directly but, ehhh, FWIW: I think of currencies like languages. They are intensely personal and we invest (pun unintended) a lot of time and effort in acquiring them, understanding them and doing trade (socializing) in them. 
For nearly 200 years, the US was an English-exclusive culture. Sure there were some odd cultural pockets of German, Creole, and whatnot in various areas. But if you wanted to be part of the dominant culture, you had to transact in English. Now, with a forced mixture of languages, if you want to succeed in business or society, it is imperative that you know some second or third language and be able to operate in it at some level. English is not going to go away, but it is no longer the only path to social achievement.
Likewise with competing currencies. Bitcoin will operate alongside the USD, the CAD, the JPY for years to come. If you travel between borders, your use cases for BTC will become more apparent and your comfort level with the currency will increase. As currency crises arise, more people will start to see BTC as a safe haven instead of the USD (or the JPY if you're in Asia). This is the disintermediation phase (or what I think he calls the dematerialization phase). 
There will always be a need for physical currency at the local level (walking-around money), but BTC will make in-roads against the USD for small-scale, international transactions at first. And, as it gains legitimacy and people become familiar transacting in it, at larger scales. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:56:14
Andreas has been pretty consistent in his evangelicism of bitcoin, based mostly off of his own experiences growing up in Greece and coming to terms with an illiquid and weak currency. (See his talk here:  )
As he states in many of his speeches, if your currency is a "hard" one (USD, JPY, EUR, etc.), then bitcoin doesn't really offer that much more than a speculative investment, a way to make semi-anonymous payments and transfers, and "a faster internet payment method."
But if you are living in a country where the government is truly destroying your ability to feed yourself through currency debasement and/or confiscatory taxes and fees, and the basics of banking and finance are denied you because you are not a member of the ruling elite (which is coming to describe the industrialized world - but that's another post) -  then something like bitcoin could be a godsend.
It could be a path to wealth preservation, capital formation and basic survival.
His sanctimoniousness may come off as concern-troll like snobbery; but it is well justified. There is a war against the common people and they have damn few tools to protect themselves.
Yes, as a privileged, white-collar worker with suburban middle-class roots, of course I want to see my handful of bitcoin tokens rise in value so I can have some nice things or just a warm, safe place to retire to in the future. But bitcoin could be a way to creatively destroy the upper echelons of society that are engorging themselves on the wealth of the population and redistribute that value along meritocratic lines.
Some people will always be poor because they do things that make them poor. But there is a huge section of the population that simply want to earn their keep and keep their earnings. Bitcoin might allow for that. To Andreas, getting bitcoin into the hands of the 3rd world's "middle-class" is an issue of life and death.

Agreed. Roger Ver should take some talking points notes from Seaman. This is the presentation he should have made this week. Seaman correctly harps on the main value proposition of bitcoin - its ability to drastically curtail the power the state has to use monetary policy as a tool of power entrenchment and corruption (not to mention death, debt and enslavement). And yet David expresses this all eloquently while not betraying any more heightened emotion than one might when talking about laying out a garden.

Came here to say this. btc-noob is letting his cultural biases show. Not everywhere is the US - The value proposition of BTC is that it gives banking powers to those who live under arbitrary banking rules and regulations, or a complete lack of secure banking services. IOW, BTC is NOT just a better PayPal. It is access to the monetary freedom and convenience that   the US and other countries obviously take as granted.
Like I said above, I'm really happy for you that you and your bank are BFFs and they have no problem with you dropping a $4000+ charge on your card. Not everyone enjoys that privilege.

Teach a man to fish...
Andreas is putting his 'money' where his mouth is by being a voice for third-world adoption and use of bitcoin. If he can help create more middle-class third-world (people who would be upper poor in the US or Europe) wealth aggregators - people who can save their wealth rather than have it bled off through corrupted governments and banks - who in turn can use their capital to create business, fund private ventures, invest, then he is doing much more good for the world than dumping his own, relatively, meager holdings into another corrupt bureaucratic organization like Red Cross or UNICEF.
He is teaching people to fish, to take the tools of production (their own capital), protect it against confiscation and reallocate it to profit themselves and others. Capitalism, when allowed to operate without an engorged and ruthless overseeing government, is the greatest wealth creation tool the world has ever seen.

I'm surprised that MtGox has gotten as far as it has in Japan... given that the same rule is in effect for Japanese users.
I had forgotten this, but the Finance Ministry blocked PayPal users from making P2P payments way back in 2010 - probably at the behest of the banks that were feeling a pinch from loss of fees.
This is either a storm warning for bitcoin in Japan, or it might be a proof of concept (i.e. the government and banks will have a hard time killing bitcoin - although they may very well do everything they can to stifle it). 
@_date: 2014-08-03 12:57:43
The real problem I think (please correct me if I'm wrong... I really wanna be wrong on this) is that Coinbase is turning into a centralized clearing house. One of the original goals of bitcoin was to be a form of money that required no trusted 3rd party... purely peer-to-peer. 
Yet, if you want to buy from Dell, CheapAir, or Overstock, or you want to make a contribution to Wikipedia, you have to do it through a Coinbase wallet. (At least this was my experience with CheapAir - no open address to send bitcoins to. They have to come through a "washed" Coinbase account.)
This completely negates one of the primary benefits of bitcoin, some degree of anonymity in transactions.

Really??? I had a deposit request for yen to my Japanese bank account that went "CONFIRMED" near the end of January and am still waiting for it to come up as "PROCESSED". Good news, it was the last of my assets (either BTC or ￥) at Gox. Bad news, it easily equals a month's rent. 
But I'm in limbo. According to their accounting, my yen are neither in their account nor have they made it to mine. 
I know there are many who are in worse shape, so I count myself lucky that I forced myself to learn how to generate paper wallets (not too hard when you figure out the concept), and that I got most of my cash out of there before everything went fubar.
-Still holding out some hope that Gox can keep it together and actually come back from this. It'll be a long row to hoe, but if they socked away profits back in the heady days of Sept to Dec '13 they might be able to coast and use that time to reestablish their cred. Not hoping so much for myself, but for the public image of bitcoin.

Whatever... I can wait. Bitcorn has been an incredible store of value AND a speculative investment AND a medium of exchange for me so far!
Sold enough of my coins to cover all the fiat I invested in it during the run-up in December and bought a computer with the clean profits. With what's left, it's in paper wallets and I have no plans to touch it for a few years.
Either this will end in zero or a lot of zeros... but either way - it's risk-free now.

And if Bitcoin could grab just 10% of that market... that alone would push the valuation of bitcoins up to $24, 000 each. Not thinking it'll happen anytime soon, but it's a nice prize to keep your eye on over the next decade.

Indeed. If you think BTC has hit its maximum valuation, then put your money where your keyboard is and bet on it not rising any further. I, for one, will continue to hold my handful of coins (figuratively) and keep buying a fraction a week. 
The world is moving to a decentralized, "sharing" economy (AirBnB, Lyft, EatWith, etc.) - and bitcoin has already proved that it is ready to swim in that pool. It may take some time and some regulatory battles, but internet commerce will function much better with an internet-based form of currency. BTC is apolitical, aterritorial and disturbingly hard to regulate because of its P2P. It will win out in the end.
But yea, OP is right about one thing; we aren't all gonna become fabulously wealthy overnight - that ship sailed. For us, the 2nd wave of early adopters, we may have to hang on for a few years yet.

value is perception. People believe the USD has a certain value and they are slow to accept its deflating valuation.
IOW, in your mind right now you have a pretty clear idea of how much food $5 will buy you - maybe a cheeseburger combo meal at MickeyD's. But a person in 1980 would have a completely different (and much higher) valuation of that $5 - it would cover about 3 gallons of gas or, if you want to stick with McFood, a Quarter Pounder w/ cheese, a large order of fries, an apple pie, a large coke and a milk shake. That set amount in our head morphs slowly over time... but it does change. (full disclosure: child of the 70s)

Obviously they want this entirely new currency with an as yet incomplete infrastructure and no set logistical support in the market, to compete at the same level as government backed currencies. I say, for a currency that has only been around for 5 years, is still in its beta stage and, until recently was nothing more than the butt of jokes, it's doing pretty damned well.
You can buy homes, trips, cars, groceries, consumer goods, electronics, software, ... pretty much anything you want with it. It does take a little maneuvering; you have to go hunting for a accomodating retailer or take the trouble to buy gift cards, but transactions are happening in cyberspace and meatspace. Baby steps... it may not "break out" this year or next... but it will become more visible. And as other forms of electronic payments become normalized - like debit cards linked to the NFC on your phone - the concept of bitcoin - electronic money without counterparty risk - will become a lot more accepted and familiar to people.

He's right on this point: as an investment, bitcoin is EXTREMELY speculative! Investors had  better be prepared to handle lots of downside volatility and risk. The potential payoffs may be huge; but there is a very real chance that all our dreams may collapse into digital dust... at least on this go-round of cryptocurrency.

You can only make a name for yourself if you offer strong opinions. Being rational-minded and delibrative isn't gonna get you anywhere. Prof. Bitcorn is surely planning to schelp some trade books with his name on them (if he hasn't already) and needs to differentiate himself from the herd.

Jim Rickards rightly points out that bitcoin has only existed through a positive period of economic growth (2008+) (an extremely tepid and marginal period of growth, but not a full-blown, acknowledged recession or depression). So the answer is, nobody knows.
Maybe btc would be seen as a safer haven than fiat... but in extreme situations, people turn to gold to maintain (not increase!) purchasing power. I think the deflationary aspects of BTC may make themselves known in a strong recessionary environment. It might gain legitimacy as it did after the Cyprus bail-ins. 
Personally, I, like the previous poster, am saving in gold and bitcoin, not fiat.

Have not even looked at the other comments yet... Just want to say - you don't want to do this. Diversify! I am a huge bull and believe in BTC in the long run. But in the short run, the price may crash and you have to use fiat (or at least a fiat peg; BTC is currently valued in fiat after all) to buy food and pay rent/mortgage. Hold onto to your cash for now. I suspect BTC still has dropping to do and you can get more later.

I assume ANX is making their money on conversion fees. e.g. You use your debit card for a $15.45 meal and they take that amount in BTC + some percentage from your ANX address to process the cost of the meal. This is on top of a MasterCard processing fee?
Bottom line it, if possible. How much will that $15.45 bill cost me? 
Do they also charge for you adding crypto to your address?
The idea is intriguing, and I understand that ANX wants to make a legit cut of the action - but how much is that?
@_date: 2015-07-20 04:37:34
Probably not. The reading on what's happening here is margin calls, and investors (read first-time chumps) are in the uniquely crappy position of having to come up with cash to cover their margin debt, or lose their shares, while selling has been all but forbidden by the Chinese authorities. So you sell what you have that has value - and for now that's property and precious metals... and bitcoin if you have it.
I think we may - if we're lucky - have some sideways downtrending prices for awhile. If we're unlucky, all of those Chinese speculators may start dumping their BTC. /my 2 bits.

Maybe OT, but - While gold ownership is MUCH more common in Japan than in the US - I would say (based entirely on personal observations / conversations) that it is no more than 8 - 15% of the population who hold ANY physical gold for wealth storage / financial protection. (Compared to maybe &lt;8% of US citizens who hold physical gold.)
There are a few retail stores in large cities where you can walk in and buy gold (after filling out  compliance forms and offering up official IDs to be copied - no matter the amount purchased), but they are usually quiet shops with very little customer traffic. Heck, even Tanaka Ginza, probably the biggest gold retailer in Japan, only sells investment gold from cubicles in the back of their jewelry stores.

Those coins on the paper wallets are my speculative bet. If this catches fire, in a few years they will make me fabulously wealthy. If it all craps out,... meh, it was a fun ride and an interesting intellectual exercise in money and finance.

Similar experience. Living in Japan, co-worker has never heard of bitcoin outside of my rantings. On a lark, and to show her how easy it would be to set up an online wallet and send money, I decided to give her a small amount of BTC.
This was four weeks ago; the amount was ~$4 dollars worth. That 0.03xbt is now worth a bit north of $25.
