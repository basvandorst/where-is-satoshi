There's an argument going on?

I'm not excusing anything, I'm stating an objective fact. The issue of labeling and disclaimers is a real issue but it doesn't change the fact that opinion pieces aren't fake news.

Consider how valuable and powerful bitcoin memes can be to increase awareness. Also consider that this meme passively explains to new people that bitcoin is volatile, which is an important point. 
As a meme connoisseur, I support this meme.

I'm a total neophyte so if you would expand on why it's nearly perfect I would really appreciate it. Thanks for the responses either way.

Winter is pretty fucked here for solar systems though. You basically have to have a generator. Even 5 days of batteries isn't surefire.

Do you think your design could be used in less extreme desert settings? I live in highland desert, nothing like what you're working with, but I'm trying to figure out if I could reasonably manage a setup like yours for sustaining myself rather than generating profit. There's lots of people out here who would jump all over that if they saw it work for someone else first.

I think a lot of people just don't get the concept of solar energy going to waste in situations where what's being generated exceeds storage. Solar is still a foreign concept for people who haven't lived with it. 
I really like your idea. How much land did you buy for this operation?

Uh, what does this mean?
