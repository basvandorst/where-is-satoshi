Why be limited by land and borders. We need to create a virtual city/state or inhabit a small.colonial outpost - .  Why not use Singapore or Qatar as examples. Small areas once tied to larger colonial territories that declard independence. Bitstine forever!

I have been hearing the same cautionary tale over the years. If you don't understand the value of bitcoin and crypto's place in the 21st century, you don't understand true economics.  Crypto levels the playing field - the day is coming when  Wall Street and the Elite will no longer get to decide who gets bonuses for losing insane amounts of money.  Bitcoin, like Uber will disrupt the way things used to be done. The blockchain and smart contracts will save people millions in accounting and legal fees, crypto provides banking to the unbankable and will be a safe storage for savings in nations where the government can change the currency at a moment's notice - don't believe me, ask anyone in Eritrea who lost their life savings to a Dictator's need to take over reserves.

Count yourself out, not sure why you are so eager to scare people off. Is it because you missed buying in the $200 range. People, those that hate bitcoin are either mad at themselves for not investing or actually want bitcoin and need the price to drop.

Exactly, it rose so fast that people don't step back and see what an amazing investment it has been for those who bought only a year and a few days.  I can remember when it crossed 1k, I was in utter shock but held steady.  Bitcoin, with a cap of 21 mil will always have support. Heck, there are always very wealthy people who want that which is scarce. It may as well become CryptoArt for future generations.  The blockchain is here to stay, that much is certain.

Apologies, if I addressed my anger at the wrong person. It is bewildering why so many people hop on bitcoin groups and do nothing but mouth off and enjoy seeing it drop.

Well said. no ideas, no tech talk, just FUD. We will see where Btc is in one year .
