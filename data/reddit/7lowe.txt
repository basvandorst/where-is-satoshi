I was just using one of the sites that gives you BTC for visiting random sites that they send you to &amp; it sent me to Amazon. Would that imply that Amazon is paying them to get traffic from BTC users?

I spent a week getting an account set up with them with my bank info verified so I could place an order. The order was supposed to take almost a week to clear, but my price was locked in at $99. While waiting, BTC dropped to like $60. Still waiting, the day before it was scheduled to fill, the BTC jumped up past my promised price to up over $115. I almost immediately got an email that they were canceling my order as high risk (by which I assume they mean they don't want to honor the price since they would take a loss.) I won't be trying to order from there again.

After the price of BTC rose while waiting for my order to clear they cancelled my order as high risk. My order price was locked in, so the only risk was that they'd lose money on it.

Thanks, that makes more sense.

I'm not in the US though. I tried opening a Dwolla account, but it is still awaiting verification after I had to send them my ID. Tried Liqpay, but when I tried to add a card it said my card &amp; as account were blocked from transactions. Opened a coin base account &amp; got ACH set up, but I'm not willing to place a market order based on unknown prices a week in advance. Opened a CapitalOne 360 checking account, so I might be able to use the P2P to put $ into bitfloor once that account funds. 
On the bright side, this prevented me from buying in at the peak the other day. But, it also prevented me from buying on the lows last night.

My source is first hand experience. At first, I thought the exchanges were just overloaded &amp; down, but then I tried with my VPN on &amp; they suddenly work.

Seconded since I have several hundred dollars in the ether that has left my Capital One account, but never showed up in my Bitfloor account. :-(

They are way too hard to buy. I've been wanting to buy some for several days now, but it is pretty much impossible to do so without expensive wire transfers or really shady looking services.

Same thing happened to me. I did contact them first, but so far I haven't gotten a reply from them. I don't blame OP a bit for posting &amp; think it is good to warn others as I wish I had been warned.
