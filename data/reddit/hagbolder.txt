Well duh, we already know praying to Satoshi daily is the only thing that can do that.
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:26:56
So comparing bitcoin to an unoriginal match game and a program for the shittiest of pirates.  Don't think I get it. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:02:42
His mom has it covered. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:42:23
No one is looking at this dead topic. I'll pass.
@_date: 2015-06-14 11:17:30
It's like I wandered into a worst analogy contest. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:18:26
They won't have to.  
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:51:25
He didn't seem to agree with the gamblers too much either,  do you really want to kill Bitcoin's primary use? 
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:26:34
What part of hodl don't you get? 
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:00:59
Is there any reason why there needs to be twenty different fonts and no discernable reading flow? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:13:33
Because it has been shown time and time again that no one spends bitcoin.  Now hodl. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:24:28
Really? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:01:31
I'm not quite sure what's so amazing about credit card fraud. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:06:00
Those gambling sites do rack up a lot of transactions. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:59:57
He can just give you his email address and you can send it via Google Wallet,  Applepay,  PayPal,  Amazon e-gift card.  Tons of ways to send him money if you actually cared. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:41:25
Normally I just go around the house and turn on every electrical device I own to pass the time in a leisurely manner.  Thanks Bitfury for a better solution. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:14:00
Yeah I'm sure the prison commissary takes Bitcoin.  But sure hoarding useless Internet tokens that you can't spend anywhere is an amazing idea. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:02:33
Then what are they going to buy Bitcoin with? Coconuts? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:57:27
Oh well then. Bitcoin is the greatest thing ever created in the history of mankind. The freedom it provides is unmatched. Bitcoin has an amazing ability to end all war,  disease and poverty.   Worldwide adoption is virtually guaranteed within the next few years.   The governments of the world and their banker lackeys are terrified of Bitcoins power.  All you have to do is make a small investment today and Satoshi will greet you with a warm loving embrace when the new world begins. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:00:22
He is also a disgusting child pornographer and a well known misogynist. So he has that going for him. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:26:30
Mainstream adoption ahoy. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:33:20
At the current rate people are allowed to withdraw it should only take about four years to convert 90k to bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:57:06
We call that throwing darts at a dartboard hoping one sticks. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:27:35
Then I imagine most people would pay in garbage just like dogecoin people would mostly pay in doge etc. etc.  I'm not sure what this graph is getting at other than the complete obvious.
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:55:44
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:23:42
Everyone lies to each other and tries to fuck each other over? 
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:03:43
Look where you are posting.  Try going into and ask if you should follow Jesus,  Allah,  or Buddha and see how well it goes. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:06:38
Guys someone said bitcoin on TV this is huge! 
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:47:30
You are getting downvoted because you asked if you should invest in Bitcoin.   What do you think their reaction is going to be?  That's like going into and asking  if you should use iPhone or Windows phone. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 14:57:42
Generally how a lot of the location  don't accept bitcoin.  Things such as when one franchise location accepts it and then someone goes on coin map and will add every franchise location to the map. Or how some of the locations accepted bitcoin at one point but have since removed it yet is still on the map. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:41:14
Yes we instruct all of our new hires to try and keep at least 3 alts fueled up with karma to avoid thing like this. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:14:11
I'm being downvoted so can someone please link to a single instance of him telling people not to buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:05:21
Yeah bud we are more than willing to help you commit fraud
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:40:52
It is a good comparison because fiat leak is a bullshit metric as well. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:33:48
You are right it's actually worse and more akin to a gift card and shows how little effort was put into the gift. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:12:23
So it will remain wildly inaccurate then is what you are saying? 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:51:57
I agree.  People should instead spend weeks learning about basic computer security,  setting  up wallets,  buying the bitcoin etc. Everyone has time for that. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:58:18
None of those guys just got in the  last few years. So for all of you that have a time machine be sure to head back five years if you want to see a profit. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:07:53
Free Hat! 
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:52:42
I can go on. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:53:36
I think most people gave up when it was discovered that merely closing your browser would prevent any payments from being sent. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:03:22
So the millions of free games available isn't good enough but a  few cents that can't be spent anywhere is going to keep the kids entertained?  On what planet? 
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:02:10
1 BTC = 1 BTC.  So a million. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 04:05:46
I know right.   
@_date: 2015-06-14 00:46:52
Well obviously why else would you keep posting. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:15:23
Yeah just ask Ross Ulbricht how safe his bitcoin was from the government. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:44:34
Wow so many original concepts rolled into one amazing package.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:49:52
Maybe we can have all new accounts pledge some kind of vow to Satoshi to never bring shame to his glorious  creation.   Then we could just set up automod to delete any post by any user that has not pledged to keep the echo chamber pure. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:07:53
Free Hat! 
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:51:21
Yeah I think you know why. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:31:45
OK I don't understand how talking to him means he isn't using stolen cc numbers. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:49:49
Sounds like some stupid B movie plot  Hideo Kojima would write. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:41:37
He also got a sandwich and a personal visit from high priest Antonopolous
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:33:25
Because everyone here fucking knows purse.io is a bastion of credit card fraud and money laundering regardless of hard they try and cover their eyes and ears.  It will just be downvotes,  and no explanation.

About a week ago actually.

@_date: 2015-06-28 14:52:27
Has he ever said not to buy Bitcoin?  If not then this is all white noise as usual. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:10:13
Or a click bait headline on now
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:07:11
Like the judge said, the violence isn't coming from crackheads killing each other in the streets it's further up the chain with the warlords and cartels. He increased demand which if anything made the actual violent part of the drug world that much worse.  Why is this so hard to comprehend. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:29:04
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:31:34
A lot of future regret in that picture. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:00:19
Excuse me sir this and here we like to make up alternate histories to fit our narrative you will have to take your facts elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:10:22
Yes the entire Greece problem revolves around no one being able to get their fiat out.   If they can't do that then how are they going to get bitcoin.   They are limited to like 75 bucks a day to withdrawal.  Online purchases have also been cut off. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:13:28
Most of those are bots or changetip sock puppets. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:51:11
Outside of the scammers  no one has really made any money off Bitcoin in the last few years.  That's why your topic is being downvoted to hell.  The only example someone could give was some dude who forgot he bought some coins back when it first started. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:58:09
Why is it whenever you see pictures of these Bitcoin store fronts or atms you never see people in them? 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:17:16
It would be more efficient for him and everyone else involved  for him to just check his couch cushions. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:41:44
Point proven.
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:56:22
My favorite part is how they changed 6% to 6000%. Not like it can be considered a typo either just straight up bullshit. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 11:18:48
Is one of those features an accurate map? 
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:49:57
This is great news for m-pesa. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:26:50
Uh...no?  A vast majority of people seem to make it through life just fine without ever being convicted of anything.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:12:47
...for a premium of 10%.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:52:27
Shutting down purse.io would get rid of some of the fraud as well 
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:03:15
And just think that half of those are bots and sock puppet accounts. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 00:05:28
Sort of like how it serves your purpose to pretend more than .00001% of the people in this sub were involved when bitcoin was four dollars as opposed to the peak of the Chinese run up. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:43:09
Yeah I don't know how they could find the time over a month and a half to box up a coin and mail it off.
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:04:59
Wonder how many of those are actually still around.   Coin map isn't really known for anything close to resembling accuracy. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:09:21
Nah, he still has to pay a fee. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:12:08
Psst... Nothing. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:21:11
Don't worry if he is anything like his dad he will have one every other week. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:32:46
Just think how far it has come. In only 6 short years it has 1/8 the users as World of Warcraft. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:57:41
Maybe he was trying to make a new entry for the Hitman series. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:29:47
They are.  It's being worked right into their pockets. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:07:53
That doesn't sound too approximate.
 
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:25:08
Of course they are.   Why else would they go back on their word of releasing numbers?  It's easier to send in their paid shill to try and hand wave everything away. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:29:16
No, I have no need to try and comfort myself but thanks.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:37:15
Admins will not even respond when you ask them why you were banned.  I'm sure it has nothing to do with them being under the employee of certain Bitcoin related Ventures. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:01:44
How and why?  I don't see anything relating to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:44:58
Hey man whatever helps you sleep at night. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:12:15
Only to people that consider their time and effort worthless. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:50:20
Just think all the people that just have to drive up and give up a minute of their time at a normal ATM.  They have no idea about the ease and simplicity of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-15 01:30:23
Do you honestly think the average Joe is going to sit and read all of that? Not only that but the formatting is awful to the point of being unreadable. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:52:30
You can already send money via Gmail. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:55:43
Because they are in it for the money and nothing else so they don't give a flying shit what the peons on think
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:49:26
Look man we are grasping at straws cut us some slack ok. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:43:15
Hmmm,  what do you think this would look like if you marketed this in say Dogecoin or Litecoin?
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:53:03
Nah man credit card fraud has been around for awhile. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:15:17
You can stand me up at the gates of hell but I won't back down. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:35:19
Well considering he has already alienated half the voting base I'm going to say no. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:25:13
You didn't find it because no one has mined bitcoin with GPU's in over two years 
@_date: 2015-05-19 08:42:58
@_date: 2015-05-17 00:10:44
I told my grandma not to think of it as Bitcoin but as a world wide ledger and she immediately sold everything she owned and bought in.   This is amazing I can't believe you guys cracked the code that easily. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:37:58
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:04:45
Just ask Ross Ulbricht.
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:07:20
Burning the whole thing down is the only hope now. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 14:52:36
Except this isn't fantasy land it's the real world. If we lived in Fallout world people would accept bottle caps as payment.

Yeah I might have overestimated a bit.   Add another zero. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 13:23:54
It's sort of like how changetip can seize your funds for whatever reason they want. Prove me wrong. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:08:55
An abandoned building? 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:31:17
Which of those are illegal?
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:04:14
Yes credit card fraud is indeed much cheaper than normal channels.
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:04:11
No real world means the current reality we all live in not some idealistic future we are all hoping for. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:38:55
The two guys (Bridges and Carl Mark Force IV) had nothing to do with the physical act of obtaining or accessing the information on that laptop and the chain of custody proves that.  Where are you getting this info from?
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:21:45
I didn't tell you that.  The democratically elected government officials did. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 14:06:33
Take a look at the Bitcoin community and see how infatuated everyone is with Bitcoin's price in USD.  I'm sure you can extrapolate from there. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:05:10
What makes this any better than the already widely available smart sockets? 
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:35:56
Steal electricity 
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:13:12
This isn't a rich white kid with Bitcoin though
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:20:54
Oh I didn't realize the price was up to me. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:10:02
The lack of interest in bitcoin however... 
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:37:50
And who are you? 
@_date: 2015-05-19 07:43:14
It's basically going to be like the rent to own scams.  Instead of making payments on the items they are going to rely on the poor subsidizing their coin production through skyrocketing electric bills. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:28:49
Hellooooo Chinese bitcoin miner let me thank you for your time.  You work a zero hour week for a living.  Just send it on down the line.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:42:44
Sony announced the tech using NFC a few years ago but they haven't bothered rolling it out.  I imagine there isn't that big of a market for it. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:34:30
If the only thing it takes to get Ross to commit a crime is a suggestion then he definitely should be locked up for being a tool.
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:07:20
So is he saying everything is fine there? That's what he did with Gox right up until it imploded. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 14:53:35
They are already way ahead of you as hardly anyone outside of the crypto subs uses it anyway. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:31:15
Knowing that the prosecution had my_criminal_diary.txt that was a really stupid idea. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 18:54:40
I don't think that blockchain can stop the music industry from vomiting out recycled bullshit that panders to the lowest common denominator.  Not even Superman could save that industry. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:03:12
If you haven't noticed this isn't bitcoin world and us pretending it is doesn't get around the fact that third parties are involved and these third parties can seize your funds just as easily as PayPal. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:17:55
You are missing like three zeros after the decimal. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:44:18


Hiring a hitman to murder people that inconvenience you isn't considered a use of force. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:52:36
pefect, i love it
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:54:24
Don't forget how awesome his first day on the job was.   So many downvotes after deleting stuff he couldn't even post here. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:17:17
This all looks so familiar. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:30:50
He is one of Theymos' buddies from bitcointalk. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:11:49
The internet had mass appeal beyond a small niche of starry eyed bagholders and criminals.
@_date: 2015-08-08 22:49:17
Exactly. Have you seen the charts?  All of my zenny is vanishing.  I'm probably going to have to shill to family members to try and save it. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:44:41
What exactly HAS he done?
@_date: 2015-08-04 09:43:43
Their phone number. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 15:55:48
Microsoft was also attracted to the Zune and Microsoft Bob.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:41:29
As long as they have a token of some kind it doesn't matter.   There's really no reason to use Bitcoin specifically. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:44:39
He should have done one of those footprint comics he does but it would be about some guy trying to find somewhere to spend bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 09:33:27
You can just dial the seven digits of your bank and have them mail a new card.
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:31:05
They have mods that work for changetip is why. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:27:15
Mom's basement. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 04:12:53
Yes I hear chicken bone and crystal ball readers are also pretty hyped.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:38:21
Probably preparing to debut that new multimillion dollar forum after all these years. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:24:19
As if Theymos is going to let the community dictate how he runs his scams. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:56:20
So why is this allowed and XT talk isn't?
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:59:28
The guy paid by changetip?  Yeah I'm sure he has this subs best interest in mind. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 00:27:36
Yeah,  it still doesn't change the fact that even if he used Bitcoin he wouldn't be paying his bills.  
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:34:35
Why? What crime have you committed? 
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:10:13
There have been links in there a couple of years already. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:51:52
So I take it from the downvotes that I have been lied to and the government can indeed take your Bitcoin whenever they feel like it? 
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:14:02
That's impossible.  I have been told multiple times in here that is impossible to seize Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:16:31
I don't know, for one I never said Blizard was perfect, nor was I the one that was acting like Microsoft doesn't make huge mistakes.
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:54:03
You shouldn't feel bad for changetip being garbage. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:39:12
Following in the steps of Jim Jones eh? 
@_date: 2015-07-05 03:27:15
But it's not even plugged in.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:16:25
Can you explain to me then at what point Bitcoin involves credit that makes it similar to a credit card then.   Because I'm pretty sure the more apt comparison is between Bitcoin and debit cards or a gift card. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:38:05
I cant think of a single social or political change that Bitcoin had brought about.   Any examples? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 13:19:07
He said this bullshit a month or two ago. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:32:44
Do Bitcoin ATM's come with some kind of bird shit force field?
@_date: 2015-07-01 14:44:59
Hmmm I wonder, will people buy bitcoin or just use one of the other 400 classified sites.  Man I dunno tough call.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:16:05
Probably better to go to a library and borrow a random book for free. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 06:41:03
Right, I was just saying destroying it would save him more money than using it to mine bitcoins.   Selling it would obviously be the way to go if he doesn't plan on using it.

Those specs are more than enough to handle a vast majority of what normal people need for their phone. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 17:50:11
OK bud I'll let you get back to your homework. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 06:17:27
You would save more money by taking a hammer and smashing that video card. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:53:34
What is the point? Not like he can pay his bills with bitcoin either. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:55:33
Josh Garza is the reverse Midas.  Everything he touches turns to shit.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:22:37
He was fired from reddit, I don't know about the others but I'm sure it wasn't pretty.
@_date: 2015-08-04 06:29:32
You might actually want to check who you are talking to. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:19:48
Sorry the mods of this forum are only authorized to take things away, not provide.
@_date: 2015-07-19 17:40:27
Sorry for your loss. I imagine the vast majority of this sub wishes they made any money. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:32:44
So I imagine in the future you will also start removing posts about the banking sector and Greece/Venezuela that has literally nothing to do with Bitcoin?  Or as long as you shoehorn  in a Bitcoin pump it is considered ok? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:37:51
He is a paid lackey for changetip of course we know where his loyalties lie. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:39:15
It's a good thing most people don't keep their money under a mattress.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:20:38
Yeah, that's not racist at all.
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:27:51
I don't know where you are getting you info but WoW is only 10 years old and is only half as popular as it was 5 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:04:18
Yeah I hate apple too I'm asking for why this particular article makes them a disgusting company?
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:41:59
Really? I ask for someones reasoning, a simple answer, and not a single one of you can give it to me and I'M the one that's butthurt.  Ok, keep telling yourself that.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:12:05
Do you guys plan on releasing any podcasts on 8 track or cassettes? 
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:14:06
So basically your comment was useless and I doubt you even read the article. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:02:47
I'm pretty sure at no point is credit ever involved and hence it is nothing like a credit card. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:21:18
Yeah that's what Ulbricht thought too.  
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:45:36
Betteridge laughs again.
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:12:42
Well for one the title is cut off. The actual title is Apple applies for patent for person-to-person payments, secured by Touch ID.
And yet down votes are coming in and not a single world of explanation as to why.  Typical FUD.
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:09:59
I would imagine he is getting  tired of being investigated by the SEC. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 03:43:04
What model is it? 
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:14:12
Right but their market isn't Japan and I'm still not quite sure what with all the bullshit that Apple pulls that THIS is the reason that makes them a disgusting company.
@_date: 2015-07-05 03:05:25
How does it feel to be exploited by the Bitcoin community for their own personal gain?
@_date: 2015-07-20 00:23:42
Any designer worth their salt will tell you where to stick that five dollars. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:05:43
Look at all that love.
@_date: 2015-07-21 04:47:53
Yeah just look at how all the  vc money invested in the dot com bubble turned everything into a roaring success. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 01:00:40
Nah she will fit right in with the other racists and other human piles of garbage. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:40:25
Anyone that was an insider already has the RTM.
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:43:28
You can't cheat bitcoin but you can easily cheat bitcoin users.
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:51:39
$5 is an insult.  Most people wouldn't even turn their computer on for five bucks. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 02:58:24
You can just ask the librarian 
It can be random or based on preference 
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:54:50
Right  but what a company likes doesn't really matter one they are acquired.
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:02:39
Can you explain why other than it makes bitcoin even more useless to the average Joe. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:46:29


Right I'm not talking about fiat or banks.  I want to know which part of that was making love and freedom.
@_date: 2015-07-18 20:48:02
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:26:56
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:32:11
Because that a long enough  time for people to forget stupid predictions like this one. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:57:05
What good would advertising a dying sub do? 
@_date: 2015-07-19 20:24:18
What reward programs? 
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:01:01
If you really gave a shit you would send them something usable and not use them as an excuse to try and pump Bitcoin.

Still waiting on any kind of source even remotely close to 7.  Bitcoin, backed by math, until it isn't.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:20:18
Yes and popcorn time is still a honeypot for the dumbest of pirates?  What of it? 
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:11:47
It's pseudonymous at best.  The whole untraceable/anonymous thing has always been a myth. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:38:43
What do you mean by better?
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:04:42
If it is was they would have no problems releasing numbers to show just how game changing it has been.   But they won't so I think we know the answer. I would imagine they are just pocketing the VC money. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 14:30:49
I'd trust them over some random bitcoiner.  Especially after seeing how often is updated. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 01:17:43
Join the party. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:24:08
@_date: 2015-09-08 05:04:27
Why wouldn't they.  Most people in here keep claiming Bitcoin is like the internet in 1994.
@_date: 2015-09-01 12:43:51
Downvotes but not a single solitary shred of evidence showing the Bitcoin network is capable of 7 TPS. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 04:02:46
What possible reason would your supervision even have to sign off on something like this?
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:34:47
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:08:37
People will just seek out other sources.  If they don't want to look at ads they sure as hell don't want to be nickel and dimed to death.
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:20:04
You mean 2.7

Most people have no desire to raise their electric bill for unspendable dust.

Purse.io is well known to be heavily used by carders and money launderers. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:54:19
The entire talk is about how he claims bitcoin does 7 TPS when it is nowhere near that.  Are you illiterate?
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:10:57
Popcorn Time is a honeypot for the dumbest of pirates. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:15:15
Don't worry the feeling is mutual.

3% foreign exchange fee on top of the $3.50 withdrawal fee. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:25:20
Uh no it has been proven many times Bitcoin is limited to 2.7 TPS there is no ifs ands or buts about it. Do your research. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:11:06
Yeah Bitcoin is supposed to be good at at many things but in practice it hasn't shown that at all. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:41:19
You have even a single source that shows 7 TPS in practice and not just a very early estimate? 
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:02:52
Yet he had no problems shipping explosive materials through the mail or storing them in his home.  His faux concern isn't fooling anyone.

No I think you don't like the truth.
