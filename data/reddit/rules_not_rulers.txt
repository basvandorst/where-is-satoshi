Not really the female population. The whole country just pretends that they are spending billions on "Gold Jewelry" because it is taxed differently than "Gold bullion".

Yes lets cheer the Trump government arresting someone for publishing true information ( In this case, Collateral Murder). No way this will be used against other enemies of Trump or future presidents

This arrest warrant is in relation to the Collateral Murder. He is being arrested for publishing true information. If you think its a good idea for Trump or any other president to set a precedent whereby publishers of true information can be jailed, then I have no words....

You can judge people by their reactions to Assange. Not that many people out there that cheered for him when he was leaking against conservative governments, and cheered him leaking against liberal ones. All about the side, so rarely about the principle. He is a journalist who has only ever published true information. Anybody cheering the arrest of a journalist for publishing the truth, is beneath contempt.

Yeah, I think it is a good video to post in reply to the constant copy-pasta bcash shills post anywhere lightening is mentioned. Andreas debunks most of their bullshit points.

although if you owe money, it arguable a good thing? Bad for retirees, but maybe good for the young if they have a home loan?

Interesting video given the copy-pasta bullshit bcash supporters post all over the internet. Instead of replying and getting in useless fights, we should just post this.

I already run a full bitcoin node, on an old shitty spare android phone I have lying around. I have it pruned to 64GB, but these days you could totally run an unpruned node.
