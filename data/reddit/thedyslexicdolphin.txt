Same with me, it was the first thing that I mined, but it is a play coin like you said

"beggar" typed by a person too stupid to spell it correctly.
I told that fool to get a spell check add-on for Firefox but he wouldn't google it. He kept asking me for it over and over, "plz, plz d00d." Damn I hate beggers!

Thanks, I intend on doing so. I might give all the side links a quick read also.

I know all about Dogecoin, i was, and still am an avid user of the coin. I do agree with every point you made and commend your ability to relate it to another source :)

I'm not saying I dislike dogecoin, but bitcoin has more of a credible and sustainable appeal to it

I don't see the problem with it. "Mille" Translates to Thousand in Italian, so 1000 x Bitcoin = mBTC

I have, I was just asking for the best place to transfer more.

Sounds great! And thanks for the tip!

Sorry if these posts are annoying. The dogecoin posts are a bit more of a joke around compared to bitcoin's. But I promise I'm not trying to troll or anything like that, just genuinely trying to join the community 
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:06:32
That actually looks pretty cool. Why all the downvotes?
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:09:45
I've had bitcoin for about 2 days and I know what it means. Please don't comment unless you have anything positive to add.

Considering Dogecoin only came out in December, you didn't stay on the boat too long :)
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:12:52
Got to broaden my horizons
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:06:04
Yes such rich. 1Ð=1Ð. Doge is not dead.
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:11:30
Yeah I agree, most people are quite nice here. It's just the few elitists that sometimes give it a bad reputation
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:30:39
Thanks, and yeah i've heard.
