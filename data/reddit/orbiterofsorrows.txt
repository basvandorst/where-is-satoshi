Guess it's impossible to hide code in an open source project. Or make tools that can enter and exit on demand.

The us government funded the construction of Tor. Of course they can crack it. Lol.

It's all about the order books, supply and demand. With any crypto. Values are based on who is willing to buy it at X price.  So tether must have buyers or just few sellers. Not sure, I don't really follow tether. 
I personally think this whole dip is because of bitfinex selling off coin holdings in order to have a few billion usd in the bank to match the 1:1 audit... People also panic selling along with them.

Believe what you want. But if I said "hey, here's a completely anonymous browser funded by the US government called Tor", would you believe it's anonymous and use it? Lol.

Hard to believe, I know. But guess what, it's true. Tor, brought to you by US tax payers. Yay!

When you're the top donor, how hard would it be to pay for some nice backdoor access? There's tons of articles on that exact topic. Tons of claims that even downloading Tor quickly and secretly redirects you to an NSA MiTM that dumps you with malware and you're F'd from minute 1. I can't prove anything except the government DID fund Tor, without a doubt. They definitely didn't fund Tor for criminals to just get away from them.... lol.

Some woman did this with 50000 worth of Bitcoin encrypted in a painting. It was just cracked, the address held the BTC for years and she just confirmed it had been finally withdrawn. Not saying this is real, just saying it's a possibility.

He's a holder not a trader.

They magically made almost 3 billion usd flood the market with coins supposedly backed 1:1 with USD. If it's not backed 1:1 then the market was pumped by billions without any real value. Now if everyone holding tether panic sells, they will wreck the market trying to remove 3 billion usd.

Hahahahaha. I believe in cryptos but using credit of any shape or form for buying into a gamble is for morons. This is how you lose it all.
