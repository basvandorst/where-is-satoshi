Makes sense. Upvote.

This is a a good suggestion.  Functional and (relatively) user friendly.

Why?  So Chinese mainlanders can buy and sell some of the 10 btc liquidity currently on offer at bitsquare?  Massive!

that makes perfect sense a.k.a I'm happy to bitch about the margins but yet not motivated to get off my ass and do something about it.  Nice outlook.

Errrm, I'm pretty sure they're next.

The fact they are completely rebuilding probably means they don't know what/where the exploit is (which is much worse than being able to simply patch the exploit).  Taking the entire site offline was likely they're only real viable option.

Completely down for me.

I was about to post something very similar, more along the lines of:
"What commission do you believe is fair and have you calculated the ROI for purchasing a Lamassu ATM and furthermore maintaining it, if so please can you kindly share said analysis".

Merkle-tree and associated so call 'solvency-proof' tools are so overrated.  Does not at all take into consideration fiat. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:00:11
Simply because they're taking the opportunity to beef up security doesn't necessarily mean they knew what the exploit was.  Not at all.

Why would the PBOC give a damn about this?  Surely this works in their favor?

I'm glad to have seen similar sentiment when it comes to Bitcoin ATM announcements.  Downvote.

What's Natalie Portman got to do with Bitcoin?

I was under the assumption active trading accounts don't incur this fee. *shrug*
@_date: 2015-11-26 06:22:02
So manage them yourself then.  
@_date: 2015-11-26 05:31:24
This.

If I'm kidding myself and it's really that easy, why aren't you in the bitcoin ATM distribution game?
