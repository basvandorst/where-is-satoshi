I've been in he crypto sphere for a while.  Although not ideal, this kind of legislation formalizes the role of cryptocurrency going forward.  I know there are a bunch of people who want to keep Bitcoin dark and ominous, but if we can legitimize Bitcoin by complying with existing AML laws, it's going to make sure we are around in ten years.

Never trust anyone online with advice like this.  Google is your friend.
That said, your BCash tokens were credited to whatever wallet you had them in at the time of fork, as it was recorded to their ledger as a snapshot.
You want to transfer your Bitcoin out of the wallet and then use the same address and private key to claim your BCash tokens, then never use that wallet for Bitcoin again.

Just kidding, we all know they just took the site down to catch up on support tickets and credit BCH to it's users.  I heard it on 4chan.

All this from a guy who posts on and responds to an AMA from a "Jew in Florida" with:

He seems to invoke the aspects of Satoshi's vision whenever convenient to his end goals, without understanding the underlying causes, and conveniently leaving out anything that contradicts his motives.
This is why Andreas is such a prolific speaker.  He talks to intelligent people, about intellectual aspects.  Instead of waving around brand names like Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash or Satoshi, he talks about the underlying fundamentals and allows you to draw your own conclusions.
This reminds me of an article I read about the emails claiming to be a Nigerian Prince that wants you to cash a check for him.  The emails are wrought with spelling errors, not because the sender is illiterate, but the target audience is.  Only those people who aren't turned off by terrible spelling and grammar will actually be stupid enough to cash a fake check.
Roger seems to be either intentionally or unintentionally capitalizing on a few key demographics.  1.  People who don't want to understand Bitcoin, they just want a leader to tell them what's good for them.  2. Bitter ex-bitcoiners like the community who are resentful for a personally charged reason.  3.  The underinformed, unmotivated, and unintelligent.  A day out amongst the general population will show you there are a lot of them out there.  4. Those who missed out on the "gravy train" and want in on the next big thing, to get rich quick so they can buy that shopping cart full of lambos.

Where is the "substantive representation" in your argument right now?  The irony is you respond by calling it an ad hominem attack, by reciprocating in kind.  Big words don't translate to substance, unless you're a 20 yr old sophomore.

Power.  Others have mentioned it, but the world is filled with wealthy people.  Money is like marijuana, it makes you comfortable.  Influence/power is like heroin and meth combined; sure you can bribe or impress women to sleep with you, pay others to do your bidding...but you're bored with that, you want to be respected and you want others to fear you.  You want your name to be etched into history books, your legacy to transcend your life.  Roger Ver talks and behaves like an elitist who is just trying to convince others of what he believes, that Roger is the best.  Why else would he pass up an opportunity to make an appearance at a small BCASH event, it's his small army he wants to build.  He wants to be the next Elon Musk or Bill Gates, too bad he's just a sad narcissistic felonist con-man.

So does the majority of the Bitcoin community, but it's a complex problem that engineers and programmers have to work to resolve.  Increasing blocksize is selling out Bitcoin's future for a quick gain today.  You have to begin with the end in mind, and Roger isn't an engineer or programmer, he's a proven fool who made a lucky gamble early on, probably trying to use Bitcoin to make illicit sales over the internet.

I'm reading a lot of comments asking "what about .... wallet?"
Remember: 


Coinbase and other exchanges own your keys; wallets like Electrum and Trezor, you own your keys.

This.  They are interrelated I believe.  Maturity is also happening.
