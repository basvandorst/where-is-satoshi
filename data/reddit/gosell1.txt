Take your projected/changed value and multiply it by the amount of coin you own.

You could also hire someone to do data recovery on his computer. They should be able to locate anything if there was ever a wallet on the pc, even if it was deleted.

Whatever amount of btc you owned when the fork happened you now have the equivalent in bcash.

Or, you sell it on local bitcoins, craigslist or use it at places that accept bitcoin and pay no taxes on it.

For some sweet Oklahoma honey I think we should let this one slide ;)

Site seems legit but as always be careful anyone looking at this. The prices seem pretty low compared to the market and the bonus “free psu” throws a bit of a red flag.

Sounds like your good to go there. I recently sold something to a buyer in another state, went to ups, purchased the shipping and asked the ups person to hold the box aside till I received the payment. Waited in the ups store for about 20 minutes til I had a few confirmations then let the ups person know they could ship it off. If for some reason I didn't get payment the ups person said I could just take the box home with me and wait til he paid. So yes, you'll just have to hang out awkwardly with the meet up person til you get some confirmations.

Water it regularly and it should sprout some more bitseeds which can be planted and grow more.
