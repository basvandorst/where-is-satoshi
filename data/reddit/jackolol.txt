oh god the bitterness in the thread in r/btc is sooo sweet. I love the tears.
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:50:43
interesting, thank you. who pays for all these nodes hosted on AWS?
@_date: 2018-08-01 11:32:57
this is what makes up decentralization. some people sitting at a table in milan can decide on something, and someone comes along and offers a better solution. people will use what is better, easier and more secure.
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:14:24
put in log scale and all time. ew.
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:26:20
Can you explain to me, why you are so certain on this? I'm not opposing, just genuinely curious and I don't know very much. I would like to know more about the background of this. Thank you, if you have the time to explain.

Actual tl;dr: Miners need to be incentivized to do the job. They will act in their interest.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:12:49
I actually do agree with most of it, but I totally don't agree with witch hunting a person. It's just sad and bad manner. Sometimes I feel Bitcoin is really just in kindergarden. Get the shit together.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:57:13
It's more like a pacemaker for the minority chain.
@_date: 2016-06-04 12:55:35
so sorry about that! panic sold 0.3 BTC, buyed back at 570, lost 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:13:19
you are welcome. nothing is fun when shitty posts are hated.
@_date: 2019-03-28 06:50:26
And where did the bank get the money from they loan out to you? From thin air, and now they get the interest on this air. Amazing business.
@_date: 2016-06-04 10:53:13
I use bitstamp, as I'm from Europe.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:39:51
Sometimes that's just the hardest thing to do...
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:34:24
I'm saying your statements are speculation, not bitcoin itself. Expecting people to "see the solution" ist highly speculative.
@_date: 2016-06-04 10:33:45
they will, when you get wage in BTC, when you can pay the rent in BTC...
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:25:28
well that's some strong optimism right there. It's always a strech to expect people "to see the solution". I would not bet on that.
@_date: 2016-06-04 10:28:23
I'm watching too =) dropping on bitstamp right now!
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:57:56
sure and that's a sound position to be in. I just wanted to remind that this is speculation and things might turn out differently. not saying they will, but might.
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:55:25
just a reminder to actually write down your seed on a paper and store it somewhere well. also you might want to write down your current PW. do it now.
@_date: 2016-06-04 10:51:51
I don't live in the land of the free.
@_date: 2016-06-04 12:25:41
haha sold at the run down, then bought again on the way up. lost 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-04 10:27:24
buy again, it's not too late! specially for the long term...
@_date: 2017-01-26 09:08:46
I really don't get it, why there was so much time and energy spent on SegWit, when a blocksize increase HF could have been done in the meantime. Please explain, as I am new to the debate. I've done research and I was unable to find a convincing point, beyond the increase of the blockchain file size.

I can't help to point out the irony of you holding that political belief while working on an open source project like Bitcoin. As far as politics, monarchy is the most closed source government you can get.
Also I don't think «history seems to show pretty well that democracy is a complete failure». If anything, it shows monarchy is a complete failure. But I live in the earthly paradise known as Switzerland, and I have an inherent opposition to anything that has a sole ruler. My opinion is probably fairly biased, since I adore the political system of my country (a working democracy since like 800 years). 
Monarchy simply sucks for pretty much everybody. It's maybe cool in theory, since it gives a more or less coherent account, but not everything that sounds cool in theory, is actually good practice.

There are elections, so the power is distributed. Citizens give up on rights, but in exchange gain the power to decide on who handles their rights. If there is a state, votes are necessary to avoid continued bad government over decades or centuries. The process can become corrupt, as in the USA but this is mostly due to the two party system, not elections in general.
I'm curious to hear why you would prefer there were no elections.
@_date: 2016-11-06 20:20:08
Thanks for your reply. I agree with you that ruling needs some expertise. However, it is not true at all that you get the worst of the worst elected. As a matter of fact, in a working democracy, you get decent or good people elected, because people want to be ruled by decent or good people. That's also the point why you would want to have widespread good education. So for starters, people can properly judge their choices as well run for office themselves if they don't find a match. It's called equal opportunity. In your scenario that's not possible at all. People are subjected to whether or not the ruling dynasty produces good leaders. Each and everyone of those must be good, for if not, the only way to change the hurting power structure is a violent uprising, which is not desirable for a continued state (it ends its continuity). In a hereditary monarchy that's always a possible outcome. There also is the possibility that someone is ruling who has no want to rule whatsoever. While it is still possible that person makes a good leader, chances are she won't and turn to things more appealing to her. Political Philosophy on Democracy is pretty strong and academic consensus. While that doesn't make it true, it is as a matter of fact the current state of expertise.

Yes please HF already and leave us SegWit!!!!
@_date: 2016-09-17 10:16:36
I don't know what I am doing wrong, but I cannot use circle. I am in Switzerland.
@_date: 2016-10-20 10:11:19
Yes, that's the eternal struggle of any Swiss citizen. You're European, but not in the EU. Check the list. Switzerland is not on it. Edit: btw, it says UK and Europe, to point UK out. The same would be necessary for Switzerland, since they obviously use "Europe" aquivalent to EU.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:21:25
If you believe that, that's maybe why you support monarchism.
@_date: 2016-10-19 15:11:49
– gets excited
– is from Switzerland
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:12:07
haha yeah I don't have what it takes to do that though =) then again I don't know about that, since I entered after $1200.
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:06:19
When it goes below 500 I don't think it will fall much. So selling right now means taking the risk of missing out for a profit of just some dollars. I don't have too many coins, so I won't risk that. If I had money, I would buy right now.
@_date: 2016-05-29 14:49:57
Yes I get your point, but I *need* the fiat to actually *pay* the rent because I *cannot* right now with BTC. I don't have infinite resources.
@_date: 2016-05-29 12:39:24
Yes but at the moment I still use fiat to pay that sweet rent at the end of every month.
@_date: 2016-05-29 12:34:37
aha thanks, didn't know that.
@_date: 2016-05-29 12:37:28
Thanks. I didn't say I entered AT $1200 though ;) I watched it fall, and bought somewhere on the downhill, not bottom though.
