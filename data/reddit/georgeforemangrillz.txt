Don't you think that some of those corrupt party members who make people disappear aren't also trying to protect their assets from inflation or government seizure?  A corrupt party official has the incentive to protect their ill-gotten loot in case they fall out of favor from the party.  They do things like 'invest' in property outside of China (i.e. London house prices are going up because wealthy Chinese are buying off property there), buy gold over the counter, and now buy bitcoins.

You can split one bitcoin into fractions.  


Not with the same type of peer to peer network.  It's the shared ledger that makes it superior to other digital currencies.  The ability to put anything on the blockchain makes it extensible so you can do other things like decentralized escrows, contracts, etc.. (i.e. research Colored Coins)

You just answered my question.  The fact that they cannot overdraft their wallet makes it so that they have $35.00 worth of coins more.  Their pay would be directly in bitcoins and they wouldn't have to pay 30% fee to  be able to use it.  They are much more ahead because they wouldn't have to pay fees.

It provides the banks who wishes to use it the ability to have a decentralized, distributed, and redundant ledger at the cost of efficiency.  There are still benefits to it as the banks could significantly lower their cost of their IT operations.  Instead of them having to maintain multiple WAN/MAN connections to have redundant database storage on replicated SAN storage they could put all that transactional data on the blockchain.

Merchant costs for accepting credit cards are passed to the processors who then pass those costs to the merchants.  Each chargeback incurs them the cost of the charge plus a fee.  If the merchant reaches a chargeback threshold (i.e. credit card data breach) they will incur a fine and the risk of their merchant accounts getting cancelled.  I have merchant agreements from many different payment processors and this is a common thing to see in those agreements.

Yeah it seems like really doesn't understand what he's talking about.  Low hashrate means there are few people using it so they do not have much value.  When their price increases that means that there's more participants in the market (i.e. the network) so the hashrate would naturally increase thereby increasing its security.  You can't profit from the attack if there's no liquidity and there wouldn't be any liquidity if there's no network.  It's a chicken and egg scenario.

Did MtGox return all the fiat currency?  
The people who lost bitcoins with MtGox falls into a few categories.
1. The ones who used MtGox as an online wallet.  These people went against all the warnings about the risk of using an online wallet address that they didn't have control over.  This is a newbie mistake and I hope that they didn't risk too much knowing how little experience they had.
2. The people who used MtGox to sell bitcoins at a higher price than they could at other exchanges.  They kept the coins at MtGox so that they could dump their coins at the peaks.  Let's blame their greed for this.  
3. Online stores who used MtGox as a payment gateway.  They should have been doing regular withdrawals to their own wallets.  
4. The people who transferred fiat to their MtGox balance but have not bought any BTC yet.  
The people that fall into  should get their money back and would most likely be the first people after MtGox's creditors to be compensated.   should have known better.   were perhaps too greedy and just got on the wrong side of their risk.   is a newb who got burned and hopefully did not lose too much money and should learn from this experience.

Actually if Bitcoin becomes a success then we wouldn't need intermediary services to conduct transactions in it.  There wouldn't be prepaid bitcoin cards, bill payment services, or exchanges because everyone would just accept and transact with BTC without having to touch or have its value pegged to fiat currencies.  We would be able to buy gasoline, pay for groceries, and pay our electricity bill in it without having to convert to fiat and worry about price volatility.  
As a small business that does business in multiple currencies the price volatility between the currencies I deal with is a business risk I always have to keep in mind.  The money I make in USD may lose its value before I have to pay my vendors in another currency and that's a risk I have to constantly manage through volatility swaps. Passing that risk and responsibility down to the consumer who only wants to deal in BTC does not make good sense and erases any of the advantages that BTC might have over fiat because at the end of the day they still have to deal in fiat.  
The future needs to be fully decentralized at all levels of a financial transaction.

If you are a powerful government who relies on social controls such as domestic spying and has had a history of spying on your own people why would you fund a project that provides anonymity and makes your domestic spying programs more difficult?
It's not a backdoor on the Tor software but on the public Tor network itself.  For all we know the Tor network that is used by spies are going through their own private network with exit nodes that they fully control.

We only call it a currency for lack of a better term and I think that's it's main problem with its public perception.  People expect it to be currency so they expect it to have all the features and benefits of what they have known all their lives as to what currency does.  So when they realize that it cannot do what a normal currency does (yet) then they dismiss it completely not knowing the possible innovations awaiting that could potentially let it do what they expect a currency to do but in a totally different and more efficient way.  
When the internet first came about many people knew the benefits of e-mail, newsgroups, and chat but many people turned away from it because it wasn't like the telephone where you could hear the other person's voice or unlike face to face conversations because you couldn't see the other person.  Most of them completely dismissed it and laughed at the fact that I was describing futuristic possibilities in the horizon but couldn't yet be implemented due to the lack of supporting technology such as realtime video conferencing and voice chat.  Now my grandma is going on Skype with me and landline phones are now left to service businesses and further losing its user base as more and more internet based services are invented that fulfill one of its features albeit in a totally new and different way.  
That's what's going to happen with cryptocurrency as well.  In the future it will fulfill everything that a currency is expected to do and more but in completely new ways that we have never foreseen possible yet.  This also coincides with it finding true price stability.  We do not yet know the actual value of a bitcoin because most of the killer apps that will put it above fiat currency as the most widely chosen way to exchange value have not been invented yet.  Once those key apps have been created that will allow Bitcoin to realize its full potential then we will reach price stability.  
We future now.

This is just another symptom of the systemic problem of mining centralization that is happening in the SHA-256/SCrypt world thanks to the existence of ASIC mining equipment and cheap electricity from China.  Unless you're a large industrial mining outfit in China it's no longer profitable to mine SHA-256 and SCrypt coins when you have to compete against institutions that not only have direct access to cheap ASIC hardware but also electricity.  
This is undeniable proof that mining is now a game for the wealthy and well connected in China and is becoming increasingly centralized.  Even the mining farms in Europe will soon not be able to compete as the difficulty continues to increase.

The US Government may project an image of a tyrannical monolith but like any organization there are honest and rational people there that can provide the needed checks and balances.

In both situations both Bob and Alice would have differing records since Bob was able to successfully change the results of the audit.

It's difficult to answer that because each and every single one of those services lost their competitive advantage for different reasons.

AOL Instant Messenger lost to Yahoo Messenger for a few reasons but they're not the same reasons as to why Yahoo Messenger lost to Google Talk.  
Blockchain based cryptocurrencies are still new so we will most likely not know who will outcompete Bitcoin until it's too late.  The competitor may exist now or is still being imagined by someone.

They could definitely do that but that would really amount to them setting up a totalitarian police state.  There are some very influential and vocal advocates of Bitcoins and the government would have to silence them in order for their efforts to have any success.  What do you think the CEO of Overstock would do if the government told him he needs to stop accepting Bitcoins?  What would you think the wealthy shareholders that have invested in Bitcoin companies like Coinbase and others do?  Do you think they're just going to accept that from the US Government?
The fact is the proverbial cat is already out of the proverbial bag and it would be a total PR nightmare not only for the US Government (who is already knee deep in the global PR nightmare of the Snowden NSA leaks).  They could have shut it down early on when it was still just a small community of hobbyists, libertarians, and crypto aficionados but doing so now would just enrage a very vocal and influential group of supporters.

Maybe they are teenagers.
Maybe that's the real audience of Bitcoins, Blockchain 2.0 decentralization, and all the new crypto-anarchy tools that are coming out and not the "old dog; can't learn new tricks" crowd because, let's face it, they're going to die in a few decades or less anyways and most of them are already indoctrinated about how the world is rather than how the world should be.
Bitcoin presents us with a completely new way about doing and approaching the transfer of value.  These technologies present us with possibilities way beyond what most people can envision.  Most people have grown up to stick to a single reality tunnel (using the term lightly here) and when presented with an idea completely alien to their way of thinking they feel some kind of almost angry aversion to it.
So perhaps the target should be younger people and teenagers.  Radical ideas require radical approaches.

HUNGH?  You are clearly projecting here.  If anything Bitcoin is the exact opposite of the Gold Standard.  Even Peter Schiff, one of the more hardcore Ron Paulers is against Bitcoins because it's not pegged to the dollar.  


DAOs will change that but instead of removing the personhood from corporations it removes the corporations from persons.  


The difference with Bitcoin is that you know exactly how much is in circulation at any given time and therefore are able to assess your risk accordingly.  Do you know how many dollars are currently in circulation (accounting for what the Fed does not disclose on the basis of it being a private institution and the amount of counterfeits in circulation)?


That's inherent in civilization.  You "buy into" the town you live in by giving money to someone higher up on the pyramid.  You use dollars and give money to someone higher up the pyramid.  You use paypal/credit cards and pay fees to someone higher up the pyramid.  But with bitcoins you know exactly which addresses it goes into and can make better and more informed decisions.

The US dollar and most fiat currencies are ponzi schemes.  The only difference is that they have gotten big enough that nobody at the top would want it to fail.  Ponzi schemes only collapse when there are not enough supporters and suckers at the bottom to let it fail.  As long as people are forced to use dollars then the USD ponzi scheme will continue to thrive.  
Shit, even Amway has survived throughout these years because there's enough people at the bottom to support the pyramid structure.  I think Bitcoins and even some of the major altcoins are way past the Amway status that they're too big to collapse.

Of course at some point in the not so distant future there would be DAO based loss prevention/insurance systems operating as smart contracts on  the blockchain which would lower the overall cost of insuring transactions and provide much better and more fair protection for both parties to the transaction.

1. You're basing your electricity costs on residential rates which are based on residential subsidies.  Once the power company starts seeing large amounts of power use they'll find out that you're using power for commercial use and will end up getting your services cut or bumped up to commercial rates.  
2. No backup power.
3. Fire suppression (do you even Halon?).
4. Insurance @ $70.00 for $100,000 in equipment is highly suspicious.  I'd suggest reading the fine print.  Most of the ASIC hardware have poor records with regards to electrical fire and the risk of fire with these poorly made products are real.
5. Security will be a big problem.  Does your insurance cover loss from theft?

Even news of BRICS trying to get some of the reserve status at least for purchasing petrol products is mostly speculative at this point since that alliance is actually quite fragile both on the political and business side (i.e. they disagree on price discovery methods and volume distributions and each country has its own agenda as far as the type of global influence they're expecting to gain).

It's funny you believe that crap.  Bitcoin mining for individuals is not profitable.  With an average of 5+ months to ROI on most available hardware plus the increasing difficulty it's not economically feasible for people to mine bitcoins.   
The only people running bitcoin mining operations are the ones who can get access to cheap ASIC and cheap electricity which naturally would be in China.  If you're an individual mining bitcoins then you're obviously doing it as a speculative play hoping that the price of BTC will go up to $10,000 per coin or you're doing it out of the kindness of your heart because otherwise you're just throwing money away.

You're a company that has to make profits either through volume or through fees.  The cost of transmitting money to another country is more or less the same and with having to use BTC I now have to deal with two entities that are both looking to make profits off the transactions unless I'm also holding large reserves of BTC.  
Xoom/Remitathome/etc.. most likely take advantage of spot prices through their respective relationships with intra-dealer brokerages and their banking relationships so they are able to drive down costs and make profit from their volume.  


That's what everyone has been saying but nobody has actually been able to deliver on their promises.  Also be careful what you wish for because if BTC ever gets widespread adoption worldwide then Rebit.ph will be useless since most people will just deal with BTC directly from wallet to wallet.

The economic principles of bitcoin is pretty much the same as the traditional one (at least as long as it's pegged to fiat currencies).  It's the technology and protocol that sets it apart from the rest and theres' nothing wrong with that.  The problem is with amateur exchanges that did not have the mental capacity nor the brains to run a proper exchange or banking entity.  
MtGox was ran by one guy with a few contractors.  They didn't even have a proper backoffice to handle day to day accounting.  Their code and software/infrastructure architecture was terrible as proven by the source code leaks.  These problems have nothing to do with Bitcoin and even a traditional fiat bank/exchange would have concluded the same way.

Putting 99% of transactions (assuming it's trying to get 100,000 per second) on the side-chain or off chain transactions would just be as bad and wouldn't gain you any advantages.  Everything will still have to be reconciled to the main chain and at that point you'd lose all of the security benefits.  With bitcoin's architecture you can either have secure or fast but not both.  Any solution to increase transaction throughput would only increase complexity and decrease security.

Bitcoin core uses OpenSSL for for ECDSA operations which doesn't allow you to pass a deterministic nonce explicitly.  There are already ongoing talks with Bitcoin core to move to libsecp256k1 but that has not yet happened. 
So while Satoshi himself may not be able to steal your coins there are already existing attack vectors for attackers to steal coins which have yet to be addressed for the entire ecosystem (i.e. [blockchain.info's implementation]( ) since an economic system is only as secure as its weakest link these would really need to be addressed specially in a decentralized system.

The difference is that startups have a strategy to become profitable and a well defined exit strategy for investors.  With Bitcoin mining you are only profitable when you ROI and only up until the next class of ASIC hardware becomes available to bring difficulty beyond your capacity.  The window for profitability is too small and by the time the next class of ASIC is available you've only broken even and not enough to re-invest.  
Now if you have your own chip fab, some free manpower, and some free electricity I can see how mining might be a profitable endeavor.

Well a few things can happen.  The loss of the GPU mining farms to the ASIC mining farms really started the rise of the altcoin mining (i.e. SCrypt, X11, SCrypt memory model derivatives, etc....).  So I see something like this happening where the SHA-256 mining industry will fragment Bitcoin itself in an attempt to create new SHA-256 derivatives that will allow them to be profitable.  
At that point if there are enough new miners on the new coin/blockchain I wouldn't be surprised if attacks on the old blockchain took place (a la Eligius' attack on Coiledcoin, a SHA-256 coin LukeJr considered a 'scamcoin') in order to force people to lose confidence and jump to the new one with the stronger hash rate.

Spoofing is much harder to do now that SPF and DKIM are widely used.  Usually gmail and other mail services that utilize these technologies will filter these attempts out.  
Coinbase uses a 3rd party bulk mail provider for their advertising.  They normally use MailChimp but they also have SendGrid as a backup option.  In order for those two bulk mail services to be able to send e-mails as  Coinbase has to add some DKIM/SPF records on their authoritative DNS servers.  
Both services have had some history of poor security track records (i.e. SendGrid only uses API keys as an authentication method to authorize apps to act on their users' behalf which makes them vulnerable to password disclosure and replay attacks).  It seems like Coinbase did not do the proper vetting of the security of their own vendors particularly ones that could expose them.  It is better if Coinbase just managed their own bulk mailing to prevent these "weakest link" type of vulnerabilities.

Because DOM based runtimes are malleable.  You are basically letting each user of your app to take the risk of running on a runtime which can't guarantee correctness of the crypto implementation.  JavaScript also rely on data dependent code paths so you can't guarantee that your keys are properly stored in memory (apart from not having a secure keystore) making it an easy target for timing attacks.  You also can't guarantee that the browser your users are running has not visited a site that has exploited a browser vulnerability (i.e. JIT spraying from installed plugins/runtimes, native buffer overflows, etc.) after clicking some blogspam about a naked celebrity.  Let's face it, the modern web browser as a shitty insecure OS that runs on top of another semi-shitty OS. 
With all the hoops you make users jump into just to guarantee some level of security with a web browser you might as well just give them a console app that calls out to GnuTLS or other crypto libraries that will do the same functionality on a more controlled environment.
