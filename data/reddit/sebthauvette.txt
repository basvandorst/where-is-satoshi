Money laundering laws force them to ask your ID. So unless you find someone to buy directly in person, or you pay in other crypto currency instead of fiat, there is no real options.

At first the bitcoin community was full of enthusiasts that loved the technology and the potential it had to allow transactions without having banks or any payment processors involved. 
Then it got popular and gained a lot of value. The community got ruined by people who saw it as a way to make money. After that came all the memes and cult-like attitude you are describing. 
Under all that crap though, the same technical and rational people are still there and working on bitcoin. They are just hard to see because they are burrowed under all the "technical analysis", "portlios" and memes.

It's not a religion. Your analogy is ludicrous. Each project should be juged on it's technical merits and the decisions made by the theam behind it. 
Litecoin has been created with different parameters than bitcoin in an attempt complement it. They also try to be similar in the way it's used in order be share innovation and are happy to include technology that will also help bitcoin.
bcc is an attempt by non-technical people to replace bitcoin by modifiy it in a way that will make it less compatible and more centralized. Their team have shown a lack of technical knowledge that is laughable and every argument they have is clearly based on uninformed opinion or blatant lies.
It's not an "us-vs-them" holy war. It's good engineering vs stupid ideas/power grab attempt. 
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:57:44
I don't follow closely the development of LN so I'm not sure what the state of it is now, but the plan is to open a channel and keep it open for a long time. The channel will be able to transact with other channels, it won't be a 1 to 1 exchange between 2 entities. So in theory you might never have to close the channel.
If LN doesn't catch on, it won't work. We had the same challenge with bitcoin at first; the only way it really make sense and solves a problem is if enough people adopt it. Since most bitcoin developers (the real ones that were there from the start, not the new ones that tries to re-invent their own version) believe that LN is the way to go and is well defined, my opinion is that it will work and be used by most people when it's ready and more polished.

It true that "holding" does not make sense it that scenario, but I found myself holding the coins I bought even though my motive when buying was to use them. The crazy volatility and lack of support from the stores I use daily made me hold on them more than I planned to. 
I won't sell them for fiat since I believe those problems will eventually go away. Until then, I'm glad that the values goes up most of the time. It makes me a bid sad that I spend most of them for virtual items in games when the value was $0.10 though.

Yea that makes sense. I'm still not sure that there would be enough evidence to convict someone but I get your point.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:29:14
If you don't withdraw before the attack, they will most likely revert your transaction since your funding transaction has been reverted by the attack.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:23:43
They can't know who did the attack on the blockchain. The attacker just has to omit a lot of transactions or even create empty blocks and nobody will be sure who did the attack.
The exchange can ask for the coins back but the user has no obligation to comply.
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:50:31
Good luck getting a subpoena for the bank records of someone because "there was a 51% attack on bcash and one of the transaction this guy made was not included in the new block".
Also, running a bunch of miners while one of your transaction was not included on a block after a 51% is not a crime. 
Imagine the attacker created an empty block, by that logic everybody that made a transaction in the previous (now invalid) block should be subpoenaed and accused if there are mining...  
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:32:28

Technically it's the name of the reference implementation of Bitcoin.
That means that they are either intentionally using the term to mislead people, or they are so clueless they can't tell the difference between the name of a software and a cryptocurrency coin.
That would be like "inventing" InternetPlus and calling the existing internet "Mozilla Firefox".

You can't really "buy" or "sell" bitcoins with them though. You can only speculate on the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:41:28
How would it be tracked ? I guess if every nodes in the network compare theirs logs they could find the orignal IP that broadcasted the block, but the can easily be a proxy. 
What other way is there to track who mined a block ? I'm not sure that it's possible. If I'm wrong, please educate me.

They would need to prove this is the person who did the 51% attack. If he only omits his transaction in the new chain, it certainly points to him but it's not proof enough to convict him.
However, the attacker only has to omit random transactions, or even created empty blocks to cover his traces.

I know it's hard to believe but some of us actually care about the technology and ideology behind bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:02:28
Well it's only fixed relative to USD. It relativity stable to other fiat also since USD/other fiat is generally not as volatile as USD/BTC. The exception being countries that see extreme inflation, like Venezuela. With a rate around 1000000 percent, they are better of keeping BTC.
The ideal scenario would be if BTC could be used directly for most purchases at a fixed BTC price.

How much of your savings are you willing to use on bitcoin ? 
What are your short and long term projection ? If you explain your plan clearly it might help. 
Explain that your understand and accept the risk of loosing 5% or 10% or whatever you planned of your savings but you think in X year it will give you X% in returns. Explain how you based your assumption for the future returns.  
Explaining the ideological reason for bitcoin could also help but since you used the word "investment" I guess you're more into it because you expect to sell it at a higher price.
If you just want to throw all your money on bitcoins because HODL and Lambos, it's understandable that your parents think it's a bad idea.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:51:38
That's what I tell myself, and I believe it to some extent. 
I also tell myself that if everyone else except me had spent them, the price would be the same (I spent a coupe of dozens but not hundreds) but my home would be paid in full... Maybe I would even have left my current job to find one that I really like. That's a hard feeling and not matter what I tell myself, I know that until the price stabilize, I will have a hard time using them like I did before.
Having said that, it was a really good experience back then, before the clan wars, the forks and the blockchain spams... It worked really well and showed me what an amazing technology it could be. I hope the lightning network will be able bring back that feeling so everyone can enjoy it.
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:58:30
The price is driven by people wanting to buy it. The value is more about how useful it is, and why would someone want to buy it.
For example, the price of air in general is 0.00$ but it's value is incredibly high since almost every living thing needs it to breathe. If for some reason the supply would become limited, the price would skyrocket since it has a high value.
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:23:37
It's probably a third party that collects the payments so the vendor doesn't have to deal with it. They have to sent the data of who paid to the vendor so they can update the balance. The waiting time is probably to generate the data that needs to be sent to the vendor.

Your question assumes a linear comparison between "computers". 
That's like asking how many bowl of fruits it takes to match the calories of 12g of chocolate. People will naturally point out that you need to specify the exact fruits and quantity to get a correct answer.

No. This fixes an issue where someone who cracks open the Trezor and hook some tools to the circuit might be able to get your key. Sending you coins to an other wallet is useless in that case. Just update the firmware before someone steals your Trezor and you'll be fine.

To add to the other answers already posted, it's not specifically segwit that is needed. It's a fix to transaction malleability, which segwit provides.
An other way to fix transaction malleability would have also allowed lightning to work. Since segwit development was going well while the lightning network was being designed/developed, it made sense to rely on it for lightning instead of trying to design a different way to fix transaction malleability.

At the moment, lightning is still in development and not supposed to be used unless you want to test it and take the risk of encountering problems.
I think that lightning will be useful to make multiple small transactions (day to day expenses) without paying huge transaction fees. However, for long term storage and big transactions, on chain transactions work perfectly fine.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:20:54
I did that when it when from cents to 1$, then the same thing at 10$, then the same at 100$, then at 1000$... Always regretted it. Fortunately I was mining and not buying at the time since it was still doable without big investments. 
My advice would be to only sell a part, not all at once. This way if it's not really the peak you can still get a better price by selling an other part. Of course if you only have a really amount it might not be worth the trouble.
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:47:51

Normally, the file you get when you compile source code will be different depending on a lot of factors. It means you can't compile de source code yourself and verify that the pre-compiled version was made using the same code.
In the case of bitcoin core, they made sure there is a way to compile it yourself that will git the exact same file as the one you can download pre-comiple. It means people can verify that the pre-compiled version was done with the same source code that is published. 
The reason people don't always do this is that it's harder to do.
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:55:16
Bitcoin core is the most used implementation because most of the nodes, miners and exchanges chose this implementation. There is nothing preventing this from changing though.
If they make a decision that nobody else agrees with, they will no longer be recognized as "bitcoin" and a different implementation will be used.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:48:02
Of course, but my point was that it's hard to predict what is close to the peak.
For example, seeing the price going from 10 cents to 80 cents in a couple of days seemed like it was the peak for me. But in the following weeks it went to a couple of dollars and never came back near 80 cents. The same thing happened a lot of time after that.
Of course if we could predict the future and know when "near the peak" is everybody would be trying to sell at that price and nobody would want to buy until the price went back down. Sometimes what seems like a peak is not even close and if you sell all at that price you might never by able to buy back at a lower price.

That might be your opinion but it's foolish to expect everyone to understand what you mean if you use a different definition.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:24:48
I think what you are trying to describe is governance. Of course there is "something" that happens for taking decisions and making changes in the protocol. The governance system adopted by the bitcoin core team is based on logic, evidence and testing. There is public discussions and debates about every proposed change and they try to choose what is best for everyone.
That leads to people trusting them and their software, so most people adopt their "rules" by running their version of bitcoin. However, if they were to make a decision that not everybody agrees with, some people would go with their version and other people will chose an other version. Look at the different bitcoins forks that happened in the past. That's the perfect example of how decentralized bitcoin is.

That'll be my last reply to you because you are clearly trying to "win" the discussion instead of moving it forward. 
One of the most most appreciated aspect of Bitcoin is it's decentralization. (read this with the commonly accepted definition of "centralization" in cryptocurrencies, not your definition). 
You try to argue, on that Bitcoin is centralized by using a different definition of the word then the one that have been used to describe bitcoin every day for the last 10 years. I find it hard to believe that you sincerely can't anticipate that everyone will interpret your sentence using the same definition of the word that they always did for the last 10 years when talking about bitcoin.

What he means it that, if transactions are signed automatically, without human verification, a hacker could steal the BTC by making the PCI express wallet sign a transaction he created. 
It would not add any benefit because the hacker don't need your keys, he just needs a way to sign a transation, which the PCI card does automatically (assuming the computer is compromised).

Your question is confusing. Buying the "dip" means buying while the price goes down for a short amount of time and goes higher after. Buy definition, if you buy the dip you will have bought it below the "normal" price so of course it works. 
The problem is trying to predict if a decrease in price is a "dip" or if the price is going down for a long time (or forever). In general, if you want to buy regularly and keep it for a long time, it doesn't really make a difference. If you want to try to make some profit by buying and selling in a short period of time, it's really risky unless you have some secret way of predicting the future price.

Core implemeted segwit that would activate if it had 95% adoption. Bitcoincash forked with no segwith at all. Segwit2x was proposed with a rule to activate segwit on only 80% adoption (I think) and implement bigger blocks 3 months later. They now decided to not implement the bigger blocks.
The original segwit implementation proposed by core was never changed and never forced on anybody. They even programmed to to only activated with 95% support to prevent any fork if people were not on board with it. The 2x gang were that ones that kept on trying to push things and changed their minds today.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:03:51
They make software. People choose to run it or not. They even included a 95% rule to prevent activation if not enough people decided to run it. That's pretty reasonable in my option.  
A couple of CEOs met and signed "the NYA" between themselves and now everyone must listed to them. That stupid, and that's why it did not work.
For the last part of you message, I was talking about segwit. Core wrote segwit, the 2x gang decided to use the segwit code.
It's simple :
* BTC (wich as segwit) is worth over 7000 USD
* BCH (no segwit) is worth 0.08 BTC
* 2x never got implemented
At some point you'll have to ask yourself why that is.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:43:08
Bitcoin is not a business. It's a peer-to-peer software. 
A couple of CEOs tried to run it as a business and made "agreements" (with themselves) and changed their minds. 
Segwit never had anything to do with segwit2x. 2x just used the code and the name, promised to add something more later, then revoked their promise. Using the code and the name of something else does not give you authority on the people who wrote the thing in the first place, nor does making empty promises that you revoke later on.

I second the typical transaction size idea. In the end that is what we are trying to calculate. Maybe a field for transaction size with a default value that corresponds to the typical size. A link could be included to explain how a transaction is made and why the size could be different.
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:12:16
The way I see it, it would be okay to reduce the block size once most transactions use the second layer. However, this might take a really long time if there is no big incentive for business to implement a layer 2 solution. 
In the meantime, the blockchain continues to grow and require more and more bandwidth. I recently set up a full node and the initial sync was way longer than I anticipated. A lot of people I know don't even have enough bandwidth included in their internet plan to run a full node at home. I'm not even sure I'll keep mine running. I can definitely see why Luke Dashjr is concerned.
A time-limited downsize, like he suggest, might be the perfect plan to test how well it works and give an incentive to move to layer 2. If it causes too much problem, we simply don't renew it when it expires. Of course, like any other change, it will cause some disturbance so I can't also understand why some people oppose it. 
It comes down to how important we see future centralization compared to disturbing the network right now.

In the case of Kraken, XBT was used because the ISO standard says to use X when the currency is not tied to a country.
I guess they dropped that idea when they realized that it would be hard to do that with all the different alt coins that popped up every day. Sadly it's already too late for BTC though.

Different questions will be discussed at each level. I won't participate in the decision of how to implement a specific feature or where to put it in the codebase, simply because I don't know the codebase enough and don't really understand the different ways each feature could be implemented.
However, I had an opinion about the decision of changing the block size or not because it affected the bandwidth and storage space I need to run my node. Businesses would probably have other concerns about things that might impact maintenance or downtime linked to an upgrade.
What OP describes is the type of points that will be discussed at each step. We can't talk about how a change will affect us before that change has been precisely defined an it's impact measured.

His answer was unnecessary rude but he is kind of right. It's not a really great place to ask this question.
A lot of people here like bitcoin as a technology for money transfers and don't care about the price and the way it's used as an "investment", so they won't know much about tax related questions.
Others view bitcoin as a tool to liberate them from government control and don't care about taxes.

The public key is used to receive fund at that address and see the balance. The matching private key is needed to send fund from the address.
Most wallets softwares will generate new adresses (thus new key pairs) for each transactions. That helps for privacy but depending on technical details it might not be sufficient. If you are interested in the details search for "bitcoin inputs outputs".

Bitcoin cash decided to refuse a backward compatible upgrade (that means it will work with old client that don't upgrade, so there is really no downside). This upgrade is called Segwit, and it allows some transactions to be smaller in size on the blockchain. This makes it possible to fit more transactions in a block when segwit is used. There are also other planned features that will require segwit but are not ready yet (like the lightning network).
They also decided to implement a NON-backward compatible change (that means it is NOT compatible with older clients) to allow blocks above 1MB.
In essence, they rejected non-breaking optimization changes and chose breaking changes that required more bandwidth/storage space instead.

When we say spam transactions, we mean transactions created with the sole purpose of disturbing the network by filling up the mempool. We are assuming the intent of the sender was only to create problems and that he did not need to send the coins for any other purpose. 
When you say that there is no such thing as spam transaction, you seem to be arguing that this transaction is as valid as any other. If that's what you mean, you are right but you are talking different argument. 
There probably are spam transactions, since those kind of attacks have been seen in almost any other system ( DDOS, email flood, irc floods, etc... ). On top of that, there was a strong motives for some actor to do it on the blockchain. We can't know for sure thought.

There are no good or bad answer to that question. Like any investment, it depends on how much risk you want to take. The more risk, the more potential gain or loss.
A lot of people here will tell you to just buy as much as you can because in the long run the price always goes up. It has always been right in the past. That doesn't mean it will continue to happen in the future. 
In my opinion, there is no sign of it stopping though. There is no technical merit to the 2x fork so I don't think you should be scared of it in the long run. They seem to have good PR/publicity/propagranda though so it might affect the price in some ways in short term. Keep in my that this is my opinon, not an advice on what you should do. You should really decide for yourself what you think will happen since everyone is just guessing. No one knows the future.
A safe approach that a lot of people do is buy for a specific amount of dollar each day. This prevents your from buying only when it's high. This also prevents you from buying only when it's low. It makes your buy average over the time period. 
It all depends of how much risk you want to take and how long you are willing to wait before spending it or converting it back to euros.
Since you seem to not know a lot about the subject, I suggest you decide how much you want to convert to bitcoin for the year and make daily or weekly buy until you learn more to try different things. In my opinion, it's better to make less profit than to loose money.

That's wrong. Bitcoin Core the project that has been the de-facto implementation of Bitcoin from the beginning. 
Yes, they have the opinion that the maximum block size does not need to be changed at that time. There is also thousands of other decisions that they make in the development of Bitcoin.

You are right, that's why it's almost impossible that the combined value would be more than one BTC. When BT2 is 0.2, BT1 will be 0.8. When BT1 will be 0.9, BT2 will be 0.1  .

That's what I did yesterday morning (around 10:20 EST), when the mempool was empty. I set a *generous* 50sat/byte since there was almost nothing in the mempool. A minute later the mempool filled up. Of course I made the transaction with a wallet that doesn't support RBF without realizing it.
My plan was to split the majority of what I have on bitfinex to sell my BT2 while it was still at .185  . It has now fallen to .114 since yesterday and my transaction is at the bottom of the pool. 
So, while that's a good advice, I just found out that it doesn't alway work out as planned. Just make sure you have RBF on when you do this.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:50:09
That's a really though question because we need to know the number of people participating and their average hashrate.
We can't really assume that everyone will do it because of the revenue lost ( with GPU mining, electricity cost is more than the mining revenue ) and the wear on the GPU. Most people won't risk breaking their GPU while paying electricity to maybe make a tiny fraction of a difference. 
It would be really interesting if someone with experience in statistics could make a best case / probable case estimation for this. 
My guess is that we wouldn't make a difference with GPUs only. I still have an old 30 GH/s ASIC miner though. If we have enough of old ASIC miners maybe that might make a slight difference.

Yes it is. But having full blocks is better than having blocks so huge (because of spam) that makes them hard to transmit, validate and store. 
That could lead to network fragmentation because the blocks would take so long to propagate and validate. That would means chain reorg and lost transactions. 
It would also probably mean a lot less full nodes because of bandwidth cost. Even storage space might be a problem if the blocks were too big. This would centralize both the full nodes and the miners. 
Having higher transaction fees when demand is high (or spam is occurring) seems like a better alternative. At least this will self correct when the spam cost too much in transaction fees. That's assuming there is enough decentralization in mining so the miners can't spam and collect the majority of the fees.

Bitcoin Core is the project that has been the de-facto implementation of Bitcoin since the beginning. It was just called Bitcoin at the start when Satoshi Nakamoto created it.

Keep in mind that anything you use to generate the key could be compromised the same way. Unless you audit the source code and understand every bit of it, then compile it yourself on a machine you trust 100%, you can never but completely sure. You'd need to also trust 100% the compiler you use and every bit of software that runs on that computer, including the OS.
Some people argue that there is also hardware backdoors that can be added by the manufacturer (not the designer or seller, but the people that makes the PCBs and assamble them). 
You can never be 100% secure with computers. The best you can do is reach a level high enough that you feel comfortable.

Bitcoin is designed to adjust it's difficulty to follow the hash rate. It means the number of bitcoins mined always stay the same; 1 block every 10 minutes in average.
It means if there is more people mining, they each get less as the total amount stays the same. It usually drives the price up as they need to sell it for more in order to get the same profit.
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:02:14
I should have said correlates with price increase instead. I did not want to imply this is the cause.

"less thank 5k", which I think you mean less than a full bitcoin has no relation whatsoever with the fork. 1 BTC or 0.00344 BTC have no difference except one being bigger than the other.
There might be reasons for wanting to buy more before the fork but that's only if you want to profit from both chains and you probably won't be able to learn what that means or how to do it properly before that happens. It has a potential of giving you more if you understand it but you won't loose anything by ignoring it completely.

For hardware wallets thought, it could be possible that the wallets was designed in such a way that the keys generated are not "random enough" and allows them to re-create the keys more easily.
You have to trust that the hardware wallet manufacturer was not intentionally malicious or incompetent enough to create a hardware wallet that generates non-safe keys. I'm not sure if anyone has tested various hardware wallets, or if it's even reliably testable. 
Like you said, it's oblivious we should trust reputable hardware wallets more than any exchange.

I don't think that this is better than a second layer scaling like lightning and keeping a 1MB  block limit for a while. I prefer we keep only the "settlements" in the blockchain and let everyone have a copy of the blockchain instead of having every little transaction in it but having to pay hundreds of dollars a month to be able to run a node. 
I understand that at some point we might have to increase the block size. I don't think that we are there yet and I think we should push that time as long as we can so there can be as many people as possible running nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:40:41
For the first part of your question, it's basically that ability that make Bitcoin "uncentralized". That is pretty much the most important aspect of Bitcoin. It's what make sure that everybody can verify each transaction and prevent people/businesses/government to just decide what should and should not be a valid transaction. Miners are also part of this but in a different way, hence why we have the "user" activated fork vs "miner" activated fork. Mining is somewhat harder for anybody to do though, and some people think it's already becoming too centralized. If running a node also becomes too costly for most people, all aspects of Bitcoin will be controlled by the elite, corporations or governments. "Normal" people won't be able to participate, thus destroying the fundamental part of Bitcoin.
For your second question, you can easily find that information with a little bit of reading online. I really just summarized what I read on the subject. A quick Google search will give you a ton of analysis done by people far more knowledgeable than me. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:24:12
The idea is that if the blockchain size increases too much, normal household bandwidth won't be enough to run a full node since most people have monthly bandwidth limits on their internet connexions. Bitcoin is similar to torrents, always seeding to other peers.
If only people with a lot of money can run nodes, it will centralize Bitcoin and give them control on what transactions/blocks/chain they decide to accept and relay.

When referring to "the elite", I meant rich people. 
I found a couple of references from 2014   and 2016   that indicates 232 GB and 438 GB respectively. 
I currently have 300GB per month limit (which is somewhat common in Canada, at least for the people in my region). That means I'm already out. I would really prefer we explore off-chain solutions (like the Lightning network) before we decide to increase the block size. I hope a lot of transactions could happen off chain and settle only once in a while. All the exchanges seems like good candidates, since a lot of transactions happen to fund and withdraw accounts.
Keeping in mind that the blockchain will continue to grow about 1mb each 10 minutes and is already 120GB, it means that initial setup of a node is also a problem for the initial download on a limited connexion. If we increase too much, we'll also have the hard drive space problem. In an extreme example of 32MB block, nodes will need to add 1.68 TB each year. That seems costly.

Data is not immediately overwritten on a drive. There is an "index" that points to where the files are. When you delete or overwrite a file, if there is enough free space on the drive, only the index might be deleted but not the actual file. So there is a high probability that your file is still there.
First step is to STOP modifiy the drive. Each time you modify data on it, you run the risk of really overwriting it.
Next step is to make byte-to-byte copy of the drive so you always have an exact copy.
After that, you can use specialized softwares to try to recover your files. 
You should probably hire a professional to do it depending on your technical abilities. If you manage to make a byte-to-byte copy to a file I could help you in trying to recover it.

When the transaction fee is acceptable, you should spend your BTC and buy them back. This way you will keep the same amount of BTC but will also increase the number of "real" use of BTC, thus making sure merchant keep accepting it. 
If nobody uses it for purchases, merchants are not likely to bother accepting it. This could lead to bitcoin being only used for speculation in the future, which would be really bad in my option.

I guess I'm more cheap than you then. 
Most users don't **need** a full copy of the blockchain when the majority of the nodes play nice and enforce the same rules. If we come to a time when only a couple of corporations can run full nodes and they decide to start enforcing a new rule that most users disagree with, they would now need to be able to run full nodes. 
In my opinion, the fact that almost everybody can run a full nodes is what is preventing bad actors from trying to change the rules. If we loose the ability to run a full node, we will have to trust that "they" will play nice do want is best for "us".
