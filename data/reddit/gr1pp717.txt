Was it really that easy??
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:23:05
idk... it kind of makes sense.  
People are busy for the holidays, not trading (or selling to buy gifts), causing prices to go down, and then once the holidays are over they're buying up all that cheap stock, causing an increase, which creates a speculation bubble... And this would be that bubble popping.  
It's a theory at least.  
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:03:05
I thought that was part of the point here - that the hours worked to buy an item matter more than the value of the currency itself. So, a time where people earned more, and could buy things with fewer hours worked because of "higher relative minimum wage and median income" seems like exactly the point, no?

Enough resources to readily manipulate the market?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:32:45
Is this even legal?  I think they have to pay you at least minimum wage in USD... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:37:47
When would be?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:39:06
It's a purely speculative market. Attacks have power, and this is far from the first time it's happened.

Just FYI - asking not to be downvoted on reddit is a surefire why to get downvoted.  It's not just this sub, but the entire site.  And since this sort of comment doesn't add to the conversation downvoting is a justified reaction.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:35:13
Lucky.  I've been trying for weeks.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:33:40
So... your suggestion is that because the blockchain is flooded, making transactions take too long, we should all ....flood the blockchain even more.  Is that about right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:49:34
What's the thinking here?  That once Goldman Sachs jumps in the prices will skyrocket and people will start cashing out in bulk, causing a crash?  
I agree with the sentiment to get *most* of it out for now.  Better safe than sorry.  But I'd leave a bit in as well.

GDAX can't seem to get around to verifying my identity is my problem. 
I've submitted it twice.  No response of any kind.  Just that everytime I login it wants me to submit it again... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:34:43
I've tried verifying my id with them twice now.  Never get any kind of feedback.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:57:10
No, close the account before replying.  Otherwise they'll likely flag the account for potential fraud and tie his money up for some time.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:20:41
What's the point in that?  Just say 17k... And we want people to see big prices.  See how well the market is perform, so that they jump in out of FOMO.  This will only confuse outsiders.  
Want I want is the *inverse* - where we show 0.00003456 BTC as 34.56 μBTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:41:32
Cool.  But how about you verify my identity sometime in the next month, too?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:36:52
Pull up the yearly chart to feel even better.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:55:43
I think they're implying that they'll keep his money.  Probably tie it up in legal bullshit for a while, at the least.  
He needs to get away from that bank ASAP.

You've received the benefits which taxes afforded you.  Stop being a bum, and pay for what you've received, oaf.

Just because we're using SI for btc doesn't mean we'd stop using feet and inches... or miles, or fahrenheit, etc.  I mean, we already use SI for computer storage and the likes, yet everything else remains imperial... 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:41:48
I had a plan back when bitcoin was like 0.25 to $0.50 to buy $50 worth and sit on it.  If it took off great, if not then nothing to worry about.  I was just too lazy to figure it all out... how to buy? how to store?  ... 
I'd be a millionaire by now had I done that.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:43:09
They most definitely do have a monopoly - on broadband, at least. I suppose you could always go back old school dial-up providers... Well, I forget the technically correct term (duopoly?), but for a given region most people only have a single choice.  
explains your question.  Basically, things changed in a way that allowed ISPs to do what the entirety of reddit is trying to warn you they'll do. And they tried, and are still trying, which warranted the creation of NN.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:17:17
Uh... If the FCC didn't exist then ISPs would get want they want in the first place.  More than that, NN laws *prevent* even the government from dictating what we see.  It's a matter of _closing_ those doors, for everyone.  If anything, letting NN die gives the government _more_ power to dictate what you see and do.  Since now they can just send a request or even order to an ISP.  "block cryptocurrency sites." done.   
Further, if you think for a moment that ISPs wont charge you for access to trading sites, or even for making the trades themselves, you're a fool.  They would.   
In theory I agree that we shouldn't need NN, but since our ISP industry is monopolized we do.  Must have it, even.  Fix the monopoly problem and THEN push for the ideal lack of NN.  Not the other way around.   Letting NN die now will only further the problem of monopolies.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:10:24
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:11:12
Same.  
I had planned to spend just $50 on it when it was like $0.25 a pop. I figured I'd sit on it in case it ever caught on, and if not it wouldn't be a big loss.  Only reason I didn't was because I was too lazy to figure it all out.  ..That $50 would be worth $1.9M right now.. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:19:30
That's romania.  This is the US.  Ending all regulation isn't on the table.  NN is.  And letting NN go while continuing to have a monopoly running ISPs is a horrible idea.  
You're being an idealist at the sake of realism... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:06:04
derp.  Not sure if he meant the typo, but I thought it was @_date: 2017-11-22 11:26:38
It's not manipulation.  Crypto/decentralized currency is a libertarian concept, and libertarians are also against NN.  It makes sense that you would see this sort of nonsense here.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:30:18
?  NN already exists.  And you don't see the government dictating what you do or see online, do you?  
If NN dies you could very well start getting charged by ISPs for making online trades and banking.  Charged for access to streaming sites.  Charges for access to gaming servers, etc... 
To really drive the point home, since letting NN die gives the government the power to dictate what you see online, I kind of hope that once dems take office they restrict political blogs of every other ideology.  Particularly your own.  So that you can get a nice taste of what you're supporting here... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:17:14
It's a long history, with *lots* of changes.  You can read about all of it [here.](
Basically, due to prior deregulations the ISPs were trying to do (and did) things like prevent users from using vonage, inject their own ads, fine users for using VPN, throttle netflix in favor of the ISPs own services, etc.  And, rather than continuing fighting case by case, the FCC just decided to create NN to stop it all.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:12:19
Very.  How do you not know about it?  It's one of the most popular subs on reddit.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:22:15
The ISPs aren't opposed to it.. Facebook, google, etc are, because they know ISPs will have power over them without NN.  "Pay us or you wont be included in the base package."  
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:25:44
Or maybe ISPs decide to take a cut of online trades... Part of an access package.  $100/mo for full access, or $10 and 3% of all trades.  We're really setting ourselves up to get fucked here..

What's that law about article titles again?  
Oh, yeah.  Betteridge's law of headlines.  No.  The answer is no.

1. Everyone here is right.  You are gambling.  You need to stop with the bitcoin, especially "day trading" bitcoin, and seek help. 
2. You lost *your* money, not your sister's.  Stop while you have something left.  
3. Annuities are your friend.  They may be low yield, but they perform well and are *easy* - they also prevent you from doing stupid shit with your money, like you've done.  If I were you, I would put ALL of it in one immediately.  That's your only decent chance at getting some of it back (I would keep everything it earned, and give your sister only what's she due.  You owe yourself that much, at least.)
4. Keep what you currently have in bitcoin.  It WILL eventually go up.  But stop trying to day trade with it, completely.
