You are right! 
I don't know so much but you at least imagine that they use green energy to mine, this would be a breakthrough! I am investigating a Spanish project that uses solar energy to mine. Is called CryptoSolarTech. I imagine that more similar projects will appear non-stop. Will they be efficient? we will see.
I hope the world goes in that direction.

In Spain, they take advantage of the sun's energy to mine through the CryptoSolarTech currency by installing photovoltaic panels. Each country takes advantage of the resources it has, and that is good if users have benefit.
Eco-friendly and sustainable mining
