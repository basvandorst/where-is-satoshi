I think everyone agrees that a smaller (~1mb) block size increase *per se* would be a huge problem. However, it requires a hard fork, which presents a new set of problems.
Also, a 1mb block size increase would only provide temporary relief but it is not a scalable solution. Keeping the block size low has provided proper incentives for work on second layer scaling. It may not seem like it, but i think Bitcoin is leading the scaling race. It has the most resources and manpower put into second layer scaling, which is the real way forward. This may not have been the case if we made small, incremental block size increases whenever we needed.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:01:35
Both these nations are suffering under hyper inflation. Even a volatile asset like Bitcoin would be a better store of value than the national currency. We already know it's being used to some extent in Venezuela, but probably not to a large extent. I'm not saying it would substitute other hard assets (gold, commodities that are in high demand) for everybody, but it is one more way to store value when the economy around you is collapsing.

This use pattern is sort of interesting, where a platform *arranges*, lays out a particular schema, for financial a application. The benefits of centralization (a single, accountable agent who puts a service on offer) but without custodial risk. All the transactions are signed by end-users.  Not sure i would want to plug my HW-wallet in it though, but it would be promising for hot wallets.

They don't act as middle men, they simply forward payments. We cannot scale on-chain in the way you're describing without running small nodes of the network, but LN will make room for more on chain transactions. It will be possible to keep using Bitcoin in the old way if you want. I don't see any problems with LN because i don't see it as a dichotomy. It's just another "app" on top of Bitcoin. You can still use the base layer, which will become more feasibile with less on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:26:17
You can use it already, but it's still pretty unstable.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:21:37
Sure, i don't think it's being used in any major way, and if you're struggling to put food on the table an unseizable asset doesn't provide much value. I don't think we're in disagreement there.

That wasn't a statement from microsoft, they don't even accept micropayments. Every quote in the article mentions price volatility. Fees are certainly an issue, but your claims about no progress in those regards is a complete lie. Everyone is working around the clock on a variety of scaling solutions - both second layers and forks.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:02:56
Why do you feel they act as banks? I don't see the similarity. They are merely intermediate nodes that forward your transaction.

@_date: 2018-01-23 23:37:41
You must be new here :)
The "seemlingly simple" block size increase is not simple in practice since it requires every node to get on board (a hard fork). Hard forks are less controversial now since ethereum basically institutionalised them, but a few years ago it was much more controversial. It's still something most people think should be avoided. I think bcash and ethereum classic are good examples of why hard forks are bad practice.
More importantly it isn't a good way to scale a blockchain if you value decentralization and usage in underdeveloped nations (where bitcoin has the best shot at mass adoption and social transformation). But even in the developed world it would require a very large block size increase to accomodate anything near mass usage. I don't have the link, but someone crunched the numbers a few years ago. Bitcoin would not be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system by any measure. (that said, mining is already centralized, so that's still a problem).
The main benefit of Segwit is that it is fucking deployed already, just use it. Also, it fixed transaction malleability, which enables Lightning among other things. The benefit of lightning is that it enables *real* scaling.
When it comes to miner greed it's was made pretty obvious that some chinese miners were opposing segwit because it made their proprietary mining hardware (asicboost) obsolete.
TLDR: Segwit and Lightning are the long-term, scalable, engineered solutions. On-chain scaling would work as a quick fix, but this would be kicking the can down the road.

Which wallet did you use? Wallet files are often stored in JSON or some other human-friendly format. Try opening it in a text editor and check the contents, there should be no harm in doing so unless you change anything in it. If some words are readable and the wallet looks syntactically structured it is at least partially intact. I know the latter can be hard to be sure about without programming experience, but try googling "JSON" and "XML" and see if any of these common data structures look similar to your wallet file.
Search the text for "seed" or "key" and see if you can find anything. Remember that the key may be encrypted with the password you chose when you created the wallet, many wallets offer this function. If you can recover the seed or master key your coins are also recoverable.

None of this has to do with the rush towards an increasingly centralized world which the EU also represents. Resilience against political decay require that we don't put all eggs in one basket. It is perfectly fine to be a euro skeptic while acknowledging the good parts of the EU.

I live in Sweden. The latest thing here is Swish, a mobile payments app that really embodies a lot of the obvious benefits of Bitcoin. Unfortunately it's a centralized service provided by banks. But it's really taken off and makes monetary transactions as easy as sending a text message. Both for commerce and splitting bar tabs :)
For the above reasons I believe Sweden will never adopt Bitcoin en masse, at least not before the ecosystem grows large enough to provide benefits uncovered by the legacy banking system and their more novel digital experiments.

The point is that instead of buying/selling bitcoins via a company you buy them through other civilian people. So you enter your bank account in order that the person you transact with can put money into your account and you send bitcoins to them. This is more anonymous because instead of buying via an exchange (that stores all your personal information and are a go-to place for authorities) you buy them from one person (who may store and share your personal details, but it's more unlikely and there's no way for the authorities to know of this trade unless one of the participants tell them)

Why don't you believe Ross did it as an act of libertarianism? He spent a significant amount of time writing libertarian rants, we know that he's read some amount of libertarian literature (Mises, Rothbard…). I'm not saying Ross was doing it for purerly altruistic reasons, but I definitely believe he was politically motivated to some extent. I too felt the jolt of history upon learning about the Silk Road and realized the political implications of Bitcoin. It's a historic turn for drug policy in favor of abandoning prohibition. A minor revolution.
Drugs aren't without their downsides, but the war on drugs is a great tragedy of our time. The data overwhelmingly shows that drug prohibition has little or no effect on the overall consumption among a population. We know that adult users rarely have a problematic relationship to drugs. We know that drug abuse is highly contextual. We know that criminalization is extremely destructive and that care actually works. And yet we perpetuate this failed political project that really hasn't accomplished anything it set out to do, but in the mean time put over 1% of the American population behind bars, basically caused societal breakdown in south american nations, ruined hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. Why? We know it's not working, why are we doing this?
(Answer: because it makes people look important and creates jobs in politically influential sectors. No big conspiracy just zero accountability, because voters).

Well, the original proposals (XT and especially Unlimited) were "proper" alternatives (not permanent solutions, but they could buy us some time). I think Classic is an attempt to reach a compromise that miners would support and perhaps just establish a common ground.
To be honest, I think both sides have good points. What I can't understand is the harsh language / conspiracies and more. I'm actually thinking the whole thing is a psy-op orchestrated by govs or banks. I'm not a big fan of conspiracy theories, but there are a lot of users in both camps spreading rumours and provoking unnecessary conflict. There's something really shady about the whole thing

We *have* scaling and the only thing blocking it right now is BU and misinformed and/or lazy miners.
I'm kind of hoping BU forks so that we can activate SegWit and *build stuff*, because we need second layer in order to create services on top of bitcoin.

You can mine in the browser using bcoin! Not sure how efficient is is though, but bcoin has mined it's first block recently.

This is exactly what i want - a web app that basically acts just as a transaction coordinator. It prepares the redeem scripts and provides a graphical interface that makes it easy for users to know the current state of the transaction, yet all transaction signing takes place on the client side.
The missing link for this to work is an easy way for users to share their public key with the website, and also to sign the address using the correct private key (if it's an HD wallet it uses a new private key each time)
Regarding ethereum: i think ethereum is cool, but i think it's a bit excessive. We don't need to reinvent the internet, i think much can be accomplished by just building on the existing web.

The problem isn't the software companies, who are doing the best they can. The problem is intelligence agencies exploiting and destabilising our shared digital infrastructure.

I heard about bitcoin when they were about 8 USD. I was genuinely interested, but i didn't know how to mine or where to buy so the thought slipped my mind.

I think we're talking about different things. I know there are tools that help facilitate multisig address generation between two parties.
What i'm proposing is more a UX/design pattern between a server and a user. The server provides the transactions to be signed by the user using only a QR code, but ultimately the coins still remain in the users control (or both parties, depending on the scheme).
The point is basically that the web app does all the logic and the user only needs to sign. Risk remains distributed, both service providers and users can feel somewhat at ease with this pattern. It also opens up the notion of semi-smart contracts, based only on multisig and a service provider who facilitates multi-step transactions.

Even if blocks would be large enough to hold all the coffee transactions in the world, the 10 minute blocktime wouldn't make it practical for those kinds of purchases. Even with a blocksize increase Bitcoin would not be the scalable money you want, but will at best be a store of value that can be used for mail order purchases. Lightning is a way forward for both scalability, UX and will allow for much needed innovation. I can only beg you to reconsider.

The bottleneck is that all transactions must be fit into blocks, which can't be larger than 1mb. Each block needs to go through the mining process, so when there are a lot of transactions they are put in a queue.
SegWit helps solve this in two ways:
1) Transaction data is made smaller so that more transactions fit into each block. This will increase throughput.
2) The Lightning Network will enable off-chain transactions which makes it possible to send any number of transactions instantly, and then you only need to sync this with the blockchain less often. This will obviously scale the network, but also be a paradigm shift in UX. Bitcoin won't need confirmation time (from a users point of view), will be snappy and cheap to use just like a text message.

But can the attacker not just broadcast his own transaction to the ledger and have it signed? He doesn't need the key then, only be able to communicate with ledger?
(I always need to confirm transactions with a second device or with a keycard, so there is a second factor obviously, but that can be brute forced i'm sure (?))

I think you can say it is "backed" by energy. That doesn't mean that it is redeemable by energy though, so it depends on what you mean with "backed".

It's a second layer protocol to bitcoin that is being developed. It will enable instant transactions, but also solve the problem of scaling. Bitcoin in it's current state can only confirm 1mb of raw transactions about every ten minutes. This means transactions are only finalized every ten minutes-ish, which makes it impractical for casual purchases. The lightning network is an attempt to solve these problems.

Lightning will make smaller transactions perfectly viable. Bitcoin as a store of value really isn't so superior to gold. It's the high mobility/liquidity (ie. a currency) coupled with all the good stuff of gold that makes it novel and interesting.

This is pretty significant. Up until now bitcore seems to have been the only good framework for making bitcoin applications, and to be honest all their tutorials and even some of the documentation is pretty outdated, so it's confusing for people (me) to have to dissect the codebase figuring out how it works. I gave up on my attempt to make my first wallet app after hitting a rock wall of weird network errors at the last important step (broadcasting my transaction)
Frameworks are the road to success, and this one even seems production ready and will bring more javascript developers into the mix. Some people don't like js, but it's the fastest growing language and i think javascript developers are the ones best equipped to integrate bitcoin into the larger internet infrastructure. This is awesome, will dive into it as soon as i have time.

@_date: 2016-11-09 22:45:09
I don't agree. Having early adopters being able to say they actually live off Bitcoin is an important step to prove this is real money. But that means we have to be able to interface with the regular economy.
Being able to save in Bitcoin (and ditch your bank), and transfer daily expenditures to a debit card to buy stuff in the fiat economy, is a pretty good compromise while waiting for crypto singularity :^)

@_date: 2018-06-06 17:33:41
He's a self-described austrian making the point that Bitcoin is an awesome standard *because* it is the hardest money around. You really cherry-picked statements if you came to the conclusion that he's advocating fractional reserve bitcoin banking.
He *does* give an example that many transactions happen off-chain - specifically on exchanges or with third-party trustees (he never mentions LN) - but the point he's making is that on-chain transactions will be mostly for settlement, not for transacting. And he's right.
Luckily we can have off-chain scaling without fractional reserve banking, thanks to this awesome community that demands trustless solutions before death. I'm not worried.

As others have pointed out gold was a decentralized, permissionless store of value prior to Bitcoin. Bitcoin desperately needs real world use cases. All that is on the horizon though. It's more a question of coming up with novel financial services that weren't possible with legacy systems but will be possible with crypto. And design. Crypto needs UX and service design more than it needs more technical features imo.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:09:26
I believe this to be true. I also think UASF helped escalate things to the point where miners had to adopt Segwit, but it wouldn't have happened unless there was a formal compromise in the form of NYA. I upvoted this thread because i think there has to be some post-mortem statements from key actors in this chain of events. But i don't think initially supporting NYA was such a bad thing. I think many of those who signed on to it were just attempting to end the stalemate. That was also accomplished, so i'm quite satisfied with how this played out.

I think Positive Money is a great organisation. I know many gold bugs and bitcoiners disapprove of them because they still want fiat money, only that should be injected into the economy via government spending (they're "only" against fractional reserve banking, not fiat money per se, if i've understood things correctly)
Still, i think they're the only organisation for monetary reform with a wider appeal and it's great that they're spearheading these issues. They seem to be very succesful at it too. I'm not even from the UK and i know about them (kind of interested in the subject matter, but still). All discourse on this matter is good.

I'm going to take this opportunity to voice some thoughts i've been having with regards to cryptographic identity on the web in relation to bitcoin.
A few months ago i heard for the first time about FIDO U2F and UAF. These are next generation authentication protocols that will enable passwordless sign-in on websites using a peripheral device (mobile, usb, whatever). Interestingly UAF uses the same elliptic curve as Bitcoin, so i was thinking maybe you could sign Bitcoin transactions using one of these devices. As i thought some more about it i came to some insights:
- If "cryptographic signing" peripherals become widespread and used for "trustful" applications it would be great for use with crypto currencies.
- The following model is quite interesting: The server provides transactions for users to sign. The user controls the keys and does the signing. The server provides the contract logic and user interface.
- This split makes it easier and less risky for developers to write smart-contract web apps without taking on the risk of storing everyones coins (they don't know the private keys)
- This split makes it less risky for users to use said web apps (only they control the keys)
- The goal is a web experience similar to what the ethereum folks are trying to accomplish with their Mist browser. Basically a bunch of seemingly normal websites which act as a store-front for advanced, multi-step transactions without counter-party risk.
- Unlike ethereum we build upon the existing web stack and use existing browsers, and without running all smart-contracts on the blockchain. As the DAO showed, maybe it's good to have some human in control of most smart-contract. In most cases we want *automated* contracts, not necessarily *autonomous* contracts.
This proposal is probably better implemented with something more bitcoin specific though. I found a BIP draft by Jonas Schnelli (intended for other purposes, but it fits the bill) that could probably be a candidate: 
I've been reaching out to some different people about this but haven't got much of a response. Any thoughts? (I know you're busy Jonas, get back to me when you have the time ;))

Get a hardware wallet. Ledger has one called HW1 which is a good budget wallet. Don't store your coins in a cloud wallet. USB or paper wallet is okay too.
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:33:15
Can you please elaborate on this? I thought inflation was actually worse for the rich, who need to put their money to use as it will only lose it's value if stored for too long. The poorest people don't save and maybe even accumulate debt so i guess they would benefit from inflation? (at best)
Genuinely interested, i would enjoy some recommended reading.

Can't believe this stuff is getting banned. Ethereum isn't just an altcoin, it's a platform for smart contracts and can do a lot of stuff that bitcoin doesn't allow for. It will benefit the crypto economy as a whole. I can really see Bitcoin and Ethereum complement each other. The Ethereum launch is 100x more relevant than Grexit or that some dude bought people a pizza.
Haters shrugging Ethereum off as a pump-and-dump really aren't much different than people calling Bitcoin a pyramid scheme.

No offence, but how would you expect it to be done in any other way? :)
A Bitcoin Wallet is needed, to be able to send and receive bitcoin. If you don't have a means of earning Bitcoin directly, you must buy it at an exchange (same for any currency). I would suggest buying a larger amount, maybe 100USD, so you don't have to buy every month?
If you want it to be as easy as possible i would suggest using blockchain.info's online wallet/exchange. That way you can buy a small amount of moonbucks directly with a credit card, and you can also send it directly to the VPN-provider using the same service, so less steps. Good luck!

@_date: 2017-04-20 06:04:29
This isn't a democracy. The whole point is that Bitcoin should be resistant to change. If it's easy to change the protocol then it's only a matter of time before governments/other interests try to change it to something that suits them better.

Maybe they have a perfect plan with all this (or maybe it's just corporate research, which is fine too) but it's a perfectly valid question to ask, because blockchains come with a cost. They aren't particularly efficient, but they can make P2P networks byzantine fault tolerant. Now accenture has figured out a way to introduce superusers on such a network, but then a perfectly valid question is: is a P2P network really neccessary? Why not a client-server model?

I disagree. Sure, stability is a prerequisite for widespread currency. That doesn't mean it cannot serve as a utility currency for niche markets, the drug trade being one of them.

Comparing apples and oranges. Tails is great, but Ledger can do stuff that Tails cannot. The hardware itself is designed with security in mind, the same is not true of a USB stick. It also comes with conveniences that Tails does not, such as dedicated software, usable from your own OS, etc.
On the other hand, Tails is open source and has more eyeballs to secure it. But it's still on a USB-stick with all that that entails.
Both options should be considered safe.

If addiction was the inevitable outcome of the culture at large everyone would be addicted - well, at least everyone who conformed to the culture (to the extent that they conformed to the culture). That is clearly not the case. Addiction is hereditary to a large extent, but it is also caused by environment variables such as child hood trauma. In short, there are specific factors that highly increase the probability for addiction, and "our society" doesn't seem to be the crucial variable. I think blaming discrete problems on the general culture just blurs the lines of responsibility and obfuscates the concrete problems that can be alleviated by conrete solutions.

First of all, healthy scepticism is a good thing. I'm glad Coindesk accomodates dissenting views.
However, the author fails to explain why Bitcoin mining would centralize over time. I find this very unlikely. It would make sense in a world without mining pools. The largest miner would expect a much steadier stream of revenue, while the small miners would receive block rewards only sporadically.
However, most mining is done via mining pools. Miners pool their hashing power and are rewarded in proportion to the work they contribute. It's pretty much a linear relationship between hashes and expected rewards. What matters is cutting energy costs (and other external costs). Given this reality it will make sense to deploy mining hardware where there is an excess amount of energy being produced - solar, hydro, nuclear and wind. This infrastructure is actually very decentralized.

It's also extremely weird and inappropriate that this guy gets called out for disclosing a Bitcoin vulnerability (that has been addressed) at a conference *about fucking Bitcoin vulnerabilities*. I mean come on!

Of course an open wire for finance can enable new modalitites of value transfer that weren't possible before.
The internet didn't change the information being transfered (at first), only the way it was being transfered. Yet that in turn changed everything.
Go read some Marshall McLuhan :) The medium and it's unique affordances are more transformational than the contents of the message. Bitcoin is unique and transformational. I don't think it will make everything great, but it will certainly change a bunch of stuff.

I've never heard anyone make such a claim. Where have you heard this? There are some who worry about the network gravitating towards a less decentralized topology than would be ideal. I think that may be the case, but those incentives will also suggest that the network should gravitate towards full connectivity. So perhaps we will see some nodes that are more connected than others, but only because it gives better connectivity. So censorship will likely not be feasible, especially since all payments are onion routed.
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:12:28
Depends on the definition of "the whole world falling apart". Sure, if you mean literal, global catastrophe making life impossible, bitcoin wouldn't survive that. But bitcoin would not only survive, but thrive in a crisis at the human level. You need networked computers, for sure. But that is also one of the more resilient infrastructures. Keep in mind that the internet was designed to withstand nuclear warfare.

You have a real point. With the price of Bitcoin rising i'm reluctant to spend coins, even though i have a card that allows me to do it easily - although, i have bought drugs with Bitcoin on a number of occasions, prior to any real interest in crypto. It was when doing so that i came to realise what a promising medium of exchange this is.
Bitcoins primary value proposition is that it lends itself to use-cases that can't be done with existing infrastructure. Black markets are one use case, poorer economies without access to the existing financial system (a huge part of the world) is another potential use case. But i think the greatest growth potential of bitcoin is the promise of an "open wire" for finance, similar to what the world-wide web is for content. This allows for rapid, permissionless innovation without the overhead of starting a bank.
It may be that actual apps will primarily use Bitcoin as an intermediary token to move fiat, avoiding leaving users vulnerable to volatility. And that's okay. This use case alone provides a base layer of value and use for Bitcoin. In time, as price stabilises, more and more people will find good reasons to hold some Bitcoin and a new speculative growth cycle starts. This will probably happen a dozen times more until Bitcoin becomes as normal as stocks and gold.
But there's always a risk China bans Bitcoin.

I think you're in for disappointment. In part because your post reads like it's been generated from feeding an AI wired headlines, but also because disruption isn't just smooth sailing towards wonder and ease. Remember that the industrial revolution didn't just bring about material abundance, but also the obliteration of pre-existing social structures, machine powered warfare, regimentation of man into industry and totalitarian states.
All that being said, i also think we're on a trajectory towards a brighter future, but it is going to be a bumpy ride with a lot of detours. And VR will probably not be a huge part of it.

The fentanyl epidemic is the result of drug policy. Only in illegal markets do such a dangerous idea as fentanyl make sense.

Every piece of software was vaporware at some time, people said those things about ethereum too. Also, this seems very formalized mathematically already, the white paper is quite comprehensive. So it's not even total vaporware  (unlike most of ethereum projects so far). I don't know what point you're trying to make. There are certain design decisions in Solidity that are clearly lacking. I don't think that means Solidity is all-together trash, it was the first language that acheived some cypherpunk pipe dreams such as DAO (although i think the EVM is the real innovation, not Solidity). That's cool and all. Now let's learn what worked and what didn't and make more stuff. All boats rise.

I'm not even sure it will depreciate. There will be parallell growth of all kinds of usage. There is a synergy effect the more kinds of usage that are supported. We use the web for WWW, E-mail, Youtube, Facebook. We use it in our work, and we use it to chill out after work. I hope to see a similar plethora of services grow on top of Bitcoin and interconnected chains.
And with regards to E-mail/WWW/IRC/??? vs Youtube/Facebook/etc i don't think it was a zero sum game, the decentralized web just could never have grown the same way the centralised web did. And i say that as someone who's very pro decentralization and don't like what social media/web 2.0 became. Still, i think it was 100% key to the growth of the internet, and i hope the future will become more decentralized than it has been thus far (although i'm not holding my breath)

Since it would have to be done via hard fork i just think people will gravitate back to the legacy chain. It would be the same situation as with all hard forks. It's just better to create a new chain from scratch.
I'm somewhat sympathetic with the sentiment. But it's also a bitch move against lots of people who have put money and resources into Bitcoin. Most miners are decent and care about Bitcoin.

The emergence of centralised infrastructure is bound to happen as crypto matures. I don't  see it as a dichotomy between centralised services and "raw" protocol usage. Just like with the internet, we will see a range of services offering different degrees of sovereignty/ease of use. I think W-Pay looks very good for being a more traditional payment rail.

You don't need to mine to just run a full node! I personally run a bitcore node, which is a full node that verifies transactions but also stores the blockchain in a database which makes it faster and easier to build stuff that's actually usable. The downside is this requires a lot of ram and hdd, so a raspberry pi won't do. But i'm kind of sceptical about running a regular fullnode on a raspberry pi too, but it's probably possible (think i've seen a few posts about it)

Google "CEO", or maybe compare it to experiences you may have? CEOs manage the company and make things happen. Lightning Labs have seven employees, that's larger than the tech start-up i work at and we have two people working with management and external communication, in addition the CEO. Why are you presuming she doesn't do anything? Steve Jobs is hailed as a fucking saint and never wrote a line of code, but he was great at "playing the orchestra".
Personally, i think the glorification of good developers in this community is somewhat overblown. It takes a lot of people with different skillsets to make a good product. A good designer or a crypto-savvy executive making sure people is working in tandem are equally important, and i'd even say there's a lack of the latter in this industry compared with the former.

Yes, the benefits of transferring money across borders using Bitcoin are definetly very real. It can feel a bit complicated at first, but once you've tried it once it it should feel pretty easy. Definetly cheaper and probably less hassle once you get used to it.
There are four basic steps for you:
1) Aquire Bitcoin. This can be done in several ways, but usually via a Bitcoin Exchange, a Bitcoin ATM or purchase directly from a person who offers to sell it to you. In which country do you live, if i may ask? I'll try to list the options.
2) Upon purchase you should transfer the bitcoins to a wallet software on your computer or phone. I recommend Electrum for computer.
3) From your wallet, send the bitcoins to your friend across the border (obviously that person also needs to download a wallet app to receive the coins)
4) Your friend can then exchange the coins for their local currency. Again, this can be done at an online exchange or selling them directly to an individual for cash. The options will vary depending on the country.

A confirmation is when the transaction is included in a block, which is accomplished when a miner manages to hash the pending transaction with a sufficient amount of leading zeroes (this is the mining process).
Non-mining full nodes don't hash, but they still help propagate transactions. They are also the gateway to the network for any application. Many wallets are only clients that send transactions to dedicated full-nodes, who in turn send them to the network.

I'd also like to see more discussion regarding the political implications of bitcoin, it's way more interesting than the mere technological aspects. Bitcoin has already disrupted the drug trade, one of the largest markets in the world! As a recreational drug user, for me bitcoin has already made a huge impact on a small part of my life. Much like bittorrent did back in ~2004 for my media consumption.
Of course, disrupting the banking industry will be even more interesting. Looking forward to that :)

I'm actually not all that convinced of the value of this. I was quite hyped over ethereum in the early days, but the whole DAO situation actually made me doubt if smart-contracts on a blockchain is such a good idea. Sure, there are some interesting use cases. But if a contract has an exploit it's basically unfixable. For most use cases we want "pseudo smart contracts" - programmable money but with some human custodian still in charge when shit hits the fan. We can get that using only multi-sig, we don't need to put the whole contract logic on a blockchain.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:40:33

It will become easier with the emergence of better UX and, more importantly imo, new design conventions/paradigms.
I think hardware wallets will be used for longer/safer storage and mobile apps/webapps will be used as a more fast paced transactions. I think solving the problem of counter-party risk on webapps will be a thing. Basically signing transactions on the client side, the web app only providing the logic and UI for the service.
In short, it will get there but it's kind of a new paradigm. These things take time to emerge.

How many here with strong opinions are actually developing stuff? I've tried building stuff with both bitcoin and ethereum, and i find both the ethereum toolchain (although in it's infancy) and the developer community to be far ahead of bitcoin. However, bitcoin is very attractive as a payment network. I also think rootstock aren't really aiming for the same goal. Ethereum is a much more ambitious project that really aims to integrate cryptographic identity into the web milieu, with stuff like web3 and the mist browser.
Finally, I want to say that all this animosity only reflects on one's emotional attachments, likely based on how invested you are economically. In the end I think both BTC/ETH will find their place - bitcoin as a payment network and store of value, ethereum as a platform to build a certain kind of applications.

Some addresses are inherently invalid, in the mathematical sense that there cannot exist a private key that unlocks that particular range of addresses. But in other case, you're absolutely correct: there's nothing that distinguishes an address which is 'owned' from one that isn't 'owned' (but the mathematical possibility of 'owning' it exists (knowing the private key))
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:27:59
So it's not possible? I think I made a pretty good explanation for a case where it would be desirable to top up your payment channel.
On LN this wouldn't be an issue really, but for a normal one-way payment channel it might be cumbersome to have to set up a new one. Since a payment channel is basically just a multi-sig address, why can't i top it up?

It's not entirely unproblematic, I'll give you that.
But drug criminalization is an ongoing atrocity (i really mean that - we'll look back on this period like we did laws against homosexuality and locking up people with neuropsychiatric conditions) and DNMs is the "brown paper bag" that actually fixes a lot of the bad stuff related to the supply side of things, and also doesn't worsen stuff on the consumer side much.
We desperately need to learn to live with drugs in our societies, and I think DNMs is a step towards that in some respects.

I've been watching this project, among others, for some time now. I'm so happy OB, Ethereum, Multi-sig and other developments on the crypto currency scene have finally come to fruition. I think OB will be a big deal, although mostly as a platform for others to build upon. The killer app for mainstream adoption is still years down the road though, i think.

The idea itself is very promising, but what's going on now is extremely problematic. If you wouldn't spend dollars on a business, don't spend crypto on it either. Many of these ideas are crap, the teams seldom have an MVP to show, it's often unclear what's is the point of the token being sold, and the dApp-market cap gets inflated because only a few tokens are on sale while the creators keep the lion part of the tokens off the market. It's a bubble. But the idea is promising.

What's the bad news? Segwit is looking to become a reality very soon, enabling scaling through LN and other super cool stuff that will enable second layer innovations. Sidechains will be fucking awesome.
More importantly, we might actually stop fighting about scaling and instead be more constructive with our time on reddit. I'm looking forward to that.
I also think the SEC having it's eyes on Ethereum and on ICOs had en effect into the price.

Fentanyl only exists because of the legal arms race that has rendered competing opiates - tradional, safer opiates - uncompetitive.
The same can be said for synthetic cannabinoids that emulate a relatively harmless drug (cannabis). The first generation of synthetic cannabinoids weren't that bad, neither was the 2nd and 3rd. The later ones were really bad, and would never have existed, if it was not for the terribly short-sighted idiots trying to outlaw normal human behavior.
We need to accept drugs in our societies and learn to cope instead of trying to ban it.

Quoted from [this link](


Now, I agree that securing the bitcoin ecosystem is worth a great deal, considering the immense value and utility of crypto-currency. But if the price of Bitcoin approaches 1 million (and let's hope it does ;)))))) it's a huge energy cost. But yeah, compared to the amount of energy wasted on &lt;insert anything&gt; Bitcoin actually does promise real value to the world.
Also I really can't imagine bitcoin ever hitting 1 million.
Don't know if these predictions take halving into consideration either.

Extension blocks aren't a bad idea. The timing is bad.
But to be honest i think extension blocls may be the solution that finally gets adopted as a compromise. If the recent Bitmain revelations don't bring about 95% Segwit i don't know what will. All pools except Antpool are basically supporting Segwit. Yes?  I don't see any other way forward except UASF and extension blocks. Fingers crossed for Segwit though.

I think that's where I stand too. I think a compromise still is the way to go if possible. If I'm not mistaken many core developers have also expressed concerns regarding UASF.
The UASF spam going on here is actually pretty disturbing, I don't get the impressions that these people know what they're advocating. To be honest *I don't know* what I feel about UASF, but the tone of these posts aren't helping! Let's not succumb to heard mentality.

Bitcoin's "inability" to reach consensus is a feature, not a bug. Having different groups competing for influence is actually a proof that Bitcoin cannot be easily swayed by a single party. These other coins may be able to move quicker, but their governance is centralized. That ultimately puts them closer to PayPal than Bitcoin.

Sidechains will allow rapid innovation on the Bitcoin protocol without having to do cumbersome and potentially dangerous changes to said main chain - let alone reach consensus on the changes, which is becoming increasingly impossible.
The same pool of money will flow in and out of sandboxed chains that can offer specific benefits not possible on the main chain. Some will offer safety mechanisms that prevent theft, others may offer smart-contracts, another may be a custom, permissioned internal infrastructure for some big corporation. If enough people prefer one sidechain over the Bitcoin main chain that could be considered the new main chain for all pratical purposes - enabling opt-in updates that don't require community consensus.
The fact that we can innovate without reaching consensus on every change is revolutionary. It's the most exciting and promising thing happening in crypto right now.

Some would argue that wealth distribution is an equally valid and pragmatic approach to counter-balancing the historical (and ongoing) wrongdoings that skew wealth concentration in one way or other.

It's one of those things that's very situational. You don't care about it until you do, and then you get super frustrated.
But from a UX point of view, i think even a 10 minute confirmation time sucks and rules out many use cases. Even the normal confirmation time is a major weakness, so Lightning is a great way forward imo.

Not all leftists propose an appropriation of the means of production. But those who do aren't necessarily saying that appropriation by the masses is *always* ethical, only under certain circumstances.
Much of the world's wealth wasn't exactly obtained according to the non-aggression principle or other libertarian ideals. In fact, much of the world's wealth concentration can still be traced back to the ages of slavery, imperialism, land grabs, even feudalism. One can argue that redistributing some of this wealth is just invoking NAP/property rights.

To be honest i think the whole smart-contracts deployed on the blockchain is a niché product at best. I can certainly see some interesting applications, but it's way overhyped. Most things don't get better because they're done in such a way. But time will tell.

That's not a very helpful analogy. Advocating for big blocks isn't a false truth claim, it's simply a design choice with some trade-offs: reduced decentralization in exchange for a modest increase in transaction throughput on-chain. There's also the meta-conflict which isn't about engineering at all: who gets to make these design decisions? The latter is what this conflict is really about at the end of the day.

Oldie but goldie?
I have a question though: let's say Alice, Bob, Charlie and David all have payment channels with Zorro's Payment Routing Inc. They can all send one way payments *via* Zorro's to any third-party that Zorro's has a payment channel with, using hashlocks to make sure Zorro doesn't steal funds in transit. So far i've basically sketched out a rudimentary, one way LN *i think* (correct me if i'm wrong)
However, the third parties all use different pre-images and thus different hashlocks. Does Alice, Bob, Charlie and David all need to create a new payment channel with Zorro's for each third-party, or do they only have one payment channel and create separate outputs with different hashlocks?
In the first case they need to lock up new funds for each separate channel, which isn't ideal.
In the second case, Zorro's needs to pay four separate transaction fees to settle A, B, C and Ds payment channels to the blockchain, while the third party only needs to pay one fee to settle with Zorro's.
Is there a way to keep a roughly 1-to-1 settlement fee for all nodes in a LN? Maybe i just haven't understood it correctly.

We're all born into structures that we have no control over.

I don't agree. There are different interest-groups competing for influence over the protocol. This power dynamic is a good thing that protects the network. The stalemate has been a demonstration of Bitcoins resilience in many ways.
If a compromise is needed in order to bring about an update, that just means no single party succeeded in forcing their vision onto the network in face of opposition. I'd prefer 1MB Segwit, but i've actually come to appreciate the political process as an important dynamic that protects the network.

I definitely have a crypto obsession that isn't always healthy. I have my episodes when it just becomes too much, i try to cut down on it.
I have an earnest interest in it though, both technically and politically. It just feels cool to first anticipate and then witness a tectonic shift as this. I think it's okay to be a bit obsessed, just try to remember what's important in life too.

If Bitcoin was centralized we would have reached consensus on scaling a long time ago

It would be a mistake to reduce all leftists to statists. There are lots of leftists who advocate free markets and no wealth-distribution, but would prefer other modes of ownership when it comes to *production*. It's also worth remembering that the limited liability corporation is a state-sanctioned form of ownership that was invented as late as 1855.

The problem is that difficulty readjustment takes longer time with less mining :) it's based on block count, not time. But i'm pretty confident most miners will stick with core though.

The best value proposition is the "internet of value"-one. Bitcoin enables monetary transactions embedded easily into any app or website. Looking at crypto currencies from a wider perspective: side-chains and other blockchains enable smart-contracts/programmable money. This opens the door to a fully automated economy. More importantly, it brings the same amount of innovation and creativity to the economic/financial realm as we've seen for the communication/media/information based realm (thanks to the internet)

Regulatory crackdown could make the price drop obviously, although i don't think it would go anywhere near zero.
If someone breaks elliptic curve cryptography, that would obviously be a crises of sorts (although the legacy financial infrastructure would likely be equally exposed).
Or if another currency overtakes Bitcoin. I don't think it will be ethereum, but maybe some government backed currency in combination with an overall crackdown on unregulated currencies.
