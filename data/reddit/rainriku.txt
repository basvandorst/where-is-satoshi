Bitcoin is a 'bubble', might be the most genius statement I've have ever heard from my friend's 'technical analysis' who doesn't even know what bitcoin is. :)
And yes, I'm also the good at sarcasm
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:55:39
For the traders who sold their BTC on the last dip..may you walk on the field of reeds!!

It's a screenshot of BitFlyer website from my desktop.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:54:18
I probably would. The prices of the hardware wallet here is japan is a bit expensive. Can the language be easily change if the default one is japanese?
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:49:13
I actually have no idea how to use it. Will it be more risky?
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:05:38
As of now bitflyer supports BTC,ETH,ETC,LTC,BCH.
