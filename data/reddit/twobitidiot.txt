Pretty much impossible not to rise up when the government could potentially impose capital controls, which are immoral and should be *absolutely* fought in a civilly disobedient way.  The bitcoin molotov cocktail is appropriate in this context.  Not as a call to violence, but as a call to peaceful individual resistance via technology.

Totally agree. Bitcoin is going to have a tough time getting treated as a currency vs. commodity.  The future still looks like it will be in fiat - resting atop the Bitcoin protocol.

The reporter from the Times also called me with a sick desperation in her voice yesterday clearly frustrated that she couldn't get the same sources.  I would have worked with her but for the disgusting lack of objectivity she exhibited on the phone.

Could not agree with this more.  Congressmen only really cares about one thing: reelection.  And we need to scare them into understanding that overregulation will make the US less competitive long-term (Bitcoin businesses going overseas) and generate less taxes (Bitcoin's promotion and appreciation is a good thing).  
The question they should be left with is this: Do you want to be the congressman that didn't protect the new "internet of money"?

That's because it's non-news, news.  If it were big, I would have teased people while I wrote the full story myself.  :)  
Little recognized blurb that only made it to "politicopro", so not sure how many people would catch it.  I just think it's interesting that the industry collectively has still not hired a lobbyist, and that the first one in town is working with MC.  
I don't MC wants to explicitly bash bitcoin, because they don't have to.  All they have to do is implicitly threaten its viability by demanding that bitcoin entities comply with the same consumer protection / AML / KYC / BSA requirements as other fxl firms - making bitcoin just as expensive.

James and I have discussed this topic a bunch (we're both in Cambridge).  I also wrote a blog post on the subject:
I think the only 51% attack to fear would come from a sovereignty who felt that bitcoin threatened its reserve currency status.  In reality, there doesn't seem to be any real solution to this, so I think the community appropriately focuses on the problems that it *can* solve.  
The hope seems to be that btc stays off governments' radar as a true threat to their control of their monetary bases for a long enough period of time until it has already become too big to fail.  
In reality, the 51% is just one way a sovereignty could harm bitcoin.  Outlawing it or making it prohibitively difficult for people to use, would do just as much damage.  Either way, the fears of a 51% attack have to just be baked into bitcoin's failure probability, which is still high.

Circle’s Blog Post: 
My review:
Oh baby, baby.  All I have to say about Circle’s official public launch is that it is worth the wait.  
The company is launching its site to the masses and internationally today, available in English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese - enough to initially cover 40% of the global population.  Its account balances will render in over 160 different currencies, responsive to the individual user’s IP address, and the same deposit and withdrawal limits will apply for all new users.  Circle will slash or eliminate its $10 sign-up bonus, but that is AOK to me given the company’s continued commitment to fee-less transactions.  
For a sizable portion of the Bitcoin early adopter crowd, Circle won’t feel like bitcoin, it will feel like banking 2.0.
Although anyone will be able to open an account with an email address and phone number, Circle’s international users won’t be able to connect bank accounts just yet.  They will, however, be able to deposit money for a small fee from any Visa or Mastercard card.  Perhaps more importantly, users will be able to send bitcoin to new email addresses or user anywhere in the world via the company’s beautiful, confidence-inspiring web wallet.  Circle seems content to launch internationally and on-board early adopters before unveiling formal banking partnerships — an intriguing strategy.  The second that Circle signs a deal with a bank in Latin America or Africa or Southeast Asia, free international remittances could actually become a reality.
The company’s mobile wallets are also “imminent,” and I was shown both the Android and iOS apps during my visit to the company’s rapidly growing office in Boston.  The Android app will be full-featured from Day 1, while the iOS app will not allow deposits or withdrawals due to the App Store’s policies.  
CEO Jeremy Allaire was characteristically tightlipped about specifics regarding his company’s underwriters (“they are highly rated”), banking partners (“we have a great US partner; not ready to talk about international banks yet”), future products (“we are focused on this initial roll-out”) and KYC/AML policies (“we’ve spent a lot of time on this during the beta”).  Others will have more to say about the launch, but since I can’t get any proprietary intel out of the team, I won’t drone on.  
Suffice it to say, I think they are continuing to knock it out of the park with their early products.  Circle has been stress testing its site for months in anticipation of its broader public launch.  We’ll see how it holds up as its user base explodes from low five figures into (probably) the six figures this week.  
If this can’t spark a rally, I don’t know what can.

Well super technically, the US already has already created an ungodly amount of inflation since "inflation" really just has to do with the expansion of the money supply; rising prices are just the usual result of inflation. It might not happen immediately, but if you look at asset / commodity prices (i.e. things we need) that's where people are really feeling the pain.  
Point taken though, it has a lot to do with stagnant wages as well.

True, but I don't think the government would go for that, because it would be very difficult to levy taxes and you'd get a ton of people saying "I lost my bitcoin!" to get credit, and then "finding" it without paying taxes years later.  
Or if you claimed they were lost and someone else found the private keys, you'd be on the hook for tax penalties for stolen coins?  Seems very unlikely, unless you have insurance on those coins.

Not to rain on the parade, but Uber just did a huge deal with American Express in which Kalanick said: "I am not happy until 100 percent of Uber users are using AmEx to get around their city."

This is a 4,500 word tax guide. So here's the TL:DR; 
1) Bitcoin will be treated like property, which means all gains are taxable, while losses you can claim are capped at $3,000 per year. 
2) Fair market value and cost basis are often difficult or impossible to determine precisely given spreads in bitcoin's market value between exchanges and intraday price swings. The key is to compute fair-market value "in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.
3) Any alt-currencies that may be converted via an exchange to fiat or are demonstrably valuable in commerce are taxable "convertible virtual currencies".
4) Calculating cost basis gets particularly confusing because it is nearly impossible to specifically ID which "lots" of bitcoin you mean to sell or use when making a purchase.  Many bitcoiners will be at the mercy of Coinbase et al's subaccounting.
5) Wash sales (selling bitcoin to realize a tax loss only to buy it right back) do not apply to bitcoin, and it would take an act of Congress to make this type of trading illegal.  
6) Yes, every single cup of coffee you buy in the US will likely create a taxable event.  No exaggeration, and no exemption for small transactions.
7) Simple donations may create a tax nightmare.  Read this section of the article in its entirety if you are making donations.
8) Recipients of tips and gifts must pay taxes on 100% of their gifts unless they know the cost basis of the bitcoins that were given to them. 
9) If you lost money in Mt. Gox, but had capital gains in your Gox account, you'll need to pay capital gains taxes for 2013, and won't be able to write off your losses until next year.

Said another way, if you keep selling your first-in under FIFO, you are liquidating your oldest positions and making it harder to get to a &gt;12 month holding period.  LIFO is going to give you lower spreads for ordinary gains losses given the rapid growth, and bigger spreads on the longest duration "lots" of BTC, which will help many people realize more capital gains.

Only way institutions can amass big positions without sending the price through the roof is to do private placements.  Expect an auction with more buyers than sellers...because auctioning the coins legally would be a signal that bitcoins are aok.  (You're spot on.)

Jerry - My company Inscrypto works on 4b.  We are creating a privately funded, decentralized "FDIC" for bitcoin that helps consumers eliminate their price volatility exposure.  We do that by getting pro investors to guarantee the underlying USD value of bitcoin and invest in the volatile financial asset.

Thanks for the support!  I sold my bitcoins because I don't know when I'll be able to trade again for legal reasons.  Holding and not being able to trade would have rendered me insolvent.  I'm glad that they price has rebounded (rather quickly) above where I sold out.

LIFO by definition is going to give you the shortest duration for any sold positions, so yes, highest probability that you get hit with ordinary income rates under LIFO, but when you talk about Bitcoin, you are generally talking to people who trade/transact more frequently and have seen massive run-up in price.  Odds are that many who did some "profit-taking" in 2013 did so with at least some BTC purchased &lt;12 months prior to sale.  FIFO is only good if the first-in positions are more than one year old.  For Coinbase customers that will be the exception rather than the rule given they started in late 2012.

"[We] proactively reached out to the Southern District of New York to offer assistance…We are continuing to help them and we are cooperating fully with their investigation.”
The Foundation and its representatives should be applauded for this transparency, fast action and professionalism.  This statement and its corresponding actions are in the best interest of the industry.  
Earlier today, I asked for comment from the Bitcoin Foundation and got this much less specific reply:
"This is certainly not the end of Bitcoin. Perhaps the end of one chapter, but certainly not the end. As our industry matures, we are seeing a second wave of capable, responsible entrepreneurs and investors who are building reliable services for this ecosystem."
Anyone still think it was unfair for me to publicly pressure the Bitcoin Foundation representatives for comment?

Bruce, I'm a finance guy, too. And share your thoughts exactly.
Two Q's: 
1) Amongst your WS colleagues and friends, what is the split **today** of pros who say: "What is Bitcoin?", "Bitcoin is worthless", "Bitcoin is interesting tech, but questionable currency &amp; bubble", and "Bitcoin is going to be the internet of money: what's our strategy."     
2) Any interest in helping my company Inscrypto create a privately funded, decentralized FDIC for Bitcoin?  We're working with bullish professional investors to be the guarantors of the underlying USD value of consumers' bitcoin.  Kill price volatility for consumers, help investors essentially trade bitcoin on margin without holding digital currency, and provide stability to the overall market.

All will be revealed as soon as legally possible. I understand your skepticism.  I believe the BTC Foundation when it puts out a statement to Bloomberg, and I believe Roger when he issues a statement to me (last entry in my blog before this story).  If anyone lied to me and conspired to commit fraud, they are probably going to jail.  So it won't really matter if they were able to put one over on me. 
I stand behind the executives at these three organizations based on all that I have learned, and people on this forum should be ecstatic at their quick professional response as well.

You're right, the fact that there is no common sense exemption threshold is a brutal blow to bitcoin's development.  But that might be out of the IRS's hands, because it would take an act of Congress to create such an exemption.  
@_date: 2014-04-29 10:23:29
I very much doubt this to be true, as the IRS really only had two options: tax bitcoin as currency (much worse) or as commodity.  The IRS can't make up tax law, only interpret existing statutes, so they had no liberties to pick and choose which parts of the code to apply to btc.

Biggest contribution I can make is on 3a, examples for business cases and industries in which Bitcoin could have a profound impact: 
1) Digital content: Bitcoin facilitates pay-per-view micro-transactions for digital content such as news articles, blogs or online videos that were otherwise cost prohibitive to date. 
2) Charitable giving: Charities are under constant pressure to "reduce overhead" and yet very often 2-3% of their overhead comes from credit card fees, which bitcoin largely eliminates.
3) Real-time remittances: How can an international worker send money home to support his family for free? How can a mom send money to her children in college in real time? How can friends split a tab at dinner? As "digital cash," Bitcoin can allow for real-time transfers of money.

My company  let's people pick their own price exposure, so they don't necessarily need to insure 100%. i.e. if they "insure" 90%, they will recover 90 cents on the dollar if Bitcoin goes to zero.  If it goes up 10x, they are still happy because they've doubled their money.  Not bad for what is essentially a checking account.

Bruce is a professional investor who claims to have discussed a potential deal with Mt. Gox starting 2-3 weeks ago.  And yet it appears that he never once asked for a balance sheet. 
Let me tell you folks: that just does not happen. Not with a banana stand, and certainly not with a multinational currency exchange. 
Bruce claims he wanted to "install a real team, immediately settle the lawsuits and immediately go on a road show communicating with customers about the exact status of their accounts."  But he never states what that status was. 
He further claims that he agreed in principle to save Gox with another major Bitcoin player, and asked Mark to give "more clarity to customers" after the crisis strategy draft leaked. 
But then Bruce pawns off on Charlie Shrem the fact that "it did not seem at all that Gox had lost the coins." He fails to acknowledge whether he himself actually diligenced the opportunity and Gox's balance sheet.  Furthermore he is ambiguous when he states: "Surely they didn't think an investor would cover the coin losses," which is a dodge of the question: would an investor bail-out Gox according to the terms in the Crisis Strategy Draft: as a fractional reserve. 
People: if I'm a professional investor posting about my investment conversations with a criminally negligent prospect, I'm not giving the long-winded, dodgy explanation that Fenton just did. I'm emphatically denying that I had knowledge of the company's problem and unequivocally denouncing the company that pulled the wool over my eyes during diligence. 
Read Bruce's entry carefully.  
He never once states that he didn't know about Mt. Gox's cold storage losses.  He says that his team would never have bailed out Gox's "total" lost reserves but says nothing about whether he would have bailed out the company as a fractional reserve as outlined in the Crisis Strategy doc.

On the other hand, the whole fiasco does show that "decentralization" is, has been, and will be a myth for Bitcoin.  I would love to see Amazon and Google (not to mention central governments) throw power behind mining, if for no other reason than that they have the resources to counter the guilds.  That's blasphemy on this sub, but it's bound to happen.  Big argument for proof of stake mining.

Only objection I have to your analysis (which is excellent) is that the $150mm raised is necessarily equal to the BDD from last week.  I don't doubt that the two are one and the same, but most likely that Fortress raised the USD independently and this was one of the first purchases.  
Also likely (since this is a private placement with lots of reg boogers to work through) that the price was agreed to some time ago and the bitcoins were transferred when the final docs were signed.  
I'd bet Fortress still has dry powder in USD or there were additional purchases in other blocks over the past few weeks.  The one from 10 days ago was probably just the largest.

No, I didn't forget velocity.  I merely omitted it to stay simple.  Velocity will play a part in determining what Bitcoin's ultimate monetary base looks like - so it's a variable in a more complex theoretical formula, same with the other variables.  But a 10% change in the mining rates or lost coin assumptions will have next to no impact on fair market value calcs compared to a 10% change in your hurdle rate.   
The necessary long-term monetary base needed to support bitcoin commerce is probably smaller than what we would need in the dollar-driven reserve system because of faster velocity.  
This is a back of the envelope calc, dude.  Just to show that it's not rocket science. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:19:23
Today we plan to hold 100% of the cash value of BTC in reserve.  At today's Bitcoin market cap, it would only take ~$50mm to insure all *non-speculative* US consumer deposits under $10k.  We could likely extend that for larger merchants as well.  In the event of a flash crash, there isn't likely to be any panic selling from insured customers, because their USD value stays constant.  For the investors, that means their losses are unrealized.

ooooooh!  This is very interesting.  I've been trying to wrap my head around what the IRS tax policy will be and this will be a good one.  Thanks for posting.  Normally, you are covered can write off certain losses from theft, loss, or damage if they are insured (Bitcoin doesn't have an insurance market yet), or if they lose value (i.e. a trading loss).  
My guess is that you won't be able to write this off because like cash, it might be impossible to prove that you truly lost it.  
This is one of the reasons I started  which seeks to insure people's crypto-currencies.

Couple comments here...
1) Thank you for nominating me for a board seat at this fictitious organization!  I'm flattered, although I'm probably too controversial. :)
2) Andreas has said multiple times that he has no intention of sitting on the board of a centralized org that purports to represent the entire Bitcoin community.  
3) When it comes to advocacy with respect to lobbying governments, DATA has stepped up in a big way (the Digital Asset Transfer Authority).  TBF should be relegated to paying the core devs and doing some light educational work. 
4) When it comes to real advocacy and education, I believe a student group I'm working with, College Cryptocurrency Network, will take the lead on educating new bitcoiners and being vastly superior advocates than the Bitcoin Foundation has ever been. 
5) The "accusations" against Brock seem overblown, but it presents a degree of headline risk to the Foundation for the next reporter trying to craft a narrative of how broken that "representative" org is.  I also think the Lee brothers are high-integrity guys, so I'd shy away from accusing them of market manipuation.  
6) The accusations of Tony G being a "pedophile" are completely 100% ridiculous, infinitely more ridiculous than those against Brock.  Tony ran a photography business and happened to have clients ranging from models to kids whose parents paid to have pictures taken at the beach.  The audacity!  
I think the Bitcoin Foundation has been hopelessly inept at the executive levels, which is too bad because a lot of good people in the industry work with them.  But I'm withholding judgment on the new board for a while given their legitimate business experience.

This is also a possibility, but seems less likely given that if this were the strategy, Coinbase would definitely NOT make anything even resembling an endorsement of a third-party developer's product.  This is where bitcoin's irreversibility becomes a bit of a problem...

The thinking is there, the early adopter street cred is there, the media attention is there.

In the case of an instant transaction where Wikipedia doesn't set up a merchant account, then yes.  But one of our patents is a method patent for "pulling through" new charities to accept Bitcoin and direct convert to cash without necessarily setting up a merchant account.  
Donors can also donate bitcoins into micro-foundations, get the write off for the FMV at the time of the donation, and keep the funds invested in bitcoins over the long-run (vs. investing in mutual funds via a donor-advised fund at Fidelity)

Remember they added lots of customers towards the end of the year.  If they bought in Nov/Dec and used any BTC since then, their biggest losses will be recognized using FIFO (giving them bigger tax write-offs).  That said, the issue is long-term.  People won't be able to switch back and forth from LIFO to FIFO year-to-year without opening themselves up to liability during an audit. IRS looks for people to track cost basis in a "reasonable manner which is consistently applied." Only way to save yourself the tax headache is to use tax-optimizing software (probably from a third party) that hasn't been built yet.

I don't think people realize what a big fucking deal this is.  Basically, the way bitcoin tax works is if you hold for longer than a year and sell or spend bitcoin that has appreciated, then you incur a capital gain.  
For early adopters, who are sitting on big positions they haven't sold (and big capital gains), Fido Charitable let's them donate the appreciated bitcoin, take the full tax writeoff for the current value of that bitcoin AND avoid the cap gains tax.  
DAFs are awesome tax efficient vehicles that you can give from over many years, to basically any charity that is registered with the IRS.  Like mini-private foundations. 
This is going to be a really big deal in 2016 if we see a significant rally in the bitcoin price going into halving.

We plan to set a low cap at first (maybe $10k USD) in order to encourage consumers who wish to benefit from Bitcoin the payment network.  We aren't catering to speculators.  
It is a "no gains no fees" model.  Future revenue streams are possible, but we don't plan to hit the consumer.  They get downside protection and upside potential, but "pay" in the sense that portions of gains are captured by hedge funds and in turn BDIC.

Guys - This is all game theory.  It makes total sense if you realize three things:
1) Politicians only care about reelection.  Do you want to be a pol who over-regulated the internet and let the next major tech revolution occur entirely overseas?
2) Appropriate regs will make it easier for innovators while tackling the bigger issue of security.  Regulated companies like Coinbase / Circle and their ID verification tools will comply with AML and other regs and push mainstream adoption. 
3) It is impossible to stop bitcoin as a global currency.  Pols have nothing to gain by trying to cut the head off of the hydra.  All that will happen is a dramatic financial services power shift to non-U.S. nations.

I think you are overestimating the average consumer's / merchant's interest in controlling their own private keys.  I for one like the fact that CB puts most of my BTC in "cold storage" and literally secures it at brick and mortar banks.  Don't trust hard-drive crashes / USBs / etc.  Besides that, they also allow you to print out and store BTC yourselves if you want to. That's why I'll continue to use them.  I trust them. 
And just like with a big bank, trust = brand = sticky customers.  People aren't going to start hiding BTC sticks of USB under their mattresses (or the personal digital equivalent) just because they aren't holding cold hard cash anymore.  
CoinBase the digital currency "superbank" is tremendously valuable so I flat-out disagree with you.  
CoinValidation will be fine in America and probably internationally.  We're pretty used to being followed by the NSA, so if you aren't doing anything shady, what's there to hide?  Not saying I agree with our surveillance state, but that's the way it is. 
Besides, how else are you going to comply with AML and KYC laws?
On the developer library, there were a lot of Google shareholders going ballistic when they decided to leave Android as a free platform.  They're doing pretty well.
I'm interested in hearing someone from CoinBase respond to this...maybe if we get to the top of the subreddit?  haha

Not sure why miners would lose interest as long-term they still collect transaction fees for processing blocks.  So the thesis is that the currency goes mainstream and greater transaction fees offset the lower mining rewards (which in USD terms could still rise).  Also, if some miners lose interest, the "proof-of-work" gets easier, so it becomes easier to mine btc / new miners have a higher expected value of mining. 
It's a really brilliant, self-correcting method.  I'd encourage you to read the original white paper.  It's actually digestable if you have some fuzzy memories of calculus.

Maybe. I think the two are pretty different, though. The Winklevii are trying to create a USD denominated ETF to bring Bitcoin mainstream.

You've got to remember than bitcoin (little b the currency) is weird in that it's like M1 and gold mixed together. It's both currency and store of value.

People can speculate, but merchants can't accept the currency.  So it's on the rest of the world to allow transactions to happen.  Otherwise the currency has no value.   - it was mixed news at best.

@_date: 2013-12-31 21:37:50
Truth.  This is great for old school investors that are skeptical of Coinbase et al because "cold storage" sounds scary and techie. Regardless of their security features, the bitcoin wallets are still not yet licensed MSBs or banks, SecondMarket's BIT and the Fortress Fund on the other hand are more trustworthy if your an older, non-tech investor that doesn't have the time to do a bitcoin dive.

@_date: 2013-11-20 18:19:32
Very fair points, but I disagree on all of them.  
1) By the time CoinBase is forced to lower it's 1% fee (which I acknowledge is inevitable in the long-term), it will have a long rolodex of merchants who have been using their free merchant tools (up to $1mm) - big first mover advantage.  If merchants stay happy, it will be tough to sell them on a switch. 
2) I really like your point on the "big players", but I have to imagine that if CB maintained its market share of new users looking for a bitcoin wallet (and I'd bet that a larger percentage of new users since May were non-techie consumers like me, who wouldn't trust international exchanges and looked at the only available domestic bitcoin "bank"), it's hard for me to believe that the 1% fee would have dissuaded them.  Especially on the sell-side, where you're talking about users that had already locked in 2x, 10x or even 100x gains.  Talk about a drop in the bucket.
3) We'll have to agree to disagree on the first-mover advantage.  The odds of the U.S. shutting down the U.S. market leading pseudo-exchange or even encumbering it's growth is just about nil if you watched the Senate hearings and understand the fear that DC pols have about harming this new massive economy - the internet of money.  CB is in violation of MTLs unintentionally and working on them nationwide.  It will probably help write the rules not avoid them.

It's a value added service for consumers who want to reduce their volatility.  So it will only ever cover a fraction of bitcoin holders and even then only a capped portion of their holdings.  If any hedge fund can provide collateral, and any wallet holder holding funds at a secure service provider can access the BDIC, and there is no government-backed lender of last resort, I don't think people will consider the service centralized.  
Would be no different from saying that Coinbase is attempting to "centralize" bitcoin because they protect customers' bitcoin on their servers and in cold storage.

I absolutely agree with your point, however, it's not about the units, it's about the total transaction volume.  Buying 0.1 BTC now is the same USD value of buying 1.0 BTC this spring.  The unit volume 1) doesn't matter for CB, and 2) probably driven by new buyers.  How many satoshi / Winklevoss / BTC Investment Trust buyers and market movers do you know that are putting in bit sell orders?  And to my knowledge those guys haven't been buying all the way up.  
I could be wrong and would love to see the charts, do you know where they would be?  Could be very interesting for my next  blog post (sorry, I had to.)

Not sure that I agree Paypal should give up.  It wouldn't be a leap for them to offer merchant services, but would be to create their own pseudo-exchange a la CB.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:16:07
This also confused me and really pissed me off.  I bought at two high prices under the impression (from their language) that I had option value and could cancel at any time if the currency went up and they then ratcheted up the price.  Instead the orders got queued and I paid the higher price as soon as they could fill the order.  
I'll stop short of calling it bush league, and give them the benefit of the doubt that it's growing pains, but they should definitely clean that up.

China is going to reverse course sooner than everyone thinks re: merchants.

The average accredited investor and institutions can't invest in Coinbase accounts or hold digital currency directly because of compliance/reg issues. But they can invest in SecondMarket or a fund like Fortress's, meaning more institutional investors will have access to bitcoin.  Whether this is an unlisted ETF doesn't matter, what matters is access for big money investors. 
This is big news because institutions move markets, not retail investors.

I can't even pretend to know buy/sell activity, but some people have commented that the big "Bitcoin Days Destroyed" transaction from last week could have been the result of something like this: an institutional buy. That's the only way to move this kind of volume for both a buyer and a seller.

Point is that the major fear going into these sessions was whether government would cripple innovators in the space with onerous regulations, due to national security fears, consumer protection and interests in the USD.  I didn't hear many (if any) people talking about a major tax issue which would alter how bitcoin is held and traded by US investors. If you have, I'd love to read more about it.

You are incredibly naive. Bitcoin would exist without anyone like Max Keiser, he was just a lucky con that learned about it early and participated in the same pump and dump schemes he criticizes.  We need to pick our own ambassadors to keep bitcoin credible, so that jerks like Keiser don't get quoted on CNBC and make us all look like radicals.  
Free speech means he has the right to say that without going to jail.  There is nothing about free speech that means the rest of us need to listen to the garbage that Keiser spews and take it quietly. This point was proven when he deleted his tweet.

Good points, but I think you need to look at the valuable services that can be built on the Bitcoin protocol.  Nothing wrong with making money!  But if you can provide a service that is better, faster and cheaper than the status quo, you've got every right to put money in thy purse.  
I also disagree with the BTC hyperbole, but I make the business case for the currency's evolution from speculative investment to world changing utility.  I'll do that gradually at my blog if you are interested in following.

I agree.  She is awesome. 
I think "funding and support" is relative.  The BitPay team were into Bitcoin two years ago at least, so they must have $millions just from their early exposure to the currency.  
That said, I fear that BitPay will eventually be pressured to sell to PayPal.  They are the only pure merchant processor in cryptos, so it makes sense, and Coinbase, Circle and other up-and-comers look like they will be two-sided or more consumer-focused.  (Which ultimately must happen to execute more off-block chain transactions.)   
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:50:00

Merchant services like BitPay, CoinBase (and soon Circle) are making it a no-brainer for merchants to accept bitcoin.  Merchants can now accept bitcoin and instantaneously convert the digital currency to their USD-denominated price for a mere 1% fee.  Contrast that with the 3% fees (plus chargebacks) that payment processors like Paypal and WePay charge and you've got 2% of additional pure profit.  Moreover, the more entrepreneurial merchants and bitcoin believers have the ability to "let it ride" with the credit card/bitcoin spread.  That is, they may keep the 2% in credit card savings in bitcoin (which could conceivably continue to rise in perpetuity)...like a free option, which should make total sense to company shareholders.

@_date: 2013-11-21 00:02:14
This is a speculative entry which addresses an argument that can be made for CoinBase as a billion dollar company.  Would I invest at that valuation?  Maybe...if I knew their actual financials.  Primarily because I think there is a good chance that most of the "cash" on this company's balance sheet has been kept in bitcoin, meaning their actual cash flows are significantly higher.  So this becomes both an industry bet and a company bet.  I didn't factor in all of the one time legal that will be required as a startup cost.  (Besides, I know you M&amp;A guys are fans of adjusted pro-forma run-rate???) 
There are certainly big risks, but this week's Senate hearings put to bed the concern that the U.S. will harm bitcoin in the near-term with over-regulation.  If anything that could help CoinBase as they will help write the rules in the coming months.  
As I explained in another comment below, I think the mainstream users of bitcoin's currency (esp. the ones that wouldn't just circumvent the "wallet" and buy from foreign exchanges directly) are perfectly fine with Coin Validation.  Seems better than their typical banking relationship. 
Exchange fees will get arbitraged down, which is what makes the CoinBase story so compelling. Right when that fee arbitrage starts to hit, you'll start to see them "turn on" their merchant services fees.  Competitors are always going to pop up.  The question is whether you believe a two-sided market maker (consumers / merchants) in an industry reliant on a big peer-to-peer network, is better than a one-sided market maker.  History's on CoinBase's side (ePay, Google, LinkedIn).     
You talk about the bitcoin world as it is today. I'm talking about the bitcoin world as it will be - with real non-computer scientist consumers who rely on the layer(s) above the actual protocol to make sense of the whole damn thing.    
Regarding hacking: over 90% of the digital currency CoinBase has is in "cold storage" so it's literally impossible that more than a fraction of their currency is stolen unless hackers coordinate an attack on their "hot wallet" with a full-scale bank robbery (of a big brick and mortar bank). 
Finally, I put my faith in Paul Graham, Fred Wilson, Marc Andreessen.  Not your mopey M.D. who told you that bitcoin was a fad.  
Source: I did banking six years ago and venture capital after that, and am now an award-winning entrepreneur.  Valuation plus reading the tea leaves is what I do.  So, learn a valuable lesson in title-dropping young gun, and good luck trading BTC.  
(I believe if you were in my shoes you'd probably say "drop the mic." :-) )
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:32:49
I would bet so.  The only way to move that kind of volume if you are an old bitcoiner would be to make private sales.  Impossible to buy or sell that quantity through the exchanges, so certainly makes sense.

You are very wrong on economics.  CB makes a 1% fee because it is a pseudo-exchange, a layer on top of the bitcoin exchanges.  So really it's making 70-80 bps on all buy-sell volume.  
And you are telling me that processing of $150mm/ month is off based on what? They were at $15mm in may, tripled user base, tripled moving average value of the currency in USD, and 5x US transaction volume.  That's normally compounded 3*3*5 = 45x, and I used 10x because the transaction volume probably double counts some BTC-BTC trading.  
So if you agree on the 150, then you're 0.2% is 4x too low. or about 1.2mm a month.  Not inconceivable that they have 10x volume in six months.     
You also chronically underestimate the first-mover advantage in a market like this.  Circle won't be competitive for months and they are the only other company in the conversation right now.

Couldn't agree with you more!  The context for the title was in reference to irrational fears (I think) that the U.S. would try to hinder the progress of the domestic Bitcoin ecosystem through unreasonably difficult regulations surrounding AML, illicit goods / services, etc.  To me, the most tangible "regulation" which could impact the U.S. industry wasn't getting discussed, and that's the tax treatment of the currency.  
Of course the exposure (and positive atmosphere) was good for Bitcoin, much the same way that investments by venture capitalists, appearances on financial news programs, etc. are good for the market.  But taxing Bitcoin as a currency, would do irreparable harm to the U.S. ecosystem.

I'm dealing with it pretty well, and not profiting (yet).  You also insult me by failing to recognize me as a "former VC." I'm a doer now, but having that background makes me dangerous and attuned to the fact that 99% of the world (the non-early adopters of Bitcoin) care more about the economic benefits of a cheaper financial system than completely anonymized digital world.  
You are proving my point with the BitTorrent analogy.  People can so easily steal music now, so why is Spotify a monster, Netflix?  People aren't going to deal with your install, because they will always trust a vetted third party more when it comes to their money. 
Agree to disagree.  I'm a libertarian and a pragmatist, not an anarchist and idealist.  That means that I'm all for the best ways to promote gradual steps towards decentralized authority in a country where both political parties want more federal power. 
If that makes me unsuitable for this sub, then bitcoin will eventually be worthless, anyway.  I think most people will agree with me.

Totally agree.

I think the tech implementation would take months with AMZN and in the meantime you'd have an unbelievable amount of short-term speculation. My thesis is that merchant adoption and bitcoin txns as a currency need to gradually catch up to percentage held for investment. Otherwise, you'll break the illiquid markets. 
Really interesting dynamic though!

That I can't comment on, but you are right. It will take close collaboration with banks, and Circle seems to be building the more formidable fin services team so far. I think that matters. Relationships are everything in banking.
