Escrow is possible, but not necessary for face-to-face trades.  They have a "fund from wallet" feature similar to escrow that essentially proves to the buyer that you have the coin available.  The "fund from wallet" feature is different from escrow in that the seller can cancel it if the deal is canceled.
Escrow is only advisable when using non-personal transactions like bank transfers.

Use a payment service such as Coinbase or Bitpay. They guarantee the exchange rate the moment your customer sends payment. It takes the risk out of the exchange rate game and still remains cheaper than credit cards.

I agree.  What OP's graphic doesn't say is that it was his entire statement.  The interview moved on to a new topic immediately afterwards.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:36:56
When you create a Bitcoin transaction by sending or receiving BTC, the transaction is recorded into a block in the blockchain ledger.  Each block has to be confirmed by being solved by a specially-tasked computer on the network.  Confirmations tell the recipient that the transaction is legitimate.  
These computers are called miners and the reward for solving a block is a certain number of Bitcoins (currently it is 25 newly-generated coins).  [Here's an example](
Naturally, 25 BTC every ten minutes is a huge incentive, so there are more people doing it.  These guys in OP's post are doing it with thousands of times more computing power than most people have, hoping to solve a block before miners with a lower hash rate.  Most casual miners who are actually turning a profit have anywhere from 500G/hash to 6T/hash.
There's a little more to it than that, but there's no stealing involved (unless they're stealing electricity, of course).
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:42:45

True. It's not bad if you're moving significant amounts of money. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:52:00
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:57:45
Also, FYI, the fee is completely optional.  Some wallets will allow you to opt out of sending the fee.  The downside is that the mining incentive is now gone and your transaction may take hours or even days to go be confirmed.  I don't recommend leaving out the fee, but if you want to try it with a small amount, go ahead.

I found a process that works for me:
* Buy a physical Starbucks gift card and register it on their website.
* Buy Starbucks gift cards on Gyft with Bitcoin.
* Log into Starbucks.com and transfer funds from Gyft gift cards to registered Starbucks gift card.
This way you get both the Gyft benefits (for using BTC) and the starbucks benefits (for using a registered card).

For most everyday transactions, confirmations aren't necessary.  
Once a transaction of the correct amount is posted to the Blockchain, it can be accepted by the merchant.

To illustrate, the guy in the blue hat refers to his paranoia about broadcasting his Bitcoin IP to strangers on the internet.  The fact that this statement is flawed is not my issue.  No one corrects him to tell him that it's not an IP address and the coins are not being stored on his computer.  He clearly is very cautious about an overwhelming new technology and they do nothing but laugh about it.

Local Bitcoins is a popular off-blockchain wallet. Coinbase is also one, but it's been suggested that they track their coins' movement.  You don't actually get your own coins back after depositing them to an off-blockchain wallet.  You get an IOU and most of the coins go into cold storage.

If even one mBit is moved from one of those "dead" addresses, conspiracy theorists and Ponzi schemers will have a field day.  At this point it's incredibly risky to even touch the earlier block rewards.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:14:10
Cool.  So aside from learning about the protocol intimately through the experience, are there advantages of doing it this way?
In other words, when I tell Mycelium to send 1 BTC from address *a* to address *b*, what automated decisions am I missing out on?
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:12:44
Oh, I see. Good idea.
Do you manually type out the 512-character private keys for the inputs? That seems time-intensive. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:29:18
I'm still looking for it too.  :(

I think I have heard that before now that I think about it.  I recall that the primary purpose of meters isn't revenue generation, but for keeping vehicles from stopping for long periods, as you said. It just seemed odd to me at first that you couldn't re-deposit money and stay longer.
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:31:29
Sorry, I misunderstood your question. I don't know. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:39:12
It's run by a friend of mine in South NJ. He says he hasn't had any BTC orders yet (from strangers anyway).

@_date: 2015-02-20 02:53:43
It's good so far.  Pretty fair reporting.

I think it went better than expected.  They're not going to ignore the elephant in the room.
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:00:57
Yes, I have met up with two people in the past year.  One was a buy and the other was a sale.
I have also gotten many other requests that were probably scams (Paypal, venmo, gift cards, etc).  Another large number of requests were for amounts too small for me to waste my time travelling to them.
It's a great system, but it just needs more people.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:17:42
*All* the addresses?  ;)
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:04:13

Oxymoron of the day. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:51:37
For amusement, I actually downloaded a miner app for Android in the hopes that I could generate a penny a day on my phone.  It didn't even get that far.  Haha.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:29:54
Yes.  By about a hundred US dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:28:58
Those coins are gone forever.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:11:08
That's an awesome idea, but I don't think they pay out cash.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:39:52
You can, it's just not nearly as productive as an ASIC setup.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:04:52
Yes, but this is not the intent of the system. To truly support the system, exchanging fiat currency for bitcoin should result in the eventual trading of bitcoin for goods and services. Simply holding and selling won't help the network at all. 
That said, if you just want to buy low and sell high, you can do that too.
Edit: before people begin correcting me, any purchase or selling of bitcoin does help the network by altering the supply and demand. But it wasn't designed for that. It was meant to be a currency itself. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:15:31
Or spend them on actual travel at cheapair.com ;)
But you're right.  Any money can be considered worthless if its never spent.

Yeah, it's absurd.

The miners who make money are the ones who pre-order the hardware and have it on day one.  It often does pay for itself, but nothing more.  After the first month, you're competing against others with the same hardware, thus your competitive advantage is gone.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:35:05
That dollar sign is incorrect.  Should be a bitcoin.

With my high-school-level knowledge of the German language, I'm surprised at how well I understood most of that.  Today, Bitcoin helped me exercise my German!

Bit-*Coins*, motherfucker.  Do you speak it?
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:43:19
I (sadly) know many who would walk down the block, pay $2.50 to use an ATM and pay another $2.50 on top of that in bank fees.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:45:24
Yes, but do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Educate yourself to understand what you are doing. Bitcoin is volatile and unpredictable and no matter what anyone here says, it's impossible to see the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:22:35
Haha.  "Forgot" the zeros.
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:35:31

@_date: 2013-11-12 17:28:10
It's not always immediately apparent that it's a divisible unit. Several times I've tried to explain it to people and they think that a $2 cup of coffee is going to cost a whole bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-18 21:00:20

@_date: 2013-12-03 00:55:16
That's understandable.  If you were trying to send him money for the sake of helping him out financially, that makes sense.  If you were trying to illustrate the ease of sending via Bitcoin, it was too much.
Ah well, lesson learned.  Just make sure to bring it up *a lot.*  :)

Pro-tip: Call up and ask for them to waive the fees.  Then when they refuse, switch to a credit union.

Occasionally they pop up, but they give out about 0.0001 BTC at a time.

Bitcoin will.  Vendors preying on the ignorant will not.
They still got my money today, but I will not be back.

Some of them have girlfriends.  Some of them have holidays coming up.  Some of them want to get laid.

For an even better analogy, how many of your USD (or whatever country you're in) are physical?  Save for the $36 in my pocket, mine are all digital in the bank.  They could stop printing tomorrow and I'd still have my USDs.

So where did this 60 BTC come from?  Did it come from the accounts of others?  If you don't return it, does it get deducted from average Joe's account somewhere?
