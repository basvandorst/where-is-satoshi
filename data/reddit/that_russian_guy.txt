Thats not even close to true, unless you measure corruption by the amount of money exchanged instead of a relative percentage.

The exact same logic could be used to tell people to buy lottery tickets as an investment strategy.
You might win (like how bitcoin MIGHT go to 100x it's own value in a few years) "It's worth the risk".

Fucking brilliant. There are only 2 million pet rocks sold in the world. Which means it should go for about 5-6 times more than bitcoins. Why aren't you on EBay right now spending 4000$ on pet rocks?
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:23:49
Very carefully.
As a serious answer, you could completely control the price of some stocks by buying and dumping huge amounts. Or purchasing every entire bank and investment firm of the country and running them into the ground.

Not sure if you're asking about the "honey badger" part but the saying "Honey Badger don't care" was a pretty popular meme sometime in 2011-2013. Here's a [page]( about it. Honey badgers are generally representative of people or animals that don't give a shit about anything.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:12:32
You're still saying that because it MIGHT make you huge gains you should invest in it. That logic could be used to say you should buy lottery tickets and penny stocks. Just because they are competing does not imply they will equalize in the slightest. You wouldn't dump all your money into a convenience store just because it's competing with Walmart. As another example, there are many altcoins competing with Bitcoins. Would you advise this person to dump his savings into some other altcoin because it MIGHT beat out Bitcoin?
It's simply really bad logic.  
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:41:24
Again, you're making the same mistake. You think a transitional period does absolutely nothing, but it does. For example recession is generally cyclical. Does that mean nobody was affected by the 2008 recession because eventually it went away?  Also I'd like to challenge your claim about how quickly it corrects. Got any sources for that? I'm also interested about your software. Care to share any technical details? Not calling bs just would be interested as a software developer.

Have you ever traded in the real world? Check pretty much any stock after Warren Buffet announces that he has bought in. And remember that Warren Buffet would be an order of magnitude less powerful than Satoshi.


Yes because the transitional period for something that has high entry costs would have 0 impact on the economy. That's like saying that collapsing every road in the country would do nothing at all because eventually new roads will be built.

So many things wrong with that example.
1) It's not a stock, it's a highly volatile currency. The two are very different financial instruments.
2) It's not a rich person buying into or selling bitcoins it's an exchange having withdrawal issues. 
3) A few dumbasses may have sold at 102$ but the general price stayed around 600-700$. As of right now it has not corrected to pre-panic levels.

For that to happen 1BTC would need to be worth 600,000$ in 4 years and for the Bitcoin market cap to be greater than the GDP of the United states. Not saying it's not gonna happen, but it's not gonna happen.

Is this a real question? He will have more than 10 times the power of the richest man on Earth. It's not a difference of a few percent it's a difference of 100 times. The impact of a trillion dollars is 100 times bigger than 10 billion. If someone wanted to crash a countries economy they likely wouldn't be able to do it with 10 billion but could easily with a trillion.

So you don't see the difference between explicitly paying someone to murder a former colleague because he might expose you, and paying taxes? If we go by this logic then every person alive is guilty of every crime that exists. Have you eaten meat? Animal cruelty! Have you ever purchased any electronics? Child labour and slavery! Have you ever paid taxes? Guilty of imprisonment, murder, and everything shady the government has ever done.
To clarify, do you think hiring hitmen should be legal? Or do you think that paying taxes should be made illegal and be punished?

Not really that's time dilation. That happens everywhere just on a smaller scale. So the first human would be the first time traveller. Travel implies going back and forth not just forwards at a different pace.

He is being called delusional for implying that normal amounts of devaluation and inflation is not a characteristic of a perfectly healthy currency. For example, if a currency gains value day by day, why would you ever spend it? People would just hold onto it which means it's no longer a healthy currency as its not used for the purpose of trading.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:36:18
That was a really long way to say "no you're wrong" without any arguments.

Don't be stupid you know what I mean. Circulation if you will. The flow of currency between parties. The flow of cash.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:26:57


If a currency is preferred to be held rather than spent, it's not a good cash flow.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:12:40
Would this have anything to do with the fact that price is driven up by new people buying into bitcoins, meaning price going up and the population using it going up are correlated? I'd be interested to see the proportion of people holding vs people spending and comparisons of that proportion to another currency like the USD, which would be a far more meaningful statistic.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:43:07


Sure, by your definition. By your definition stocks, beanie babies, TF2 crates, and pet rocks are all good currencies. If you don't agree I can prove every single point. They meet all the requirements you've stated above.


I can sell shit for it. Check.
Even by your own definition bitcoin is pretty flimsy. There are still plenty of things or services you can't buy with bitcoins as it's still a really young currency.

Because worth is defined by how money something needs to be made rather than how much people are willing to pay for it. This is why USD is worth exactly the same as a sheet of paper and ink, regardless of the value printed on it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:17:01


Can you provide these examples?


Obviously some people will spend it. But when the primary purpose, which was the point of my post, is not trading but speculating and holding value, it's no longer a good currency. For example, gold is going up and it's a fairly popular commodity. Yes there are some people who spend this gold. No it is not at all a good currency. Are there any sources that compare how much people hold vs how much people spend with bitcoins? Is there a comparison of this statistic with something like the USD? I'd be interested in finding out.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:00:33
Plus it's not nearly as fancy. You can't be a great crime lord if you don't have style.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:56:25
That's a valid argument. I'll try to define what a healthy currency is.
Healthy meaning that it will continue it's function as a placeholder of value, will be wanted by sellers, can be exchanged for the majority of services or goods where it is meant to be used (eg the country that has that currency) and will provide sufficient cash flow in order for the economy to stay stimulated, for the foreseeable future. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:46:21
I like how you avoided my questions.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:04:25
Couldn't a major wallet such as blockchain simply transfer all bitcoin funds to their wallets then? Wouldn't that be sabotage? 
Ok how about pet rocks then? Just keep them in a safe and it meets the above requirements. There is no central entity for pet rocks. As evidenced by ebay they can obviously be bought and sold. And as evidenced by my friend trading his shitty pet rock gift for some pokemon cards back in the day, trades can be done. They sure as hell aren't common or liquid but that's not in your criteria.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:37:37

@_date: 2013-12-18 20:28:35


This isn't true either. We still have yet to make any measurements or research to see how other dimensions work. All we can guess now is that around 10 exist. If time turns out is a separate dimension it would be logical to assume it can be traversed forward or backwards. There is also FTL, special spacetime geometries, and wormholes. There are numerous theories like that which would be possible even within our current model, and that's just based off things we know now.


Sure and then just going through time at a regular speed is time travel too since you're travelling forward. If you define it like that the word "time travel" loses its meaning. 


It's pretty much as negligible as one meter above your head. The all-time world record for time dilation is 0.02 seconds over the course of 747 days in space, which is 1075680 minutes. 
Gagarin's flight was 89 minutes. 
Also notice that in the page for the [time dilation record]( it specifically says that time dilation is not considered time travel.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:53:32


Like I said can you provide any statistics that I've explained previously that would actually prove this? Of course they DO my arguments is that they don't do it nearly as much as they would with a devaluating currency, which makes it a pretty bad currency. 
Also, can you reply in one comment? Reddit only let's me comment once per 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:33:24


Because they need it right now, or within a reasonable amount of time?
If you had 100$ USD and 0.1 Bitcoins (about 100$ USD) and expected Bitcoins to be worth 10000$ in a year and USD to go down by 5%, which one would you rather spend? 
Your comparison works if Bitcoin is the only thing that the person can spend at which point they have no choice, and is not at all a typical situation. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:56:39
Can I ask what you thought I meant? I can't think of anything you could logically think cash flow means in this context except for what I meant. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:16:31
I did define it actually. If you didn't make this over 100 comments spread out it would be easier to read. 


Do you expect me to prove that there is literally not a single person who is doing some action? That's beyond stupid. Someone somewhere is burning their cash to warm their hands. That doesn't mean it's what typically happens or that it's rational to do so. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:21:48
Sure, USD (which I never noticed in my original post) may be experiencing problems or too much devaluation. I never said devaluation alone meant the currency is completely healthy. There's nothing healthy about Zimbabwe having 10000%+ inflation. But to think that a devaluating currency means it's not a healthy one JUST because it's devaluating is delusional.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:55:47


@_date: 2013-11-28 22:16:23
Sure thing.
Let's go with something as simple as TF2 items? I'm not too familiar with that market, I'm more of a Dota 2 trader so I'll use that since I have good knowledge of it. If you want me to repeat the process for another game I could, but it will take time. 


Most certainly. Go to steamcommunity market and purchase it. As easy as bitcoins.


Sure thing, same place, OR go to a trading site and sell it for real cash.


Yep. EG 


Yep. Like above.


Yep. Unless you steal the password or somehow scam the user, it's secure. 


Item values are determined by the market. For example Lockjaws (a courier) are roughly 250$ but used to be around  30-40 a year or so ago.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:21:54
Ive said it before and I'll say it again. The proportion of people who hold a currency increasing in value vs those who spend it is a higher ratio than a currency that's devaluing. This means lower circulation in the first case which damages the economy and is thus a bad currency. How is this not falsifiable. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:54:28
It's not semantics your statement was simply untrue. Time dilation exists everywhere meaning you don't have to go to space to experience it, nor is time dilation considered time travel unless you consider going through time 1 second per second also time travel.


We don't know that yet. It's possible time travel is viable in both directions but we haven't discovered the mechanism behind it yet.
