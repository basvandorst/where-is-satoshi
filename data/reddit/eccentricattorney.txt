I understand some people feel it could of been written better but they limit you to 800 characters including spaces, not as easy as you think.  But thank you for supporting it.

Who cares anymore, the Mexican drug lords will save bitcoin, they are sitting on enough cash to buy the Chinese bitcoins 10x over..  And don't forget the Russian's too.  This is just the beginning of a new life
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:23:02
How do you do that?
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:27:44
Interesting premise, the only comment i have is i would like to say that the closing price was below the 430 if i am giving you till jan 1st 2015... anything can happen fro a dip below ie just a large seller on the exchange etc....just a thought, the price would be below 430 for a 48 hour time period anytime in the next 6 plus months?
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:34:47
Let's come up with a fair range and I will put my money where my mouth is. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:48:16
It looks like I am out of the wood we held and now will start the uptrend

If we can get 100,000 signatures President Obama will review the petition and comment.  If you dont believe me please check out the We the People Government site,"The right to petition your government is guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We the People provides a new way to petition the Obama Administration to take action on a range of important issues facing our country. We created We the People because we want to hear from you. If a petition gets enough support, White House staff will review it, ensure it’s sent to the appropriate policy experts, and issue an official response."

Does anyone know how we can make this a sticky so it hangs around for a bit?   Thanks 
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:38:14
Don't tell anyone. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:35:01
Thanks don't hate....participate

The problem is the merchants convert their Bitcoin to cash almost simultaneously with the purchase to protect their cash usd or euro value. They don't hold them. Additionally you have the majority of mined coins with large groups that dump them after mining them to take their mining profits. Before their was more diversification in who got the coins and that we held them or invested back into the infrastructure.
Just my two cents 
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:23:00
Thanks, point well made!!  This is larger then just bitcoins, this is about the implementation of a new technology and not stifling  its development.
Please send this petition to your friends and family, we need for it to go viral. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:02:27
Good luck
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:40:35
If we can reach the 100k signatures you will get their attention, better then complaining among ourselves. It only taxes a minute or two of your time.
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:11:13
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:13:11
I called the bottom of the bitcoin price at $430...So this run to 524 is my gift to the bitcoiners world wide....(no pizza needed)
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:05:39
It's a shame there are 535 upvotes and only 180 people signed the petition....
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:32:06
Actually the US banks are realizing they need to participate in virtual currencies. So the Fed has discussed how to regulate bitcoin etc. Which is actually positive. The big boys want to play with us. So this is just the start of a repricing 
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:35:28
Thanks  for your support. Please spread the word. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:54:20
thanks, my first tip!!

Yesterday was a close call... Lets see what happens tonight...
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:12:12
The more petitions that are done the more segmented and less of a chance that any of them will get enough votes to be reviewed. Additionally they limit the length to 800 characters which makes it a challenge to write. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:29:28
Said well. Yes it's about making the call and putting our money where our mouth is. I would of taken the bet if it was to shave my head or a bitcoin or anywhere in between.  
I was a trader for Charles Schwab for years and a
CMT. I think bitcon is the best investment (though high risk) in the markets right now,(maybe long silver  and mining stocks but that will take time to develope). I think a run to 25-50k can happen in the next 3-5 years with a long term look.  The bottom is in on all my charts, but since there is a data issue multiple exchange data and limited historical data there is risk I am making it to early. But if I am right hopefully I will go down in history....lol 
Let's stay in touch....

My bet
[–]theinfiniteidea[S] 2 points 19 hours ago I can agree to that! Are the terms below in bold agreeable to you? On January 1st, 2015, if the Bitstamp exchange rate of 1 bitcoin has not been less than $430.000 for any consecutive time exceeding 48 hours between May 9th, 2014 and January 1st, 2015, then will pay 1 bitcoin on that day; if the Bitstamp exchange rate of 1 bitcoin is ever less than $430.000 for any consecutive time exceeding 48 hours between May 9th, 2014 and January 1st, 2015, then will pay 1 bitcoin on the following day this event occurs.
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:54:34
I see I am not the only fool up late watching someone run the price on bitcoins tonight 
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:48:08

I think my side has more risk as he has 7 months for a dip at anytime. For me to win we need to go up and hold it. We can be at 1,000 jan 2015 and I can still loose. 
At this moment it's anyone's game and I believe I have the harder side to win. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:13:33
What's up with china lol
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:26:52
It's a typo theinfiniteidea it should be 430.00
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:11:39
Were up to 8 now!! I feel the momentum....
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:43:05
Where are the mexican drug dealers and the Russian Oligarchs, they are the savor of bitcoin.   Fck the PBOC.  
The real problem is that we are in a down draft and the miners just keep dumping their coins... 
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:29:19
Yes but how many people who tried this list money in Mt Gox. There was always a spread between them and bitstamp even when they could withdraw. People got sucked in and then they suspended the withdrawals. So be careful. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:26:25
I would love to see the price sell down to a dollar I will buy 5, 000 at $20 so I don't think your right there are many more like me waiting to buy if the price drops 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:06:32
Obviously you haven't read the rules of the site. You are limited to only a few hundred charters and you don't offer a solution you ask for them to respond and reconsider. I wish people would research before they make dimd remarks 
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:24:39
That's not true if he buys it today his lose is capped. I believe we both have put a bitcoin aside already for the bet. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:33:57
I will take that bet...
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:53:05
did know we would become so popular.... guess we got 14 minutes left
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:24:25
Do I get a vig for each bet made?  
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:40:12
Why 200 plus down votes why the hate??
@_date: 2014-05-04 17:43:57
Not true....There are ways to create synthetic shorts which will increase the number of bitcoin in existence. Look at the stock market there are more shares in existence then issued due to the ability to short using options and other synthetic tools. 
So that thesis is not accurate. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 03:07:32
I am willing to take the bet let's set the parameters etc. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:28:33
Yes Mexico will be a huge owner of bitcoin they have so much drug money that they need to hide andobe bitcoin is perfect for them. Which is good for me as they will buy and hold. They could corner the market like the Hunt brothers did in silver. 6 billion is nothing they have that in cash sitting in closets and suitcases. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 03:06:03
You have yourself a Bet!!
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:06:53
Good luck my friend.

It's the reporting requirements that come with the IRS's interpretation.  It  hurts consumers, miners and merchants.  There is a good article on COINDESK, that goes into detail

Please consider signing my petition asking the irs for a new class for bitcoin and other crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:28:47
I am an attorney and my first thoughts are don't worry. You are not the victim, you sold the bitcoin and acted in good faith with no knowledge of crime.  It's not your issue. 
Close the account, move on and don't answer or reply to their calls emails etc. Short of a the police showing up its not your problem. 
How long ago did this happen their are laws for fraud like this and it is 30 days.

I was selling casascius coins not bitcoins, and prior to selling them i opened a ticket with paypal for an opinion from them and they have not responded the request was over 6 weeks ago.  I  am sure they are doing this because bitcoin is a threat to their business.  Either embrace it or perish.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:52:27
I am a user and buy 1pm est you couldn't buy they had a message that they reached there max trades for the day.. and of course the bitcoin went up 200 from there and I couldn't buy... they might be trustworthy but not dependable for liquidity.

I have nothing against the fine people at piperwallet, but just an FYI they use thermal paper and if exposed to heat or light it turns black and you can loose everything printed on it, it was a great idea but has a huge flaw. (thermal Paper)
