This is a great response, fully agree.

Hi As I said I'm not following the debate closely so I'm sorry if I am mistaking things, but I think that my statement is factually correct... 
Here's Wladimir: 
Matt Corallo:
There's obviously a bunch of Peter Todd all over the place as well.. 
Thanks for the BIP! I think your proposal is the way forward :-)

To be fair, Gavin's and Mike's approach is changing the minds of the developers who at first argued for no change at all. Furthermore, it has increased awareness for the issue in the community. Personally I don't agree with their 'lets jump to 20mb right away' approach. However, without claiming to be an expert on the current status of the debate, it does seem to be trending to a 'how to fix the block size problem' discussion as opposed to its initial 'whether we should fix this at all'. I agree with when he says that at the end of the day the users will be the ones who decide.

FYI Coinfloor released the Coinfloor Market which offers faster payments support through peer-to-peer, exchanged-backed and vetted brokers.

I've tried it in the UK and in Spain!! Its SOOO much cheaper than the local competition :D :D :D I'm hooked.

This would only take them a few hours to do (if they are very disorganised). I frankly don't know why all exchanges don't do this. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:41:00
Great stuff guys! I share the love for Coinfloor!

If you are looking for a used one for a good price and guarantee go to any CEX shop :-)

I still think you can be more transparent about your pricing. Here is an example of a company which does a great job at it while using a spread model.

Agreed. I did a quick search and didn't find this linked (I thought it was odd). Thanks!

OP, I agree with all your response points thanks for replying. 
In your original message you didn't really state that they changed the limit from 100 CAD to 1000 CAD. If this is the case, this seems unfair from the POV of an SME so you should definitely pick this up with Bitpay and consider changing provider.
Good luck sorting it out! 
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:04:21
This sort of blind attacking on anyone is one of the reasons why this subreddit has become so toxic lately. Bitpay is one of the few bitcoin businesses that have REALLY helped this space become what it is today. If OP had done basic due diligence before engaging a payments provider like Bitpay, he/she would have known that there is a withdrawal minimum amount for cashing out in non core currencies. 
Coming to reddit and saying things like '[...]. Now Bitpay does this.' is really hurtful for the space in general. Bitcoin is TINYYYY and we really a community effort to have it grow. So please try to be friendly to each other and stop the mob-like behaviour. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:18:18
haha I was just going to say this. The fact that bitcoin is a bearer token and can be stolen is amazing :D
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:47:42
I don't know who has the liability if the messaging platform gets hacked, although i'd be surprised if swift got all the liability. Conversely, i'd be surprised if banks did not get the liability if their access to the network got compromised and they started sending 'unauthorized' transactions to other banks. 
That being said, technically speaking while money is 'lost' in this fashion, the bank(s) that is out of pocket simply has a liability to the beneficiary bank(s) and manages it through its balance sheet and normal settlement process.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:17:27
Try Coinfloor! 
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:28:42
For those of you who don't know, SWIFT itself is just a messaging platform for banks that send messages that agree to the SWIFT standard. 
It is unlikely that SWIFT itself was hacked.. Its more likely that n number of banks' software that sends SWIFT transactions on their behalf got hacked.

Thanks for your efforts This is totally a viable future use of bitcoin :-)

Definitely going to carry one when spending with bitcoin :-) 
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:24:01
Mike Hearn does not argue against bitcoin being used as a settlement network. He just asserts that before we get there  it's important to give it a fighting chance to have it work as a standalone payments network.

I really miss the Blackberry days when I could do this :-) My next phone is definitely going to be an android one and I'll look out for a replaceable battery one. 
The Note 4 is too big though! 
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:43:23
I feel like the title of this thread gives a wrong TL;DR
@_date: 2015-08-04 07:26:18


I disagree with this. I think most people that use bitcoin do not fully understand the implications of a blockchain for settlements vs a blockchain for payment systems. That's why TL;DRs are important. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:56:58
Why is it that I thought would happen when I posted this. I was looking forward to hearing from people who had similar experiences when buying with bitcoin at the POS. Instead i'm called stupid. This subreddit is not what it used to be, but anyways... 
I use breadwallet on iOS. Even with SPV, syncing with the blockchain drains like 5-8% of my battery every time. Regardless of the battery issue, bitcoin is not easier to use than a debit card with chip and pin or NFC. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:58:39
Its unfortunate, yes. Usually you go to the pub after work. Iphones don't last the whole day on average use...  Syncing the blockchain with SPV also drains more battery than it should imo!

There's different between regulation and banking. Coinbase being regulated would not give them a UK bank account. Your 'but' implicitly states otherwise.

This. 
I would recommend however to 'save' their website into an index.html file so that you can create the transaction offline. This ensures that they can't get your private key.
You can use the download link provided by them on their website here.

I disagree with most of your comments. I have personally met the couple a couple of times and Max is quite knowledgeable about bitcoin, the network/blockchain and the economics behind it. He does go a bit over the top and I don't agree with his pump/dump mindset but it is because of people like Max (alongside many others) that bitcoin managed to get off the ground and become what is is today. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:50:02

Technically speaking a seed as you refer to it in HD wallets (Master Private Key) is also a 'normal' private key.
