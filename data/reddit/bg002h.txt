Glad to hear it. I've been running Bitcoin Core with roughly 50 or so connections on 100/5 Mbps cable without any form of throttling. I _totally_ understand the latency issue you describe. Bitcoin Core wasn't very fun to run from home anymore. Addy's B1 is (IMHO) the best implementation out there for the busier/less technical amongst us (and perfect for the Bitcoin enthusiast who rembers the good old days when everything was just easy).

If you add the Thai keyboard on iOS (sertings&gt;general&gt;keyboard), it changes the US keyboard such that a long press on the $ yields a pop up list that includes the ฿ symbol (and the ₽ on iOS 8 for Russian currency).

As chair of the elections committee, I remind you that the voters made this decision. But you don't need to trust me on this. Each voter has the hash of their encrypted ballot and the list of ballot hashes is available to all voters. That's the benefit of the Helios voting system that we used. The results of the election were available to every voter the moment I decrypted the results (which presents challenges to writing up blog posts when you need to have headshots/bios prewritten for all possible winners). 
It's not my place to judge the voters preferences. It's my place to measure them.

We write $1 and 50¢ in the US. Do other nations do something similar for the equivalent of $0.5?
Would bits be 2500b or b2500? 
If we do 2500b, what symbol do we use for Satoshi's and where do we put it? 2500.22b?
@_date: 2014-06-14 23:34:18
Satoshi anticipated some degree of centralization: 
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."

I donated a small amount of money in bitcoin to become a donator. It turned into a lot of money. That doesn't change the fact that I donated a small amount. I'm glad that the donation was held in the same spot for years and that theymos didn't cash it in. I want the lights to stay on over at bitcointalk for a long time. They're still on. I'm happy with my donation. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:28:32
It might as well be. The ideas in the book are very relevant to bitcoin users and the money used in the book is functionally eerily similar.

You forgot one thing: you also have to ask them what they will do with their purchase...and analyze their response for hints of a crime and probe for evidence of a prior crime or thoughts of a future crime. And then you have to document and submit it to FinCEN...via a secret report the buyer can not know was filed against them.

This is a stupid request for any privacy respecting bitcoin enthusiast to ask of the foundation. Your asking the wrong party. It would be a huge breach of privacy for the foundation to disclose the address of their members. 
I don't get it phin. You are not stupid…you should ask KnC for their private information to see this transaction (and any other transactions you can deduce from the disclosure). You are also smart enough to realize why KnC might not want to share private financial information with you or anyone. 
Since you're smart enough to know all this with out me telling you, what's your real angle here?

Mining centralization is not a requirement of the system; it's merely how people have chosen to implement it. There are bad reasons that centralization could occur (government force) but just because mining centralized does not mean that entry into the mining sector is centrally controlled. 
Truly worrisome mining centralization would be one that precluded hash power providers from reallocating their hash power at will. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 12:27:11
Is that true? 
"Bitcoin is currently able (with a couple of simple optimizations that are prototyped but not merged yet) to perform around 8000 signature verifications per second on an quad core Intel Core i7-2670QM 2.2Ghz processor. The average number of inputs per transaction is around 2, so we must halve the rate. This means 4000 tps is easily achievable CPU-wise with a single fairly mainstream CPU."

Bit reserve is a brilliant concept. The legal stuff will be far harder than the code. I'm surprised they permit unlimited transactions; the risk obviously goes up with tx volume…taking a tiny %/yr of assets they hold on a customers behalf seems less risky.

Glad to see another physician in the Bitcoin world. By your screen name, I see you must be a fellow radiologist as well. (Edit I looked through your posts in I presume your a real doc…with a decent handle on radiology jokes!)
I have a physics/math background and I feel similarly about the technical aspects of the debate. The devil is in the details and we want to think carefully before we leap. 
The personal attacks will always be there. Trolling is part of Internet life. I do think there have been some genuine misunderstandings amongst the real devs though. No one is advocating for never increasing the block size (that part wasn't clear early in the debate) and I think that started a series of false conclusions …

If miners chose to, as a group, to only honor first seen tx's, 0-conf works fine. It's their policy choice at the end of the day anyhow. However they want to run their part of the network is up to them.

Ever try it? I can assure you we are very interested in it,snd while its a great idea, someone needs to do a lot of implementation work to design the right software for it. It's far more complex than most realize (unless we open up the ballots so that everyone can know how everyone else voted). 
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:45:04
I'm most interested in making an accurate measurement. I realize there will be complaints about any system and I'm not looking to substitute one set of rules with measurable complaints for a second set of rules that break the old ones and bring with them new complaints that can't be measured. I have no way of knowing who amongst those that are eligible to request a ballot actually care to do so. 
That can be measured, but it takes proof (hence posting each claim publicly on the Bitcoin Foundation forum is an obvious choice). We can count the number of complaints by following the "problems voting?" thread. We need people to speak up and be counted accurately and actually post!

Why make people take action to complain? I kinda expected a large apathy rate...80% is more than I expected, to be sure, but it is certainly a plausible apathy rate...I don't think anyone would disagree that it's quite plausible...

Hi guys. Brian here.
I want to measure the effect being discussed. Please encourage people to post here who have had problems voting: 
I wrote the ballot. The number of voters was purposefully referenced in the unchangeable ballot to preclude any allegations that the voter list was rigged ex post facto. If any voter gets added to the list, the world will know because the list of voter aliases (ie v1, v2, etc) and the hash of their ballots will be published. 
That is an intentional transparency step (as is using Helios Voting; you don't need to trust me or anybody that the ballots were counted correctly). 
Now, you may be wondering: why do we need a step to confirm active members? This has been debated publicly and the rationale is to ensure we can hit quorum. 
An election should simply be a measurement process. I strongly prefer the actual election to be very boring and mundane and easy for all to see was done correctly no matter who runs it. That's the standard I want to set for the foundation now and for the future (long after I'm finished serving as committee chair). 
I strongly feel that we need to document and categorize every voting irregularity. If this issue effects only 2 or 3 people, it's unlikely to impact the election outcome -- but we do not need to rely on chance, we can prove it true or false..._if_ we have data. That data needs to be public and discussed openly. 
Forgive my iPhone typos...

@_date: 2015-02-14 22:27:42
Please please please post here and register why you had trouble voting. We need accurate data regarding irregularities. If 50% show up to complain that's extrememy useful. Don't forget, the big picture is measuring voter preference...there must be some system to do that. If we prove the system sucked, that's far more helpful than supposing it did.

This is the ballot (except the choices are randomized each time the browser loads the ballot):
Select ALL candidates you would approve of being elected to the board of directors. You may SELECT AS MANY CANDIDATES as you'd like. There are TWO seats to be filled by this election. There are 364 voters and thus quorum will be met if 183 ballots are cast. A winning candidate must have approval of at least 50 percent of the cast ballots; thus, a second round of voting may be required. Please remember to MARK AS MANY CANDIDATES as you approve of. (approval, select between 0 and 15 answers, result type absolute.)

Cross posting my experience with Datashell here (essentially the same post as on bitcointalk):
Wow…Upload speeds are crazy fast (~2.8 MB/sec…likely limited on my end). Program runs flawlessly in the background (OS X ML); no problems closing the laptop lid or rebooting.  It gracefully resumes where it got cut off. Functions similarly to Dropbox and allows the upload and download bandwidth to be limited independently.  So far very impressed.
