Honest question, why not just toss it on a roulette table instead? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:31:12
This is actually good news for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:47:45
How much do you have with mtgox if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:13:24
God damnit
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:49:59
$200 probably 
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:38:45
There are no facts, OP is jumping to his own conclusions 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:20:15
Couldn't agree more
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:54:37
Boo hoo, correlation does not imply causation, stop jumping to your own conclusions like OP

I downloaded the database, and you can find the links in the other posts on this subreddit. The file just shows usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords for each user.

@_date: 2011-06-19 19:03:01
How will they revert it?
@_date: 2011-06-01 19:33:56
I only heard about Silk Road today actually. Do you have any links/news stories from April regarding the site?
@_date: 2011-06-10 23:39:40
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:51:36
Not much they can do with the file other than spam your email.
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:07:58
Best and most reasonable answer so far
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:17:59
What's the processing power on that beast?
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:11:50
I bought 7500 bitcoins for $0.77 in January, I'm thinking of selling them now since the market is rapidly falling and I feel it will level out at $14. Plus my eyes hurt from starting at the charts for 15 hours a day.
@_date: 2011-06-12 16:09:07
Please stop looking again
@_date: 2011-06-08 19:11:15
Could you please explain what the green line in the middle means?
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:06:30
Just what I was thinking. Unless the guy is rich, I sure as hell wouldn't consider going from $1500 to zero with $50 investment a simple $50 loss
@_date: 2011-06-07 22:02:38
you mean 0.65 cents?
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:42:57
and now they're worth 1400 times that within a few hours!
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:22:26
Saying that in this subreddit is not a good idea.
@_date: 2011-06-23 08:22:38
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:14:52
clever boy....
@_date: 2011-06-01 18:54:24
Although the article was written today, it says "He entered his address and paid the seller 50 Bitcoins—untraceable digital currency—worth around $150"....... odd
@_date: 2011-06-07 20:15:04
Here's one from last week
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:48:58
At least the passwords are encrypted.
@_date: 2011-06-23 10:06:53
And yet you're the one receiving all the downvotes? 
@_date: 2011-06-23 10:40:07
You really love to throw tantrums don't you? Grow up and act more mature.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:56:58
didn't you read what I said. The passwords are encrypted so no one can see your passwords, just your email address.
@_date: 2011-06-01 21:19:16
The article mentions it:
"Getting to Silk Road is tricky. The URL seems made to be forgotten. But don't point your browser there yet. It's only accessible through the anonymizing network TOR, which requires a bit of technical skill to configure."
@_date: 2011-06-11 20:58:16
Good luck obtaining every single bitcoin in existence before short selling
@_date: 2011-06-01 19:32:37
Thanks. I find it amazing how the website accepts nothing BUT bitcoins in exchange for drugs. I fear it may give governments more ammo for an eventual ban on bitcoins in the future.
