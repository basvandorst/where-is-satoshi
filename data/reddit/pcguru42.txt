This is the problem with Bitcoin... If its only good as a "Store of Value" why bother? I want a digital currency that I can amass, spend, and save. Also, let's say I'm a millionaire, why the hell would I invest in Bitcoin just to be put on a Rich List? I'd rather my wealth not be publicized to the world. I dumped all my BTC at the end of 2017 and now it's just a waiting game to see who comes out on top. 
I'm not sure about the lightning network because it is a centralized solution from a decentralized currency. It seems like a band-aid and not a long-term solution. I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion but I just don't see BTC making it.

You sure? Looking in the past I thought the old record was 170k unconfirmed. I have this pulled up on my browser and it just keeps going up, so I'm think something has to be going on. I leave it up on my tab and its just been shooting through the roof these past couple hours. 217.6k right now.

Sorry, but anytime someone brings up IQ its where my mind goes lol. I think the fact he is president means that anything is possible and that anyone can understand Bitcoin. Its just those that are really intelligent will do it faster. You still have to put in the time to understand it, no matter your IQ.

Damn good stuff, thanks for the link. I suppose only those that submit high fees will get through and the rest will just sit there until it dies down some.

In theory, it should eventually go through. Although, if the fee was nothing, then it might not ever go. Its kinda up in the air which way it can go. If they put at least a $5 fee it should go.

EOS is the biggest blockchain scam out there. It has 21 entities called "Block producers" that basically run AWS instances to create the EOS chain. Its a joke and only a fool would put money in that. Also, there entire mainnet froze a couple days after launch. Also, there was some news that China valued it ahead of ETH that I read today which seems very off. There is just way to many red flags for me to put anything into that other than time. Probably the crazy thing about EOS is how much money blockone has and that is little to no distribution of the tokens in circulation. Something like 90&amp; of the token circulation is held by a dozen wallets. I just marvel at how screwed up the whole project is, and there is that many idiots in the world.

Hell come on guys, I'm not advocating storing coins in an exchange. I'm just saying hardware wallet isn't as 100% as people make it out to be. 
**FOR ME** Exodus.io is a hot wallet where I control the private keys. This is a medium between the two methods. Exodus can get hacked and my info is still safe as they don't have the private keys. Where an Exchange can get hacked and you're screwed (i.e. Mt. Gox) Please make sure you educate yourself before tossing your money into an exchange, hot/cold wallet. I keep seeing an influx of new folks, which is great, but make sure you understand the pros and cons of each method and pick the one that will work best for you!

Just to play devil's advocate... Let's say you lose your hardware wallet... You are equally screwed. Personally I find a happy medium between the two and use Exodus where I can control my private keys, but don't have to worry about my computer blowing up or losing my hardware wallet. 
Now that said, I'm just a hobbyist with a little bit of crypto. If I had millions, hardware wallet in a safety deposit box ftw.

How in the hell is Bitcoin going to be the future when transaction fees are so huge. I don't get it, core obviously has to be working to solve this massive issue. I just can't believe people are still hyping bitcoin with this giant problem. I didn't notice until I spent some BTC last night, and I had to do a double take.

Dash is a scam get out man, here is my case and point...
Shows top 100 address with the most dash. 2000 merchants with X number of transactions? Cool
Now on to Monero:
Who has the most Monero? Don't know because no one knows. How many merchants, websites, transactions? Don't know that either because everything is hidden. Want to look up transactions from one specific address? Don't know it.
You see what I'm getting at right? If people want transparent transactions they will just use bitcoin. Dash has no real world purpose. Do you want to compare bitcoin to dash? It has a few more merchants lol.
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:26:43
You are smoking crack, no way are people giving up bitcoin for dash. This is heresy, dash will never be bitcoin, replace it, or be used more than it. NEVER!
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:05:05
Can't tell if is joking or not. Monero has some of the most real world adoption for any alt coin. That said, it's mainly dark web transactions and silk road ripoffs that are using Monero daily. The average man doesn't really use Monero as the transaction fees are so high, but Monero's team is working on that with bulletproofing. The other big turn off for Monero is it isn't very user friendly with Payment IDs and Wallet IDs for certain transactions (i.e. exchanges) and I'm betting there are some folks that have lost some money by forgetting the payment ID when depositing to an exchange judging by the large red print on every exchanges monero deposit page. I think Monero has a LOT of potential as Bitcoin started off much like Monero has. That said... DASH is a shit coin with a good marketing department. There is no future in DASH and everyone knows it except those people hodling it and the folks running the masternodes.

Yeah! Start comparing it to a roulette table please.
