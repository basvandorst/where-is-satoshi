Supposedly Mark K. confirmed this is a confirmed draft and legit.

I think that's the best course of action for now.
Regardless of whether or not this document is real, the damage has already been done.  The perception is that the money is lost, and Mt.Gox isn't going to make owners whole again.  It's priced into what we're seeing now.  
Even if / when the document is proven to be authentic which could take weeks of independent audits to unravel what actually has happened, I don't think it will impact the price much further than it already has.
I think buying cautiously, depending on your investment strategy and risk tolerance, is a good one.

Two things I'd like to get your feedback on 1) It's well documented that the height of the last three 'bubbles' have been exactly 234 days from peak to peak.  I've always had the feeling deep down that this was evidence of manipulation or logical forces at work in the market rather than a free market determining the price in and of itself, although I recognize that possibility.  Given this 'new' information,  what are your thoughts on the perfectly bizarre time-period between peaks?  Could this have been heavily influenced by an outside force consistently acting on the market -- causing literally the same results in regards to duration of peaks over time?
2) The idea that Willy changed / manipulated the market price upward is definitely apparent.  The price has run from the single to double digits into the triple and quadruple digits during Willy's tenure at Gox. However, in the ~4 months since Willy's departure from the market, in a post-Gox market the price has readily sustained a level that was ~50x - 100x higher than where the market price began before the price was being so viciously manipulated.  
If the current post-Gox price is the true market price, and even if our run into $1,100+ territory was artificial, it doesn't seem unlikely that the market price could run another 100x within the same time period moving forward into the future.  It may take a bit longer to naturally hit those prices, but when looked at in the context of  I think this makes complete sense.
What are your thoughts on this in regards to the current price post-Gox?  Do you agree?

I cannot believe the level of denial.  The document is obviously authentic.  
If your 'proof' of lack of authenticity is grammatical errors... that means absolutely nothing.  The document was obviously thrown together quickly (you can see it's a draft), and shows a level of inside knowledge of the situation consistent with the events that have unfolded over the past 12 hours.  
I'm actually willing to bet BTC on its authenticity.

I enjoy the notion that the similarities in his writings can't prove to you that it is him, but the differences in his various writings can somehow disprove that it is him.

It's funny that you say this.  Everytime there is a price movement, a certain % of this community cries "manipulation!".  Just a few hundred coins sold or bought at a single time are enough for people to start yelling that.
You're talking about an amount that is nearly 500x the amount that people look at and scream about manipulation on a daily basis.  That is a LOT of coins and fiat on a daily basis given how shallow the markets are.

But your question was "why should I use Bitcoin"... you can't separate those two issues.  This is exactly the point.

Good luck trying to move your own money around if you're in possession of or plan to be in possession of more than $10,000.

"Nope" was in reference to your blow-hardy statement that I've been indoctrinated to fear the word criminal more than I fear the word state.
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:39:46
Nope.  Pretty sure some criminals are absolutely inclined towards violence.

These types of articles and comparisons need to be stopped.

I work with Twitch executives closely on a lot of things.  I will bring this up in person.

Aren't these OTC and BB stocks that literally are the highest risk investments you can make in a "stock" market?  Most of these aren't real companies, but shell companies or scams designed to bilk investors.
Why compare BTC to them at all?!
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:30:47
Oh... well, glad that's settled then.

I want to believe this.  
However, the fact that he was arrested in a villa in Spain with the same man he outs in this article as a federal criminal speaks otherwise about his intentions and past.

Do you have a bank account?  Nearly every major bank provides users with a check card, which acts exactly like a credit card... except instead of drawing on a line of credit it draws from your bank account.
I'm pretty sure nearly everyone legally in America can have a bank account if they wanted.

Bloomberg is a conglomerate.  This absolutely does not represent a true conflict of interest in the context in which you've used it.
Samsung for a long time made chips for Apple phones.

He was disagreeing with you, and your response is EXACTLY!
I feel the premise of this whole thread was very poorly thought out and will be linked from soon.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:54:17
That's the sad reality of it.  You're right.

There was no auditing.  There was no system of checks and balances.  Someone more than likely knew about this and exploited it.
Their software had a major flaw in it, combined with gross incompetence and probably theft somewhere along the way we are now living in current reality.
Stole this form another thread that sums it up nicely regarding the 'leak in the hot storage'... "it means they kept filling up the hot wallet not noticing that their accounting didn't add up. like idiots."

Good feedback, and your point about the distances between peaks and reversals is definitely taken.  It's something I already closely follow.
However, I don't agree with you regarding other exchanges reaching $1,000+ on their own.  Gox in its hay-day owned a very large portion of the total Bitcoin trade volume and was for most purposes THE market maker.  Most websites, including used Gox as the definitive "price" of BTC.
Didn't we see this with the previous crashes, and even most recently in February during the "flash crash" due to Mt. Gox?  Even in death, the actions of Gox pulled the price down with it very significantly, exerting influence on every other exchange which equals the accepted price.  
Why do we accept that Gox pulled the market price down (and not just recently, it happened throughout its history), but not up?

Dude you're comparing Bitcoin to other well known ultra high risk investments, most of which are complete scams.  
Using your line of thinking, it's basically saying, "If you invested in Bitcoin you would have lost less than a Nigerian Prince scam!" and then using that as validation of Bitcoin.
Do you not see what's wrong with that?

1 - Where are the interviews you promised on your 'media tour' with big media outlets regarding PayCoin?  So far all we've seen is the press around you buying BTC.com.  
 
2 - Why did you state you spent $500K a minute to stabilize the price of your coin when very simple sniff-test and analysis of the market during launch shows that this couldn't have been possible. 
 
3 - Why did you state Authy told you GAW users were stress testing their system and made references to your rivals, when Authy themselves came out and said they clearly couldn't release stats to 3rd party sites?
4 - How did you not know THIS could have been a possibility when launching the coin?
5 - Why was Paybase launched without any actual features, creating a situation where all users could do was speculate on the price of XPY?
6 - What is the state of your 'CAF'?  How much did it have in it, how much was spent, how was that money spent, and how much is left?
7 - Why is the PayCoin logo literally the same logo they've used at onlycoin.com for nearly a year?  Why was the Paybase logo also a rip off of another well known logo?  We're to believe these are BOTH random coincidences?
8 -  Do you feel you embellished your relationship with Amazon and other partners to garner publicity given their public statements about GAW?  If not, why not?  Any comments on CoinFire's articles?
9 - Why did you edit all references to the price floor you promised to establish with XPY after failing to maintain the floor?
10 - What are your plans to reimburse investors?
Answering the above 10 questions will clear just about everything up for me and MANY others in the community.  Thanks.
Full disclosure, I'm not an investor in XPY or anything GAW related.  Just a stander-by watching this all unfold as impartially as possible.
