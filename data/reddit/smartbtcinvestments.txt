Hahaha love it :) The perspective of mathematics this meme suggests is slightly wrong, but hell this is funny and tells the story pretty well.

Bitcoin is backed by trust. 
With the Blockchain there is no manipulation of printing new money, leveraging interest, credit, taxes and whatnot.

Regal Assets is another option. They have an extremely secure vault in Dubai and also a partnership with Brinks. With their Bitcoin IRA you have the option of storing your keys inside of a cold wallet or have it in a cloud wallet where you have secure  &amp; limited access to your keys. I don't know all of the details, but they just started sending out kits. More information available [here]( if you are interested.

The entity is the people. As long as people trust that Bitcoin is Bitcoin, it will be used. The entity backing Fiat money is Central Banks so idk how much you trust them, but I hardly do.

[Coinbase is good]( but you can always move your crypto to an offline or hardware wallet.

Bitcoin already is Digital Gold. Ironically, it's value functions exactly as Gold behaves and occurs in real life. Makes me wonder who Satoshi Nakamoto is lol

Whoops I guess you're right. There's going to be a hard fork on Oct. 25 and SegWit2x a few weeks later.
