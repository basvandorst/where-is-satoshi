Being right most of times and wrong sometimes doesn't make illiterate. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:58:22
And who will enforce this ? Regulators.

Sure. But BTC isn't the new system we need. It's a step in the right direction, but we need something better.

Day trade on stable pairs like ETH/BTC is really safe and you can easily make 2-3% per day.

On those pairs, there's very little spread, you can't be too greedy. And in the woest case, you just end up with a good crypto.
