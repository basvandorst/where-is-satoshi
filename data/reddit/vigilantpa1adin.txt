Arn't most mortgages fixed nowadays?  
@_date: 2012-05-27 06:32:47


Huh?  If rates are low, I have less incentive to pay off the mortgage.  
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:17:30
Yes.  Sell now!  Sell everything!  Don't hold a single Bitcoin back!  Don't worry, I'll buy it when you do.

Now for the spoon!

Excellent link.  I've read this question many times and I had yet to seen it.  
@_date: 2011-06-11 02:16:35
So stupid... This happens every time Bitcoin hits a new hight.  It's still up two fold over just a few weeks ago.  Its not a crash, its a very small market.  Get used to it.  Bitcoin will not be stable until more people start using it for every day transactions.

I'm mining with almost 10x that speed and I get about 10 btc a day.  
@_date: 2011-06-08 20:34:34
Ha!  Indeed.  Thank God I bought in when it was .50 :D
@_date: 2011-12-14 04:42:48
Yes, the date is correct.  I had heard that Dwolla transfers took a while.  I attempted to contact Mt. Gox a few weeks ago, then about a week ago, and again today.  There has been no response, so I have resorted to making this public.  I will keep everyone posted.

I've heard of world-wide shortages of video cards that are useful for mining.  How can we add more infrastructure if we can't buy equipment?  
@_date: 2011-06-27 15:11:00
AWESOME!  What a wonderful thing.

2 boxes... I meant to say 3 cards, not 4.  I get about 1.3 Ghash/s (about 420 MHash/s per card using pheonix).  I'm thinking about adding one more box with a 5850 (I was just given a motherboard and processor).  The difficulty rate is going up so fast that I'm not sure if I will though.  
I use Linux (Ubuntu).  Didn't spend too much on cooling, about 50 bucks on a fan controller so it would be quieter (I was going to buy one anyway) and 4 fans between the two machines.  I don't have them crossfired, they seem to get hotter with it on.  I don't really game so it didn't matter to me.  


My thoughts exactly.  
@_date: 2011-06-13 05:39:07
It's okay. After a month you will start to see the same questions over and over.  But how will the newbs learn if we aren't actively talking about it?  
@_date: 2011-05-11 21:01:03
Great response, thanks!

I've made a few Bitcoins in trading today because when it first dropped to 10.50, I strongly suspected that today would be a very silly day.  
Every once and a while, the market is going to test the price.  Since it has been floating just below 11 for a few day with a very low volume, there tends to be a movement to test to make sure that price isn't too high.  It will probably be back to 10.50-10.75 soon, unless there is a major meltdown.

How do you know this?  Does Google's crawler look for lists of compromised emails?  Did a Google employee submit the data?

You so funny!  There are no crazy people on Reddit!

You need to know how to use flags properly.  I have not experienced any choppiness on my Linux box from mining when using the proper flags, which only results in a -.009% difference in hashing speeds.  
BTW I recommend Linux for everything except movie editing and windows gaming.  
@_date: 2011-06-08 08:11:26
This.  I used to be at bitcoinpool.org, but they had too many issues and their developers are really mean on the boards.  I am now mostly at Eligius (about 4/5) and the rest is at deepbit (1/5)

Yes; Liberty.

Seriously, that's why I'm in it for the long haul!  Yet I'm called a "hoarder."  :/

In order for Bitcoin to accept widespread acceptance, we will need financial institutions.  Some people don't want to worry about having a wallet on their computer, and they would rather give over the duty of security to a Bitcoin bank. 
 I definitely see room for some sort of Bitcoin debit card, if only connected to a local file.  
Good luck.  
@_date: 2011-05-24 06:09:03
I think Bitcoin will be much easier to use when we have financial services that enable easy transfer of Bitcoin, no matter the medium.  
@_date: 2011-05-12 21:16:44
Of course! And there were more countries than the US when the Bretton Woods system happened too!
"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  The banks are VERY powerful (2009 anyone?) they have our governments wrapped around their fingers, and they will do everything to make sure that their system is not threatened.  Bitcoin represents the largest threat to the banks/central banks ever, that I can think of.  
Your countries' central bank cannot control monetary policy when it cannot control its currency.  That is what Bitcoin represents.  Mark my words, it is only a matter of time before politician begin targeting Bitcoin and its kin for banning.  Banning won't happen? LOL!  They have banned before, they ban now, they will ban into the future.  That is the evil nature of our governments:    
The justification will be, "But we need to protect the sovereignty of our countries currency!  And plus, Bitcoin is digital!  It's not as good as our *fiat* currency (at which time I will prompty LOL.)  No one should care if we ban it because we don't like it."  Yes, I am forced into using Fed notes as it is.  
Oh and yes, Ron Paul can win.  And if you have bitcoins, you better hope that he wins.  
I used to think Ron Paul was nuts!  Then I started reading about economics, especially libertarian/Austrian/Chicago school/free economics.  Then I saw what he truly is.  A wise old man who has tasted the depths of the wisdom of liberty and has taken her advice.  
If you don't believe me, and Ron Paul looses and we are stuck with some other half witted statist monkey (God, I hope not Romney) and then bitcoins are banned, the president either won't care, shrug it off, or he will be pushing for the ban.  Maybe if that happens, the wisdom of liberty will make more sense the people of America.

AWESEOME!  Google, I knew that it was not wrong to love you!

You get better speeds, less overhead, more power, but it is harder (or impossible) to flash the bios of the cards.  I have 6 computers in my house... all of them run Ubuntu.  I do love Linux as it is.. but I have my reasons.  Example: I have no idea on how to go about making a headless windows machine.  It's really simple in Linux using screen and ssh.

I will.  :-)
@_date: 2011-06-03 07:05:53
Indeed!  That appears to be the case.  
@_date: 2011-05-12 19:33:50
Lost you?  In what terms?  I will make the assumption that you were talking about why I would care about Ron Paul winning the Republican nomination.  
The government could very well could attempt to shut down Bitcoin (Although it would be nearly immposible, just like bittorrent.)  Ron Paul is the only candidate that supports competing currencies and he would fight for the legalization of Bitcoin as president.  For example, Cain worked for the Federal Reserve in the past.  He has shown no desire to change the status quo of the dollar monopoly.  He would take no action to protect bitcoin.  The feds don't like competing currencies because it takes away their power.  The Liberty dollar was recently shut down for legal issues:

I'm trying to sell high, buy low.  I've had a little bit of success.  
No, I am holding onto them because I think that if it catches on, it won't be 5 dollars, but 50, 500, 5000 for one bitcoin in a few years.  I could be totally wrong, and I acknowledge that bitcoins could be worthless in a few years.  But when I compare nothing vs thousands, it's worth the risk (and when I think about the condition of the dollar, it too may be worthless in a few years!)  Plus, everything that I understand about Austrian economics says that Bitcoin should take off like a rocket.  Even if Bitcoin fails, I want to be apart of changing the world for the good, in a place where Liberty flourishes.  Even if Bitcoin fails, the principles are sound; there would be a replacement, a 2.0, if you will.  
The biggest threat is the government (which is always a threat to liberty).  Also, if Ron Paul wins the Republican nomination (its going to be harder to win the nomination than the presidency) I predict a future spike in bitcoin prices because then we would have a friend of competing currencies in the white house.  
The government couldn't kill bittorrent, and the Fed couldn't kill Austrian/Free economics; Bitcoin is the beautiful synergy of both!
@_date: 2011-06-08 21:52:48
I think that sounds like a nice number.  
@_date: 2011-05-06 05:29:16
4 5870's.  I got 'em when they were cheap on new egg.  Now I would go with the 5850 if they get more in stock.  
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:38:14
Darnit.. You're right.  Lemme try again:
Bitcoin Bubble!  
@_date: 2011-06-03 16:20:55
If that's the case, it would be more profitable to just buy Bitcoins.
