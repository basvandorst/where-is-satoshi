I'm not upset about the fee, i'm upset about that fact that I had a bunch of small transactions that I had more than enough money for that were made a weekday prior to the insufficient funds one and I got an overdraft fee for each transaction. 
I doubt a credit union would have changed anything other than a lower fee per transaction.

Its all Tai Lopez's fault.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:10:44
Exactly I got hit for like 200 dollars worth of overdraft fees cause one transaction came through after the others were processing and they hit me with a fee for each transaction in processing status, even if the date was a day before the other transaction.
Would have rather they just declined it, I would have saved money.
It was my first overdraft though so they waived one fee, it was nice of them given their shady business practices.
Had it just been one overdraft charge for the transaction that caused the issue it would be different.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:06
Not sure why you only invested a dollar but here's a rough summary. 
Anytime you send money to another entity/individual work has to be done in the form of mining. Transaction fees are an incentive for the miner, the higher the transaction fee the higher priority given to the transaction. Since the pool is loaded up with a ton of unconfirmed transactions the amount for the fee to encourage the miners to work on that transaction first is higher than the amount you're attempting to send. I do not know if there is a way to adjust the tx fee coinbase sends at to a lower amount that will take much longer to be confirmed, it can easily be done with client based wallets tho.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:14:00
Yea man tx fees are the highest level. Its like 1000 satoshis a byte for instant confirmations right now, its ridiculous. The whole system is a mess and honestly reeks of sabotage.
I'd say invest in the developing around blockchain technology as its a proven concept, but I wouldnt look to  be developing for BTC its likely to be just another cautionary tale which paves the way for something much bigger.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:43:08
The unconfirmed tx's will come down when the price drops to a point where its no longer profitable to spam the blockchain with low fee tx's to artificially raise the reward of mining blocks.

Exactly so with the way the current system is designed it wouldn't work. However that doesn't mean it can't work within the framework of a new system that takes time and fees into consideration.
The whole process where someone can just pay a max fee and be in the next block or the block after that pushing someone out whos been waiting much longer is dumb and its part of the reason why the blockchain is so congested and that there are currently 10 fee tiers to get the transaction confirmed ASAP.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:54:32
what value?
Something is only worth what one is willing to pay for it. BTC is no longer required to get into the alt markets, it doesn't back other crypto currencies so how would this ever be gold and LTC for example be the dollar?
During the times of BTC being the gateway to fiat and other currencies this was true but you can now buy alts using fiat and exchange them for fiat.

Lightning doesn't automatically increase the profits of the HODLers tho. Lightning encourages using BTC as a currency and not as an investment. Which if the currency flows easily between parties and scarcity is no longer a concern this could hurt those who hold or think of BTC as an investment. However these are all hypothetical, we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
I assume because creating your own coin and achieving mass adoption is a lot harder than just improving on an original idea.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:10:16
Right we need to just downvote this LN posts and posts talking about BTC is gold and you cant use gold to buy shit either.

@_date: 2017-12-12 21:27:23
Probably because its inside of your own echo chamber likely based on past data not indicative of the current market and whats happening right now.
Yes there's plenty of programs out there to help out first time home buyers however they have restrictions based on the area. Like here for example most programs will only give you 270k which could buy you a really nice house in parts of the country. You could probably get a sweet place in parts of Texas for at or around that price, yet in somewhere like Cali that won't buy you much.
Yes its a sellers market right now and most of the country is in that same market. So yes prices are inflated.
Yes you can deduct it however if your itemized deductions don't exceed your standard deduction its a moot point. Given the new tax laws and the increase of the standard deduction I'm not so sure this will be a selling point in 2018. I'd have to go over the new tax law a lot more to know for sure.
In answer to your questions - In Market, no, yes, no.
Edit: It sounds like you bought at the right time and that you were ready for this decision. You do not sound anything like the OP though. Also I have no idea where you live but on the subject of 130k, that wouldnt even buy a condo where I am. I could probably get a place that's condemned and needs like 100k worth of work tho.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:37
I mean based on the wording you'd have to track the price of BTC every time you bought it, then the price you sold at to get an accurate amount. This is easy when it comes to stocks cause its all tracked for you. I assume coinbase/other exchanges would have a way to show how much you bought and when.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:19:13
Hope the price drops to beginning of November levels and all the noobs stop blowing up the mempool with new buys.
Not too many good alternatives right now. ETH was effed, LTC was effed, you could try one of the bitcoin forks.

No. You bought bitcoin when its value was low, the asset appreciated and you are required to pay taxes on that appreciation.
That second part of your post, well I'm not a lawyer but if you do that both of you are gonna need one.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:08:21
The point is back when crypto currencies first started exchanges drew a line in the sand that they would only support BTC. They took the line away and are starting to support alts now, meaning BTC is no longer the gateway to alt coins.
As XRB grows in popularity, exchanges will see this and add it.

No 5 years of rent is likely not more expensive than capital gains taxes + 5 years of interest on a mortgage + selling/buying costs + moving expenses.
5 years of rent might not even be cheaper than 5 years of a mortgage payment and insurance depending on what you buy, home much down and what you rent. Lets not even add extra costs like repairs and upkeep.
Unless OP finds a sweet deal on a house that needs work 1.2 BTC isn't even enough for 20% down to avoid paying PMI. Then OP has to work on the house and add more money so the house is worth more in a few years when they wanna move and sell. Doesn't sound to me like OP is looking for a foreclosed home or a fixer upper.
Owning a home in this case only makes sense if you're in it for the long haul and you want to let the asset appreciate over a long time period. &lt;5 years is not long enough. 5-10 years is alright, 10+ is better.
It's all subjective - we dont even know where OP lives, it could be silicon valley all we know. One things for sure it sounds like they don't plan on being there long.

I would say that saying the bubble has popped doesn't mean the currencies value has dropped to nothing. Anyone who's been following this for long enough knows this currency experiences bubbles, however the people who believe in it always help to usher in a state of stability.
The bubble poppers who think its going away and the value will be zero are dreaming.
I'd just like to go back to stability, its hard to use BTC right now.
These subs are funny at times like this tho.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:48:41
Yes capital gains taxes have existed forever however the IRS's position regarding capital gains and taxes on crypto was not established until 2014 and although the rule is retroactive, good luck collecting from the 2013 bubble. It was still the wild wild west back then.
If you're cashing out this bubble the dynamics are a lot different and you better keep track and pay your taxes.
My comment was more related to miner profitability tho and if they jump back on after the crash, as back in 2013 there wasnt much else to jump to.
So no "we" didn't ignore them, they didn't exist at the time in this regard.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:46:39
Eventually the bubble is going to end and people will stop rushing to buy. When this happens the lower fee transactions will be dealt with over the course of a couple days depending on how much of the miner community sticks around and doesn't jump onto the next profitable coin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:46:51
Yes i understand how it works. That doesn't mean its not a shitty system that needs some work, it also doesn't mean I can't suggest hypotheticals about how it could be better.
Theres nothing that says that can't work, it just wont work within the current framework.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:59
True, and its never going to stabilize in the current environment, however it was trending sideways for quite awhile before it exploded in value due to BS.
So having it trade at a range is what currencies do against each other in the financial market every day.
Plenty of people still believe in its use as a currency and being used to get in and out of certain markets efficiently even during the volatility, however not when fees are at these insane levels.
If you want to buy something thats 20 dollars and use BTC, it would be fine if the price jumped or dropped during that time period. however when you add on fees that are double the cost of the product pn top of that you have a losing system.

So wait you've just been collecting dust into a main wallet without regularly consolidating that dust into an easily usable wallet? Man that sucks. You might not be able to cash in on this boom.
Edit: Heres fees
Since you are consolidating a bunch of low level transactions into one the size of your transaction will be very high and will have a high fee. You're best off trying to consolidate a couple of times during low activity times and for a low fee which will unfortunately take a while to confirm but you won't lose money.
 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:38:37
Coinbase is the problem. Like how hard is it to set an economy fee tier that people can use when it’s just going to a wallet for storage and not for buying something right away.
any service or wallet without that feature is artificially inflating the fees that we pay. There’s no reason there should be 5 fee tiers for a transaction to be confirmed in the next block.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:06:43
right the system where higher fees bump yours down and then all these traders having to immediately get their money to their own wallet it is ridiculous.
Just guarantee it will be mined by X block at each fee tier.
Its like the miners see you've been waiting for a while and take you on as a charity case right now.
Like ohhh poor user put the transaction in 6 hours ago and is still waiting, we'll leave em in the block. lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:48:13
Because an exchange can close down and if you dont have your private keys you don't really own or control the money. So if they go belly up while your money is in there you could lose it.
Fees don't have to be high either it just depends where you buy your BTC from if they offer an economy option that takes a longer time for the transaction to get to your wallet for a reduced fee.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:03:09
Minus the fact that if you want to move within 5 years and your home actually sells for more than you bought it for you'll need to pay capital gains taxes on it based on the new rules, either way you'll be paying interest on top of that for the mortgage, which if you're young GL at getting a great rate from a bank. Then you add on property taxes and maintenance.
Telling a young person who's financial or credit situation you have no idea about to buy a home is incredibly shortsighted. Especially since they are young and a good amount of young people relocate a couple times before they find a place they wanna call home.
If they were committed to the area for like 10 years a house is a better idea. It doesn't sound like OP is to me though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:26:15
So 2011.
I feel like back in the day when we said things like HODL to the moon that this would be the moon.
Who knows though after this upcoming crash it could stabilize in value and then slowly rise over the course of another 2-3 years until the next mass bubble which gets us to the 100k per coin level. Capital gains taxes didn't exist at the bubble to 1000 though.

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:03:49
I wouldn't - BTC is only as valuable as people make it. As people leave BTC for alt coins due to ridiculous fees who's going to be around to give BTC value? Who's going to be around to settle lightning tx's to complete the transfer at whatever the settlement time is?
When BTC is only held by basically banks and people who see it as a store of value, it will have no value.
You need miners who are selling it to get paid for work and people using it as a currency to give it value, when those leave they'll be hard to get back. You would need a mass return to BTC by these groups, the question is if the alt coins being used do the job why would anyone leave?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:51:10
yea and plenty of things are different today then during the 2013/2014 crash.
Like back then you could get out for pennies on the dollar, the difficulty was much lower, it was one of the only coins around and the hash rate was a fraction of what it is today.
Even with all that the value still crashed to half of what it was worth at the end of 2013, and then stabilized.
Given what the blockchain currently looks like that would be quite optimistic. Further adding that mining pools could easily switch to a more profitable coin, making the block chain an even bigger shit show, back in 2013 there weren't a bunch of more profitable alternatives just waiting. Hopefully it will stabilize, however the whole thing where people jump on ever 3 or so years to make a shit ton of money isn't good for it being a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:53:53

None of those were parabolic movements based on nothing and MSM BS tho. This is way more similar to the drop of 2013/2014 after it went parabolic to 1,000 and then the next year was trading super low and traded sideways for awhile.

No that was the drop that happened in 2014 after the bubble burst in  late 2013. The Mt. Gox situation just made the recovery take longer.
Currency was trading around 100 all year, then out of no where a run up to 1,000+ - Thats a bubble.
Crashes happen after massive speculative increases. Just get ready to the buy the dip if you're using BTC as an asset and not a currency, because whats happening right now is a massive speculative increase. 
Edit: Granted it will still be higher than the last time it crashed as there's a lot of support at the 'bottom' just waiting.

No mining is profitable right now because they still get coins, at some point they will run out of coins and then fees will need to be profitable enough on their own to encourage mining. Which would be highly dependent on the price per bitcoin and the status of alternative markets.
Yes i feel given the current size per block and the amount of transaction volume that they need to make it to where miners do not choose and a formula that prioritizes fee's and time is used to ensure each block has an adequate number of different fees to still make mining profitable, raising the size per block to allow for more transactions would also be great.
If that can't be done they could at least not allow ala carte fees and instead have tiers of service - immediate, fast, normal and economy. The whole ala carte system lets people way overbid and way underbid which messes up the system for the rest. This could be done without reprogramming the entire system, however it would need buy-in from the entire community as most of that is controlled at the wallet and exchange level.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:23
That won't happen at these price levels. It needs to go back to a 3 or 4 figure value per coin so these people will go away.
