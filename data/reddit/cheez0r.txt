Mt Gox had issues with people selling BTC- they had a hard time getting payment made because of Karpeles' issues with with the single bank account and Japanese regulations regarding Money Serving Businesses, so they couldn't make payments at a very fast rate and that was the source of a lot of the constraints around selling BTC at Mt. Gox. They had no issue receiving cash, however, which meant that people could buy BTC for a price at Mt. Gox, transfer them to another exchange, and then sell them on the other exchange for price + X, leaving Mt. Gox with more cash and less BTC. Repeat a few dozen thousand times and you wind up BTC-poor and cash-rich in an environment where your cash is difficult to leverage. This is a primary contributing factor to the collapse of Mt. Gox (along with Karpeles' theft and market manipulation.)

No, it's not. They could sell BTC all day long- receiving cash transfers into their bank accounts and paying out in BTC transferred to the customer's wallet- for the majority of the time they were operating. What they couldn't do was BUY BTC and pay-out cash via transfers into the customer's bank account. (Edit: they could buy all the BTC they wanted, but when the customer asked for fiat from GoxBucks, they were hosed.) They had no transaction limits on their incoming transfers. This is asserted in my first sentence "Mt Gox had issues with people selling BTC." 
The sentence you object to could have read "They had no issue receiving cash or sending BTC, however." The issue was (as I understand it from having been hamstrung by it for almost two years) that their bank and/or the MSB laws of Japan limited them to a specific number of transfers out per day, and they could only service the "largest" transactions so it would take a varying amount of time (1-14 days) for your transfer to happen depending on how big it was. 
This is why this comment was one of the most frequent on Gox forums in 2012-2013...

Making fully accurate statements about that shadowbox clusterfuck is like summiting Mt. Everest... it takes a while, is prone to failure, and might even kill ya. ;)

Don't forget  Professional geeks who run data centers and whose management doesn't mind if they co-locate a few boxes there, as long as they don't consume much bandwidth. I'm currently trying to talk my management into this, a friend of mine has 22 machines in his work data center, all mining BTC. His employer doesn't care about the power/AC costs (it's a sub 1% contribution to the loads) so he gets to keep all the BTC he mines. I can only wish for such a situation...

I did for a while- at anything more than $4/btc I was making money (had I cashed out at that valuation.) When the price dropped below $4, I stopped mining, and I'm about to restart now that it's back up.
At 11c/kwh, my 600mhash rig was costing me on average $50 a month to run. It can produce (at current difficulty) ~16 bitcoins a month, which at $4/btc is $64/mo. At $25/btc it was $400 a month. So yes, real money can be made mining, if you cash out your btc at the right time. Or just spend them for real goods, like I am (web hosting and coffee.)

Just checked my kill-a-watt- with the box fan I use on it running at medium speed, it's pulling 640w, which falls in line with the $50/mo estimate.

At some point after the 'crash' we would generate the 2,000th block since the last difficulty recalibration. The difficulty would bottom out, and mining would become much more profitable, resulting in a swing of miners back into BitCoin. Unless every miner stopped mining, at some point, 2,000 more blocks would be generated, difficulty would adjust, and mining would become more efficient. And I guarantee that even if you lost the big pools, you'd still have the 10% of BitCoin users who are hardcore crypto-anarchist types and whom have invested heavily in BitCoin keeping it alive.

It's timing out. :/

Is your bitcoin app using any fallback servers? Do you have all of the blocks in the blockchain? Have you checked out your transaction in [blockchain explorer?]( We just broke 130,000 blocks, so you should have that many at the bottom of the bitcoin app.

Right- In a pool, the pool operator doles out hashes and returns found blocks. The worker (miner) only receives hashes and returns hashes.
It's possible to mine outside of a pool, but since it takes so long to find blocks these days, it could be months before you find one and get a bounty.

I think that until we get a font with a barred B in it, that it'll be just as you used in your example: B$1.50, or B€1.00, or B£, or B¥, etc. When they do finally implement a font with a barred B, same format, just using the barred B version.

Leaving $174k on the table must hurt, but hindsight is always 20/20. Cashing out to $0 investment isn't a bad move.

No, thank you for pointing out the great work shakethatbass did. I saw that thread get posted and I wrote it off as a scam, and now I regret that I did so. Hindsight is 20/20- much like not buying BTC at $20.20, I regret it.

Could be ten or twenty bubbles before the market capitalization is big enough to resist flash panic sell-offs after runaway gains unsupported by market demand.

Which would have lessened the sting of being scammed, but with the victim out no less $. It'd be the sort of noble empty gesture people would make online in the skeptical world inside my head.
