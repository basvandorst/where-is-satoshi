If you have a smartphone you can actually use it as a webcam. I've used [PocketCam for iPhone]( before and it works perfectly. Maybe you could try that? I'm sure Android has something similar if you don't have an iPhone.

Coinbase seem to be working now. Just register an account in the coinbase website. It'll require ID verification (photo of your ID) which might take some time to verify (for me it took 2 hours even though they said it would take 3-5 mins). After that you just register your card and just buy your bitcoins. I just started a couple of hours ago as well.

Yes, please. If you find out which ones are good please tell me.

Yeah, I tried signing up yesterday in Gemini before creating an account in Coinbase and found out they currently don't operate in Europe. Appreciate the advice though!

Ahh, got it. I'm definitely going for it. I'll be buying some ETH on Coinbase and set up an account on Bitfinex to exchange the ETH to IOTA later today.
Now when a lot of new people are getting into crypto currency I'm certain many will find interest in IOTA. And like you're saying, as soon as IOTA becomes user friendly the odds are the price will go up. Thanks for the help man! You honestly convinced me to buy some IOTA.

Will I be able to buy bitcoins then? Everything seems to be fucked right now on coinbase. Also, after buying I want to transfer it to a wallet. How long will such a transaction take now when everything is chaos, I'm reading about transactions taking forever in coinbase right now. Are there no other exchanges that are recommended to use at the moment?

I'm ordering the Trezor in January. Until then I want to store my bitcoins in a wallet on my iPhone. What wallet is recommended for iOS? It seems most people prefer wallets that supports segwit (not entirely sure what it is, all I know is that fees will be lower with it). However, **which is the most reputable wallet for iOS?**

As a beginner, I don't mind reading up on how to use more advanced exchanges. Which one do you recommend? I'm in Europe if that matters.

Does coinbase support limit orders? Can't find it anywhere.

Could you name some pros &amp; cons with Gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:07:13
Yep. Also download [Bread wallet]( for iOS or [Mycelium wallet]( for Android and transfer the bitcoins from Coinbase to your wallet.
Or secure your bitcoins in a better way, buy a [Trezor]( or [Ledger Nano S]( hardware wallet and transfer your bitcoins from Coinbase to your hardware wallet.
Good luck!

Yeah, they've had way too much problems today but eventually I got in.
The only thing worrying me is that if bitcoins in the future would skyrocket to even higher levels and I would like to withdraw some of the bitcoins to use some of the gains, I know coinbase wouldn't be the exchange to go to as they seem to never be able to handle all the traffic that they usually get during all-time-highs like this.
I'll need to find another exchange that's more stable and that has okay fees and a good reputation.
Oh, and also, if you're buying alot make sure you buy yourself a hardware wallet to transfer your bitcoins from your Coinbase account to it to secure them. Trezor or Ledger Nano S are the ones that people recommend.

There are no hidden fees. You'll always see the total amount that you're about to pay. But there are transaction fees and they are relatively high right now.
Also, you don't need to do this but I advice you to do a bank wire transfer to Coinbase instead of using a credit card. It's cheaper to begin with. When you've done that you can move the money from Coinbase to Gdax (which is also owned by Coinbase, you just use the same account that you have on Coinbase to login). Moving it from Coinbase to Gdax is completely free. When you've successfully moved the money to Gdax you can buy bitcoins with no fee by placing a limit order. This is slightly more difficult but it's extremely easy to learn if you're willing to. Just YouTube it! :)

I'm interested in buying IOTA but I'm not sure what wallet to use for it. I'm on OS X/iOS, got any recommendation for a good software wallet? What wallet do you use if you don't mind me asking?
My plan is to eventually buy a Trezor and store my BTC there. Not sure how I would safely store IOTA though.

What exchange can I use now when coinbase is down? I'm in Europe.
