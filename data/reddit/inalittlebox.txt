Yes I think so too.
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:22:53
Don't you think it will first go back to +/- 6.600? It would make a perfect triple bottom.
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:37:43
First small dump, then moon.

She'll probably spend it all on fillers and new titties. Profit will be gone before you know it.
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:58:14
Why would it be crashing again? I don't think it will go lower than about 7.400 anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:57:31
I had expected it to test the 7.560 mark again and maybe touch 7.590 and then drop to a point on the extrapolated ascending line/staircase that was formed before the last 'pump'. But anyway, we'll see. Right now it seems likely it won't even retest 7.560 again before it dumps.

It's ok Bitcoin, you can do this...
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:22:33
Tripple Bottom, here we come!
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:58:18
Yes because buy high sell low is the way to go.
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:32:28
Indeed, we had to learn it the hard way :(.
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:24:17
Bijna ;-). 
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:50:56
Yes that might be a good idea. Currently I'm trading CFD's though.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:39:26
Yesterday. Sorry you mist it m8.
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:49:02
That's pretty pessimistic.
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:03:12
Hmm very curious as to what this day will bring. The market seems more hesitant than I thought it would be but maybe that's a good sign somehow.
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:30:49
Change is in the air.
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:54:53
Here we go.
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:41:51
They get it through? You're Dutch aren't you?
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:02:20
It does seem to be a remarkably strong support line.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:03:13
Good for you. I should have done the same. I already had a weird feeling about this...
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:20:01
Yes that's double torture.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:47:15
@_date: 2018-06-03 08:37:54
No we're gonna do this slowly but steadily for once.
Edit: probably 3 to 4 more hours till the next pump. Just my guess.
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:55:39
Ok ok it takes a bit longer :).
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:28:33
The bears were wearing bull costumes.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:23:31
Make up your damn mind shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:47:42
One to two hours until next pump &lt;3.
@_date: 2018-06-03 09:02:02
I believe it's the real deal but I think first it will bounce off the new 'support' at 7.650/7.660.
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:48:08
I guess we don't really know what's going to happen until we're at 500-ish.
Edit: Or @ 7.250?
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:03:28
Hmm I'm not sure if I'm optimistic still. Hoping for the best though.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:34:11
Well let's just all buy the bloody 6.600 dip and get this over with once and for all.
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:39:59
True. I meant a smallish pump though, to 7.800 or something. If it goes up, I'm happy, no matter how slow it goes. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:43:11
This is Bitcoin on mood stabilizers.
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:30:23
We're on our way to a perfect tripple bottom so cashing in is probably the best idea now, financially, if you bought in at 7.000 or above.
@_date: 2018-06-04 09:51:52
Right now I'm not touching this with a 10 ft. pole. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 20:18:58
Holy shit though, I'm new to bitcoin but this must be the most boring thing I've ever laid my eyes upon.
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:56:57
Buying the dip lol
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:35:18
Love how this sub is such a rich source of knowledge and information.
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:06:48
Yeah, if only...couple years down the road perhaps.
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:54:43
Not at the moment, no. Why?
