That guy, faucets, three weeks...my take: guy sure is dedicated. Not sold on authenticity but what the hell, I was $5 worth of inspired.

I rewarded the implied passion. I also get a kick out of your replies and completely agree with your statement. Keep up the good work :)

Rolls a dice, $0.25 per roll value. So rolling a 3=$0.75 etc etc

Thank you for that very informative read. Any Canadian specialists who can weigh in would be most welcome. I assume certain asset classifications would be matched cross-border. The tax implications here will be interesting.

Daaaaaaammmmnnn. it better be the best damn pizza in New York.
I'm tuning in to watch you eat it.

live...on bloomberg TV at 1145. check down in the comments, you can get a replay of the segment as well. (it's very short, Mr. Miller needs some bullet points that are easily digestible by John Q. Investor)

he provided proof. he flashed his QR code as requested and mentioned Reddit.
What more do you want?
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:53:22
good job on flashing the QR code, but there was a lack of pizza consumption.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:55:58
