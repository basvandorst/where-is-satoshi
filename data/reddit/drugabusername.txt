Glad to hear! 
And I understand your view on trading. I've failed a couple of times in the past and been frustrated. Actually I don't ever do trades daily. I probably *add* positions, or *change* positions a bit, and I don't make moves more than 1-3 times a month tops. I do however read and check charts / analysis almost every day because I'm fascinated by this market.

This doesn't make a bubble for Bitcoin. But people will get burned. Always jumping on when they see the price go up, and then panic selling instead of just waiting a year when it goes back down. If say 1000s of people did this and the the price multiplied then we might have an issue. Bitcoin is getting more and more mature with enough liquidity to grow in a healthy way (healthy for crypto at least).
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:43:24
No it doesn't. Supply and demand. It is beyond me that people compare market cap of a currency to the value of a company. It can be viewed and compared to, even called, an asset, but 1 BTC is not a 21 millionth share of any company.. It's a scarce digital currency. Pay Pal handles more money and more traffic. But it doesn't matter. 
Still congrats to Bitcoin and all users/hodlers on $4200+

BCH is basically an unnecessary coup. Bitcoin Core + Segwit + Lightning network + whatever else is implemented in the coming months = unstoppable. And then none of this will matter. 
However, we don't have to be naive. I personally do *not* hope Bcash wins because Roger Ver and what he has become and stands for etc. But still, if it became the best solution and was adopted 100% I would accept it. But that probably won't happen.

So you are saying I did right by selling my BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:40:39
Ugh, yes. Don't use Coinbase. I get that they make entry easy for people who hasn't been into crypto, but really?
The fee is a rip off, and Coinbase hasn't even been reliable when people needed it. You got Localbitcoins (sometimes you find traders taking 1-2% fees), Bitstamp (0.25% trade fee after you bank wire) and probably many more like it. 
I personally buy Bitcoin from a guy in my town who has near unlimited supply. He sells for market price. Should be possible to find someone close to you too. But localbitcoins is a great place to start (edit: to get in touch and trade with people nearby)
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:11:40
You're nervous because you made a decision. You should stand by it.
I had my whole portfolio outside of Bitcoin when it forked so I didn't even get any BCH to sell or hold. But staying rational is earning me a lot more money.

It's the same with Bcash in redards to replay ammirite? Most people will be safe with selling their coins in the fork aftermath without their btc being affected.

Absolutely agree. Hope you didn't seriously think that what I wrote was a conspiracy theory, or were you referring to the OP / general note?
As I said it need massive amounts of volume to be manipulated right now compared to other currencies in the market, but still possible to a slight degree if you have the funds (according to this Spoofy thing, as I don't have any proof on)

Ah, the good old downvoting. Great community!
Please elaborate on what you won't forgive him for?
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:57:11
Actually, some one *is* trying to do this. They have astronomical amounts of capital. Not your avarage whale. You know how much liquidity Bitcoin has now right? It's not affecting it as much as lower market cap altcoins. TOO many people just holding on to their coins / lost coins prevents a massive selloff. Also the market will probably be regulated in the future, although the liquidity will probably be in the trillions by then, so doesn't matter that much.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:15:17
For me it's funny *just because* of that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:56:10

@_date: 2017-08-11 16:32:03
It makes scamming possible if you let it happen, so I kind of agree. However all tools are in place for it to be very safe. And I use it all the time. People who aren't that reflective shouldn't use it, like with Craigslist or with anything like that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:13:18
Please elaborate
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:14:58
I'm not quite sure we are talking about the same thing here blabla1212. Market cap is an indicator of the liquidity, but of course it matter MORE that a lot of people don't have their coins for sale because of their mentally for it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:51:47
I mean different things. 12 months ago no one could really explain "staying rational" to me and make me actually understand it. This past year has been crucial experience to actually understanding how to not do big mistakes in a market like this. 
First: Don't be affiliated (i mean having positions) with anything if you don't understand it or its benefit / market potential. 
Second: If you're doing the right things in places you have a good confident feeling, then you don't have to worry about all the (forever expanding number of) places you are missing out.  You know what Bitcoin is right, and all the aspects of it? No? Okey go and learn more.
Third: I repeat, sort of; RESEARCH. Avoid gang mentality which happens to 99% of everyone here on reddit by the way. Do not listen to aaaanyone. You can listen to fish for ideas but *still*, you have to go research it to either debunk or realize something about a project's true potential. One day you'll browse these subreddits, because it is still fun, and then realize that this is sort of like a sports league to most people. They just choose sides, like in politics too. Once you've liberated yourself from that you have unlimited possibilities. 
I love Bitcoin Core, but I wouldn't be holding any if the whole market gave up upon it. That wouldn't happen overnight by the way, things would point in that direction.
Fourth: DIVERSIFY
Fifth: Never panic sell, but learn to differentiate unrational decisions and allowing yourself to let go of something you previously though was promising. This is difficult because for a lot of investments patience will pay of. Therefore it actually *looks* safer to hold forever, but then you aren't opening yourself up to being able to protect yourself from irreverisble crashes. It hasn't happened much in Crypto space but it *will* happen.
Sixth: Don't invest money you have any fucking emotional ties to. Money are numbers. Fuck it. 
Seven: Your friends might hate you out of pure jealousy and disgust if you end up actually making a lot of money. That is because people only care about their own success / failure instead of being inspired and learn.
Botton line: Yes kind of stick with BTC for now. But do not miss the enourmous oppurtunity that this once in a lifetime market is presenting you. My goal is to get as much Bitcoin as possible, but if I always just held my portfolio in Bitcoin I wouldn't have nearly as much BTC as I currently have.

That's were the community is splitting, although it seems like everyone who rooted for segwit2x are happy with bcash (it seems when you check in at r/btc at least). Making Bitcoin Core as good as it can be should be the goal, and since it's indeed possible with segwit and the upgrades it makes possible.. I don't see why a hard fork would replace it ALTHOUGH I believe this is a healthy process somewhat.
Also not everyone who supports a hardfork / segwit2x are miners who only cares about more fees. There are some big blockers out there who are long term fans of Bitcoin but believe in taking the power away from Bitcoin Core. But I don't really see how that would make things more democratic, as it seems to be all about the miners and their interests anyway.
Fortunately there is no need to worry as the market will sort this out. You'll *know* if Bitcoin Cash is replacing Bitcoin. You don't have to play russian roulette. BTC is *the* bitcoin, that is a fact, although it *might* change.

@_date: 2017-08-25 13:55:58
BCH is not more profitable. These things get adjusted. 
Bitcoin Cash is a block size increase but it doesn't matter if Segwit works as well or better in practice and people aren't willing to USE bch instead of btc. It's primarily a speculative asset. In the future? Time will tell, we also have a segwit2x fork coming.

If everyone held (meaning 90-100% of BTC owners), then no it wouldn't be a fraction of it's value. If 10% of the BTC that existed were the only ones on the market, manipulation would be near to none existent. I'm saying that a *certain* percentage is holding today and that has a positive influence on keeping the price from dumping 2013 style. Growth comes from increasing volume of new buyers / stupid money as they say. It's exceeding the supply. Not sure what you're saying, but I might be misunderstanding your point.

It could absolutely be fake. But also I'm confident that this happens. 2017, starting in the spring, has been a massive explosion in the altcoin market and a lot of people's introduction to crypto has been to look for the next 100X-in-a-month coin.
