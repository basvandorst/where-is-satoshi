I also received a complementary KeepKey and conducted a few transactions using it.  Some of my observations were already mentioned by Aussiehash. I was using software version 0.0.33 (Chrome extension), which had a few minor issues I sent on to their support team.  
The QR code it presents with its Receive address contains the Transaction Label "KeepKey Wallet", which would introduce taint. I suggested via their website that label be an option one could turn off.
Overall, I am very impressed with the device's design and ability to provide a very strong level of private key security.
