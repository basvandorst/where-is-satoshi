If you like to test some faucets, here are great lists of all kinds of crypto faucets

This page shows you the minimum and maximum amount you can get per faucet, so you can decide by yourself which ones you consider to be worth your clicks ;)

i cannot agree,  one AntminerU2 mines around 15000 Satoshi per day. I can get this with faucets per way easier just by clicking and writing captchas 2-3 times a day. I am approximately using 3x5min per day for this and I got way more out of that than just 15k Satoshi and it's not a big waste of electricity. It's just the difference that using faucets is an active procedure and mining is passive and simply more comfortable.

Faucets checked and compared, quite useful, you can check how much time which faucet will cost you.

hey thanks, so if the most profitable is TRC I'll get paid in TRC? Or will they convert it and pay me in BTC?

Those aren't faucets, you have to do something. I want only want to list simple classic faucets.

so i cant simply start Multibit and send what I had there to my new blockchain wallet?

I have in one folder a wallet.cpp and a wallet.h from bitcoin-qt times.
And in another folder a .wallet file
Is it possible to still use bitcoin-qt ?

How did you export the keys?
I have tried that, I exported the private keys from Multibit and got 3 files:
In Electrum I get prompted with choosing a wallet, so I simply name it somehow.
Than "What kind of wallet do you want to create?"
I can choose 
- Standard wallet
- Wallet with 2fa
- Multi-Signature Wallet
- Watch Bitcoin Adresses
So I tried Standard Wallet
and than:
"Do you want to create a new seed, or to restore a wallet using existing seed?"
- Create a new seed
- I already have a seed
- Use public or private keys
- Use a hardware device
so I chose Use public or private keys
than I try to open the from Multibit exported blabla.keys file
and I can see a key, but the "Next" Button remains grey. I can only click Back. What the heck did I do wrong :D ?
