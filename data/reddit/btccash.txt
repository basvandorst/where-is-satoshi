Shit. I didn't even think about my username. I created this name several years ago. Roger must've stolen it from me. For the record, I own no Bcash. Sold it all and have no plans of getting back into that.

If you would have told me a year ago that in 12 months, Microsoft would be accepting Bitcoin and the price would be $360 I would say you were on crack.

What I got from reading this thread is that I should make a bigger effort to talk about how Bitcoin is inflation proof when I promote it. That is the single biggest advantage that banks just can't touch.

Also, remember if something better comes along, it can be adopted into Bitcoin. The protocol can be updated with a majority consensus.

The fiat scam as we know it today has only been around 100 years. By 2140 (the year when the last bitcoin is made) perhaps we will have an even better form of money. That is a looong way off. I'm not concerned.

Butterfly Labs is NOT a good company. If you decide to mine, pick a better company to do business with.

Its a very good and informative article. Mostly accurate except for this sentence. "There are also many bitcoin fans who see the currency as an antidote to the inflationary tendencies of central banks, although this argument for bitcoin is misguided." He doesn't explain why he thinks its misguided. Also, in the end he says most people should "probably not" buy bitcoins right now saying it's still too complicated  and volitile for the average user.

Just because you made the mistake of buying an Iphone doesn't mean you can't have the app freedom of an Android.

 Store your wealth in gold, stocks and bonds. Use bitcoin to make commerce easy and hedge against possible failure of the dollar.
