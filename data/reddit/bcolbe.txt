I'm building a site that does a lot of what you're talking about and has integrated tipping. It is still a little crude at the moment as I'm just getting it going (put it online earlier this week). Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think!
If you need some extra motivation I'm tipping new users that post too!

I think its a sign of growth and maturation in the community.

It's not a clone, but I built and just put online a site that has reddit-like features and integrated tipping. 
I'm still working on making tipping easier/more fluid, but it's a start.

Well, on the bright side when people start telling tough guy stories, you can be like "Yeah, well this one time in prison..." and pretty much trump them all.

One of the guys from coinalytics came to the most recent Seattle bitcoin meetup, seemed like they had a good thing going on. I'll be interested to see what people do with it.

Fair enough, that paragraph doesn't accurately describe what I was trying to convey. Will edit it out.
Either approach can and will be considered for the contest.
edit: spelling.

This is taken directly from [the Wikipedia page on him](






I'm not familiar with all the details on it, but from an outsider's perspective it looks like he got caught in a legal grey area in the financial/technical frontier that is digital currency. 
With early bitcoin it was tough to say how it should be treated. Some people didn't consider it actual money, no precedents had been set, and there hadn't been much in the way of legal guidance from government entities. It looks like the federal government was looking to define some boundaries for bitcoin, and Charlie got caught in the middle of that. 
Now there could be more to it than that, but that's my understanding.

Sarcasm, this guys got it!
It can be a difficult thing to convey over the internet, well done!

Just put the meta tags into [Backed.io]( earlier this week. Works pretty well and could be part of a new model for monetizing quality web sites.

The idea behind this is pretty cool. It allows you to maintain multiple personas under the same account. It's a common problem when it comes to the way tips and what not are implemented elsewhere. I don't necessarily connect my financial account with everything else i do online.
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:39:02
Came here to say the same thing...
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:39:44
Good luck in there.
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:43:08
I feel like you'd be a good fit for my new site.

Are they accepting Bitcoin now? I've been looking for some places in Seattle that accept Bitcoin, would like to give them my business.
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:50:39
It definitely does look like there is some serious vote manipulation going on here. However I have no association with Coinkite and my comment is all my own. I genuinely think its a cool idea. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:10:10
Not necessarily, it just depends on the idea and how they plan on implementing it. What I basically meant to state was:
If the idea is donate to charity, we'll just donate to charity. Otherwise we'll just send it to the winner.

I'll give you a short example of something that could win the contest but would require sending the 1 bitcoin to someone:
[1BTC] Build 4 New Bitcoin Nodes And Distribute Them
The new Raspberry Pi 2 has a 1GHz quad-core processor as well as 1GB of RAM (up from 512mb).
These specs make the the Raspberry Pi 2 a viable candidate for running full-nodes, of which the bitcoin network is generally deemed to be in need of.
My proposal is that the 1 bitcoin is used to build 4 new bitcoin nodes with Raspberry Pis. I will then run one of these out of my house and distribute the three others to fellow Backers that are looking to support the network.
The cost breakdown is as follows:
* Raspberry Pi 2 - $35
* Memory Card 64 GB - $20
This comes out to roughly $55 per full-node, which means four would run us about $220, roughly the value of one bitcoin at the moment. 
more details...
I'm obviously not eligible to win the contest, but that is an example of something that would be worthy of winning the 1 BTC reward, could be deemed as awesome by the community, and would require sending it to the contest entrant/winner in order to be implemented.
Now we're fully aware that whoever wins could still just run off with the bitcoin and there isn't much in the way of recourse if that does happen. Still, its a chance we're willing to take.

I thought it was a pretty funny take on Bitcoin, or at least one of the more original I've seen yet.
