This isnt Fight Club. Why do you think the banks will collapse in the developed world? Bitcoin can be shut down by pulling power from the top 3 mining orgs - if bitcoin threatens the financial power of govs they will kill it. They can also block traffic to the mempool and make use and mining illegal.
I like the fantasy of bitcoin, but realistically the powers that be will kill bitcoin, and its users, to preserve their power.

You are posting youtube links, and talking about education. Are you serious? Do you get your education off youtube? No wonder you dont know what the real world is like. Everything I said is true, explain how govs cant block bitcoin protocol using packet inspection, explain how shutting off mining cartels wont cripple it.
Jesus, do you even know how bitcoin works? If you do its easy to see how a state actor could prevent its citizens from using it...

Mr. Youtube University. OK buddy, keep thinking you're highly educated. LOL. You do realize, everyone is laughing at you, right?

Govs can stop torrents. Its not possible to torrent at my work due to blocking at the protocol level. Govs can do it too but free countries dont atm. Bitcoin is similar. If the tide turns they will.

Yeah but use some common sense. No real news media has reported that. Someone LARPing on the internet doesnt mean anything.

Nothing, because such a scenario would never happen. No country is moving to bitcoin. I don't know how many drugs were involved in thinking up that inspired scenario, but it will never play out in real life.

99.9% wash trading between bots. These statistics are meaningless.
Also, daily Forex trading is above 5 trillion. A day. The yearly volume of a bluechip stock like MSFT is also above 2 trillion, per year. 
So without the wash trading, bitcoin real trading is less than 1% of a stock like MSFT trading volume, per year. There is a long ways to go.

Wow a btc atm. That alone justifies a mcap of 65 billion. So impressive. Watch that machine for 24 hours as nobody uses it. Adoption.

Uh yeah .. a bitcoin ATM opened in some 3rd world country, ohhh must be 100 bn mcap worth ... or not. Bitcoin is something but the current market cap is hilariously high. Try 1 billion then we see.

Those exhanges are literally dead. Those numbers mean nothing as there is no buyers for the arbitrage. The idea that in "some foreign" exchange an idiot is waiting to buy at 7100 is hilarious. Use some common sense.

This is good for bitcoin.

I took a shit, divided into 21 million pieces. There are less shit pieces than millionaires, ergo they are worth 1millon.
This is bitcoin logic.

You're barely literate. Your financial advice has been noted, and discarded.

Is this pasta or weaponized autistic larping? Wtf man.
