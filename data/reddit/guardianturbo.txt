Hmm. I'm wary to do that with this person's [account]( of depositing funds and not being able to withdraw it out...

Yep. Both passport and drivers license. I actually tried a small transfer to see what would happen. It looks like I successfully withdrew some ETH out. So maybe that '$0 withdrawal limit' just means there is no limit. Which makes the case of whatever happened to that fellow I had linked to kinda strange but whatever I guess.
Now what I had done was sent some ETH to my gatehub wallet. Since I believe there was zero fees for both the withdrawal and deposit on the respective exchanges I sent the exact minimum amount for the deposit. But looking up my transaction hash on the blockchain explorer I see a ETH amount under 'fee'. I worry if this means my transfer did not in fact meet the minimum amount required for a Gatehub deposit. Since I'm still quite new to the scene, I'm not sure if I'm reading this information right...

You were able to deposit and withdraw without the use of the settings screen? Also my GDAX account specifically has a withdrawal limit of $0, with the 'apply to raise limit' button linking to the settings screen. Were you able to get through this process while working around the settings screen or did you not have this limit on your account to begin with?? thx

Ok I see. That's something I should have looked into before trying to move funds. Thanks for the info.
