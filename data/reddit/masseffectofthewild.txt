Thanks ima look into it.

So many things wrong with this sentence. I don't even know where to start. 
1. when did I say that NO ONE is using it for retail? Why the fuck do you have to constantly change my argument? Do you see how fucking retarded it is, that you only respond to arguments that I didn't even make? 
2. One piece of evidence &gt; literally no evidence. Feel free to prove me wrong and show me those retailers that have started accepting bitcoin recently. 
3. No, not just steam. The darknetmarkets as well. Ya know, the places that literally have bitcoin life.  The place where all of this bullshit gets set aside and they just use the coin that works the best. 
4. Bitpay literally tried to raise their minimum amount from $5 to $100. 


Instead of acting like a bitch and posting questions like this, why don't you just prove me wrong? It would be so fucking easy. Yet you still refuse. I wonder why.

You know you are insane when the only thing you can say about news like this is "shills are around and spreading false information".

@_date: 2018-01-01 00:37:00


Here you go again, more fallacies. I never said that literally no one was using it as a currency or store of value, only that adoption is going down. Not non existent, GOING DOWN. Big difference, please learn to read.


Which ones, and have they seen an increase lately or a decline?


I haven't seen anything new here in months. Is there something I'm missing?


Idk If you noticed, but retailers and gambling sites are dropping bitcoin right now because it is not usable. That's what I meant when I said adoption is going down.


Did you read that article? It's still basically just a test and lightning is not usable by people currently. 


What kind of mental disability do you need to have to continuously change my argument into the only one you can debate against? Dude you are lost as fuck.

@_date: 2018-01-01 17:11:59
I know what your argument is. It's just that it's half innacurate and half meaningless.


No, they don't. You listed several metrics, and some of them are DECLINING. Payments processors are going down. Retailers are going down. Gambling sites are decreasing. I'm sure you are just going to ignore this paragraph, because of that crazy cognitive dissonance you have.
So ya, how about you just stop lying and making shit up. Or at least point to the evidence of those metrics going up like you say they are.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:49:33
So it's literally unusable?
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:14:01
I'm talking about lightning network. If it's unusable, it's not more useful than anything else. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:49:42
Admit What? That I don't know exactly what all 22k txs are for? That's a bullshit argument. I literally think you can't read. 
You still refuse to discuss any specific thing because you don't actually know anything about any of them. Just fucking pick one or grow the fuck up and accept you don't know shit.

@_date: 2018-01-01 16:31:08

You are the perfect example of entitlement.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:26:22
Im gonna consolidate. 


Its not expensive. its $60, and you just made 22k. and that is the literal definition of being entitled, so ya maybe look it up.


becuase those are matured industries where the only place to compete is with features you mention. go ahead and open your own hardware wallet company and beat them. thats unfeasible right now, but you can go ahead and try.


it is the definition of bad. you cant think for yourself. you cant research for yourself. you literally need people to hold your hand. its terrible.


lol bullshit. no one could actually spend any time researching crypto and be as stupid as you. you must be a troll.


Then how come i actually understand this way fucking better than you? how come i can actually move my gainz around without needing someone to hold my hand?


I dont think you understand how incredibly insane this thread makes you look. Sometimes its hard to not be mean when people make it SOOO easy.


Why do they have to teach you how to use bitcoin?


Well congratz. most people here(including me), made more, with less, and actually know how to move our money around. ya know, like adults.


Usually people get embarrassed when they do shit this stupid. but im glad you wont, ill keep getting more comedy gold quotes like this one.


fucking lol

Dude, calm down. Learn some social skills. 
Read the comment that you originally responded to. He was saying that even with Trump in office, the checks and balances have stopped his from doing anything too crazy or cause too much harm. And the you responded with the "checks = wars" comment, which makes no fucking sense given the context. 
If you didn't understand what the original guy was getting at, you are an idiot.

What use cases are you talking about? Which of those use cases are actually being used? 
I know there are other suggested use cases, but right now everyone is just speculating on them being a thing in the future. 
Simple question. How would you or anyone use bitcoin right now? Please be rational.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:57:55
How is it not stupid? Anyone with half a brain will tell you bitcoin is only successful BECAUSE of people using. Looking at every past purchase, and regretting it, is basically fucking retarded.
See, unlike you, who probably bought in 3 months ago, and considers yourself a veteran, I have been actually using bitcoin since 2012. 
Go ahead and try to explain how this is a good thing to bring up constantly. Good fucking luck.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:59:14
I don't think you use hardware wallets. How would you use a Trezor that isn't a Trezor? How would you transfer bitcoins to it? Do you even understand how you transfer bitcoins on a real one? I really don't want to have to explain the whole thing.

Fuck off. "Lets save some time". You had nothing to respond with and so you defence is to say that because I'm not omniscient I can't be correct.
While forgetting that you literally said there are other use cases for bitcoin. So, you do claim to know. Or you don't understand what the word speculation means. Take your pick.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:12:55


No one uses it like that right now. That would be the absolute worst store of value in history.

@_date: 2017-12-04 01:20:23
You aren't just "asking a quedtion", you are JAQing off. You have an agenda and a point you are trying to make. 
And besides, asking that question to that specific comment is fucking stupid. He made one random prediction, in relation to people saying "it's too late to buy in" and you jumped on the "hurr durr speculation". It really doesn't make sense given the context, and if you want to say something just say it, don't beat around the bush.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:57:18
Ok. Sure. Still, the point is, and has been, that you don't need to trust a third party. 
If we are going to assume the person is completely ignorant, then it doesn't matter where you buy it from. One random guy could do the same thing, without altering the device, with a piece of paper.

Speculation that it will work in the future.

Dude grow the fuck up. Debate like an adult or gtfo. 
You are exactly what is wrong with bitcoin right now. Head in sand, won't debate, won't acknowledge problems. You say bitcoin doesn't need fair weather fans? Wtf? Do you seriously not understand the whole point of bitcoin? 
Ya bitcoin is in for hard times when the only people who debate for core are people like you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:28:41
Seriously these are the posts that worry me. He's only looking at the specific information that confirms his idea.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:56:07
When confronted you just put your fingers in your ears and throw insults. 
At this point you know you aren't thinking rationally. Keep sticking your head in the sand and just hoping.
I'm still here because I'm interested. If things change for bitcoin I will be back in. But for now I'll be happy getting out at 16k.

You are the one with a fallacy. You just assumed a bunch of things from his post, that he did not say.
He never said it couldn't go both ways. He never said it was impossible for him to miss out on gains. 


Not only is that incorrect, but he wasn't incorrect in his argument whatsoever. It's simple, if bitcoin crashes today, he misses out on Y. 


But that doesn't matter. He never said he couldn't miss out on gains. 
I don't think you know what a fallacy is.

No, you didn't. Stop lying to both of us. First you said my point of view was wrong, then you asked me a pedantic fallacies question, then you moved on to another strawman saying I was saying that in omniscient. Go re read you comments if you must. 


But I'll answer that now. Literally anything. Literally any reasoning to think any bitcoin is being used right now for anything other than speculation.


Yes, I don't think there is any evidence to point to actual use, but you can go ahead and show me some. But you don't actually have any I'm guessing, that's why you keep lying to both of us.
Here's a thought experiment for you:
Bitcoins price will fall because the dark side of the moon is pink. I know that doesn't make any sense, but you wouldn't believe my evidence anyways. So I'm just going to keep making this assertion without any reasoning, because I'm a child. I also won't stop responding because that would break my own cognitive dissonance.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:48


What was the other option? Just let everything go wrong forever and not do anything?

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:54:29
Should have known you are a conspiratard. Following your logic there would never be evidence for anything. 
Think about it, what evidence could i possibly point to and have you believe it, if you automatically assume this evidence is fake? 
Pure fucking retardation. Go read some debates, there is no fucking way you are an adult that has any experience with logical fallacies or debate tactics. 
Any rational person comes to a conclusion based on the evidence. They don't just pick and choose evidence to believe and not to believe. 
Literally knowing that a person as dumb as you is into bitcoin makes me want to get out.

Not just that it is speculative, but that the speculation has led it to a price higher than it's true value. 
The wording is only fair if you think it is overvalued right now.

@_date: 2017-12-31 03:38:37
I'm an extremist because you can't say even one use for bitcoin? Just because 1/22k txs is being used as a "currency", doesn't make it a practical use at all. 
I have a closed mind? You are literally looking at the unknown and saying "those must be other uses then speculation", without being willing to talk about it or even look for evidence to support your blind belief. 
You know the point here wasn't to say that literally all 22k are for speculation. But you are too much of a fucking child to move on to the actual argument. Thankfully for some there are a shit ton of people like you out there, so making money on the way to 19k this year was easy. 
Anyways, good luck. You're gonna need it if you're just blindly betting on core developers to deliver uses that are nowhere to be seen.

Even Putin could invest easily. No one can track his finances.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:40:49
And I clarified what I meant by adoption. We can use a different word if you want. 
But I specifically asked which metric you think points to actual use and not speculation. At this point you just gave up and won't continue. There is no winning here, just you sticking your head in the sand.
How about you just grow up a bit, and make good on one of your many "goodbyes". You don't want to debate more. I do. So just stop responding. It does no good for you unless you are a trolling child.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:08:32
I guess we are using the word adoption differently. All of those things are just speculation. You and I both know it. 
Actual adoption is going down while the price and speculation is going up.

Do I really need to link the logs to you? 


Apple to oranges.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:00:30
No, they can't. It simply won't work. But im guessing you don't actually know how one works or own one yourself. Maybe go read about it before you respond.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:49:19
You have no reason to think those logs are not him, except your own personal emotions. You just want to believe he is innocent/non violent, nothing else.
And then you call him naive. You must be a child.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:36:51
Then it's not a fallacy. Where was he incorrect? 
How could you possibly not understand what I was getting at?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:08:26
Why? I want to debate, and you are the troll here. I probably still own more btc than you. Seems like you belong in r/buttcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:17:27
You added even less than he did to the conversation.

You are full of shit. Either you knew your arguments were trash, so you tried to just insult him, or you are actually a child who thinks the better option was to insult someone instead of have a debate like an adult.
It's not too late, you can still respond to him with those same arguments you just made, and probably have an actual debate. Or don't, whatever.
All I know is that posting "no you're dumb you don't know anything", without baking up your statement, does no one any good (including yourself). It just makes you look like an ignorant pathetic child.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:35:46
I think it's pretty good, but just takes a few steps to perfect. I was recently using one for a small amount of crypto, here's what I did:
1. Reset the phone. You will need a aim card for this. 
2. Set it up using completely random info. Never give out the icloud email you create. Write down the info if you must. 
3. Download maxthon 5 browser. Set up uu mail. This gives you a proxy email that will forward to your real email, and can be disabled. 
4. Never use the device for anything other than sending/receiving, and maybe for exchanges that have apps.

 I love reading comments like this. Full of questions that aren't questions, and phrases like "and my understanding is", followed by a list of the most popular negatives aspects of bitcoin. 
We get it, you have an opinion on bitcoin and you are trying to rationalize yourself out of feeling regret. 
It might be worthwhile to read about the entirety of bitcoin, the negatives and positives. You night be surprised.

People usually don't buy a specific amount of bitcoin, they buy an amount in fiat, which is the more intelligent way to purchase. 
So if someone buys $10,000 dollars worth, and either gets 1 btc or 1,5 btc, that would be a difference of $50,000 later, which is something that someone would give af about.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:01:16
I mean I'm sure there was someone who fucked up and couldn't liquidate because they are tied to an exchange and always leave their btc there. But that's their fault, and isn't any different than stocks or current banking.

Ok, I get it, you literally can't read.
It's not bout whether you would buy stock, it's about whether you would sell. Stocks are in the same position you are implying bitcoin will be in, but still, people sell all the time to buy other shit, even though they could wait and have more money. You are trying to say no one will ever buy anything, which is false, and we have evidence for it. 
Please man, apply a little brain power to your comments from now on. It really weakens your point when you can't even respond with something that makes sense given the context.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:22:37

I tried.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:57:16

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:04:38
Ya I should have. Now every day I'm like " well my money will be in there tomorrow so I can just do it then" and then I wake up and the price is up 1k and it's still not it. I'm probly gonna just pull my money out and not buy any.

Ok so first off, almost everything in that article that separates stocks from a casino DO NOT apply to bitcoin. Seriously, did you read it, or just look for a title that goes along with what you are preaching?
Second, most of the differences are things that make fuck all difference. Who cares if you make your money in 10 mins at a casino and 10 years in investing. Still both are bets.

That is literally, the exact same thing. That calculated risk, is also known as a bet. no one said that "betting" requires poor odds. 
BET: an act of risking a sum of money on the outcome of a future event.
You are doing literally this. On bitcoin. That calculated risk, is still a risk, therefore this is a bet. Its not that complicated, stop trying to make it complicated to prove your invalid point.

The key word there is think. You THINK it's a good investment, bit dontnknow for sure. It's a bet. Just like everyone else. Maybe your intentions are different, but you are still betting on it.

Dude. Stop. Responding. In. This. Thread.
All of your responses lack any argument or debate points. It's fucking pathetic.
Either explain why people are wrong or get the fuck out. 
What good do your comments do? No one is going to change their mind based on a comment from someone who lacks the mental capacity to post an actual argument.

1. You aren't buying from "drug lords" on silk road either. If you think all dealers are drug lords or gangs you really need to grow up.
2. Dude, there are many ways. First one that comes to mind is a p.o. box. Shit some people get it delivered to where they work. Or people that get delivered to apartments where the apartments sort it. So many ways. Look it up.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:39:04
The same thing goes for eBay then too. And there are ways of avoiding giving your actual address.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:05:39
You really don't understand drugs. Most of the illegal drugs sold on silk road have a lower chance of addiction and OD than alcohol. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:41:38
You are obviously talking to people who understand the topic, while you do not. There is an entire market devoted to this, and yet what you think is "Naw that doesn't work". This shit is so easy to Google without making yourself look ignorant.
