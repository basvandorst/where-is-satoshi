How can I tell? at the bottom right of bitcoin qt I have a red bar and two orange bars. I don't see that last green bar .
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:20:39
don't worry i'm not getting fooled. I undertstand how far btc is ahead. However I also understand human greed and how markets work. A great opportunity to make some more Bitcoins ;)
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:41:32
I did this like 2 hours ago. I also restarted my PC and Bitcoin QT.
Doesn't really make sense, I don't understand why it's not working
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:57:40
It's working now for me on bitcoin core. I have never tried using bitcoin xt
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:07:30
I see what you mean. However my VPN used to work , they blocked it a few months ago.
I don't think the router has a firewall, but i'll check
Im going to change the port tomorrow to see of that works.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:18:28
yeah looks like it :( that would really suck. 
I'm going to give it another try tomorrow. thx for your help
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:10:41
Not sure what that means but the VPN as app on my Devices (Private internet access) . Its not installed on my router but on all my devices if that makes sense. 
I do have my own router in addition to the ISP, however I purposely connected my PC to the ISP's modem via ethernet, in other words the first one... doesn't that eliminate the need to forward twice?
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:47:27
I don't have a third party firewall. 
I use windows firewall.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:58:06
alright thanks for your help :) It's working now on Bitcoin core.  
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:21:12
Bittrex is awesome. I'm so glad I slowly started to empty my cryptsy account  few months ago.. I managed to get all of my bitcoins out just in time. 
Bittrex also has a great customer service, and they send withdrawals immediately (Most coins unless its a dead coin with a laggy blockchain)
@_date: 2015-06-21 02:43:16
epic response! gets right to the point
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:42:01
I love gambling with my holdings. Should have just bought litecoin and namecoin. Shits kicking off! 
I'm sorry for your losses. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:53:18
I can't use the old modem, UPC replaced it with the new one. 
They are basically forcing customers to use their new one.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:43:28
Got it.
Number of connections: 8 (In:0 / Out: 8)
and yes i'm running the latest version
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:23:12
that's very true. It's sad to see how little businesses are accepting bitcoins. Especially online markets and businesses. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 01:18:39
If you send BTC from your circle account to another address, they can link your identity to that other address you sent them to. 
After that you can just follow the bitcoins on the blockchain. So yes your bitcoins will be followed even if you are sending them from different wallets.
I stopped using circle when I wanted to order a pizza with bitcoins and circle didn't let me send the btc required because of the weekly limit. What a load of horsesh*t
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:52:40
I looked it up, it's not working.
My ISP is definitely blocking VPN's. I know this because my vpn still works on my iphone when i'm on 3g but not on wifi. It also stopped working on all my computers that are connected to the router. 
I'n not sure about the bitcoin ports, that would be kind of random
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:56:03
thank you :) yes it was my ISP's router. 
They basically don't allow static IP adresses anymore. 
I had to go through my other router and forward the ports twice. Thank you for your help!
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:12:47
also does it only work with bitcoin or can any alts be tipped? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 03:09:58
NMC is merge mined with bitcoin so it's not really off topic
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:30:24
i just got my changetip account today :) feels like this can actually change the way we use micro-payments! i'm super exited
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:23:15
Thank you very much ImStuckInMyRoom! So all tips automatically appear on my changetip profile page! that's awesome! thx so much for your help :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:28:34
You can forget about mining bitcoins.. You should probably take a look at Darkcoin or other X11 Pools. I still mine using my GPUS, here is what i do: 
Every now and then i switch between two websites for mining.
Most of the time I use:   You can mine the most profitable X11 coin and everything automatically gets converted to Nextcoin. 
Whenever I feel like mining Litecoins I use: 
The principle is the same here: you mine X11 coins which then get exchanged for LTC automatically. 
However i do prefer hashrate.org since Litecoin hashrate has skyrocketed way too much (back in the day i used to get 4 LTC for mining with my gpus) . 
Alternatively you could take a look at Feathercoin or Vertcoin. Good luck ;) 
PS: I also used to use LTCrabbit for mining litecoins, although their fee is quite high..
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:30:00
haha we havn't had sh*t yet this year . Trust me these small price moves over the year were nothing. AUAAUA is talking about a real spike, and he knows what he is talking about! my guess is we will be around 6000$ in a few months
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:21:51
I have to say I have been using Cryptsy since it came to us a bit longer than a year ago. I think they are doing a wonderfull job. Yes every now and then there are a few issues, however support has always been really fast to respond to my tickets and find a solution. I have had multiple problems on Cryptsy and all of them got fixed almost instantly. I highly doubt they are trying to pocket your funds.. They make CASH off every trade. Thats where the real money is at... Think about it , they almost have 400 different markets, I can only assume it's not easy managing the exchange. For what they are, and for the time they have been around, Cryptsy has been more than average in my experience... That being said , I never leave more than 5% of my portfolio on crptsy.... 
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:02:15
does anyone know if this works in Austria?
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:25:48
well i don't really care to be honest, im just trying to spread a good word for both of these coins which are clearly not scams. buy hey if everyone in this community has become too stubborn because they have lost a few btc here and there too bad i guess
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:26:35
i forgot to add. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:42:53
I tested their service and bought 60 Euros worth of btc last week. Works perfectly! Got instant access to my btc, so thats awesome. They do however require you to leave your phone number for identity verification...
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:13:42
No you do not need any personal information. That's partly what makes bitcoin so special. You can choose to give your information but you are not being forced depending on what services you want to use.
With bitcoin you have the possibility to be private if you know how to ;)
If you want to start using bitcoins I recommend using the HIVE WEB WALLET. They won't ask you for personal details and have a wallet for bitcoin and litecoin. 
If however you wish to buy bitcoins off an exchange, you usually have to leave your bank account and name or ID/Passport... If you want to stay a anonymous buyer then look for a lamassu bitcoin ATM near you :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:22:35
Hey there! 
Here is my opinion: Bitcoin is a revolutionary new decentralized Protocol which enables wealth transfer over the internet. 
In other words Its kind of a payment processing network, with it's own currency on top, and everything works by itself eliminating the need for middle men! 
You will have to do your own research about bitcoin, I found out about bitcoin around 2 years ago...I believe it may be the most important and most revolutionary innovation since the interet. 
As to changetip, they are a company which enable you to send micropayments in bitcoin (or millibitcoin which is a fraction of a bitcoin). Nice to see you have received a tip, if you want to withdraw it, you need to get a bitcoin wallet first ;)
@_date: 2015-01-19 03:32:30
I wouldn't recommend buying mining shares. Think about it. The hashrate increases at such an exponential rate that miners become less ''powerfull''every day. In other words your mining shares will earn you less btc every day and your earnings will decrease exponentially. On top of that  do you know how many mining shares there are or how many cryptsy plans on adding in the future? The more they add the less yours is worth...
If you want to speculate with your btc and try to increase them I recommend buying and holding some namecoins, or maybe some nxt. But I can definitely tell you mining contracts are not the answer.
They might be on the rise right now, but don't get fooled ;)
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:18:19
Its remarkable to see how many idiots are here , too bad for you if you're not even gonna take a look haha. 
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see whats going on, 
but yeah remind me again when these two alts hit new all time highs one day.... let me guess: you're one of these idiots that bought bitcoin at 1200$? well let me remind you why you didn't buy any btc when they were cheap: you're a blind n00b that buys into things when everyone does , at the top 
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:14:39
Thx ImStuckInMyRoom! How can I collect this tip? sry for being such a noob haha.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:27:30
just buy a few bitcoins ;) alternatively you can speculate on altcoins, just make sure to ignore all those scams like Paycoin. Here are a few interesting coins in my opinion: 
Namecoin, Peercoin, NXT, and possibly XRP to keep an eye on.
Remember: When bitcoin suddenly becomes highly overvalued, Altcoins tend to rise in price and might offer a higher return ;)
@_date: 2016-01-04 21:30:05
all of these websites also offer to sell Bitcoins to Euro or USD. then you withdraw the euros or usd to your bank account
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:35:19
This is awesome. Im going to have to order one of these soon!
@_date: 2016-01-28 12:45:35
I don't understand why everyone is complaining about uphold. I trasfterred 1 BTC out and it worked just fine. My withdrawal instantly showed up on the blockchain and got fully confirmed in less than 30 mintues. Im fully verified. If you want to use a service like uphold.com you need to provide id. It's as simple as that.
I have withdrawn Euros to my bank account several times wihtout a problem either. Took them 2-3 Days
I love uphold. It's such an easy way to get in and out of Bitcoin at market rate
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:51:52
I have sold a few Bitcoins using your service. The rate is always lower than everywhere else... by quite a lot actually. But it's very convenient because I get the money sent to my bank account the very same day :)
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:35:32
All of these will work:
 //  //

edit: Actually I just read your message again and it seems you want to use a credit card to cash out? I would try with uphold or bistamp
@_date: 2016-01-06 01:23:49
I sell bitcoins for euros on coinimal. they send the euros to my bank account
@_date: 2016-01-04 21:28:36
think of it like sending a e-mail. 
Create an account at kraken. Go the the deposit page. Copy the bitcoin address.
Next open coinbase and select withdraw/send bitcoins. 
Paste the address you copied and hit send ;)
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:26:48
because few people want to spend their bitcoins at these low prices
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:18:34
I am also in Austria.
I have never had any issues and i'm with bank austria.
You can buy bitcoin at 
Your bank wont stop the transfer because bitcoin.de operates peer to peer instead of taking your funds like bistamp and co....
I think you can buy up to 1500 Euros without getting verified
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:15:47
thats genious thank you i had never thought of that
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:59:40
nope. a store of value which has been gradually increasing since over 5 years
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:13:09
Circle and Coinbase collect information about what you do with your Bitcoins. 
Since every bitcoin transaction is on the blockchain they can find out what you are using your Bitcoins for pretty easily. 
It might be better to buy Bitcoins without an ID from an ATM or localbitcoins.com..
Alternatively you can use Circle to buy coins and use  to shift your btc to LTC and then back to Bitcoins and have the coins sent to another wallet like hive:  before sending them to their destination
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:04:14
under recent activity you can view all recent transactions. 
If you press on the dollar amount you sent it will show you the recipients Bitcoin address and the amount you sent ;)
@_date: 2015-07-12 12:59:56
I stopped reading coindesk about 6 months ago when they really started talking crap asif they knew what would happen
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:03:21
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:45:39
Anycoin direct is awesome, have had several transactions, no issues whatsoever
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:31:06
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:32:30
I think circle is great. So is 
They both broadcast transactions instantly and have very little downtime
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:40:05
You are absolutely correct. A lot of people in this sub have a very narrow way of thinking. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:43:15
I think robness is talking about the market cap and USD price. Not the price of a particular coin towards bitcoin. It's true that in a way the market cap and USD price are pegged to Bitcoin's USD value. 
When bitcoin's price goes up so does the USD price for most altcoins. that's because their value is calculated using the current bitcoin/USD price.  
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:28:25
bittrex still works for me
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:37:51
Stockmarkets and banks closed on weekends. 
Bitcoin users unaffected. 
I can't imagine people using bitcoin to buy stuff in stores anyway. I see it as a store of value. 
I don't mind waiting 3 hours untill my coins arrive in my cold storage. 
By the way this won't last forever... the devs will fix this sooner or later. Also once it's fixed once an for all, it will show how resilient Bitcoin really is to these kind of things 
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:19:30
Awesome, thank you very much!
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:52:01
I would not be so sure about that. I agree that Litecoin's future is uncertain at this point, however you cannot ignore the facts. here is a logarithmic chart comparing BTC/USD LTC/USD and LTC/BTC
If Bitcoin does continue to fall, which it could, so will ltc. However it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out whats going to happen if bitcoin recovers, just take a look at the charts
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:49:30
Remind me if/when Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs ;)
I'd be willing to bet NMC and LTC will still be around stronger than ever...And I have put my money where my mouth is. I hold way more NMC and LTC than BTC
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:06:16
Dogecoin seems to have become pretty popular these days, I assume it's because it's merge mined with litecoin.
I used to own 2.5 Million dogecoin but I lost the password to my wallet file :( That being said im not going to buy anymore just because im quite pissed. However it's definitely an interesting coin because I believe more than 90% of all coins have already been mined....
Im surprised you haven't heard more about Litecoin. You should do your own research :) here is a nice chart showing the volume of cryptos. 
As you can see Litecoin is the only other crypto out there with liquidity.
Not many people know about Namecoin...That's because people don't need it yet. When Bitcoin was under a dollar, no-one really needed it.
It's kind of the same with namecoin. Decentralized domain names are the future. With the internet getting more censored day by day, I wouldn't be surprised if .bit domains suddenly became popular. As a result, Namecoins would become very valuable.
Thank you for the tip :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:36:03
He should be able to get verified within the next 24 hours on multiple exchanges. It will take a few business days until he has all the Bitcoins. If you don't receive your bitcoins by next Sunday you might want to check up on the guy again ;)
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:37:55
Bitcoin does sound pretty perfect for this kind of transaction. 
The scammer will need to sign up and get verified with one or more big bitcoin exchanges. Depending on where he lives
I recommend: 
-    
-   
Once he is fully verified he should be able to get 5k worth of Bitcoins no problem. 
Bitcoin Core is a bit slow, it's probably going to take ages to sync, you might want to look into
- 
- 
These lightweight clients will let you receive and securely store your Bitcoins almost instantly.... They don't require the entire blockchain to be downloaded for them to work...
Make sure you use a good password and make a backup of your wallet. (if you are using Bitcoin Core the wallet.dat file can be found here on windows:
press start and type %appdata% and hit enter. the wallet.dat file should be in the bitcoin folder. Go ahead and copy paste that file)
Now send the scammer one of your Bitcoin receiving addresses and wait for the funds to arrive. If they don't, well thats up to you ;)
Once he sends the Bitcoins there is no going back..If you want to sell your Bitcoins for Fiat currency then you can use one of the following exchanges I mentioned earlier.
I recommend keeping a few if you can afford to loose the money as an investment. 
Hope this helps 
 
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:43:11
I have heavily invested in Namecoin and Litecoin. 
Make no mistake, if Bitcoin recovers so will ltc and nmc.
Namecoin offers a decentralized domain name system utilizing .bit doimains...You can read more about this on the namecoin website. It was the first Altcoin ever to be around and was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the same person that invented bitcoin.
Litecoin is currently the second crypto currency of choice because it has liquidity and a good name. If Bitcoin goes back up to new all time high's, people will get greedy again, thinking bitcoin is too expensive. That's where litecoin comes into play. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:24:16
I have no issues logging in using authy. 
it's way more reliable than sms 2 factor. 
When you get back into your account you should switch to authy or google authenticator 
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:54:13
yeah I was going to say this too. If you don't plan on keeping the Bitcoins you could just sign up to circle and have your coins be sent to one of those receiving addresses...
@_date: 2015-11-17 12:59:05
Ok that's a lot of questions! let me try and answer those:
If you go to  you can click every section to find out more about Solarcoin.
I'm not sure where you found a link to the source code when looking for the technical details? 
If it's the specs you were looking for here they are:
- 100% Proof of Stake using the POST algo. with a 2% inflation rate. (SLR used to be mined using scrypt proof of work before being replaced by Proof of Stake)
- In total there will be 98 Billion Coins in existence. ( At the moment there are approx. 34 Million in circulation). The Solarcoin foundation holds the other 97.9 Billion coins and has been distributing SLR to solar energy claiments since over 2 years now :) 
It's basically a system where you have to trust the Solarcoin foundation won't do any harm. But from what I have seen so far, I think its safe to say they are trustworthy people. 
- the target block rate is 1 Min/block.
Yes the volume is down today but don't get fooled by that. I have been involved with SLR since the very beginning and the volumes do get a lot higher from time to time. 
I don't see an issue with the spending incentive, Bitcoin doesn't have a spending incentive does it? 
Yes it's truly sad to see a member of the Solarcoin community leave.
Price manipulations are nothing new in the crypto world. Even Bitcoin with a market cap of 5 Billion dollars is tiny on a global scale and can still be manipulated with enough capital ;) 
I remember early bitcoiners leaving BTC because it was manipulated too back in the days.. 
But if you look at the all time chart you can clearly see that even though a lot of Solarcoins have been dumped we are still more than 5x higher than 2 years ago... so it's reasonable to say that user left with a decent profit. 
I like to think that Solarcoin is very special in it's own way. You see all these other crappy altcoins out there and they and people are actually paying for them... SLR is so much more than just some other altcoin, it's a 40 Year project that could help change the world.
The Solarcoin foundation is not an energy company, at least not that i'm aware of. The coins currently in circulation were mostly mined over the last 2 years. A very small portion of these coins have also been claimed from the foundation. 
Since everything on the blockchain can be verified publicly, you can check the Solarcoin foundations reserve addresses anytime :
 
@_date: 2015-03-14 21:20:11
I have used cloudbet a couple of times however i don't think i ever withdrew more than 1 btc. Good luck
@_date: 2015-03-24 11:48:17
Altcoins are your gateway to bitcoin. If you play it right you can make a bunch of btc with alts
I recommend mining drk and exchanging the mined coins for nmc. Namecoin is a good speculative bet! if bitcoin goes back up ther is no reason for namecoin to stay at these low levels
@_date: 2015-11-17 13:33:07
ok that's fine. 
Awesome, make sure to claim your Solarcoins if you do ever get those generators :)
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:37:26
It's not like other Altcoins out there. 
First of all it uses the Proof of Stake Time algo.
Secondly it incentivizes the use of Solar Energy around the world. 
People who have Solar Panels can claim SLR from the Solarcoin Foundation. The Solarcoin community really has a vision and they are determined to make it work :). I have been part of the Solarcoin community right from the start and I love everything about slr
@_date: 2015-11-24 11:30:14
today the SLR trading volume is above 1000$ . Just saying. it's not always low ;)
@_date: 2015-11-06 06:17:03
Because shapeshift is in the business of making money. 
A lot of the coins that are unavailable are probably a pretty good buy right now, especially namecoin ripple ect... They are all pretty much at an all time low. If Bitcoin does start to rally again they know they can sell them way higher ;)
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:16:05
No problem! Sry I just realized I didn't answer all of your questions...
To this date I don't know of any wallet that supports multiple Coins. 
You will probably be better off storing them separately. 
NXT uses brainwallets that's pretty cool...
Personally I would not go as far as buying 10 different altcoins, I would just buy more of the more reputable ones. But it's up to you :)
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:44:53
It it very possible with the blockchains transparency, just hard to imagine. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 12:05:55
-apparently you understand nothing about 100% Proof of Stake. 
NXT had to be distributed to those willing to risk their Bitcoins..
-NXT's maketing sucks, It's not about the marketing, and more about innovating using the blockchain technology. 
-Tell me, how much Venture Capital did bitcoin receive in it's first Year? ZERO because at the time it was very new and people were calling it a Scam from all over the place...
@_date: 2015-11-17 11:47:28
haha alright! At least take a look at the video and let me know what you think about it! I know it's looks very unprofessional because of the voice and how it was made but the coin is awesome
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:54:25
I agree. I have been involved with bitcoin since more than 3 years and I think Altcoins are fundamental to bitcoins success . There are way too many people here who don't know what they are talking about
@_date: 2015-03-14 21:23:31
nice :) I think you will get your btc, cloudbet always seemed pretty reputable.
what did you bet on?
@_date: 2015-03-05 11:28:44
I would keep an eye on Namecoin, Litecoin, NXT, and possibly XRP... Some very interesting stuff. I like to think nmc and ltc are safe bets as long as bitcoin is around because namecoin is merge mined with bitcoin and just had it's block halving and litecoin has trading volume and liquidity. 
If you go back in time you will see that ALTS tend to spike with bitcoin and go back down over time... I expect the same to happen when/if bitcoin reaches new all-time highs.
A lot of people here seem to hate Altcoins especially NXT for some reason.. You should really loook into NXT, some very cool stuff going on over there.
@_date: 2015-03-14 19:44:42
Bitcoin uses proof of work to validate transactions. This means miners do ''proof of work''(mining)
One day peercoin came along and introduced proof of stake. (as a hybrid proof of work/proof of stake. 
Proof of stake is a different approach in which users can leave their client open and forge coins using their existing stake. The more coins you have the more powerful your forging power will be... 
NXT has a very interesting approach: All coins have already been created. Every transaction costs 1 NXT. Forgers (those who support the network (usually big stakeholders)) verify transactions instead of miners. As a reward they get the transaction fees contained in the block which was found. 
Its basically what bitcoin would look like if every btc was already mined 
So yeah you can mine any other coin and sell for NXT or just buy some its up to you :)
edit: go ahead and download the NXT client and post me your account id. I can send you some coins so you can try it out
@_date: 2015-10-06 22:36:57
Do you really think it's coincidence that they raised their fees to 0.5 % just before all of this ''bad news''.
They sure know how to squeeze out as much money as possible from everyone before getting out ;)
@_date: 2015-11-17 11:38:32
No worries :) 
I posted on rbitcointv after posting here, that's why I changed it when posting there... 
Is there a way I can change the title of my Post?
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:26:31
no need to worry. Shapeshift is a reputable company. You will get your money back if something goes wrong. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:06:15
The only scam here is your dirty comments. if you can't appreciate a nice crypto, or even take 10 min of your time to look into it, you deserve to miss out
@_date: 2015-11-08 15:58:59
well then you should take a look at Solarcoin. Currently 70th in market cap and rising. I have been watching it for over 2 years, seems very promising

what you just said is true for 95 % of all Altcoins, maybe 98%.
I think you don't really understand alts. It's not about them ''winning'' or being better than bitcoin (or more expensive).
Im sure satoshi created namecoin just as a pump and dump? Maybe if offers nothing new? WRONG. Same with NXT, and I do like litecoin as means of speculation. 
Bitcoin is KING, there is no point in denying that, however when overall bitcoin sentiment is bullish for a longer period of time, ALTs tend to spike and offer more return in BTC. Its just how it works. As bitcoins market cap becomes bigger the USD value of ALTS starts to increase until finally the BTC value also goes up. 
Anyway i'm not trying to say Litecoin or some other alt will overtake bitcoin... I like to think one day bitcoin will be above 8000 dollars which would cause another altcoin boom.

I would pump the shit out of some random altcoins like ripoffcoin or bitbar or litebar just for fun haha

well it might be time to look into nxt. It's 100% proof of stake so no need for mining ;)
I still use my old gpus to mine drk and convert it straight to NXT

lucky you! they are probably just trying to make you cancel your withdrawal so you place a few more bets and lose your btc... 
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:52:38
The best thing you can do is buy a few litecoins/namecoins and I believe NXT is pretty interesting. That way you are hedging a few of your btc without taking such a great risk... You can simply store your Altcoins in cold storage like you do with your BTC. I recommend hedging 20% of your portfolio, Altcoins are pretty low right now, If BTC recovers, which I beleive it eventually will , i'm pretty sure NMC/BTC and LTC/BTC will spike aswell. If all goes well you could end up with twice the amount of bitcoins ;)
I wouldn't daytrade with so many btc.... That's a quick way to lose your money

I have been using circle for quite a while now. Never had any issues. Have bought more than 8 bitcoins with them already
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:59:12
-no I either typed it with a normal keyboard or with the windows virtual keyboard function...
-no this wallet only has one transaction on it, I sent all my doge to this new wallet. I have never withdrawn anything from this wallet

GPU mining is a gamble right now... you need to be lucky and mine some shitty coin for a few weeks before it spikes and sell it all for BTC when it spikes hard. It's not easy but there is still some money to be made.. As for the heat problems you might want to look into mining X11 coins. The X11 algo uses less energy and produces less heat. If you want to mine litecoins you can GPU mine DRK (X11)here and it will convert them for LTC (SCRYPT) : 
edit: here is what I do with my GPU ( I have been mining for over 2 years now) Since BTC, LTC and DRK have become so unprofitable to mine, I mine on  . It will convert your earnings to NXT... In my opinion nxt is one of the more interesting altcoins out there, who knows we might se a spike in value soon

you can use bitcoin.de as long as you are a resident of a country of the european union. You have to be able to send euros with SEPA

I sent my coins to this address: 
Prior to that they were here:

yeah I would definitely love to see more people join the Solarcoin community. The primary goal is actually to incentivize to use of Solar energy around the world ( because people who actually own solar panels can claim coins from the foundation by sending in proof of how many megawatt you generated)
yeah the video still needs some fixing, it's one of the first videos about SLR! I will talk to the community so that the video can be improved to avoid other people from getting confused.
Take your time, There is a lot to read about Solarcoin:
If you scroll back a few pages on bitcointalk you should find a whitepaper with lots of information. 
In the meanwhile you can install the solarcoin wallet and send me your address. I can get you started with a few SLR if you want ;)

nice! nxt is really taking blockchain technology to the next level!
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:49:28
I know it's not easy :( thanks so much for trying 
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:49:56
BTC-E deserves some credit after serving the bitcoin community for like 4 years. No issues whatsoever. Yes they are a bit shady but look at the facts, they are here to stay ;)
edit: either they really know their sh*it or every other centralized exchange is run by n00bs.
BTC-e is sitting on the biggest pile of what might be the future of money, they are going nowhere haha

when caps lock is on, it gives me a huge warning message in the doge client... I would not have missed that... Nevertheless I tried replacing all characters by caps . I have not tried what happens if I use the wrong num lock characters, I'm gonna try that now, thx
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:52:07
I have, No luck yet... I was hoping someone on reddit could help, thx
@_date: 2015-02-27 07:40:07
nope unfortunately I didn't. It's not looking good for now :(

Thank you very much!!
Here is what I can remember:
My computer on which the coins were stored is very old. The keyboard is a US INT. layout.
However sometimes I use the windows on-screen keyboard.
Here is a link to a screenshot of what the on-screen keyboard looks like 
At first i though it might be a typo but im starting to think I wrote down the wrong password entirely. 
And here is another password which I used for my old doge wallets which are now empty. It's possible that I accidentally used part of this one since it was written down on the same page: p34!x9B{CQmQt
 I do however think it's probably something similar to the first password but i have no idea....
