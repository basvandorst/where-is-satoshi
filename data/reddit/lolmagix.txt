I agree to a certain extent. But you should tell people to buy Bitcoin because it will make them rich, but only because against fiat currency, it should do well. It's more about the fact that you want your money in anything other than fiat currency because crypto should harshly devalue fiat in the future. If you can trade crypto for stocks in the future, then you should tell your friends to at least put as much as they can in something like an index fund, but just be sure to not have it as raw USD or EUR or anything like that...

First of all, I would say crypto in general will make them richer than holding onto fiat. Not simply Bitcoin will make them rich. Secondly, I would make sure that they understood it is not a "get quick rich" scheme, but rather what I believe to be a solid long-term investment.

Exactly! The whole fucking point is to exchange crypto directly for product by the year 2040. Your goal should not be to convert back to fiat at some point...

I don't know anymore... I was expecting to be able to buy after the drop in the following months after hitting 10k... Now it's going to hit 20k first instead. Point is, it's unreliable to wait on an expected drop. Drops and rises will happen, but it's probably almost impossible to predict

And then they can learn how an altcoin has better tech if they are actually smart, and bitcoin can just be used as a gateway to the blockchain that is ultimately used by most people.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:07:29
For sure!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:29:21
Why would you ever sell? You mean spend directly on product in 2040 I assume? There should never be a reason to go back to fiat unless it is for necessities like you have bills to pay or are starving or some shit...

Diversify! That's why I am saying crypto and not Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:03:49
Completely untrue. You can not have money you want to invest but still be interested in cryptocurrency

He did... He just doesnt realize that coinbase bundled his transaction to save a transaction. He will still get the full 1BTC that he owns
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:03:16
Aaaaaand over 9000
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:19
I mean where is the drop though? Still up 4.5% on the day. If this is "the big one" it is really underwhelming haha

We should all donate to the testicular cancer foundation in honor of the sacrifice this brave man made. This way by sacrificing his left nut, many others' nuts were able to be saved. Truly a Christ among us!
BTW if you are considering watching this, take my word for it and do not. However if you do, make sure you sit there and watch it all to the very end.

It is a bitcoin/ether/litecoin exchange where users go to buy and sell bitcoin for USD or between those 3 currencies. It is the main market for comparing the price of bitcoin to USD afaik (for this subreddit at least)

As long as you reported it on your taxes, you are fine. But just a reminder that if you live in the US and you are trading BTC to USD then of course the government is going to find out as they control USD. The only way to get around the government is to never have the BTC transactions get traced back to USD.

Coinbase uses GDAX as their exchange. Coinbase is more of a wallet than anything. If you try to trade with coinbase, they will charge fees and end up just doing transactions on GDAX anyways. The best thing you could do is use coinbase as a starting wallet before you get a cold wallet, and then transfer your funds to GDAX when you want to trade and then back to coinbase when you want to store again. If you are a begineer here you go:

Other cryptocurrencies that have realized blockchain technology better. Ether for example

It's $9,660 now, sorry about that ~.4% loss

I'm kind of glad I haven't bought because it might get frustrating if I weren't just watching for amusement.

If you want an information hub and no memes, maybe try a platform other than Reddit?

Bitcoin is just a currency, while ehter is an entire cyrtographic network with smart contracts and DAOs. You should look more into it! I'm not necessarily saying Ether is the best and will shut bitcoin down, I am simply stating that it would be ignorant to not consider other cryptography technologies a threat to bitcoin...
