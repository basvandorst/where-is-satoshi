Hasn’t he been accused of money laundering with his failed casino central to it? With Deutsche Bank?
But crypto is the bad currency...

I never said it did, it excludes credit cards and makes a market for bitcoin. People were arguing that they could accept credit cards.

Ironic a book about a digital currency seems to only be available in print.

That's what I figured. The keys have been kept pretty secure and are backed up. I might just generate a different one specifically for this purpose since that wasn't the original intent of them (but haven't been used for anything yet either)

Probably why the term quid arose.

My roommate said the same thing. Apparently that's how an npr report put it. I had to correct him, but he didn't really believe me

OP is correct. I saw it on CNN but (here)[  is an article in Time which says that recreational shops are cash only.

The problem I have with this is what would stop them from somehow withdrawing from my account? Besides photo ID not working and maybe if I don't give a name? Probably be best to set up an account specifically for this (or use the savings account I don't really use)?

It's a good baby step for most until they are comfortable with other ways. I for one fine wire transfers disconcerting for some reason, which is why I went to Coinbase.

Cool, thanks. Now to not be broke so I can start with those or forex. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:21:33
Could make it a crypto party too
@_date: 2013-09-26 15:25:08
Awesome. Thanks for the information. Now I'll just have to figure out a way to get it to work since my account is almost always overdrawn :/
@_date: 2013-08-29 13:50:27
Exactly why I won't use bitstamp. $50 minimum and $15 charge? Screw that. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:32:25
Considering I'm not an ATM and saw them at work, I think it's safe to say that's not the case.

Some cards don't come embossed and are just printed. Usually  debit cards from smaller, local banks in seems

I keep seeing mentions of shares in these companies, what stock exchange in btc is being used? 
@_date: 2013-09-26 20:28:20
Even if they accept it. I'll stick to Spider Oak. They have a zero knowledge /zero access policy that Dropbox doesn't have. 
Seems contrary to the philosophy of a cryptocurrency that has foundations in anonymity to use it to pay for a service that doesn't value either.

I didn't think of encrypting the exported private key and printing that. I've been wanting to do this as well. Already lost one wallet (was empty, luckily). 
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:24:30
That's a public key so it's ok. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:09:57
So, if all others are equal wouldn't it be better to errors on the side of caution and go with the one whose policies at least reflect a principle congruent to sufficient privacy? 
@_date: 2013-09-27 06:38:33
I still encrypt anything of value than gets backed up to spider oak. It's the principle of the small things, and they can all have fun with my San Diego vacation pictures.

Supposedly the keys are generated in the client according to somewhere on their site (I forget where exactly I read that, might've been something else too) 
They released some code:  but it's stuff used by the client not the client itself. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:18:15
Oh, well in that case, maybe I'll give it a shot. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 15:37:09
The way they go about it it sounds like phishing it me. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 14:02:11
I was going to apply a while ago. But sounds like being based in SF is a necessity, relocation is not an option for me at the moment.
