Happy tipping day!

Ha... I think we are 384,000 km from moon, since we are at 400 now...

Merry Christmas!!

Thanks for sharing! 10005 satoshi! @_date: 2014-11-02 23:28:35
I would like to have my first bitcoin! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:41:38
I have done the intro. Cheers!

Just reply to a message with the following:
500 bits EDIT: It should work but apologies I have no balance in my account so you will get an error instead...
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:21:20
Maybe we should contribute a few paper wallets the time capsule as well....
@_date: 2014-12-25 15:02:49
Merry Christmas everyone! A bit late but hope I still make it!
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:31:36
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:03:59
Agree. - At least a "Thanks".
@_date: 2014-11-16 08:42:20
Wow! I didn't received that much but I usually tip back when I see a good post.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:01:40
Besides you, can we know who got the tip?
@_date: 2014-11-07 07:12:28
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:55:23
Removing the post.

Just couple of weeks ago we saw some people decided to abandon bitcoin- because the price was dropping fast.
Today we see some people rushing "all in"- because the price is rising fast.
Very interesting!!
@_date: 2015-01-23 07:21:33
long way to go!
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:05:19
Oh no... we have just dropped back to 300 again!
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:29:28
Both cracked (by the same person?) within 10 hours!!
@_date: 2015-04-02 01:14:39
These are fictional metals... no sure why Bitreserve decided to use these fanciful names.

Just found this thread. It seems the First and Second wallets have both been cracked...
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:04:11
But remember there is a transfer fee... about 100 bits I guess...
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:18:40
Thank you for sharing!
@_date: 2015-03-31 06:43:03
Maybe the price should be in BTC rather than.... $?
@_date: 2015-03-26 06:49:18
Just wait a few days... when the price becomes $300, you will have your $5 back.
@_date: 2015-02-26 05:36:00
Very soon you will be feeling greedy again....
"Maybe 22BTC will make me slightly better than 1 in a million...."
"The price is so low... maybe I just grab a few more...."
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:50:43
I am using a rush wallet BTW.
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:39:00
Your tippings are way more than $10! Changetip should give you $100!
