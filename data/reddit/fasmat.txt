Well GDP is the sum of goods and services sold in a year. Taxes are charged on sold goods and services and (part of these) taxes are used to pay of the debt. So I would say GDP is the right metric to normalize national debt.

Be careful with information from shills that try to sell you gold, they twist the truth to fit their narrative. Let's put that into household numbers, so we can compare it more easily.
If your average household income in 1999 was 60 000 USD. The US state "household" was 39 000 USD in debt if you consider GDP as income. The average household income in 2019 is about 62 000 USD. The US state "household" is now 65 000 USD in debt. The average US household debt as of 2018 was 135 000 USD (loans + credit + student). So the US as a state has less than half the debt of an average US citizen.
The increase in debt is an issue, but its not nearly as dramatic as people want to make you believe. Gold shills tell you that the money system will collapse very soon, and they have been saying that for 20 years or more. The US (and any other government) will do everything to keep it going, with the latest method being Quantitative Easing.
I don't say that I agree with the money policy of governments but this intended miss-information of the public is a much bigger issue!
EDIT, sorry forgot the sources:
debt of US households: [
US household income: [
GDP of US: [

What I'm trying to say is that here data is intentionally presented in a way to push a narrative. The original tweet is from the owners of goldmoney.com, who gain from people mistrusting the money system and buying gold.
There are hundreds of articles and videos online pushing this narrative, and they are almost always being written and published by people and institutions from the gold industry. (because they want to sell you their shiny metals)

Fees on side chains go to the user(s) who transfer you transaction. It kinda works like routing TCP packages through the internet.
For the users transferring your transaction you leave a tip just like transaction fees on the actual chain. Tips for on chain transactions go to the miners, tips on lightning channels go to other lightning users.
At the moment fees are set to 1-2 satoshi per transaction per hop. So even if you have to send your transaction through 1000 users you are still paying half of the current recommended fee (10 satoshi/byte @ 250 bytes per transaction).
EDIT: and if you have multiple channels open you might also route other transactions getting back 1-2 satoshi for every transaction you forward.

 only affects accounts with more that 100k:

Don't know why you are down voted. It only affects very few customers. If you have 100k or more in cash in your bank you are either super wealthy or financially illiterate.
If you have a few millions having this much cash lying around might make sense, but if you have most of your money in cash and you already lose about 2% each year due to inflation anyway.
In Germany banks are very restricted with what they are allowed to do with their customers money and are required by law to insure the money at the ECB. The ECB charges banks about .5% for this insurance and banks are starting to forward these costs.
Any savings account with more than 100k btw. earns 0% interest in all German banks as far as I know for exactly this reason.

So are number of commits which was the original claim.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:34:30
Sorry but this is just not true.
Here are some bitcoin cash clients:
* [Bitcoin ABC](
* [Bitcoin Unlimited](
* [BitcoinXT](
* [parity-bitcoin](
All of them had several commits within the last week?
The total number might be (slightly) lower than bitcoin core, but I assume if we compare the number of lines changed in each repo to bitcoin core we will get a better comparison.
