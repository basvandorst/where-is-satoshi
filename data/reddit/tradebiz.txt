Lots of wealthy people in UK and especially London. They might buy bitcoin just to hold or just to avoid tax.

Becaus thats how the market will play out. I have holded bitcoin since many years back. I’ve also traded bitcoins for other altcoins. Made profit and made losses. What I learned is that you will always make more money by holding.
Trading seems nice, but thats not the reality.
Many people have invested lots of money in bitcoin. Do you think that it will dissapear or go to a bottom where it will be worth less than previous ath?

If you just ride out the wave, you will be fine. No need to stress. Looking at day to day charts or weekly charts are just a pain. It will screw up the mentality.
I am very confident about a next bullrun in coming years. Until then, I would just stack and watch them grow.
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:20:00
Seems like you can have two ledgers. I would split up the holdings in two different wallets instead. Better play safe.
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:05:10
Companies can buy bitcoin and save it instead of paying tax on profit.
@_date: 2019-12-14 10:48:08
It’s not just the miners. It is about the exchanges aswell.
Miners can mine bitcoin but if the exchanges doesnt accept deposits because whatever reason, then the whole idea fails. Democratising bitcoin mining is a small part of a bigger problem.
@_date: 2019-12-01 12:23:57
They are not elites. They are scumbags. Bitcoin is a great alternative to fiat money, and bitcoin i actually real. Fiat money is kind of worthless.
@_date: 2019-12-05 07:51:48
If you can buy and hold, you are almost gurantueed to make a profit. If you daytrade, then there is better chance to lose your money than making profit.
Just try to ride out the waves. A small or big group of miners and traders control a big part of the price of bitcoin, in order for them to get more rich, but for anyone else, there is still money to be made.
@_date: 2019-12-20 10:03:53
Kind of true. We want big profits, but at the same time, we don’t even want to sell our bitcoins. We just think that it will increase more and more in the future.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:36:29
Just remember all the people who are reading, but havent joined this channel. I think the number would be at 1.5 million with those lurkers.
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:52:35
It can increase even before that.  No one really knows. If everyone knew, they would just buy as much bitcoin now as possible, and then sell after the halvening.
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:34:26
This is cool, but do you go around with this in public?
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:17:26
Some people say not your keys, not your coins. Fine, I agree. But some of us are traders, miners, whatever. We need exchanges and we trust then. Therfore, we need to have som coins there to work with.
We shouldnt be worried about not your keys not your coins. This is just wrong. Do you say that to your money in the bank aswell? I bet you dont.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:09:25
Then whats the point of your post?
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:29:06
Bitcoin is a important for freedom, the economic and much more. Stack as many you can, and only trade to aim to make profit. I don't really like to spend bitcoins or other altcoins on items.
Just imagine, carrying around as much money as you want, from one country to another, with bitcoin, without anyone noticing or anyone asking you at the airport. It's a great technology and it creates a space for others to become rich, independent and it also create a lot of jobs. Good for the economy.
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:17:57
Seems like a good function but what do you mean by that it can show all my holdings for supported coins even though the coin app is not om the nano s. How does it get that information? I haven’t touched it really. I will have to have a look into it. However, I just want and need my Ledger Nano S to work fine when plugging it, and that will do it. 
It’s very useful to watch holdings real time via a app connected to the ledger nano s however. Will this app also support sending and receiving coins? Then it will be more like a mobile wallet right?
@_date: 2019-12-14 10:49:45
Don’t overthink it. Just buy bitcoin, hold it and only buy cryptos with high daily volume just in case you need to cash out for whatever reason.
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:14:56
Seems like there is a lot of updates on the ledger wallet. I will have to look into my nano s soon actually, because I dont bother to touch it as it only have one coin.
I’ve always thought of more wallets as more safe but it’s quite a bit of work handling all the seeds, phrases and updates for each hardware.
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:08:20
Then I would say go after them and try to get your money back.
I know that many exchanges are acting weird. This makes me wounder how large whales are trading on there? I mean anyone with leys say 10-100 btc. Now your amount is not little but its not alot either. I dont know why the exchanges keep small investor and traders funds. Its really annoying and it hurts the overall image of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-12-20 17:59:05
I don’t know how I would use this yet, but it seems like you put in a lot of work. Good job. People like you deserve to get some satoshi donated to your wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:49:34
I promised my self to not check the bitcoin chart today. It’s going good. However, I still check the chart of my other cryptos.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:34:34
Mine is older than 20 months. Yes, some people just write when it goes bad and for some it goes quite well but they dont say it. Thats why I never bothered to touch it. As long as I can see my coins on their wallet address in the explorer then I am fine I guess.
I just looked up ledger live but will have to read a bit more about it.
@_date: 2019-12-12 15:22:04
I hope you have a wallet and access to your private keys, and that this is not just a coin where the seller pretends that it is a bitcoin. Because real bitcoins are more like numbers on a screen, not a physical coin. 
Just saying this for your own sake, so you know.
Welcome to the world of bitcoiners and we all wait until this thing skyrocket.
@_date: 2019-12-16 16:13:02
No human being can predict the market. Because the market is not controlled by a single person but rather a few.
Just ask yourself, is it reasonable for btc to hit $100k before end of the year? Just ask yourself.
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:48:58
Now ask everyone to pay you in bitcoins. Well done, keep pushing for more awerness for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:39:12
I use binance but I am yet to find a very reliable and sage exchange with good withdrawls.
@_date: 2019-12-05 07:49:43
Rich people in developed countries will always have money, unfortunately, and thats why they dont care about bitocin now. Some of us, buy bitcoin now, to trade, make profit and gains, later on.
Therfore, bitcoin have many purposes other than freedom and fiat gateway.
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:05:13
Just open a account on a reliable exchange. Kraken is good. Send your bitcoins to kraken then withdrawl your money in a sepa transfer.
@_date: 2019-12-07 10:08:02
No one can really predict the market. If we knew that bitcoin will drop bemow $7500, we would take a lot of loans and buy as much as we can just to sell for a profit later on. But it isnt realistic.
Just buy two bitcoins now, then two later. The remaining bitcon, buy it and trade carefully, if you want.
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:49:37
What if you look at more than a 1 year ago timeframe?
Everything can be said about different time frames. Whatever serves the purpose.
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:46:25
I bought my first bitcoin at bitstamp for $146. I still remember the day.
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:49:22
I wish more exchanges would be as kraken. Fast deposits for fiat and cryptos, and fast withdrawls for sepa transfers. Even crypto withdrawls are fast.
Just hope that they stay the same way. Not many good and reliable exchanges are left. It is also hard for people to know what exchange to use since many people dont tell others what good experience they have with the exchanges.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:18:11
Bitcoin is here to stay, and there are online a limited number of them. Not everyone will have a bitcoin.
Just imagine that you can store millions of dollars or just a dollar or two, on a blockchain, carrying it all over the world without anyone knowing. Its really simple. You just have a hardware wallet or a wallet in your phone. Just cross the borders ans no one knows what you have. Its your cash. You shouldnt have to tell anyone about it, as long as its legit and hard earned money in legal ways.
I am bullish on bitcoin and I am holding bitcoin because I know that many people will need it sooner or later, for different purposes. Such as storage, gateway from fiat, speculation and much more.
Bitcoin is opening up so many closed gates in economics and finances. Just imagine when the middle class in rich or developing countries will rush to buy bitcoin because of hundreds if not thousand reasons.
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:57:53
I haven’t updated mine ever since I bought it. Haven’t plugged it in yet because I am holding. Will I alsp have issues upon updating the firmware?
In example, will my nano s show the latest update?
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:28:37
Bitcoin is a asset known by many, and it have a value other than being a currency. It’s a whole new level of mechanism in terms of finances and trading.
Bitcoin serve a great purpose and is transferable to anywhere in the world without you carrying around a lot of cash in person or other commodities. Just simply, your wallet information will do good.
For this reason, many people would want to buy bitcoin. Just imagine all the rich people in the world that have lots of money, but they are not sure if they can store it safely. They will buy bitcoin and then put the money in a wallet and no one even know that they have a digital asset.
@_date: 2019-12-25 12:50:56
Thanks. I am glad I bought a few btc last dip, but I haven’t sold them yet.
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:56:24
I kinda understand how it works, by you explaining in detail. Thanks for that.
Just holding mostly. Never sending or withdrawing huge amount of coins but I want to set up a second option for this and I dont know if the ledger live will support it.
So the ledger live is installed on the ledger nano d and it also have a iPhone app right? From what I can see. Does it allow you to send or withdrawl coins anytime? Then its more like a mobile wallet.
I have a few hours worth of reading to catch up with all the things the ledger wallet company have done lately.
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:54:49
How much did you have in HITBTC?
I never touch shady exchanges even though they list lots of shitcoins with volume which can lead to quick profits.
@_date: 2019-12-18 09:30:01
So basically we will moon in a short period of time. Good to know.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:13:13
Congratulations. Bitcoin is nice, you will only wish that you would have more of it, but never stress.
Dont tell a lot of people about that you own bitcoin, things can get strange in a short period of time. Store your keys safely and dont look at charts daily, it will just be time consuming.
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:54:18
Yes, that is pretty much it. It’s the same process elsewhere aswell where you can cash out to your bank directly.
Kraken however, from my experience, are very reliable as a exchange and trading platform.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:54:46
These hacks are inside job. I dont really think that real hackers are just going to try to hack a wallet or exchange or whatever it is that they target.
The owner of these exchanges will just dissapear with all the money, get a new identity or transfer everything to someone close to them. Then just buying propeties, invest in other companies and get life going.
@_date: 2019-12-26 08:40:02
Time frame is everything and this post is not even accurate.
