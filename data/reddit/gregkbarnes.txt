I think.... Segwit is the first step to LN. Maybe atomic swaps will cut hard into their revenues... 
I think the above statement is true... anyone care to validate?

Once you have your private key, you will gain access to your BTC and related forks.
Just never give ANYONE those 12 words or your private key.

Let’s say I buy 10 bitcoin at 1000$/BTC. I decide to sell 5 of them at 2000$/BTC (the same amount of my initial investment). Is this a taxable event, or only after I sell the remainder?

I want to understand the deeper part of why it's difficult to get cash onto the site. There must be some laws that prevent it from the states. Loved that part about Mt. Gox being the safe option though ;)

They also claim to hold a large percentage of their wallets' BTC in cold storage as well. Definitely like that idea.

Exactly. How does one go about depositing dollars on this site from the US? The deposit options offered do NOT accept US customers... why? What regulation is preventing them?

OP - thanks for a view into the mind of the institutional investor on Bitcoin.
Regarding the scaling issue (and many others):
Check out the idea of building layers atop of the bitcoin network (RSK is one of these groundbreaking projects). Basically you can create a two-way peg to bitcoins, but transact on one or many separate networks that could be made to scale or fulfill other specific needs. The big point is that the base layer of trust is still there and still bitcoin.
Food for thought :) thanks again.

My recent transfer of 4 BTC (worth ~$4700 at this time) costed about $0.24. The price to convert back in my current Bitcoin exchange (Kraken) was 0.16%.
That's pretty tough to beat at the moment...

There's some uncertainty in the market right now in regards to how things will end in China. But, unless you're a seasoned trader, the best move is probably to hold for long-term value (assuming you believe in bitcoin, of course). If you're in to make a quick buck, you might... but there is going to continue to be a lot of volatility for a long time.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:41:53
You could always try reading. It turns out there's a good deal of information on the internet.

The private key is all that is needed to access your bitcoins going forward (independent of platform).
Basically, it is needed to sign/verify transactions associated with that address (public key). After an outgoing transaction is verified (this can ONLY be done by your private key), you can broadcast this transaction to the blockchain. Once there, it is replicated among nodes until it will be put into a block by a node who solved the next block. They put it in the block, prioritizing by fee (Bc that's their incentive).

After such a quick rise, there is often a period of volatility until the market gains confidence at new levels. Picking the top is impossible, but you went for it and nailed it. GJ.

Bitcoin has a few advantages:
1) The size and decentralization of the network.
2) The utter simplicity of the protocol: this is underrated IMO. It is intentionally very simple and limited in scope. By serving as the basic layer of trust, one that has a very small and limited attack surface, it is very valuable. Other chains can be built atop/on the side of it for various function, smart contracts, etc.
3) The size and decentralization of the network. Seriously, this. The network has incredible resilience and 100% uptime. In addition, the decentralized nature help to protect the system from manipulation or other problems stemming from central control.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:04:08
That’s correct: only 21MM will ever be minted - it should take another 100+ yrs if I remember correctly. They are minted exponentially slower over time (reward for mining is cut in half every so often). It is also important to note that the “difficulty” of mining is always dynamically adjusting to the total mining power of the network so that blocks take ~10 minutes. So, the rate of mining blocks is always about the same.
Once all coins are minted, The miners will only focus on validating transactions and get payed in bitcoin through transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:52:36
It means the supply is smaller, not much else

Got a bit frustrated... people are always associating cryptos to illegal activities. Sorry for the non-helpful response.

There’s also the whole “proof of work” and fixed supply portion. Similar to real gold, there was energy and money used to mine it.

If the address was created, it will never be deleted. They are supposed to monitor the address for your incoming transaction. If you look at a blackchain explorer, do you see any transactions using that address?

Accepting another method of payment will only help your business. In the case of Bitcoiners, it may even attract some to it.
Regarding fees: credit cards charge 2.5-3% per transactions and you have to worry about chargebacks.
Your public wallet address (public key) can be safely shared. Your private key should never be shared.
