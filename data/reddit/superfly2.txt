He single-handedly saved the panel he was on. The other speakers were far from great and his explanation of how the blockchain could be used for contracts and other claims of ownership (colored coins) really blew their minds.

Just think how the next few weeks will play out if gox fails? I'm not speculating that they will but the effect that might have plays a part in the market. If people are using the gox price as a barometer of it's health it would effect the other exchanges.

Wait so if I do believe that Bitcoin will be around in 10 years, using his logic, then of course I should invest? Warren Buffet aka the oracle of Omaha is one of the most respected investors of all time. His mantra is "invest in what you know" he doesn't understand Bitcoin and therefore would never invest in it. This is not a condemnation, Bitcoin is not trains or insurance, it is something new. He once said that he would never invest in Google or Apple because he does not know how to value such companies. New technology is much harder to understand, predict, and model than a traditional business that has been around for hundreds of years.

Thank you so much for taking the time, this pretty much answers my question exactly. If someone were trying to figure out a valuation formula this may be a basis or a starting point for setting a lower limit. I do believe this number should be decreasing over time given cheaper power and Moore's law. Here were my other considerations to start the basis of a formula:
     
    ((Blockchain Cost 
    + % of money spent globally on anti-counterfeiting technology 
    + % of remittance market 
    + % of payment processor market
    + % savings on fraudulent chargeback transactions
    - Network transaction fees) 
    * USD Inflation Rate) 
    / current supply - lost/destroyed coins
**Warning: the above may not make sense**
I don't think anyone besides you is really going to look at this post but I figured, why not?
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:15:32
Something like calculating the 
        (cost per avg block * electricity * total blocks)

ATM owners and operators in New York should be exempt from holding an MSB licence to operate.

A true bank run on gox would be really bad for all the other exchanges. This move by gox even if out of self interest is protecting the other exchanges by letting gox bleed dry slowly instead of sending shockwaves.

The DDoS flooded the exchange (MtGox) with so many order that it basically broke the trading engine. People were putting buy and sell orders only to have them execute an hour later (the dreaded lag) this was the real reason for the panic, people were trading blind. MtGox fixed this after they rolled out a new trading engine but the damage was done to their reputation as the very first great Bitcoin crash in June 2011 was also their fault an SQL injection against their database in case you were wondering.

It depends how they go about selling them, over a reasonable period of time it would be fine but if they decided to clear the order books it would be disastrous. The depth at Bitstamp is only ~25,000 btc and Mt.Gox is ~150,000 not sure if they would use foreign exchanges.
