Just in case you thought the Facebook randoms offering you great investment opportunities in broken english were legit...

You revealed your crypto net worth to your sister? Damn man, how much was it?

The same articles that say it's mostly younger people also say it's almost exclusively used in the US so that makes sense.

Maybe not but if you Google it that's what most of the top results say. I actually think either one can sound better depending on the sentence.

You made me Google it and it turns out that older people tend to say by accident while people under 40 tend to say on accident. How old are you?

Well you can if you want. Nobody is stopping you and a lot of people already do it.

Actually yes. Enjoy this magical year of linguistic freedom my friend. Enjoy.

About an hour and a half ago would have been better.

If it's worth $300 today and it goes to $3000 tomorrow then that $100 wallet today cost him $1000 tomorrow.

If he has a few hundred dollars worth of crypto a $100 wallet is probably not the best investment.

Fiat that he could otherwise put into crypto so might as well be crypto. But the point is there are plenty of inexpensive ways to take secure ownership of your own crypto without spending roughly a third of your portfolio's value on a wallet.

Probably just because trading pairs are primarily in BTC so when a site like CMC calculates a price they have to use coinx/BTC X BTC/USD to get coinx/USD.

But it's one of if not the safest exchange plus they keep the vast majority offline so even if they got hacked they would easily be able restore what was stolen out of their own pockets without customers losing anything. 
Edit. I should add that the biggest risk is that the customer themself gets hacked.
