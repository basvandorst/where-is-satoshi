Happy prime day!

Same I haven't started trading BTC pairs yet just fiat but got hit pretty bad the last two days. If you have a plan just stick to it and try to back test if you can helped me a lot.

As someone who has made money using TA I don't really follow your reasoning.
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:11:59
Why all the TA hate?
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:02:20
Would there be merit in mining/staking altcoins just to be able to use them as a non Fiat means to aquire BTC to bipas the banks? Seeing as they currently control the flow of my money I want to find a way around.
@_date: 2019-07-19 09:34:44
Can't really say I agree with the long term TA, but from my own personal experience there is a great deal of merit in short term analysis. Also when trading you don't need to be right more then you are wrong. I trade strategies that are only correct about 40% of the time yet they provide a majority of my profit. A lot of it isn't being right as much as it is managing your risk. This a way a few bad trades can be overcame by one good one. 
Again I really don't agree, nor pay attention to the articles and fan fair regarding "oh by October will will be here", hence why I asked about the TA hate to begin with. However, I do believe there is a place for TA when a considerable amount of research is done into market patterns. I blog about this sort of thing  [here]( I also have some of my bots forward their actions to my Twitter account  
Maybe I can help change your mind maybe you can laugh as I lose money. Doesn't matter to me just want to share my thoughts on the matter.

Saw this this morning as well. Apparently they are getting out of global investment banking entirely.
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:18:00
I whole heatedly agree. Nothing lasts forever and you need to come up with your own plan of action as using what everyone else is using will just decay the system. I also think a great deal of the TA people are exposed to is more click bate then actual research. 
All in all I think this was one of the best online conversations I've had in awhile. Thank you.

As someone stated before it's way simplier to buy the etf then to go through the registration and storage of your own btc. Plus it brings it to the mainstream market as opposed to binance and friends. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:04:46
They also come at a fraction of the cost. You can get a gold etf for like $150 where the price per gram is $1200. 
Please note this is an example. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:11:51
Not sure if this is the place for this but I have been working on some programming tools for trading and been blogging about it [here](
So far my tools are geared for coinbase but I will be adapting them to binance soon. 
If anyone knows a better place to discuss this sort of stuff please let me know. 
Thank you. 
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:46:43
As a TA trader I beg to differ. I don't think long term stuff is necessarily as accurate as everyone wants them to be but there is some merit in the short term.
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:21:19
Can you link me an article or something would love to take a look.
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:09:00
And with good risk management that's all ya need
@_date: 2019-11-18 13:25:53
I hope your right, but then again the markets don't care about hope.
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:48:43
Your suppose to do the TA first then make the decision, and remove all emotion from that decision. Not the easiest thing to do and something I still struggle with my self. But yeah if you are long and you start drawing all sorts of limes on the chart to reassure your self it's time to GTFO.
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:57:27
I think you are correct. The market is being I fluenced so it's definitely a matter of time before they blow away the short side. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:50:19
Every little bit of profit counts I guess. They might have been running in on a really tight margin and plan on following the price as far down as possible. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:14:13
Good to know thank you. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:11:15
Will they just lower the hash rate? I saw someone argue that people will keep mining as they are technically long on Bitcoin so they just keep the coins but some of these  opperations have serious overhead. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:57:04
I run a similar bot they are probably just riding the volitality making the markets buying little bits as it falls and selling on the way up. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:16:10
Scam stuff aside, isn't that how an exchange works? I can do the same on gdax with USD. Untill people actually start using and making it available to the general public it's kinda just there to trade imo. Where I live there is nothing I can do to make crypto other then trade and manage nodes, and there isn't much in the way of spending crypto except for on other cryptos so I just kinda keep on accumulateing as best I can (been losing more lately) It would be nice if I could use it to buy gas or groceries and until that happnes people have to exit one way or another or just wait forever which for most people is super hard. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:29:20
This wasn't really a long term speculation more or less an observation of the current market conditions and the cycles that keep occuring, mainly the Bart's. We kinda floated on down at the end of last week so I was expecting a nice little pump in the near future as I was fairly certain that the whales we're collecting more coins. I assumed this because I just completed making an automated trader and in that process I became very familiar with the current patters of the market, not to the sense of being correct 100% of the time obvisouly. Just noticed what the calm looks like before the storm.
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:56:07
So it looks like a stagnet BTC will naturally draw down?
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:44:43
I mean moons are bullish so makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:37:04
Where those buys or sells or was it buy sell buy sell? They are trying to make tiny bots of profit of each trade and just keep trading as the price goes up and down. You figure they make 10¢ per trade buying 1 btc at a time after 1000 trades they make $100 assuming they don't have any orders hanging. 
Also I plan on open sourcing my bot in short bit if ppl are interested. Still got a few things to smooth out and to write a manual...
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:23:56
If they are waiting I have no idea what it will take for them to sell off. I guess it all depends on their entry point into the market. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:56:06
This hit me right in the feels... I mean wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:05:45
Not true I bet the bots the whales use read Reddit and get a general feel for how us commoners will react. 
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:34:25
That is an oddly specific number any math/reasoning for it?
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:36:41
I honestly don't see how it could bottom out much further. If everyone who has the opinion of it going lower has sold off then who else is there to sell down the price? Some whales could come buy I guess but if they are still holding then wouldn't they want the price to go up? We hit the end of a quarter and the end of a futures contract expiration. Now I feel there is only room to go up. Plus if people are manuplicting the market they would use the low volume of buyers to quickly drive up the price no? 
This is all specualtion. But that is how I am feeling and why.

What is the issue with USDT?

Bot trader here. See [my blog]( haven't posted in awhile do to the fact that I'm moving all my stuff over to kraken. 1% fees round trip for a little guy like me sucks.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2019-10-20 22:03:17
I kinda want to see how quickly the price can double. I might go back and check, I really don't think 11 days is that in unreasonable given the historic data.
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:53:45
It's all about that +-9% my man.
@_date: 2019-02-20 17:58:32
Not sure if that 100% a certainty but ETH did rally before BTC ran up this past weekend. No idea why or how the money moved that way but hey I'll take what I can get. 
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:33:58
There were more buyers then sellers for a brief moment then someone or several someones decided to sell more then people were buying. And now we are here.
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:33:56
In your jellies?
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:59:23
Not advice but what I do. I log each trade entry and exit time and average price baught at and sold at then enter it all manually into turbo tax or other such system when the time comes. I usually pay a percentage equal to that of my normal income tax percentage on anything held for less then a year. But gains are gains. I both hodl and swing trade, I don't do anything intraday because the more entries you have in your tax form the more complicated it becomes. I like it because I think it's a good way to hedge against massive draw downs we can hit. Make sure to always trade with a plan that you have tested and make sure to stick to that plan. 
Check out [my blog](
And again nothing is financial advice just my experience  and how I manage things.
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:06:33
Got this this morning lol reacked of a bot from a mile away lol
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:05:00
Why make an account today just to throw your 2 cents in here? A lot of us were willing to risk what we put in and are fine with riding it out for kicks.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:31:57
Question... If everyone activly traded and increased the volume of the market would this give the whales less abaloty to buy down the price since there would be way more volume  at the various price levels?
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:57:51
Hey seeing a lot of hate twords Coinbase.  Why is this and should I look at trading on another platform?
Edit: I trade on Coinbase pro or what use to be GDAX, sorry for any confusion, I do not trade using standard Coinbase.

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, we held onto the bull for more then 8 seconds did we win?

If bch drops below eth I think we could see some silly things happen. It would be the first time the fiat value of the larger coins switched order is quiet some time. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:30:00
Seeing this post with the time stamp of 5 hours ago lol can't wait 
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:46:25
I both actively trade and HODL with about an 20-80 split. My thought is I can make some fiat as things move just in case it all goes down at some point. Spent the last year writing bots so now that's it's running I feel a lot better. It's sort of a means of diversification for me.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:34:19
Price wise not market cap.

Look up "stagflation". Also inflation vs deflationary economies. I highly recommend a macro economic course for anyone interested in crypto. Had to take one for a gen-ed in college and it really helped. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:11:44
I mean eth is worth more then bcash now right? That's got to mean something as it's moving asynchronously with everything else. Could we see it float down and die? That would be great.
