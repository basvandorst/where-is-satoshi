I think this Forbes guy had missed the opportunity when bitcoin was cheap and now he can't cope with his imagined losses , he can't watch other guys making profits .

Congrats man , give away your coins for free to your friends , neighbours and start a community and distribute there too and when lot of people will have it start something where they can use it , like casinos as you said or something where they can buy something for your kudos .If enough people will start using kudos it will have a value and you will become rich.

How would you know they are not buying ?They may have already bought millions worth of crypto. Do you really believe what they say ?

Biggest threat to Cryptos are our governments ,they want control over their people ,Cryptos give us freedom. We probably should create our own nation  CRYPTONATION :) where the people will embrace the technology .

Is there any magic ball to see when to sell and when to buy ?

What if I tell you I own 1000 BTC which I bought at total some of $100 , so my net worth is around 4 million . Friends and relatives get jealous they cant believe I turned $100  into 4 million dollars by doing nothing .They also want to buy  They are not sure they should buy now or not and they never were because BTC is all time they are hoping BTC will go down and buy lot of it but it's going the way they dont want which is frustrating them and they start talking bad about it . 
This is human nature .
Jamie Dimon is a CEO which means he has to show results to investors .But peoples money going into bitcoin instead of their bank which they would have used to invest/lending or whatever can make more money.Today bitcoin not big enough to challenge them but the rate at which it's increasing is a real threat to his bank .
He may be really concerned but you have only two choices invest or not . Who knows how much this bubble could grow anything under  $ 1trillion could not be in bubble this is what I believe.
P.S:  I don't have 1000 BTC I was just trying to make point .
