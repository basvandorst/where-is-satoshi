I explained it as the government/banks/people agreeing how much money was worth. We compared it to video games, why is this one worth $60, the used ones $5 or $10?

I'd like to 2nd heifer.org - but I'm also a fan of IPA:  their goal is to use experiment based economics to help the baseline causes of poverty and the best remediation methods. 
Is there a canonical list anywhere of charities that accept bitcoin?

I explained as best as I could, but she is a first grader after all, and we both have ADHD, we rounded out the night watching the Death to Pennies short by CGPGrey.
