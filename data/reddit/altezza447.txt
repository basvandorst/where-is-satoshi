you can verify your debit/credit card soon as u add it. they do same process like paypal with 2 deposits to account, unlike paypal that send it in  2-3 days, i know coinbase send it instantly so u can confirm that same day.

Seeing how u been in crypto so long you should know better. If going move money make own wallets send over. I never import key to no site or program going make own new wallet do a test send. Better safe than sorry. You know you can't do anything about it. Stuff like this happen ever day
