Because if there's anyone who can spot a scam it's probably him. His assessment to the susceptibility of price manipulation is probably spot on.

Most businesses just don't want to be in the speculation game. Pay for something with $1000 of bit coin. In a week it could be worth $3000 or it could be worth $10.

Something I'm starting to worry about is that the crypto technologies wont undermine central banks, central banks will use it to undermine governments. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:58:26
Central banks was probably a bad choice. The financial sector is probably more a long the lines of what I was thinking.

Of course they could.
Pump and dumps, classics cornering, price manipulating. The big institutions keep getting busted trying these things when it's illegal. The idea that those types aren't putting enormous effort into scamming crypto somehow is absurd. 
That all the hold / get rich / got rich threads make it to the hot page and all the skeptical threads end up in controversial should tell you something's up.

As well as during the pumps. The lesson is if you're not the one paying for the propaganda you're at the mercy of those that are.

In this context fractional reserve bitcoining would be a straight up Ponzi.

Shouldn't they just be matching buyers to sellers? If they're also making their own bets anyone who lets them hold any cash or crypto is crazy. Wouldn't that be like letting nasdaq hold your stocks unsecured and unregulated?

Probably a little more than that. The front page of this sub looks like a bad '90's get rich quick video.

Well, it would probably take at least a year to lobby, convince, and define the rules of a bitcoin coin futures contract that would allow you to short the coin in scale.  
When did this dramatic increase in price begin again? 
We don't know and probably wont know how it's done until after the fact. The only thing you can be sure of is there are a lot of clever people with money working on how to scam the system.

Given that it's not really a currency or regulated like a bank, if exchange were to operate this way it's really more of a securities ponzi scheme.

While this seems like it might be a valid concern I think the bigger issue is Wall Street money is now playing in the space.  
In the last 20 years the street has collectively been busted manipulating the price of everything they could figure out how to manipulate. Libor, caused rolling black outs in California, and at one point had entire networks of warehouses shipping aluminum back and forth to each other to hide the fact they were hoarding to drive up prices.  
And that was for things they knew were illegal.  
The idea that they aren't trying to manipulate public perception is absurd.

A currency or payment system needs to be doing 1000's of transaction a second at less than a penny per transaction.   
If it can't handle that type of volume it's not a viable payment system or currency.

I don't understand why this is hard to see. It would probably take a year or more to convince the right people and create futures trading. And it was a year ago bitcoin started going way off the mean. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 10:59:33
In hindsight this whole 2 year period seems like one big scam pulled off by a hedge fund.
Start greasing the wheel to get a futures market created in a year, start driving the price up, paying for PR and buzz, run a bunch of pump and dumps to start off loading some, use a bunch to back futures, watch to price fall and laugh all the way to private island.

All the stupid money has been shaken out of the tree already. 
The party might be over.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:15:52
Probably bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:17:59
Once the dust settles and the veil of denial is lifted, bitcoin might not even return to the mean, which is probably around $700. 
If the institutional people see regulation coming their money is out. Banks are making it harder to trade. The frenzy showed it's not really suitable to be an efficient method of payment or a currency. So it will be left only with it's intrinsic value and the stink of having been a tulip craze.

r/bitcoin as whole doesn't even begin to meet the semblance of an ethical fiduciary standard. The HODL mentality alone is ridiculous. "you must never sell that security no matter what." Bad news is "FUD"  
More religious belief than any sane financial introspective.

Think they're measuring relative percentage change from the starting value. Not market cap relative to the world economy.

If you buy 10 shares at $100 dollars ( $1000 ) and borrow $900 to buy it, you can think of the shares as being held as collateral for the $900 loan.  
If the share price drops to $90 you can either put in more money or the holder of the loan well sell all 10 shares to get their money back.  
Crypto markets are small enough and opaque enough that if you had inside information on where a big positions margin call is ( the price point they would have to liquidate ) you could potentially drive the market below that point and then buy the shares.
