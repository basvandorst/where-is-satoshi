Just did some research on you! I'm sure the boss would be quite excited to know (assuming here) the CTO of the largest Bitcoin product search engine is interested! Is the whole team in Toronto? Could you ever see a corporate catering gig as a possibility? That's something to get him seriously considering it.

Thanks for the feedback! I think paying his employees in Bitcoin would be further away then just accepting them as they're a bit older and probably would see it risky in terms of payroll and taxes. I just want him to start accepting it as it's helping a great cause and brings in a new community that likes to support.
What would be the easiest way for him to do it? Provided he can't be there all the time to use his wallet on his phone. Pretty sure there isn't a store tablet either.

Great, I'll take a look at it! You added a bunch more! Is there an agreed upon POS or exchange wallet that the community happily supports? I thought coinbase was the main one and then I just read someone having glitches way too often. I need to go to my boss with something absolutely risk free and works as smoothly as possible.

Awesome I'll be sure to pass this along. Are you in Toronto? The food here ranges from good quality to high end, do it's easy for bills to hit $100 on not even a large purchase. He also wants to get more into catering and so it could make a large purchase really easy just done in Bitcoin. Any advice for how to accept it easily? Good luck with your barber!
