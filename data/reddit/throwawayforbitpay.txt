The $30M was raised in Spring of 2014.

I know, but the " " indicated this guy felt it was embezzlement.

No skin off my nose. Believe it or don't. It will be impossible to hide this many people updating their LinkedIn profiles over the coming days.

Total let go. I think that was mostly Atlanta and San Fran, maybe a couple remote folks. Not sure about Amsterdam. Total left is probably 35-40.

I used to believe that the true believers on this subreddit were right to be upset with the buttcoiners who trolled here made hay. However, the down votes I see foisted on anyone who speaks truth, many that have been proven right in their predictions and yet continue to get down voted, affirms that the sycophants are beginning to out number the rational technologists and futurists here.

This one will make headlines. What kind of proof you want? Pictures with people walking out with boxes?

Depends if they are able to not just stop the bleeding, but quickly grow some new limbs and address the head injury.

Heard the same thing from another source.

That's exactly what happened. New building, tripled the staff in 6 months from (30ish to 90ish), and all the revenue was coming from the nouveau riche and people buying new mining equipment and precious metals. False indicator that led to executive hubris.

When the CEO is the lead developer of a company the size of BitPay, it's difficult to do the things that a CEO should be doing... like building a collaborative culture. When the "leaders" demonstrate no loyalty, openly disagree in front of staff that have never worked in a "real company", and make people feel they can't bring ideas forward for fear their CEO will call them stupid, you will begin to lose true and honest feedback.

Agreed. History is replete with business leaders who bucked conventional wisdom and stuck to their vision despite what detractors say, but the biographies of their success are written post hoc. History is also littered with leaders who's insistence on staying to course in the face of clear evidence the strategy isn't working, discount critical opinion as people less intelligent as they are. These often wind up on the proverbial ash heap. Hard to say where this one will end, but the source of the decisions that have led this far are still in their jobs.

There are some GREAT people at BitPay and some major navel gazing sycophants who have fallen into the trap of believing that past success was an indicator that they can do no wrong. So much talent, so little of it truly harnessed by leaders who know how to lift people up versus make themselves feel good with their press.

No, at the peak staffing it was probably just under $1M a month. I bet they are down to just under $500K in salary &amp; benefits. Another $100K for everything else recurring... probably gives them $10-$12M cash on hand.
