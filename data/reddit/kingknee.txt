AFAIK, they moved to Hong Kong to avoid all the China FUD. Antshares / Neo was also never set up as a ponzi from the get-go, they never promised anything. Anyways, I don't even own any Neo (anymore) but I still don't see any comparison to Bitconnect.

I think it's the psychological "value" of owning whole coins and lots of them instead of something like 1/10th of a Bitcoin. While it makes no difference in gains and losses percentage-wise, I can see why people do it.

If they've made a deal to do this, they would have a system in place to measure the "demand" for "artificial demand".

You would have to have some kind of small participation fee or you could end up sending millions to dead wallets. Even if the wallet has fairly recent transactions, it is no guarantee that the original owner still has access to it. He / she could have used the address a few times and moved on.

Most onramps from fiat don't offer tons of currencies to choose from. Coinbase and Bitstamp have 4 or less for instance.

If you really are as alone in the world as you say, I would personally transfer it all to a single paper wallet, a little at a time just to be safe.

Your Bitcoin is always "stored" on the blockchain. Everything else is just different ways of keeping your private key safe. If you transfer everything to your Nano S and then paste your private key to me, you won't have any added security. It's still all about your private key.

It's a terrible security risk to have others make paper wallets for you. There is no way in the world that you can be sure they won't store the private keys for monitoring / later sweeping.

They are trading fees between each other to make sure they only have to process the highest fees and then they profit share. What's a 5 Satoshi fee to fill up the pool if you can get an 800 Satoshi fee trough? This mempool is not natural. It's not people rushing to transfer btc. Most new people leave them on the exchanges.

Please PM a link to that article when you finish it. I find that the whole "greed works" aspect of BTC is breaking down when greed can literally make it stop working as a currency. 
I've previously read that Satoshi didn't anticipate pools and that's fair enough, but pools control everything now. I firmly believe that if the pool miners stopped their shenanigans today, we'd be back on track within 10 hours. 
Contrary to the whitepaper, BTC's functionality as a currency is currently being sabotaged by greed. It is counterproductive for miners to NOT do this. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:18
Still, respect a mom who cares. Not everyone had that.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:36:35
I'm just saying that Satoshi's whitepaper basically claims that the system works because of the greed of everyone involved. I don't find it hard to believe that mining pools come together to increase their earnings even if it screws with the system, but if they can do that then the system doesn't work properly.
I'd love to hear anyone tell me how Satoshi accounted for this situation.

Well, there's a cup of coffee, people used to buy that with Bitcoin. Also what seems to be a Corinthian column with pair of buttocks on top. This might reference something said by a Ugandan academic in 2017 when she was publicly criticising her president and his wife.
Uganda, as we know, is found in the African continent and thus not too far away from Venezuela in South America. Venezuela has been massively adopting Bitcoin lately.  Coincidence? 
Still, It's all speculation at this point.

Nothing is forever, but if the centralized miner problem gets solved, I believe we'll see another 3-8 years of btc dominance before we've switched to a less wasteful system. In the long term you can't rely on centralized tech being necessary to move the currency forward. We're just not there yet. Centralized means corruption and collusion, every time. Just look at Coinbase.

There are transaction fees whenever you transfer from one address to another. With a paper wallet you only need your private and public key. With a "software" wallet, (they're all software wallets, stored on computers or hardware ledgers or phones),  you get a seed and possibly a password if you encrypt your wallet.  
No Bitcoin is ever stored off the chain. Everything you are safeguarding is your private key. Your private key even holds your public key.

Bitcoin is still the grandfather of cryptocurrency. It's not just another coin that got lucky. It's the coin that 1000s of other coins copied to get in the game. It's got the so called "network factor".  It is the backbone of several exchanges and can work fine as a store of value.

Look at the recent history of OMG (and many other alts). A downturn for a long time waiting for "the real" bitcoin fork. Bitcoin gold forks and alts go up and down in a day. Stagnation. S2X is canceled. Alts go up and down again. Including NEO and OMG. There is no support for alts currently except for a few breakout ones that will also drop. I had money to buy alts after the S2X cancellation but I didn't, I felt that it was weak. It was. You can't hide from BTC in alts.

Places like Coinbase.com are just the current(temporary) solution to exchanging Bitcoin. Exchanges will become decentralized as well over time. Some already are. Technologies like Atomic Swaps will allow users to forego exchanges altogether. Bitcoin is still a toddler in that aspect. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:58:35
A hardware wallet still doesn't "hold" your bitcoins. It holds your public and private key, seed and possibly an added password on top.
Just like a local wallet on your PC will have a seed and a password (if you encrypt it).
Everything still comes down to your public and private key, just like with a paper wallet.

Back when I first tested the procedure I transferred an insignificant amount from an exchange to a fresh paper wallet. Then I swept that paper wallet into Electrum, verified that it worked and then sent what was left to my "main" paper wallet.

Those fishing websites work like this:
1. Redirect your login to a site like Coinbase to their fraudulent site made to look like Coinbase.
2. Make you enter your username and password. (in the background they login to Coinbase using the information you have just given them)
3. Google authenticator pops up on the fake site. You put in your real code. (in the background they use the real code on the real Coinbase to continue logging in.)
4. They tell you that the authenticator code didn't work and give you a waiting period to try again, giving them time to start selling coins and whatever, consolidating your wealth. 
5. On the fake site they want you to put in your authenticator code again, after like 30 seconds. (They use this real code to confirm their transfers / sells / buys on the real Coinbase site.)
Same process for all the other fishing sites out there, like the ones for Bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:51:00
In around 8 days a hostile fork is happening(most likely) to Bitcoin. Whatever happens just before or after that is anyone's guess. So I suggest you wait until that situation has semi-settled.

If you are really brand new, give it 14 days and then start putting in your $50 every paycheck. It will add up, I didn't realize my average until I went back and calculated it and it was quite low. If you don't have a large sum to invest all at once, that's that, invest small amounts that you can live without. The average person can't just go in now and buy several Bitcoins.

There are plenty of ways to shut all that down if you are worried about it. If I was worried about it, I wouldn't be using stuff like Dropbox or Gmail or Google. I wouldn't be able to use anything besides my own small server setup. If you're running everything through TOR, that's fine.. or some VPN provider.. sure. But are you really safe? TOR users on the Silk Road thought they were. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:12:03
Install Electrum, go to "Wallet" -&gt; "Private keys" -&gt; "Sweep".
Leave "to" address intact, that is one of your Electrum addresses.
Type in or paste your private key - &gt; "OK" -&gt; "Broadcast".
Go to blockchain.info, put in your public paper wallet address and you will see that the process has started.
Your paper wallet will empty, you will pay a transfer fee and what's left will be in your Electrum wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:14:38
He ded, yo.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:00
You can sweep your paper wallet using a wallet like Electrum. After that the paper wallet amount will be in your Electrum local wallet. Then you can go ahead and transfer to another paper wallet, exchange, hardware wallet and so on.
I don't think paper wallets are unsafe as long as you have them stored securely, preferably in multiple locations if you have a decent amount of BTC.

If you want to give BTC away as gifts, just make paper wallets for them. A paper wallet is basically a public address and a private key printed on a piece of paper. Like bitaddress.org 
When they want they can sweep the amount in those accounts into local software wallets like Electrum.

I dunno, what if it ends up being a shitshow on both sides of the fork? I agree that if it ends up like the BCH fork, the ideal choice is to have as many BTC as possible when the split happens. Still, wallet holders got screwed that time because exchanges like Bittrex had BCH for sale very early where it rose to around $1100 and dropped soon afterwards.

The Bitcoin Gold developers have always said they would premine, even in their paper they talk about a moderate amount around 1% of total supply. Since it's a fork of BTC, they don't have their own Genesis block, just a fork of BTC to mine. How can they premine if the fork hasn't already happened?
What happens later tomorrow is not a real fork, imho, but I don't know what to call it. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:20:26

Did the developers start selling their pre-mine? Where else would the coins come from?
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:21:15
You should hedge your bets mate. I really would suggest you PM me or someone that you trust to not just hold them. You need to sell some, not all, but some to cover your initial investments. Get to a point where you don't have to really care what happens to the rest, then you can feel safe. 
What you are doing right now is just hoping for the best with no real plan.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:01:46
Wouldn't they just fumble and mention "security risks" and withhold 2X for as long as possible to prevent people from selling? I mean if they honestly think that 2X will prevail.

They say they will not rule out a "modest" pre-mine in that document and they are set to fork the coin on the 25th. Are they saying they are pre-mining now? I didn't think that was possible, I thought you'd have to fork before you basically "existed" and if they haven't forked, how are they mining?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:09:46

:) I wake up, seeing it trading at Bittrex out of the blue(they didn't even have the clickable link ready, you had to search for it), I thought it would take weeks. It had just reached around $1100 and was dropping fast. SELL SELL SELL. I actually think it was a good thing in hindsight, I would probably have sold sooner if I had just been sitting and watching it the whole time.

Bittrex gave users BCH very quickly. Coinbase is still masturbating on their next dastardly move. Bittrex users got to sell BCH at up to around $1100. Coinbase users, well, they don't even know how low it is going yet. Consider this before storing coins on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:59:40
What if this is a two-pronged attack? Pump BCH, Pump S2X, make people believe that BTC is no longer the one true ring.

BTC was crashing so the CEO said; "I'm gonna shut this thing down" and turned off the power. The employees were like; "Dude!" but the CEO yelled "I do what I want!"
It turned into a mosh pit brawl and eventually someone called all their mothers. They came in and started slapping everyone and after a while there was a period of silence and reflection. 
Finally the CEO said "OK, let's put this shit back online."
Beaten and bruised a lowly engineer pulled the lever. "Godspeed BTC".  
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:47:56
That or put it into an exchange that promise support for the coin. Bittrex is one of them. I don't know where GDAX stands on this because I don't use it. (Bittrex BTC transfers are closed until the fork so if you used them, you'd have to convert to something else to transfer there.)

Not according to this: 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:32:25

A lot of people seem to think that the dastardly plan is to pump BCH amidst the confusion of this coming S2X hardfork. For the sake of speculation what will be the most profitable option to you, if you can only choose one of the following? 
1. Do nothing with your BTC except if you have altcoins, then sell them all for BTC before the fork, offload S2X as soon as you are able to after fork.
2. Sell everything into FIAT like USD or EUR before the fork. Get back into it when things have cooled down.
3. Buy up as much BCH as you can before the fork and dump before pump stops.
4. Escape into another altcoin like LTC (or do USDT) and hug it out until it blows over.
5. Throw it all into S2X and hope that it comes out on top.
What say ye?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:33:32
Disputed afaik. How would they premine if the fork hadn't already happened? (Oct 1st is what some are saying)
