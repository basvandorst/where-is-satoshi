Its because crypto isn't classified as a currency in the eyes of the government. It is taxed as property.

It would be sweet to have this but each part of it highlighted so it explains what it is.

You can't talk about unit price because it's arbitrary for gold. Yes one Bitcoin is 3 times the unit they decided to use to sell gold. But if you take how many bitcoins there are, I think 16 million? And divide all the gold in the world by that, an equivalent unit of gold is probably at least one order of magnitude higher value than Bitcoin.

Just got my paycheck, so that means I buy regardless of the price.

Good, you got the point. 
Do you think your bank has a special lockbox just for you set aside just in case you want to take out your money? What if every one went to the bank and wanted all their money out, do you think they would let that happen, or be able to hand out that much cash?
Exchanges are banks. They take your bitcoins and throw them in the same pile with everyone else's. There isn't a private key just for you sitting there with just your coins in it.

I don't really see how forking is a good thing in most cases. Look at how hard it is for people to understand how this fork works. And these are people that are into bitcoin as pretty much a hobby, they are doing research, reading whitepapers and articles and learning how everything works. How are we going to handle something like this when/if we reach the goal of bitcoin being ubiquitous and being used by everyone.
If we just fork everytime there is a dispute, nothing will ever be stable. If it's never stable, it will never be looked at seriously as a real contender to fiat.

A node only verifies blocks, they don't create them.

  I use: =GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:BTCUSD","price",DATE(2017,4,1),TODAY()+2,"daily")
In it's own sheet. It will make a table of dates and prices, then in my other sheet I just vlookup the date to get the price on a specific day.

People often forget there is a second part to the saying:

Why would I use a long term candle to make long term predictions? I'm gonna plan for my retirement with 1 minute candles! /s

Think of it this way, if you hodl bigmaccoin™ it will always be worth 1 big Mac, no matter what a big Mac sells for in Fiat. So big Mac coin will always hold it's value relative to a big Macs value in dollars. 
Backing a currency just means that your currency is always able to be exchanged for what's backing it.  This works in this case as McDonald's is not likely to be unable to make a big Mac when you turn one in. Now if for whatever reason they made billions of these things, it could lose it's backing if everyone all turned their coins in at once, and thats pretty much what Happened to the dollar. So as long as they don't make so many coins that they can't keep up with burger production, you can say they are backed by big Macs.

If anyone from trezor looks at this, can you not use a link tracking service in your emails? The email says, "the button below links to [blog.trezor.io]( but actually links to [ where the XXXX are I'm assuming a way to identify which emails click which links and such probably for marketing stuff.   
While I get the data probably is useful to you, it seems really shady when you state it links to one place, but when you hover, it links elsewhere. I actually questioned if the legit email letting me know about the attack was actually a phishing attempt.

You only lose value when you make that value real again. Just like I didn't make $300 last month when we were flying high, because I didn't sell it and make it real. None of it is real until you make it real.

I don't think people realize it's a symbiotic relationship. Without miners, we can't transfer/spend coins. Without us, the coins are worthless. One cannot exist without the other. 
Miners need to see that if they fuck over the people using the currency, we will just leave. We need to see that the miners need to make enough to keep all that processing power going to make the system work.

I think it depends on your exchange and where you are from. I think all the US based exchanges are FDIC insured because they are actually banks. So any fiat that would get lost from a bank going under would be protected.

This is the thing I keep wondering, but see nobody talk about. How do I choose which blockchain I'm spending on? I don't want to transfer BCC and lose my BTC in the aether. 
Currently I'm planning on just holding on to both, but I still want to know in case I need to move stuff around.

It's easy, don't spend more than you are willing/able to lose. I'm not really going to notice if I lost $50 from my paycheck every other week. My standard of living would be exactly the same with or without that $50. So I buy bitcoins with it. When I do so, that $50 is dead to me. I write it off as if I will never see it again. I don't even really pay attention to prices and trends when I buy, I do it every other saturday, regardless if it's a peak or a valley.

Not really because since it's below 9000 right now, the only way to cross it one more time is to go above 9000 and stay there forever, because it could never cross 9000 again to go below it.
