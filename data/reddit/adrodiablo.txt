Downloaded the app. Very nice design. Good job!

If you want to diversify into less volatile options and still get good returns, I would see a financial adviser. I did this when I first got a full time job 8 years ago and I've averaged about 12 % per annnum returns since. This all goes towards my retirement fund (Superannuation in Australia). 
My investment into Bitcoin is my guilty gamble/pleasure and I'll keep investing with my extra cash after my mortgage costs.

I've never seen anything available in Australia for purchase with Bitcoin, although I am in Perth which is always behind the times compared to cities on the east coast.
Right now I use Bitcoins online (rarely), but mostly I've got them stored away as a potential investment once the price gets to $1,000,000,000 per coin.
I would LOVE it if I could use them in my daily life, but right now it's slow progress here.

Worked in three mines. Almost every mine goes through tough times like any other business. The decade long boom is done and dusted and 10's of thousands are out of a job.
I worked for Newmont in Australia when the gold prices was around the AUD$700 mark and it was costing us about $650/tonne to get the stuff mined, processed and sent to port. A lot of work for not much reward. But obviously strategy and assets play a large roll in holding onto mines as well.
Mining sounds like easy $$$$$ but it's high risk-high reward and you need GOOD people from top to bottom for it to work and make bank. Also a lot of things out of your control like a strong Aussie dollar. The fact it's in the low 70's now is pretty much the only reason I still have a job (export costs).
Just read any mining article about Australian mining at the moment. It's not pretty.
Some good anecdotal evidence; FMG sacked 700 people as they got off the plane to work, even waking a guy up at 3 am to tell him to pack his shit and go home. No friends in this business.

Jesus Christ. The NYTimes is a boarderline rag these days. Many other lesser respected papers have had glowing things to say about BTC recently.
The whole 'ergh, illegal, laundering, ergh, drool...' has been done and dusted. I hope the writer gets a pineapple up their ass from their co-workers come Monday.

Just yesterday I was explaining the pros of BTC/LTC vs standard fiat and the easiest way I got his attention was explaining that there's literally billions of people from the Philippines, Africa, Malaysia etc. who do not have a bank account. They get taken to the cleaners every time they use a middle-man like Western Union, not to mention the time delay on transfers.
In a society where we're always looking for the easiest, cheapest and best way to do things, this is a big attention grabber.

They've explained it many times on the show so the audience does have a clue. It's more about standing up to government. Cenk goes  into more detail about the naming of the show and acknowledged it could me misconstrued. I'll try and find some evidence to back this up and you can make your own mind up.

1 - They wouldn't have lost money unless they sold their coins.
2 - The confidence in Greek banks is non-existent. They aren't even open any more.
3 - I'm not saying they should have all put money into BTC, but I'd definitely be putting it somewhere else besides the banks. Especially since the Banks are being told to use the monies they hold from the Greek population to help pay off the debt. Straight up legal theft.
It's a shit situation all around. But putting my money into a Greek Bank? Fuck.That.

As a Resource Geologist. This is utter crap... I'm all for Bitcoin and it possibly being the next 'gold' in the sense of protection against financial catastrophe, but the of mining gold on EARTH is hard and expensive enough let alone on asteroids millions of kilometers away, moving at thousands of km/s and then to get the gold back from the asteroid after just magically landing in the middle of the gold motherload. They're not gold nuggets flying through space...

I have a Trezor and use Electrum. Well worth the time to get a setup like this going.

If we had the answer we'd all be millionaires ;-)
Playing the day trading game is near impossible at the best of times, even for the pros. Just keep grabbing some coin when you can and hold on. I believe in the technology behind Bitcoin and that will make the price go up long term, along with the constant global economic instability (see Russia recently and the huge increase in RUB transactions). 
The tech will take a good +5 years at least to be implemented into everyday corporate life but I believe it will happen. Then things will get really interesting.

I'm in on it too. I just got an e-mail today stating there's delays but it's sorted and they should arrive in 7-10 business days. I can't wait to get it and show it off. 
I also feel like seeing a Bitcoin Card will will give Bitcoin a form of 'validity' to those who don't currently own any. It could break down some of those mental barriers people have about giving it a go.

Was thinking about the NFS/PayPass issue and thought that it could be due to a Patent/Legal issue so only corporations like VISA/Mastercard can have this technology without you paying out a large fee for the technology.
That or CoinJar just wanted to get the ball rolling in the easiest and quickest fashion. Which from a business perspective is totally fine. Especially if you view this as the Alpha version of BTC cards.
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:04:49
Nope. It doesn't. Got my card. It's a minor thing, but to be honest, I fucking love PayPass.

That's a good accidental point you've just made. I'm in WA also and I got my card on Friday. I've put some money on it but I just realised I have no idea what transaction option you'd need to choose.
It's probably in the paperwork that comes with it, but I just sort of... tossed it out.
Finally, one little PSA announcement; I've found out by accident that once your BTC is transferred to the card as AUD, you CAN NOT convert it back to BTC. It is locked in the card. I hope this changes in the future. I did put a bit more on the card than I really wanted (got a bit over excited) and now I just have to use it up rather than convert it back into my TREZOR cold storage.

I'm still going to stay with them. From a customer perspective, their customer support is amazing and the new app is pretty sweet. I'm pretty sure they're sick of me e-mailing them with bugs I find and questions/suggestions I have. Their responses are always very quick and very helpful.
When it comes to the important bit of actually losing your BTC, do as I do and keep a minimal amount in there for minor purchases and put the vast bulk of your other coins in cold storage like TREZOR. Best $130 (or whatever it is) I ever spent. The stress of losing &gt;$10k in coins has vanished. Peace of mind.

Wow, thanks for all the great responses people. I've been using Bitcoin for a good 6 months and just generated a new address each time due to reading that it's better for privacy.
