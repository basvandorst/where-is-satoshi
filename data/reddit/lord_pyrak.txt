It's not the price that matters, it's the user count and ease of access. If you're wishing the value of bitcoin was higher simply from the amount of coins you own, you're doing it wrong.

A '40x raise ' means nothing if that 'x' represents a mere penny. Think of how many pennies you have stepped on while walking, and compare that to the transfer rate. i would HAPPILY pay $5 per BTC transaction considering I can move it to any country on the planet with the only value limit being how much i'm willing to shell out to whatever the popular exchange is this week.

Using  against 
I'd have to say no. Not even close unless you don't have to pay for the power that it uses (via solar or something). But even then it would take over a year before you get any profit, possibly more due to price drops / unusually high difficulty increases
