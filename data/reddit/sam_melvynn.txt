BTC price in Bitfinex is almost $80 higher than in Coinbase. Can anyone explain to me why this is so? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:06:31
I should have bought more at 7400
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:47:08
Will a dump be coming soon? ��
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:42:39
So much for BTC rising after the G20 meeting
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:30:32
noob question... but what's TA and MA? ��
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:44:32
do you guys think we have bottomed this week? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:33:07
??? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:43:15
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:24:11
every time you post on reddit the price goes down ������
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:46:34
dumped? in what exchange? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:13:01
Are we ever gonna get past 9k today??? ��
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:02:30
and I bought in literally just a few minutes before the article came out on the internet, talk about shitty timing ��
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:11:23
Does the news that the NY attorney general launched an investigation into the major crypto exchanges have to do with the price going down? 
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:33:11
well fuck you too. you must be one of the stupid hodl fan boys who like to ride it all the way down ������
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:33:52
should I set a close sell stop already or is this downward trend only temporary? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:01:18
my sell order order has been triggered already, I'll buy back at 8500 if it goes that low. I may have sold too soon ��
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:11:24
yeah, I thought it was time for a correction and I didn't wanna ride it all the way back down to 8300. That was dumb ����
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:49:35
Well fuck me. I just sold all my coins at 9200 thinking it is about to crash after I read the article. Now it is at 9400. ������
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:18:17
Do you think it will get past 8500 this week??? ��
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:34:50
FUD alert! CNBC with an article linking bitcoin with fentanyl trading ��
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:26:57
relax,  pump ain't done yet ��
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:16:53
shit, price is going down...fast ����
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:45:23
������, stupid shit. I've already made profit when I sold at 9200. All shitty little hodlers like you do is keep whining when the price drops. Hodl my dick u dipshit, guess who's gonna buy back in when it goes below 9k. ��������
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:36:35
Just googled bitcoin news and it came up. The article was written only a few hours ago. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:50:08
to the moon!!! 
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:19:34
is it true that the Mt. Gox whale is preparing to sell some btc? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:34:16
I'm relatively new to this, I first bought btc last January but I've been buying the dips (but not all) ever since. I'm gonna break even when the price reaches 9000. Now I've set my sell stop at 8700, is that OK or should I just hodl for now? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:34:32
dump time already???������
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:37:37
the bid ask spread here in the Philippines is over $300, talk about being ripped off
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:50:29
I know, but I'm not selling. I'll just cut back on coffee...and meth. lol
