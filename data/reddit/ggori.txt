An IOTA can’t be split into 0.1 iota for example
So that changes a lot go the perspective.
Besides that, IOTA is ment to do microtransactions for IoT, so the supply needs to be huge - else the minimum transaction would be too high

It is becoming a 'real' currency.

No you cant.  
I used the machine for the sake of fun, but there was no selling option.
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:07:13
Thanks dude  
Quite big post though, I did CRTL-F some keywords, but couldn't find anything.  
Do you know any keywords to search for? If not, I'll just read the entire thing later.
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:37:07
No I didn't.  
Could you please give me a link to it? Sounds really interesting.
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:09:41
Sure, but not everyone is as gangster as you..rofl these talks
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:34:35
Ok bye

Mad cus you fell for the 'moon soon' meme?
Teach yourself to see bitcoin as a 'property' which can't be taken from you. See it as a form of supporting the 'fight' against the centralized payment methods.
Stop seeing it as a way to get more fiat, this will make it much easier for you guys to HODL and stops you from making posts in which you ask why bitcoin didn't moon yet.
@_date: 2019-03-08 11:39:09
It will go up eventually
Possibly there even is another dip to come, who knows...
But the people who actually believe in the future value of Bitcoin are the ones who are pushing down the price...they want to buy more, no matter what
They have no other reason to manipulate it to the downside
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:11:21
That looks nice for a 14 year old.
I would prefer a solid colored towel with just the logo printed on it (not full size)

 I accept this person 
@_date: 2019-03-07 11:08:13
We should thank those whales. They are kicking out the weak hands. We don't need these panic sellers. The real Bitcoin lovers, the guys who believe in the revolution, do not really care about the BTCUSD price anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:21:41
Hodl for what? The amount of bitcoin in your wallet doesn't change. I hate it that some people are simply here for moon and want to dump at higher prices in exchange for some inflated fiat scam currency
@_date: 2018-10-13 21:43:01

Sure, I do understand that you do need fiat for a living and I do understand that you try to make a buck on Bitcoin. Yet, as you just said, one should always blame themselves for losing money on investing on speculative assets especially.  
The thing that bothers me, is that people go on Reddit and ask 'When moon', 'When lambo', 'I was promised to become rich wtf?'. That is what I consider childish. I can't see why my posts are being childish, but it's fine, I can totally take that from you.  
Unfortunately, I am not financially dependent on others anymore, it was a nice and peaceful time :)  
Yet, I made the decision to only invest money which I can afford to lose. I swear, even though it sounds weird, I don't really mind if bitcoin goes to zero. Sure, I prefer to see it to go up, but I already considered my investment money as 'lost'. Reason for that is, that I am not planning to cash out anytime soon, simply because I am not here because I &gt;NEED&lt; the money to life, as I made the smart decision to use the money which I can afford to lose.  
From an investment perspective (as you are trying to make money), I would either recommend you to do DCA or buy after 40% corrections. You made the rookie mistake to buy at the end of a bull run and didn't take your gains because you were hoping for lambo's.  
I wish you the best luck, I just hope people will stop using Reddit to cry about the bitcoin price and ask others why it isn't mooning yet.
@_date: 2019-08-08 11:04:34
Correct. So does Ledger.
Get either one of those.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:18:59
Dude, it's the CEO who said so
@_date: 2019-10-28 13:06:19
Possibly they received it as a form of payment. Anyone can make a bitcoin wallet, which means that anyone can request to be paid in bitcoin. There are a lot of 'legal activities' which is being paid for in bitcoin. India is known for providing likes/views/votes or other online services. These are often paid for using bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:21:50
This was already possible few weeks ago right?
@_date: 2019-06-01 11:53:58
Always have a public phone wallet with you, holding 1% of your portfolio
So you can fool the people this is all you have when u'r getting robbed
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:26:27
The fact they don't let each other finish their sentence tilts me so much haha
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:50:17
Craig is that you?
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:38:01
You can do it, but buy from an official reseller.
On the site of ledger wallet, you can check all official resellers.
Also, when it gets delivered - check if its properly sealed
@_date: 2019-02-02 14:20:55
This does actually look so scary haha
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:03:17

This has been possible at Brisbane Airport for over a year now. It's cool though.

I accept this person
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:58:19
Yes it's possible
The question which has to be asked is: why do you want to mine?
If you do it only for the profits, then it's not worth it. Your energy cost is much higher than what you make. Expect to make upto 0.25USD per day. Your laptop will use more energy than that.
If you do it with the mindset to contribute to the network, then: Yes, please do it
If you do it for educational purposes or similar: sure, why not?
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:49:33
Yes, but you could have had more BTC if you bought today rather than yesterday.  
So it still matters in this case
@_date: 2018-11-14 14:00:21

Craig and Roger are the worst two guys of the crypto industry, they screw up the entire industry for many. Pretty sure ETF will get denied, as today is a proof that bitcoin can be manipulated by two mental kids.  
Hopefully there is someone more brave than me who will try to stop them from manipulating

Een BTC ATM is een soort pinautomaat, maar andersom. Je kunt er eigenlijk met contant geld bitcoins kopen. Je stopt er bijvoorbeeld een briefje van 50 in en dan krijg je dat bedrag (minus de fees) gestort op je bitcoin wallet.
Steden waar je een Bitcoin ATM kunt  vinden:
Amsterdam, Breda, Brunssum, Eindhoven, Maastricht, Noordwijk, Oudenbosch, Rotterdam, Tilburg, Utrecht
I just explained him what a Bitcoin ATM is and where he can find one in the Netherlands.
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:31:42
What would that mean for the price?
I see you state 'Price rises anticipation' but why would this news make BTC price rise?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:53:18
You gotta be kidding me.
Your prices are in GBP instead of USD.
3397 GBP = 4300~ USD
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:34:24
u'r soo weak xD
trying to FUD, simply because you cashed out
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:14:08
As people say, its a meme which started by the guy who missspelled it. Most people currently use it because of that, as it sounds fun.
Another way people started to define it is:
Hold On (for your) Dear Life
But that aint the original meme

Dude, ik had de foto van die bus op schiphol gepost.  
Denk je serieus dat ik dat in opdracht doe voor Satos?  
Ik vind het mooi om dit soort advertenties te zien, zag het met toeval op die bus staan dus fototje in een whatsapp groep gezet en daarna hier op reddit. Vandaag iets teveel azijn gedronken?
