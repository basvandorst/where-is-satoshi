That's a good point. In theory you could also wait for the price to go up enough to cover all your fees too, but then that would be risky. 
Also, as I pointed out the time it took was much faster than the standard bank transfer.

@_date: 2014-01-04 22:34:13
There was about 5 mins of time between buying the BTC and selling it on my coinbase so there wasn't much price difference (if anything, at the moment it probably gained a little value before I sold it). 
Also good point on the exchange rate; I'm not sure if they charged me for the currency exchange or not or even if I got a good rate for that, which would be interesting to know. Whether or not BTC is cheaper to use might depend on the exchange rates at the time.

I really, really want to see remittances take off for Bitcoin, but I don't see it happening easily or soon, especially not while the price is this volatile. I think there's huge potential here though. 
Potentially, if a company like Coinbase started setting up in other countries, you would have a much more feasible option for sending fiat money from US bank accounts to foreign, something which a lot of people (including myself) would be hugely interested in. 
On the other hand though, if your family back home could spend Bitcoin at their local store to buy groceries, you could send money home for next to nothing (though again, you really need the price to stop being so volatile) 
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:56:46
Absolutely. I think it's really understated how groundbreaking Bitcoin really is; it is utterly unprecedented in its monetary scale and implications. 
Much like how the Internet allowed anyone to communicate with anyone else frictionlessly, Bitcoin is now not only levelling the ground in money but making it frictionless.

I used localbitcoins to buy BTC in the UK 
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:57:52
Late last year I was having my morning coffee and browsing the Internet when I stumbled over an article about the guy who remembered he had mined some bitcoins ages ago and bought an apartment with the profits. 
I think that must have been the second or third time I had heard of it because I later found some text files with links to Bitcoin related websites for further research, including a spreadsheet with some quick figures for what my profit would be if BTC went to $150 (lol) but I couldn't remember much more than that so this was the first time I had really looked into it. 
I had some money set aside for an interesting speculative asset, and Bitcoin was utterly fascinating the more I read into it. In fact I think I lost an entire weekend reading every article I could find and watching every video on YouTube about cold storage and hot wallets I could find. I had trouble sleeping. The implications were (are) just too big. I'm totally hooked.

I think what you're saying is that Bitcoin is a function of the Internet, not its successor. 
I agree, but another way to look at it is the internet's first killer app was the free flow of information. It's second killer app now is the unbridled free flow of value, as Andreas was talking about in this lecture. 
If the Internet was an Apollo space shuttle for instance, then Bitcoin is not the newer and better space shuttle. Instead, imagine what that space shuttle can do once you attach some gigantic motherfucking rockets to the sides of it... It could go anywhere, maybe even one day the moon :) 
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:28:29
The most interesting analogy to me is comparing bitcoin to the nascent web. All the HTTP protocol does is allow two computers to talk to each other. If I told you about it in it's early days, it would be hard for you to understand why that would eventually go on to allow things like email to exist. Why that would allow sites like ebay, amazon, facebook, youtube, skype etc to exist in the future. 
All bitcoin is, in it's essence, is to allow anyone to make entries into an immutable ledger with global consensus. One application of that is that we can have a near-instant, decentralized digital currency that is infinitely divisible.  Despite whatever flaws you can see with it, that is revolutionary technology, and most of the things we see coming from it today are quite primitive in comparison to what we'll probably see in years to come... It's hard to predict what the amazons, ebays and facebooks of bitcoin are going to look like. 
I predict before we see any of that though, we are going to see the on and off-ramps into and out of bitcoin from fiat currency get easier. Services like Coinbase and Circle are helping but many countries still don't have easy on and off ramps. 
**Rebittance**; I predict one of the early uses of bitcoin to begin with though will be 'rebittance' when someone (and you could argue we're already seeing this with Bitpesa and rebit) figures out a near seamless way to transmit money between countries using bitcoin. 
**Bitcoin as the Patreon/crowdfunding killer.** I would hope one day bitcoin (or platforms built on bitcoin) is used to fund people directly instead of having to go through middle men. 
**Bitcoin as the ultimate offshore bank account and capital flight machine.** If one day, bitcoin wasn't so bubbly and had a more or less consistent rise in value over time, I could see it being a tax haven of sorts. Is your country looking like it might go tits up? Convert your fiat to bitcoin and maybe send it to any number of exchanges where it can near-instantly converted to a more stable fiat currency. Or, keep it in a cryptographically secure address that you can carry out of the country completely in your own memory, that can't be detected by sniffer dogs at the airport, that theoretically can't even be provably linked to you. If enough of your country's populace start doing it, maybe your local shops would prefer to be paid in bitcoin? Even with BTC's horrific loss of value over the last 18 month long bear winter, you would still have outperformed currencies like the venezuelan peso. Even better; while your government is spending all its time and tax dollars on stopping boats loaded with physical money entering the country, they are more or less powerless to stop bitcoin unless they shut down the internet or worse.
What's really interesting about this scenario is that we really haven't seen what happens to bitcoin during a currency collapse when there's incentive to get your assets out of a failed economy... at least yet. Bitcoin has never been around during a global recession. But we have seen what happens when there are hints of a failed economy, i.e. Cyprus, and Greece, and almost invariably bitcoin's value went up during these periods. 
**Bitcoin stock market** imagine if a company does an IPO over bitcoin using colored coins... anyone in the world with access to bitcoin could take part and help them raise capital. People living in countries with few investment opportunities could buy a fraction of a share in a company and build a portfolio that would otherwise be unavailable to them  simply because of the country they were born in. This also means that companies that would otherwise not exist might now find capital because they can be funded by anyone in the world.

Bitcoin is still awaiting its “killer app” to catapult the virtual currency into the mainstream, but Fred Ehrsam has a guess as to what it might be: ending spam.
“In 10 years I think we are going to be sitting here and the internet will look a lot prettier because bitcoin came into existence,” says the 27-year-old co-founder of Coinbase, a San Francisco-based bitcoin company that has attracted more than $100m in venture capital.
While some of the attention on bitcoin still focuses on its yo-yoing price, the focus of venture capitalists has shifted to the potential for the underlying technology, known as the blockchain, which validates and records transfers of the virtual currency without any of the costs of having to go through the banking system. It could enable tiny fractions of bitcoin to be embedded, at virtually no cost, into almost any internet activity.
“The internet has never had economics properly embedded into it,” says Mr Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs trader. “Say you pay one one-hundredth of a cent to send an email, spam email dies overnight. Who would bulk create a bajillion Yahoo email accounts? It is no longer economically viable.”
Mr Ehrsam is unsurprisingly bullish on the utility of the blockchain, but he is hardly alone. Developers are experimenting with using the blockchain to speed up the settlement of stock trades, to process by-the-second payments for peer-to-peer video streaming, and to create marketplaces or social networks that operate without a central authority, plus hundreds more potential applications.
More than $390m of venture capital funding has flowed to these bitcoin experiments so far this year, according to researchers at bitcoin news site Coindesk, already eclipsing the $360m that was invested last year.
Coinbase can afford to be neutral on what uses eventually emerge. It styles itself as the “on-ramp to the bitcoin world”, providing customers — both ordinary users and merchants who want to accept payment in it — with a way to exchange money into bitcoin and to store and transfer their virtual currency.
The company boasts 2.4m users in 25 countries, and a roster of backers that include leading venture capital firms, such as Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, and some established financial institutions including banks BBVA and USAA, and the New York Stock Exchange.
It is a long way from the anarchic chat forums and anti-government rhetoric of the early bitcoin believers to the swanky offices overlooking downtown San Francisco where Coinbase has its headquarters. The company will soon be taking extra space to house its growing army of compliance officers, lawyers and financially savvy developers.
While bitcoin may one day be embedded in all sorts of financial transactions, it is not clear if the currency will ever be a store of independent value or the alternative to fiat currencies that its pioneers dreamt it would be.
Bitcoin’s blockchain catches Wall Street’s eye
The blockchain — the technology that underpins bitcoin — has been called ‘the future for financial services infrastructure’. Banks, clearing houses and exchanges are becoming increasingly excited that it could fundamentally transforming their business models.
Coinbase made a nod in that direction this month, though, in a publicity stunt surrounding the Greek debt crisis. It waived fees for euro-to-bitcoin transactions, and Mr Ehrsam says there was a 300 per cent spike in trading volume.
“With Cyprus and now this, there is a growing awareness and understanding of what it really means to have money in your bank account,” Mr Ehrsam says. “You’ve now had two countries in the eurozone where all of a sudden you actually can’t access your money and somebody could haircut it by 30 per cent and turn it into something else and you have no control over that.”
Mr Ehrsam straddles the financial and the tech worlds, like a human metaphor for bitcoin. His stint on a Goldman currency trading desk smooths Coinbase’s dealings with banks, while his teenage years as a US champion gamer, sponsored by hardware companies to appear at tournaments, give him geek credibility in San Francisco. From his personal stash of bitcoin — the 20 per cent of his salary he immediately converts back into US dollars — he recently purchased a new Dell Alienware computer for playing video games.
Only a couple of years ago, being able to buy computers and holidays and homewares online using bitcoin was difficult, but the excitement around and investment in the blockchain has raised everyone’s sights. Is bitcoin closing in on a killer app?
“It is like asking, in 1992, how the internet was going to affect the way we do data distribution,” says Mr Ehrsam. “Uber was impossible before the internet; eBay was impossible before the internet ... I can’t sit here and tell you all the killer applications but I know that the possibilities are near endless.”

Almost everything with banking as it is right now is like this. If they weren't monolithic institutions who could blockade any new banking upstarts then there's no way we would still have this awful system. 
They are absolutely ripe for disruption. Even forgetting bitcoin for a second, I am really looking forward to the day when Apple and Google realise that, hey, why are we building all this infrastructure around dealing with banks for our Google Wallet and ApplePay stuff when we could just keep the customer's money ourselves and build our own cool banking fintech? 
I would be hugely suprised if they're not already thinking about this or in the heavy stages of planning how they're going to get around the banks entirely.

1. It's open and decentralised. I can use my currency how I want, at whatever time I want. There are still some hitches, people can spam the network and block size is being debated, but in a general way the basics are there. 
2. Because of 1, Bitcoin allows for permission less innovation. A payment network that anyone with internet can access, that anyone in the world can build protocols, software and business on, is amazing, because allowing people these things normally meant compromising the security of the network. People really don't see how mind-blowingly incredible this is yet. 
3. Virtually un-seizable. This is the first time there's been a recognised asset class that is practically un-touchable by bad actors, save for maybe a wrench attack. If you do things right, no-one can even prove you own those coins, and the keys to the 'safe' can even be stored inside your head as a password. This leads to one of my favourite features:
4. It is the first real opt-out option for people living in countries with an abusive currency system. Don't like how your government is inflating your currency? Think there might be a haircut tax coming? You can now store all or a portion of your savings in the fucking internet. For a lot of people in a lot of countries this is going to be revolutionary someday 
5. It's digital, which leading from point no.1 means that I can send digital assets to anyone in the world should I feel like it. If I want to support Snowden or Wikileaks, no one can stop me. This will absolutely lead to something politically game-changing someday, I don't doubt it. 
5.b) also I like the tech aspect of that, where I could be playing an MMORPG and buy things digitally off other players without having to disclose my personal details or use PayPal and pay a premium. Using lighthouse to crowd-fund my favourite YouTube video maker to buy a better camera. Sending money is now as easy as sending an email. Good luck waiting for the banks to make managing your money as easy as that, because when your payment system isn't open you're constantly waiting for them to do the innovation. FYI, they're not interested in building these features in anyway. 
So many more that I can't even think of yet. 
6. This is exciting for me to see, because although I'll never live long enough to see humanity reach a Tier 1 civilisation, I get super excited to get to see the small glimpses of that glorious era through things like the Internet, which is something close to a tier 1 communication system, and Bitcoin, which feels very close to what I'd imagine a Tier 1 civilisation's currency to be like, if they even need a currency by that point.

This should throw some more wood on the "fuck the fucking banks" fire. 
Although Bitcoin is volatile as hell at the moment, it's becoming less so over time and if it becomes a stable digital commodity, it's comforting to know that it couldn't be used as a politician's toy to bail out their banking mates at the general public's expense.

I called three days ago and they had me confirm that I had sent money to someone on local bitcoins and bitstamp via SEPA.

3. Get 5 physical dice, and use [diceware]( to create 8-9 word passphrases for each address you want to create. 12 words if you're feeling really paranoid
4. Boot into fresh copy of linux, do not go onto the internet. Open bitaddress html you saved earlier.
5. Enter passphrases into 'brainwallet' tab. Carefully. Save the private key and public address details offline, using an offline printer or any other offline method of your choosing. Put this somewhere safe. 
6. Erase the USB stick, and anything else you need to delete
7. Load the addresses with BTC from your online account (after checking the addresses several times over)

On the phone with them now will let you know. 
Weirdly I went through all this bullshit three days ago and they said it was all sorted, but it wasn't working all through the weekend and so I'm back to square one again. 
It might also have been me sending money to someone via localbitcoins too so will have to check and update depending on what they say so other people can learn from this too. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:04:48
Interesting. So you could argue that Bitcoin actually decreases the incentive to spend money as it (tends to) gain value over time, or could be worth a great deal more in time, and this causes deflation? 
If this is the opposite of capitalism, what is it called...?

Meh; someone talked me out of investing in apple when it was $120 a share.
I put my money into a risky portfolio instead. The 2008 crisis happened, I lost about a fourth of my money. Apple went sky high, although compared to Bitcoin I'd say it did "fairly well", lol. 
I did actually hold it against them, but eventually I realised how much of an idiot that made me look and got over it :) 
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:53:24
You're absolutely right; but it was my first real job and my first real investment so glad I learned the lesson early on. It definitely wasn't enough to cry myself to sleep at night over ;)

It's fascinating that we can watch people's accounts in real time
Is there a way to know whether that's an online wallet? That's INSANE
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:54:45
This is kindof my thinking. I think BTC will go to the moon (probably because I've been drinking the Kool Aid) and have set aside a small amount to invest; but I'd rather the price crash just one last time to let a few more of us late comers get our teeth into it :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:44:03
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:52:52
Correct, true random diceware passphrases are secure, and correct you can re-generate them later. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:23:53
I think the long term is the most exciting part of all. If bitcoin takes off in a big mainstream way, the implications are enormous. I think it would change the world as much or more than the internet has. 
That's why I'm not worried about the short term fluctuations (oh look it's going back up to 1,000USD again, ho hum) because I invested (yes, I'm holding as well as spending) in the idea of BTC not the short term profit margins.

Blockchain's app is still on the App Store, and it lets you send payments with it

The moon is 384,400km away; hence the biggest milestone should be $384,400

Glad you brought this up. I told my siblings to stop what they were doing and start researching Bitcoin when it was at $250 a coin and going up. They didn't, I did, and got most of my investment in before it hit $600. 
I can't say I blame them; this is a pretty new thing and most people don't get it yet. They've changed their tune now it's over $1000 and again when it went past gold parity. 
One lucky thing is that I got my mother to invest quickly, and she found a good bitcoin 'dealer' who we trust and gives us fair prices. She ended up with quite a lot of coins and is now sitting very pretty. She's about due for something wonderful to happen to her so I really hope I did the right thing by showing her how it all works. 
She ended up taking pity on my siblings and gave them half a coin each so they can join in on the excitement too. 
I can understand why they held out; there are just so many questions about where it's going or what's going to happen, but the problem is if you wait for those questions to be answered, you'll have missed the boat. I feel sad for them but understand and am glad they at least get a commiseration prize. 
Disclaimer: I'm not just a hoarder, I fully intend to use BTC as a currency, I'm just waiting for my exchange to be verified! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:03:00
Not sure either; they're being really vague this time and not telling me specifically what the problem is. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:08:54
This might be what I initially meant... Just a little red or green tag next to the post

I have a few: 
1. This is an innovative way to use money that isn't bogged down by banks and international fees. I can send money to someone halfway around the world for mere satoshis instantaneously. I can even do it anonymously!
2. The social and political implications if this takes off are staggering*. The idea that this is all de-centralised, that governments (currently) have no power over it and likely won't be able to is amazing to me. 
3. This is *fun*! And hugely interesting to watch. Every day there seems to be some new innovation in how we can use Bitcoins, in ways that traditional currency just couldn't accomplish. 
But you know what? My MAIN REASON is that I think this is going to be one of the Big Deals of my generation, like the advent of personal computers back in the 70's and 80's, and I want to be a part of it. 
*Edited as I forgot the original question of the post, doh
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:41:15
Why is deflation a bad thing? And I guess are you saying it couldn't be stabilised with a hard standard?
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:33:36
[This guy]( might be one of many street food vendors who would love to take Bitcoins as payment for a one-off day of selling at a bitcoin market or similar. If someone could find 10 or so of these vendors it wouldn't be too hard to get a 'bitcoin farmers market' set up somewhere, the local media would probably cover it too. 
If the city's population of bitcoiners all came to use their bitcoins it would be a huge success. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:57:21
I was actually wondering if they can just register on bitpay somehow just as an individual? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:09:29
Well put. I think the bitcoinaires of tomorrow will pave their own paths. 
I guess what I meant by 'next bill gates' is that gates is the stereotype for 'super wealthy'. Maybe another example I could have made is 'the next warren buffet'. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:23:15
Woops. Edited. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:38:13
Sure, why not. Also sounds like a good idea.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:34:36
The only thing really holding me back from spending is an easy way to exchange my fiat money... All the easy methods like local Bitcoin and bittylicious are way too expensive now
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:49:15
No, you should make it yourself. The idea of all this paranoia is to be, 100% sure, that no-one can touch your cold storage addresses by figuring out what combination you used for them, hence why we're doing everything offline. So by using a fresh Linux cd from ebay or similar, you might buy from someone that put some snooping software on it. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:26:15
Correct. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:45:49
Now that I've calmed down from the initial excitement of putting a few grand down on BTC, it's been genuinely exciting having some real money on something so volatile and interesting. If nothing else, I'm glad I'm going to be part of this story in 10 years time no matter what happens. I'm glad I put my money where my mouth is. 
I've also been learning a great deal about how the US financial system works, a subject which would have bored me a few months ago. I would never have known how we came from the gold standard to fiat currency and the plusses and minuses of both. I would never have known how screwed over americans are these days from the government printing money like there's no tomorrow.  
So I would say that even if it all goes to hell I've benefited a lot from all of this and it's been a very positive learning experience if nothing else. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:53:23
Unfortunately it's not going to be me... but hey I'm still going to have fun watching it all unfold :) 
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:08:52
When I was last looking into this, I read something along the lines that a diceware password of 8-9 words had enough entropy that it would actually take more money in energy to crack it than the person would likely get out of a given address. 
I suggest if you want to make a cold storage address using diceware; just make a long password of 8-9 or if you're feeling really paranoid 12, use the "brain wallet" tab and then generate your address that way. 
Do this on an offline computer for added security, preferably on a Linux boot USB or similar. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:01:54
Nice.
