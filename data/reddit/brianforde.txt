Hi All - I spoke with the MIT Bitcoin Club this week. As Nchinda mentioned, I wasn't planning on addressing the "State of Bitcoin." It was a placeholder he created for the title of talk. brg444 - You're right, that does sound "presidential" and clearly wasn't what I hoped to discuss. Instead, the plan was to give an update on the Digital Currency Initiative, which I think might have addressed a few of the issues discussed in this thread. While it's disappointing to not have an opportunity to talk about the DCI at the Expo, I'll try and answer a few of your questions here.
 
It sounds like the principle concern is the amount of engagement I’ve been able to sustain with the typical Bitcoin circles. It’s a fair criticism and something I'd like to improve. I think the challenge with starting an initiative is that you also have to focus on raising money, hiring a team, recruiting professors, and creating new classes that engage students.
 
Last fall, we had two classes on Bitcoin, with about 80 graduate students. The majority of those students are working on 10-12 research projects this semester. We haven't had a chance to announce them yet, but we're hoping to do so when we launch our website. So, that's a long way to say that there are tradeoffs. I'm happy with where the DCI is today, but I'm bummed that the tradeoff was not connecting more deeply with people at events or online. However, Jeremy Rubin, Joi Ito, and now, Neha Narula have been actively engaged, and they more than make up for my absence. And I’m looking forward to Jeremy’s talk on Sunday. Long before I arrived at MIT, he played a critical role in igniting interest in Bitcoin at MIT.
I'm happy to address some of the specific concerns raised in this thread:
 
--Speak on behalf of Bitcoin users: 
I would never claim to speak on behalf of Bitcoin users. Other than Satoshi, I'm not sure anyone is qualified to do that. I did attend Davos and had the opportunity to explain Bitcoin to many people who misunderstood the technology. Don Tapscott was also there, and Wences Casares was there the year before. I believe the more qualified people we have explaining Bitcoin to people who don't understand it, the more likely it will have supporters instead of detractors. If there’s ever an event I’m attending that you’d also like to attend or speak at, feel free to shoot me an email (bforde and I’ll be the first one to advocate for you to attend. 
 
--Boring essays and Bitcoin is not interesting:
I, too, get annoyed with people who say Bitcoin is not interesting, but blockchain is great. When asked, I usually remind people that the world was changed by the Internet, not an intranet. I can understand why many people may prefer private blockchains to address constraints, like throughput limitations or privacy concerns, I’m often also criticized for being too “pro-Bitcoin.” Part of the benefit of being at an academic institution is neutrality, and ultimately, we need to keep an open mind to all technologies in this space.
 
brg444 - Yes, if you are a deeply technical person, I can see how my blog posts might be boring. I've heard they're quite helpful to people who are not experts, but I can appreciate your perspective.
 
--Formerly worked in government:
Yep, I worked at the White House for President Obama. However, I didn't work for the NSA or have awareness of any of the programs that Edward Snowden revealed several years ago. There are more than 2.7 million people who work for the Federal government and about three thousand who work at the White House. I can understand why one might blame me for every policy action that took place under the President, but I think that is a pretty broad brush with which to paint someone.
 
I can also understand why public service is not for everyone, but a lot of smart and respected technologists, including folks like Ed Felten, have recently taken positions in government. The benefit in having people from the technical community working in government during an administration is that it provides the technical community’s perspectives when policy decisions are being made. Given the option of having technologists in or out of government, I would choose to have them in government for the powerful voice they add. But I can understand why people may disagree with me.
 
--Affiliation with the Blockchain Alliance:
I think there might be a misunderstanding about the role of this alliance. The goal is to provide be a resource for people in government to help them better understand the technology. In this situation, ignorance is not bliss. I know some may disagree with me, but I feel that the more informed people we have talking to people in government, the less government is likely to do things that are unreasonable as a result of being uninformed.
 
--Attempt at running Bitcoin development:
I'm not sure I've ever attempted that. However, I did offer Gavin, Wlad, and Cory positions at the MIT Media Lab, and have fundraised to pay their salaries so they can keep working on Bitcoin. I hope that is considered a helpful contribution to the community. We have zero influence over them -- feel free to ask them.
 
--Bitcoin Patents:
Earlier this summer, Andreas Antonopoulos asked me if I'd be open to working with him to address the patent issue. In response, we pulled together a survey for the community, brought together experts from the patent community who have worked to address patent trolls, and drafted up three options to address the issue. While we originally thought that MIT would be a good place to do this, we quickly realized that the Berkman Center, based at Harvard Law School, was much better suited, as MIT does not have a law school. They hosted the blockchain patent roundtable in November, where they used our draft to help start the conversation about how to address this issue.
 
--I'm not remotely close to Joi Ito's level:
Yep, you're right. I completely agree. Very few people are. :)
I hope I was able address a few of your questions. I’m always an email away (bforde for any questions or concerns you might have. And if you’re at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, please come up and say hi. I’d love to talk with you.
