Bill Maher is far from a visionary. as much as i like him he is just a funny man that goes with the flow. in no time he will be using it to buy his morning coffee im sure.

Yeah BLF has been doing this for a year now. There's a world map with hash rate chart integrated on it and KC was through the roof. I want my BFL!

because that's rite before critical mass. media attention will start late may early June plus staged delivery of bitcoin miner boxes from now until them creating more BCs in the market intern means more being spent with new adopters of the concurrency. when the new adopters of BCs report on frequency and quality of exchange it will then turn into a stream line catch up game.  at that point who knows what will happen not me not yet. to many variables and to many players to look farther into my crystal ball.
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:34:09
you nailed it with your words and your name adds to it 
@_date: 2013-06-04 01:21:55

From btc to usd and from usd to btc it's instant. When you transfer from your trading account to your bank account it takes 3-5 days max 
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:57:25
that's why i want to be in at vary vary top of ordering. almost a one shot deal. as far as i know its the same chips that they are using in the BFL boxes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:36:59
be the bubble and watch play by this chart. there are still time to make a ton of money.
we are somewhere between the first sell off of a 20%-30% dip (great time to go long as deep as you can) and the media boom. as soon as you hear this wile watching TV over a cup of hot Joe in the morning you  can smile because they are doing all the work for you and its off to the races.  
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:51:50
send me your info so i can get you set up. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:59:37

@_date: 2013-05-20 20:52:20
did you set it up so it was a privet transaction that can add allot of time to it? i waited 18 hrs for my first funding because i had a privet funding box checked. VIVA LA BITCOIN
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:50:41
How many do you have left. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 13:03:56
this is just what Bitcoin needs to bridge gaps of understanding and will expose weaknesses that we can remedy. Viva La Bitcoin!

I can't spell and you can't be loved. I'm ok with that. Sorry to hear about you being so angry I'm sure you have good reason for it. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:56:56
it seams you are a dick. i see no further need for you at this time. Thank for trying to help.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:58:10
Anything less than 20% is a correction and that's usually met by deal takers that force the price up 20% from where it started. Up and up she goes where she stops no one knows I see around $500 early may.

I can do two trades a day easy. The timing depends on the triggers you set to buy and sell so you don't really have to do much. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:55:24
