Thanks so much for your help. I’m a bit clueless so it is appreciated.

Thanks again for your help! I realise it probably feels like you’re trying to explain quantum theory to an ant, but people like you are why bitcoin will succeed!

Right, I see.
So, assuming my bitcoin is showing with a green tick in the ‘History’ tab (which it is) then my transfer IS complete.
I just realised where I may have messed up. I put the full amount of my BTC.com wallet into the ‘Requested Amount’ field and obviously only got paid the amount minus mining fees. Maybe that’s why it’s still pending? If so, is it safe to delete the request in the ‘Receive’ tab?
Man. I wish my bank was as helpful as you have been.

Thinking about it, maybe the request listed in the ‘Receive’ tab doesn’t auto delete?
Am I right in thinking that I could reuse the ‘Receiving address’ to receive another payment if I wanted to? If so, it’s not a bug. It’s just the user (me) being dumb.
Also the ‘Request expires’ setting was set to ‘Never’ which might explain it still sitting in ‘Requests’?
Can anybody with experience of Electrum advise? I don’t think I’m smart enough be trusted with crypto currency.

Hmm. So does that mean I’ve been scammed?

I checked on blockchain.info and it shows as confirmed.
The transaction has a green tick next to it in the ‘History’ tab in Electrum, it shows as confirmed there too when I right click it and ‘view on block explorer’. My balance in Electrum shows the correct amount. However, the status is pending in the ‘Receive’ tab.
Restarting doesn’t change any of the above. Maybe a bug with Electrum?

Ok, so I got an Electrum wallet, transferred my bitcoin to it using the “Accelerated Priority “ option in BTC.com wallet. Now it’s stuck on pending in Electrum. When I check the transaction it shows 11 confirmations.
The mining fee was only 0.00006190 BTC so I guess it’ll never go through? Will it ever make its way back into my BTC.com wallet?
I’m so confused.
