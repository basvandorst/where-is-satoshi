Lol, bitcoin sub and this has this many votes. I doubt the votes are real.

"perhaps you mean the number of people who don't know about bitcoin who decide to learn about it"
Pretty much this. 
I wrongly assumed that your stickers contained a URL. I was going to recommend the use of bitly to track how many people visit the URL.
Disregard what I said before.

Not too sure about this idea; however, many think "There is no such thing as bad publicity." (it's illegal to burn currency in certain countries)
It would definitely cause many media outlets to mention Bitcoin :) 
Edit: The user that deleted their comment suggested to burn fiat in the name of bitcoin

Can someone explain what this entails? 
By my understanding, 51% attacks must be held in order to do damage. Example: GHash maintains a 51% attack for many blocks thus it is the only miner pool receiving coins. 
Is this right?
Is there any way that GHash can implement a system in which they can't go above 50%? or does the randomness mean that is impossible?

Have you ever considered using an identifiable link that can provide analytics to how successful this is? I would like to know what its impact is like. 
It is awesome that you can provide them for free :)

Is that true?
I didn't read much about it but from this, I assume that jail time isn't a guarantee.. Maybe this is just a forgotten propaganda method that we can start up again.
"This is covered in 18 USC 331. It says that whoever fraudulently alters coins is guilty of a crime. The key word there is "fraudulently." If you alter a coin with the intent of defrauding somebody, you're guilty of a crime. If you alter or destroy a coin you own for reasons other than committing fraud, then you're just wasting money.
The origin of this statute goes back to the days when coins were made of precious metals, and their value was proportional to their metal content. In those days, you could shave some of the metal off a bunch of coins and melt it down to get an ingot that you could sell, while still passing the coins off as legal tender. The law exists to deter people from doing that. Today, coins have no intrinsic value so the practice of shaving them for their metal is extinct."

Clever and awesome :) 
One question though, have you ever considered using an identifiable link that can provide analytics to how successful this is? 
I would like to know what its impact is like.

All things I also thought of :) 
I just want us to start thinking in new ways. I found the idea intriguing. 
Someone here may have answers to our questions.

I feel like I am watching important history being formed :,)
This is all so amazing!

Reminded me of this:

Not really, you need to verify it using the internet.

You can't predict the future, don't go all in, first rule of finance.

Maybe some type of zero knowledge private key creation. Idk I just think it is possible. I want to see some opinions. The point of it would be a truly anonymous way to transact in person. Also, to help crypto spread to areas where the internet is not an option.

I agree with this. I would like any ways to transfer physical items that hold digital value. Coins are more durable.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:46:07
I was thinking a meta ledger would be needed too. A way to track rightful ownership. Also, a way to determine only the rightful owner can unlock the funds. It's not very efficient tho. :(
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:22:39
Wow, really cool! Just a little too costly to be viable.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:51:35
Gold works because it is
1) verifiably hard to replicate (cannot be minted by malicious parties)
2) is itself valuable (contained value)
3) instantly transferable (no need for extra steps, send and receive)
How can a physical bitcoin do similar things?
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:48:40
As long as the physical bitcoin is not controlled by a person, I would say it still fits bitcoins purpose. Avoid the third parties.
