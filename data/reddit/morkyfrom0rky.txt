Very confused about Confirmation time and fees.
This morning I went to a bitcoin ATM and purchased $100 worth of bitcoin.  After the 10.1% fee (ouch) I see the amount of bitcoin shown in my wallet as received but listed as Unconfirmed.
I see the estimated blocks until confirmation as 7.  This was 2 hours ago.  
I've purchased bitcoin previously from this same ATM and was confirmed in about 15 minutes.  I only purchased $50 at that time.
I see the fee amount, size, fee rate as follows
0.00006301 BTC, 166 vbytes, 37.96 satoshi / vbyte
I have no idea what this means or how to read it.  I am very concerned that my bitcoins are not yet completely confirmed yet.  Its been 2 hours now, closing in on 3.
Should I be worried?

How much did you have invested in bitcoin before you decided to purchase a hardware wallet?

I'm not going to vote for anyone just because of cryptocurrency.  I am asking of there are any candidates that have spoken in favor of it

Thank you.  I am still very new to this.

I think you would still want to diversify.  Not put all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:11:44
Cash only and remember you will have high fees to consider as well.

I would be happy to do this as soon as I get my 10 million USD from this Nigerian prince I'm helping out.

You keep your private key ( 12 or 24 word phrase ) private.
You can display your address on the side of a building if you want.

The only tip you will get here is not to try mining bitcoin.
