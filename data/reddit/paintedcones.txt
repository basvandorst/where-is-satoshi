maybe, I dunno. I like the ability to tip with bitcoin. it's nice. 
read back your original comment... it does sound pretty "fishing for tips". that's the only reason I gave you shit.

For 1) and 3), why don't you work *with* bitcoin instead of against it? Bitcoin is very clearly a movement... be a part of the movement and work with it instead of against it.
For 2) hahahahahahahaha good luck ever getting people to use different currencies with different exchange rates for different things. fuck that.

Ok I'll bite. Is this something I should use for investing? Buying things?

a lot of people think that commenting on will earn them tips through changetip. your account is 2hrs old and you have no karma, so It seemed pretty likely that you were just a fake account to get free money.

I guess that makes sense... but you're 100% right... they need *value*, not just existence. It seems to me like we'd be better off promoting bitcoin and forgetting about altcoins to get a more mainstream userbase... right?

great article. It also helped me understand this whole "mining" thing a little more.

"I'm only two hours old on reddit and I instantly found a subreddit about Bitcoin, which I previously knew nothing about, that I subscribed to because of a picture" pleasetipmenow

cheers, thanks man

Ah interesting. I hang out with a few people that have told me about their "mining rigs" and stuff, but I've never looked further than traditional media. Thanks for the tip! Gotta find some stuff to buy!

I see the analogy that you're trying to use, but it's shitty. As a new user, I'm not going to jump through a thousand hoops just to avoid a system that isn't *that* bad in the first place. If you think Bitcoin is going to overthrow the US financial system, you're sadly sadly mistaken.

Oh my god *PLEASE* tell me you're trolling.
