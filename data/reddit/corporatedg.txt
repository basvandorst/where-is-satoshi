The funny thing is coinbase makes it very easy to buy things with Bitcoin too. You can hate it all you want but as much as coinbase fucks up that interface is A1
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:12:34
Very true. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:22:34
Bc lets be honest here, there is a ton of irrational exuberance right now
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:53:46
Please, tell us one. Bc I'd love to tell my friends and family about it. You know, those who have no idea what buy and sell limits are
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:24:25
Why wait until a dip? Cash out in the way up by in at times like this
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:01:52
The tide been the same he's just goin with the flow now 
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:35:57
Well coinbase fudges margins and charges fees so take your pick 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:51:49
This couldn't be less true. The reason why so many ppl I know even got into btc was the ease of use of the coinbase app. Having a confusing UI would've kept out the new money we see today. These details are incredibly important 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:01:17
They have no control over network fees. Miners gotta get paid. Transferring money from your bank is free tho 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:06:23
Yes you are right. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:11:06
Robinhood already has a reputation in traditional stocks so it's obviously gonna cause more buzz. Where did you think cobinhood get their name from ? Lol
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:23:19
The app allows you to trade crypto on its platform for no fee 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:12:07
You must not have very many friends 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:01:12
No. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:10:37
Not until you cash out 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:23:11
2 to 3 years is a conservative time span for that in crypto 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:17:05
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:49:28
There are zero exchanges with the usability for the average user as coinbase 
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:32:24
Well I just got approved this morning lol
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:24:40
Lol couldn't even get off the ground 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:32:03
You do know a subpoena doesn't verify fraud, right?
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:11:41
Those things are such a scam 
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:13:05
We gettin investment advice from CNBC now?
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:59:59
And trezor supports a small amount of coins
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:54:11
Lmfao don't spread misinformation like this 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:52:59
Nope. Not as user friendly. Maybe for those familiar with trading but not for ppl who have no background in it 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:51:19
Applied to get on bitstamp 2 months ago now. Still not approved despite giving them everything they wanted. This is why coinbase is number 1
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:36:06
Ledger is backordered until mid March 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:01:04
It's almost like you didn't read what I said as far as why none of those are good options for the AVERAGE person
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:31:34
Y'all love talkin about how much btc is today that someone lost/sold years ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:19:10
You don't know what's ridiculous if it's all you know. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:52:21
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:08:12
Never heard of it, I'll look into it 
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:57:26
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:35:31
Very weird that ppl correlate something possibly revolutionary like bitcoin to a fucking toy. Just shows a lack of knowledge on the subject 
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:35:49
50k isn't far fetched I can see it. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:52:20
The difference is beanie babies never had any value outside of being a toy. Even if you don't like btc now it was the start of a revolution. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:36:20
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:19:39
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:11:04
Why would you follow a random post on Reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:31:14
Lol @ 2 years. Maybe 2 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:17:17
Which is never
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:59:42
There is no safeguard in crypto. If btc crashes everything goes down. Just take some of it out so you can buy back in if there is a drop
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:12:44
The questions ppl ask on here Lmfaoo 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:19:29
Is this serious? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:19:42
Early adopters did not come in at 2013. Mt gox had already made a big splash by then. 2009-2011 were early adopters. I've been hearing finance ppl talk about btc for years 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:35:31
Wait. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:11:52
Yeah he's definitely off there
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:38:20
Was thinkin the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:32:02
Thank you mr. qwerty
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:12:43
You can easily look this up yourself (except xmr)
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:29:31
The drop was severe has me in tears lmfao
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:47:17
Lol at bcash 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:31:11
The first bubble and big crash happened in 2013. This is when finance ppl first caught wind of it as it started gettin media coverage. This is why I said if you got in at 2013 and later you can't be seen as an early adopter. That's all. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:54:57
Lmfao what is the point of this 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:35:06
Let's be honest here...even if we haven't reached the top of the bubble...you have to know this isn't the smart money phase...have you been on these forums lately?
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:56:12
2014 ish
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:22:54
Don't ask just do some arbitrage and win
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:51:49
Surely sounds like it 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:19
There is a delay recently. They'll send you an email eventually 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:56
You clearly don't understand how he even got to this point to even say that
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:52:05
Don't think you understand what bitcoin has started here. This is not just some fling. This is the future. And the twins somehow were able to get in on the ground floor for 2 things that will define a generation 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:56:34
You're in the denial phase
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:24:55
Never said we were. 2 years is a ridiculous thing to say tho
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:35:19
You're giving him far too much credit. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:09:42
The higher limit is on gdax which is owned by cb 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:39:24
There's a case for that I can't lie. But I was asked at the barber shop and at the bar about btc this weekend so it sure seems like the public are aware as well
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:18:15
Man shut up
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:56:49
It will never be zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:13:54
This doesn't really make sense 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:04:05
Excellent point here. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:44:10
Oh I thought he said the opposite. My apologies 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:21:23
All betting sites use btc 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:37
Where were we 2 hours ago? Lol I'm not worried I'm just saying. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:09:46
It's definitely a bubble but that doesn't mean long term it isn't a great investment. Amazon was once supremely overpriced too 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:47:27
It's an all time high so it's a temporary top at the least
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:53
We were at 11k...
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:57:36
Bitcoin segwit is Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:32:48
Never buy at the top. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:00:45
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:28:14
Why is this dumb post upvoted so much lmfao
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:27:42
Hmm I wonder why you called him a drug dealer? ��
