Bitcoin services don't charge high fees like credit card companies. When you see merchants offering discounts of 2-3%, possibly more to pass on the savings of no fee from a credit card company, that will hopefully entice more users into using it.
Also if/when the volatility goes down, more people might be willing to keep their money in BTC, so you won't pay fees as often, to cash out.

Let's not forget you'd still have to convert to whatever foreign currency you're transferring to, and that $8 is the slow option that takes 5 days. Try sending it same day. watch that $8 fee go up 5-10x.

Their settlement from Facebook for doing nothing but sue Zuckerberg worked pretty well too.

It's not free for the 'wealthy'. You have to be constantly putting money in the bank (via direct deposit) or maintaining an average daily balance to get free checking and/or savings at most banks. Sounds free, but the bank is making money off your money, money you could be lending out or investing.. and thus making money.

Screw Chase. They only reason I can see them doing this is because it's harmful to their business model (charging fees).
