I will look into shakepay. I've also heard good things about them. My intention was exactly that. Buy and move to my wallet. Coinberry should at least process the transactions that they confirmed! I'll stay away from them.
Edit: again as I said in my post, they also don't let you withdraw for 72 hours after the first time you fund. So to clarify, I bought, waited 72 hours and then tried to withdraw and they froze my account as I was withdrawing. Yet all the activity within those 72 hours were "normal". Lol seems sketchy to me...
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:47:12
I'm not denying. I looked at the link you posted and used my critical thinking skills to realize it's not worth my time. I know they conducted some research. But it's clear they extrapolated to an exaggerated extent that it's almost laughable. You made so many assumptions about people on this board. It doesn't make you look credible at all. you dont even know me or know the research I have done. And Frankly, I'm beginning to learn you're not worth my time talking to as well.
Edit: look, I appreciate your analogy... It's an attempt to bring perspective. But I already have perspective. Which I think you're lacking. It's like the earth is a sphere, scientists have proven it, some dumb flat earthers are trying to prove there's some edge somewhere..... Lol. And then here you are, trying to say the earth is a triangle.
In fact, how would you feel if I demanded you go out and prove the earth is a triangle. When you haven't even proposed or postulated that concept? That's how I feel about you coming at me with your "facts" then retracting to the point of saying it might be false and demanding I bring up the facts.

Buy buy buy
See... It's that easy to just say whatever you want. stop giving bad advice just because you didn't buy earlier. You can still buy ;)

Okay, you want to have that kind of discussion/debate, sure. I agree, the truth is the truth. I also agree we shouldn't just brush off information that might be true. Especially if it doesn't fit our bias and what we think is true. That way we don't end up stuck in echo Chambers with "tiny brains" as you say.
However, you have now admitted and understand that perhaps "the 19 percent might be a false percentage." That being said, I know there is so much information out there, but I also am not completely naive and will freak out Everytime information comes. Bullish or bearish. Which is why I think you're full of it for backing up one claim... The 19% and you're really sticking to it. Then you have the audacity to call others interested in a similar topic that are having a discussion all emotional fools. What a blanket statement haha. 
Anyway, you said you had 2 words and you gave 4 for the people you apparently have issues with "religious fanatics".... Well as others have said, there aren't even enough users to cover the 19% statistic.... So I'm starting to realize who the true religious fanatics is here. So the burden of proof lies on the people claiming this 19% statistic if anything. So don't come at me talking about "facts" until you yourself have found them yourself.

Yes, I verified their kyc policy when I created the account. Like I said in the post, they do background checks to see if the info you give them matches up with what the credit bureau has on file.
Edit: grammar
Edit2: why am I being downvoted for answering a question honestly? Lol.... Could it be coinberry bots trying to hide this post?
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:19:05
10 days?!?! Wow.... Let this be a warning to all Canadians. By the way, I tried out shakepay like u/MostBoringStan recommended and I was able to fund, buy and withdraw all in less than an hour. I was easily able to create an account and get my info verified. So maybe you should give them a try as well

You try better bud. Maybe it was butchered in your mind? Or at least don't comment... Lol 
Here's another crypto/emininem-rap just for you!: 
I sit back with this pack of these ledgers and this bag, it gives me the shit needed to BE 
The most meaning HODLER on this–on this earth 
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just buy 
And HODL this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it dips to relieve some of the tension 
Because I can't just keep buying with stress
I need some relief so we don't create a bubble
A healthy market–so we stop pretending
That this shit ain't happening
Keep saying I'm butchered the words but guess what
I've made my own lyrics at this point
I'm just spitting out truth at this point
Im tired of all, I don't mean to be mean
Let the king do it's thing, let it be
CAUSE BITCOIN IS WHATEVER YOU SAY IT IS
IF IT WASN'T, THEN WHY WOULD IT SAY IT IS?
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:18:33
Impatient would be the wrong word to use here. I was patient when I waited the 72 hours. Now I'm being calling impatient for having a transaction confirmed and not seeing it for 4-5 days +72 hours?? 
Uh..... I've been meditating to stay stoic about this. So no. Not impatient
Edit: made an account with shakepay. Will only go to them now since they verified me and allowed me to use my own currencies and use it however I want which is what one should expect from an exchange. Security + good service. Not just bad service and then claim it's for security.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:32:12
Hahahahahahahaha if only studies on the world's population could be that easy. Nice try ..... Next time I'm at a concert with thousands of ppl and see everyone jumping, I'll come to the "scientific" conclusion that a certain percentage of the world's population like to a certain song.

@_date: 2019-07-21 14:58:05
This is what I was thinking. Sounds like they are pulling big numbers out of their asses to make themselves relevent. Even their statistics seem off... Like they asked 100 ppl completely ignorant of crypto.

Lol I actually get this.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:57:52
Wow, calm down there. Seems like someone is getting overly emotional now. Again, I'm stoic in my trades. Which I'm surprised you don't understand as an "investor" who knows all the ins and outs of investing. I'm willing to lose whatever I put in Bitcoin. Its not just an investment... And if you know that, you'd be eating your foot right now. 
I'm not an emotional cheerleader. But you clearly are the opposite and extremely biased. You talk about research, facts, news, etc. Yet the only proof you have shown is clearly falsely extrapolated data. Name call all you want. You can think what you want. I just think you're full of it and it's clear to myself and everyone else apparently
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:05:50
Don't worry, bit cones will start to become appreciated for what it is. Some people just like to take their time. Be patient. I agree, educate!
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:30:29
Slow with new customers? Shouldn't the verification process be enough to prove that new customers should get equal service? Or else what's the point of approving and verifying an account?

If we could get 19% of the world's population to work together at this point already.... Wow what a world we would live in. That's how I know this is straight up fud
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:24:00
I made an account with shakepay. They are the same. Free withdrawals and free to fund. crypto fees are minimal. Hardly any wait time. You just have to verify your identity and you're set. I don't work for them... I'm just tired of running into unnecessary issues
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:17:26
Keeping you updated: 
Still no currencies in my wallet. They robbed me... Again, until further notice(they say they take time to "process".... It was a simple transaction that had the most value. Seems scammy as hell even for a trusted business in the Canadian community. Don't trust them if you care about your values and wealth as much as I do.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:26:37
It's an exchange... Why am I not allowed to change my mind about a trade that hasn't even gone through yet? Also, why hold funds already confirmed?
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:30:29
And they also hold your withdrawals hostage (i.e see my post history). I've been waiting days for an exchange to wallet transaction that was confirmed. They are holding my cryptos since last week. As a Canadian, I recommend shakepay like everyone else.
Additionally, they don't even let you attempt to withdraw until 72 hours after you've registered and have had your identity verified.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:15:50
Still nothing. It's been since last week at this point. Never have I ever had a crypto transaction take THAT long. Hours max... Minutes usually. But days???? Come on
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:24:54
Even though Idk if there will be... I don't care because I bought the last dip and at this point, I don't mind just putting a bit of my paycheck every week into this. So a dip to a optimistic realistic level of 8-9k would be nice considering I'm long term hodling. But id be surprised if it got lower than 10k at this point.....

I'm not going to read everything you said.. because based on what I read right off how you start your comment it's clear you're the emotional one here. 
I'm not emotional over this. A lot of people clearly see you're full of it and don't know what you're talking about. It is pretty dumb to see a study that's clearly misleading and try to come out fighting everyone as if you have the truth. Come on. I'm not even phased or have had my jimmies rustled. You on the other hand.....
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:43:28
I'm waiting for it to go under $1 again. I hear penny stocks are where it's at!
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:55:48
That would mean there is less bearish sentiment(any bear moves right now are weak hands) because bulls are not giving up any time soon. So even if there's a dip, it keeps getting bought up. I'd buy more if I could! Take advantage!
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:10:08
I don't think that worked lol
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:59:08
A little nugget? Does that mean there are other nuggets too? =O
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:12:34
Okay I can get on board with that. However, if we zoom out a bit and still look the short term and we go by your logic, it appears a whale sold and multiple sellers followed. Again, I still see this as weak hands. Seeing two dips in a row is scary for most people. Especially since it seems there are a lot of newcomers who bought at over 11k. I'd imagine they are still learning how to rodeo with Bitcoin. I could be wrong.... But it just seems obvious from my brain's pattern recognition and staring at charts for years. 
In other words: don't catch the falling knife!
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:20:32
I think it'll become worthless in the sense of hyper inflation where everything becomes irrelevant. 
However, in your hypothetical and extreme situation, I'd reckon that would be less of a worry. That being said, if we were back trading for food/ being held at gun point, perhaps offline officials would distribute notes. But then we'd live in a shitty totalitarian society and that would suck. Until we create Bitcoin again......
In other words. Don't fuck up the internet. Or go ahead, but internets and bitcoins will come again. It's just one of those steps we will always have to take. Like fire. Anyway, let's not go back in time and find out and just move forward and finally let the kid accept payment in Bitcoin for the lemonade they worked on.
@_date: 2019-10-25 02:31:42
Again I don't think you understand investing that well. Evidence: you talk about a crash from 50k to 8k. If that happened this year, say it went to 50k and dropped back to 8k, you'd still be positive over the year. Nothing you have said is true and there's no reason to believe you. 
You do come off as someone who knows what they are talking about. But as others here have said, looking back at the charts, if you did in fact buy Bitcoin, every year you'd be positive by just hodling/holding. Two years later and it's still at 8k? Sure. Why not. Let's say you're right... But 10 years from now? I doubt it. And it'll be hard for it to just crash back to 8k if it reached 50k. Something big would have to happen. 
Sure you can say it's all relative who wins and loses in the short term.... But long term if you buy consistently, historically, Bitcoin has proved what you are saying wrong. So again, I don't think you understand investing.
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:02:32
That's a lot of words that have almost zero meaning. Time based argument? What?
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:57:58
Yes. Weak hands or people collecting profits. Still, the gradual slow progressive downwards movement in the short term proves we are still bullish and will be for a while. BIG BUY OPPORTUNITY if you ask me
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:50:13
Nobody wants to blame the banks because they are probably paranoid and believe banks will protect their money. So they attack the politics and ignore the banks.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:34:30
I get what you're saying... But how is that relevant? What does that have to do with anything argumentive? I don't think you understand investing. The guy that bought at $1 and the guy that bought at 20k could possibly be the same guy. Bing bong
@_date: 2019-12-15 17:55:25
Yes, exactly. And if you zoom out and despite/including all the data points, you'll see that all time yearly lows have been higher than the previous all time yearly lows. OP was just pointing out the apparent all time low this year to last year's. 
Again, you are speaking trash and have not contributed to the "full story" as op is trying to contribute. You just get annoyed and other people just act like complete assholes for someone making a end of the year analysis.
@_date: 2019-12-15 17:39:02
It is linear if you zoom out and consider Op's time frame. If you used today as a timeframe and included Op's statistic with yearly lows, we would see a linear rise. Every yearly low is higher than the previous yearly low. What I think is trash is how people can't zoom out and look at the bigger picture. OP was just trying to use a reference from last year which history shows roughly. 
Any reference anyone uses is "trash" if you see it that way. In fact, any opinion and analysis would be trash because I can apply the same logic you're using and say your opinion is trash because it is blatantly wrong since we are comparing years and not months here.
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:07:20
You gain self awareness. I for one was curious a few days ago... I thought to myself "hmmm... I remember a year ago the price being somewhere half of this year's all time low. I wonder what the percentage is. Then OP posted this and I am thankful. I don't get why you butthurt people are such assholes for no fucken reason. Must've bought at the all time high and are just mad people are making observations of bitcoins growth. Sad....
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:13:46
Shitposts? Yours' is the shit post I see being upvoted here. A lot of people truly are upset that op posted some yearly statistics... That I for one was curious about. Looking at the year's end and wondering how Bitcoin did a year ago compared to this year's apparent low. Looking at the all time high is actual dumb and again, would make it a shit post. I'm simply amazed by the amount of arrogance of your comment and the ignorance of the people upvoting it.
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:27:35

There are different supports and stages... To me this support is an important one 9500. I think the charts agree because it is staying so flat. I haven't seen it go this tightly sideways for a while. I think any day some thing big will happen. I disagree with months/weeks. Although it would be nice.
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:49:46
Yes, that's why I said depreciating. Meaning it is a wasting asset. But I also understand some need a vehicle to get from A to B. If you want to complete the car for your own personal reason, dont let anyone stop you if you know you won't regret it! 
My point was that if you think moving valuable assets/currencies that might bring more wealth a trade them for something that will waste value, but you see it being worth your time, then totally go for it! All the best my friend. 
Cheers! From Canada :)
Edit: I'm sorry if I misunderstood you and you realized your car is an asset with a good investment. but I'm not sure I see the future the same way. Goodluck!
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:28:32
You do you. All my work mates are buying nice cars and having rev competitions in the parking lot(we are all young with good careers). I'm that one loner that although I want a nice car, I'd much rather wait a few years and see where waiting will take me. So I slowly invest in the future. I have enough energy and patience that I don't mind taking the bus/ride share for now. :) Hasn't made me feel different or envious of other guys and kids still look up to me. Idk, I guess some people just like to express themselves differently. 
In fact, as someone with a background in mechanical engineering that currently works on planes, I'm more impressed by how quiet fast vehicles are getting. Again, you do you man!
Edit: Now that you talk about kids as young as 6. It's awesome how impressed and in awe these younger people are by what us grown ups do. For example.... I happened to have a bicycle pump and the kids on the block needed air. I was basically their hero that day and they all treated me as so. Feels good ��
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:12:15
Lol minor setback. I knew this was coming... Bought at 10,600 (I've but much earlier and with more decent prices... I'm just a holder). 
Don't worry.... We'll get to 11k. No one who has been around really expected that 11k right now. So no, not denied.... Just delayed. If that. Because it'll happen when it needs to. But you go ahead and bash and do all the "victory" laps you want. It'll just make it a slower and more brutal loss in the end.

Also speculating world charts and stocks + currencies ..... If all those hours and sleepless nights have taught me anything is this: BITCOIN IS HERE TO STAY. We will make it whether slowly and painfully like the train that could or everyone just realizes it overnight. No bulltraps. Just bear doubts. If you think like a bear and act like a bear, eventually a bear trap will catch you unless you are lucky. But history always goes towards prosperity.

Why? Still strong support? I would have guessed that it would go way down low but it didn't. Looks like it's about to do something big in the short term if anything.
Edit: some might even just be waiting for it to go lower to just dump in. Also, talks about Carney making a new version of Bitcoin. Which is funny because we already have Bitcoin. I just see this going up as soon as people realize we ARE at the floor.
