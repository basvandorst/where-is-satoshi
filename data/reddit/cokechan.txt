Yes I can, if there's a combination you're interested in, I could test that.

Yeah, I thought I could have potentially replicated it with something like long gold, long Swiss franc, short Chinese yuan or something, but it turns out that it's not enough. It really is pretty unique as an asset class.

By returns he's referring to daily geometric change, or monthly, or whatever time period you're working with rather than using the price. In this instance, correlations should be calculated using the change, not the level.

You're right. I think there are exchanges that offer bitcoin options and futures though, but I imagine the liquidity is extremely thin.

Yeah, we're starting to see signs that bitcoin is responding to macroeconomic surprises now (in addition to geopolitical events). The reaction is still muted, but it's a promising sign for bitcoin investors, I think.

You've got the idea.

Thanks for reading and yeah, I did read that article from Ark. I thought it was well written. 
Really interesting work with the altcoins, it's surprising to me that they're so uncorrelated with the exception of LTC. 
Also, I find the Shanghai Index thing an interesting idea given how much of BTC volume originates from China.

The way I have my code setup, I can't test all those combinations easily, but it's an interesting idea.
