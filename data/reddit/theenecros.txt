Cointap guy here. I would love to go, but I don't know if I can make it until a week from the event.

It's already here!

Not all the energy that goes into a computer becomes heat. Computers use electrons to process data in electrical paths and the resistance of the electrical components create heat. Most of the electrons complete the circuit. Here is a starter page from HP on the topic.

Hey man,
I feel for your loss. I was robbed of 10.2 bitcoins a while back from some jerk posing on Localbitcoins.com
He transferred $7200 into my bank account, then i sent him the bitcoins. The next day the bank froze my account and took the money back out.
Create a bounty and let's catch this jerk!

It's not censored. They never gave Stew the IP.

I would love to come out but the regulatory environment is still pretty rocky. I'll keep in touch.

I went to New York city to a private bitcoin meetup. Speaking there was a professional corporate validator. He had validated Google and Facebook years ago at $100 billion dollar companies. He new bitcoin technology quite well and estimated its impact on financial markets. He said if bitcoin was to capture 1% of remittance markets and Western Union transfers each bitcoin would be worth $1M. He estimated this could happen in about 10 years.

I read the whole thing. I've been doing business for 20 years and it's clear to me Roger created a contract for a term of 5 years for the sum of $10,000 payment per month minimum. A representative from Okcoin signed the agreement and so did Roger. Okcoin is now trying to retract from the agreement by dancing around with a lot of horse shit by double talking, bold face lying, misdirection, stalling tactics, fault blaming and lame threats.
Okcoin are not what they seem and cannot be trusted. If you trade on Okcoin, I recommend that you immediately remove all funds from their accounts and trade on a reputable site like Bitfinex.
Roger, thank you for exposing these lairs. I expect their site should soon disappear along with everyone's funds in another gox explosion. Unfortunately hurting the bitcoin price but thankfully ridding the market of 1 more scamming organization.

My RBC account was closed down due to bitcoin trades.
They shut down my corporate computer business account too.
All other major banks don't want my business.
I have the first company in Canada with Bitcoin in the name.
I did setup an account in a remote credit union. They didnt even know what a bitcoin was. I aim to keep it that way. Note that I don't screw around doing anything risky or fraudy. Everything is legit. Bitcoin is not evil, it's just high risk because of all the scams and fraud going on by some assholes ruining it for the rest of us.

because I've been in the game since 2012. We are going to the moon friend. BTC should be over 20k by the end of the year, minimum.
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:36:55
Thanks for posting. Is this really a double spend? It seems more like a tutorial on how to fix a stalled transaction with 0 fees.

Hey, hold that shit. Welcome to the crypto club where we all do this. When I bought some bitcoin at $130 the price crashed to $60 for 2 weeks. My wife was pissed. I was about to sell it when I thought wait a minute, this is a big move. Let's ride it out and I am glad I did.
Fucking HODL and strap on, we are def going to go higher than $13.3k this bull run.

That's true. Also the internet crushed radio. I have friends in radio that are just surviving by ad revenue by the skin of their teeth. Working in the same job for the past 10 years. Radio is not a growth industry, but the internet? It hasn't stopped growing since it's been born and it grows like a beast still. Bitcoin is a protocol like the internet and has grown like a beast since. You can compare radio to the banking sector, what innovation is there? Banks are dying, going bankrupt, their currency is losing it's value. Banks are not a growth industry either. In 20 years, when blockchains power the financial sector, every stock market runs on tokens and is powered by blockchains, when security is tied to blockchains, people are going to look back and wonder how we kept information, banks and money secure without them.

It's not about putting paypal and eBay out of business.  That is not the point and will never happen. It's about expanding your choices of what you want to sell and who you want to sell to. It's about an open platform. It's about being fair to all parties. It's about being decentralized and unstoppable. It's about the future.

Very cool. I installed it, the dependencies and fooling around with it trying to get it to work! Fun project, I trade with Haasbot normally. Thanks for doing this!

Back in 2013 I had 10,000 in RRSPs that were making me $50 a year. I said fuck this bullshit banking crap, i'll never retire off this. I took it all out, paid a shitload of taxes and yolo bought bitcoins with it. Best investment in my life. No regrets.
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:27:40
Thanks for doing this Coinbase! Hopefully the community gets some sweet apps out of this. I know I am going to submit mine for consideration :)

It's true that it's software at this time, however it is not a software product. Bitcoin is a protocol to send money.
Any software can be burnt into hardware, so one day, when Bitcoin is mature, likely there will be hardware Bitcoin and wallets.

That greedy fuck shorted all his bitcoin and set his fucking buys way below the fibonacci retracement.

I am using this bot and I have to say I am pretty impressed with it's performance. I went from 50 FTC to 990 FTC in one day just allowing it to trade all-in. My fiancee couldn't believe that it was actually working that well and neither could I. Nice work Haas and thanks! It was well worth buying for 0.6 BTC
