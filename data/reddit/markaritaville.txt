not to mention there is still some risk that had he stayed in, the government steps in eventually, shuts down bitcoin and it all goes "poof" and left with nothing.
Bird in the hand...

I am having a problem understanding Coinbase vs a wallet.  I mean, I get that coinbase is where I can buy bit coin, but from there... how do I get it into a mobile wallet?   
I'm waiting on my account to be confirmed and will be jumping in.   would appreciate your assitance

I saw "the shocker".  One in the pink...

Yeah this caught my attention too. Looking at 12 mos price chart, it was 10k about 10 mos ago.  Dropped to 5 for a bit then seems to have settled in the threes.  That doesn’t sound like thriving to me

I bought 3 bitcoin at $400.  I consider it a higher risk investment and while I don't,want to lose $1200, my world is not impacted if it crashed to zero worth.  I wonder if more bitcoin investors fall into similar circumstances... some lower percent of their investment portfolio in bitcoin "just to see".   Which then makes me think... if the tech can be improved and make people feel more secure, does investment increase and price goes up 
Pure theory I just made up.

well thats how it works in commodities markets.  
* Opec increases oil output the price drops.  * 
* US refinery blows up or floods and production drops, price goes up.
Welcome to the big leagues, bitcoin.

meanwhile I recently bought 1/2 a bitcoin on coinbase ($3200) and paid $40
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:51:36
dammit I stopped at .50!  Can't turn back now!
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:34:38
Yes I am aware. Its commentary on several things.. one being how much CoinBase makes to execute a very simple purchase transaction.

Friends who know bitcoin get at me for keeping my coins in coinbase.  But I haven't lost anything....

I said similar to a large holder of BC ( and someone well known on the street) and he jokingly replied.... "you should get a government job"

my mild claustrophobia kicked in watching that

But isnt this the same as every other derivative product?  Buying options on AAPL, you dont own the actual AAPL stock.  Its a multi-billion (trillion?) dollar way of investing.

nice!  The more users, the more the value goes up.  but have they been touting more and more users for 5 years now?  when do we hit a million per?!!!  ha

Arent the Winlevoss twins working on a Bitcoin ETF?   See where that stands... if its close to being a real thing, you could just buy the ETF in your 401k account and pay no penalty fees

The guy who ordered the $13 million pizza ruined it for us all.
I only have a few... but my fear is I'll never be able to sell them knowing they will continue to rise.  Example: if OP takes 12 bitcoin today and buys a nice car for $25k, when the bc price goes to $10,000 will he feel like he actually spent $100k on that car (if he had instead held onto the 12 bc?).  Dont all "spending of bitcoin" become that thought process?
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:41:10
I have 3 bitcoin... bought under $400 each.
Have no desire to use them on purchases.  Just sitting back waiting for the price to go up to a million so that I can retire on my $3 million dollars.
EDIT:  added the "each"
