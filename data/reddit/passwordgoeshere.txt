Does Justin Beiber like Bitcoin or something? I don't get it
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:20:55
What would it be like if Google made their own cryptocoin to pay its workers? Or more realistically, Amazon?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:00
My first thought was uh oh, the price is going to drop. I checked GDAX and it's at 14k... I thought I should totally sell everything but now but Coinbase is unavailable!
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:53:56
That was a very Sarah Palin answer... "Read ALL of them!"
I'm looking for a good source of news, not fake articles and memes. There was a new fork and I didn't even see a post about it here.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:30:49
As a HODLer, seeing everyone acknowledge that there is a huge drop coming really makes me want to sell and buy later.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:59
What are the fees like on Gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:39:42
Coinbase isn't allowing any buying/selling
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:38:05
Is that why the price is so low right now? So we don't have to pay as much taxes? /s
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:45
With hacking in the news, Coinbase is down, how is the price so high?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:54
Oh shit, it's called Gemini because twins own it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:29:19
I'm only mad because trading has been suspended for the past few days and I can't buy more while the price is low.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:54
cant even log in
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:38:00
Anyone else completely blocked from all transactions on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:07:31
Do you mean Tuesday/tomorrow?
I would imagine its a similar answer, it depends on what your exchange is doing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:01
Why Gemini? 
Everyone is talking about a Bcash conspiracy, what if it is actually a Gemini conspiracy?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:49
Nothing wrong with taking some little dividends. That said, I can't bring myself to take money out from this roller coaster
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:37:24
This is what I wanted to do except GDAX is frozen and Gemini can't verify me... Just take my money, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:07
What are the fees like on Gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:09:28
Really tempted to buy some more once it starts to head back up
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:13:25
On reddit you just say /s
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:49:27
Umm, why would they think I'm shady? I've been using Coinbase for six years.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:23:30
What low-fee site should I be using to buy BTC? 
Coinbase has shut off my transactions all week and I'm missing the bargains. GDAX is same, Gemini (edit: Bitstamp) isn't available in my state, WA. Gemini has put me in verification limbo for over a week.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:17
We're sorry, ID Verification is taking longer than expected. Please check back periodically to see if your ID was successfully verified.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:57:33
You might be confused. The fork occurred in August. If you use Coinbase...


@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:55
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:07:30
I'm in Washington State, what low-fee site should I be using to buy BTC? Coinbase has shut off my transactions all week and I'm missing the bargains. GDAX is same, Gemini isn't available in my state
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:00:59
Look at the 1 year scale. It always goes up if you hold for at least a month. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:12:20
how long did it take to verify at Gemini? I've been waiting a long time
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:16:44


Can you explain that more?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:02:27
We're talking about different things. I'm just saying everyone seems to be spreading a doom message about bitcoins value 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:14:24
Why would you pay for gains when you had a loss?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:34:30
Don't throw rocks at me but... Why should I care and what does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:34:07
Maybe that was Bitstamp. Gemini just has me waiting on verification all week.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:53:25
What is this, It's a Wonderful Life?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:09:16
I don't understand this, why couldn't we just keep forking forever to make infinite money?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:22:22
Where do I BUY? 
I've had transactions disabled on Coinbase/GDAX, Gemini since mid December...
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:05:48
If I spend untaxed income (self employed) on bitcoin, bitcoin rises in value, then spend bitcoin on Amazon gift cards, then use those cards with Amazon Fresh to buy food, I have only paid a few small fees and there's nothing to report to the IRS, right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:43:22
But this is like telling people that downvotes on reddit are not for disagreeing with people. We can play by the stated rules if we want or we can do what's allowed to achieve something. If one's goal is making easy money, BTC is a good investment, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:52:59
Ok, "Don't HODL" is that your motto?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:59
Cool, I'm still waiting for verification.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:40:44
You believe it will be 40k but you take your money out when its down? That's a recipe for losing money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:20:09
Ok I'm not sure what your point is 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:00:07
Serious question, is there a good place to get actual bitcoin news?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:34:51
This sub has just as many memes and in-group jargon as What if Wall St has merely planted a bunch of bots saying that we're all going to hold when really no one will hold?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:53:14
what exchange did you use?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:40
How does that happen? I want to get in a 14 and then sell 1 min later when its back at 17
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:35:25
You're golden, if I were you I would just stop looking at the charts for a few days
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:39
What happened to Jan 1? That was the last email they sent
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:37:50
Not available in WA, also wasn't there something shady about it?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:31:40
damn, ive been locked out all week
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:43
Easier said than done. I have had trading suspended on my Coinbase account for the last two days with the message "email us at x", then I get an auto-reply saying "you can no longer email us, use our chat-bot" and then the chat bot says "ok try contacting us here" and links to another chat bot. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:10:40
BTC is down like $200, chill
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:12:23
This is funny but nothing to do with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:37:26
So when people buy bitcoin, the value goes down?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:19:27
I would be buying now
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:43:51
Hey, if I have Coinbase which is crediting BTC holders with Bitcoin2X, is that bad? I haven't seen a clear explanation of this
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:02:24
You'd think it would raise the value of our bitcoins
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:21:43
Wow great sense of humor, everybody!
**edit** context: I was at -5 when I typed this
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:36:58
Yes, the joke is that the headline says "adoption is soaring"
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:23:17
Still waiting to make a profit on LTC, it's only sunk since I bought it because of China bla bla bla.
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:18:26
When is the next correction scheduled for? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:47:42
What has happened recently to cause an increase in value/price?
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:44:33
"Here are lots of complicated ways of saying we don't know what's happening"
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:36:55
I'm continually amazed at friends who think this way. Friends who are brilliant at other fields.
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:51:29
Why are there so many people in Bitcoin subs that seem to be against Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:24:17
Sure, I didn't say you, I said people. Maybe it's sore losers.
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:18:23
Yeah but I don't go to anime subs saying "this is unrealistic and childish" I just do other stuff I like.
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:59:15
Damn, did Wilder get a director credit for that?
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:20:07
You can use bitcoin without gambling?
