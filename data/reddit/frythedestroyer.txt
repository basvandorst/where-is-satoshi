I think everyone might be right this time.
Look at the tech bubble, was it a bubble? Did it pop? Sure.  But many of the companies in that bubble are now worth much more than they were ATH of that bubble.  Some died, but the big players gradually increased in value till they reached new highs.  The slower pace is why no one is saying amazon, apple, or even google is a bubble now.  
The part I would really like to address is the theory that new buyers who just lost a lot of money are turned off forever, I do not believe this is the case.  I’m a gpu miner, nerd, and followed bitcoin since the early early days.  The first bitcoin I bought was through western union to California, took two weeks to go through, and then I lost some of it later with Mt. Grox.  
But what about the new folks?  Buying bitcoin is much easier, but I wouldn’t call it user friendly.  Some of the new buyers had to learn more technical practices than they have ever been exposed to just to acquire some bitcoin and stash it in a wallet correctly. That’s a big learning curve for some folks.  And they did it because they saw people getting rich.
Now that they have those skills, have learned what not to do.  Understand the nomenclature, what’s to prevent that greed from kicking in again on a rally?  What to prevent them from thinking “sure I lost my butt, I bought high and sold low in a panic, but now is the time I make it all back and then some!”
I think we take for granted how much mental effort it took for some non-technical folks to setup a Coinbase account and press buy, as well as understanding bitcoin enough to defend it to their s/o’s, regardless of how simplified their understanding was.
All I’m saying is when people learn to play blackjack, lose their money, but think they understand why.....   they often end up back at the table to try and win it back.

I had no usd in gdax would have had to wait till money transferred in. Was just a momentary laps in sanity followed by a momentary lapse in paying attention.

Decided to buy at 13,8 thought it was the bottom. Didn’t want to wait so paid higher fee to get strait from Coinbase.  Forgot to refresh the screen on Coinbase app, accidentally bought at 15.5.  I’m a dumbass, AMA!  (I always wanted to do an AMA, but nothing exciting including this usually happens) I also own a cat.. AMA!
