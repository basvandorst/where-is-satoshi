You might be surprised. Take a look at how his tweet is doing over at [his biggest fanclub online]( Lot of criticism, and rightly so.

Supposedly the dead man's switch already went off in Oct 2016 when they cut his internet. The story around that is interesting since the switch apparently was rigged to post data to the blockchain. Scan the blocks in this time period for data at your own risk...

Stone was using an earlier tweet from wikileaks or JA (can't remember which) about impending leaks to make a prediction. After the leaks came out people saw that he predicted the leaks ahead of time and assume he conspired, but no communication actually exists. This is what Stone maintains too.
Be careful of predicting things that come true, you too might be colluding and not even know it.
