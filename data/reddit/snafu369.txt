Interesting subject.  Well, JP Morgan has tried to patent digital currency which has so far failed, so I believe.  The US$ as a reserve currency, many pundits have predicted will lose that status.  And most interestingly, the Federal Reserve's 100 year anniversary is on 23.12.13 - a mere few days away.  I wouldn't be surprised if everything financial goes to hell in a handbasket come 23 Dec.  
And who is Satoshi?  Is the fed behind it?  I dunno.  I just hope it's the white hats are the true heroes.  Time will tell.

What if it is the federal reserve who has invented BTC to usher in a new world currency?  After all, Greenspan and others have not disregarded it as such.
China has been asking for a new world currency, after all, they own of the USA's debt in treasury bonds.
'Who is Satoshi?'  That's what I mean....
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:07:37
I hope you are right!  But why is the USA now thinking it MAY be the start of a new world reserve currency.  That is my question.

Well....how old are you?  I am old enough to know that the way one reacts to things in life come back to bite you on the arse.  And I have made many mistakes.  I've been bitten on the arse many times.  I'm no angel.  Evidence?  I can't give any except my word.
You can take it or leave it, or take a few decades to learn for yourself.  Believe me Karma is real.  It doesn't mean if you do something wrong, the next day something bad will happen, it might take a few weeks, a few months, a few years, a few decades...but it WILL catch up with you eventualy.  You can count on that.
That's just the way it works.

That is so COOL!
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:15:56
Great idea though, I would wear one!  We've all got to start somewhere.
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:24:14
I am the antithesist of your typical bit coiner...female, 55, silver-haired...and I hate shopping.   Get out of your mainstream headset....but I get your drift....just don't lump the woman demographic into one basket.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:16:52
Ah, because the US $ IS the reserve currency.
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:30:27
Max is not a troll, he is a genius.  If he does have his own personal agenda, so what?  Everyone will gain from it.  China's downturn is just a momentary blip.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:46:20
Just imagine if that money was yours and someone else took it?  Karma is real.  You did the right thing.  What you did, you will get back many times over.  Believe me on that.
At your age you are also setting a good example to everyone else here.  Code of honour and all that. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:49:20
Don't have any answers for you, but by not taking the coins, you have karma on your side.  Sure as shit.
Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:02:08
Perfectly harmless.  Fire your firewall.
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:30:08
How do you know Satoshi even exists?  I'm thinking Max Keiser among others, are behind BTC.  Apologies if this has been stated already, haven't read the whole thread.
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:53:20
Any links to Gavin Anderson? 
And the Japanese characters for Satoshi Nakamura? (Wouldn't be surprised).
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:13:46
You are welcome.
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:49:39
Pfffftttt...to you...you are talking out of your arse.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:01:01
Oh, excusemoir my fine feathered friend, sorry to have offended you on this lovely night with a full moon in Gemini.
Did you even read it?  I don't think so, given you responded within 1 second of my posting it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:51:41
Would love to help you but I'm in Byron.  Don't worry, it will spread out.
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:00:54
I would not discredit Max.  He's a heavy hitter.  I wouldn't be surprised if he is behind the invention of BTC.  Who knows if Satoshi even exists.  My gut tells me MK and others are behind the creation of BTC.  If MK (if the link is legit), says a big player is entering the BTC market, I would be paying attention.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:04:01
Good comment, we were all noobs once. Offer a hand up. I am no expert, but I learn more everyday I am here. Redditt have some very helpful people.
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:04:14
I do feel for you and I sympathise, however never put any money into anything that you can't afford to lose.  If that's $10 or $10,000 it doesn't matter.  If you can't live without it, then don't do it and you won't be tempted to sell.  Geeze, even $1!  BTC is a seriously volatile currency and no one knows where it will go.  Lick your wounds and move on.  At least you kept a third.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:50:35
If it was me, I would hold.  But trust your gut instinct.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:33:53
I am not a gubbermint troll btw, although I wouldn't expect you to believe that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:49:04
It may have a round-a-about way of ushering in a new world currency.  I'm not saying that is so.  Just throwing it out for intelligent discussion.  There may be many 'white hats' out there in the pentagon and the Fed.  Just saying the world works in 'mysterious' ways sometimes.
To break things down, brings clarity to the surface.  It may be in vain.  Nonetheless, a perfectly good subject to break apart and analyse, I think.
What do you think?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:01:04
When I first looked at BTC it was $130 AUS$, if it gets down to that, I'm buying.  Tanking big time.  Long term, all looks good to me.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:38:31
I'm just interested how many here know about the new world order....anyone willing to fess up?
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:30:46
I would love to know the demographics of users here, (sorry, new to this forum, point me in the right direction).  I'm guessing males 17-30 years, tech savvy, willing to have a gamble, yes?
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:49:34
Ah I geddit, 'lightbulb over head'.  Now I know your age, he he he....and you know mine.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:11:53
Be sensible everyone.  Don't invest in something you can't afford to lose.  The fucking thing is volatile in the extreme.  It can go either way, dicing with death....be careful with that sword of Damocles hanging over your head...it can slice and dice you.  And FFS don't put your house on it, you'd be outta ya mind.  Never mind that your partner may not be partial to what you have done.  MMMMMM...nasty consequences.....THINK before you ACT.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:12:57
Take a chill pill and HOLD!  And don't forget the taxman will want his cut.  Print all your transactions.  It all goes up into the icloud.  They will track you.

Good for you. I only have a little bit, but it's something.

Thank you for a response, am on my iPad so a bit awkward. My interest in Bitcoin is in direct relation to the net which I have seen transform the world from 20 years ago. I see Btc in the same way.  I wish I could write more, but iPad is a very slow vehicle, lol! Btc community can start to realise the older ones have a lot of wisdom of what we have seen before. That is not to say us older ones don't have things to learn from you. It is a two way street eh? Let's learn and grow with each other. We have a lot to learn from each other.
