 Truly people will start to see that money truly is invisible. Given that speculators say each crypto currency will be based off liquidity in the coin, I take it a step further in the demographic consumerism of the coin based off "personal preference". Furthermore, I would like to point out that bitcoin and other crypto currencies all have similar traits to what Aristotle referred to as: ethos, pathos, logos.
 As long as a group of peers can convince using persuasive emotion to similar demographic peers they will then offer logical understanding. With this new profound enlightenment, individuals will then understand that there are opportunities to benefit from digital currencies. Finally, we can not let negative stigmas affect the common goal as peers. The fact that the warning was released cause a flux of selling &amp; I bet the power players are taking advantage of this. Thus, we as a community must understand as something negative portrayed by mass media is associated with bitcoin it is going to surge the price. The fact that we have a reverse affect shows that margin trading is at play, causing to ripple through the network.

What would would be a better idea to this is to allow music to be cryptographed so that consumers can not steal artist content. This needs to be addressed

We should start creating 51% by laws to persecute individual(s) of administering such an attack. We should treat it like counterfeiting money. For a mere fact that "duplicating" coins should never be allowed, similar to printing fake bills. I proposal that this be a universal law amongst all nations/states accepting bitcoin. We as peers have an opportunity to create such a law, and to propel fear into those thinking of committing evil and greed.
