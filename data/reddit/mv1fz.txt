Man I am hodling hard and really hope you are right, but all I am seeing now is shitcoins going full green with 20% gains when btc moves 1%. This never happened before, when btc was going up was a shitcoin holocaust. Seems like they are sucking momentum
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:16:02
Whatever you think... But if we go up at future expiry, expect lots of pitchforks and torches under the CME/CBOE headquarters :P
From my side, I do not think volume is that important, FUD is cheap compared to 80M, and since futures started we got some hell of a FUD ride
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:19:36
not sure if you noticed - one of the key indicators is 'transaction speed'
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:56:26
What is not healthy is eth going to 0.1 and staying there :P
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:29:47
I don't think they will consider LN either, I can already see 'as of now LN is not implemented so we won't include it but might change'...Or something along those lines
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:57:51
It crossed my mind too... but then again, never buy on ATH...
If it grows again I'll be rekt though
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:39:59
Easy to say 'I don't care anymore' when you bought sub-1k :P
I am pretty sure that is not how 19k-ers feel!
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:48:04
...Also not sure why they would invest in bitcoin specifically at this point (they might look for best returns)
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:11:46
So, here is what btc needs to do to destroy your majestic coin:
- increase the block size
Doesn't that make you feel nervous? I would.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:01:00
...Or native windows integration somehow (mail? edge?). That would be even bigger!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:07:59
I think he didn't come out well at all actually, his bias against btc was pretty obvious. The insider trading thing was just the tip of the iceberg - doesn't surprise me BCH fell down after the interview
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:49:31
See the answer from Quartermark above (though I think he somehow swapped BCH with BTC)
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:01:02
People were tackling him quite badly in order to get a statement like 'its just an altcoin', but he refused to say that afaik
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:34:46
Funny how Falkvinge, the 'CEO' of bcash is supposed to be part of the pirate party, inspired by piratebay. Politicians!
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:12:34
As much as I love Gemini, unfortunately it only supports a restricted amount of countries - I guess this is due to regulations. To become coinbase competitors they really need to expand outside US/UK
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:27:14
So, I want to vent out something unpopular, but, well, I hope all is open for discussion and maybe you guys can prove me wrong.
AA often during his speeches said BTC will NOT be the future. He said it will likely be superseeded by something else.&amp;nbsp;
* Maybe this is the reason he did not invest anything into BTC back in the days (ok he says he sold them but... well, you always leave somehting I think)?&amp;nbsp;
* Maybe this is the reason also why he took the majority of donations and transferred them to fiat?&amp;nbsp;
* When BCH came out, he refused to make a statement. Maybe he thought (for a moment) BCH was that future currency?&amp;nbsp;
Please don't take this as trolling, rather something I really like to discuss and hope to get real answers...
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:12
I agree! Was just pointing out the fact that the technical difference is so minimal that I don't get how people can get so hyped about it. I find it ridiculous. LN will wipe bcash out.
[I think you swapped BCH for BTC]

I've been using their credit card since a while now and must say their support is awesome, their card also work great!
Not sure what the fuss is about (experience based on UK cards)
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:52:11
Dude I tell you something... It's easy to blame the newbs because they are terrified. When I made my first buy at 2.5k and it dropped, I was well terrified, of course now that we are at 7k with 4k gains for me (and obviously old timers) its a hell of a lot easier... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:35:29
How can you tell it is not users opening random accounts due to the low credit card transaction limits?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:03:44
Just because you have been there in 2012 doesn't necessarily mean you know whats coming next. Let it sit in your mind. Get that in your head.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:21:45
I've been through the poor stage already, I hope we move straight to rich XD
But yes... Agreed!
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:17:23
1.8Mn is life changing...
I'd move to a country that detaxes bitcoins for a short period (Ukraine?) and use the money to start my own business - a well funded one (~200k) can make you tons more money
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:32:55
Something tells me the war is not over, better be careful!
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:50:50
Btc is  :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:55:47
I have it already and now I am also p**d off that I paid full price XD
I am left with Vitaliks shirts!
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:58:33
I am thinking users could potentially use the 'identity' and cards of all their family, like the grandma credit card
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:06:04
Sorry guys... I take for granted that we all agree CP is not consensual. If any kid you know is kidnapped and molested for this crap, would you want some creep to get off watching their images? You think it is fine that they get off as long as they did not actually molest the child? I call this BS.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:30:50
To be 1k$, Eth would need to have the current btc market cap. I think unless the 'flippening' happens, there is no way they will reach 1k. And I am not even considering new coins mined every day 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:00:00
Yes, its stupid, took me 4 months to get to 2k, I believe you start with 250$
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:52:23
one of the shops:
Black Friday Giveaway: Win one of Vitaliks T-shirts!"
...Seriously, how can you complain that I am hodling? :(
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:47:27
This is the way to go though... Outrun conversion!
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:12:54
Are we sure this was him telling to someone and not an exchange leaking data? :/ 
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:02:08
NO!! I am definitely not mocking the community here and I have part of my savings in BC, which is what is annoying me about all this. You see, as long as we have a strong community (and we somehow still do, I believe), this kind of workarounds or patchworks (send some satoshis to this address, stop transactions... blah blah) might work... But what will happen when the users will no longer be a community? Is it really something the community should solve? What is the core team going to do to prevent being duped again in the future? Sorry, I am a bit triggered by all this nonsense...
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:08:27
As a personal opinion, these posts make me feel I am not alone enduring the pain, its good for my hodler mental health
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:26:37
Well, that would make sense if you live in US, if you don't, buying stocks outside your country is not so easy unfortunately... Not that it would have made any difference in the end
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:40:12
This stuff reminds me of old IRC times - the SW2x guys have taken over BC. Regardless of the outcome, I hope BC will take actions to prevent this kind of hijacks in the future (I really think after all this is a vulnerability of the system). Unfortunately, Coinbase is taking months to deliver BCash, so I'd be surprised if in one month they manage to offer two chains on their site
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:12:22
See my comment to StopAndDecrypt... Users are able to decide as long as they are a tech savvy community as we are at the moment. I came on reddit, I read everyones opinions and I've made my decision. But do you expect in the future people to keep constantly up to date like this? A worker that wakes up at 5am, comes back at 7pm and starts reading the forums? Bitcoin is a brand right now and should have been protected better I think
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:05:17
Sadly, that doesn't make the Discovery series any better :P
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:36:17
Where are you going with this? I just gave an answer to leakim1991... Not trying to teach anything to anyone
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:25:29
Told my dad how much bitcoin was doing great and he got interested - he went to his bank and asked for a bitcoin. They asked him for the nasdaq tick name...
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:39:51
Haven't seen Orville yet, looking forward to it!
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:39:19
Great idea! So what is going to happen when BC gets to mass adoption? Phone up people one by one at home and tell them to not go for the bad fork? How about once exchanges become decentralized?
I really hope that a solution will be proposed soon to these issues as well
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:21:15
That is not the point... Mentally, I still feel sad when I lose 0.5%. Rationally speaking, you are completely right, makes no sense

I see what he has done there... He is using the basic trendline that BTC was using until March. According to that BTC is now worth 1500$ roughly (everything on top is a 'bubble'). Very conservative but possible imho
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:53:36

Meh, I can take a retarded but he is offensive for no reason and not against me...
