Man... I just moved from The Hague in november, lived around the corner from that street (seriously, like 200 meters) and now they pull this!?
Seriously though, this is really cool. It used to be a run-down part, and the bars and cafés really pulled together over the last years (maybe 5 or so) to make it one of the coolest streets in the city. They called it ["Avenue Culinaire"]( and the organise all kinds of cool stuff, working together with all the entrepeneurs in the street, but also the schools nearby as well as the municipality. And now Bitcoins apparently!
A note on the picture shown - this is "Jazz in de Gracht" (Jazz in the canal). They get jazz bands, put 'em on some barges and everyone stays put by the sides of the canals, beer or wine in hand and they move around every 30 min (the barges with the bands). Its great.

It's about gaining acceptance. Stick to things people know, it's difficult enough. If people on this sub already start twitching and blinking nervously when hearing the term, imagine what the "real world" will do when you spring this stuff on 'em.

They can also be viewed as aiding in illegal activities. I think it's a two-part question:
- Can the transactions be seen as aiding illegal activities?
- Will prosecution for these transactions likely follow?
For banks it's probably a yes-no, for BTC, it's debatable! Maybe it's a yes - but prosecution won't (can't) follow.

Oh.. I get it. I think she means person-to-person payment. That's what they use in (some) financial circles to indicate that it is a way to pay someone else through a third party. I know it's kind of the opposite from peer-to-peer. 
And I think our perspectives are the same. "Trashing what we have now" is an extreme way to put it. Nevertheless, if there is a better method to replace "what we have now" - trashing the old would be the best way to go. It feels un-intuitive but is the most rational way to go. 
So the funny thing is - it's a double fallacy: she makes it sound like using bitcoin means trashing everything else (fallacy  This sounds very bad already, but if you look at sunk costs, it would in fact be the rational way to go. In other words - why spend more on an obsolete system? The effort and money you put in it in the past don't justify putting future money and effort in this less-than-optimal system. So there's fallacy

Speculation is useful for media attention, gaining momentum and eventually, hopefully stability. Everything that helps gaining acceptance is ok for me in this stage. Utility will have to be the main driving factor eventually. Ideology is not a good factor to gain mass acceptance I think. 
It's like vegetarianism (is that a word?). Here in Holland, it's become quite normal to not eat meat for a few days per week. I think that sort of gradually happened over the last few years. Most of the people I know aren't ideologists, the just think it's "probably better" and don't mind the savings, and got tired of crap meat in the supermarkets and have some awesome recipes that don't require meat, and basically just grew into it.
I would love to see a similar growth with Bitcoin - ideology first, then just cattle-like acceptance later.
Regarding the hot potato - I feel I've picked it up in april 2013, and have been holding on to it ever since, knowing damn well what risks I'm taking. If the BTC dies out in the same way, with people who knowingly take risks by investing in a "dying" currency in the hope of it reviving, it feels like a fair deal to me. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:46:12
Good question. Best answer is already given I think (gaining acceptance).
The underlying question is - what practical benefit is there for the consumer? It's not really that big of a deal to be honest.
Real benefit would be if the savings of the transfer not going through paypal or cc-companies should be shared with the customer. This would really get the ball rolling and open up the door for the more larger and grand-scheme-of-things-benefits like freedom of oppression from the man! Yeah! Say it with me now...
Anyway - there's a lot of ground in between to cover is what i'm saying.

I lent out .6 btc in oktober somewhere, at least right before the bubble. Just to try it. Received .63 back during the bubble. I was amazed it worked and vowed to never do it again. I was following some borrowers at the time though, who i thought were the safest bets on the site - all 5 of them turned out to be scammers in the following months.
The trick is to: 
be reliable for a certain period of time, build up credit and faith with the community, and then leave with a big bang in the end.
Or - have good intentions byild up credit, be successfull, screw up somewhere and realize you have huge debt with insane interests and bail out. BTCjam or any arbitration can't do shit about this.

Are you talking about me? Because I definitely care how the current system works, and I'm not on the bottom of it by far! (I mean,  think everyone who's reading this on his own laptop is doing just fine in worldwide standards). I find it quite hard to explain this ideology to the outside world though.
Or are you saying that most people are just happy to catch an early ride on the btc train with the idea of getting rich within a year? In that case - yeah sure I agree, but what are you gonna do about it? These people are the main driving factor for btc recognition so I'll take it as a necessary evil. Same goes for the speculation. I'd rather have a solid buildup of acceptance based on actual increasing functionality of the protocol, but that's just not the way the world works I guess.
In any case, you gotta admit it's pretty silly to keep repeating yourself for a year.. ;)

I think these close aroun 02:00 like most cafés in The Hague (on Friday and Saturday that is.) THere's only so many places to go after that, so usually people resort to the Danzig, The Pijpenla, the Feest van Sinterklaas or the Maliehuisje, although I think that last one changed names or owners at some point in time.

They should, of course, for obvious practical reasons! I currently can't think of a better method to spend cross-border money. Although I have say I do like SEPA, but that's quite limited.
It will however raise more awareness to an issue that Airbnb is already currently facing: [it's not regulated]( (the homes I mean). In NY it's a big issue I believe - houses don't have to follow the same rules and regulations that Hotels do. 
Now I don't want to get into this debate because there are too many sides to discuss, bu the point is that if the payment is also "unregulated" it will become an even bigger issue for Airbnb. It's something they will definately have to think about.
But otherwise - I can only think of upsides - it would save a huge amount of money on transfers!

You know, he's probably a very smart dude, but he should know better than to have such a huge opinion on something he really didn't look into so much. I don't think there's a financial system in the world today with more clarity than bitcoin! How much clearer does he need it?
Honestly, I think it's generation thing. All these JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, FED and all other 50+ aged elitist geezers running the show used to be just plain evil. Now their too old to understand these types of changes. Too rigid for these types of paradigm shifts. They wasted all the inquisitive energy they had left in their bodies and minds trying to catch up with generation y who are filling the ranks of their companies. Now they have nothing left. They can't grip the idea of bitcoin because it's just too damn difficult. Their souls are too tired. And rather than face that fact, they keep turning too their other highly respected and equally old and tired elitist colleagues and confirm that their ideas are still the best.
Well they're not. And you will find out soon. Give it a year or maybe two, if you have the energy...

There are (almost) 2^256 private keys. Thats's 1.1579209e+77 according to google.
Imagine everyone in the world, let's round it off to 7 billion people, has a billion dollars. And each of those dollars is in its own wallet. That would mean there are 7 billion times a billion wallets containing one dollar worth of btc's.... (It's quite hypothetical I know - go with me).
That's alot of wallets.
Now image all those wallets in your hand, virtually. In fact, place your fingers about a millimeter apart, and image all those billions and billions of filled wallets in between your fingers! (do it - seriously)
Now the amount of possible private keys remaining... Is still 2^256 (rounded off to the quadzillionth decimal or something.)
So If the "full wallets" fit in between your fingers, the "empty wallets" wouldn't even fit in the observable universe. In fact they wouldn't even fit in a billion observable universes... In fact, they would only fit in 2.6607597e+56 observable universes! In fact, the amount of comparisons I have to do to put this number in perspective would take more time than has existed since the beginning of the big bang!
Ok that last one is not true, but you get the point: **tl;dr** It's possible, but probably too much work...
not 100% sure on the math there, I might have a step somewhere, feel free to correct me.

He doesn't understand it, which is not a problem itself but it's because he hasn't taken even an hour to look into the subject. That in itself wouldn't even be a problem but he uses his platform to make statements to the world which are clearly unbacked. That's why I dismiss him.
Furtermore, he teaches his students the same shit! Everything after that is, admittedly, generalisation. Still true though. 
It just pisses me off to see guys like this take the stage and not know shit. And people will just believe it because he has "triple the lifetime experience". The JP Morgan guy on the front page for example - the stuff he claims about bitcoin is just plain ridiculous! It's so obvious he didn't look into it AT ALL, yet here he is as the CEO of one of the most influencial companies in the world, in the NY Times or Forbes or whatever huge magazine, talking out of his ass! And people will believe it, because he is old and rich and must doing something right...

The first argument you mention is based on her assumption that bitcoin, once mainstream, is regulated and bundled in a service package. (I don't know - eg Bitpay for the transaction and conversion, some wallet-service that pays and insures your wallet or something, i'm winging it here - plus some regulation and a tax-paid arbitration service or something). It's a pretty huge assumption, and maybe not even a strange one to make. However - she's missing the point that all these services would be constrained to **true** market forces where the best quality for money will survive.
That last one is extreme but I would label it "sunk costs". Trashing what you have now is better than keeping it and wasting more money. In a nutshell.

According to some posts I found on this sub from about 8 months ago, they took the btc option down after the coverage from Bloomberg sparked some questions about legal issues. The travellers' box organisation was looking into solving these issues, but apparently they haven't succeeded yet. 
Gave my money to Unicef instead.
For those interested, it took me some time to locate the thing. It's placed behind customs, in the area around gate 221. [Map of the airport]( At least I'm pretty sure it was there, was kind of sleep-deprived at the time...

With Kraken it took about 10 days to get Tier 3 verified. Sometimes it takes longer. Once you're in though, service is great and the UI is awesome.
You might want to give them a try since they bank at Fidor in Germany. Perhaps that means you can use your payment processor? (I'm not familiar with it but it sounds German;)) 
Otherwise, a SEPA transfer usually takes 2 working days for me. (Last one I transferred Friday afternoon, and deposit in my account was monday afternoon)

I think it could be. It would be unreasonable, but it could be seen that way. Think about Google having to actively block all the search results for the Max Mosley dude. Completely unreasonable, but following a certain (flawed) logic still the verdict of at least two seperate courts in two different countries.
Think about torrents - the Pirate Bay hosts no illegal content, only links to others doing the same. I think the only reason the hosts are not being persecuted (I mean all torrenters) is because it's practically impossible.

Even though I'm a btc enthousiast, I agree. The systems that are in place in the curent financial system are there to solve real financial problems. The btc community will face many of the same problems and will also find there are many very good systems in place already in the "normal" economy. Furthermore, any cryptocurrency will encounter many more previously not encountered problems it will need to solve.
The point where I get optimistic is the way that the community, or maybe more the mechanism of free markets, solves these issues. Sometimes ruthlessly, and maybe fataly for btc (we'll have to wait and see how this current dip turns out). The system that remains will be more and more stable each time.
And if not, we'll get a new crptocurrency that deals with earlier problems much better than bitcoin does now. It will have to be before I put money in it anyway.

The whole point is decentralisation. Banks already issue internal coins faster atm. I can transfer money to a friend with a different bank, via mobile, with a few second delay. (In Holland anyway). The reason they don't do it everywhere it not a technical one but a financial one. All the cash "in transaction" is worth a huge amount of money.
It's not a technical need - it's a need to be in control of your own money. And don't even get me started on the whole fractional reserve issue! ;)

It depends on what you are after! For me - mainstream adoption of bitcoin would be awesome. So news is good, but good news is better! It all works together to get the "shadyness" away from btc.
On the other hand - if everyone is telling you to buy, you are probably too late. This goes for stocks in general. I'm not sure it's applicable to bitcoin yet, I think we have a long way to go. So that could be a bad sign - if you haven't invested yet! ;)

You must be new here. I've seen bitcoin go down from December 2013 al the way to the end of 2015. That's a long time to be holding. Of course it must all look easy at this point, but if you are actually seeing investments of thousands of euro's being decimated, it takes a big man/woman to stay optimistic..

@_date: 2017-01-07 09:50:17
Well I guess we agree then. 
Not being pedantic, there will come a time when comuters stop functioning as they do now. Quantum computing has been discussed many times here and it (or an alternative) is an inevitability. Some coimputing system that  will break cryptography as a whole as we know it, and bitcoin will be just an unsafe collectors item at that point. So maybe not in 10 or 20 years, but what about 50 or a 100 years? What about 2140? Do you think cryptography will survive until then?

@_date: 2017-01-07 10:39:16
So I decided to read up a bit. Much has changed since I was really involved 2 or 3 years ago. Apparantly a soft fork to different adress types is all it would require to secure new adresses against qc threats. 
So I guess we'll just have to wait until computers stop existing for the bitcoin to reach 0. Of course there is no way to know at that point what the price is, but still. ;)

Which current network methods are you talking about? I am talking about a bitcoin adress, not a network (IP) adress. With sufficiently powerful QC, a private adress can be obtained from a public adress. Currently, the most advanced QC is able to factor the number 21 -[ it is able to figure out that 3 * 7 equals 21.](
QC is something that will take decades to achieve, I'm not sure your question is really relevant. I think all protocols will be surpassed at that time anyway.

This post and all that led to it is an exemplary symptom of what is wrong with the bitcoin community today.
I keep repeating it, but I miss the "Let's make all the problems in the world go away" attitude. Power to the people, bank the unbankable, science not political power and what not. 
Now it's just a bunch of non-contributing dicks pointing fingers at each other. Can someone please tell me where the awesome discussions are being held? Because it sure as shit isn't here.

The last Lynch mob that went after mtgox did result in other exchanges (at the time, but also afterwards) getting their act together. Im not saying to actually grab pitchforks, but it really helps the community to look at what happens during these peaks and use them to improve.

@_date: 2017-01-05 13:10:33
Well as you have probably seen the price is skyrocketing (and going down as we speak btw). This is due to high levels of trading and buying in China. (price rises when demand is increasing more than supply).
My assesment is that these are not new-found bitcoin enthusiasts, but speculators. I dont think they are buying to hold long term, but to sell at a profit, and preferably sooner than later of course.
That doesn't mean it's a bubble though, there is still intrinsic value in a bitcoin. A bitcoin can now be bought or sold for just under a $1000,- Who is to say why people buy it? Because of possible speculative gains or because of belief in the future of the product? It's probably both, but no-one can say for sure how much of which.
So to answer your question - I think it's a solid product with an inflated price, some of that price will pop like a bubble, and some part will remain solid all the way to the moon.
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:21:45
No, quantum computing is something that will actually exist within our lifetimes. If you read my other comments in this thread it is something that actually requires serious though, although mitigating measures are already conceptualized.
This issue has a very detailed entry on the bitcoin wiki, but I guess nobody bothers with bitcoin anymore, just the price. So just keep downvoting any serious discussion you come across and keep posting fucking moon- and rollercoaster memes, because that's all this sub is doing nowadays.
@_date: 2017-01-07 13:17:10
I did, if you do your research (it's right there in your fucking face) you'll see I have very reasonably researched the matter further and concluded quantum computing is still an issue to worry about but not as much as I stated.
Thank you for a good discussion, I enjoyed it very much.

Agree. The mtgox story wont fit with main stream media reporting. It has to be higher than any earlier reported price.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:22:22
Oh, about that catching a falling knife: I've found (I am not a professional trader) that it's do-able to trade on eg Kraken and make some profits. I took some days off and managed to probably make a few percent a day. While that sounds nice, you have to realise that if you want to make, say $50,- you have to be pushing around at least $1000,- for that amount, and that's if you're really good. The downside is that if there is a huge spike, you are most likely caught with your pants down, having just sold and waiting for the price to come back down. So while you play around with a few procent, you are very likely to miss any huge runs bitcoin is (in)famous for. Just like this last one for example.
So for me - I'm holding out, I rode this last wave up, and now down. I am not drunk, but I am in it for the long run - definately.

The mtgox inflation was limited to the btc's on mtgox only. So the values mentioned are about right. 896 vs 880/870. You could also argue that that entire 2013 run was due to mtgox inflation, in which case its anyone's guess what the value would have been.

There's nothing principally wrong with the blockchain wallet, but there have been numerous cases of 'hacked' wallets that basically all were possible because of the fact it's online.

You're not an idiot. Exchange markets are just places where people buy and sell each other bitcoins. It's so simple you easily miss it, it also happened to me.

I think bitcoins are a great medium to learn all this stockmarket stuff, and in that sense already a great investment. So fuck it, keep learning, have fun, and have a mBTC!

I have some old written journals from the eighties. They stay legible really well. Even pencil is fine. The old printers (matrix at the time) are really vague, I'm not sure what the laser and inkjetprinters will do in 20 or so years, but i would write the keys in old-fashioned ballpoint as well. 
As to the value - i'm pretty bullish on the bitcoin for the long term (i mean that im optimistic about its value), but i do think that something will surpass it at some point. I also think that point will come much earlier than 20 years. You should consider the possibility the value increases tremendously and decreases to zero again in this timespan. The btc as a store of value is debatable to say the least.

I think the problem is that these types of people **do** actually look further than their nose. It wouldn't be sufficient to just make a huge amount of money on some coins (let's be real - they really don't need that). They're looking for permanent power -  a position which will ensure their 1% status for many generations to come. That's where a coinvalidation sort of scheme would come in - owning the main organisation that decides if your coins are valid or not could mean a hugely powerful position when btc's take off.

you need to import the wallet using the private key if you want to use it on blockchain.info

Sure, but they still represent over 21000 restaurants!

Obviously racism has nothing to do with it. I would never deal with any Nigerian company either, but that doesn't make me a racist. I'm not saying Bolivia is like Nigeria, but it's a sliding scale of corruption, where I assume it is easier to get away with fraud as a company than in non-corrupted countries.
When sending out your Bitcoins, caution should be used in any case. I use the "suspect until proven trustworthy" before even attempting any sort of transfer. 
Companies that are based in countries with a higher corruption rate than my own are especially suspect. Not racist, just corruption statistics. Check it here:
Bolivia is about halfway on the list of least (or most, however you look at it) corrupted countries. It doesn't disprove your honesty, but hey, these are bitcoins we're talking about, you can't be to safe.

To be honest, most people are careless about security. That doesn't mean  Bitcoin is faulted in any way, but it does mean there is a big market for businesses who will perform the securing part of the bitcoin currency. Please keep my bitcoins secure and make sure I can be a general consumer idiot without having to think about things.  This is what's needed for bitcoin to go mainstream.
I know people will freak out when I say this because fuck banks and all that, but personally I don't have an issue with the core business of banks, at least the way I see it, which is - protecting your valuable shit. It's the part where they start fucking with my valuable shit like putting m money in toxic mortgages and what not that I am not a big fan of...

Well loads of purposes. For one, my hypothetical store wouldn't sell half as much stuff it does now (hypothetically) if people started hoarding their money. If people spend their money in my store, I will spend it somewhere else.
In other words - people use my service and in return I can use other people's service. Better than sitting inside hoping I willl have more to spend tomorrow?

All I see is Jackie Chan and some Bitcoins... Which is the most awesome thing I have seen so far on this sub!

Easiest way would probably be to obtain at least 51% of the total network power and then resend.

Why would anyone downvote the tipbot??

You know, he's 11. I think, if he figures out how to actually use it to buy something he wants, he's pretty much ahead of 99.9% of the population anyway!

Yeay, so you're saying delfation and inflation are natural phenomena that occur on either side of a balanced eco(nomical)system?

This is so awesome... For people who don't know this site, it's the biggest online food delivery site in the Netherlands. Fot BTC in NL, I think this is one of the biggest breaks so far!
Currently only NL uses the Bitcoin, but it seems likely that if succesfull, other countries will follow.
