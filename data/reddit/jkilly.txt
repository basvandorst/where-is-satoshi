any kind of centralization is going to invite misuse of power/authority for the benefit for the few members in power. when you can get away without playing by fair rules, someone's going to do it.

Sums up my thoughts exactly. You should always explain to people that bitcoin is not a finished product when introducing it to them.

nice project 
but couldn't we just visit blockchain.info from our phones? 
@_date: 2014-05-17 11:04:52
Such a shame their gov is soooo freaking greedy and corrupt.  I feel so bad for all the people there that have to live under these tyrant criminals.  At least we keep ours in check by pretending to vote them in...
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:09:22
Sounds great!
For sure anonymity has much more opportunities for people to live better than for criminals for doing bad things. But all governments only see the second one.

so any news from south africa? do you guys have any BTC ATMs in south africa?
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:40:44
Google is an internet GIANT. This further legitimizes and mainstreams bitcoin. Although I'm surprised yahoo finance beat google to adding charts for bitcoin. Once other altcoins like LTC gets big enough, I'm sure they'll follow suit.

Armory is not newbie-friendly, and neither is Bitcoin Core (Qt). I recommend Mycelium for Android, Electrum for PC/Mac/Linux, and Blockchain.info for IOS. 
Blockchain.info has the advantage of the ability to access the same wallet from different devices, but has the disadvantage of needing the site to be available in order to use it.
Don't use a site that doesn't give you full control of the private keys (e.g. Coinbase and any of the exchanges).

I wonder if ATM is the best way to spread the use of cryptos. I think atm on smart phone will be the winning solution.

Invest in altcoins. Watch the market for a couple of months then take the plunge.

Patrick Murck, General Counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation, announced the 2014 Conference in his November 18th, 2013 written testimony to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Should we upvote or downvote him?

September 4, 2013
1 BTC = $123
September 4, 2014
1 BTC = $475
That's an increase of $352 (286%) over 1 year.
It'll be interesting to see what happens in the remaining 4 months.

Well he's not really accepting bitcoins is he? He's accepting cash, and letting you give him cash via BitPay.

It's maybe weakness but I don't think they'll not convict them.

I hear of some rumors that Facebook is going to accept BTC in the near future Smiley Am i late with this news, or just misunderstand ?
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:25:08
Bit coin does not need permission. As another poster pointed out much more eloquently than I could there are all ready regulations in place for currency. If your activities involve both fiat and crypto then you can use the current framework.

I'm too scared to even touch my life-savings. Bitcoins could rise or deflate at any time. It's too risky for anyone to even touch (my opinion). Maybe if I was hella rich, I would invest like 50% of it. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:47:27
Ebay is a relic from the dark ages, decentralized marketplaces are the future for trading. 
Couldn't care less if they begin accepting btc payments, think it's too little too late.
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:55:04
The idea is logical but i think it will go against the whole ideology of bitcoin on self management and reliability on a third party.

I don't think I would record the entire seed in plain text on paper anywhere.  Maybe write down questions that only you and those you trust (heirs) would know the anwsers to, which would make up the seed.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:23:00
Oh c'mon it's a fucking dictatorship. No bitcoin stuff is gonna be established. They will get 100% unanonymous and government controlled payment system instead.

BTC itself is a central bank, owned by the people. at least until some dude hoard all the money, again.

Clueless capitalism apologists spotted congregating in this thread. Avoid eye contact, they have a propensity for violence when it comes to enforcing profit.

Wish 0 confirmations are enought at more places, most places require confirmations, but they offer no service that cannot be canceled later (like before the goods are really send). It would be only bit more work to cancel the order if not paid later for them and zero risk...
I understand confirmation is really necessary for instant services only

Bitcoin market price would almost never go down in any significant manner if an ETF is launched dealing with bitcoin﻿
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:15:05
Great concept but I find it hard to use all these coins for prediction markets or whatever proposed they are so illiquid. Developed on top of bitcoin to use bitcoins liquidity has greater chances of success imo.
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:48:58
So you mean we just take our chances, right? That's what I think now.
