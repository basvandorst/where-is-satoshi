My account was frozen due to a few hundred dollar transfers between a friend, for a deposit on my condo which he took over the lease and was paying me back. I had to send venmo my bank account statements, verify my identity, all the while they would not give me a clue why they were asking for the information. Was a pain in the ass and I couldn't get my funds unless I did it, and again I had no clue why.

So click on bitcoin when you pull up your payment options, and then click wallet and it will ask for you to verify your identity before transferring to another wallet

Litecoin just received Segwit less than a month ago and is still in the process of creating their Lightning Network to full scale, which is the part of the software that makes it revolutionary for transactions. At the moment, Bitcoin takes days to confirm and has very high fees. When lightning network is fully implemented, it will take minutes to confirm and the fees are minuscule. 
Companies are already adopting litecoin, in China there are litecoin ATMs. 
Litecoin is at the stage where the technology is there and is still being implemented fully, it is just still growing to the commercial recognition stage. In my opinion, it is more than worthy for any cryptomaniacs investment portfolio. 
Here is my current view of the three main coinbase currencies:
Bitcoin: Store of value
Ethereum: Good for businesses due to blockchain protocol, higher fees than Litecoin
Litecoin: Good for general commercial public and daily spending, quick transactions and low fees. Can also do everything that Ethereum can for cheaper.

No knowledge on this side of Bitcoin you are talking about, not a huge Bitcoin fanatic.
Could you elaborate further on the backlog issues so I can better understand?
