Basically what internet trolls with no honor do. Close our ears and pretend to not hear you till the last second. Then when bitcoin crashes just vanish.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:16:15
Best post here.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:38:16
Terrible analogy is terrible.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:12:26
Reflection of a bigger problem with bitcoins, no regulation. I predict many Mt Gox's in the future. It's human nature.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:31:48
yea you mad  you lost your buttcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:25:39
If any of you actually believe the "well thank you for selling this is an excellent time to buy =)" trolls then you deserve to lose your money.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:10:00
Don't call it a grave; it's the future you chose.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:56:27
Actually it's terrible. The internet is not a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:52:10
As a guy who never invested a cent just watching the train crash, the reason bitcoin is failing is because of all these people treating it like a tradeable commodity and not a currency which is most adopters. That's why I enjoy watching this burn.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:37:55
Fails. Collapses. Loses all value. Becomes a laughing stock of the world (more than it is already).
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:25:05
Answer the question.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:16:01
How did you find out?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:37:02
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:04:12
Doesn't matter Bitcoin is nothing without your unregulated exchanges who are free to rip you off as much as they want.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:42:37
Nope none. You wanted an unregulated system you got it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:31:18
Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme destined to fail.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:13:03
who and how do we know you aren't lying?
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:38:25
Why would anyone take bitcoin seriously with these constant dramatic jumps?
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:25:01
Oh wow it's 100% up and running.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:12:21
The problem is your justification can be used to justify a ponzi scheme which as we all know is what bitcoins are.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:30:35
lol u mad bro?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:17:32
it's dead Jim.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:35:55
Fake fake fakedy fake.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:37:27


I'll answer that when you answer my question first.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:10:28
Somewhere out there is a fedora store waiting for you to come in and buy a fedora so you can tip me with it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:49:18
I mean regarding bitcoins in general.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:41:08
WTF what? Did you not see what happened today? Your money was run away with. Classic pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:57:46
God you guys are like living stereotypes.....
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:07:11
I'll hold you to this.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:47:38
