The page source for their website while it was "blank" had a comment that said something along the lines of &lt;!--- add information about acq --&gt; until they updated it recently. It came straight from the horses mouth.

I'm not sure if it's the unsourced comment you're referring too, but you can find other people referencing it here: 
For what it's worth; I find it incredibly hard to believe MtGox got down to 2000 BTC in their hot wallet only...

Yes not in this image you're right. But this is only a few days worth, which was the point I was trying to make. Long term, it would show up.

The chance of a fortuitous collision is still extremely low

It would be noticable in the long run. You can kind of see it in that image, as you sum n identical independant random variable, you end up approximating a normal distrubtion, centered around n*mean (Central Limit Theorem). As n gets larger, this becomes a better and better approximation. The rate at which it converges depends on the RVs distribution, this case is a fast converger.
If you did this for a day or two? Sure, no one would ever know. But if you consistentaly did it, the stats would show your meddeling.

The problem I see with this is that it doesn't make it easy enough to have unique passwords for every site. It doesn't matter how much entropy your password has if you use it everywhere. It only takes one site to leak your password and email and you can lose all of your accounts. That was part of the issue with mybitcoin wallets.
Something like keepass or lastpass (if you can trust them) is better in my opinion. Sure, if your computer is compromised by malware it may steal your passwords, but if that happens you've already lost anyway.

The issue becomes remember which site corresponds to which password. I don't know about you, but I have over 150 passwords for various things. I think most people would have less, but it would suck having to check even ~10 passwords every time you forgot which one it was.
