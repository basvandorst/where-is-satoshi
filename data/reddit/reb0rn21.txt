Only retard can believe that someone can lose 700K BTC over a year and to not close the leak, move BTC to safe location!
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:40:13
I also received mail to sand my gov issued scan ID, ect and my ~38 GoxBTC were stuck there :(
Then he agree to give me back my real BTC before trade and he sand me ~33BTC to my wallet
I am not happy, I lost 5 Gox BTC which i traded, also for sure the site is a scam, sure I would not give my personal data and ID to unknown site so he can use!
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:41:51
sure true, I mean real BTC -&gt; Gox BTC was minus 5 like the original state before trade...
I was just scared by message/stuck BTC because I did not know if i am scammed or site was hacked, also did not know anything about you, and never have imagined anyone would ask me ID, etc for BTC-&gt;BTC trade on for me unknown site
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:11:00
Are you stupid or what, no ona gona rehabilitate MtGox, its the user base that count which was holding 6% of all BTC, WTF is wrong with you ppl like some of you are happy fuck for other ppl misery!!!!!!
Tomorrow if some wallet get stolen or some platform fail and you get burned I hope you will understand THEN!
@_date: 2016-06-05 23:18:57
This is a clear bank problem, the story is about them locking funds...
On the other hand she having four kids, burning cash (she got from some law crap suit prolly) and sitting on hear ass, is something that bank should not be concerned at all
So bank should not care if she is a bad person, bad mother, etc, they should give hear her cash if its not stolen
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:40:30
Why not, start you own group, find all the ppl that lost on BTC for bad decision, stolen, missing, lost private key, etc
Gather 51% should not be hard, that is what ethereum community is doing now.
I am here, transform my 50+ gox BTC to real ones, why not :d
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:14:40
Sadly ethereum shills still operate this board, your comment will be down voted as mine
Sure they look at their god to fix their stupid hyped investment, smart contract should have been tested for years before practical use, ethereum never should have be pumped over 1$ and everyone would be happy
@_date: 2016-06-09 00:20:06
if scammer and drug abuser... no big deal :)
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:03:20
He is waiting for my 1200USD :)
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:22:22
So they have unlimited funds from premine??????
[4:06:57 AM] Bill Shihara: A roll back doesn't need to affect trading if the Ethereum Foundation is going to make all of the exchanges whole.
[4:07:16 AM] Bill Shihara: we'll still be able to account for every ETH traded
@_date: 2016-06-26 02:35:02
Find someone with the DAO tokens and trade with him your gox BTC ;)
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:04:24
No one cares about Ethereum, it has nothing with bitcoin, it was 72M premined and sold to close&amp;few number of ppl, in full control of Vitalik
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:45:16
I would also like to know the list of bitcoin friendly banks... at least dealing over a exchange...
so far I learned most banks would not tell you if they will block bitcoin exchange, and if you ask most will decline
Also I think all of them have some limit over which they block all dealings with bitcoin, 10.000$, 100.000$+ or so
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:41:37
could you give me some bitcoins to prove that you have a farm? ;)
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:27:33
looks like the breakdown of banks blocking bitcoin will fade soon..... first fidor and now WB21
@_date: 2016-06-04 02:49:15
I heard about them, but they don`t still support mu country
@_date: 2016-06-09 00:22:23
I like  they have bunch of options for deposits and withdrawal to their visa, and  for depositing to my own debit card with very low fee of 1.2%for mastercard and 0% fee for Visa!
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:32:52
The hard fork end of the premined scam called ethereum
If hard fork should not be used as some investors like, many bitcoin developers lost a lot at MtGox and no one ever sad lets fork BTC!!! for my own gain!!!.
Viva decentralized and free world, death to IPO scams!
@_date: 2016-06-05 01:52:53
For me its not hard, but for newbies it is!
Maybe its the concept, but a lot more work should be done on security and usage
At least for BTC over 9000$ we need a lot more newbies :)
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:00:59
I blame it on ethereum and greed
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:13:46
At least Bitcoiners should acknowledge who their friends are, Litecoin will never try to stab Bitcoin at back, Ethereum just did that on so many levels.
Bitcoin need friends and you may call LTC a clone as any blockchain crypto is more or a less, and in long run most altcoins will bring more value to the bitcoin as well!
And why being clone is bad, we see on ethereum DAO fiasco that is not!, LTC have most of the security from the BTC

Fees are huge my croatian brothers :)
I will go a bit futher to slovenia they are in euro zone and have better fee`s!
@_date: 2016-06-01 01:23:40
I too agree BTC-e is gr8 and had eur/$ etc a long time ago, but we also know bitstamp can bring mainstream to BTC!.
Also as soon as they started accepting visa cards for buying BTC, price there is heavy bullish!
@_date: 2016-06-01 21:04:54
I presume Multibit classic is still safe?
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:30:22
I presume most cases its malware that get the full control of your PC....
rest is very hard like spoofing and data mining...
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:24:59
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:12:26
I am a true crypto supporter, love BTC and LTC, lost a lot on LTC price decline in past
I am unhappy with classic vs core fight, I read a lot smart opinions but internal fight is insane, and for sure it will do more harm do BTC, hope LTC can help, I never sow LTC as pretender to take over BTC
And I am happy today some bitcoiners see it some alts are more honest that 99% are (scam, premine, P/D, etc)
It would be shame to BTC split and media say crypto is dead, we should support inovation first and together we will be stronger!
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:13:09
I can bet its not the end, as bitcoin still wage a scaling war, miners are kinda have a need to point that they can be worked with, also core need segwit to be used to prove a point
So its kinda win - win
Also don`t forgot litecoin need to be added to coinbase in few days, also it would be also good for bitcoin that all 2nd layer stuff first be tested on litecoin
I still don`t see why we need to push just for one blochain, I cnow that litecoin is just a clone but still I would rather see fair bitcoin clone at 2nd marketcap then premined scam ETH
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:30:24
You are wrong, litecoin community is even ready to start their GPUs to help segwit activated pools, new pools are up, ppl are renting all available hashes and pointing to segwit... it will take some more time but its happening 100% "sonish"
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:31:33
Segwit maybe?
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:23:22
Or at least use HW wallet as trezor, ledger... most users are afraid of mistakes and exploits and they will never learn to use PC/mobile in a safe way, and will not run full node till its a one click solution connected to HW wallet key one day in future
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:39:13
I think it would be best if Kraken asked tier 3 verification for all claims by mtgox or the accounts that hold more then 30BTC or so!
This way we can stop thiefs, criminals and fake account to be claimed!
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:45:24
Sure I agree no point on troubling ppl with 1,5,20 BTC or so... but if someone ask for "silk road" account, I for sure would like to know who is he :)
Or Mark K. or Jeb first owner claiming some of his numbered accounts with fake info.... etc sure needed extra info
Because we can not know if mtgox database is compromised, and if its, its from close ppl with inside info
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:00:12
what is the exchange rate compared to btc-e, bitstamp etc?
0.5,1 or 2% ?
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:13:53
Anyone with real experience should tell us the exchange rate!! we know for some they are not same as top exchanges as bitstamp, btc-e but less!
I would like to know the right data!
You all post which you are using and how it works but none say the btc/$/eur rate compared to real exchange value!
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:36:39
ok anyone can tell the "real" fee when you get cash of ATM?
pls no scaling debate here ;)
@_date: 2016-05-15 12:27:32
It has to do with bitcoin also, most ppl use google or such for exchanges, pools, etc...
But I am not sure I trust what they say
@_date: 2016-05-30 01:12:10
I must say, their move to bash bitcoin is insane, ethereum is 90% premined and centralized currency 
If anyone can not see that, they are blind, stupid or insane, Also don`t start with trade volume, where?
I only see insane bots at polonix, etc which are doing 98% of trades!
If you ask me the way ethereum is hyped can only be described as SCAM!
and don`t forget we know nothing about ethereum security, future, all decided by one entity!
@_date: 2016-05-14 14:49:42
If you are from US then for sure BitPay debit or Shift!
In EU i don`t know, I am too looking
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:50:31
Vertcoin problem is its centralized by few ppl that hold 90%, don`t get me wrong but there is no decentralization there.... even mining in past 1 year were mined by few farms (sure GPU) but still pure cheap centralization
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:44:52
Everytime someone ask about bitcoin debit card topic looks like r/btc place! pls stop ppl..
I have low trust of most companies but so far I know ppl used:
1. advcash has many options
2. cex.io they have option to load most debit cards with very low fee
3. bitpay now support europe also but they have more fee
Would be nice to know reliable one with low fee
