Literally the whole economic model of bitcoin is that you need to pay a high enough fee to entice a miner to mine your transaction but you are given absolutely no information on what that number would be so giving people second chances to guess if their first guess is wrong is pretty important if bitcoin is ever going to be a real thing that is used wide scale. You can't have actual economies where someone pays 5 cents to send someone money then has to have the person wait a week to try again because oops the fee is now 6 cents.

Okay, the rule has been there for years, but two things has changed:
- Now the middleman takes money on the transaction when that wasn't the case before. 
- One of the mods is now community manager for the service. which wasn't true when the rule was written. 
Just because a rule was always there doesn't mean it's automatically still a good rule across all changing circumstances. A free tipbot service independent of the subreddit is less a weird thing than requiring a for profit middleman one of the mods gets a cut of.

In general few of the ideas of bitcoin were original and szabo clearly had a bunch of his digital currency ideas integrated by satoshi into bitcoin.

You are allowed to think bitcoin is good if you want, but the phrase "store of value" is just a weird thing to attach to a thing with no fixed price and a rapidly fluctuating value. Bitcoin has been both 175 and 500 dollars a coin this year, putting a dollar into bitcoin returns you a totally random amount of value depending on what day you spend it. It's a TERRIBLE 'store of value" (and unit of account for the same reason). 
Maybe wildly fluctuating is good and you like that but phrases mean things and it ruins it as a store of value. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:23:58
You don't assign coins to a hash either. Bitcoin under the hood works pretty different than how people assume. There is no concept of accounts. You just write whatever script you feel like for the conditions of who can do what with an output. Everyone just writes basically the same script because it's the most sensible, not because it's an inherent part of bitcoin. Satoshi sent a bunch of coins by ip address early on.

Miners get to pick which transactions they mine, in theory paying more money than everyone else will get them to mine you first but that isn't required and you can only guess what everyone else is paying since it changes day to day and second to second. You estimated wrong by no real fault of your own and learned a valuable lesson about how useful bitcoin actually is in real world situations.

Probably not. There really isn't an economic system to shovel 1 trillion dollars to one guy just based on him owning share of something regardless of if he "deserves" it or not. The economy just isn't structured to shovel that much money in cash or goods to single people like satoshi or ver that hold percentages of the bitcoin economy. Like they aren't going to shut down some countries or sign them over to early adopters just to pay out to them. (in goods or cash)

Early on there was a bug that let someone grant themselves 184 billion bitcoin, it was patched and the blockchain was rewound 50 blocks. Nothing much came of it and not many people remember it since it was so early. 
I think if it happened in modern times that would be a way bigger deal, not so much for whatever sort of programming error that let someone print their own coins, since that would be patched but because it would make it clear to a lot of people how mutable the blockchain is and how throwing out 50 blocks of transactions is just a simple thing that people can do bypassing the whole crypto thing that ends up not mattering at all.

Next time maybe it will need to be higher and maybe it'll need to be lower. There is no way to know. Some wallets will estimate but that is only based on the recent past and a new swarm of transactions can rapidly change the landscape. Likewise it all is based on a certain type of "rational" for miners and some miners try different systems like mining in order, or at random, or not mining any transactions at all and so even if you pay a lot that only makes it very likely you will get in quickly, it does not force it. There may be 3 empty blocks in a row with no transactions. And then a gap of an hour and 15 minutes of no blocks. Or all the blocks will be full and not have room for your transactions at all!

Nah, and bitcoin people will spin it in some sort of anti-intellectual triumph where having an education or working in the industry is a bad thing and these brave hero outsiders making crap up is actually good for bitcoin because they haven't had their mind clouded by things like required college math courses. 
Not every developer makes themselves public but a lot of the big ones are stuff office IT workers or people that worked on never launched MMOs in the 1990s, none of the known ones have any connection to even basic database design or anything to do with higher math and I don't think the community would even let someone with any formal education in economics even mention that if they wanted to contribute to the code.

They never have done that if you pay for cash. Also bitcoin isn't actually free to accept. You either have to do it through a middleman that charges a fee that can easily be as high or higher than credit cards OR you self accept it and have to spend a lot of money on a much higher level of security than you would have otherwise (and likely then just pay fees to cash the bitcoin out back to normal money, again at a fee that is as high or higher than credit card fees). You also have to pay money to fight lawsuits since now chargeback isn't a thing anymore and that doesn't make customer disputes just magically vanish, it makes them a court issue instead of arbitration.

@_date: 2015-11-24 13:56:54
They aren't, they are just hard to reverse. In a few cases after disasters the bitcoin blockchain has been reversed up to 50 blocks worth of transactions (in the early days of bitcoin), and altcoins that use the same technology and code as bitcoin have also had specific transactions reversed by adding special rules to the code to block specific transactions (in cases where a majority of the entire alt was stolen). As well as 51% attacks reversing transactions on smaller coins. 
Bitcoin is only difficult to reverse, requiring some majority agreement that it should happen, it is not impossible or even difficult at a conceptual level to do so.

Since they currently pay the miners about 2000 dollars a day they basically have to. That isn't nearly enough to pay for a secure network.
