They might have sharper minds, but they don't know shit. I can attest to that.

Just wait until you hit 35.

A Nuke, in our tech hub, wiping a couple trillion off the stock market in a day, and kills another trillion in human capital? Tell me how we don't collapse. 
Gas goes to $50+ a gallon as everyone with means flees every major city in the country, everyone without means loots whats left.
Everyone with plans contingent on such an event puts them into motion, both internal and external. Expect state capitols to burn.
We will be screaming for the government to suspend the constitution to find the perpetrators / protect us from further attack. Expect anyone with a uniform on their back to be a target to those not ok with this.
Literally all of the unconstitutional shit the US government has done since 9/11 is to prevent something like this from happening, it spells the end of the country.

Why do you think that? Put another way, what do you think interest rates have to do with the value of a hyper-inflating currency?

Are you being purposefully dense? FDIC insurance is only good for small contained bank failures. They don't have the ability to bail out a general collapse, unless your idea of a bail out in that circumstance is to just print a couple of Trillion dollars.

Hey idiot, since you seemed to miss the point. If someone were to say, pop off a nuke in San Francisco Bay, and the entire market collapses as a result, no fucking FDIC insurance is going to help.

Well, clearly we have nothing to worry about ever again then. Thanks for clearing that up, I was getting nervous.

So you envision the rate on an ARM going to 6798% to keep up with hyperinflation?
In any case if we have a currency crisis with huge inflation, the country will literally collapse. We will be fighting in the streets as soon as gas hits $15 a gallon.
