They get ignored here in Holland. We had 1 for net neutrality and like 300K votes. Our leaders and parties are gonna ignore it no matter what, they said. There are still things going on but it looks sad.
 At least we tried? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Btcdirect.eu let's you go to 25.000 and if you wanna sell more you can ask support. Maybe that will help. 
Anycoinsdirect need 7-14 day registration.. but you'll need the time anyway.
Or check into monaco credit card. Happy life !

Bougt btc when it was 420euro, been on the rollercoaster, adventure and have seen tons memes, stories etc. Still I don't give a fuck about the current price nor did I sell. Whats wrong with me?

I think it's fair to say. They make money using energie that could be lower, so they do waste energy in the end. It could me more efficient to say the least.

Nah it's also part of a big group on Reddit. People tent to only read titles or only one source. It's crazy but it's how it is. For example. I'm here and I also visit the Donald. Most people will say I'm retarded etc. But i also check sources other than just one just to verify or disapprove one another. For politics,crypto, economics and even global warming.. ah well. I hope more will try it tho
