Facebook is dying among younger people. The trend now is microblogging like snapchat and instagram. Although Facebook owns instagram, if it doesn't find a better and trendier product, Facebook itself can die very quickly.

Steam is making a BIG mistake. They will lose a LOT of customers. I will boycott Steam now because of this. I will stop purchasing video games on Steam. Steam is supposed to be a platform of technological innovation yet they decide to remove the support for the world's biggest and fastest growing cryptocurrency.

Steam done fucked up! Bitcoin just finished to implement lightning network which will make the transactions instant. 
Let's admit it, Steam is simply a dying platform that cannot handle the surge of value of bitcoin. But they are making a BIG mistake. They will piss off a lot of customers.

I will buy from Humble Bundle from now on, they still support bitcoin for most of their bundle.

This is great news. This new protocol will compete with other cryptocurrency in term of transaction speed. I hope bitcoin will ultimately be THE cryptocurrency and crush all the other competitors.

Why not? Some of the bitcoin were bought years ago and it used to be dirt cheap. Then since the beginning of this yeast I have been putting monthly contribution to it, about 65 to 70% of my salary and I’ve made lot of profits. The price of bitcoin is so high that I only pay a tiny fraction of bitcoin for a game which I don’t mind at all.

People have been saying this since 2010, yet there is no legit contender of Bitcoin. I think bitcoin will be the future.

I did monthly contribution since the end of last year and I have been making nothing but profit. How can you not call it safe?

Bitcoin is the safest investment, there are some dips here and there, but it is growing steadily. Bitcoin is the currency of the future and I am investing in the future right now. 
I am putting 65% of my income equally in BTC and TSLA every month. I have only made profits so far. I am buying a second Tesla next month. 
Buying bitcoin and tesla stock was the best decision of my life.

Bitcoin value will skyrocket! $100,000 - $101,000 will be reached within minutes!

Tesla and Bitcoin will be the future of humanity. People hate change but resistance is futile. I am investing everything I have into Tesla and Bitcoin, when they inevitably dominate the global market in the near future, I will laugh at the people who tried to resist change.

# We will build a firewall and prevent altcoin from entering. We will deport all the altcoin and illegals back to their shithole. WE WILL \ BITCOIN GREAT AGAIN
