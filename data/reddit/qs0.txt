CIA owned Newsweek (subsidiary) article is propaganda. Exactly, it showed no proof. That's propaganda. Who even knows what their main objective is.

How would you envision banks' Bitcoin trading to affect its price, usability, etc?

I bought bitcoins at 1000+ and I wish I'd known I could have gotten the 50 of them at say 550 today. I don't really care. 
I will hold steady. I don't care if I lose it all. I accepted the possibility when I purchased the coins. I've done a lot of securities trading and endured huge moves against me. I did alright. 
I think bitcoin is a great &amp; unique system that will catch on mainstream, and that its price will rise accordingly. 
Edit: if the price keeps dropping, I'm going to buy even more - and at a much better price.

High volume on the selling. Low volume on the buying.

Good point on them not giving a refund had the price moved the opposite way

That's an impressive answer. Are you an accountant or do you work in finance?

Do you have any advice on how to not get burned buying Bitcoins? I'm a bit afraid of just depositing money into a strangers account only to wait for him to transfer the Bitcoins to my Bitcoin account.

Worked with a great salesman at a hedge fund who couldn't help himself buying high and selling low. He made tons of money getting clients to invest in their funds, but he lost all the money he made trading like shit in his personal accounts.  Sounds like the guys op is talking about.

If you've bought Bitcoins from a reputable seller on localbitcoins, can you PM or direct message me a name?
I'm not sure whether to distrust Chase or the seller I was dealing with.

Why block out your last name and not your first in your posted pics? Your first name is Martin. Your username is mgrunin. It doesn't take a genius to figure your name is probably Martin Grunin.
