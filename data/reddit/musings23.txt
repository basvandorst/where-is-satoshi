Crucial question all, should I keep the thumbnail of the hot bitcoin girl (good photoshop memories for me) or the rocket about to launch?

Better to regulate as they are planning to in the UK! Serious backwards step from the US Government...

cheers man, has been a fun couple of months putting it together :)

Agree here, hoping a few more will follow the UKs thinking though... Much more progressive, can only mean good things for the UK

Bitcoin, why didn't we think of this before...

Wonder how much Bitcoin it would take for Tenacious D to do a proper version :)

Agreed, a currency is just an accepted means of exchange for which both parties accept that there is a set value associated

The fee bypass issue is discussed here... 
And isn't thought to be an issue by Emin, as by taking this approach the user and miner would be reducing their chance of the microblock involved being built on by the next miner. Essentially they would be shooting themselves in the foot.
Can you explain your difference in opinion?
@_date: 2017-02-16 21:45:28
Just FUD, maybe referring to the influence of the Ethereum Foundation over the direction of the protocol, maybe referring to the recent support for Enterprise Ethereum from the likes of Microsoft, who knows....

In Bitcoin it's best to wait for a couple of confirmations to be sure that you have received the Bitcoin. Bitcoin wallets generally show the amount of confirmations associated with a transaction. By confirmations what we are talking about is how far back your transaction was first included in the blockchain. i.e. one confirmation is your transaction was included in the most recent block. Two confirmations means your transaction was included in the block before the most recent block.
With each confirmation the risk of the transaction being reversed (because of something like a double spend attack) decreases substantially. If you see the Bitcoin in your wallet with a couple of confirmations then you should be ok. For large values of bitcoin the generally accepted number of confirmations to wait is 6 confirmations (takes around an hour given the time between blocks is on average 10 mins).
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:21:07
The transaction fee is usually added by whatever Bitcoin wallet you are using. There tends to be an option to specify the transaction fee within the wallet, often using a sliding bar but will depend on the wallet. Yeah 6 cents is too little a fee... probably need more like 20 to 30 cents for it to go through in a decent time, that's because blocks are pretty full at the moment and there is quite a lot of competition for space.

Once purchased it is advisable to move your coins to a wallet for which you and only you hold the private keys. If you don't then you run the risk of your bitcoins being lost in the case of Coinbase being hacked/going bankrupt. Coins held in an online wallet are effectively an IOU from the wallet provider. Look up Mt Gox hack or Bitfinex hack if you want examples of where coins have been lost in online wallets.
However it should be said that moving coins to an offline wallet does come with its own set of dangers, such as keyloggers, loss of passwords/private keys. Many people recommend a hardware or paper wallet for storing larger amounts. Key bit of advise is to have multiple back up copies of your private key/password across different physical locations.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:56:27
oh and make sure you move your Bitcoins off the exchange after purchase into a wallet for which you control the private keys.
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:42:00
There are various wallets that you could choose from:
Most will have no link to your identity unless maybe you are using a web wallet like Coinbase in which case you may have to link an email address and maybe even provide further personal details.
Goes without saying but do your homework on the meet, I assume local bitcoins have some guidelines on the safety considerations of how to make bitcoin cash purchases face to face.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:55:02
A TX is a transaction. Within every transaction you make, you need to include a fee in order for the transaction to be processed by the network. Technically speaking, this fee incentivizes miners who construct the blocks of the blockchain to include your transaction in their block. In this way your transaction gets added to the blockchain. How high you set the fee determines how quickly the transaction is included in the blockchain, as all users making transactions are effectively competing for a limited amount of space within blocks.
Bitcoin can be traded on various exchanges, my advise to a beginner who believes that the value of Bitcoin is going to increase would be simply to purchase an amount of Bitcoin and hold onto it. Don't bother trying to make extra money daytrading, it won't work out. Once purchased on an exchange make sure you move your Bitcoins into an offline wallet. Do not leave your Bitcoins on the exchange as if the exchange goes bust or is hacked you will most likely lose your coins!
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:43:32
Yep that's more accurate now
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:55:56
Loving the civility!
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:47:00
Agree that the best way is just to buy Bitcoins on an exchange and hold on to them for the medium to long term
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:24:47
Terminology was fine... it's just that trusting your bitcoin to a third party (e.g. a bank or exchange) kind of defeats the point of bitcoin. You aren't truly in possession of your bitcoin unless you and only you are in possession of your private keys.
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:38:52
Can't you do this on a testnet? Also your comments regarding Ethereum don't make any sense, Ethereum is currently capable of a higher transaction per second rate than Bitcoin. Plus, Ethereum should have it's second layer Raiden network in a couple of months as opposed to Bitcoin's Lightning network which is blocked by a lack of Segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:54:42
I'd prefer to use secure hardware enabled payment channels rather than bitcoin banks.

Can anyone give an overview of what the privacy compromise actually is? I can't make it out from the paper.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:37:44
What you are missing is that a decent proportion of the r/btc community would be satisfied by such a compromise. And getting those guys on board would give us the critical mass needed to move forward.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:23:44
Yes, I am saying that a significant portion would be happy to do so. Probably actually most of those who have moderate views. They may even prefer emergent-consensus in an ideal world, but would take 2MB hard fork plus segwit if it overcomes the current stalemate and capacity issues.
They may hope that emergent-consensus is eventually adopted as a longer term fix, but that can be discussed later on its own merit and decoupled from the segwit release if we make the compromise now.

The bitcoins were I there I believe but Mt Gox trading bots were inflating demand. There has been previous analysis that uncovered this. Possibly the exchange owners were creating money out of thin air on their exchange and crediting it to themselves in order to fund the spending by the bots.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:32:45
Yep, no Mt Gox trading bots artificially pushing up the price this time round. Just solid demand...
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:01:33
True, people didn't want to sell bitcoin on Gox as it was so difficult to withdraw fiat. Hence less supply and ultimately a higher price compared to other exchanges
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:25:52
If fixed line internet access is eventually retired because of this type of technology. Then we won't have a choice
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:06:38
Bots are fine if they are placing genuine orders backed by real money which I don't believe was the case with the Gox bots

One of the problems with Bitcoin NG was the potential to DDOS the key block finder (leader). How is this prevented here?

Agreed, this could be misleading otherwise.
