Make it more user friendly like GetGems: [Tipping]( [buying](
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:02:50
The gemz adds more fun, and my girl likes it; the app gives you a choice to use bitcoin too, people whine too much. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 01:18:56
telegram is certainly more secure than skype
@_date: 2015-07-25 00:56:46
[whatsapp be like](
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:51:40
Hey, this sounds great. But I wonder how safe the app is, considering that people can now hack bank accounts. It won't be very hard to hack something like this? 
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:28:49
The point is 65 M Telegram users now can use bitcoin easier than all other services. They can give commands straight from the Telegram app (which is mainstream) and without the app they won't give a shit about Bitcoin so Julia brings Bitcoin to them kapish? Without Telegram/GetGems you won't be able to do this..

for 1 satoshi? lol

You sound like your life is depending on this Thread.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:41:54
It doesn't have bitcoin support tho and it's not popular, where i live nobody uses it. Almost everyone uses whatsapp and to a less degree telegram, don't know if its good or bad but thats where mainstream is, smart thing to focus on these.
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:47:39


don't take my fb man, i have some convos hitting on girls which i want to have.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:22:56
I tried it, magical experience.
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:26:58


Don't you think it's good for Bitcoin when a guy shows interest with a platform which has a userbase of probably 40x more than the entire Bitcoins userbase? Isn't Bitcoins aim to go mainstream? Satoshi made it for mainstream. Bitcoin allows you to chose which service to choose, such influential people tweeting about Bitcoin is to me great to see.
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:49:44


I don't know where you look at but Bitcoin has been evolving tremendously through the years. You sure you didn't sell at 1000?


wtf, it's actually the best money for mainstream. Its technology is groundbraking and much faster, easier and cheaper to use, hence why all the banks are interested in it. Changing a complete money system backed by governments militairy power isn't that easy, but i personally see Bitcoin is slowly going mainstream and i believe it eventually will.
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:17:39
Thanks, i like this approach, focussing more on mainstream newbie users, good luck.
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:06:17
It's not as bad as you think, i don't think anyone got screwed by using Telegram for their daily text messaging sessions.
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:11:34
Yes we know blockchain technology can do that already, we knew it years ago, these guys just woke up.
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:51:48
Easiest wallet from my experience is Telegram with GetGems [Android]( [iOS]( to send you btc she doesn't need addresses or qr codes and it's instantly received to your wallet if you have it aswell. It's an app, so easy to download on the app or play store. 
And it's compatible with Coinbase aswell where she can buy btc from within the app by just typing the amount. See how 
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:08:55
Good job, this puts a shield in front of the community and bitcoin against criminal banks and bitcoin haters.
@_date: 2015-09-09 20:56:08
This blockchain only bulshit is annoying as fck, downvoted.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:07:41
It's a wallet and a messenger with some cool stuff, i have my bitcoin in it and works good. it s a social wallet, good for me because i text message alot and got my bitcoibns hooked to it even better now with sticker packs, rewards and store, good for non tech people. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 20:06:56
getgems is clean for me i dont have issues, i had one but they fixed it for me pretty fast, it has high rating, i like the store, stickers and rewards, also i like to tip in groups which others apps dont offer, for some people its just more fun, i respect your choice tho but thanks im cool.
Just looked at telebit tho i find gg more user friendly, on a sidenote his mom has an iphone 6 where telebit wallet is not available on.
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:18:41
I use mobile wallet no need to backup nigga, using it for a long time never an issue.
@_date: 2015-10-16 09:43:34
It's a wallet and an instant messenger, send and receive from QR code is possible aswell. but if u want to send btc to your contacts you can just type like 1 btc and tap on send.
@_date: 2015-10-10 10:24:11
Yea right everyone who comments on getgems topics must be the same account
Doesnt matter you are still using social media which probably can be checked by the nsa which makes u a damn hypocryte so u have no right to critisize. You are just a bully trying to push your silly agenda on start ups bringin bitcoin technology to social media and i bet ceobitcoin is just another account of yours. And yes getgems won the most visionary social media solution during a mobile challenge hosted by citi, but dont worry getgems devs are here to get mainstream users in the bitcoin ecosystem and an airbitz/mycelium shill to come out and talk shit on other start ups is the lowest u can go. U might aswell stalk changetip cus they are doing similar things. Luckily 95% of getgems users are outside this dark crypto space made by no life paid shills like u. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:16:17


says the guy whos constantly on reddit, social media is everywhere and everyone uses it, without it even bitcoin woudn't succeed..u have no clue what ur talking about.
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:52:39
Ii actually doubt just because of this post suddenly alot people would do this, probably a small amount but so what. If someone offers something nice why not.
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:42:23
Hi i want to send Gemz to the app, do i have to send it to the Bitcoin address? 
Also this is great i'm going to make a coin for our clan in CSGO haha.
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:56:04
[getgems]( lets you communicate directly with the other person, sending btc as easy as typing a message, uses SPV aswell, if u are an active im user u'll like it.
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:59:31
whats wallet32? never heard of it
