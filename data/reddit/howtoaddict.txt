You have address generators that aim for certain string of characters. It's brute force process - you generate private key, then determine public key and wallet address.
And after 1,000,000,000s of iterations you may stumble upon wallet with address you like.

I came to regret this comment... madman seems to actually done it (didn't have stomach to watch). As to benefits of 1 BTC vs 2 BTC - it's the same as benefits of owning $10,000 or $20,000.

I've done backup recovery after firmware update... you do whole process on the Ledger which is nice... takes some time to enter all 24 words though ;)
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:15:11
If you are ever worrying about safety of your BTC - definitely bite the bullet and go for it. As for best value &amp; price tag - looking at features I would definitely go again with $60 for Ledger Nano S vs $100 for Trezor. Both devices are great, but for anyone price sensitive you don't lose anything by going with Ledger for $60.

For me problem with Coinbase is that they are in control. Like if you can't access their website (it happened recently) all you can do is email them and hope they will respond.
But true - if you don't want to get into securing your BTC and don't want to safeguard credentials - Coinbase is much better storage then going through wallet setup on your own.
As for me worrying about "losing hardware wallet" or "corrupt file" - it doesn't work like that. All you need is to write down 24 word seed and store in safe location and that's it. It doesn't matter if you lose hardware wallet or something happens to it... so long you have that 24 word seed you can recover your funds through various options (like Electrum wallet).
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:05:19
Master seed is generated on device and you navigate the process using two buttons that are present on Ledger. Restore is also done the same way - you actually enter 24 words used for master seed by pressing those two buttons. I was surprised by how well whole process is implemented and how everything is done using device screen and buttons.
As for Chrome extension - yeah you are right that you can use other browsers... but I hope you get what I am saying. I would prefer "standalone apps". They probably picked Chrome apps because they are easier to develop + work across platforms... and it's not big deal... but again - I would prefer something completely independent. Not big deal though.

The problem is that we are at the point where it is extremely hard to even supply "good vs bad". As a programmer myself I am terrified at level of complexity bitcoin is currently at... not code-wise, but "wider-impact-wise". 
And you can see that in this "how to scale discussion". Basically we are at 1 MB blocks for like past few years. Code changed needed to switch to 2 MB blocks? For Core it's like few lines of code. However, those few lines would impact how fast blockchain grows, how fast it can propagate between nodes, what can be supported down the road, etc, etc.
So, something that can be done in like essentially 5 minutes has turned into few years of discussion. I'm truly sad to witness the continuing discussion and just wish everyone had more sense when constant for max block size was initially discussed... proposal from big blockers was first 20 MB (Gavin), and then 8 MB (Chinese miners)... both were pretty big increases from 1 MB. 
On the other hand kneejerk reaction of Core devs - to force this 1 MB limit and "let market find solution for limitation" is equally troubling. I mean, I understand them, if I was Core developer and tasked with maintaining Bitcoin I would also prefer "feed the pigs and don't touch anything". Plus lots of them have equity in startups that push sidechains - that's not bad in itself, but having millions of $$$ invested in certain outcome sure makes it easier to lean that way.

I too applaud what he did - i.e. use the money for what's worth most to you. If you would have doubts that HODLing goes against student loans of your children - sell.
One thing that you haven't address is what interests me - how did you deal with tax liabilities? I.e. if you made like $50K on BTC now IRS and state you live in will probably be looking for it's share of that (1/3 to 1/2). How did you determine your profits (price at which you purchased BTC - price at which you sold)?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:27:24
I loved the part where says "Looking forward to reading r/bitcoin every day. **Sigh...**". Because truly the biggest pressure  of HODLing is reading all the opposing opinions that come out daily. If you decided to HODL the biggest favor you can do yourself is to set automated buys, have hardware wallet and **STOP reading / stressing**. I've wrote about that extensively:

I absolutely agree that there is way bigger demand in US over last few days. And we are yet to see all those backed up blocks in Blockchain. 
But there is absolute boom going on in China. Just take a look at what is going on with their currency devaluation and the fact that BTC-USD is up 8% and BTC-CNY is up 16%.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:09:28
Chinese exchanges do have history of falsifying volume. What worries me more than traffic are Chinese mining cartels... I think that 60-70% of BTC mining is now done in China. That's pretty big number for decentralized system.

If you look at my history I was actually talking about exactly the same point lately. But, it's matter of perspective. Will enough people see the BTC the way you and me do? And if huge price increase happens will the landscape stay the same? Or will governments do something stupid like regulate BTC into ground because they feel this is threat to their national currencies?
I've tried finding "the best of Facebook comments on bitcoin" but failed - there were few threads lately posted here showing people on Facebook posting COMPLETELY CRAZY comments on bitcoin. Like that it is monopoly money. They simple don't understand BTC. (If someone can find funny Facebook comments on Bitcoin please post as reply).
Currently all the gold in the world is worth around $7 trillion. Even if BTC pegs at 1% of all the gold (super conservative) it should be at $70 billion. And in distant future I doubt that gold will be more valuable then BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-20 19:09:10
Yeah... that's what really gets me with these exchanges. If you need ANY help - you are pretty much screwed... they'll just keep dragging you through prepared Q&amp;A without doing anything to actually help.

@_date: 2017-01-14 16:25:17
I think your perception is working against you. You say "gains on gains" but if you calculate rate of return it's less then 10% on yearly basis. Long term you can expect less than 7%... stock market had a bull run lately (I did ~20% yearly avg return last 3 years) Am still kicking myself for not investing more in AMZN, though.
It's similar to when you look at dividend stocks. It may confuse you into picking bad stock because yield is so high. In the long run all peripheral stuff doesn't matter... avg yearly return is all the counts.
With all that said Google "bitcoin lending". You can lend BTC you hold and get passive income. Note that people do DEFAULT on their loans a lot. Lenders wouldn't be able to get 7% returns if there wasn't high rate of defaults. Maybe this is "gains on gains" you are looking for ;). Let me know ;)

I dunno... I think that FB at $320b is way riskier than BTC at $15b. Legal threats and all that stuff was a big perceived risk for me... but considering pull whole BTC industry now has in USA (not to mention new administration, people in it, and ties they have to BTC), problems worldwide with currency (India, Venezuela)... I would think benefits and support far outweigh the risks.
Don't get me wrong - I am not saying BTC will be $10K in 2018. What I am saying is that it definitely will be growing next 5-10 years.

Value Averaging is more active strategy then DCA. Sure, if you have finance knowledge go for it. Average person is better off keeping things simple. 
And another thing I always forget - any strategy that includes selling will add tax reporting burden. Again, not a showstopper for someone who is into finance. But I doubt majority of people here would be excited with calculating and reporting their BTC to USD earnings every year and figuring out how much tax they should pay. Then again you do have no-sell Value Averaging...
In any case, if after reading what I wrote here you still believe you can suggest VA that's as simple as DCA - write up detailed comment and reply... I'll gladly emphasize comment from post and let people decide if what you suggest is better for them.
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:49:26

As long as you can automate - go for whatever you believe is good investment. Like buy $8 BTC daily and $2 doge. I don't know that many exchanges support buy $10 BTC daily, then convert later during the day $2 of that into Doge. But if they do - you can do that also. Just NO MANUAL BUYS.
The whole point of what I wrote is true investing &amp; disconnecting yourself. Too many people look at BTC trading as hobby. I've tried that path and went crazy from reading all the articles, trying to time market, estimate currencies and so on and so forth. $1000 to $180 is not fun.
If I'm looking for hobby - I'll go for something less stressful... something that's repeatable, controllable, enjoyable, etc. BTC trading is all but that.
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:52:10
Before anything else - I love your analysis. The biggest problem I have with VA - you said it yourself - I don't know any place where you can invest into BTC in tax sheltered account.
Even if I did; I'm not sure I would go with Value Average because it would require me to make more decisions. Especially not for 0.5% gains. On BTC/USD I would not go for VA even if you I got 10-20% better result. Because predicting volatile commodity like BTC/USD is invitation to go mad. 
I mean just look last 5 years. There is not a single person that said: OK, it'll go from 1 to 30, then crash back to 3... then after six months in span of 30 days it'll go from 6 to 160 (!?!?!), go back to 80 and after 3 months shoot back above 180... and yeah... in a year you'll have $1000+ moonshot
I get why VA may be exciting for some people. With volatile commodity like BTC if you are able to snip of those peaks - sell high, buy back low - you are in for a KILLING. You'll basically 2x,3x maybe even 4x your returns. But, me personally - I'll pass. Too much stress.

The way responded it seems they are definitely reporting to IRS. My report shows I've lost money on "selling" BTC...
What's funny is that people could use these reports to claim loss on tax returns. Complete and utter mess...
**EDIT:** OK, since and other Coinbase support personnel here are trying to act as if we are "conspiracy chasing idiots", let me clarify. I understand IRS is extremely hard on you as company. However, that should MOTIVATE you as a company to HELP your customers. Not motivate you as a company to shift responsibility, drop ball and then play victim. Considering you know as company how tough dealing with IRS can be, you should well know how tough it is to deal with IRS as an individual.
During this day **Coinbase employees** have dropped the ball few times. Let's go through the history, shall we:
1. posts comment that this thread links in which she says "All outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those bitcoin." She doesn't comment on IRS reporting questions.
2. posts comment on this thread and basically confirms what gdax-rosie says. He doesn't address IRS reporting questions at all sticking to PR talk
3. - now you come and finally address IRS reporting question.
During the whole process we are completely skipping the important questions like:
1. Why implement labels in report in that manner. Why not provide additional clarifications in the report?
2. Why go with "All outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those bitcoin."? People calling you out for "covering your asses" are completely right. You are not trying to protect your customers, you are trying to protect yourselves.
3. Why doesn't Coinbase system provides explicit notifications when sending BTC out considering it's impact on tax returns? I have been customer of Coinbase for 5 years and I HAD NO FREAKING IDEA you guys handle stuff this way.
**EDIT EDIT:** responded below, [here is direct link]( I appreciate his effort to clean up confusion - he is providing answers and showing he cares... that's all I can ask for.
So to provide **TLDR** of what Coinbase claims for anyone too bored/busy to read through s***storm of posts:
1. **===Coinbase does not automatically report transactions to IRS===**
2. **Fields in report Coinbase generates specifies outgoing transactions as sales** (I've generated one moments ago and checked). agrees that report could be implemented/labeled better.
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:53:11
What is crazy is that I think BTC can easy hit capitalization of $200 billion (Facebook market cap currently is like $320 billion currently).
But at that price it's like $13,000 per BTC... crazy...
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:18:55
People are freaking out because dealing with IRS (or any government agency for that matter) is EXTREMELY demanding. Like, I report EVERYTHING correctly and then need to spend 6 months of my life dealing with sending **faxes** to prove I did everything right.
What Coinbase is doing here is big FU to customers. I understand they want to transfer liability, but they could be more open about it - why don't they have popup showing reporting to IRS whenever you perform action triggering that?
If anyone has suggestion on Coinbase alternative - reply. And also, if has suggestion on what I can do so that my Coinbase BTC purchases are not reported to IRS - let me know. I can move BTC to Coinbase cold storage or something. I simply want to buy BTC from USD and keep holding BTC without that being reported to IRS.
@_date: 2016-12-03 03:08:43

My own view is that Bitcoin as "original crypto" will always be at least store of value.
Lots of people disagree with this stance - and then it becomes a discussion. Like can you really have store of value without medium of exchange. I then say that gold stayed store of value in modern world... then people point out that history of gold is way longer than history of Bitcoin... it quickly becomes subjective.
Do I believe that some other crypto may overtake Bitcoin in value? Sure... it's very likely scenario. But I think it'll be like $800B cap for that currency vs $700B cap for Bitcoin... rather than for example Bitcoin crashing and say Ripple staying at $8B.

I don't often open with: part of the Bitcoin value is in deflating actual debt bubble... guess I'll need to correct that.
Because when you do look at Bitcoin from that angle it's much more understandable how it explodes in value vs fiat.
As for people who look at Bitcoin as stock... yeah - that's crazy. I found amusing when Buffet said that "Bitcoin is like a check". So, it's not only newbies that are confused.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:59:10
Who, me? If yes - then I'm sure you would be surprised ;)
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:11:55
I think you are looking this too much from first world perspective. I agree that for someone in first world banking system it doesn't make much sense to switch from USD to Bitcoin. You don't want tax burden of operating in another currency and then calculating profit for each transaction.
But switch your thinking to Venezuela for example and you can easily see the use case for Bitcoin. In first world I think that Bitcoin for time being will primary be store of value. It is fantastic for that.
As for prices going up... it's more of people realizing the potential of technology. Bitcoin economy is growing. More people are getting into the system. Things are changing.
On that sense - I agreed with observation of someone else that bitcoin is definitely NOT a scam... but at present moment could be a bubble. I agree - time will give us answer on that.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:44:19
Yeah - I think most of the people in developed countries miss that. Bitcoin can effectively replace banking infrastructure for fraction of the cost. There is no clearing house, settlement, employees... It's HUGE deal.

I too wish there was a way to jumpstart Bitcoin without crazy electricity usage. But, it proved to be extremely effective exploit of human greed. Note that this electricity usage is not "requirement"... it's just that MORE AND MORE AND MORE people are pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into mining hoping to upset balance of hashpower.
As for impact on climate change - it more has to do with how you produce power. In that sense, if Bitcoin makes building new hydro / wind plants more feasible because of electricity requirements - it's actually plus.

I think that at current point it doesn't matter much what is primary usage of Bitcoin. Look at all trading platforms built around Bitcoin. Look at all blogs / news sites. Local meeting groups.
There is huge economy already built around Bitcoin. Economy that won't go away even if price crashes back below $1000. People like me won't go away even if price is again below $1. It's more about cyberpunk and value system than whatever current BTC/USD rate is.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:02:19
Considering daily trading volume of over $3 BILLION - a lot.
As for concrete numbers... right now on Gdax (which is just one out of 100s of available exchanges) there is market for buying ~850 BTC for $7000+. So if you have 850 Bitcoins you can swap them for $6 million and ACH that money to your bank right away. No need to wait a week.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:21:37
I agree with your observation - I actually advised few ALL IN people to stay away when BTC was breaking $5000. Of course, now they are pissed at me... it's just that human mentality of seeking big win.
There is no "foolproof short term investment". Bitcoin is definitely not that.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:53:35
Yes, which is why I tell people NOT to go ALL IN. Investing is not so much about predicting general trend... as staying with your decision, timing, investment cost, etc etc.
I've got bulk of my Bitcoins at $200 or less... and didn't do it for "get rich"... but I quite like the technology. Even if it crashed and burned all the way to $0 I wouldn't mind... as long as crypto-currencies live in some form and make the world a better place.

Heh - didn't we all fall into that cynicism trap ;). I've noted few things you've posted and am glad you are doing it - we need consensus builders. I'm just glad Maxwell figured out that ASICBOOST role in all this... should make building consensus for improvements to BTC way easier. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:53:15
Interesting breakdown of your thought process... I definitely need to start reading more stuff you publish. Watching your work over past few years -&gt; you often come across as pretty arrogant and stubborn. Could be that you are too tired of arguing same points over and over. As a fellow programmer, I know how that's like. 
But in the end - as long as you keep producing like you've produced in past people like me sure love having you in the ecosystem. So, another thanks for all your fine work - keep it up!
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:39:11
Yeah, it's hard explaining to people everything that happened in last few months, let alone last few years. The weirdest thing in this whole mess for me is that even Jihan will benefit from your work - even more than if he succeeded with his idiotic hidden agenda (hide advantage, keep lying on motives, slowly centralize mining).
So - thanks again in name of all of us who have high hopes for BTC. It's not about BTC/USD, it's not about tech, it's about building currency that's truly decentralized, used by many and improves the world. People like you are who will make that happen.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:17:17
Well, depends how you look at it. Bitcoin went through what was effectively extended civil war. You got to give some credit to Etherum that's run like benevolent dictatorship. XRP also done impressive job. And finally, biggest impact - we had recent surge of ICOs.
Wait ICO fad to pass and you'll see BTC marketshare rising back up. I mean - BCH forked like a month ago and it's  in Marketcap.
So - sure - there is some value in betting on   and  (my personal favorite is Litecoin). But you'll always have Pareto principle of 80/20... and I'm am somewhat confident that BTC will always be the leader of top pack (50%+ of marketshare).

Switch to dollar cost averaging. Look up my profile for posts I've made on subject + app I've coded to do this automatically. If anyone is interested more into subject, reply to this comment and let me know... I can expand for those to lazy to click through my history ;)

Hahahaha..... man, if I ever need link to "average Redditor profile"... now I have it. Now off you go to @_date: 2017-09-06 15:32:10
And to add one note: the biggest advantage of BTC also ended up being the biggest problem. Decentralization. There is no single, strong leadership in BTC. 
We don't have Zuckerberg to say FCK HTML5 and then switch to mobile apps ASAP like he did when company bounced back from $20/stock. We don't have to make arbitrary development decisions effectively saying: comply or GTFO. and other devs have power, but it's nowhere near even plain executive power.
So, of course, you'll see that leave impact in times of crisis. But now that Segwit is finally live and BCH forked, steady times are ahead of us. And you'll see that in marketshare. I just hope that Segwit2x doesn't turn into another multi-year shitshow ;).

Welcome fellow HODLer! I just hope you've automated that $50 week buy... it gets boring after a while... and being here and watching all the BTC drama unfold can be quite stressful ;)
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:35:14
For someone new to crypto I would recommend Coinbase.com . They have autobuy... although fees are higher. Then as you grow more confident you can get hardware wallet and switch to GDax for buying.
As for how much you need to start investing - even $1 is OK. I highly recommend dollar cost averaging - instead of tracking price and "buying dips" which is recipe for depression and disaster - just determine what is daily amount of $$$ you don't need and set Bitcoin autobuy.
Look at history of my posts here on Reddit - I've wrote about it in more detail few months back.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:33:57
Fees are one of the key reasons I did this. When you buy through Coinbase there was like $0.15 + 3% fee for transaction. So you can't easily set $1 daily buy.
With GDax you deposit say $30 through ACH on which there is NO FEE. And then you pay like $0.02 per transaction. I just looked my transaction from today... I've bought $10 worth of Bitcoin and fee was $0.012.
Now I'm trying Coinbase... and DAMN... $10 BTC buy has fee of... $0.99 LOL. 10% is quite a fee.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:32:07
Man, I love XMR... but not many Cryptos have great development team behind them. Do you really wanna send new people even toward XMR (which is established crypto) when stuff like this happens: 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:48:02
Pretty much. Although I'm not sure you'll ever lose with investing in BTC if you are HODLing for 5+ years.
I've posted about constant buying of Bitcoin few months back when BTC was like $900. And I've been buying BTC from when it was $200.
I even made opensource utility that now auto buys for me from GDAX. If anyone is interested in app - let me know.
**EDIT:** Source has been on Github for quite a while now -  . I'll also update latest compiled release now that so many of you replied. It would be good if someone with C# knowledge reviewed it independently... I am obviously here to answer any questions that you have. And also I have a [blog on motivation and bitcoin]( that I actively maintain so you can reach me there always.
 To the moon my HODL brothers.
EDIT EDIT: Here is the release that was promised  (tnx to for bugfixes) . Now - if you are not trusting stranger on the Internet - that's smart. In that case follow setup instructions I left and give API keys permission to buy, not deposit/withdrawal. Again - any questions or critiques - let me know... I'm here and not going anywhere as you can see from my post history.

Yeah, most people missed this ;). His advice is against shorting, he said: **Bitcoin can go to $100,000 before it goes down**

North Korea is my favorite part. Like how exactly does he pictures someone from North Korea using Bitcoin? That's my thought exercise for the day - figuring out how I as North Korean would get a smartphone, then how I would get Internet connection...

@_date: 2017-09-13 19:05:39
I understand THIS ^ is the fear most people have. I had it too. But then Bitcoin became billion dollar currency. Now it's 60 billion dollar currency.
Simply there is too much money already in game for Bitcoin to be successfully shut down through government. Look at what big corporations get Congress to do just with $5-$6 million donations. Look what Peter Thiel did with $10+ million lawsuit.
And on top of that with Bitcoin - you are the GOOD guy. You are the same guy that said "go Internet" when there were some saying "oh, international communication network - NO, it'll be used for spying, terror and nasty stuff". Or go even further back in time - radio... it's easy to see that same battle of scared people saying "Oh no, someone will use it to broadcast something BAD".
Now, don't get me wrong:
 THERE WILL BE HUGE BATTLE FOR THIS
Hell, thinking about it - it's been battle for years now. It's just that most recently joined and haven't been up to date on all the stuff that's been going on in Congress in 2013-2014 for example. I mean now we actually have lots of politicians in Congress that support Bitcoin. We have tech billionaires that support Bitcoin. In the end it's another freedom we the people need to fight for... and will eventually get it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:37:28
Way more people interested than I expected ;). Now I'll definitely need to update binaries and project.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:22:59
We might also look into shutting down WiFi... and restrict access to radio technology to ensure someone doesn't use it to broadcast for nefarious purposes.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:08:57
I only wish I made this utility back then. Thinking about that time... man... when I remember BTC faucets. In "the early days" there were websites that were giving like 1 BTC per IP. And nobody bothered.
As for getting others involved - at this point I don't think anything matters. BTC is already mainstream and is here to stay. Segwit happened and it's cruising from here. Definitely gonna enjoy this ride.

You likely haven't assigned **View** Privilege (and trade) to API key when creating it (checkboxes above Passphrase): 
Or API key / Secret Key / passphrase is wrong (less likely because you copy-pasted)
Let me work on giving more user friendly API errors... and in the meantime you can verify that API key you entered has appropriate permissions.

I actually wanted to do Python port... when this Reddit storm ends if there is still enough interest I'll likely do it.
I go for market price... and in 99.99% there is enough liquidity to fill even big orders orders right away. What I am doing is definitely not for advanced traders...
It's just standard Windows app that you can run on your laptop. I did it that way purposefully - more customer friendly way would be to build website. But then credentials would be on the server I would need to secure. I touched on the in [FAQ on Gdax BTC hoarder github page](
If I do python version then Raspberry pi would make sense. But even then API keys are vulnerable if someone steals your Rasperry pi... the only secure way would be require you to enter password when starting app on Rasperry pi and keep decrypted API keys in RAM.
Ideal solution if you ask me is for GDax to directly support autobuys through their website. Maybe if or end up reading this and they point it to Coinbase dev team it'll happen. Hell, I would code support for this in GDax myself if they gave me opportunity.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:46:26
Step 1. Write a wrapper over HTTP Rest API Gdax has... here are docs: 
Step 2. Code Windows Form C# app that uses wrapper from Step 1 and has Timer thread that executes HTTP calls depending on what user sets through UI
Step 3. Answer comments on Reddit ;)

I think the split was probably the best thing that could've happened. Everybody was scared - OMG OMG WHAT IF FORK HAPPENS - and now that it happened... damn -&gt; free money and way less drama. Honestly, wish that fork happened way sooner so that focus remained on development and not flame wars.

Pretty much. Coinbase raised so much money because it makes Bitcoin easy to purchase and hold for non-technical users. So, for start - sure - open account with them, buy and hold it with them.
Then, when you want to "go deeper" you can look into hardware wallet and holding your BTC yourself. Note that this is not without risk - hardware wallet is not as important as your seed... which you need to secure... you need to think what will happen in case of fire for example...
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:03:21
You've set API keys right... so it must be something else. 
What you are saying about not having funds in account - it could be that. Let's continue with PMs... nice to finally have someone other than myself testing and using the app ;)

Guys, you know what's weird - I've just WATCHED part of his interview... and I don't think the guy truly trashed Bitcoin.
 It's more that he doesn't understand how it works + journalists spinning his words for page clicks to articles.
To quote him: 
 "If you are in Venezuela or North Korea, you better USE Bitcoin..."
But then he craps the bed with "... but you can't possible choose to use it in United States". Outside of obvious LOL on using Bitcoin in North Korea (good luck with getting that sweet Internet connection) - even he understand the value of Bitcoin as decentralized currency.
But he fails to understand that TRULY DECENTRALIZED component. He thinks that "governments will shut down Bitcoin as soon as it's used for nefarious purposes". Which... I mean... he simply DOESN'T get the word DECENTRALIZED. 
It's like he is oblivious that Bitcoin now also has huge POLITICAL support. People that are billionaires are now holding Bitcoin and good luck battling with them to get governments to act as you want. And even if we disregard Bitcoin holders who are in positions of power - UN can't figure out joint action and solution on North Korea even after huge nuclear test. Compared to that, does anyone truly believe there could be joint international government action on Bitcoin?
And even if you somehow magically get ALL governments in the world to ban Bitcoin... how exactly do you shut it down from technical perspective? When you can't shut down Torrent - how exactly do you shut down something like Bitcoin?
This all reminds me of that time when **Warren Buffet said that Bitcoin is like checks**. It's just that some of those big names don't understand Bitcoin and then journalists spin their words for page clicks.
But hey... got to buy BTC today for discount, so - all good.
Video I watched here: 
In the end -&gt; how I wish someone would ask him: "OK Jamie, there is this decentralized thing called the Internet - it was ACTIVELY USED for decades now for bunch of vile and bad things - how do we shut it down?". Bonus points for expanding talk into Great Firewall of China, Tor, VPNs, etc.
EDIT: OK, last thing to close my rant - **I wish people in power had clarity and wisdom to realize how revolutionary Bitcoin is. And how it is impossible to stop.** When I see these talks from people like Jamie... all I can picture is Paul Krugman from 1998 saying "Internet's Economic Impact No Greater Than Fax Machine". Or to go further back in time - I see those poor souls in 1800s who thought that protesting and destroying few machines can stop steam engine.
So - you want your country to stop it's citizens from using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency... good luck with that (and good luck with getting people to comply long term). In the meantime other countries will use Bitcoin and destroy you. To me it truly is as if somebody came in 1985 and said: "OK, this Internet thing that's starting - let's not use it because then spies that infiltrated our country can use it to send data out whenever they want". Funny thing is there were countries like that... look where they are now.

It automatically deposits $$$ over ACH. Say:
 - Every Monday you send $70 to your GDAX account over ACH
 - It takes like 5 business days for that money to arrive and be 
shown in GDAX account
 - Money arrives now you put autobuy of $10 per day on Saturday
 - Another Monday - $70 ACH deposit
 - In the meantime app does $10 buys every day
 - Profit
That's pretty much how it has been working for me for past few months. Easiest money I've ever made in my life... only now saw that BTC went to $5K and is now back to $4.3K. Still crazy to think $4K is already new normal.
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:23:31
Veteran from 2009, eh? Seems you know all about remorse... I've also started with Dollar Cost Averaging because I just couldn't cope with stress. I see people freaking out about price going from $5000 to $4000... man, when I remember back when that drop was from $500 to $400.
And yeah - you got it - DCA is just put in however many dollars you don't need every day. One of the reasons why I created this app is exactly because I didn't want fees to pile up. Now I deposit once a week automatically and buy every day automatically.
So you are welcome to use **this guys app** to do the same ;). So that when in future you purchase LTC it's averaged over few weeks and you don't get depressed that you've bought at $90 and now it's at $60.

Less stress and more profit. If you are professional trader (you have enough money to daily trade or someone is paying you to do it) - sure try to do it. But otherwise DCA and do something productive with your day. If you don't you'll kill yourself and likely make less profit in the long run.

@_date: 2017-09-04 21:57:19
Honestly, if you are not VERY technical, I would just stick to Bitcoin. Maybe Litecoin... Etherum if you are feeling REALLY adventurous. Everything else - forget it - it's pegged to BTC anyway... and now that Segwit is live I doubt any currency will overtake BTC.
Simply it's network effect - all virtual currencies that are starting now are like startups that want to go from 0 users and overtake Facebook. It just doesn't work like that. It'll take another paradigm shift for something to overtake Bitcoin. And those things don't happen on public offerings.
So - my advice is again - just set Bitcoin autobuy and forget it. In 10-20 years you'll at least have 10x money. Compare that to 7% in stock market and you'll see it's great. Hell, when I was writing in Dec 2016 that I'm autobuying BTC if someone told me it'll be 5x already - I wouldn't believe it. So, who knows... in 10-20 it may be 50-100x and at that point it's life changing money... retirement on $10K investment ;)
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:04:14
Awesome to hear! ;) 
That's actually one of the reasons why I wrote it - wanted to get in touch with like minded people. So, if you are fellow coder and want to collaborate - let me know. But at this point you should be able to use utility as-is... it's been working for me on my laptop last few months with no hiccups.
And with GDax I love that it's almost 0% fee when you set everything up... and you can even buy hourly.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:47:04
That's exactly what I was doing 3-4 years back. Wait for that big dip. In hindsight it's funny really - $43 to $37.5... and I wait for it to get to $30. When you get tired of it just switch to DCA and enjoy the ride.
Especially since I see BTC now bounced back to $3900+... I mean who knows... maybe in hour it goes again below $3700... but you'll find yourself needed to do something productive with your day than watch BTC price ;)
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:17:48
What says + I found Jamie's statement amusing because it seems like it never crossed his mind that huge majority of population in North Korea is like... starving. 90% people there can't get basic life's necessities, let a alone smartphone / computer that connects to the Internet.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:54:12
If you are on GDax, look through my post history - I've open sourced utility I've coded for myself for autobuys. Saved me so much time last few months and kept me away from all this daily stress ;)
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:17:47
If somebody told me BTC will go from $1000 in January to $4900 in August I would've thought - you're mad bro. But here it is.
If we see another big drop like in 2013 -&gt; 2014... that would be quite cool for people like me who are reloading steadily.
On this daily volatility: 13% daily change just shows how early we are in this journey. I actually love to see there is so much active interest in Bitcoin (and virtual currencies) that JP Morgan CEO saying something (stupid) can have such significant impact. Everybody scrambling to sell, to buy... and in a day we have like ~$10 BILLION change of market cap, ~$2.2 BILLION volume... madness. It's even crazier if you include other virtual currencies. It gets me thinking - man, how many people nowadays LIVE just to trade bitcoin daily.
In the long run however I see this as "buzz tax". Underlying bitcoin technology was same today as it was yesterday. And if one guy saying something gets you to value BTC and idea behind it 13% cheaper today than you did yesterday - me and other buyers will gladly take that value from you and other sellers in the system - thank you very much.

^ underrated comment
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:12:45
One thing that I find amusing with lots of "sell" threads is that people don't take into account tax implications. Like if I've bought at $2000 and it hits $3000 - it still makes no sense for me to sell for $1000 profit because of taxes. And let's not even get into how you are declaring and filing those gains on tax returns...
It's much better that BTC price goes down so that I can buy more BTC.
I've been upset about all the FUD going on lately... but as someone said "continue with madness... it allows me to buy cheaper BTC". So... keep it up...
EDIT: To all of you saying that I should invest my time and effort into dodging tax man for 4 digit gain... lol. Just lol. Let me keep it at that.
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:22:23
I too am tired of people that go "if you do X now then in the future you'll always need to do X". Segwit is fine. Segwit2X is not perfect, but it's way better than the alternative (chain split).
FUD in this sub lately is as crazy as that first proposal by Gavin to go from 1MB -&gt; 20MB blocks.

Alternatively just give only Trade permission on API key... that will allow app to only execute buys at intervals you set. Then you can manually deposit and withdraw. And of course, I'm here to answer any questions.
