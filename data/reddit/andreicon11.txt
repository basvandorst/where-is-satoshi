But then who would care about their price in BTC?
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:27:55
I understand how they currently work, I just don't like it.
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:02:05
Yes, do that. And while you're at it you should pay the industry average of rich cities like ny, SF, London. Otherwise you're just taking advantage of them.
How the fuck is everyone getting this comment wrong? I meant you should pay what you pay someone in your country, I didn't mean I feel like they (Venezuelans) are taking *my* projects.
If you pay a remote worker two cents a day because "he can afford to live on whatever I pay him" you're an idiot and an ass.
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:02:29
It doesn't seem free if they can't leave Venezuela as they please. I could move to a different country and earn more doing the same thing. That doesn't feel right, I kinda feel discriminated on the basis that my compatriots are stupid.

I thought about that myself, but there's a larger story behind what I said. I'd love to share, but this might not be the right sub.
@_date: 2019-03-29 06:19:24
I just meant you should not assume it's okay to hire them for peanuts. They need all the help they can get, but if you hire a man for a project you should pay him good, regardless of whether he can survive on way less.
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:23:54
I usually ask $30 / hr. What's really shitty is that although BTC is a global we still take the workers' country of residence into consideration when negotiating wages, even if we would pay BTC.

But then 


@_date: 2019-04-22 21:34:43


You do realize that you're talking about technology that hasn't been developed yet, right? Also cheap gold means cheaper electronics, easier Bitcoin mining, so it would definitely have an effect on Bitcoin price. The use of the word "unexpectedly" in this context is uninspired at best.

@_date: 2019-04-22 16:14:49
Gold is a finite resource as well, we just haven't determined the entire supply yet. New Bitcoin still can and is being mined we just know it'll be 21 millions of them.
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:23:02
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:37:11
It depends on how much you can recover from an initial amount of ore. If you can do double or triple the yield it might be feasible.

Are You talking about gold or Bitcoin dude?

How often would he have had to create new addresses by hand before bip32 was implemented?
I'm skeptical about this. I would've bought it if there were only one address with millions of BTC, but I don't think he threw addresses away after each block.
@_date: 2019-04-13 14:43:22
I seriously did not know this. I know he advised against address reuse since the beginning, but I didn't know it would generate a new mining address every block. I'm talking "setgenerate 1" and leaving the client, not manually clicking "receive"
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:35:16
Well it is for now, since we haven't started mining asteroids. Gold will still hold its value until we start.

No, I agree with him and it's actually true. That is what a banking license gives you, the right to print money and then destroy it as it's recovered from the market. Central banks delegate the job for private sector finance and only step in when we overdo it.

So are counterfeit bills if they're good. Life as we live it is also a big fat finger in our faces but we don't complain because it's hard to pinpoint exactly the source of all our troubles. I say it's procrastination and maybe greed.
