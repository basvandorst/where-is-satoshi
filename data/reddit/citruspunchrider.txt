Hmmm there are possibilities then, but it would need to be more global and reacheable for the common people (not internet people) for those benefits to be present. I still feel wary of bitcoin but thanks for answering my doubts.

According to what I have searched at the moment coins seem to be easier to get in U.S.A. or Europe. I'm in Central America and I'm cautious with meeting with people and trading with cash and I'm unable to find some service that let's me do withdrawal and deposits. (well I have less than a day searching so I might have missed something)
I think I'll search more later.

Hi I come from that news and I'm really trying to undersand this. I mean how can people really get that much money from buying so little in bitcoins? And is bitcoin really that good as a currency, I read that a lot of people lost money because their disk got formatted or their data got lost.

But in this case if it works like money isn't it weird that it's value changes a lot and in some ways unfair that because you started the "game" late you will exchange far less coins for the same money? Maybe I'm seeing it in the wrong way. I'm not sure.

I think I might invest a bit. (Now to search how to do that from my country...I hope it's possible)

Ok, now that I read a bit more I think I'm getting it a bit more. 
So this isn't like some worldchanging stuff that will improve everyone's life but more similar to the discovery of the New World and how people traveled taking risks and reaped benefits for being first. So it's like sailing across the web to the Intermericas.
