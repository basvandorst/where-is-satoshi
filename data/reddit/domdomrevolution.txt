They shut down the FUDDRUCKERS by my house. Thanks for reminding me and making me sad.

Would they be able to crash it?

Allentown, Pa? Represent! It's glad to see bitcoin seeing used back home.

Let me run a GUI interface really quick.

I honestly can't see it going much higher than $350 in the short term. I think it will rise past that eventually, but I think for right now we will see a price around $345 before correcting to anywhere from $150-$200 per BTC.

That's a great point. I'm still new and learning. I didn't even think of the Chinese market. I followed the last bubble and now that I was able to purchase a very small amount, I'm watching this price raise even closer. I think you're right though. With the Chinese and the new comers who just heard about bitcoin in stories like that guy from Norway, I think 175-200 is a more realistic correction.

How hard?

I would never buy more than I can afford to lose. I've been looking up on it since April. I wanted to buy at around 50 dollars, but as a college kid I couldn't even afford that. I worked all summer and now have a little extra money to play around. I'm very curious to this whole bitcoin thing.

Am I too late?
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:04:26
Is it worth getting into this late? I want to buy some but I don't know if its worth getting into.

Makes a lot of sense. Not something I'd use it for. I'm a little iffy on linking my bank account though to buy them.

He doesn't really say anything though. It's all still speculation.

Claim it. After 21 days it cancels.

What's that?
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:40:03
Just be careful who you give it to. Some people might not like that. I'm aware it's a gift, but that doesn't mean there aren't some people who will be (Unjustifiably) angry about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:52:12
It's looking like it will hit 300 by dawn. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:47:59
That'll still run you about 35k here in pa.
