Thanks, will that issue be mitigated on non-Windows computers?

OK ignore VPN, what about the other stuff I mentioned? Appreciate your insight.
@_date: 2019-07-13 05:45:14
Also, risk of what exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:28:45
Good forecast analysis. And how would BTC be affected in this scenario?
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:34:00
Thanks. Didn't he say though that statistical analysis can still deanonymize?
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:08:25
If it's only used as a secondary wallet and I have tons of antivirus/antimalware software guarding it, and use a VPN, will that help?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:26:03
Well, let's ignore the author for a moment and see if we can connect the dots on our own.... so the question becomes, are these dots valid and connectable?
@_date: 2019-07-22 03:31:14
So what's the verdict, Wasabi good or no?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:00
So what do you predict the net long-term effect to be?
@_date: 2019-07-13 06:15:01
It's not spelled "sceptical" but "skeptical".
If it were spelled "sceptical" it would be pronounced "septical".

@_date: 2017-12-17 00:00:53
"it's" always means "it is". ALWAYS.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:47:02
Hmm... who has the most say in protocol development?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:27:11
Is this what has been happening and does it still hold true? Can u share one or several articles that support this? I'm curious to dig deeper.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:14:08
Your sentence should have been : "Guy explains buying Bitcoin in a way I can finally understand.".
The "it" is not needed because "buying Bitcoin" is already the subject in your sentence. The "it" is redundant.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:59:00
Not sure we can predict anything in terms of macroeconomics. But we can guess at what strategies might be attempted to take down BTC. Best to be prepared for what might come.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:10:07
Urm am I missing something here? I thought the whole point of crypto is the anonymity?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:58:38
Yes, "concerned about its network". No problem sir, thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:30:24
Not much detail here but it hints at the direction and possibility :
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:57:41
Yes those are good scenarios, I agree. What he's saying though is people get a taste of Bitcoin but then there's a false-flag that makes Bitcoin look bad, an diverts people to a state-sanctioned crypto that is more controlled than any existing fiat. The gov will be able to see all your transactions, how much and to whom. Do you think this will happen?
@_date: 2019-07-13 05:40:53
Even with another OS, would you build it yourself from source?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:41
Granted. But in this case let's treat it as an academic exercise, let's not shoot the messenger. I can see this scenario playing out, but I think he's wrong that the masses will flock to the gov-sanctioned crypto and ditch Bitcoin. My take is that worst-case, they might do that for maybe enough years to realize that it's even more restrictive of a currency than anything else they've seen in the past, and by then Bitcoin would still be around for people to want to move (back) to it. So... HODling will still survive -- that's my take -- or is that too optimistic?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:26
No idea, I only know that Bitcoin was designed to be un-bannable by any party. So they can try to ban it but we can only guess at the effects...
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:56:31
Right. Open, transparent, searchable, but still anonymous. No?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:46:25
Not sure what you mean, is that a trick question to which you have the answer?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:28:07
Look here : 
They want to dominate mining. To dominate means to be able to influence. So here's one sign of things to come... right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:15:31
OK good stuff, so maybe we are in the clear after all and will just have to keep HODling out...
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:44:56
Good point re: futures. Other than Zero Hedge's public image though... do you think Russia and China could undermine Bitcoin with those described strategies, or is that too pie-in-the-sky?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:52:38
I don't disagree. How exactly though?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:01:57
If not these, are there any other real long-term threats to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:49:53
I believe someone can fit all that criteria you mentioned and still speak truth, or even partial truth. I'm interested in long-term strategies that might be played out against Bitcoin, so his theory is worth investigating and discussing. I think it would be silly to just dismiss what someone is saying outright purely based on "reputation" alone. Let's ignore "reputation" for a moment and look at the points outlined above -- can you find the fatal flaw?
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:45:31
"Overhyped" is one word. Why do people always get this wrong? "Over" is a prefix, not an adjective.
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:49:51
OK I just saw this... but the question is could there be any component that's hidden from this documentation and do we have any way of knowing/mitigating it?
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:38:48
Meltdown, Spectre... are these Chinese too?
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:43:12
OK playing devil's advocate here regarding Trezor. The software might be open-source but what if there's a hidden component to the hardware? Beyond a hidden "brain" in the CPU, what if it actually has hidden wifi capability too for the hidden brain to use? Anyone with news or insider facts on why this would not be a probable scenario? Any hard evidence?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:52:09
"It's" always means "it is". Always.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:14:53
"It's" always means "it is". Always.
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:11:37
Fun fact : "it's" always means "it is".
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:54:29
In this case it should be "set up" as 2 separate words. "Setup" is joined only if used as an adjective or noun. It would be funny if you asked "How do I fireup this engine" or "How do I wakeup in the morning", for instance.
