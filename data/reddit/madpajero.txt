Don't get too bothered by the down votes, unless some one who is willing to point out their rebuttal to your posting, you shouldn't be too concern about it. Gave you an upvote for answering the thread properly.

Sorry to hear that, I hope the best for you in your job searching.

I can't recall the term they used but what companies does is that they add extra to the exchange rate as an insurance. 
For instance 1 USD is to 6.20 Chinese Yuan at this moment, factories in China would use 1 USD to 5.58 Chinese Yuan exchange rate (an insurance of 10%) when quoting their price to foreign customer. If there is a decline in Chinese Yuan, they wouldn't make a loss/big losses as they have 10% extra.

Even though it is only for one time payment but it is still a good move nonetheless. 
Hopefully Reddit would publish their data on bitcoin transaction to show how effective is it to accept bitcoin.

Have a look at what others are doing, maybe you can form your own ideas with it.

Yea, in my head I go, are you seriously requesting for these amount of information for verification? The type of personal information some exchanges request for are unreasonable. They are good ways to prevent fraud and there are bad ways to prevent fraud, asking for my monthly payslip is a bad way. 
After meddling around with some exchanges, I finally found localbitcoins to be a secure yet easy method to purchase bitcoin. The two step verification for login and to transfer bitcoin seems to be quite reasonable.
Edit: worded it better.

You're right in a way, at this moment unless you're interested in bitcoin (politics, economy, social and/or technology), an average joe will just find bitcoin a burden.
Honestly I just started using bitcoin, the one good thing I feel that is easier on bitcoin than conventional method is to transfer funds, especially international funds transfer. It is really effortless and dirt cheap compared to what PayPal, banks and other financial institution are charging.

Thanks a heap, will pay it forward on your behalf!

Didn't cross my mind about the AML and KYC laws, thanks for pointing that out.

A US citizen is subject to world wide income tax, regardless of is his location. Under Bank Secrecy Act, you're required to report annually on any foreign financial account. 
You have US PATRIOT Act, RICO, Financial Anti-Terrorism Act, and others.  Based on the past record, I would say they can. How effective it can be would be another discussion.

Is it a discount? Are their bitcoin charges fixed or it follows the fluctuation of bitcoin?
Edit: Sorry, I just saw your reply about the discount on FAQ.

They are a bitcoin address shortener

Seriously, you called that a "big" reason? How do you think paypal's initial user base was? Or amazon, ebay, uber, and what not? This is not a reason, this is just plain lazy writing. 
Unless more government starts banning crypto-currencies, or else Bitcoin will be gaining momentum. The female population will be spending more on bitcoin compared to the male (eventually) but they wouldn't know that they're using bitcoin.
Edit: Added the word eventually

I haven't experienced receiving from changetip before, would like to know how it works. thanks

A person who desires to do so or a person who is leveraging on others could consider himself as a hoarder. To me this is just an economic term, I see it in a neutral form just as these words hedge fund managers, day traders, rare coin collectors and others.
Hmm, maybe you will be interested in this [article](

What makes you think that when the government wouldn't set regulations like these on bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-09 09:42:35
What you're thinking here is the general definition of ["Hoard" Mirriam Webster](
The term hoard in their context is a jargon from the investment industry, ["Hoarding" Investopia](
Whether they're effectively hoarding or not is a separate matter but it is what they think they're doing.

Have you tried localbitcoins.com? I purchase my bitcoins from there, kinda like the set up.
