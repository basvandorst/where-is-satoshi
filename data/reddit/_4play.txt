Point  On a hardfork, users will migrate to the coin with the lowest fees and fastest processing times. Antpool miners can trade bitcoins with itself, meanwhile everyone else can go back to using graphics card miner rigs and trade with users. Guess which one will be worth more? That'll be a big FU to BU and Mr Jihan Wu. Thank you.

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand miners, maybe more
People selling without thinking
People mining without segwitting
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of selling
"Fools" said I
"You do not know, selling like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent bitcoins fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said
"The words of Satoshi are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence

Can I prove it? Absolutely not.
I just read some info on some site I have no idea if its true I'm not a programmer I'm just a guy trying to figure out where things are headed. This is what it said:
SegWit is a protocol designed to address the issue of bitcoin scalability. The idea is to separate the signature field of a bitcoin transaction from the transaction itself, and move it to a Merkle tree. This will make the transaction appear smaller, creating more space in each block and boosting the bitcoin network’s capacity.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:05:17


If data transferred quadruples, but tx fees don't increase along with it (I read that fees could be up to 75% less than current), then won't the miners cost go up along with the more transactions there are? I mean maybe by a negligible amount initially but if it does not scale properly then the miners are screwed as the network grows bigger. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:56:10
Segwit by design has smaller transaction sizes lower fees and fast confirmation times, regardless of hashing power, but the difference is it scales better than BU, which is better for bitcoin in the long run. BU's design is for unlimited sized blocks making it harder for smaller miners to contribute hash power into the network, making it easier for only the top mining pools and manufacturers to earn more transaction fees. BU is basically centralization, and jihan wu said it best himself something along the lines of "you can't blame me for wanting to make more money". That's my understanding of it so far, correct me if I'm wrong. Basically, with BU miners can allow the transaction fees to become "unlimited" whereas segwit by design limits these precious transaction fees. This is why users will flock to the segwit chain when given the two options, segwit is more scalable.

I see what you're getting at: anything could happen. It is exciting and dangerous at the same time, such country could be subject to the same treatment Libya and Iraq received for their decision to switch from the petro-dollar to the gold standard. Big banks would not like it and suddenly big countries find a reason to invade or impose sanctions on that country. But like I said bitcoin is recognized, and is literally recognized legally, as an asset than a currency, that's the key difference. It's too volatile and payment speeds take too long to be used as a currency. It's not issued by a bank according to inflation rates, like a currency. It can't ever take on a physical paper or metallic form, like a currency. Your bitcoins are simply a spot on a really big ledger known as the blockchain. That's what's so weird about bitcoin, the name implies it's a currency, but it's not!

Nothing. If you're depositing bitcoin into a bank account to be converted into the local currency, it will act like any other payment medium just like checks. If you deposit bitcoin into your bank account to be kept as bitcoin, well, there's no point because if you have a wallet that is basically a bank account already. 
Bitcoin is being recognized as an asset, not a currency. It's like giving someone gold as payment. On the same note, back in the day, settlers in america used guns and alcohol as payment. That was the bitcoin of its time. As a matter of fact, that still is the bitcoin of rednecks today!

There is no end in sight. No progress has been made. it doesn't matter if BU will succeed or not, in this current state the miners are profiting so much from excessive fees. Apps struggle to sell for just 1 dollar, now the minimum btc transaction IS that. just to move wallets. with confirmation times in the hours for some. payment processor companies are switching to altcoins. it's surprising to see btc is currently near its all time high price. what conclusions would you draw from this? sell

What if there were no miner fees, the block reward is the only miner incentive, increase in volume of transactions increases the difficulty factor, block reward scales down and stops at a minimum level and total supply of bitcoins is unlimited, but the rate at which bitcoins can be produced scales down. 
Bitcoin would still remains scarce, so long as supply does not exceed growth. There are 8 billion people with a gajillion amount of dollars in currency with new people being born every day, as long as supply doesn't exceed that it could work.

Here is a guide that utilizes bitaddress.org to allow you to make several types of secure passwords: password based and also paper wallets.
If you go with paper wallets, put it in a fire-proof safe, but if you lose the paper wallet in any way the bitcoins are lost. You can go with a brain wallet, this is a good option, but if you lose your memory and don't have it written down somewhere you lose the bitcoins forever.

Whether you agree with me or not is irrelevant to the fact that banks are interested in blockchain technology for the main reason that it will be secured with an extremely large amount of computing power. You are completely right in that it is trivial to do a double spend attack if you have the computing power. The last hack was orchestrated by North Korea and yielded a sum of 81 million USD ( A bank could easily spend 100 million USD as a one time investment to make a blockchain. So if you want to control their network, you'd need to spend more than 100 million to get what.. another 100 million and break even? How are you going to hide 100 million dollars worth of hardware? The point is, nothing is unhackable, but everything has it's price. And when the price exceeds the reward, what's the point?

Without sounding too technical, here's what would happen:
A bunch of people don't pay their loans back, instead they put their money into the bitcoinX rocketship and fly to the moon. On their way, from space, they look back at earth and think "man... look at that pale blue planet, and all the debt we left behind on it" and then land on the moon, play low-gravity golf using the moon craters as the holes. You'd think it'd be easy to get a golf ball into a 4 mile wide crater, except it's actually harder in low-gravity as the golf balls tend to remain in orbit if driven hard enough. 
These are just the facts.

Bitcoin is not for everyone, but it has its place as a store of value and mode of payment for tech savvy individuals. Susan in accounting will never get it. She also doesn't get stocks so she throws her savings into mutual funds. When you die your coins die witj you but the whole botcoin market grows a little bit. I view bitcoin in the realistic way you do, and I think much of your frustration is due to trying to see btc as a currency, when it's not. It's an asset that happens to be spendable, aka a commodity. A lot of people on this reddit don't realize this, they think of currency because the name is called bitCOIN and there's pictures of coins, when really there is no coin, it's all just entries in a ledger. 
Segwit has the potential to change bitcoins properties into more currency-like which will increase the market cap as existing bitcoin users won't have to convert to cash as often, since segwit allows btc to be used more coveniently as payment.

There is no timeline for activating segwit. Jihan and the mining community are making a killing off transaction fees alone. It is economically feasible to spam the mempool at this point. Every day of this stalemate that passes is a big win for Jihan and the miners who do not support segwit.

When most people think of market manipulation, they think the price goes up and down. Unless you're the owner of a market and plan to steal (mt.gox) you cannot manipulate the market efficiently enough to benefit you. 
Real market manipulation that happens on a daily basis works by creating large bid or ask orders, so when traders look at the order book as an indicator, they think things like "hey at a +/-
3% of the price there is 3 times as many sell orders than buy orders!" this looks like the price will go down, but really a whale has a bot that put up all these sell orders that will be pulled immediately when you try to buy. 
This isn't a big deal if you're bearish, it's more for whales to profit off the day trader bulls.

Switching petrodollars to gold for trading oil is reason enough for invasion. US has to set a precedent to prevent any country from switching their standard for trading oil to gold from american dollars. Read up on the petrodollar, its interesting.
Bitcoins in a novelty coin, or any other type of wallet, is still much different. If you gave me a metal novelty bitcoin, I don't have 100% trust that you didn't copy down the private key on the back of that coin and will later spend the funds behind my back. With actual currency, you can't do that. If you gave me a dollar bill I know can't spend it without my consent unless you physically have it. 
So do you get how bitcoin is an asset? It's kind of like how land is an asset. Someone can own it, but you can transfer the ownership down on paper. You don't pick up this piece of land and give it to someone. If you could, then it would be a currency.

I'm not disagreeing with you, but the point I'm trying to make is that bitcoin is losing its relevance as a (trigger alert) cryptocurrency. Let's break things down a bit: the word cryptocurrency implies it is to be used like a currency, not an asset. Right now it's moving further away from currency-like features. It should be known as a cryptoasset.
My second point is bitcoin is reaching a stage where it must evolve to stay relevant and continue growing. For example, BlackBerry used to dominate the cell phone industry. I remember when a lot of my friends had one, and I was a big fat weirdo for having a phone with only 1 button and a large screen. BlackBerry, Nokia, Motorola, they all have one thing in common: they failed to evolve to stay ahead of the game. And the facts are, right now, there's no clear indication bitcoin is gaining any progress towards solving the scaling debate. Everyone is speculating, but until that piece of news comes out that says BIP coming out on X date, until we see that, bitcoin isn't changing. And in this world if you don't evolve you die.
Last point, China controls an astronomical percentage of bitcoins market cap. But if you look at how market volume is moving across the markets, you'll see a slow but steady trend of chinese renminbi into other altcoins. That is the leak in the titanic. I'm not saying bitcoin is doomed, I'm just saying that if this problem isn't fixed, bitcoin will go the way of the nokia/motorola/blackberry. It will exist but be a very small nostalgic memory of the past. Who can prove me wrong with some facts that bitcoin will patch up the scaling issue by X date?
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:05:56


You're right, my bad. We are making lots of headway with the scaling debate, lots of progress we are months away from an update to the code and its smooth sailing. Tens of thousands of users with $5-$10 locked up in a wallet to high tx fees get their money back, tx fees stop growing, all is well. MY BAD YOURE RIGHT

Banks everywhere use ledgers to keep track of accounts and their funds. Banks communicate these ledgers with each other on a network. The network is protected with encryption, but encryption alone is not enough to stop hackers. Sometimes hackers can hack these networks and make changes to the ledgers, changes like moving funds into their own bank accounts and then withdrawing the cash. 
The blockchain is a similar type of network, but it's secured with computing power. A lot of computing power is used in bitcoins blockchain system, and to hack the bitcoin blockchain you would need to invest a good fortune into producing the computing power necessary to take control of the network. 
Big banks would like to copy this system, to make it so that in order to hack their network, the hacker would need to invest a fortune to make it happen. By this point, if you have the money to hack such a network, you probably should be focusing on returning Elon Musk's calls about your last trip to the moon.

There is a 2nd chance for a bitcoin etf and the review for that is happening May 15th. This piece of news was brought to my attention shortly before the price increase began. I think what we have is a combination of factors. If you recall bitfinex wells fargo issue dropped the price, and any time a market has issues the price drops. The USD holders of bitfinex arent limited to bitcoin they can withdraw in other currencies and even altcoins, so I'm not so sure that piece of news is a major contributing factor as opposed to the ETF round 2.
