We do an ICO ad about once per quarter for a carefully vetted project in the ecosystem. Not everyone who has Blockfolio will see it. We are not always able to advertise to all countries. This is our primary source of revenue.

We're pretty unclear why you think we steal data. Did you read this somewhere? Did you have a question about how the data is used?

If you divide your Total BTC by 3000, you should get the trade price per unit of XVG. You can also look at the historical trade price of BTC on CMC if you're curious.

We would like to clarify on what we do with user data. 
"Stealing" implies that we're somehow holding your data hostage or taking it away from you, which we don't. The data is stored anonymously on our servers and is associated only with your Token ID (which you can find under settings). This is particularly useful to know in case you are worried about 3rd party audits or just your privacy in general.  
We DO use your data when we feel it's beneficial for you, the end user. 
We DO NOT sell your data or distribute it to 3rd party affiliates. You own your data.

This was a bad incident but a great reason for businesses to start accepting cryptocurrency as alternate forms of payment in the very least. While the crypto world has a lot of obstacles to overcome, setting up an extra payment channel isn't hard or risky, and companies should hop on the bandwagon to give people more choices.

It's quite the opposite actually. We started enforcing authentication in the app to prevent any third party apps from using our service or taking data. This precaution is why it's imperative to update and why your app will no longer work until you do.

One of the best stories we've ever heard. Keep it up, and thank you!

The main portfolio graph does show total change rather than profit/loss- which we agree needs to be added to the app as an additional option. We went through a lot of upgrades to infrastructure over the last 6 months and are finally at the point where our developers can focus on big improvements like adding cumulative profit/loss. 
Cost averaging could be added to the holdings tab, we'll keep that in mind as we lay out our plans for the redesign. Appreciate your input on both features.

Any specific feature that you are looking for in your tracker? We always appreciate feedback.

This is a feature that will be available on Blockfolio in the future. If there are specific functions or requirements you have, please do leave us feedback. We hope to make the app optimal for as many users as possible in the future.
