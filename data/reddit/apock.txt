This is awesome! How hard was it to setup?

This is actually awesome for someone looking to allow bitcoin payments in their store, it skips any work to be done by the cashier, the costumer just touches the tag and transfers the money.

"But what if I lose my time and investment if bitcoin doesn't go mainstream?" - Doesn't matter, you can do anything!!

You missed the point, he asked for 5$ over the price, therefore I asked 5$ under. And as you can see, he didn't like my offer either..

Obvious marketing is obvious.

I'll buy the coin for 15$.

Fuck, why is this KVM? I've been looking for a service like this for a long time at these prices, the only shitty aspect of backupsy is being KVM virtualization, if it was xen, even for a couple bucks more, I'd get it right now.

I live in -----, abd while on the last few weeks a good couple of services merged that allow us to easily buy bitcoins (although they still take 10% commission, at least it's really easy to buy them), do you realize how cool it would be to buy bitcoins directly with your bank account?
All coinbase has to do is go international and pretty much every other service is done.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:24:48
Yeah, they should implement it on the bitcoin official client.
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:27:44
Too bad any useful website for purchasing bitcoins ignores the rest of the world on some way or another.
@_date: 2013-03-05 12:06:23
This was a seriously awesome initiative, thanks for doing this!

Worst use of any kind of money ever.

You know what's anoying? Websites that accept bitcoin donations never show a simple QR code next to the bitcoin address.
I use blockchain as my wallet, what do you think is easier for me? Go to the website, input my login details, wait for the SMS code, input the code, login, go to send money, copy paste the bitcoin address, input amount and then send it, or simply pull out my phone, input an amount, scan a qr and hit send?

It's open-source, do it yourself.
