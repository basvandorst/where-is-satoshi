Only if you give 10 back

I’m sure there will be more energy efficient ways to mine in the future countervailing the demand effect.

Why not both? ^^

If you want a great technical understanding. An undergraduate level of probability math and basic computers is required to understand this book. The best out there in explaining Cryptocurrencies:

It means the blockchain can’t handle the number of transactions being made. It suggests (not necessarily an indicator but a pretty good measure) that the blockchain is not as valuable as the level of usage. That means the price and usage levels are above the value of the blockchain.
In another analogy, if Amazon can only handle 1 billion packages a day and 2 billion packages are being demanded by customers, Amazon’s operational capabilities are below demand.

Good point. Yes, more hash power would be a temporary solution. Block technicals such as batching, fitting more transactions, or off-chain solutions might be better.
However, more hash power means more mining = more and faster confirmations. So transactions would get their 6 confs much quicker.
While the hash power fix might not work for Bitcoin, I think it works better for Ethereum given its adjustment every block (13 seconds). Now the number of transactions in each Ethereum block is complex due to the diversity of eth transactions.

This is the part where we just ‘Smile and wave boys, smile and wave’

Yes. More hashing power is needed or a more scalable solution (maybe off-chain or Segwit, which batches transactions). This applies to only mineable cryptos like BTC/ETH/XMR and not non-mineable like XRP/XLM

Those are rookie numbers. Got to pump it up

While Bitcoin is awesome, it’s price can only hit moon levels when the least technologically adept people can transact it very easily
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:15:03
Without Bitcoin, there’s no ‘Bitcoin’ is awesome. It makes sense on a deep level.

It can’t be a good reserve without efficient and simplified transactions for even very smart people at banks. The tech currently is complex and most people adept at it are generally the youngsters. I think 300K is possible but that’s ways to go.
