 Define long run. 6-12 months? We'll be fine. Next few weeks to months, expect us to chop around in the $400s and $500s. Bitfinex was the largest US exchange by volume. 
I take this as a long term net positive though honestly. It was only a matter of time, people need to stop putting so much faith in exchanges, ESPECIALLY one's with little to no regulation and oversight. 
It is my hope that the regulators look at this and see it as a call to action for approving more legitimate US on ramps into trading bitcoin. It's become obvious that traders will trade bitcoin where there is the highest liquidity available, regardless of risk. Let's approve this fucking ETF and put the days of the amateur exchanges a la Mt Gox behind us.

It's absurd how you think that anyone was SERIOUSLY considering a rollback or HF in the first place. This isn't Ethereum (and that ordeal just goes to show what a shit-show decisions like that can become).

@_date: 2016-04-24 16:43:12
I agree with your sentiment partially, but you have to acknowledge that had it not been for the meteoric rise throughout 2013 a lot of the development that we are just now seeing come to fruition would not have taken place. After 2013 we saw a serious uptick in adoption, VC investment, financial industry acknowledgement/research, and developer activity in the bitcoin ecosystem. Things in life are rarely as black and white as "this was either good or bad for x" so many things factor in. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:47:42
There's only one blockchain right now that has any **true** real world use right now. Sooner or later those doing all this "research" will come to realize that. A network is only as valuable as it's number of active users.
 It's intranet vs Internet all over again. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 21:59:23
Dude that's awesome, makes it that much cooler!

@_date: 2016-04-24 23:21:40
The fact that bitcoin is finite and does not have a central point of authority are not ideological.. They are fact, and they most certainly are a large part of the reason for why Bitcoin has the value that it does right now. Did you misunderstand my comment? I agree with your other points though, they are all pieces of the pie that make crypto superior to fiat. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 04:46:05
Can't fool me sonny! ;) 
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:47:32
Well said. Gives me an idea for an off the cuff parody video where someone walks into their bank, states that they want to withdraw all of their money and hands the teller a USB stick and tells them that they can just place it on there. This someone being Paul Krugman of course lol
@_date: 2016-04-06 17:11:57
Is there any shred of credibility to this guy's claims? I wouldn't think so, why all the smoke and mirrors when all he has to do is make a transaction or sign something using a known key associated with Satoshis bitcoins. 
After all this time this seems like the least graceful way for 'Satoshi' to come out into the light.. Just saying 
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:00:56
I probably wont make this video honestly, but I would certainly watch it! The idea is out there for anyone to steal it they think its worth their time :)
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:36:55
Well, coming from someone who rode out the litecoin halvening 'bubble', that peaked and popped all about a month or two before the actual event, I don't know if that's likely. I would expect bitcoin to play out a little differently, but wouldn't be surprised if a similar scenario took place.
@_date: 2016-04-25 03:46:31
"what most people sit around thinking about" has fuck all to do with what gives something value. And this entire comment thread was originally directed at Paul Krugmans comments, whom I think we can both agree does not fit the definition of "most people" 
@_date: 2016-04-19 16:57:51
So what does this mean in terms of actually seeing SegWit implemented live in Bitcoin? Realistically, how far off is that from becoming a reality?
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:54:26
Could make for an interesting week. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 04:00:58
Listen to everyone here, do NOT try to trade bitcoin for a profit. Period. Especially if you have no trading background. And even if you did, bitcoin is a different horse than any other market. Just buy and hold. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:14:25
Wow yea thanks for that clip, hadn't seen it before, Krugman seriously does not get it at all. Sure we already had 'digital money' of sorts, and credit card payments etc, but the key point he is missing with bitcoin is the finite aspect, as well as the lack of a central point of authority. Sure we already had digital systems in place for fiat currencies, but those do nothing to temper the fact that the monetary BASE of those currencies can be fucked with ad-infinitum. Which is funny because he even mentions the monetary base of the USD being at 4 trillion in his argument, unknowingly highlighting in his own critique one of the main parallels that bitcoin draws an advantage from in comparison! 
The market has already shown that there is a value to assets like Bitcoin. The more Krugman flaps his gums on the subject the more he damages his own legacy. Sad really, because he's not unintelligent, I just think he has blinders plastered on resulting from biases built up from his own life experiences. 
Edit: words 
@_date: 2016-04-26 00:27:30
From your earlier comment "most people don't sit around and think about what money is" and now you're contradicting yourself by stating the exact opposite..make up your mind. All I'm saying is if it weren't for its finite aspect, bitcoin would NOT be where it is today. End of story. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:02:42
So best case scenario from review onward, a month or so, give or take a week?
@_date: 2016-04-04 19:37:37
Given the other information it's highly doubtful. There is almost a 0 percent chance that this date is the TRUE birth date of whoever created bitcoin, their fervent pursuit of anonymity would indicate as much. Given this, this date was likely selected and given for a reason. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:35:33
Which would indicate organic growth. Supply is drying up, miners are selling less, I would assume in anticipation of the halving. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:33:25
I got a card too, and plan on using it here and there, but really were still losing money with the fee to convert fiat to BTC. So while I'll do it to support bitcoin, there really isn't a reason for ppl who aren't bitcoin fan boys to use this as of now.. Hopefully that will change soon though! 
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:39:57
Will a VPN even do any good? Honestly?... 
@_date: 2015-12-12 04:20:25
There's a fee to buy bitcoin on coinbase. That's the conversion fee
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:54:04
Im already working on adding a node, count me in!
@_date: 2015-12-12 15:25:31
Dude... There's a fee.. When you BUY bitcoin on coinbase. 1%. That's the fee I'm referring to. So your still paying more for something than you would had you used your banks debit card
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:42:47
The world isn't as black and white as you make it out to be. Sure I agree with your points to an extent, but I guess I just grow more cynical as the years go by. I'm hopeful that transparent systems such as bitcoin will level the playing field however. 
The more autonomy in my eyes the better. Sure those in power are corrupt, but by its very nature, power (money in our case) IS the source of corruption. Almost no human is immune to it (Ghandi &amp; M. Theresa etc. excluded). Whether it be the Rockefellers, Bush's, Koch Bros etc. doesn't matter, you or those close to you would be just as self-interested as them if you were king of the hill and if you say otherwise your either in the extreme minority or lying to yourself.
What we need are universally transparent systems that force honesty upon those in power. Until that day comes, expect to live in an unjust world. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:27:16

I'm in the process of setting mine up now! If I followed the steps correctly, I'm surprised it's this easy to setup a full node. I'm on Windows 7, downloaded bitcoin core and it's syncing up with the network. Started at a little over six years and I'm already halfway caught up. I check and I'm allowing incoming connections to port 833 or whatever it was listed on the instructions. Is there anything else or am I good to go? I checked that bitnodes site and its showing my correct IP and everything 
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:18:20

Well, I don't know too much about the technicalities, and you have good points for everything, but I feel like your underestimating what the world might look like 10-20 years down the road. Following thoughts come to mind (in no particular order):
* Energy production could drastically improve with optimization of renewable sources (solar in particular). Especially as we transition to electric vehicles. A typical car engine only utilizes a third or less of the gasoline it burns. If/as we transition the primary energy production for transport to large scale power plants vs millions of inefficient internal combustion engines, we will have a non-negligible amount of that energy freed up to allocate elsewhere.
* Money is the lifeblood of the world, in so much as fueling global economies. This will not change. A more fluid means of transacting frictionlessly *might**(or might not) be worth the tradeoff in energy consumption, especially if it cuts cost/energy consumption elsewhere (costs of printing, moving, securing, resources needed to create physical currencies etc) and re-established trust in a world where traditional monetary systems are viewed with increasing skepticism. 
* Historically speaking, humans tend to not be overly concerned with finding the utmost in efficiency. For the most part, we seem content in settling with something if it functions reliably well (see nuclear industry, internal combustion engine etc)
* Mining might/could/may become more efficient in the future as computing technology evolves. Decentralization efforts like 21inc's ambitions plans might help as well. Piggybacking the system into many electronics might/could/may be a good idea.
* Or, all said and done you're right, in which case a more efficient spinoff of bitcoin or something very similar to it will come about. Doubt we would take a step backwards from decentralized trust based systems after seeing its tremendous potential.
Also, see points presented by and above
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:13:41
How many times can you be wrong on one day? ;) 
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:18:22
It's not an argument for the status quo. But not everything can be anarchy. There is a rhyme and reason to at least a few systems that have been implemented. If you want to focus on something, focus on something that actually needs change. Drug reform, police accountability, fiscal responsibility etc. etc. Of ALL the fucked up shit in the world, non this fairly lenient regulatory stance from NY towards bitcoin should not be your focus. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:23:41
I don't see an option to buy with bitcoin on movietickets.com for this movie though...

Yes, despite the complaining that is sure to come, this is regulation was inevitable and overwhelmingly positive
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:23:53
Except for the fact that your wrong. You like shit like Mt gox happening or all this bullshit with OkCoin? You think Bitcoin will ever be taken seriously if it doesn't have oversight? It's money, it needs have certain safety measures put into place so people don't get ripped off. Do you bitch about FDIC insuring your bank account? You want the bank to get robbed or have their systems hacked and ALL of your money to disappear?! 
Regardless of if it's right of wrong (regulation), that's the world you live in, not some Ayn Rand novel like whatever dream world you live in. Grow up and pull your head out of your ass. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:04:28

Thanks for the response, I'd be interested to hear coherent counterarguments as opposed to down votes for what you said. For a while now I had a feeling that legacy institutions were more interested in replicated bitcoins technology for their own means, as opposed to leveraging bitcoin itself. Granted I don't like that, but that's just the feeling I get.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:36:43

@_date: 2015-06-05 01:36:30
They could, but I'm pretty sure that currently the network behind bitcoin is massive. Like, orders of magnitude more computing power than Googles data centers for example (if I'm not mistaken). So while a powerful govt or company could create their own blockchain, I don't think it could compete with a free market blockchain.. But hey, what do I know 
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:35:42
Well, sadly that's the way the world works pizzaface, and your internet ranting wont change things. I'm not going to get into a pissing match with you, as it's apparent that you either have an agenda or have some serious issues. Either  way, judging by the comparative up/dwn votes from our brief conversation its fairly obvious who has the more rational point. Have a nice day

Wasnt the point of bitcoin to get rid of middle men from the beginning? And now your suggesting we scrap that idea because you can't envision a future where data storage has Increased from the point it is at today? Do me a favor, Google a picture of the first computer.

First, where is your proof of deaths related to SR purchases? The hits on record were fake if i recall correctly. Also, given two situations: buying drugs, weapons etc in person or remotely (online), which would you personally feel less safe doing? People could purchase all of these things before online marketplaces existed and they still can now without using the web. I (among many others) would argue that if anything Ross created a safer environment than what had existed before. Regardless however, going back to the main point you commented on, prohibition does NOT work in human society (if you want proof, attend history classes). There have been and will be ZERO exceptions to this, no matter how niche or secular, if someone wants something bad enough, they will get it, laws &amp; regulations make no difference to them. The sooner we collectively realize this and approach these problems differently the better.

Nobody has the answers you're looking for man, it's just as simple as that. The up-side potential is greater than the down-side in a approval/disapproval scenario. Take that as you will, but I'm long in both cases. Buying if it's approved, and buying the panic dip if it's denied.

It's still full of drama &amp; hype. I've had a blast being a bitcoiner every day since early 2013. It's an insane market, and possibly the best investment I'll ever make in my lifetime.

Unfortunately mining has moved on to ASICS. Special computers dedicated solely to the process of mining. The best way to invest a small amount of time/energy into bitcoin is to just buy a few bucks worth.

So your telling me that you don't think it would be more convenient if there was a universal means of exchange? After all, we live in an age where information is universal, as is commerce &amp; trade. Agree to disagree but personally I think not having to deal with currency exchange just serves to lessen economic friction. Time will tell 
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:00:36
Great, glad to see the ball finally starting to roll on this. So as far as Mike's Bitcoin-xt reference, we would be going with scaling block sizes rather than a one time bump to 20mb if I understand correctly? If so I'm definitely in favor of this. The less we have potential chances for hard forks the better, especially as time goes on (assuming the networks continued growth). 
@_date: 2016-03-13 02:40:41
Horrible analogy. Money Is a TOOL, transportation, food etc are SERVICES. If I buy a hammer I want it to be able to hammer every nail I find, and not have to switch over to a different hammer depending on where I'm at or what type of nail it is.. Same with money, I want it to be accepted wherever I go.. It's as simple as that. Just because 'competition is good' applies in some areas that doesn't mean you can run apply it as a golden rule to everything. It may not be bitcoin, I'm not arguing that, I'm simply saying that money is a tool and we would be better off with a universal money.
Take language for example, while not the perfect comparison, would you argue that "competition in languages" is better for the "consumer" of that language? I would argue that a universal language would be beneficial to society as a whole, as it would break down barriers that further racial and ethnic divides among us, and might well enhance our feelings of comraderie with those of different nationalities than our own.  (this is coming btw, Google "universal translators" for a rough timeframe) 
As I said before though, agree to disagree, I'm not here to convince you of anything.

Gotta admit, it was a very well orchestrated scam
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:58:54
This right here is why I just liquidated 95% of my long term holdings over the past 3 days. Really fucking bummed about it, but I need to manage risk and this scaling divide is nuts. I've held through thick &amp; thin and will jump at buying back (even if it's higher than I sold for) but ONLY once this is resolved and behind us. Until then I see things getting worse before they get better. 
Edit: The silver lining of wide scale selling could be to force the miners &amp; devs into a hasty compromise, one that would include both the optimizations of segwit and some kind of dynamic block size so that this never becomes a contentious issue again. That's what the optimist in me likes to think at least.
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:39:45
YES! This exactly. By refusing to give ground and compromise the core devs are doing a disservice to Bitcoin. No other way around it. Increase to 2mb is NOT cause to act as if the sky will fall should this happen.

Comment scores have been restored to this thread but no others.. Makes you wonder whose agenda this fits. I am genuinely starting to think that this is how 'they' fight bitcoin.. Subvert anyone they can, Hearne, theymos etc to spread FUD through the core of the community. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:39:32
THIS x100! I literally just transfered 1/2 of my cold storage holdings to an exchange to sell for fiat. It's time to hedge my bets and see how things play out. If I'm wrong I'll buy back in after the scaling debate has been successfully resolved. I haven't even considered divesting since I started this wild ride in 2013 so this is a pretty big decision for me. I know I'm not alone in my thinking either. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:18:05
After a year of arguing, failing to take action in any meaningful way will only lend validity to skeptics like Mike Hearne. 2mb is more than meeting the core devs halfway from Gavins original scaling proposals of 8mb and doubling from there every few years. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 03:25:14

The 'halvening' was basically a meme that was picked up by the bitcoin community. Similar to 'hodl' or 'hodling' in reference to holding. Or at least that has been my impression over the last few years.

@_date: 2016-06-06 04:09:50
Yea, as others will tell you, mining is no longer a viable option for the 'small fish'. Just buy a small amount of bitcoin (any $ amount you're okay with potentially losing) and experiment... Personally, I'd be buying now with any liquid

@_date: 2016-06-27 13:21:44
Lessening supply while demand remains constant (or increases). Basically 3600 bitcoins are created a day now, at current prices that's about $2.3 million each day. If price stays at 645 then after the halving it will be 1800 bitcoins each day, or $1.15 million. So theoretically, less money is needed to sustain current price levels, and the lessened supply should eventually put a squeeze on the market to find a new equilibrium. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 05:39:36
Only loosely. As is indicated by the almost double spot price premium that gbtc commands. An ETF would have farrrr more liquidity &amp; ease of access.
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:19:00
Honestly.. Since this is basically "free money" that you never would have had in the first place, I would just sit on it for a few months until two things happen:
A) you get a better understanding of bitcoin and how to use it,  &amp; 
B) bitcoin is currently undergoing a rise in valuation (for many different reasons) which *MIGHT* continue to play out over the coming summer months. There is a very real possibility that the value of the bitcoin you currently hold could rise in that time. 
For anecdotal purposes, back in 2013 I gave a friend $5 in bitcoin just so he could play with it.. Literally a month later he told me it was worth $50 (because of the bubble at the time).. Not saying that will happen again. But it just goes to show how quickly these things can escalate when/if it hits full throttle. 
Anyway I saw your original post a few days back, keep up the stellar work out there!!

I'm no expert, but id assume that when lightning networks are in place they will be grouped into batches, and the batch is what will have this time lock feature.

Care to expand on your point? 
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:52:15
My take on it is this as follows: 
We can either 
**A)** just say fuck it and demand a simple block size increase FIRST, from 1MB to 2MB (which coordinating consensus on this would surely drag out for at least 6 months, if not much longer). Then okay... We have 2MB blocks. Now what? 
OR 
**B)** We push segwit first, which almost doubles the allowable transactions, effectively giving us just about the same transaction increase as a 2MB block would, WITHOUT doubling the size needed for storage. THEN, after segwit we bump up the block size to 2MB or whatever, only now we have DOUBLE the transactions in 2MB blocks w/ segwit than 2MB blocks without segwit. PLUS the additional benefit of allowing other improvements to the protocol, AND solving malliability. 
Seems like a no-brainer to me... Right? Someone please correct me if I'm misunderstanding anything here. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 04:29:31

Late 2012 a friend showed me Silk Road. I was  surprised by the pricing being so cheap. 28.0 for this and 47 for that. That's when he told me they use their own types of tokens called bitcoins and they were currently $12 a token. I figured this was just something that could only be used on that site and forgot about it. Then fast forward to early 2013 I saw a post about bitcoin  make it to my front page on Reddit. I think it hit $30 or $40 at the time. I did a bunch of reading up and talked to my friends about it. They said it was dumb and sure to crash but I kept an eye and jumped in a week or so later.

This ETF (if approved) will be in a league of its own. Let's face it, eventually we need to be able to have SOMEWHERE that users can trust keeping their bitcoins if they don't feel up to securing them themselves.

@_date: 2015-08-05 17:53:33
Your friend has already made up his mind. Just say something like this: "okay, that's your opinion. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world disagree with you, and have for 6+ years now, but that's your own prerogative. The system works weather or not you believe in it." then smile, and leave it at that. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:40:46
Personally, I think we will surpass the previous ATH in the next 24 months. A few reasons being: block halving, ETF(?), Gemini, OpenBazaar, global debt fiasco, 21inc(?) , boundless startups &amp;  new applications &amp; implementations arriving almost daily, network effect, blocksize increase(?) etc. etc. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:24:53
Awesome, its about time! Granted the mention of bitcoin and crypto in general is relegated towards the sidelines (behind ApplePay, Google Wallet, Paypal etc.) in the actual proposal document, but its only a matter of time. Implement them all. Whichever system is best will rise in usage organically over time.
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:26:21
Give it time, the next wave of merchant adoption will look like our bubble charts for the value do. Long periods of nothing followed by short explosions. 2014 was really the first time bitcoin garnered mass attention on a global level. It will take one or two more event like that before things start to rapidly change. (there's still a very big IF in all of this though) 
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:51:58
Ahh yea, gotcha. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:08:10
What's the difference between this and BIP 101? What would the next block size increase be, and when?

This time might be different though. The last time China pumped they were really the only ones... This time we have the Eurozone drama and a years worth of positive media coverage in the US.. I could see the west joining in on the FOMO this time around and bringing us to new levels.

Are you at the conference in Seattle by chance? I'm the one who posted the photo of the text message (on the front page) with my buddy who is there currently.

My buddy works for Microsoft and knows I'm a total geek about it. I asked him for specifics. Will update if I find out more. 
Edit: there was a slide with companies &amp; projects that Microsoft believes will be major disruptors and the Bitcoin logo was right next to the Tesla logo.. Wish I had been there to provide more detail!

@_date: 2015-07-27 21:21:29
Hey that's an even better response than I had expected, and I'm glad to hear it! Yes to all of the above, the implications are huge. It's going to be extremely interesting to see how bitcoin and blockchain tech evolve over the next decade! 
Out of curiosity. Do you and your peers see blockchain tech as something that can be implemented singularly (without bitcoin per se), or do you see bitcoin as one of the first of many applications that leverage the bitcoin specific blockchain? (hopefully I'm clear in what I'm asking) I.e. Do you see hundreds of different blockchains with different purposes, or one main, massively robust chain that does it all? 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:14:22
Oh yea that's another thing hw mentioned. Apparently they had more holo-lense demos there and they were "amazing". 
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:10:19
Why does the trust status imply the ETF will arrive sooner than expected? 
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:25:27
Yea, really hoping we can come to some compromise here that unites the community. Neither 100 or 101 are perfect, but as it stands I'm for 101. BIP100 has too many unknowns 
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:47:47
Yea I've been hearing more and more that bitcoin is becoming quite the buzz in finance too
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:28:57
Yea I didn't want to include him but he was the only other core dev username I could remember. Mike Hearn is hopefully seeing this too
@_date: 2015-08-02 01:18:38
2 years. Playing it safe. I'm optimistic for sooner, but we really need to keep pace and make sure things scale equally. Transaction limits, network strength etc 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:12:11
Not that I think this is the reason for the rise in the last two hours or so.. But maybe a few Microsoft insiders felt compelled to buy a little after the event.. Not implausible that a few would

Not sure I follow. What's with the down votes? Is this a legitimate concern or something that we would rather not have rain on our parade right now with the transaction backlogs, multiple forks etc of late? I'm genuinely curious. 
Edit: if it's a stupid question then tell me why with words, not down votes. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:06:19
Eth and litecoin for me. Given that I'm hopeful that this won't turn out to be as bad as I had originally expected. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 02:25:38
Can someone eli5 or point me to a resource on this? 
@_date: 2016-02-18 04:20:07
Put it this way..One system can hide is actions behind closed doors, the other is completely open for you and I to see, should we choose to look. Thats the most fundamental difference between the two..and bitcoins biggest advantage in comparison. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 04:38:56
The code. If you know code (or teach yourself) you can visibly see how everything works. You can see the activity on the blockchain. That's the difference im referring too. Any code that goes in you can see in action. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:11:32
Unless bitcoin IS the planned off ramp/alternative when the dollar collapses. These people are highly intelligent, trust me, if you and I can see the writing on the wall, they've known about it for ages. Think of it this way. If you know something there is a high likelihood of something occurring, would you wait for it to happen to make a move, or put a strategic plan in place ahead of time? Do we know who Satoshi really is?? 
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:39:06
I can confirm that cryptocurrency withdrawals are still processing (mine just completed). For the time being at least. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:09:23
Sometimes I ask myself why Satoshi chose to remain anonymous. It's times like this that affirm exactly why. 
Reading the Twitter shit slinging that you and Charlie partake in (especially recently) compels me to rethink my investment choices for the long haul. 
Would you care to explain what exactly you meant by the main selling point of your creating being a "red herring" (definition = something, especially a clue, that is or is intended to be misleading or distracting)?

@_date: 2016-09-18 14:07:49
No, this is a general discussion forum for anything and everything related to bitcoin. Major news, new ideas/use cases etc. 
Bitcoin is digital cash with a fixed total supply. It's a relatively new development and nobody is quite sure yet how big it will grow to be, or where/how it will be used when it fully matures. Bitcoins aren't farmed, they are 'mined' by hundreds of thousands of extremely powerful computers all over the world. Humans don't do much more than plug the machines in, keep them cool and let them do their jobs.

How do you know every merchant cashes out? Doubtful that any merchant receives more than 20% of their sales in bitcoin and that's a generous estimate. The fact that they accept it means that they are more than likely enthusiastic about bitcoin, and thus likely to keep a percentage held in bitcoin. And why do you automatically just assume that one wouldn't buy back the small amounts they use to purchase? Most people who have been around bitcoin for a while and make posts in declaration of supporting the network are more than likely doing so. I am. The animation was due to several agitating posts getting the best of me while responding, apologies.

@_date: 2015-04-01 17:24:09
I buy $50 a week so it's offset on my end. The incentive to accept it has to be there. Being greedy and just accumulating doesn't create that incentive. It's a two way road, do your best to meet in the middle if you want this thing to succeed

@_date: 2015-04-09 16:56:50
Yea that's the bureaucratic red tape, nothing to do with the actual technology itself. The tech is there, the regulation and trust takes time. Sending money with bitcoin is as it should be, your whole post complaining about how hard it is to ACQUIRE bitcoin is because of the regulation/trust issues, which come with time. Have some foresight. Your post takes the stance that bitcoin in its current form and the regulations surrounding it today are how things will always be. Have some foresight. The Internet analogy just draws a comparison to something that at one time was also relegated to being 'no more useful than the fax machine. Stop being so narrow minded and impatient

Not sure how I feel about Nathaniel Popper. On one hand he wrote a book about bitcoin (which implies intimate knowledge). 
On the other hand, he did a cringe worthy podcast episode for NPR's 'Planet Money' a few months back during the "stress tests" of the network, where he sent a transaction to the host and completely disregarded using a wallet with dynamic transaction fees (he may not have even included a fee, as the transaction disappeared 24 hours later). And then proceeded to denounce it as being entirely a problem with the network (as opposed to saying, "well, now in times like this if you include a higher fee the delay will be significantly reduced") 
For someone who literally wrote a book on bitcoin that's just laughable. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 01:46:17
The only question is.. Will bitcoin be the chain of choice 
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:45:55

@_date: 2016-10-30 19:52:50
Good points, but aren't the solutions that are being developed actually add ons that will directly interface with bitcoin? I.E. be baked into bitcoin as a whole. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:04:02
Maybe they're just using this as a convenient excuse for when suddenly everyone finds out that banks have been buying up bitcoins as an investment. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:22:18
So how do I get one? I don't see anything from my coinbase account 
@_date: 2016-10-09 00:15:29
This piece was extremely poorly done, Nathaniel Popper should be ashamed. He completely neglected to use a wallet with dynamic transaction fees (which begs the question of whether he included a fee at all) and this is coming from the author of a bitcoin book. He didn't mention anything about paying a higher fee to mitigate delays during times of excess volume at all! Poor journalism at its finest. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 03:03:01

Too much too soon. Infrastructure that's expected to scale to global capacity IS NOT BUILT OVERNIGHT (especially one where none of its contributors are directly paid for their work) ........ Take a second to let that sink in. 
As much as it may seem, every facet of your life right now took MUCH longer than 8 years to get to where we are now. Bitcoin will scale in time. Backlogs won't crash it, and when it's ready for the masses, they will come. Calm the fuck down and have some patience.

Yea, which really sucks if true, and him disappearing like that makes me think that's the only conclusion. Had they been above board and fallen on hard times the community would have helped. But I mean he even posted pictures of his daughter making lunch bags for Christ sake, what a scumbag thing to do if it was all just a con job. This was all back when we used to tip anyone and everyone, I'd estimate he got upwards of $10k minimum in donations from the community at that time.

They can, just in a different form than they do today. Don't underestimate the power of adaptation. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:41:59
Would be $14 million today. That's gotta sting..

Man that's rough, I'm sorry :/ were you on a windows machine? And guessing it had remote sessions enabled under network settings? 
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:42:32
What?? Bitcoin is just money. I'm asking whether this guy was a scammer or not. Seems like he was from what I can tell. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 23:44:36
I would think you should be safe, but I would also like a more definitive answer on this. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:44:09
Only thought that keeps popping into my mind is the age old adage "if it seems too good to be true it probably is" 
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:32:53
Ahh shit, local compromise? So you left your PC on with Bitfinex logged in overnight and you were rdp hacked or something along those lines then? 
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:44:14
Was there a point you were trying to make? I asked about this "charity", not about changetip. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 16:27:38
Gotcha. Good to know, thanks. Both would be amazing. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 03:40:39
Except the timeframes are way off. Top chart is 1 year, and bottom is 2.5 years. Kinda throws a damper in the comparison to me. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:11:52
Is there any chance that BOTH could go live? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:45:21
Yes I'm curious about this too, blocks are going through seemingly fine @ 1mb. Until they get too congested that is. Why do you say the network can't handle it currently? 
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:38:28
Then you've never seen a REAL bitcoin bubble yet. Just wait
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:21:13
Damn... You caught me! 
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:00:51
My understanding is that GBTC literally can't or won't buy new coin supply off the market (hence the premium), the ETF however will buy on the open market the moment they sell that last coin, so they will be extremely liquid. If approved this is good for btc in almost every way. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:29:41
Do you know him IRL? The run was a decent while ago, and it ended right around the time the allegations came out and he dropped off. I'm more asking what happened to his charity though. It was the biggest bitcoin sharing for a long while, and he did get thousands of dollars from the community. I don't feel it's abject to ask what came of the project. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 16:05:15
how do I do that? This is a hosted server using scaleway.com, I am only accessing it using Putty.
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:32:23
Seems like a plausible explanation. Having received as much as he did from the bitcoin community financially I find it hard to believe that he just chose to fade out in conspicuously without good reason. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:49:22
I'm seeing a lot of these types of posts lately. Pretty cool! If you're in the US I'd recommend coinbase, circle, or depending on your area localbitcoins. 
This sub is pretty helpful, feel free to ask us any questions you might have! Practice good security and try not to risk too much in a period if/when 'fomo' fully kicks in!
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:17:24
Awesome, thanks! 
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:17:33
From inception? 4 ish years. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:04:56
Oh wow, that worked, thanks! I'm assuming it'll take a while for the blocks to catch up right? It says 235, 909 for "blocks" but I know we're getting close to 420,000. Also, am I safe to just leave this running indefinitely? Really the only reason I setup this server to begin with. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:35:54
Great, thanks so much for your help! 
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:37:58
Thanks, I finally figured it out thanks to everyone's help,  but now I'm running into an issue regarding volume size. I have two volumes, a 50gb and a 150gb,i originally installed bitcoind and had it running but it maxed out the main drive, so is there an easy way that I can either A) merge the volumes, or B) specify bitcoind to install on my 150GB drive? Ideally I would be able to merge them but I've tried several things I've found on forums (fdisk etc) with no luck. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 00:03:59
 My thinking is more along the lines of the global banking elite realizing that this fiat house of Cards can't and won't go on forever( .
Once you come to that conclusion you realize there are two options:
A) Adopt a 'wait and see' approach, hoping that things play out in your favor in the aftermath. 
B) create an alternative well in advance. In this case, one that appears to embody the opposite of everything that the old system stood for, because you know how disenfranchised and skeptical the general public will be to any solution that is provided by "those who got us in this mess in the first place".  Added to the fact that a universal or 'one world' currency has been envisioned for quite some time now. 
I'm inclined towards option B because I think bitcoin has been around far too long to not have had intervention  (see liberty reserve &amp; bit gold)  were it truly against the agenda of those who seemingly have the most to lose (govts and banks).

So I've setup a Scaleway server but am a bit confused on how to move forward from there. Is this server only accessible via terminal/command line? How do I run bitcoind if so? This is as far as I've gotten:  
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:19:39
I would think so.
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:15:40
If you're broke you probably should be focusing on building up regular savings in fiat before you allocate money to investments of any kind. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:45:38
Wait..huh? 
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:39:32
Any ideas how I can merge volumes in the command line? That or a way to specify which volume bitcoind gets installed on? It's defaulting to my 50gb drive and thats not enough so I need to merge my 150gb drive with the 50gb,or specify it to install on the 150.
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:43:31
If bitcoin is ever going to go mainstream then I'm sorry but we're just going to have to move past this mentality. While it's great to you have the **option** to control your own money, lots of people don't want that much pressure on their shoulders. Do you think regular non techie type people want to deal with securing their own life savings? Hell, most people have routine passwords that could be brute forced in minutes! 
What if we move towards a trend where it's a known fact that most people have the keys, or knowledge of how to access keys to their life savings at home, just imagine what that would do to home invasions. 
If crypto is going mainstream were going to have services that provide bitcoin banking and are heavily secured &amp; insured. Coinbase and circle are the steps towards that, like it or not. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:31:23
$10k would only put bitcoin at around a $100 billion market cap. Basically it would be 1/6th the size of Apple's market cap at that point.... So yea, gonna have to disagree with you there buddy. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 19:53:10
Looking at your comment history I see no good reason to "trust you" on anything.

Hmm.. Doesn't sound scammy at all.

Good thing it's free to create multiple copies then.

How did they access the account to begin with to even add sms authentication? Wouldn't they have needed your Google Auth 2fa to login to finex? Has finex fixed this exploit yet? 
Really sorry about that having happened though, thats horrible. Do you have any recourse? 
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:15:47
Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks for the response. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:41:43
Yea that's what I was referencing but any eth related post gets removed unfortunately. For some reason the eth clan sees this as not all that big of a deal, which is absurd to me. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:38:16
IMO they would have shut it down in 2013 or early if they were going to. If I put my tinfoil hat on I think that this is all a part of  the plan... 
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:34:08
Whaaaa? Not made by humans? There's no definitive proof of the 'willy bot'to my knowledge. All I know is people could (and did) sell their coins for that price at that time. That's all that matters. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:46:33
As far as I recall bitcoin first had value in 2009, and then hit 1000 in late 2013. Sooo 4 years, right? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:35:04
What's the earliest you realistically see bitcoin hitting a $1 trillion market cap? (assuming that it ever does) I'd guess 2020, but even that might be wildly optimistic. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 23:48:29
I watched one of these early in July and it was completely wrong. We'll see about this time, but I doubt it.

Details please? Did you leave a copy of the private keys of a computer with access to the Internet at all? Did you generate the keys online or offline? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:30:18
What would you define as a hell of a lot? 
@_date: 2016-07-28 03:25:17
Does anyone know where I can find a similar chart for when the last halving occurred? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:51:22
Not sure about that, but you can allocate a certain percentage of each paycheck, so if you want 50% of your monthly pay to go into bitcoin, then I would just set it up for 50% of each paycheck to go in, rather than 2 and 2.
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:24:40
Will this work if I live in the US? 
@_date: 2016-07-23 03:22:06
