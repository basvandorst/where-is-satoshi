My apologies, and yes, for sure.
However, the very fact that people have the drive to do it is really not all that funny though -- it's really tough to watch, especially for those of us who've been around for a long time.
Many of us are simply trying to build a stronger, healthier ecosystem, one that we can all be proud of -- and I think we are doing it (your team is one of many good examples of this). It's just a shame that we're unable to have a truly open open dialog about how to develop the protocol on some of the most popular communication channels.

This is ridiculously naive.
During those periods you outline, we saw real tx growth. Now, tx growth is pinned -- which is killing current and future use cases. Until we make some actual progress on the scaling issue, good luck building the buy pressure necessary to push us to those higher levels.
Ask yourself: Would bitcoin be useful if it cost you $100/tx in fees? In some cases, yes, it would, but in the vast majority of situations (and for the vast majority of people) it makes no sense.
My point is that to let "Bitcoin just keep being Bitcoin." is actually impossible until we have some sort of scaling solution in place as (spoiler alert) Bitcoin is no longer being "just Bitcoin" anymore.

I'm not against Core executing a PoW change. If that's what the team wants to do then great. But if you think that the entirety of the Core supporter base is going to consider that to be a "no brainer" then you're dreaming.
They've spent the last 2 years conditioning their supporters to fight any (any) change that requires a hard fork (contentious or not) and further splitting up their supporters would most certainly be suicide for them.

Bitcoin is what the majority of the ecosystem deems it to be.
What you currently call 'Bitcoin' is a hard fork of an older client that also happened to be called 'Bitcoin'. We've all collectively agreed that the protocol we're currently using to process and secure our transactions is 'Bitcoin'.
Look at Ethereum. What does the community call the version that hard forked? They call it Ethereum. The 'original' lost its name because it was the minority fork.
If both Bitcoin chains do somehow survive, which is very unlikely due to a multitude of reasons, the minority fork will concede in the same way whether its few supporters like it or not.

The exchanges will do whatever is in their best economic interest.
The authors of that letter were accused of altering it after it had been signed by one or more of the exchanges.
Much of the end result hangs on the hope that Core can retain the support of BitFury (which is already up in the air now). A 95/5 split will certainly result in the minority chain dying -- and hard forking to a different PoW won't be enough to save it due to the negative connotation that word has among so many of Core's supporters.

You can say that for any limit -- 1KB blocks exceed the hardware and network potential of your uncle's 1997 mobile pager -- should that be able to run a node? If not, why not?
You guys talk about how increasing the block size limit will increase centralization, saying a guy in Zimbabwe should be able to run a node on his hand-me-down desktop with a 1Mbit/s satellite connection but the most centralized part of bitcoin isn't the nodes, it isn't even the miners, it's the developers.
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:19:20
Having actually looked at the code, I personally think both approaches are *reasonable* at a technical level -- even though they may pressure Bitcoin to grow in slightly different directions.
But I do have a preference -- which is actually based on discussions I've had with various developers from both 'camps'. I find that one of the two camps stands out as consistently condescending, which is very off-putting and makes serious debate very frustrating.

That doesn't matter. What matters is that if I wanted to, I could fool you into thinking that my payment was going to go through by putting a low or 0 satoshi fee. If you didn't know better, you'd be out w/e I got in exchange. Easy peasy lemon squeezy ^tm .
They're complaining about 'slow' confirmations times but that's hardly the biggest issue w/ Bitcoin assuming all payments eventually get confirmed (which is my point, in that we can't).

@_date: 2017-01-31 18:30:01
This is simply not true.
BU is the result of 18 months of attempts to compromise with those who were against increasing the block size limit.
Recall BIP 100, BIP 101, BIP 109, etc. With BIP 109 (2MB HF w/ continued growth at some point after) being the last attempt to work with the side asking for a more and more conservative approach each time a new (HF) proposal is put forth.
The debate eventually devolved into HF vs SF. Those willing to HF collectively decided to give up trying to work with those who wanted to keep the original 1MB limit in place (ignoring creating a separate pool for it, eg. with SegWit), which is now why BU has the majority support as it truely is the ultimate solution (from the hard forker's perspective).

It wasn't considered urgent until way after he had disappeared.
Take a personal example from a couple of years back:
  - Our app has X users.
  - Our system can handle 50X users.
  - Our user base is growing, but not in a way that we can create an accurate projection for.
  - Upgrading our system has a cost impact of Y.
  - The team agrees that the system upgrade will need to take place eventually.
What would you do in our situation? Would you implement the upgrade right away? Would you wait until the issue becomes more urgent?
Satoshi decided it wasn't urgent enough to take action on, which most would agree was the right call at the time.

You do realize that all they do is check that references are correct right? They even show the rejected ones.

It said there was an error and gave him the option to *re-purchase*. To me, that sounds like they did in fact cancel it.

I've met a total of 2 Bitcoiners in person. Both live(d) in the Greater Vancouver region.
As far as brick-and-mortar prevalence goes, Bitcoin is pretty much dead where I'm living (which wasn't the case back in 2014).

Yes. All but one local retail near us has stopped accepting bitcoin. It just isn't worth it for them.

Most Canadian banks and credit unions have no-fee credit cards. No-fee debit cards is an industry standard (although monthly bank fees can be anywhere between $0 and $500/yr.
My personal (credit) card is $0 fee and provides (an average of) 1% cash back on all purchases.

@_date: 2016-10-13 20:43:29
You're right that the relationship isn't linear.
The part that makes it complicated is that it's very possible that a larger block size limit will result in a lower barrier to entry resulting in faster adoption and a higher price (per BTC), which is currently a bigger portion of a miner's revenue.
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:57:23


Perhaps if it was 2014, but nobody wants to pay [28c in fees]( to read a news article.

He also said that he converts 100% of the bitcoin he gets to USD through his payment processor.

We lose another use case every time fees rise.
Companies that have built their business around this technology are moving to alts not because they want to but because they no longer have a choice.

Maybe people should actually read their reasoning for the change as it does make logical sense.

@_date: 2015-11-28 00:14:02
This to me seems like the most obvious way to implement such a change.
What was the reasoning behind implementing it in a way that allows for each new re-broadcasted transaction to specify a different set of pay-to addresses?
Are there any good reasons why I shouldn't now be worried about brick-and-mortar 0-conf transactions?

@_date: 2017-05-16 16:56:49
Which is ironic, because every day Bitcoin becomes more and more worthless as a payment rail for 'transacting online' as fees continue to double each month.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:52:23
Get a wallet that does dynamic fees or you're going to be asking this question every time to make a tx (if you can afford to do it as fees have been doubling every few weeks/months for a while now).
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:27:33
Because the way that their asset is structured is highly limited. It's, unfortunately, not an ETF where they can re-buy new baskets of BTC to account for an influx of dollars.
Fees also play a roll in reducing the exchange rate.
Also, ~0.1 is better as you don't have to buy in exact amounts of whole BTC.

Fees have been severely impacting businesses for months now (source: I work for one). The reality is that what businesses are *actually* doing doesn't line up with your assumption.
Instead, companies are being driving to alts as most of them seem to get that this debate isn't going to be resolved anytime soon.

I did, but only because they added Ethereum (which Quadriga has now).
I actually prefer Quadriga's UI (less buggy). I've never withdrawn CAD (only BTC, which only takes a few minutes), so I can't comment on that.

It isn't 'split' until it's spent.
The 25 BTC block reward (+ fees) is given to the miner who can find the magic nonce value (a number) that makes their block valid to the network.

You will not make your money back on an S7, even with free electricity.
You'll be much better off using the money you would have spent on an S7 to buy bitcoin directly.
