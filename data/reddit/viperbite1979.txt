Here you see your transaction fees compared to the (current) recommended transaction fees:
From | Duration | Tx-Size | Satoshi/Byte | Fee (BTC) | Fee (mBTC) | Fee (μBTC) | Fee (EUR) 
Your Transaction| 0-30 min | 224 | 454 | 0,00101700 | 1,01700 | 101,70 | 14,01
bitcoinfees.21.co | Fastest | 224 | 380 | 0,00085120 | 0,85120 | 85,12 | 11,73
bitcoinfees.21.co | Half Hour | 224 | 370 | 0,00082880 | 0,82880 | 82,88 | 11,42
bitcoinfees.21.co | Hour | 224 | 300 | 0,00067200 | 0,67200 | 67,20 | 9,26
Hmm looks good to me, fee is high enough, should be included in a block soon.
According to [BTC.com]( block-explorer it seems like your transaction is marked as double-spend. This could be the reason why it will not be included in a block.

if you want help you need to provide more information. At least the transaction id would be helpful. You are not offering sensible information with a tx-id.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:45:16
~~This is a good question i don't have an answer for. One of your double-spending transactions will get confirmed i think. Normally i would say the btc is already transfered to the target-address of the transaction which was not marked as the double-spend transaction. But i'm not 100% sure.~~
Ah okay, after further digging through your transaction history it seems that your input address is still empty and is waiting for confirmations of its own transaction. 
This tx-id **9067c5dfeee6f4cc1c983c12128000e426a18331b818b55299f69a227db40a72** tries to send 0.07 BTC to this **1Atr7bEqqfSEXffPHyweJUuZ7vrpZPqpvF** address and the transaction is still UNCONFIRMED because of a very low transaction fee. 
Than the address **1Atr7bEqqfSEXffPHyweJUuZ7vrpZPqpvF** tries to send its BTC to the next address **14AeVRjEsGjQ8o62znx1DWm8JaroB3LnKQ** in transaction **b62b08542adc48d897411fdc04122ab66e5988b8c04bd756ea2282bade561a70** which has also a very low fee and is still UNCONFIRMED.
And finally the address **14AeVRjEsGjQ8o62znx1DWm8JaroB3LnKQ** again tries to send the BTC to the final address **1AGmaD67UjtFkHYcdALQA2racoKddWG39J** with a very high fee. This produces the problem that the last transaction would normally confirmed before the other two transactions were processed by the bitcoin network and therefore is marked as double-spend. 
Your input address does not have the neccessary amount to fulfil the transaction and therefore it will not be included in a block unless the other transactions do confirm.

Its not huge **compared** to the current transaction fees.
Transaction fees are calculated on size (bytes) and are currently recommended at 140 satoshis / byte. So if you want to get it into a mined block as fast as possible you have to pay 0.006 BTC for a transaction with the size of 3768 byte.
But yeah, it is expensive at the moment to get a transaction through with this size.

First of all congrats, you are now a millionair :)
First make sure that you still have the private-key of your wallet and are able to transfer some funds. Maybe just make another wallet and transfer a little amount of bitcoins to it.
Then i would make accounts on multiple different exchanges because all exchanges have a monthly volume which you can deposit from it. So you are not able to spend all your bitcoins at once even if you would like to do it. But you can do it on a monthly base. At least at Kraken.com you can only withdraw up to 200.000 EUR (i think). Multiple exchanges will help you here.
As far as i know (at least in Germany) if you have your bitcoins more than one year you don't have to declare it to the IRS. 
I would try to cash out 50% of the Bitcoins and keep the rest, maybe to price will rise in the future. But you need to think about this yourself.
Good luck and happy spending. 
PS: Buy you father a real good ssd :D
PPS: I am relativly new to bitcoin and this suggestions are only my opinion. Maybe someone came with a better way to go.

I have had the same problem. It takes up to 5 work days for them to 'check' your deposit money when you make a submission from a country which they think are high risk countries because of money laundering. In my case it was Germany. After 4 days my account was able to withdraw EUR and BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:48:00
Yeah i think this would end the debate and we could proceed. 
Also i read about a hongkonk scaling meeting where the core team agreed to an increase of the blocksize before implementing LN or other improvements. Therefore i think we should take the pill and go forward from this point. 
I'm not a BU fan either, but something must happen and a HF would be bad for both sides.

no tx-id? then **

Here you see your transaction fees compared to the (current) recommended transaction fees:
From | Duration | Tx-Size | Satoshi/Byte | Fee (BTC) | Fee (mBTC) | Fee (μBTC) | Fee (EUR) 
User | Custom | 668 | 70 | 0,00046900 | 0,46900 | 46,90 | 0,55
bitcoinfees.21.co | Fastest | 668 | 200 | 0,00133600 | 1,33600 | 133,60 | 1,56
bitcoinfees.21.co | Half Hour | 668 | 200 | 0,00133600 | 1,33600 | 133,60 | 1,56
bitcoinfees.21.co | Hour | 668 | 160 | 0,00106880 | 1,06880 | 106,88 | 1,25
Your estimated wait time lies around 45-1080 minutes or  	6-115 blocks
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:39:11
i think you mean the 'Glacier Protocol'  
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:53:13
The 'chome-app' wallet is not that good, because you cannot change the fee in any other way then using the options 'fast fee', 'normal fee' and 'slow fee'. Therefore i use electrum in combination with my ledger nano s because you have much more control over your transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-03 14:20:00
Your fee is not that huge in contrast to the current fee costs.
your transaction is 3768 byte in size.
FEE: 0.00245570 BTC / 3768 byte = 65 satoshi / byte
at the moment the recommended fee is 140 sathoshi / byte 
which would result in a fee of 0.00602880 BTC for a transaction contained in the next block.
So just wait... it'll go through 
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:18:35
The amount of a transaction doesn't matter. Only the size of your transaction is relevant and $0.88 doesn't say anything about if it is a 'high' or 'low' transaction fee when the size is unknown. 
You know it's through when you have at least one confirmation on it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:54:55
Click the on the electrum sign in the top left corner of the app and then click 'Show Seed'. Then you can see your 12 word seed which you can use to restore your wallet on any other wallet provider
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:20:07
All your pre-fork bitcoins are valid on both chains. And therefore in a simplified manner your pre-fork coins are worth both values combined. After the HF-event there will be two coins (BTC + BTU)

@_date: 2017-05-18 16:11:06
Never encountered this problem. A fee of 200 sat / byte (in your case 0.001636 btc for a 818 byte tx) should work.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:52:32
My calculator says this (~3 USD i think) :
From | Duration | Tx-Size | Satoshi/Byte | Fee (BTC) | Fee (mBTC) | Fee (μBTC) | Fee (EUR) 
Yours | 0-180min | 818 | 200 | 0,00163600 | 1,63600 | 163,60 | 2,77
bitcoinfees.21.co | Fastest | 818 | 390 | 0,00319020 | 3,19020 | 319,02 | 5,40
bitcoinfees.21.co | Half Hour | 818 | 360 | 0,00294480 | 2,94480 | 294,48 | 4,98
bitcoinfees.21.co | Hour | 818 | 270 | 0,00220860 | 2,20860 | 220,86 | 3,74
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:01:06
did you specify your fee in btc? 0.001636?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:18:44
it is normal, but your fee is not that high. 49 sat/byte have u paid and there are plenty transactions (&gt;10k) in the mempool which have higher fees than you. So it will take a while to get that transaction into a block.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:30:28
Yep, it will get through but it will take some time. The next time you can check the mempool and/or a site where fee estimations for a given time range are displayed.
[mempool stats]( 
[fee estimations](
i prefer to check the mempool and look for myself how many transactions are above my fee i want to pay, because the fee estimations are sometimes too high also
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:34:54
sometimes when the mempool is not very big even a transaction with a low fee does not take much time. It all depends on how many unconfirmed transactions are in the mempool and how high the fee's are in contrast to your transaction and fee.
