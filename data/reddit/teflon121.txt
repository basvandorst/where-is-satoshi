If you can afford to, buying bitcoin lower than the rest of your coins you have successfully lowered the entry fiat amount of your coins..  Once it raises, your breakeven fiat value is now lower..   Doing it right.. Kudos

I respect your candor. And your approach.  My simple point is this.  Some if not most of your community is literally ambushing us at our homes. Think Jehovah's witnesses.

It was me and four friends, the server was nice, and attended to us regularly.  We arrived at 7 and by 8 the place was nearly full, was a nice place, easy to find parking in the area.  Portions were stupid amounts..  We had waaaay too much for the 4 of us..   everything was great, their sauces are actually dam good and unique too..  After being with bitcoin from the sub $2 range, this was a great day for me. Paying with bitcoin in a retail establishment, and it was seamless..  The short haired waitress has zero knowledge of bitcoin, so we tipped her $15 in cash and 0.027 btc, I hope the bitcoins make it to her as I just overpaid the bill some..   She earned it, hopefully she will start appreciating bitcoin more..

Thanks captain obvious.  My point was being.. Protect yourself FULLY..  Dont donate a warning wallet, just learn to protect yourself, not band aid solutions.. Chances are if you get your fake wallet hacked, AND you have your less than protected wallet on same computer and not in cold storage you deserve to lose both..  This bandaid solution is NO solution.. Just a way to get a warning so that you can see your funds vanish in front of your eyes

This spitting you claim to recieve is nothing but adults calling you kid coiners on the greedy ridiculous attempt at getting rich with no effort.. Yes, it hurts you missed the beginning of bitcoin.

Thank you, i wish more of your community was like you, articulated and tactful.  Dont let it goto your head.  And yes, income equality is needed, and extremely important, there are too few, with too much that are too selfish. Cryptocurrencies are starting to give us back a simple human right, to control what is ours. Most countries obviously are becoming a police state. A slow systematic removal of simple rights..  Its very close to being unlawful to eat while driving due to distraction.  This is a poor way of teaching people whats wrong by simply making a law to generate revenue and to educate people to pay attention.

Yes, annoyance..immaturecoin makes a mockery of all alts and btc. Its childish, and moronic.. And its also a clear greedy cash grab.. Its takes away from REAL discussion about crypto currencies.. I liken it to discussing something important.. Lets say.. For instance I'm a dr and operating on the president and something goes wrong and we're discussing how to save his life with another dr, then a stupid 11 year old kid wearing a barney outfit comes in and grabs onto the legs of the drs and demands to be heard because he wants a pudding..

@_date: 2014-03-18 00:27:04
Well, intelligent queries do exisit! I hesitate to make any predictions with bitcoin..  I made enough of them in the early years to learn bitcoin is growing so rapidly that trying to predict it is just a way to be wrong quickly in the future.  I also believe the influx of worthless coins is hurting bitcoin..  Its confusing enough for non techies to graspe and use. A stupid dog with glasses and poor grammar is nothing that will help intelligent and sometimes wealthy people to adopt bitcoin and take it seriously.

Have been using cavirtex since the very beginning.. Have had all positive relations with you guys.. But in the past my only complaint would be in times of rallys and massive market movements the site became very slow and hard to use.. Even to the point of getting cloudfire flare warning or whatever your hosting server puts up when the site cant be reached or is inundated with requests.. Mind you this was a few months ago, i hope there have been some improvements on the speed of the site and its trading.. I have saw wild trading errors during these busy times and have saw the buy price lower than the sell price.. The trading engine seemed very slow.. But other than that. Keep up the great work. Thanks for bringing fees down to earth.

Dont forget erecting hundreds of microwave towers to connect hubs for trading quicker..  By milliseconds as well.. Still being errected today fyi
@_date: 2014-05-06 07:52:19
Ughhh.. Never mind.. Im actually paid a shit ton of money to keep this archaic banking system running.. And im not directly comparing them.. Only in ratio of your so called wasted effort and resources..  But continue to ramble in your narrow thought processes by all means..

Once again your judgement is as good as your spelling..  Its the internet, if i have offended.  Which i hope..sell your connection to the jnternet.. Youre too soft skinned lil boy..
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:19:34
Its also know as class A Fraud.  Pretty simple concept. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:41:17
Now youre just creepy..   Consult with your kidcoin friends before responding this time..  Get a consensus of the most funny comment you can come up with and get back to me
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:30:28
Stfu.. You called me a faggot..  I love the hypocrite in you.. The more you reply the more I realize you are retarded and dont grasp reality.. This is my last reply'tard. Enjoy the tard life simpleton..  
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:45:13
This and your other vulgar comment's are an olive branch?   Hmmm. I better goto to urban dictionary and make sure olive branch isnt a new slang you kids are using for the meaning of verbal diarrhea..
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:30:05
My turn, how many kidcoiners does it take to screw in a lightbulb?  Never mind, mommy will do it, and make sure you have a night light next time. :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:11:04
Bfl! Boooooo
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:46:11
You my friend should look into Elliot wave theory..  Its almost like the news HAS to happen.. And does.. Its uncanny
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:14:22
If you were smart. And not needing the money the bitcoins are worth right now.. Hang onto the coins for the next major price increase.. Which should happen in the next several months if not sooner.  Then! Cash out and come back here and thank me.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:17:25
Youre welcome.  Im sorry to say im not much of an animal lover. But i would take great satisfaction if i could purchase peanut butter for my friend and you release the 'hounds' on him and let nature take its course..  He has a lot of frustration, so dont judge him.  Many thanks... :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:42:17
Now youre getting it!..  Kid coin is just one big troll.   Thanks for pointing that out!
@_date: 2014-01-25 05:14:13
Ill be going there more often.. thats for sure.. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:58:10
FINALLY! Someone understands these childish antics..  
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:43:49
I dont have a wheelchair ramp at my house.. How are you going to teach me a lesson?   Retard..

Source is all the protest videos with Karpeles waist sized fat arms holding a dessert coffee
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:06:20
Perfect answer..  its all relative..  I would imagine 1.50 USD in Lithuania is more like a $5 dollar (cad) bill here..
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:41:52
You could have just agreed.. The long description about unrelated Nintendo's is interesting..   But you fail to understand how the real world banking network works and how much more wasteful it is then the blockchain
@_date: 2014-05-05 02:26:17
Hes right! Enough of this childish nonsense that takes away from real development of cryptos.. Grow up! We are sick of you and the rampant vomit that is kidcoin
@_date: 2014-01-25 05:39:36
I ordered my drink of choice, Rye and coke, and they happened to even serve me my fav brand too, Wisers..   they got a special place in my heart now!
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:04:24
Im flattered, really i am.. But i dont swing that way brah.  I realize now this was all foreplay to you now, and i feel dirty now..     
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:50:06
And you somehow think im crying? Sounds like your about to shove a controller up somewhere dark and record a viral video..  Mommy will let you play World of warcraft next week if youre good..
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:40:20
Max is a child.. Im sorry, but hes an idiot..  Grown man spewing childish rhetoric..
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:54:25

I spend fiat because i dont need the cash..   Wtf?  Asinine comment award
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:13:26
Ugh? Twice is over and over..  Got it thanks douche..  I used over and over twice! Have i offended you? Do you understand the term fiat encompasses all forms of cash?  Move along blowhard... Move along
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:16:54
No.. Thats exactly what they are doing..  Kidcoiners might as well be Jehovah's witnesses..  Wait till Awake Doggy pamphlets and CoinTower start showing uo on your doorstep and eventually mistakenly open the door to get ' vomitted on'
@_date: 2013-08-15 04:42:21
Diff now 50 mill... :S
