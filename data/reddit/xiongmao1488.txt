The site I manage is offensive and third party services are frequently harassed by people aiming to shut it down. I had a referral link on my site encouraging people to use BTC to donate, and it was that account that got terminated.
I did not, however, use Coinbase API to process purchases or transactions. I just referred people to Coinbase to use it for their Bitcoin purchases.
This is speculation, but outside of that site, I do literally nothing illegal. I am the most by the books human to live. I have to be because of my site. If it was anything else I'd have no idea because they don't want to tell me.

Presumably someone bothered them over it.

And of course, in scary terrifying megacorporation fashion, there's not even a phone number I can theoretically call to talk to a person.
Have a local wallet kids. The Big Bitcoin fuckboys aren't going to be any better than the PayPal and MC/Visa fuckboys.

Nonviolent discriminatory site is probably the closest descriptor I'm willing to provide. No where is it even implied that people should be harmed, harassed, etc. It's just not something the average person would find tasteful.

Wish they would tell me.

I don't.
