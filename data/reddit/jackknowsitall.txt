1. Let Roger talk about past times, back when bitcoin was about fighting the establishment, not fighting itself. I bet he has a lot of interesting stories. No matter what you think of him now, he wasn't always a douchebag.
2. The whole theymos, bitcoin.org, r/bitcoin VS. MemoryDealers, bitcoin.com, r/btc debacle. No one benefits from it, it hurts user adoption and from the outside it just looks like a childish fight.
3. The fact that both [bitcoin-abc]( and [btc1]( repos have little to none development activity going on (compared to [bitcoin](
4. Roger's relationship with Jihan/Bitmain.
5. Why we need two, soon three, versions of Bitcoin with similar names. History has shown that cryptocoins are likely to stick around forever, even if only for speculators. We'll probably never get back to only one Bitcoin. I feel like this seriously harms Bitcoin as a legitimate brand. (Imagine two or three Ferrari brands, Ferrari1 Ferrari2x and Ferrari, all claiming to be "the original", wtf?)
6. What exactly "is wrong" with the core devs? From what I can tell they are highly skilled programmers, capable of writing (mostly) bug-free code that handles a crazy amount of money without messing up, and this for almost a decade. Wanting to replace them indicates a huge underestimation of the work they do.
Also: I dare anyone to mention "Satoshi's Vision". Fuck that bullshit. Anyone who claims he knows how Satoshi would act nowdays is a fool. All we know for sure can be read in the original [paper]( and on the forums.

Literally every single line of this passage is wrong

77868 * 10^9 / 21000000 = **3'708'000**$
(77868 * 10^9 was the GWP in 2014 according to [wikipedia](

AFAIK the only fee imposed by coinbase to move your bitcoin is the transaction fee.

How about.... forcing banks to actually own a significant percentage of real money in proportion to credit? That surely would be ridiculous, wouldn't it

Agree. Without formal proofs, smart contracts cannot be considered safe.

This is good and all, but the SEC has bigger fish to fry. They are focusing resources towards a minute problem compared to the global amount of securities fraud. This is an easy way for them to show some teeth and get the public to think they are actually doing something useful. As a regulatory body they have so far failed miserably on every front they fought.
