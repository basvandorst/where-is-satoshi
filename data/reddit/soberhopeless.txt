You seem like you know less than a basic investor 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:47:51
That is correct. I'm just looking for the best way I can ensure myself I did my best to preserve my assets.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:09:18
Gotcha 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:43:31
Exactly. Try putting as much as 15-20 bucks? That should be fast 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:41:35
Localbitcoins.com got you 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:37:38
If you have your private key and 24 seed words which you should've saved you can recover that lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:20:33
Well it's an internet money thing that you put your house mortgage in and it doubles and triples and infinities and we screw all the bad politicians! So Heck yeah! Now you know 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:49:26
Can you send me the message? I'm interested in what it says. Blur out the authentication code, please. 
Edit: speak Russian 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:28:14
Elaborate? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:06:39
That's what I thought. Just wondered if there was a way to import it and *then* change the private keys along with backup phrases. Lesson learned. That's not how wallets work
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:25
Thanks for easing me dude. The only thing I'm worried about is the fee for sending out. Can you use your keys to switch to another wallet with lower fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:25:53
Is that the one where you have to download about 70gb? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:40:45
They are human, they aren't going through pile of these garbage posts tho
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:08:15
Noob about forks. Have BTC on Jaxx, soon my Ledger will arrive. How the heck do you claim those things 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:28:36
Thanks man! In comparison, buying a spare SSD costs about the same as the Ledger:)
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:06:13
Ready to buy in a click as well. Not sure. Feel like we hit the moon and it should drop down a bit
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:47:23
They've got tens of thousands accounts registered every day with the hype nowadays. Other than that I think there are some U.K. trading websites. Wait for someone to tell you which ones are those 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:02:28
It's a gamble. No one guarantees that you will gain from it. If a person is willing to bet their financial stability on something that isn't 100% gonna happen, even if this person wins he will continue to gamble in later life because that's what he'll do until he's on his ass with no money left. 
Plus taxes on capital gains . 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:00:58
How did that happen? I have about the same amount on jaxx ATM 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:57:15
Thanks asshole 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:50:32
Meh, I feel like as long as there's lots of markets out there, the price will differ forever 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:22:27
Gdax is coinbase. It's the same company. Internal transfers are with no fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:56:04
My friend says "market manipulation" is completely alright because that is how business works - people want gains and you can't blame them for it. How do I prove him wrong? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:53:45
Why don't you have a passport? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:34:26
Thats what you call a bad quality shitpost
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:38:03
He is saying that for any transaction on blockchain(internal transactions on trademarkets are not those) you need to pay the miners a fee to process that through the network. You don't directly pay the miners, any wallet or a website will make you pay that fee.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:14:49
Trezor is nice as well
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:03:45
I know that electrum allows to send to multiple addresses but I've no experience with it so I can't say if they'll take a fee for each transaction or not
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:53:05
Look up localbitcoins. I buy my spices for cooking only there cause the fees are exactly for the small purchases/transfers:)
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:51:29
Can you elaborate on how being careful of anonymity is important? I know you can find the Blockchain and the transaction and your wallet key but what's wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:15:30
In two hours?!
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:46:13
Can someone explain how do I redeem these forks? Is this only doable on main US trade markets?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:23
You think this is the good time? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:21:13
To be exact he installed an android extension and after that it got stolen. My private keys and backup seeds are safe and sound but damn. Paranoia is still there. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:38
Well *it is* revolutionary. Bitcoin is currently leaving an important mark in our history. That doesn't mean it *can't* crash at any moment.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:21:35
Not investing time to research safety and everything related to it is the reason of privacy invasion. Government has been invading our lives for hundreds of years but somehow bitcoin sets you off? Are you on meth? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:42:48
I'm telling you what? The facts?:) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:06:37
If you're doing it to brag then I'm not sure what to tell you...stop looking for affirmation from others. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:27:52
Wow thanks so much, how do you know all of this stuff?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:53:34
Care to explain? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:06:41
Fiddy bucks
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:17:28
He bought low, sold on high, then bought again at low
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:52:35
Lmao dude. The only people that ask for your ID and make the conversion harder is people that are behind the trading websites, not the Bitcoin itself. If you were to educate yourself for more than 3 days you'd understand how it works and not rant your tits about how you paid $50 in fees 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:07:26
So you're saying I can be fucked over easily or that 12 seed words are the most important thing 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:36:25
You could wait for a time when transaction fees are at lowest. I don't live in American time so sometimes when it is night there the fees are only $11-15 at most.
Also you could try giving it to them in an account on some exchange? They'd have to do math with one mBtc wouldn't they? Better introduce them how to buy/sell and let them HODL there for the time being. Then if they are more interested and decide to invest in it then let them in on other ways of holding. 
Edit: or gift any other alt coin to them? My gf really digs ether for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:05:11
Congrats man! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:19:59
Prices are much much higher though 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:14:02
Every software wallet can be compromised if you fuck up in terms of malware and somebody knows your private keys. I ordered a Ledger two days ago cause I am extremely paranoid I'll fuck up keeping my private keys safe. 
Lose $1000 or spend $100. I made my choice. 
I recommend paper wallet generating and printing it offline. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:24:14
60-40 btc to ltc 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:15:54
More like 22?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:43:55
Once all the bitcoin is mined its price will go relatively stable and will even out. Question is at what price:P
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:54:29
I'm pretty sure you sell it the same way you bought it. When you've sold it to USD it'll just be there in usd 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:38:27
Lol this subreddit is posted on every 30 seconds why do you think bittrex support is going to see this
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:19
What's the best way to store it off any third-party websites? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:23:36
Exactly. If people are interpreting joke as though it is not a joke perhaps they shouldn't invest at all
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:34
Can you link me a guide for hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:41:51
"Bitcoin" in trending searches already.
