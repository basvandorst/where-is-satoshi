Yes, I am doing. Work in progress.
Two (or more) tier systems are how exchanges work. They're in on it!

The exchanges LIKE the HFTs because it creates liquidity and increases the number of transactions. I do not yet know if the crypto exchanges operate this way, but there will be some who do. By doing so, they will drive up liquidity and volumes, so can offer lower transaction fees, which drives up liquidity and volumes etc. Hence, normally, the exchanges who embrace HFTs do well and tend to dominate.
The exchanges are not your friends. Or at least the most successful ones traditionally are not. Bitcoin does seem special, but I am not convinced the underlying economics have changed. HFTs and exchanges are best friends.

Whilst it is a security issue, so is knowing where the world's stock exchanges are colocated, and that is now all in the public domain. I doubt the bitcoin exchange owners will want to make it public, but there is a point locations are open secrets.
I got the list in the post above from a client looking for private connectivity. Reddit is a forum full of people wanting to talk! ;)

There is an n-tier system. And I believe all tiers are open to anyone. They just have different price points.
The thing that I think most don't realise is that this is a feature of the exchanges; not a design flaw.

The prop guys are already in crypto. Some in a big way. There is a significant opportunity for crypto arbitrage.

I agree with both points. I'm not defending how it works today. Just explaining it to those who might not already understand.

Understood. That's what my clients are looking to NOT use and instead have private, faster, point-to-point service with their algo engines hosted close by to the exchange matching engine. This is what we do for the traditional exchanges today.

Yes, you are correct. The exchanges all use their own systems with no common protocol shared between them (e.g. FIX). However there are trading companies working to integrate with these disparate platforms. It's those firms who are interested in private connectivity.
