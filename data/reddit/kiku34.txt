Bagholders that bought high thanks to willy bot don't want to hear this. They want to believe they didn't just blow a ton of money and will forever look like an idiot as demand for btc continues to go down. Weekly volume hasn't been this low in a long time and everyone expects everyone else will hold till new money shows up. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 05:31:14
Of course a fireside moderated chat is the best time. Their just waiting for the question to be asked. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:20:46
Someone is creating the best miners and not selling them. Who can do that? The Chinese of course. 
Who is keeping the price up and controlling the price? China.
For all I know OKCoin is manipulating the price so it doesn't completely tank which gives them more time to unload coins at higher prices. 
How many holding are actually going to hold if this thing continues down. I'm betting most are holding at a loss hoping the next big pump is right around the corner but when people get tired of waiting and start dumping will everyone else join in. 
Or is some China men out there with hundreds of millions of dollars buying up all the bitcoins as they manipulate the price down while mining all the bitcoins and eventually they'll own most and then pump the price in a couple years from now.

Lol. I realized afterwards that I only had to make 3 trades with that 50btc and I would have ended up with $400,000 a week later. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:32:50
Price went from $166 to $315 quickly and I kept shorting thinking this was the top and price kept going up. Then it went back down to $200 and I kept longing the bottom but the price kept going down. If I would have longed and left it and then shorted the top and left it I would have ended up with $400,000 had I gone all in using margin on OKCoin futures.
@_date: 2015-05-12 03:59:37
Coinbase closed my account randomly one day. I didn't even log in for weeks so I was like WTF. Guess they watch everything you do and eventually they'll close everyones account. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:04:26
I traded my way from .25 to 50btc 5 months ago in like 2 days during the huge dump. Ended up losing it all trading. Hoing for a big pump to like $500 so I can do it again and this time not lose it. 
@_date: 2012-11-12 06:09:14
In my area 1 guy is selling at 10% over and another at 17% over. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:56:01
If you look hard enough you will find the bots making tons of transactions. It's to make people think the coin is getting more and more active. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:28:20
They must be doing it to use as a talking point to new investors. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:59:02
In 2024 there will be about 19,800,000 out of 21,000,000 btc mined.
Getting close to 21 million so I can see it happening if btc is still popular.

Waiting for Coinlab.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:48:39
It may suck but what if it never hits $100 again and in a few years you'll say, "I remember when it was $100 and I could have bought a couple. I would have $300,000 in bitcoin now."
Just sayin'
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:43:30
If I bought 40 bitcoins for $4,000 and the price goes up to $1,000 now I have 40 bitcoins worth $40,000 and I can buy a bunch of shit that I didn't have money for before.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:49:44
I'm in the process of using coinbase. So far things are going smoothly. I'll see if I get my bitcoins on Friday.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:34:47
I hear one of these stories everyday on here. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:45:34
That person doesn't want you to be a rich 26 year old. Disregard and buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:27:24
I use 
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:02:02
We don't know because someone may know how to access the coins but hasn't for years. I would say there are 100,000+ that are lost. Many wallets have only 50 coins so someone just gave up and probably can't access the wallet any more.
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:34:31
There is an update waiting and it will install when you restart your browser. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:34:47
I agree.

For the weak. The strong will come out rich.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:13:06
Coinbase and blockchain.info is all you need to get started. From that point read up and learn more about bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:38:41
Wish i slept a little bit longer. Sold at rock bottom and now up to $200. Should have held. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:16:56
The real question is. How many.
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:02:32
Yes. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:56:20
3 people put in a LOT of money (over a million) today. If that continues to happen expect $300 soon. Eventually people will stop putting in large amounts and I have a feeling it'll go down. How far we don't know. So this current price may be the lowest it will ever get again. We don't know.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:31:03
Check back in a couple of days. Miners are busy due to everyone moving coins trying to cash out. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:44:51
I would love that. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:38:38
Bitmit instead of ebay
bitcoinstore instead of amazon
bitspend for other items online
Just takes time for people to come over. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:20:28
Next week over $150
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:45:33
A comment in that thread mentioned 40,000+ addresses with 50 bitcoins in them. What if Satoshi created a new address for each block and decided to never touch them. So 2,000,000 bitcoins will be forever lost + what has been lost since then. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:30:31
I hear good things about bitinstant and bad things. Seems to be a hit and miss.
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:39:33
We are all waiting to sell. Price down to $100 already. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:44:03
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:03:47
I would watch ads/disable adblocker if Google deposited bitcoins into my address for each ad I watch or view. Unless it was such a small amount. I would want to make over a hundred a year with the amount of time I spend on the internet.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:06:35
Buy now and do as you please with them. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:59:28
Just like the saying goes, "A broken clock is right twice a day."
Keep saying something and eventually you'll be right. Even if it takes 2 years.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:47:47
I do wonder why the people I have been telling about bitcoin over the last 1-2 months still have not bought any. Well, I'll just sit here and let them know how much I'm up.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:17:48
Seems there is some issue in confirming deposits and they probably need to wait a day for the money to clear.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:25:49
Sounds like business as usual at coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:51:46
I put .14 into sdice and realized it was almost $20. Thankfully I won and got back around $38.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:45:12
There are only so many bitcoins that can be mined. If EVERYONE did it then EVERYONE would get like .001 bitcoin a week.
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:05:26

Sounds normal to me. Keep waiting.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:22:06
Wish I read the front page when I woke up. I woke up. Saw the price down $150 and sold. If I didn't I would have all my bitcoins and $3,000 more then when I woke up.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:51:19
Maybe over Easter. It may be best to wait till Monday. Even if it goes up and over $100 it won't make that big of a difference with just 1-5 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:27:52
This isn't the first time someone has done a pump and dump and ddos. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:33:19
Right now litecoin is only good for pumping and dumping on some poor sucker. Go buy 200 litecoins and tell me what you can do with them and what you will be able to do with them in the future...(besides spamming everywhere trying to get people / places to accept them).
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:31:01
You can jump off the gravy train and spend the $1,000 on something you need and I'll keep on watching the price go up and count my profit. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:18:24
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:38:23
Called the crash of 2013.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:53:41
Haha. Lucky you. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:47:01
I would save. How bad would you feel if you cashed out the 19 coins now and in a few years realize you would have $190,000 if you never did that. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:57:49
If all that happens then my bitcoins will be the least of my worries.
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:05:39
Early on when people would mine coins a block award was 50 coins. I assume many people downloaded the program then mined a block for 50 coins. Then noticed it was only worth a couple pennies and just forgot about it. Those coins will never be touched again. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:38:46
My bitcoins are still there.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:50:26
So something like this.
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:49:16
Buy 2 BTC
10 minutes later
Spend 2 BTC
There. You spent some bitcoins and still will make money when the price jumps $10 on the bitcoins you have.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:10:47
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:44:20
1,000 a day and the line is over 9000
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:40:50
Fraud and chargebacks. Who knows if the credit card you are paying with is yours. Stick with cash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:58:42
I think the price would have to go up another 30 times before there is a billionaire. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:38:34
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:37:22
They price would have to go up 709 more times. (709 x 144 x 10 bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:03:01
Deposit cash into a bank account via bitfloor or bitcopia or blueskytraders is probably the easiest. Next would be localbitcoins.com and meet someone in your area. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:43:01
Who knows in the long run. I think it's pretty safe but one can buy bitcoins with cash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:27:56
I heard the wait list is 30,000 machines long. By the time you get it (next year) you'll be making like a dollar a day. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:00:30
And it happens again. Funny how high risk never happens when the price drops. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:00:12
What sucks is if I buy 10 coins today and have $1500 in my bank account. Then on Friday the price has gone up so much I don't have enough funds in my bank account and now I have to cancel the whole order. 
So my advice is have enough money to cover the price increase or buy smaller amounts.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:55:41
Market sell time. Let's go let's go let's go 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:37:00
Just don't complete the deposit and fill out a new one when you want to make a deposit. You just show up, fill out a deposit slip with the account number and give it to the teller with the cash. They enter in the account number, count the cash and give you a receipt. The money shows up in your bitfloor account. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 01:45:08
If possible add recent amount of tips. Maybe once every couple hours say, "1.8 bitcoins have been tipped in the last 6 hours." Not sure if someone can write code that tweets that.
@_date: 2013-03-19 03:43:31
Price not going down? Good time to buy a bunch of coins. Price goes up. We wait to see if it dips before we buy more.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:11:22
And there are only 11,000,000 bitcoins right now, some lost, so we are looking at $5,000. Keep buying people.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:52:00
This is reddit. Memes are expected. :(
@_date: 2013-03-19 04:46:24
You never want to sell your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:35:46
Yeah it won't be worth it. Probably will be under $1 a day by the time you get one. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 08:39:20
I was thinking about buying couple days ago at $33.50 and ended up buying at $34.50. Woot
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:10:33
800 bitcoins won't raise the price much. Need more millionaires buying and holding. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:24:18
Yeah money ends up on bitfloor and you buy bitcoins. To get money from the exchange to your bank account you can do a bank transfer which takes 2-3 days.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:26:05
.43 could end up being $430,000. Sucks
@_date: 2013-03-02 01:24:05
Right, better wait till it hits $40.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:36:08
7 days and the price went up 60x. Classic pump...incoming dump.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:55:51
Some comedian show dissed bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:03:01
What I think. People say bitcoins will end up $10,000 or $100,000 or $1,000,000. If people don't sell that many bitcoins then the price needs to be higher for people to put thousands of dollars into bitcoins. So if people put $90 into bitcoins today and wait and say 1 bitcoin = $100,000 then that $90 turned into $50,000. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:13:41
I am waiting to see if the price goes up or down. Bad time to buy. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:51:22
Ah, yeah. I guess they could still be accessed. Just weird that so many addresses has 50 bitcoins and have never been touched since. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:30:26
$250 buy wall down. Next stop $275
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:42:46
Right now there is only a few thousand bitcoins being sold and some people want to buy 1,000+ bitcoins. So the price goes up.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:40:06
We can only hope they put up a massive buy wall too. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:02:12
I have 3 words for you.
Buy and hold.
That's all you need to do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:52:15
Yeah. I think bitpay is only for online right now but I think it may work in bar type settings too. Put the order in bitpay, the customer pays with bitcoin over a computer and then bitpay sends the money to you. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:51:43
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:51:01
If you bought 10 bitcoins on Friday your wallet would have went up $1,000 already.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:16:02
Good job.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:48:45
Someone needs to (or a group of people) buy that many bitcoins before the price reaches that amount.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:50:50
Depends how many bitcoins are being sold and how many buyers are left. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 09:40:55
@_date: 2013-03-02 01:47:51
I'm sure they got the best deal they could and some other bigger companies may get a better deal on some items. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:33:50
People think the demand will fizzle out and then people will start selling and the price will go down so far everyone else will sell and then we'll all be holding worthless coins. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:09:11
Heard they got hacked and customer data leaked.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:31:57
I would put some. Me personally have put just about all the money I have in bitcoins and now have a couple thousand more then when I started.
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:21:17
That's the beauty of bitcoins. As people die off (or delete their wallet, forget a password) there are less bitcoins and a higher price because of it. I'm guessing over a million bitcoins are probably forever lost. There was a post about a guy who had 3,000 bitcoins but at the time were worth only a couple dollars so they were deleted. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:31:34
Great time to buy. Get in while the price is low.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:15:37
They have 22 people working 7 days a week and looking to add more to help the line move faster.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:44:53

@_date: 2013-03-28 02:12:55
This person doesn't know what they are talking about. Move along.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:26:43
This aint no bubble. People scared of governments taxing our savings so we putting it in bitcoins for good. We can still buy stuff with bitcoins so no reason to take it out. We going to the thousands shortly. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:13:48
The bubble will pop and we'll shoot to $200.
@_date: 2013-03-16 23:58:46
I started at 40 bitcoins and bet .2 and multiplier is 2 and check out how it ended.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:55:37
When they run out of bitcoins to sell at the current rate they will allow you to transfer say $1,000 out of your account and a couple days later they will take $1,000 / current market price and give you your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:29:02
It is considered a donation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:43:15
I'm buying back in next week. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:25:26
In 2140 when the last bitcoin is mined the miners get transaction fees. Unused accounts will sit there forever. By 2140 I don't even know what will be happening so bitcoins may not even be around since something better may have come out.
@_date: 2013-04-01 06:12:57
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:20:50
Hope to profit and then buy stuff with my bitcoins. New computer!! New TV!!!! New phone!!! New couch!!! New everything!!! bitspend.com FTW
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:01:08
Buying and holding and hoping the price goes up hundreds of dollars and then buy the ticket before the price goes down.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:10:33
No one can defend itself against a ddos attack. I would say bitfloor is probably ranked around the 2nd best.

@_date: 2013-04-02 00:35:09
No bubble. We are going to keep all our bitcoins so the price keeps going up and then buy things with bitcoins with our profit.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:14:46
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:17:38
Because at $50, $55, $60, $65 are buy walls. Basically people pick those numbers to sell bitcoins (usually a couple thousand total). So then come the buyers. There are usually enough buyers to buy up the thousands of bitcoins which then sends the price up and over those numbers till it hits the next wall and stops till more buyers come and buy thousands. Unless people start selling thousands and thousands of bitcoins to the point where the price drops it will keep rising. No one wants to sell all their bitcoins because if they do they might miss out on gaining money. So why do people sell you ask. Because people need to pay bills or businesses need to pay people in their currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:43:19
How will I know if you fapped or not? Will you weigh your balls everyday and if they weigh less then the day before I will assume you fapped.

@_date: 2013-04-10 04:29:07
So close. Hopes and dreams crushed.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:12:05
Yeah. Bitfloor and deposit cash at BoA. Hope you get in before the price goes up more.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:07:52
orly? I can't wait for bitcoins to jump $20+ then
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:39:02
I just hope it holds up and isn't a group or single person with millions in mtgox putting up buy walls and slowly buying up all the bitcoins. Then when they have $15,000,000 in bitcoins start cashing out and bring the price the rest of the way down. Then bitcoin will be back around $20.
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:49:23
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:54:33
At the very beginning it was super easy to mine 50 bitcoins over and over. Get a couple computers going and you are getting thousands and thousands of bitcoins monthly. Get a couple more computers going and soon you have multiple wallets with thousands of bitcoins. Add it all up and you could have 4.2 million bitcoins or a billion dollars in bitcoin. Highly unlikely though but I guess it could be true.

I read a post saying over 5,000,000 bitcoins have been moved around this year so far. So half of the bitcoins are being hoarded till a much higher price and lost.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:51:51
Yeah, and there would be way more problems then trying to figure out what will happen to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:00:12
Thanks to my weed smoking habit I found out about bitcoins and now can buy enough weed for the rest of my life. Yippie.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:54:10
The thing is right now either everyone panic sells and the price goes way down or we have dips and the price recovers and continues upwards. For bitcoins to go on and be adopted by more people the price needs to go higher. I hope you have your sunglasses on because the future of bitcoins is bright. BUY BUY BUY

The fees. If 1 bitcoin = $100,000,000 then the fees will add up and the miners will keep on mining.

My parents always told me to save. Now I know why. I could be bitcoin rich.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:33:04
Couple minutes ago. I was counting down.
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:48:31
I would do it soon. There is a new exchange market opening and my sources say there are people with money waiting to invest in bitcoin. If you wait even 1-2 weeks you may be looking at $80 / bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-03-21 00:10:09
Keeps going up because people hear about it for the first time, have money sitting around barely making them any money. They decide to put thousands of dollars into bitcoins. The price goes up. People don't want to cash out because they will be missing out on free money basically. So until the demand dies down the price will stay steady / go up. This is world wide. It is getting easier to save bitcoins. People want to buy digital items online and not have to provide a credit card / name / address so it is much easier to buy stuff. People keep seeing the benefits of bitcoins so it goes up. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:33:07
The demand is crazy. I don't know how the behind the scenes of coinbase works but I'm sure they are wishing they could acquire thousands of bitcoins to sell. Just think what they price could be if they could meet the demand.

Some people have taken all their money out of the bank, put it into bitcoins and had their bitcoins stolen, wallet deleted on accident, locked out of their account. So in some ways a bank is safer to store your money in.

Ya. I didn't realize it at the time but I ended up tossing around $1,000+ bets at a time. I'm sure people who were betting 20+ bitcoins at a time and losing felt much worse.

It may fall $1-$10 short term or there may be some good news and it'll jump above $60 for good.

I have a QR tattoo of my bitcoin address so people can scan my arm and send me bitcoins. I memorized my key. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:56:47
Someone asked how to get bitcoins for free. I said hack or scam. They said who would fall for a scam. I said lots of people. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 03:47:52
They probably have a small team and get thousands of e-mails a day. To respond to all the e-mails would take a small team. Then there is no one left to do the day to day operations. I stopped using bitinstant months ago once I saw the warning signs that bitinstant was going down hill.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:23:12
As the price goes higher it is harder to buy whole bitcoins so it may slow down. I still think the price will need to be in the hundreds though. If it is $200 a bitcoin then most people will be 1-3 bitcoins. Some big spenders could still buy 10. Will there be enough bitcoins for everyone at that price point? Maybe, maybe not. So then the price goes up to $500-$1000 and now most people can only buy 1-2 bitcoins or less. By then maybe there are so many people interested in bitcoins there still isn't enough to go around. Now the price is in the thousands. Now maybe the price is more steady as there is enough coins to go around. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:45:06
No. It'll just go unused. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 08:18:15
If you stick with bitcoins for years and the online gambling industry comes over to bitcoins and brings their billions of dollars with them then bitcoins could go over 9000. OVER 9000!!!! Hello early retirement.

@_date: 2013-03-11 08:20:05
I don't think it's too late. Bitcoin is still very young. I always wonder if all these people buying bitcoins one day will say, "I have $500 in bitcoins and it was a fun 2 months so I'm going to take my profit and get out of the game." If people keep seeing the price go up hopefully they won't cash out and more people join in so the price keeps going up. Right now all signs point to people holding and more people buying. Short term it is good but if people get bored and rather have their money in a bank account then sell. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:51:37
and if no one has a close friend or family member please contact me. I will make sure your bitcoins ends up in good hands.
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:01:06
That's my concern too. I am basically keeping my bitcoins on lock down cause I know once they are out of my control there may be no chance I get any back.
@_date: 2013-03-11 06:25:00
Bitcopia, Zipzap, BlueSkyTraders, Coinbase, Localbitcoins.com and a few others I'm forgetting.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:48:58
Usually it recovers some what before it comes all the way back down. It was too much work bringing it from $260 to $55. Now they will go $150 to $10.

Many people don't think so. You'll see when the price goes up over the next month.

Bought 7 more bitcoins at this high price. Come on $200.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:06:02
It should go up. I am putting $650 into bitcoins tomorrow before it goes up more.

It probably helped. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:23:37
Is a group of people selling and buying? Eventually this person or group selling will have millions to buy bitcoins again. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:36:47
I know some people who think it is a scam, I'll lose all my money and I won't be able to cash out on top so I better cash out now. Then a week later I let them know I'm up another thousand.

Bitcoins go up $100+
Litecoins go up and down $1-$2
If you don't want to make much money go with litecoins.
If you want to make money stick with bitcoins.
Use blockchain.info as your wallet and you'll be safe.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:46:13
I've been following btc-e chat. Kinda pissed I'm sitting on a bunch of bitcoins as I watch people make thousands on the other coins and then transfer back into bitcoins. It is a guessing game but I think I may try to make some more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:44:14
You can hook up a bank account and transfer the funds over.

Not too late. The deep pockets are just being briefed on bitcoins so assuming they put a percentage into bitcoins that'll add up to millions and we'll be over $200 in a month.

I think some people think bitcoins are not going to replace anything 100% so why bother. It will be good for internet things. Some web sites charge you to read their content. They can offer you 5 articles for 10 cents and let you pay in bitcoins. If you want a web site made, something done in photoshop you can pay in bitcoins. Say you are on craigslist and want to buy something and instead of bringing a couple hundred in cash you just tap phones and pay with bitcoins. 
Most people are not going to buy eggs, milk and bread with bitcoins unless you can tap your phone and pay with bitcoins at the cash register. 
Traveling, family members overseas. 
People that have a large sum of money that want to keep some in bitcoins incase they get in trouble with the government and the only money they have access to is what they can convert out of bitcoins. 
Bitcoins = new ideas. It won't replace one dollar bills.

Did it show up on your friends address?
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:22:13

@_date: 2013-04-04 03:19:39
I sent some bitcoins using the recommended fee via blockchain.info and some how the fee ended up being 0. So I have to select generous now and pay 12 cents or so everytime I send some coins.

Yes, but when you buy at $156 you are waiting and waiting and waiting :(
@_date: 2013-04-01 06:52:01
Mainly the thing we worry about is someone with a lot of coins cashing out and not enough demand to bring the price back up. Then other people sell and soon everyone is selling and with no buyers everyones coins are worthless. Right now though the demand is up and hopefully it stays that way and the price won't drop. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:51:15
It might be. Think bitcoin ATMs in airports. Before you leave you deposit your cash into bitcoins. You land and get the currency you need from the bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:04:37
As you probably have noticed it went up another $10 today. So no, not too late to invest. BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:03:54
I would change passwords / transfer out any bitcoins / litecoins or any other coin on that site. Never be too careful.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:35:50
Huge buy order. Price going over $1,000 once lag clears.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:28:12
The price may go down (large sell off) but you gotta basically be at your computer ready to buy 24/7 because bots will basically buy up all the cheap bitcoins and the price will be back to where it was before the large sell off. Most people are better off buying at $93 a bitcoin and wait for the price to go up. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:37:20
Have fun!
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:44:07
Because they figure they will buy back in when the price drops a few dollars...and if it doesn't...well jokes on them.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:45:21
Very nice. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:47:28
People are buying thousands of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:08:08
Everyone wants to think it will. It is world wide. Not going to end any time soon and the possibilities are endless. Demand is still high. I'm sure people are working on new ideas in which to incorporate bitcoins. There is a USA market for bitcoins opening up soon and people think there are people with large amounts of money waiting for that to open before investing in bitcoin. In 1-2 weeks lets see how high the price is and you can make a decision if you want to cash out with a little over a thousand or stay in and watch people throw more money into bitcoin and profit. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:22:26
A few thousand is my guess. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:46:48
1,000 x $141 = $141,000
Monthly expenses $1,000-$1,500
Live off bitcoins at current price for 7.8 years.
Say in 2 years you end up with 800ish bitcoins but now bitcoin price is $2,000.
Now you have $1,600,000 in bitcoins.
Continue trading bitcoins for cash.
Now you are in your 30's. You are renting a room in a house and paying the landlord in cash. Buying everything you need in cash. Basically off the governments radar. 
Say by the time you are 40 you still have hundreds of bitcoins. They are worth $10,000 now.
You have $6,000,000 in bitcoins. 
Now you are approaching 50. The price went up to $40,000 a bitcoin.
You now have $18,000,000 in bitcoins.
Continue trading bitcoins for cash. 
Now you want to take out more cash from bitcoins since you are nearing death and want to spend as much money as you can. 
All because you bought $30,000 worth of bitcoins in your 20's. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:12:08
There is all kinds of news that rich people will be putting large sums of money into bitcoin. The price could shoot up into the $1,000's. 
At $250 a bitcoin you could buy 8 with $2,000 and hope over time that turns into $10,000 to $20,000 to $30,000 and so on. 
The risk is people put in large amounts of money. They get rich. They take it back out. The market lags, people panic, people sell and then you try to sell and it is impossible and you just watch $50,000 go away as you can't take it out. 
It seems to be going up, it seems like it will keep going up. So far bitcoin has turned poor people who took out $30,000 loans into people that can cash out and have $200,000. 
It may not be too late for you. If you take the chance and bitcoin goes belly up then your life may be worse. Who knows though. Take a chance with $2,000 / 8 bitcoins and see where it takes you over the next couple months / rest of the year.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:59:50
Yes, this is the idea.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:11:13

I would say the bank but then you'll be on camera. So get a friend to deposit the cash into your bitcoin account.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:09:19
It would bring the price down to the $80's 
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:02:14

8,000 people waiting to be verified at Mt.Gox to buy coins. Many people waiting for coinbase to allow us to buy a lot of coins again. Many new people finding out about bitcoins and wondering if the price will drop or not and trying to figure out when to buy. Not many people selling because the price is going up. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:50:57
and I would try to buy one of those super computers from a person who preordered them. Once people get their preordered super computers everyone will be fighting for the small bitcoin pot and people won't get much money. But hey, you might make enough to pay off the super computer in a year and make a few bucks every year after that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:07:51
You can accept the bitcoins and sell them for fiat right away on an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:55:01
Coinbase lets you link up your bank account and transfer an amount of dollars you choose. Then in 3-6 days they take the money divided by the current price and deposit the bitcoins into your account. Then you can move them to your personal wallet.
Bitfloor lets you deposit money into a Bank of America account. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 03:46:18
Yeah, it is pretty ridiculous when you buy and a couple days later your wallet is a few thousand less.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:40:51
Just sits in the wallet forever. Unless someone in the year 2120 creates a super computer that can crack the passphrase.

Didn't see much of a drop this weekend. At $46 it is a very good buy. I bought more at $41 and thinking about buying another 8 at $46 before the start of the week. Should be another busy buying week. There are also 4,000 people waiting to be verified for MtGox which is up 1500 from a week or so ago. So more people looking to buy via MtGox and I'm guessing Coinbase too. Unless some major bitcoin holders decide to sell thousands then now is the time to buy.

Based on the price before the bubble started.

Hard to tell. Will people keep buying thousands of bitcoins everyday as the price goes up. 3600 new bitcoins a day.

Lets say you buy 7 bitcoins. The price jumps $20 and you sell. You made $140 which may or may not be a large amount to you. As a poor college uni student that may be lunch of a month. 
Where buying bitcoins really shines is when you buy thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins. That way if the price jumps $20 you made $2,000. Of course most people will keep their money in bitcoins expecting the price to go up as the demand out paces the amount of bitcoins there are. 
Of course you will hear both sides of the story saying if you buy thousands of dollars worth and bitcoin price crashes have fun withdrawing $1,000 out of bitcoins after putting $4,000 into bitcoins.

I wish I knew. I've bought and sold all my bitcoins twice now. Ugh

A bitcoin enthusiast posted on twitter about getting some rich people to possibly put millions into bitcoin which will jack the price up into the thousands. Buy 4 bitcoins today. Have that be worth over $10,000 later.

Hack someones account and steal their bitcoins. Set up a creative scam and have people unknowingly send bitcoins to you.

I'm sure people will buy up 5,000+ bitcoins and jack the price up to $66 and soon it'll be $70.
