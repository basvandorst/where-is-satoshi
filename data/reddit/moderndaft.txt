An idea is that value could be "unlocked", because competing interests don't need to keep burning resources fighting. Sort of like a mature company spinning out a subsidiary and unlocking additional market value.

Bitcoin Core supporters in general do not want 2 mb blocks (the 2x part of Segwit2x aka New York Agreement). BitPay supports Segwit2x. 
I tend to think the status quo of a small block chain and a big block chain (Bitcoin Cash) is preferable to another fork.

I'd prefer talking market cap. The market cap is laughably small at ~$80 billion USD. This can be explained to potential investors by comparing to a high net worth individual or relative to a Fortune 500 company. Market cap is a classic metric, and at least in a traditional finance, talking share price only is often a sign of lack of finance/valuation education (e.g. "penny stocks are cheap"). In contrast, the current price per coin intimidates people.
Tldr: Let's provide a bit of finance education by encouraging a focus on higher quality metrics. 
PS The per coin *is* useful for (low quality) media buzz.

It's supply and demand. "There will only be 21 million" is a popular refrain. If it's actually "there will be 21 million but 5 million are lost forever", that changes perceptions significantly. More generally, the money supply is a critical part of the field of economics. (eg Milton Friedman built his career on it)

You don't have to do anything. If your btc was from before Aug 1, you currently have Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. There may be another hardfork in November ("Segwit2x" aka "New York Agreement"), for which you'd receive a third forked coin. If there's a third fork, take a wait and see approach to transacting because it's unclear if the new fork will have "replay" protection, ie protection from a transaction on one chain erroneously also occurring on the other chain.

Market cap is not total buys and sells added together. It is most recent trade price x units outstanding.
"Market capitalization (market cap) is the market value at a point in time of the shares outstanding of a publicly traded company, being equal to the share price at that point of time times the number of shares outstanding."
This definition does not prohibit the idea that if someone sells 50% at once, the market cap could crash.

I'd say if you if you like the philosophical underpinnings of bitcoin, it doesn't follow that you need to like Facebook, particularly in its present form (e.g. politically biased manipulation of the newsfeed, or what some people would - mistakenly - call "censorship")
You point out some great innovations, but I don't see the utility - we could go back and and forth about prior innovations impacting bitcoin, including going really off track by pointing to government supported cryptography research and the wars that necessitated it.

Even though your example is designed to be over the top, I think most libertarians could hold their own in an ITT defending the standard leftist view of taxation, which most libertarians would regard as theft by a mugger. And given its usefulness in this context (to show libertarians understand leftists while the inverse is typically not true), I don't think your example discounts the usefulness of the ITT.


This is the kind of strawman argument ITT could potentially mitigate.
