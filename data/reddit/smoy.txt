Oh, my brain put a decimal in that wierd gap

Eth just passed 1 million transactions in a 24hr period and it is not having as much trouble as btc. There are still plenty of issues to solve. But btc is a special case of its own these days

Lol why the hell is Vitalik in there?? He doesn't belong  in it.

No, we havent been even remotely on the brink of war with either of them. Thats just a fantasy right there.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:14:33


Lol says the person whos friends feed him classified information, risking their livlihood so he can be one step ahead of the international intelligence agencies.
Who rants on internet forums about how we have been on the brink of world war. The person who thinks a president who cant even speak in coherent sentences with a vocabulary the size of an underdeveloped teenager. With a history of scamming people and not paying his contractors. thinks that that person can be believed to be helping the common person over his financal interests.Lol yep im the retarded one. Thinking trump is doing anything but enriching himself is really the most delusional part tho.


Like i said, countries bang their drums all the time. And as we are not at war. Shows this is meaningless

Thats a lot of articles but nothing of real substance. So Chinas first order a year ago was get ready for battle? Thats a whole year of a single standing order. Nothing has happened. 
And youre lucky you have a military friend whos willing to risk prison just to tell you a little secret. None of my military friends have told me anything about china.
But still, again, you wrote a lot out but theres nothing in there that is actual evidence of the things your claiming. Superpowers always bang on their drumbs and try to look scary. Its nothing new and it doesnt mean war. You should stop worrying yourself. The trade war isnt saving us. Its a ploy for the president to enrich himself and those who donated to him.
And the media thrives on fear. Its what they sell. Try reading a news article about something youre an expert on. See how incompetent they are. Then realize theyre just as incompetent on the topics you arent an expert on.

They need to take your Id in able to operate in all us states. It's not their choice. Voorhees issued a statement saying it's unfortunate but necessary under the law.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:50:26
Ok, i dont use trezor so I dont know about that one specifically. I feel that they are still obscure enough that if kept in a smart place they will hold your coins much more securely at a cheaper price point that a desktop or phone wallet. Considering 1% of people are into crypto, the thief would have to find it, know its valuable and not just a usb stick, then crack a pin or find the physical vulnerability all before its patched, which it already was. That seems less likely than someone keylogging, or stealing a phone or its info from someone.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:08:37
This is awesome news. It is disappointing to hear from the naysayers that this is bad news just because Vorhees owns shapeshift. I bet everyone here uses a service somewhere where they disagree with the politics of the owners. Google, facebook, apple, the US dollar, just a few that come to mind.
It's amazing that you don't have to trust an exchange with my personal info or being hacked anymore. You can just exchange right in your hardware wallet, safest way around.

But they are still employed by the government. When the government directs them to do x, they do it. And they get paid to do it.

There are billions of people on this planet. 95 million vs 21 million is a minor difference comparatively. If mass adoption happens, every American would still not be able to own 1. So you might be right. But if bitcoin is 10million and eth is 2 million who cares at that point, if you're here now.

I completely agree, I feel like the bitcoin i bought into in 2013 is dead and not dead like the media always says, but the world wide overthrow of the banksters revolution- that is dead- banks won. Bitcoin is western union now. Venmo is better to use now. Its all very sad to see, it could be revived but it seems this is the time to start looking towards more promising crypto projects
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:16:26
Yeah, but I dont have to pay a fee to use my credit card..... Bitcoin is supposed to be better than banks. It used to be. Now its def not better than Venmo and on par with Western Union.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:17:14
if youve been around the bitcoin community for any length of time you know that setting up weekly buys of 20-50 $ is very common

So what would saying "Iraq is stock piling weapons of mass destruction" be considered?
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:08:59
The news was fabricated. If the media didn't fabricate it then the government did. So the basis is still fake news.

Don't forget "Iraq is hoarding weapons of mass destruction"
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:10:19

@_date: 2019-10-23 14:16:13
So no one should be using lightning is what im gathering from this statement? Because who would think a loss of any btc would be acceptable
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:10:56
I have plenty of savings, but losing btc for no reason, even 1 sat is unacceptable to me. Its also sad to see this statement, considering this whole venture and block size debate was so that people in developing nations could stay on. Yet the sentiment now seems to be theyre too poor to use btc.
Theres a big difference between having a few hundred dollars worth of btc changing value and that amount of btc just disappearing
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:21:47
they are alternatives to each other
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:54:21

So, youre saying the poster is lying?
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:19:19
theres 2 different topics going on here.


neither of these are called "alt" OS's. Alt coin is a silly notion
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:37:47
What communism are you talking about. Are you saying public schools and firefighters are communist?
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:17:55
Ok sure. 
There are many bitcoins now tho. Its confusing to say just bitcoin and expect people to just know what you're talking about. It's like saying I want to buy a Ford. Ok...which model?
What I'm saying is that Core is just the main chain. Since gold is already taken. And btc has moved to being digital gold. It makes sense now to call the main/core btc as core.
As for the term alt coin. I feel its outdated. All coins are just crypto now.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:55:28
Its. It something for nothing. Amazon and 50 other billion dollar companies pay no tax. This is there tax. And instead of it going to the government it goes to the people.
You keep calling it communsit. I want to know how you reconcile that a deep red state already has UBI. So how does the GOP recon with the fact they already have universal basic income and their governor and people love it.
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:44:14
Yeah, do research yourself. Its just funny the way they say it. Sounds contradictory.
Btw can i see the link to your banned post?
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:02:10
Eh idk if its roger ver. I know this sub likes to make him out as a boogey man but as far as I can remember bitcoin and core have always been synonymous with each other.
As far as calling it bitcoin core. Well that just makes sense. Theres so many bitcoins out there now none of them can just be called bitcoin. It's not descriptive enough. Unfortunately bitcoin gold is already taken, since that seems to be what btc is head for. So core makes sense. I highly doubt its purpose is to be deceptive.
On the other hand, from the sidelines, it is pretty funny to see people get upset about being called core when it's just using the same tactic they tried to use on the bch camp way back when
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:51:36
Yeah some are def scams. But they're all bitcoins. Especially if they were forked.
As for alt coins, I hate to break this to you but it's just a silly word. An alt coin is any coin except bitcoin. Theres nowhere else that we name things like that, by excluding the first. Websites are website, not alt websites, cars are cars, not alt cars. Bitcoin was the first but that doesnt give it a special defenition, or make all others a different definition, it's all crypto.
I dont mean this in a negative but this fascination with the term alt is purely within a super small nerd community. I dont mean nerd in a bad way cuz I was totally apart of it so many years ago. But the rest of the world doesnt see alt coins. They see crypto and to make an artificial definition of just one crypto on one side and literally all the others on the other is just silly. We can always say bitcoin was the first. But theres no line between any of them
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:04:36
So from a quick googling it looks like bitcoin core is btcc.
Probably an old vestige from btc being called core so much. They should really update their site. I'd guess you'd be buying btc from the look of that transaction. But they need to make it crystal clear.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:47:23
Whats the problem here? Looks like you can buy both coins
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:36:13
then what is the btc ticker? is bitcoin core a fork I missed?
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:14:32

Is btc not bitcoin anymore?
BCH and BTC are the top two most popular bitcoins. Unless you're suggesting coinbase and gemini are also scamming people. Then I understand your pov at least
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:52:26
Sure, so when we talk about eth then that means btc is an alt coin tho. That's what I'm saying, the term doesnt really make sense. I dont care in particular what is called what. I'm just saying from a language perspective it doesnt make sense.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:04:36
Yang is the only one likely to embrace crypto and get us the tax laws we need on it.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:52:38
Well you clearly havent listened to yang, because hes not proposing giving people something for nothing. But i find it odd that you think its ok for billion dollar companies to not have to pay for those services but we do.
And with this claim your also saying the very conservative state of alaska is communist, because they already have universal basic income
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:47:14
Lol idk if you're not understanding what Im saying but alt coin is a silly convention and also the only one one of its kind in all language. The history of crypto is 10 years old. Naming and categorizing things is much older. So im asking you to tell me any other thing that has different name from the rest of its kind just for being the first one. I cant think of any. 
Is your computer an alt computer if its not Microsoft? 
Theyre all crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:06:24
Lol no bitcoin gold, bitcoin cash, bitcoin whatever, forks from the chain are all bitcoins. All of them are crypto. 
The word alt coin is meaningless tho. Can you name a single other thing that we differentiate the first one from all the rest through a whole other word to describe it? Alt airplanes and bi-plane?
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:40:25

 I haven't been paying attention to the space in a long time. But last time I was the whole reason we stayed with small blocks was so every person who wanted to run a node could do so. Especially in less developed countries. This was also a part of combatting centralization.

What state has a 15$ minimum wage? Some are raising theirs but it will be implemented over the next 5 or so years. Also you didnt include income tax in your equation. 15* 40* 4=2400 - (2400*.25) = 1800, so yeah, maybe if they dont eat, clothe their kids and stop paying all bills. But still even NY is only at $11 minimum wage
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:39:21
I don't think you can get interested in bitcoin without at least one of the 3 criteria.

B. Distrust of the government/banking cartels
C. lots of money to speculate on things with
Also, dont try to disparage our fellow revolutionaries
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:12:16

If there's anything iv learned in business, it's that the customer is usually adamant about what they want, but also have no fucking clue what they're really asking for. I doubt most coinbase users know enough about this tech to really make an informed decision. I know I don't and I read about this stuff constantly. Let them have their fork and evetyone quit bitching, sell you BCC if you don't want it and you never have to think about it again

@_date: 2017-07-25 22:45:51
No ethereum is fine. They these findings are for moving forward, they aren't prosecuting anything that's already happened.
Anyway, The info put out by the SEC doesn't really go into what properties an ICO must have to qualify as a security. All it says is some ICOs are securities and the The DAO token was. As far as I remember The DAO token was not a protocol token, you didn't have to do anything special to get dividends. Ether is used to pay gas fees, so it is probably fine.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:34:00
The SEC specifically called out eth and said they were not going to do anything about it. This ruling is specifically about moving forward
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:51:12
How about a nice crisp $5, $10 or $20 though? How would you like change for this hundred? We can give you 5 .2's, 10 .1's or 2 .5's? Id rather have 10mBTC
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:10:20
There is no expected or promised return of investment when buying Eth.
In case you need the definition of a security "A security is a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity's bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option."
Eth is not a stake of ownership in any organization nor does it pay dividends. This is all just FUD
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:59:52

Your really think Coinbase and Gemini, two exchanges that pride themselves on being regulated, would be selling illegal securities?
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:23:06
Yeah, but they HF to return everyone's money. So its not exactly the same as "protecting" the security.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:01:14
Yes it was an ICO, but again, it is not a DAO, from the SEC "regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).."
Ethereum is a platform, a decentralized virtual machine that uses ether to run. Ether is not a stake in a company or the Ethereum Foundation.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:42:06
It can be an ICO without being a DAO. 
" They directly profited from the release of a security that they invented and controlled. " 
Didn't Satoshi pre-mine 1 million btc? and if he's still alive has he not profited from the great invention that is Bitcoin? Considering the IRS says crypto is property we could say yes.  I guess the government will have to find a place to draw its line. But anyway, this statement was specifically about DAO, which eth is not, and each ICO may or may not be a security depending on its individual case
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:26:25

It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity's bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option."

Regardless, the Ethereum Foundation lawyered up before deciding to offer the ICO to Americans, so more than likely they covered their bases

I am serious, where in the ethereum white paper does it say that buyers can expect the value of the coins to grow or receive dividend payouts?
Secondly no, the SEC did not say ICO's are securities, they said "Some ICOs MAY be securities based on an individual basis". read the article

Ethereum is not a stake in anything, its gas for a network, they are quite different.

The SEC Bulletin linked in the article
"Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities.  If they are securities, the offer and sale of these virtual coins or tokens in an ICO are subject to the federal securities laws."

Your really think Coinbase and Gemini, two exchanges that pride themselves on being regulated, would be selling illegal securities?
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:27:41
Haha np, i tried to be vague enough to cover everyone
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:48:24
I'm very confident that US based regulated exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase wouldn't be selling an illegal security. If it is, im sure they'll drop trading any day now because trading and selling securities not licensed with the SEC is a felony.

Also not all ICOS are DAO. Coins used for transaction on networks are not considereal a part of this as far as I know
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:15:48
Eth is not DAO, eth is a token used for transaction on the Ethereum network, its a utility token, its used as gas, not a share in something like DAO
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:48:34
It is because the US exchanges would be violating securities law
edit: selling securities that are not registered with the SEC is a felony
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:25:37
profits are not the only factor, you also need to be able to vote on decisions made by the organization (DAO)
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:04:55
Its not the only data that factors in. But considering I was replying to a very general comment of "what percentage of people outside of China" it suffices to say that a small % of the population of china can measure very large against other countries.

Can someone clarify for me why this is up to BCC? If it's possible to fork bitcoin and attack the original chain why are we leaving it up to the attackers to defend us? Shouldn't segwit be taking steps to defend itself, rather than telling the fork "you guys need to write code that defends us"
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:24:40
You do know there are a ton of coins with the name bitcoin in them right? On a side note, why's everyone so butthurt over this. This is literally a feature of bitcoin, where if you can't agree you fork and let the market decide.

Excuse me sir but do you own Internets? Looks like we'll have to cavity search you..
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:28:37
Where did they state that buying eth would give you a stake in the company, voting right, or increased fiat value?

I'm hoping it's the "we are all more stupid after hearing you speak"
