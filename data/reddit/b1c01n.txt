THIS. Don't listen to these morons who don't even have the slightest clue what coinbase is. Buy at an exchange where you can see the bid/ask, set limit orders, get instant fills. etc. 


Are there publicly traded bitcoin related companies? 
Also, if OP wants to sink that much money into bitcoins, he can look into the bitcoin fund that secondmarket started or wait til the bitcoin etf comes online.

When I inquired about publicly traded bitcoin related companies, I was referring to bitcoin related companies that had their shares listed on a public stock market...

As opposed to the shills at the BRITISH broadcast company. All news/media is propaganda and controlled by the government.

It doesn't look like a public stock market. It looks like a bullshit investment fund. 


So you should have just written no in your first comment.

Billion or million. The point still stands goofy.


Wow. Dividends consistently paid for a whole 6 months. Amazing. With such a track record, I'll borrow as much money as I can and dump it into this scam.


HAHAHA. And I'm done with you...

No you worthless cockroach. Learn the difference between a FUND COMPANY and a MARKET. Do you know what the difference between fidelity and the NYSE is? Fucking moron.


I wasn't asking about funds that "buy" stocks in bitcoins. I can buy funds, stocks, etc on my own. I am talking about companies in a bitcoin business that make money off of idiots like you. That's what I was asking for. Not your scammy "fund" company.


Such as? 


No it is not you dumb fuck.


Except that companies pay dividends in cash/stock. And if I wanted bitcoins, I would use my dividend to BUY bitcoins. It's idiotic to add the extra layer.


No shit moron. And that's why you should've say "no" in the original comment instead of peddling you worthless scam fund company. 
Holy shit bitcoin has its share of scammers and scumbags.

A fund company that creates the funds and is the sole market maker of the funds they created. Amazing. There's plenty of morons on reddit so your fund should do well scamming morons.


HAHAHAHAHAHA. It gets even better. A "mining company" with a 2.3 billion dollar market cap. Wonderful...


From your shitty website...
Last Dividend	No dividend has been paid
Next Dividend	N/A


No. But you referred to a bullshit scam site when I did not ask for it. So you can fuck off. Garbage like you should be found and gutted alive. Worthless parasite scum.
