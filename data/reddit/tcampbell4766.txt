What about the use of Bitcoin substitutes, such as money substitutes in the US banks?

If bitcoin's are like cash, they must overcome the same hurdles as cash.  Cash is not used as often as credit/debit cards.  If bitcoin cannot take the next step, it will never progress beyond online drug merchants.

I like this idea, a full reserve would be easier to start and give confidence to account holders.  CD's could be used to generate revenue.  Is this how banks such as Flexcoin turn a profit?  I'm curious how they make money.

This has nothing to do with fractional reserve banking! And hardly even to do with Bitcoin.

I like this idea, hedging, but what about the possibility of just loaning out bitcoins with a contract?  The only obstacle I've thought of in the loaning aspect is the anonymity.  But this is not an obstacle with the proper contracts in place, no?

The problem I see facing the future of the currency is the fact it is mostly being held for investment.  But in my research on the US banking system, some specialists say that fractional reserve banking is inevitable once a currency hits a stable trading price (ie is no longer an investment because the price hardly swings).
