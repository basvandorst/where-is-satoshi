Honestly I'd pushed this out of my range of concerns.  
In the span of 71 days (2 months and 1 week or so) you're still on this?  
  
Your point and argument is meaningless to things I have as focal points now. You didn't show understanding of blockchain tech and that I still stand by. It's pretty telling, given your latest reply and time frame of my last message to you, that you're still stuck on this.

No doubt! I respect things like this, as it feels genuine and not shilling. Good luck* on your business too man!  
  
question, you all planning on offering crypto giftcards? (*I know that sounds odd, but the idea I had was you'd need a coder who would setup a smart contract which constantly kept enough coin on any one particular giftcard at the Pound equivalent. so for example, say a 10 pound gift card is 100 RandomChain coins on monday, but come tuesday 100 randomChain coins is now worth 20 pound, the smart contract would simply automatically remove 50 RandomChain coins out of that wallet associated with the giftcard and boom! still a 10 pound card. I might be thinking too out-there lol.*)

I mean technically speaking, I personally (operative word) do not understand why a blockchain dev or dev group would promote lite clients over full nodes. To the user(s) who said that, that’s why I’m responding in the manner I am. It’s logically not sound

No true, a blockchain is only secured by majority of nodes outpacing bad nodes. Its trustless so size and distribution do not factor into security in the straight forward sense your post alludes to

So to clarify, during tomorrows POK event, nothing should be lost or stolen. If any funds dont publish to the blockchain during the event its suspected the exchange in question is doing funny business.  
  
Having your coins in Mycelium (considered a hotwallet) or in paper storage (considered a coldwallet) means you have absolute ownership of your coins and keys. Having coins on exchanges or coinbase means that that exchange or site has your keys. So hypothetically speaking, if i have Your keys to your coins then technically I own the coins until you request moving of coins or sell them

@_date: 2019-01-02 18:38:43
as much as I'd hope this be the case I think it won't.  
before taking my break from crypto I began using and loving the idea of decentralized exchanges but there are a few things I dislike about them and I think will see these DEX's being a niche thing.  
  
the ability to sell your coins for way under market value, yea I dig it - we should all be knowledgeable on this and how to sell correctly but new users don't. and I seen postings (months ago) where someone either sold their coin for way under market value or bought for way over market value, thinking DEX's had stop loss like Kucoin or other exchanges have.  
  
another issue is that individuals would have to learn how to properly move and store their coins. and yea, some of us want to know how to do this, but majority of new crypto heads (I've personally ran into) didn't care about the science or the how-to's, they just heard this is where the money is and they want it.  
  
DEX's are beautiful, but they are also painfully slow (compared to non-dex). which is another thing that I personally believe will turn off new users to them.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:04:35
that makes no sense though. the main important factor is to secure the blockchain, aka incentivize (if possible) the act of securing the chain to promote more positive nodes than negative nodes and prevent a 51% attack.  
  
running lite nodes vs. full has **absolutely shit** to do with "Decentralization". also, the "Easier updates" claim is bogus and bullshit as well. "No scalability problems" lmao, what the fuck are you even saying?

so to make this easily understood, you aware of what a bank-run is?  
  
in essence, all members of the bank withdraw their entire account holdings all at once. the issue with this is banks don't keep but a certain amount of cash (in bill form and coins) on hand while the rest is used to invest with and what not. but since it's not seen as being a major potential, banks don't worry about bank-run's too much and they will just deny you the chance to withdraw your money if they suspect one taking place.  
  
same model, but with crypto.  
where as in crypto the owner of the keys = owner of the coin, exchanges hold these keys for us when we trade our coin on their platform. so in essence, we could be hypothetically trading nothing and this is where the Proof of Keys comes into play. so the point of POK is to do a bank run with crypto on all exchanges.  
  
it's suspected that the exchanges are doing what the banks do, they keep only a certain amount of coins on exchange to satisfy withdrawals. but if the entire userbase withdraw all BTC at once, they (people promoting this) believe it's going to show that exchanges move our coins out of our exchange wallets and into theirs for whatever reason in essence, taking ownership of keys they don't have proper ownership of (if that makes sense).  
  
here's a quote,  


  


  
tl;dr = it's to force the exchanges to show what they do with our coins when we send it to the exchange wallets.

I really wished this was done by all investors (big and small) but for some reason, I think majority of the people who invest in crypto but don't fully understand it's technology won't do this out of reason of not knowing what to do exactly.

There isn’t an official list but there are a ton of dedicated investigators who track down wallets, wallet history and potential owners. It would take me sometime but digging, im sure i could find some.  
  
And its easy to track what wallets belong to individuals and what wallets belong to exchanges. I forget the exact *how*. And yea they are publicized but not in the manner you and I are speaking upon. Every address on a blockchain by design could be searched by anyone with a net connection, this very reason is why such protocols such as “Wraith” was created and released, to add a level of anonymity to crypto transactions but word had it (from write ups i’d seen last year) wraith was as anonymous as it initially promoted itself as

Lol I’m really going to just say You’re trolling at this point.

So if you all think I’m going to be like “Yea that makes sense”, be disappointed and be ready to smash that downvote button.  
  
It’s insane to even argue you believe lite client over full client is a better option for the blockchain overall stability and health.

but that's the thing, as an exchange you should be upfront and clear about where you move funds to. or you should have security that allows for customers to keep their coins on site. I understand your argument and agree to a certain degree.  
  
DEXs were (from memory) becoming really popular in 2018 when things were a little crazy. left and right I kept seeing white papers claiming to be the latest and greatest in Decentralized exchanging lol. honestly the only DEXs I can honestly say I've had no issue using is EtherDelta, and ForkDelta. but it takes some getting use to because unlike CEXs, DEXs you sometimes have to enter in smart contract address, decimal points and ticker name. which isn't hard information to locate but if you're not familiar with DEXs they might piss you off the first few times using them.  
  
also, there is no stop loss on DEXs (last time I used them) meaning, if I'm willing to buy 100 coins of say RedditCoin for 1.00 a coin, but you mistakenly sell 10,000 RedditCoins for 0.01 a coin and I snatch that up, you just lost a shit load of money and no one is going to try and return/refund that to you. lol, I've seen stories of people spending way more than they wanted to on a coin because they thought they were putting in a stop/loss or future buy order.
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:50:56
And that’s my point, logically for any chain (and to be clear I am not sure if the users claiming this is true or not) to promote lite clients in the context of them being better than full nodes is ludicrous. As you’ve answered, these simple tasks can be completed* via a full client **and** the added bonus, running a full node = added network security where as lite nodes don’t add security.  
  
I really hate it’s taking this long to get to this point

I understand, it's just man - maybe I do take shit way too personal but I can't begin to properly express my negativity towards these exchanges and bad actors. HitBTC freezing accounts before POK event is just more proof of why events like this is required and should be practiced by all parties but yes, saving coins on exchanges = quicker execution of trades = potentially more profit. but these exchanges and bad actors just make me not trust no one involved. and I dig it, trustless system, yada yada yada but let's be 100% real here... Satoshi's original vision is but a relic now. and more and more this system is utilizing 3rd party members (trusted 3rd party might I add) for all things.  
  
it's as if they read satoshi's vision and paper and decided to do the exact opposite of what he warned against and taught. shit pisses me off more than it should probably.

Legit question, why would anyone suggest **not** running a full node?
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:05:46
Yea, I get called stupid and dumbasses too online. especially in sections dealing with IT and technology, as a self-proclaimed nerd/geek, we tend to expect people to know what we know. it's a asshole trait shared amongst us, I try to not speak down towards no one when answering a question because I hate to be talked down to. but lol, yea unfortunately that's the nature of the techie crowd, we think we're more important than we really are lmao.  
  
and like you, I too took a break. during 2018 when things were just red all over, i left about a couple hundred bucks of altcoins in an wallet and checked on it from time to time, I've lost just about 80% of it's value during these times so I've been out of the loop as well and just starting to dip my feet back in the pool.  
  
Now let me give some devils advocate answer to your moving question. honestly, and I've said this before, I think everyone should focus on this as the implications are massive for everyone involved. but being in your shoes, I wouldn't want to scare you into moving and messing up or anything.  
  
although I personally feel everyone should jump on board this, you have to weigh this option for yourself. as I've said, I believe in this but I too have kept coin on exchanges to capitalize on any profit. if you aren't doing anything but waiting it out hoping to see increase in investment, honestly - I'd say leave it on coinbase. but if you feel this crypto thing is deeper than just a new money system and want to participate, I'd say give me some time to research and get back caught up on things and then I can suggest a cold-storage method for you. but right now off the top of my head, my knowledge is old and I don't feel comfortable telling you how to move coin with old methods.  
  
And to the should you sell or hodl question, this is very touchy and if you ask 10 of us you will likely get 10 different answers. I don't ever feel safe telling someone to sell or hodl, because you have to remember that at the end of the day, your profit is the bottom-line.

Being able to check your balance and submit transactions can **only** be done with Lite clients?
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:33:57
But see this is why that argument is not logical,  
If you don’t have enough positive nodes to maintain consensus of approved transactions, then what’s the point in promoting lite clients? You’re in essence (by promoting lite over full) promoting low security.  
  
But again, this whole question line was started by someone saying low popularity and low ranking in market cap is what was the vector point for the 51% attack (which for any newcomers is absolute bullshit)

@_date: 2019-01-09 12:16:34
(Serious question)  
I'm being sincere when I ask this, but isn't it truly better to run a full node? I understand the reason for hashing being done on specialized devices but I feel as though, if you truly claim to be a proponent for this technology *(forget the wider economic factor, forget the political implications, forget the social ramifications for a second)* then wouldn't it be in your best interest to run a full node in order to help actually contribute *(and I mean no disrespect or snark by asking that)* to the ecosystem of the tech as a whole?  
  
I'm in the process of studying for A+ cert, I plan on also learning up on mining. once I get the appropriate knowledge, and financial means, I plan on building my own rig for a coin I believe in. yea, if the mining aspect is incentivized then it'll be a bonus, but if it isn't incentivized *(ex. IOTA - unless they've changed last time I'd been keeping up with them)* then I'll still feel like I'm gaining something in the long run.  
  
All in all, my entire argument yesterday and still today is the following,  
**Yea, it does cost** *(time, effort and money)* **to build a mining rig. One has to seriously be interested in the technology and the way the technology functions. all of this is hard work,** *but* **if anyone reading this feels this technology** *(again, disregard all the other elements such as wide scale economic effects, political implications and social ramifications for a second)* **is worth it, then running anything other than a full node should strictly be reserved for those individuals who absolutely cannot contribute to the mining of a blockchain due to either regional issues involving lack of technology advancements and costs to purchase said equipment, or your country is under an oppressive regime which limits internet connectivity outside its borders, etc. but for individuals such as You and Myself, who live in a nation where we have access to not only the knowledge and online communities to help answer questions, but also the tech - then we should be always trying to run full nodes. The bottom line is we are all key players in this, because this is a group consensus thing. we don't need to trust each other as the system is designed to not only reward positive participation but it helps identify potential negative participation and can even punish them for it** *(I remember reading about one chain which would take the coins from a bad actor trying to double spend, I forget the name of the chain)*.  
  
So, although my stance isn't one looked upon with accepting eyes - It's one I sincerely feel is important and something which should be at least heard. Because think about this, say we all adopt the mindset you have and say ***"well if you're not paying me to do so, heh"*** then you know who will pick up and run a full node? Big companies and entities, with a goal in mind that doesn't include us, the little people. so if we don't run full nodes, and control the way this evolves from our active positive participation - then when the Goldman Sachs's, when the Rockefeller's, or the next deep pocket whale shows up with their own agenda and end up fucking up a chain, we can't be mad.

Yea, and not to come across like a dick but if you hit google and type in searches like "Hunt for Satoshi's real identity" or "who is Satoshi" you will be greeted with a wealth of different theories, ideas, etc.  
  
When Satoshi name was first becoming known it was through message forums and mailing-lists where he was promoting his philosophy to the masses. people have been digging since Bitcoin first was became popular (outside of techie groups and the dark web).  
  
as of today, 03.January.2019 there have been claims of people who say they are Satoshi but have never shown proof, people think they have pinpoint who Satoshi is. one wild theory even suggests Satoshi is a combination of Asian companies hell bent on seeking world domination through this new currency medium.

Hmmm “but why are you suspicious?” They said, oh and “FUD, unfounded! Nonsense!” When I said I didn’t trust them.  
  
������ knew they were up to no good  
  
**Edited to address downvotes:** that’s right shills, downvote me all you like. Tether is having its skirt blown up over it’s head, and hopefully majority of the sphere rejects the use of USDT in **any** and **all** formats. Downvote all you like, proof speaks louder than shilling ������ so glad to finally have some information to prove the bullshit Tether has been pulling.

Once you move your crypto from a exchange or 3rd party seller such as Coinbase you get the keys for the coins in your hot wallet or cold wallet. If your accounts read zero on coinbase then you will not have to deal with them if you choose not to

I don't consider myself stupid but when Crypto was prime for making profits, I definitely kept my coins on exchanges to take advantage of windows of opportunity. so I don't think it's "stupid" to keep coins on exchanges, **BUT** for what this day can potentially bring and mean for all of us investors (that being, the exposure of bad acting exchanges) I am in 110% support of everyone moving their tokens and coins into private wallets or cold storage and let's see how these exchanges handle the liquidity request of a large (hopefully all) portion of their users.  
  
would crash alot of shit tier (but beautiful UI built) exchange sites.

Yea see that’s how I’m thinking, before I praise quantum computing (in relation to crypto) I need to ensure Quantum will “play nice” first lol

well it's obvious you know your stuff, you made a year prediction that came to past. so I'm not pressuring you, I'll just be a fly on your profile's wall lol

~~just hearing of this, let me read up on this and give my answer.~~  
I'm interested in this,  
all my crypto is off exchanges but just to pull the dresses up over these bad actors, I'm supporting this.

no shock,  
that bullshit ass "OMG let us investigate insider trading" story that broke with Bitcoin Cash.  
  
Bunch of fucking money hungry, grubby shady actors in the game.

the most important aspect I was hinting at was the ability for Quantum to potential launch a 51% attack on any network without 51% of the network working with it. basically I'm in fear that without Quantum protected blockchain (and that in itself is a paradox as you can't make Quantum protection on non-quantum systems) blockchains can be easily attacked.  
  
that's my whole fear of them, but I understand what you're saying.

Honestly I think the FedCoin is being worked on for the just Incase scenario of a fiat collapse (that’s my feelings anyways)
