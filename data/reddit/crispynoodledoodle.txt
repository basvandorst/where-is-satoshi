Haha, one article crypto is dead and then this... laughable news
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:45:18
Yeah I heard it on Coronation st. Some chump called Ryan purchased some Whipcoin "whooopish" back in 2011 to spend on the dark web. He had a massive 5 coins and his mate told him it's worth 250k so he starts to shit his pants and can't find his password to some shoddy exchange. After much bollocks, he remembers it suddenly whilst having a poo. He hurriedly logs off before logging on only to discover it's not worth much. I've only seen a bit of it but it was demonized from the start, I wouldn't be surprised to discover this story ends badly and is a smear on crypto.

Nice work my friend... I like it 
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:50:16
I am more of the opinion that anything could happen! Previous trends suggest a long road ahead but I also feel quite optimistic despite the red candles and never ending dips. 
I'm 35 and know no other (not online) person that "still" holds crypto. Agreed stomachs need to be tough. I agree that many milenials don't have either the money or guts to get in. 
I started buying Bitcoin at 8k and continued past 15k briefly. More recently I've been nipping up a bit more but the wife is not pleased. 
I am speculative and here for some gains. This has not been the case but despite being down currently, I feel I've learned tons and wow has it captured my attention. 
If nothing else, I've enjoyed learning about currency as a whole and I see better the world we live in. I'll keep hold of my bit and bobs and see what happens next...

@_date: 2018-08-12 20:28:59
I'm only 5k down... compared to many others, this seems like very little!
@_date: 2018-08-16 19:35:54
Done, hope this helps... I would have completely written my dissertation on crypto had it been around.

You gotta be in the right place at the right time and brave like a bull. Trade. You'll lose limbs daily and weekly. Never marry a crypto. Take your gains. Keep moving and follow your gut instinct. Check crypto every hour. Pray for 10x always. Have no emotions. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:32:47
Fear sell!
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:48:32
So what Crypto did you buy today then?
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:05:49
Yes, Yes it is. I'm here for the tech obvs

This is all sounding very DOGE! 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:19:44
Really...  you embody everything I dislike about this community! Show some support ffs 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:10:38
Withdraw the lot and give it to charity. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:38:42
Thanks so very much. You've restored my faith today. Good luck to you too
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:55:49
I'll take your advice and study... do you have any good sources for info?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:07:37
I'm the same as you... Dec 17! We timed our entry real badly and have had to learn the hard way. I've lost significant amounts now and I'm  losing crypto confidence entirely.  I've made very few good trades and in hindsight, wish I had not bought into the fomo! 
I know what you mean about the quality of others responses.  I've had a lot of cocky responses from "alleged" profit guys but I doubt they have managed to keep their folio intact. The mood generally is a bit pathetic and I've found a serious lack of support when asking questions. People seem determined to chastise us newcomers as weak or dumb, but we are the new money that crypto needs! I've plenty to invest but why on earth would I repeat  this experience. 
Crypto is not replacing my bank account or solving any major issues for me. My friends and family are 'told you so' about it all. I've not met one person who has any crypto! The press have banned it's advertising, the tax is one way,  it's littered with scammy crap. 
Like you, I won't sell but im equally not putting any more into this shit storm. I'm embarrassed that I got suckered in. I wish you the best of luck and hope things pick up for all of us in this space.

Its laughable how many times religion has been used to justify all sorts of shit over the years. No wonder we are in a world of confusion now! The powers globally really have divided and conquered themselves into a deep mystery. Crypto is a refreshing and critical environment where such things have no bearing.

No problem, just sharing the material I've been gifted with after asking similar questions for the last 12 months ��
@_date: 2018-11-13 11:08:00
Yeah, massively good point!  I guess you would have to prove that it was a gift somehow. Show a papertrail of funds and prove the intent. It shouldn't be that way but if my Ozzie mates send me 50k BTC, here in the UK I'd have to pay tax on withdrawal or argue the toss with the tax man. 
I'd anticipate a withdrawal fee from coinbase as that's my only known / used option right now
It would be a nightmare scenario for me, self employed so justifying funds on the word of it!!!! Bollocks, I reckon they'd tax the shit out of me. The US appears to have it worst, anyone from  Murica 
@_date: 2018-11-13 11:38:39
With KYC we're all hemmed in and at the mercy of our local tax police.  If we start sending and receiving international funds the men in black cars will surely come see us!!! The story above smells like a one off use case perfect outcome. 
I can't see beyond my personal scenario of... 
My bag of red candles alts yeah. If they went 100x in a minute, I'd trade it to BTC but I wouldn't consider withdrawal. E.g. BTC is a one way street. I would then focus my attention on paying for a life with BTC. The end... moral, never withdrawal BTC

70% of French people yellow vest ...is it really that many?  I was caught up recently in their protests and they sure are determined, I witnessed some crazy sights! I'm not sure they can do much but ruin the French economy here though. Are they burning the euro now? I don't sse them affecting it as a whole but maybe if the movement got major traction Europe wide it could. Our UK news showed some pretty messy images of yellow vests wrecking a museum and lost any support this end. We're fighting our own stupid battles anyway...

Many won't admit it but I've had to take some steps recently. I use my tablet only and leave it at home daily. I've the ability to check on my phone but I've logged out of the exchange (auth is on my tablet) so I can not interfere or stress about it. I've an appalling track record but I've curbed it, I have probable checked it 20 times since getting home... hmmm 
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:48:39
That's because all we have seen is horrid banking practise for many decades from global players. Banks are out to profit from us.... they just sell debt products to the vulnerable. And protection from scammers... ok, maybe using a visa card is ok but there is no protection but common sense. 
I'm not out to hate banks, but they seem uneccecariy if we just learn to live within our means. You know what I mean....

So do you have to disclose every trade? Surely beyond coinbase (or simmilar) they could never trace the game play in exchanges and wallets?

I imagine that the state officials own most (all) banks and shit their pants at the prospect of a better alternative for the people. It's precisely these economies where I imagined crypto to have the most impact and become useful. What a shame you cant play the game! Or can you....

@_date: 2018-12-05 12:07:34
Does this happen in an automated system? Surely we can use our standard fiat cards in a new way here... Buying just a small amount of a crypto at the very point of sale? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:10:43
In the case of retail, we buy the relailer a bit of crypto. Here you go... received, done. Now take my good or service. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:03:30
I figured they'd just threaten you with withdrawal of sevice in an instant. For most small businesses this would prove highly problematic for trade. We should go back to promise paper, at least you get something to keep you warm on the fire at the very end!
