Ha! Me! Single, female who makes financial content to teach teens/young adults on how to not fuck themselves with bad student loans, like I sadly did. And, teach them how to invest early, like I am finally doing!! :)
PS you're obviously amazing. It's my dream to be able to help those in need like you are doing, one day. Stay golden!!!

A year before Bitcoin was created, a woman named Margaret Runchey patented the “Semantic Model of Everything Recorded” which features an insane chain of ownership (blockchain) which “allows for assets, smart contracts and miners to secure the network to all play their role in the Model is Everything” the patent even talks about offline wallet addresses.
Most of the story is in the description here:

Most likely, no. Since it's the IRS I assume it's for people who have cashed out. IRS wants money on gains.
