Shift isn't available in my state. Hopefully Wagecan will work. I'm fine with it converting on the spot. 
Do they ever ask for social security  They seem kind of shady.

From my bank account.

Thanks for the response. Have you used them? Are they legit? I searched them on reddit and can't find much.

Just because it's "more than an alt coin" doesn't make it not an alt coin.

Don't count on it hitting $1k. Not saying it won't, but I would not invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:00:54
Tl;dr: No one here can give you accurate predictions. If someone had accurate predictions, they would keep it to themselves and make millions.

I feel so sorry for your economy, the people do not deserve this :(
losing 7% in 3 days is unreal, that like BTC stability...lol

They probably aren't, just upvotes anything pro-bitcoin

BlockChain is good. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:23:53
I wouldn't expect the currency of a major country with millions to people to be less stable than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:56:13
Your name yes, shipping address no. Who cares if they see your name? Thousands of people probably have your time.

Mining services were once worth it in some situations when alt coins were a thing and people invested in them, mining them and hoping their value would go up.
For bitcoin? ITS NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT AT ALL
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:21:09
GUYS ITS DOWN 2%
FUCKIN CRASHING
SELL OUT

Man, the Canadian dollar fell that much to USD? I remember when CAD was a bit over USD, now 1 CAD = $.88 USD. 
USD is destroying all currencies...Except bitcoin! Digital gold...literally. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:11:10
Another alt coin? I thought those died a while back. You trying to revive the dead? Resurrect is still on cooldown. It uses a lot of mana, anyways. Do you have a mana pot? 
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:21:17
Going to try this one. Is it safe?
Will be using it on OS X, and afterwards will store my wallet encrypted on an AES partition. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:14:03

sell out

Yeah. I'd short USD long term as eventually it will even out. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:53:24
Should hit $10,000 in the next 24 hours
Nobody can predict the future and it's best you think twice before taking financial advice from people on @_date: 2014-11-12 19:41:18

Reminds me of the South Park where cartman bought an amusement park, never let anyone in for an extended period of time. When he started letting people in, the gates flooded. 
Too bad this won't really work. It's like not selling your product to market your product...Only if you create a need, a higher demand, you can up the price.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:36:18
You're pretty much fucked, bluntly said. 
Keep backups and backups of those backups.

Sorry our currency is worth so much more than yours...
Haha...Just kidding.
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:45:24
It will drop as soon as it hits its all time high, and then slowly raise back up, most likely. People will sell seeing as it's an all time high, but then buy back once it's lower.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:43:26
I read yesterday that BTC price will probably not go over $400 for at least a year. I also have read numerous times it will be over $1k by the end of the year. I remember reading it will be $10k by October. 
No one can predict the future, and BTC is an unpredictable currency to work with to begin with. Just play it safe everyone.
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:12:13
Really good site, nice work devs
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:30:53
My mom trades Forex and was explaining how currencies will dip down a LOT before going up to a good level. I feel as bitcoin is doing that now. It's pretty standard. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:00:12
I use bitcoin to pay for my rent, bills, expenses, fast food, groceries...Basically everything.
I have a Bitcoin debit card.
@_date: 2015-10-01 03:00:35
Yes, I literally can only send $300 USD of Bitcoin...To a Bitcoin wallet. My money is STUCK.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:02:45
How do you propose people pay for rent, food, bills, etc? 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:09:12
@_date: 2015-10-01 02:45:38
So why can't I send the BTC in my Circle account back to my wallet?
@_date: 2015-10-01 03:09:45
Yeah. I can't withdraw all my funds. They are bitcoin - I didn't convert them to USD - and I can only withdraw $300 out of $2000. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 03:04:03
I have a $300 limit to my bank account, and $300 limit to sending to any wallet. I think there should be no limit for sending to a wallet.
I use Blockchain's wallet for taking payments, Circle has worked for me for months.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:54:39
So you can convert your fiat to BTC, and quickly use your BTC when you need to use USD.
@_date: 2015-10-01 06:43:28
No reason or notifications at all. I just withdraw BTC. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 03:55:33
I've had the account for at least 3 months and withdrawn over $10,000. There is no new security feature.
@_date: 2015-10-01 02:51:50
I've withdrawn lots of money through Circle...How do I up my limit? It doesn't provide information on it.
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:40:27
Looks excellent, but really need USD support.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:30:09
What wallet is most recommended? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:03:22
Can you link me the google drive link they sent you?
