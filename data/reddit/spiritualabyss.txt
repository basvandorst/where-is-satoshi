There's at least 3 projects. LN and there's 2 others I forgot the name. One is to help with privacy more and the other had to do with more scaling
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:07:46
best time to hold! you are currently seeing one of the lowest prices in bitcoin in weeks. Those 3 coins can easily double in value within 16 weeks
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:37:18
what's your point? did you provide any answers? if not than I don't know what your point is
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:25:07
actually if you do enough research it's very obvious what's happening. BTC has a very strong support level above 8k meaning it's nearly impossible to drop below that. Every year during the mid of Jan there is a huge dip in price. This is due to probably both people cashing out for taxes and chinese new years cashing out so they can spend for their holiday. What happens every year a few weeks after mid Jan the prices always go back up. 
Selling now would be the worst time to sell in other words. At least wait 2 to 3 weeks and you'll see what I mean
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:34:30
But what if a trade between two coins is not profitable and in fact is a loss ? Are they still going to tax you even tho you lost money? That's literally stealing money from you.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:40:37
Just get a job and keep holding. Do not try messing with the bitcoins to much. You will lose. If you want to diversify than don't get crazy with it, maybe move around like 6k.
Regardless your priority should be keeping your coins secure and finding a job to pay for your responbilites. You don't want to really pull out of bitcoin to much because that's your potential future.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:25:45
yep that was it!

Why do people still use kraken? and why do people still use coinbase . I just don't understand. unless kraken caters to locations no other exchanges cater to ?

it's basically the same type of wave as the last one.  I'm pretty sure I even remember them planning this out weeks ago. They were waiting for the news of CME to get closer so the wave of newbies come in and so they can reclog the toliet and like you quoted in the title "the greater fool theory"

.....wow you almost had a troll thing going but now you just sound like a retard. You probably embarrassed at this point
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:00:38
Because it's a social network and a store of value as well. It just hasn't scaled enough yet to reach it's currency phase. As you can see it's still pretty complicated for the average person to get into bitcoin.

That's BTC , using Segwit of course. When you use Segwit the fees really aren't that big a difference than bch.  I agree bch is slightly better but definitely not a massive upgrade.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:48:46
Yeah I know if any way it's sold back to your bank account, it will be traced. I suppose selling for cash is the only way to avoid it.
Now how about if you claim the bitcoin was a gift, will that make any difference ?

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:34:19
Well there you go, They're another coin trying to steal bitcoins name. BTC use to be just another sub to discuss about bitcoin. But it wasn't as large. When bitcoin hardforked an alt coin was made and the supporters of it took over that sub instead of making their own. I believe they rely on coming here to try and pump life into their coin
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:19:48
Yeah exactly, you wasted it when it didn't evem have a store of value. Do you realize how much money you lost because of that? And we still need to gain more of a store a value now to actually make it worth being used as a currency.

What are you talking about ? Lol! If you didn't buy food you'd be dead ? That's hilarious and one of the dumbest things I ever heard. Anyone with common sense can get food without money if their life depended on it. And congratulations you mined bitcoin and never invested into the future and didn't have multiple sources of income. I actually make money and invest in bitcoin because I believe in its future. And if you understood anything about money you'd understand the basic layers that apply to bitcoin before it becomes a currency. 1, it needs to be a social network, this is exactly where we are with bitcoin, it's in the process of gaining social adoption. 2 it needs a store of value so people can store their wealth in it. And finally 3 , once it's proven to work as a store of value than it'll be less volatile and can work work as a worldwide currency.

By not fueling the war you already are helping prevent it. That's just the beginning of it. Bitcoin to be a world currency means uniting. Oil won't be priced in fiat anymore which would change things drastically. A big part of war is based on greed of oil.

@_date: 2018-08-11 05:47:52
If you're thinking long term than put your shoes in the new generations. The kids born today wil most definitely prefer something like Bitcoin over gold. The tables will shift and long term I would stay away from the stock bubble.  
  
When you think long term, you have to think about what the children will be more interested in. We are shifting more towards social networks everyday and Bitcoin is a social network and Bitcoin being a protocol means that bitcoin IS the money of the internet. And I really believe it's going to play out that way especially that the kids of today lose more trust in their goverment as time goes on.

Also thanks to his children. I believe they played a huge role as he felt the need to speak up in front of the nation because he understands us because of his children being apart of the same generation. His daughter even has bitcoin. It took a lot of balls to speak up against all those old evil money hungry bastards. I hope he raises a new bar for more being in that environment to speak out.
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:10:36
how is he an idiot? This is huge for bitcoin and spreads adoption. That BTC being spent doesn't dissappear because starbucks converts it. It's just sold to an exchange putting it back into circulation. Starbucks is worldwide, if it accepts bitcoin, bitcoin will be more of known worldwide currency which will give many people more reason to have bitcoin especially if they travel, they can simply just spend Bitcoin.  
  
The fact this brings more media attention to bitcoin and has to do with adoption, I don't think OP is an idiot and he just made his own investment decision which most likely will be in the green for him.

Don't ever tell someone to go all in, why you would put yourself in that predicament. You enlighten him about the technology of bitcoin, you give him some references how to get started/learn and then he can make his own educated decision based on his research. But you can surely give him your opinion that you think it's a great investment but that's it. Don't get yourself involved with someone else is money.

Don't think of it as you are promised to get rich. Anything can happen any day where bitcoin can just crash due to worldwide problems. Another coin can even take bitcoins place in the future. We all see bitcoin having a bright future but it's not promised. That being said, invest wisely and throw down whatever you can afford to lose.

The wallet comes from blockchain.com. definitely legit but I don't feel so safe security wise
edit* and thanks , seems like everyone usually points to the hardware wallets and that's why I posted this thread to verify that as the good ideal security measure.
Another question though, are all hardware wallets idenditcal or do they offer different things ? is there one that's considered the 'best' ?

@_date: 2017-08-14 07:07:36
Sounds like you need to do a lot more research or else you'll end up fucking something up. And hundreds for 1 coin. ? Ha! It's thousands for 1 coin now. It use to be hundreds. That's why your here because you heard it can make you money as it did for many people that did buy it when it was hundreds but right now 1 coin is 4 thousand dollars. But don't be worried. You can still put it in 100 dollars and you'll get a coin in decimals. Instead of 1 full coin you'll have like 0.14567 or something like that. But you need to watch videos and do research to understand bitcoin because right now your just trying to dive in without any knowledge. I'll give you basics but you need to do research. You buy bitcoins through an online exchange market such as coinbase. Or through localbitcoins where you can meet someone in person and give them cash for bitcoins or through a bitcoin atm like you mentioned which has a high fee but it's fast and doesn't require much identification like the exchanges do. You will need a wallet which you can download on your phone. You need to do research on this as well to make sure you have. A secure wallet and properly save your wallet id number and take the proper actions so you don't lose your wallet and your bitcoins. To get started you can check out bitcoin.com and look at the exchanges they offer and look at the wallets. Do research on them to learn more, watch videos, ask more questions, etc.. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:08:26
Hell yeah ! That will help make bitcoin blow up. If we can make it go trending viral we can definitely make bitcoin climb up to 10k faster than expected 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:32:06
This isn't even the real big value. It's still just the beginning. You can sell them through the market exchanges or even in person to other people. And people will buy because this isn't the most value. At the moment it is, but it can easily climb to 10k+ so of course people will still buy.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:49:46
You just wanna make sure you meet somewhere where you aren't being set-up to potentially get robbed for all your bitcoin or money. a pub can work out if you know the pub pretty well

If as a community we all stick together and keep pushing bitcoins enlightment I definitely think it's possible! that being said...
grandma can I have a 5k loan until january... Let's hope I can explain  bitcoin well enough to get that lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:56:15
a better plan would be to hold until around December or january at least. You sold at a pretty shitty time when the segwit just got activated and needs some time for fees to get lower and what not.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:59:07
Obviously I don't know any hence I asked the question.  If I was an expert I wouldn't be asking. Obviously I admire their business trades and want to hear their opinion. And every new Yorker knows the behind the scenes. This is common sense to us, it doesn't mean we are expertise.... 
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:49:05
There's about triple the amount of choices you think you have. Also don't forget there's also bitcoin ATM's which are instant transactions. And you also have local bitcoins.
since you are new, keep doing more research. Don't assume things so quickly. I been studying bitcoins for months now and still am learning more things all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:05:17
A common simple one would be coinbase , it's an exchange market so slightly different than localbitcoins.  Or bitcoin ATMs might be in your area

@_date: 2017-08-11 09:34:30
I'm not to sure what your asking lol Are you just asking how to profit? because there's no actual answer. It's always a risk. Most people will just say to hold onto your coins until the price decides to sky rocket because a lot of us foresee the future in bitcoin and that it's prices will continue to break new records.
But at the same time it can also crash, your best bet is to keep studying the community. Study bitcoin, read as much you can from different sources (not just here because you'll mostly get biased answers) and make your own educated decision. And of course don't put in money yyou can't afford. Nobody can guarentee a sky rocket in pricing. So keep puttnig money in gradually but money you can afford to put in.

@_date: 2017-08-14 07:19:55
First make sure you get the ID. And once you have it come back and re ask your question but include that you have your wallet ID number and someone should be able to help. I'm kinda new myself , I just know the basics. Oh and make sure you never share the wallet ID number !
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:16:53
They said the same thing about the first fork and look at us now. That was when bitcoin was sitting at like 2,800 I believe ? So after the next fork we probably will rise to 6k haha!
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:06:13
is that a good thing for bitcoin when it goes off?
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:25:08
The most discrete possible way under the radar is to buy it with cash in person. This can be done through localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:12:53
When they talk about the correction they're basically saying bitcoin might do what it use to do and have a dramtic drop and go back down to lets say 3k a coin. But it can also be the opposite. We can be in the correction right now which is why the price is going up. I think the correction is determinded on the user who thinks it's currently over valued or under valued. I believe it's undervalued and will continue to rise without a dramatic drop 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:15:34
hardware wallets are always to be recommended
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:23:34
technically a correction will end up being 100k+ so the correction is just a long slow process
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:39:07
Use a trusted market exchange and you'll be fine. If you are buying bitcoin in person than meet up by a police station or something like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:00:04
In the meantime you can download a mobile wallet, just make sure you secure it with 2 step authorization.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:56:48
Do the coins stay in the exchange? Or after you buy, can you transfer them to your own hardware/mobile wallet? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:14:25
Meme's are pretty awesome and brings in the newer generation. That's what bitcoin needs to adapt more. All the newbies recognizing bitcoin because of it, all the newbies gaining knowledge and all the newbies spreading knowledge. Don't underestimate the power of the memes
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:31:11
That's a great first step. And I highly believe bitcoin will see a 5k+ rise in the next week or few weeks. A lot of news coverage happening lately which means a lot of investors will jump on it. But if any crashes happen just remember to hold, don't panic
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:19:23
I was actually wondering this myself, like where does the most accurate live price of bitcoin actually come from ?
I usually just google "bitcoin price" and google has it's own live price but I don't even know if the google one is the most accurate. I have no idea if there is an official platform with the most accurate price
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:37:31
Wow really? Was it a similar report ? (Positive sounding) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:42:09
It's being recognized WORLDWIDE. Bitcoin never been this popular which means we will not see the dips it use to have so people gotta stop scaring others. We can easily continue to rise to 10k without any dips because bitcoin finally reached a new tier thanks to the media and social media. If we all spread the word it will keep going UP. Put stickers in your subway systems, spread the word on social media. Make it go trending and then more media news coverages will pick up on it and then more people will hop on the band wagon and make the prices rise and rise
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:26:56

We are in a bigger game now because competition will rise and it's more so trending now than ever before, just look at all the new users posting every single day every few hours lol. But that's even better for Bitcoin (;
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:27:23
This is a good way to get bitcoin trending more. The younger crowd is what sparks viral sensations. And this type of sensation can bring bitcoin another nice train ride.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:10:12
Yeah there's a bunch in Brooklyn and downtown in Manhattan. But those machines charge a 10% fee so not the best option but it's a fast option with no waiting time or anything so it's great for that. I've used it myself as well. MAKE sure you keep the receipt. I believe it shows your wallet id on it and you don't want that getting into someone else hands.
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:40:34
good one
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:37:04
This wallet seems to only offer a a pin code as security. I don't see any option to have something like the google authenticator 2 step authorization. and obviously a pincode is pretty useless. 
So let's say I want to get a hardware wallet, what are the pros and cons ? 
And will it be easy to send over whatever bits I have now to the hardware wallet ? I'm guessing there will a fee to transfew my btc from this wallet to a hardware wallet ? 
thanks again 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:57:42
Yeah thats what i meant. The status quo is pretty much because of banks and all that. Which is why when you use a bitcoin ATM you don't need any identification because you aren't using anything with a bank

Okay cool, So I'm not the only one bugging out from seeing this right now 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:43:37
thanks buddy, Wasn't sure how it worked but now I realize my mistake. Thanks again
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:35:34
thanks that was pretty more than enough to clarify it for me. Seems like coinbase is the easy way to go. If someone knows a better place to buy that'd be cool to share
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:06:39
What's even better is that they're advertising it and not saying how volatile it can be. They even included how bitcoin exchanges are open 24/7. That's gonna catch a lot of eyes here because investors here are use to the markets being down weekends and only open week days but not with bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:18:35
There's nothing wrong with asking as it creates new insights from different perspectives/opinions. Some people can predict the future, they just don't know it until it becomes reality (;

@_date: 2017-08-11 04:21:07
The way I see it as, bitcoin is like gold and holds more value. In the future not everyone will be able to afford this especially if the price increases, so in alternative we have the alt coins which are more like silver, copper , iron , etc... So bitcoin will remain a high valued coin which you can make purchaes for very large valuable things as to where the alt coins can be used for smaller things such as super markets and what not.  
I have no idea if this is even logical but it's one of my persceptions 
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:37:27
Thanks bud
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:50:02
I believe the address will be different. You can have multiple addresses if you have multiple wallets. The address is simply just the place your sending the money to. So if you buy coins through an exchange/market online. You want to make sure you send those coins to the address on the wallet on your phone.
For example Coinbase market on the web. If I buy 1 bitcoin through coinbase my bitcoin will be in coinbase. Which is not safe. So I would then send the money from coinbase to the address of the wallet on my device. and the money will then be on my wallet on my phone .From there I can send it to other addresses like another one of my wallets or another person if im buying/selling/trading anything .
I only have 1 wallet which is blockchain because it has a simple interface on the app version. But if I start to get big on bitcoin i would definitely get a hardware wallet. And then I'd have to send the bitcoin from this wallet to the address of the new wallet. And I believe on the hardware wallets, they are always changing your address so you don't always have the same address. That's also a safety measure for you.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:59:03
I'm fucked and have to wait until monday to buy more because of banks SMH. It's so annoying watching these prices go up
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:38:11
yeah I use blockchain.com for my wallet, it's alright. But what everyone will suggest is getting a hardware wallet. Much safer of what I understand
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:41:11
perhaps we already are in the price correction.. bitcoin always been undervalued. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:22:20
I'm pretty new myself, took me about 2 weeks to understand it more thoroughly. It's pretty simple though when it starts to make sense. It's only confusing at first.  The research is just important because bitcoin has a strong meaning behind it's creation so it should be respected before diving into it
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:19:33
Something I realized here in NYC. Most of the bitcoin ATM's are in the dominated black area's. Not sure if that means anything but I recently found that out when looking for a bitcoin atm. And other than the dominated black areas, there's also a bunch in manhattan for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:06:33
I was just reading that the IRS does NOT recognize bitcoin as a currency but recognizes it as property. They will try and get a piece of it as much as possible. 
Does anyone know if there's a way around this ? How can they just decide it's a property when it's literally a currency...
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:46:12
Thanks bud, it appears with a wire it should be available the same day or possibly next day. I'll have to give it a try.
I just always wondered how do day traders do it ? To be able to buy and sell the coins so fast without a waiting time. I might be interested in day trading in the near by future
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:53:33
I bet they do because theyre telling me it takes  up to 2 weeks just to verify my account. 
Which market(s) do you use bud ? and are they same day transacations ?
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:12:27
You can't really time it. It was dropping today but now it's back up to 4300. I believe we are in a pretty stable time and it will only continue to go up with random downs but gradually climb up right after. 
I was asking the same questions when it was at 2800 and i missed the train to 4300. But i hopped on the train when it was at 3700. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:00:03
Those are just some factors but many more factors are taking place.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:20:04
Thanks for that answer. I've been doing tons of research on bitcoin but it's a lot of information to gather especially with all the propaganda going on lol.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:55:46
Well the first split was great. It gave everyone free coins basically and bitcoin continued to thrive. I'm not sure the different of the 2x will be. But I'm hoping for the same outcome, more free coins and bitcoin to surpass the new alt coin like it always does
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:12:15
I rather put them in my wallet and exchange them when the time is right, not leave them in some exchange where they're more vulnerable.  I'm guessing they don't support sending your coins to your personal wallet ? I'm not sure if you are here to give me the answer I'm looking for lol.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:00:12
These hipsters are helping by making it more trending. These hipsters are investing like 100 dollars mate. They aren't really affecting the market that much. They're just helping it become more recognized. Their pockets are shallow so i wouldn't worry about that 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:42:56
but how did you lose any? You intentionally lost by selling for lower when you could of just held. Did you panic sell or some shit?
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:34:24
I want more

and if you are jewish, was my thread offensive? I admire the dominance jews tend to have in these areas and hearing from them i consider to be inspirational because their opinions aren't based on the media, in fact they control roughly 90% of the media outlets lol

A sign that eventually microsoft and sony might start accepting bitcoin payments lol
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:10:06
But it was mentioned that it will be off in 2 weeks. So in 2 weeks does that mean the price should contunie riding the train? or will the train have a bumpy ride after the 2 weeks. Sorry for the noob question ;3

@_date: 2017-08-12 05:38:51
drops are happening every other minute... It's constantly dropping from 1 dollar to 100 dollars.  The only way a BIG drop can happen is if someone is manipulating the market. Which I doubt, I think bitcoin is just becoming more popular worldwide. 
Spread the message yourself, I am doing so with social media and I Was even thinking about buying bitcoin stickers and putting them around the MTA subways in NYC since I live here
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:00:48
Because of the change that happened on August 1st

@_date: 2017-08-11 04:13:42
I live in the US and I buy bitcoins without ever providing any type of my goverment information so I have no idea what your talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:54:55
This was a pretty weak shot at begging. Especially in a community where most people hold lol
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:28:14
The reporter's on these papers are always retarded. I'm just happy they didn't emphasize anything negative because that's what they're good at. But I agree, they obviously have zero knowledge about bitcoin and just made that up because they don't actually know what's driving up the prices.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:00:42
bitcoin simply does not die
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:14:39
thanks for breaking it down for me. I'm not good at picking my words but I can tell you understood where I was coming from and this guy has no idea what he's talking about. He keeps bringing hatred into this when that was never the topic smh. He claims to hate it but he's manifesting it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:41:19
So instead of 1 btc I should have converted it my self and put 298 for  0.07 BTC ?
 Do you know if this can be cancelled lol
And thanks, at first that didn't make sense to me.I thought if i wanted to transfer my BTC from Gemini to my personal wallet it would be through a deposit and not a withdrawal 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:14:56
Congrats brotha. Now you can ride her the same time you continue riding the bitcoin train
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:52:05
That's a lot of money to ask strangers for advice. But since you say losing that wouldn't really affect you much then you might as well invest it. A 1k rise would yield you very nice profits with that kind of figure. And you can also donate 1 coin to me who has yet to make up one 1 full coin lol.
But yeah go for it, but safety first! Since your feeling with decent figures you want to have a secure wallet
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:19:37
Well that's no fun skipping everything from 10k to 100k. Let's just climb 1k by 1k so some of us can use that to our advantage :p
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:36:48
Make sure you verify your identity first. They will ask you to upload a picture of your ID and probably ask you a few questions
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:47:17
I figured it out! Sorry for being a noob haha. I already bought the BTC the proper way (: thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:47:14
I'm forseeing that we will continue to climb to 10k without any big dips! We won't have any dips until the goverment steps in so keep buying folks 
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:59:46
Have you checked for bitcoin atms? Found out we have like 150 of them in my city and I didn't even know 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:25:54
Gemini does work, But it says it's gonna take up to 2 weeks just to verify my account! Do you know if that will be the case? I already did the verication process but 2 weeks , I can miss out on a lot lol.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:25:42
That's why I made it clear that I'm from NYC. But I'm pretty sure that dude came in here with a negative perspective which I really don't care. 
Jews gentrified a HUGE part of brooklyn which is awesome!. Jews are making it safer for a lot of communities here but at the same are sky rocketing the prices. They tend to live among the ghetto area's in gated communities, if you don't believe me go look at the Seagate in Brooklyn. An entire gated community with their OWN police and ambulance for the jews who live there. This is common and is seen all over new york. I am myself been all over new york to verify.. 
Anyways I never meant to offend anyone. But I gotta stop expecting people to have an open mind....
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:04:13

@_date: 2017-08-17 04:11:04
well shit, how many wallets do you have ? lol or are you stating that you probably deleted the possible wallet it can be in ?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:18:35
Yes that's exactly what I was wondering. Wasn't sure how they process it. Thanks bud. If you know any exchanges that can use passport it'd be cool to share
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:12:59
okay so once the coins do get sent over to the address on the hardware wallet then I don't need to worry about the 12 word seed from bitcoin core anymore? because I'll have a new seed with the hardware wallet ? 
I just want to have one focus instead of worrying about two separate seeds
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:09:31
I think you missed the point that bitcoin can simply crash and you'd lose everything you had. Another coin can even take bitcoins place in the future.  This is why it's not a guarentee and more like a gamble at this point
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:06:26
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:23:03
How do I go about buying a miner and running it? I'd be interested. Type noobie here so a thorough explainationg would be cool 
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:58:48
Do the coins stay in the exchange? Or after you buy, can you transfer them to your own hardware/mobile wallet? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:47:46
It's not up to the exchanges. It's required by them because of banks and what not. I'm sure they would love to make it easier to sell the coins but they have to deal with legal terms and it also depends on where you live. Other than that, localbitcoins or bitcoin ATM machines. Those are becoming more popular now
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:36:58
Yeah that's what I'm saying, I didn't mean to be offensive but I am getting some blacklash lol it was just a question because I truly admire their business decisions.  But thanks for being coperative (:
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:26:19
Which kinda shows that a lot of people here might not have any knowledge in finance, good or bad at least they're supporting bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:43:19
Prices been going up throughout the whole night. I doubt your having trouble selling it haha
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:44:13
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:13:58
Thanks. I know the price can't be determined. I guess a better question would have been if it's a benefit to bitcoin of getting rid of asicboost?  instead of "if the price will rise?" haha. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:18:42
it's pretty safe and make sure you enable the second seucirty option like finger print or whatever they have to offer. But I believe the safest wallets are the hardware wallets. I'm pretty sure you have to pay for them but obviously it's worth it if you are thinking about investing a nice chunk. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:14:01
They're just trying to control it but none the less still good news for bitcoin to adoption to a market 
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:59:12
I was thinking of putting up bitcoin stickers in the NYC underground subway system. over a million people use it every single day

@_date: 2017-08-13 10:09:59
Not really, Look at the attention bitcoin is getting that it never had before. It's definitely possible to keep climbing
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:21:40
You should also acknowledge the fact your information sits in les secure places like the schools data base system which is much easier to hack.
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:25:36
I like that plan and makes perfect sense to minimise loses. Thanks mate.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:52:48
damn that sounds real shitty. What markets do you use ? I never thought it'd be this stressful to buy bitcoins lol. I just really want to avoid using a bitcoin atm, that 10% fee is crazy. I used it once because it was my only option but I really want to get on a market with same day transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:45:22
Because those people most likely transfer the money from the exchange to someplace safe right after the exchanges 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:56:07

@_date: 2017-08-11 03:56:45
It's just the simple fact that you can't afford it buddy. A lot of us are in this pool where we have yet to reach 1 full coin. The only way is if you throw in more money than usual every week or every other week. In the position we are in now some people still fear a dip is coming but honestly it looks like bitcoin is gonna keep going up thus point on, especially because of all this media coverage. Bitcoin is legit almost trending. IF we can get it trending in a viral sensation kind of way than you best believe it will sky rocket
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:10:44
Nope nobody does that here. You gotta earn it in some kind of way and unfortunately begging isn't a way
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:12:45
As a 23 year old I can barely afford 1 coin and been trying to convince some family for a loan to invest but it's nearly impossibly especially when they're old school. They would think it's a joke. So I'm taking money out of each pay check to put into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:45:28
This is the wall street journal that many investors and business men all buy and bitcoin was mentioned on the side bar on the front page for today's paper. Expect a rise ?
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:11:34
but other than charts, is there anything else to back it up? I just don't understand how they can be corelated. I'm also not so educated on this, So im not denying it but I also like to challenge the idea of things
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:18:23
Ah okay so it's every thursday. Didn't know it was apart of their routine lol. It took them nearly 3 weeks to verify my account!! which is why im so anxious to use their service already lol. 
Also do you know a way to buy bitcoins through them to make it instantly available to withdraw into your wallet ?
I've bought just 300$ worth and the amount showed up in btc in my account but it's on hold and can't be withdrawn into my wallet until some verification. Just curious if there's a way to buy the bitcoins so it can automatically be available to withdraw into my wallet. I can take loses in the future if I have to rely on wait times lol
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:18:37

It's new York's cities biggest paper on business. It's called "the wall street journal" and there's a section called "business and finance" and they dedicated the front page of that to bitcoin which i was totally shocked. Investors tend to follow these papers. And uhm I know they have a website, wsj.com go in their search bar and type bitcoin to see any recent articles journalist covered
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:49:03
I see what you mean by the patience as I have to wait at least 2 days before i can make a purchase due to verifaction process of my credit card. Which im totally fine with. But do you know another market where I can make a instant purchase ? just wanna make a small instanst purchase so i can see some type of bitcoin in my wallet lol.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:29:11
Your school data base has your SSN which can be used to get all of the above.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:55:49
Yeah swings are happening every 2 minutes. It's constantly going up and down by the hundred which is how you know we are in the correction because it's ultimately going up within it's swings. The rocket will keep going until another rocket is fired towards us and I don't see one in sight yet. I guess we will know in November if we are gonna take off on another rocket to 10k+
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:52:24
I don't understand what you did. On bitcoin.com they don't even show simplex as an exchange. Where did you find simplex ?
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:31:53
It can easily double 4k by the end of this year as well as double down to 2k. But one thing we do know is bitcoin always goes down and then sky rockets to new highs.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:43:03
Thanks, that's exactly what I needed to know. I picked the wrong buying option which is what confused me
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:38:56
I don't understand what makes you people think we need a correction. Bitcoin is still undervalued. It can easily continue to rise to 10k because it's finally being recognized. It never was this popular so no shit it was having extreme dips. But now is the time it can continue to rise like a succesful company. It's correction will happen later on, probably around the 10k mark 
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:52:41
I saw that same ad like 2 weeks ago ! More signs keep appearing 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:15:55
That's because of all the heavy trending bitcoin has been getting. It's still balancing it's self out at the same time the demand is still increasing. Be patient and it will be worth it
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:55:50
i give it 6 weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:10:45
I agree most will hold out and research because it's a new market to them. But seeing how the price more than quadrupled, it will surely catch a lot of attention because they aren't use to stocks having insane increases like that and I know they don't wanna miss out.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:41:35
Why would you say it's not awesome ? Look at the differences it made in Bushwick and bedford stuyversant and harlem and other areas. Where do you live ? I grew up in brooklyn all my life and thank goodness for the gentrification. It's so much safer so yes it is awesome. And I don't think it was offensive. I think it's the person themselves who make it to be offensive. Another person here that claims to be jewish isnt offended at all because he actually understands the question. And that is exactly how they gentriefied it duhhhh. They been in brooklyn since way back. They bought the buildings in dumbo when they were 2 million and now it can go for 30 million. This is how they dominated the real estate market in new york.

@_date: 2017-08-11 04:31:06
yes exactly , buy them through coinbase and then send it to your wallet. But also make sure you have a secured wallet and make sure you set up some kind of security like 2 step authorization 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:44:47
This isn't a stock buddy. It's a currency. And yes it's how much 1 BTC is worth. In the future it can easily be worth 50k for 1 coin or it can go back down to 2k for 1 coin. Be wise and do research and invest what you can afford to lose (:
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:38:04
Thanks, that was a good simple way to break it down
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:40:45
Whatever amount of money you put into the exchange will convert to BTC. It doesn't matter if it's 50 dollars or 50,000. So yes you can buy fractions. Kinda like how there's 100 pennies to a dollar . There's a bunch of decimal numbers to 1 bitcoin. You can also buy them in person from localbitcoins using cash. or Bitcoin ATM's.
and you sell the same way as you buy
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:34:21
yeah man I'm trying to pick up knowledge but it's a little complicated lol. I just wanna be prepared. Hopefully someone has a good answer

It's never to late to buy. But only put in what you can afford. It's never wise to put all of your savings

Well it seems like you've already made a nice profit if you already had Bitcoins for a little while. So why don't you just sell/buy your coins to balance out your spending so you aren't losing anything
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:28:01
I actually saw something about that as well, intersting! 
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:56:28
I just think it's a coinceidence. I don't see how crypto currency has anything to do with it.  It more so has to do with Japan and the worldwide coverage it's recieving

been waiting for Gemini to verify me for like 5 days already, it's so annoying. Shouldn't take more than 2 days..
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:23:34
Getting an ID in nyc is a pretty long process with long waits. I'm on a more urgent request at the moment and a passport serves as a valid ID so I'm sure there's exchanges out there that will take it like Gemini except I'm hoping to find one that doesn't take 2 weeks to verify lol. But yeah obviously I will get an ID eventually when my circumstances are better suitable
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:01:31
The popularity it's getting now though, I wouldn't be surprised if it goes up to 5k before any drops.
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:26:13
I wonder how legit this really is. I feel like HBO doesn't need to pay anything because GOT has such a huge fan base that they won't really lose anything if they don't pay. Fans will still be watching and most fans are pretty brainless and wouldn't even see the leaked scripts if they do leak. 
On another note, hackers can play a big role for bitcoin with their capabilites in finding exploits and what not
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:29:58
I'm pretty sure you can have multiple wallets. I don't use a paid one either since I don't invest more. I currently use a blockchain wallet I downloaded on my phone. In every wallet you have an address. So for example if you downloaded the blockchain wallet, you'll see that you have a recieving address. So from your original that you have coins in, you just send them to your recieving address from your other wallet. Just like you would do if you were sending someone else money to their wallet, you send it to their address. So you can do that with yourself.
I'm not sure if my answer was clear enough. I'm also continuing to learn more myself
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:12:31
This would be a huge hit if you winners can be rewarded something since it you pay per move. Not sure if that can be done though
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:01:08
it would actually be even easier to use crypto. Simply just scan a QR code from your wallet app. They just need some kind of POS system that supports this.  
  
I myself am one of those people who swipe their card the wrong way because I straight up never use my card. I'm more about that cash. I always hated banks even before I learned about bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:18:49
I think the price would generally go down a bit as a 'dip'  but that'd make a great time to buy out those coins for it to rise up again.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:40:46
Isn't my bitcoin address associated with my wallet?Anyways all I want to know is if I buy bitcoins through this exchange bittrex, that I'll be able to send the coins from the exchange to my wallet. I guess this question is mostly for anyone who has experience with this exchange
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:54:40
Thanks for the dedicated post, I appreciate the response as someone that loves to gain and share knowledge. Ledger definitely seems like the go-to at this point so you definitely helped lay out some clarity for me! 
And just to make things more clear,  whatever coins I have in my current mobile wallets, i can send them all over to my ledger device, correct? I'm assuming that's the main purpose lol
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:46:05
Sha-256 is apart of the Sha-2 family  
  
SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). They are built using the Merkle–Damgård structure, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies-Meyer structure from a (classified) specialized block cipher.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:52:57
LOL, So obvious what's going on again, shit coin pumps and then FUD gets spread here. Really pathetic
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:04:56
oh then it sounds like it's totally normal. It seems like all exchanges make you take a picture of your government identifications and credit card depending on what your using to pay with. But you can also look at the exchanges bitcoin.com has to offer to see if any other ones are accepting in Japan in case they might have a lower fee.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:18:14
I never saw one person say that lol. All the real bitcoiners will tell you NOT to leave it in the exchange for obvious reasons. The exchange can easily steal your coins and claim some bullshit error occurred or whatever the case may be. It's just not ideal. Get a hardware wallet and you forever have your own bank in your own safety.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:45:57

It's funny how every dip people just start attacking each others emotions to push that domino effect. And then there's always some random pump and the dominos flip. It can definitely drop to 3k maybe 2.5k and it can also easily go back to 5 in less than an hour.

most of wallstreet got out at 20k. I work around NYC and know a female who knows nothing about BTC, she was told by some friends in this wallstreet field to buy a bitcoin at 7k. She did and she sold it at 19k. She knows NOTHING about BTC. I was honestly salty when I found out because I did not exit at the top. But I do highly believe we will see a new top some time this year or next year. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:03:40
dude I'm not denying any of that. The point is 1 btc is still 1 btc, you aren't actually losing any btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:18:14
1 BTC still equals 1 BTC. If she's that retarded to think the value of 1 BTC doesn't change than she deserves to have a failed business. I can't believe your even arguing this. If his reply was 1 BTC  = 1 BTC when she was talking about a completely different value than she's the naive fool.
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:02:39
that's 100% accurate. I just feel like the strong minds should try and talk some sense into them and spread the truth because that sub is growing fast and sadly a lot of noobs go there and then the noobs start believing in their lies.

Damn sorry you got hurt by all the FUD bullshit, at least now you learned a valuable lesson in bitcoin. To just HODL unless you have good trading experience, otherwise just hodl. 
Anyways, if it doesn't go back down to 3.6k over this weekend than I don't think it will for a while. If it doesn't go to that over this weekend than there's a chance it's just gonna keep going up and you'll end up having to pay the same amount you paid last time lol. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:52:07
Just like first fork bitcoin will stand tall and people will realize once AGAIN that bitcoin is unstoppable and the price will reach a new high once AGAIN

For one shoutout to Romania , Timisoara ~ from America.  But anyways ATM's aren't 100% anonymous, they still require something like a phone number usually. The most anonymous way to buy bitcoin is from other people in cash which they can already do. So I wouldn't worry to much about that.
I think you should definitely study some type of computer engineering, we are in the era of technology and bitcoin is finally getting a taste of this era or better yet this era is finally getting a taste of bitcoin. 
and just out of curiousity since I haven't been to romania in so many years, what shady business is popular in romania that results to money laundering? I never heard of them being known for drugs or anything like that. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:51:28
well if you do that than you aren't any better than all them fud articles. If you are okay with that on your conscious than do you but I think most of us stand up for what's right which is the main reason we are into bitcoin to begin with.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:46:29
wow he looked sad here. Shows he really does care about his projects. This really relates to the typical old tards of the goverment that don't understand bitcoin and how crypto's work in general. These type of old tards are holding back our development as a nation.

those were probably them 3k limit buy orders that bounced it back up. Who knows how many more limits are left to keep it arise. but even without china, bitcoin can easily reach new highs with other people taking over the mining operations
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:06:32
I think it depends on how you look at it since everyone has a different perception. I'm not all in BTC, in fact I'm only 40% but it's very obvious to me that BTC is the leader and will be for a long time which is why i stated how powerful it is for all of us meaning all crypto holders.  
  
And that link got no recognition either 17 hours later...  and no discussion so that didn't help at all.

@_date: 2017-09-12 08:50:06
Why are you making such assumptions. Just because one wants to be discrete with their money doesn't conclude anything. And bitcoin being taxed just means bitcoin is a property, not a currency.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:29:04
I just said exactly why it's like bitcoin in that same sentence, because it's another crypto currency. obviously it's not literally the same but it's still a crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:43:46
This probably been the case all along. but the FUD was a strong attack to make profit for themselves
edit* it's also a good chance they would make these licenses very expensive so the goverment can make some type of profit off this. Perhaps that was the plan at the same time of buying the dip. They're hungry hippos if this will be true.
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:59:19
We might possibly see 2800 but I'm not sure yet either, I want to buy in on the dip but it's hard to predict at this point because of all the speculation. I will also wait until sunday  or possibly until the 30th
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:46:37
This is another reason why hodlers help bitcoin though. Because they help increase it's volume which helps increase the chance of a business to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:21:31
man we need to create organize a group and all of us should reach out to Joe and educate him. He's pushing the idea of how confusing crypto is but it really isn't. Someone who is a good writer should create a thread with this agenda, something like asking Joe to get Andreas back on his show again to explain it for newbies.  
  
Joe is a trusted guy so it would be nice if he becomes educated on this revolution.
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:54:31
I didn't read the article but I don't think China wants to ban bitcoin. They just simply want to regulate it because of the intense money laundering that goes on in China. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:29:12
it's hard to say what we are going to experience until the 30th. But panic sellers need to understand china was never that much involved with bitcoin to begin with. Other miners will take their place.
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:09:30
Sure it wasn't some kind of penny stock pump and dump scam ? it sounds like it wasn't an exchange and you never actually bought bitcoins but you invested the money into their website by putting 1,000$ into buying shares from them ?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:01:01
Just so you all know , JP Morgan is in partnership with etherium (if that's spelled correctly) which is another crypto currency like bitcoin so don't be surprised if they are investing into bitcoin by the millions

Shaming someone is the small picture. And I simply don't believe in bullshit propaganda.

(I think your thinking of hippies, which is different than hipsters)
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:17:25
Government can't really control it, they can ban it but then they lose the chance to some what control it. Since bitcoin isn't 100% private, it can also help the government when it comes to money laundering and what not
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:27:22

Would you look at that, it's already slowly going back up... faster than i thought

I agree, even without china that means so much more room for other miners to jump in ! Really nobody should have panic sell because china only owns about 20% of bitcoin and I bet you a lot of the people in china didnt even sell! They aren't dumb. They know how to access the market regardless if it's ban or not.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:13:37
I don't understand why people think a correction means the price has to go down? Did it ever phantom the mind that a correction suggests the price should keep going up because bitcoin is very under-valued.

I believe the ATM just needs to scan your barcode, so if you have a mobile wallet you can just let the ATM scan your barcode through the mobile wallet. They might have an option to enter the pin manually but that would be kinda annoying to do through an ATM 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:06:44
damn dude your predicting a huge drop lol at least you are mentally prepared.
But I do not see bitcoin ever going below 4k again. at this point i believe it drop by the hundreds and rise in the hundreds on and off but ultimately rising. If all goes well in a few years we can probably expect it to be at least 15k 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:39:07
I don't do it. I just said it as a suggestion. You can most definitely cut your profit by doing that. Just holding is technically the biggest yield. But whoever is a talented trader, they can totally pull off the selling and buying. But it's to risky for me so I just hodl

It's not these shirts that would trend, it's bitcoin. If bitcoin trends than they would totally wear these because bitcoin would be recognized as 'cool and hip' And hipsters finely crafted image tends to be revolved around what's trending. And the shirts can easily become more creative. It doesn't have to be just a technology logo....
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:51:01
yeha I keep seeing good news, which means if these attacks didn't happen we would most likely be seeing 5k right now. I think it was an attack to make all the newbies panic sell so they can eat off them. I'm still expecting to see 5-6k before january

I don't think it's fair to say holders are lucky and not smart. Many holders actually studied the technology behind bitcoin and hold because they believe in it, not because of some meme's. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:46:20
Youre just bugging out. It's also your fault for leaving it in an exchange when everyone was making it clear what to do at the time. But regardless it's probably on hold still. I don't think they want your money. They're becoming big and are probably having trouble keeping up with the daily thousands of new people
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:37:15

it's worth it overall, what does it say the fee is ?
If you don't have that much in coinbase i wouldn't worry. But when you start reaching the 5k+ amount then I would not trust them because you simply can't trust anyone when it comes to money. But a hardware wallet, all you need to do is trust yourself :p but uhm even a regular wallet on your phone can work too but still, hardware wallet is more secure if you plan on sticking around for a while. I'm about to order my hardware wallet, I've been using mobile wallets
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:04:11
don't keep it in coinbase. They can lose it and aren't responsible to pay you back. whenever you complete a transaction, send the coins to your wallet. if you plan on being a hodler than invest in a hardware wallet.

when bitcoin does reach that far and it becomes very hard for regular low income people to own bitcoin than that's when other alt coins will become more reliable to the lower income base. But all the HODLERS will be in the high class at this point and won't have to worry about the alt coins

I didn't see a 500 dollar dip, I only saw a 300 dollar dip but that wasn't the point. I was speaking in general so 500 can fit in there as well.. no biggie and that's obviously nothing with bitcoin lol. The point was just to shed my view on it and see other views on it. I didn't make this post for my ego lol but yeah I can see how it's funny with the constant new posts and their concerns

I really like it and helps with the adoption making bitcoin 'cool'. I remember saying someone should also make cool stickers because I'd love to buy stickers and place them around my city because it's a very popular city and I can't imagine how many other people from this community live in a poplular city. This will make the symbol of bitcoin so much more recognizable 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:27:51
Sounds like you played yourself and you act on impulse. No need to sell out. Just hold, holding doesn't mean hold for 1 week. Sometimes you need to hold for weeeeks/months or years if you believe in the future especially when being attacked the way we are now

It's literally 'impossible' to drop to 0. Just look at the market cap in bitcoin, to drop to 0 is unrealistic.  
Ask her what if gold drops to $0 because that's pretty much what she is asking. She just doesn't know anything about bitcoin. Give her some videos to watch about the technology behind bitcoin so she can get confused by it's intelligence and maybe she will trust it a little more than.

Do you have any experience with buying and selling bitcoin in the same day,minute,or hour ?

I don't think it's fair to say holders are lucky and not smart. Many holders actually studied the technology behind bitcoin and hold because they believe in it, not because of some meme's.

If it's mainly controlled by miners that makes very unreliable because they can manipulate the price range to whatever they desire and they can just drop it all and everything would crash. I'm sure it can be worth it to play around but as an investment I don't think so at this point. Since the split happened, This communtity became even stronger, in my opinion showing who the real bitcoin is.

Most of us are probably really upset that we didn't buy when it dropped below 3600. Through my experience of constantly watching bticoin the last 6 months or so, there are some large groups of people who attack, creating numerous new reddit accounts just to post FUD articles to scare the people. We don't know if this is from an enemy that hates bitcoin or if it's from some whales doing this to duck the price so they can profit from it. I would assume it's both but bitcoin seems to always stand tall!
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:35:16
we already hit 5, which means we will reach a new high. Sell at around 5.5k and buy in again at 5. Because as time goes the higher we go , the lows are gonna be pretty 'high' still. From 5 we went to 3. So from 10 we would have dips to like 7 with the same fud shit going on and same panic sells while all the OG's are sitting and laughing in the background. It's always a new high because we are constantly getting new people. Look how much this sub alone grew the past few months.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:55:16
that's not the point though. the point is they would still have 1 btc... Every currency deflates but that wasn't the point that's being covered.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:29:12
it's hard to say what we are going to experience until the 30th. But panic sellers need to understand china was never that much involved with bitcoin to begin with. Other miners will take their place.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:21:36

people always talk about it falling, but don't you think the price can even hit 100k? It'll probably drop by 5k every hour and go back up and shit like that throughout the entire process but I believe with the mainstream it's definitely possible.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:54:59

well if you do that than you aren't any better than all them fud articles. If you are okay with that on your conscious than do you but I think most of us stand up for what's right which is the main reason we are into bitcoin to begin with.
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:13:26
eh a 400 drop ain't much considering the thousands it went up by. Think about it this way, it can easily go up by thousands again doubling what it currently is. 
Depends on the media and mainstream and marketing bitcoin. Putting the symbol all around cities, bitcoin ATM's, etc..
I believe the price will climb back up after labor day

says estimated delivery to be november 2nd. Do you know when the expected fork is to happen? I was hoping to store everything in the ledger before the fork assuming that ledger will support both coins in the sense I can sell the alt coin as soon as i get it. That's the only reason I haven't used the original source in worry that it wouldn't arrive in time
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:41:33

For some reason I don't believe it. I think criminals are more attracted to the shiny things like watches and chains. A shirt doesn't prove there is any actual value within that person. I bet tons of hipsters would wear these shirts and own like 50 dollars worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:17:42
yeah for no i wouldnt worry much, but do look into mobilw wallets at least. and when you start reaching 1k+ you might want to move them from there. 
I started low to like same as you, I'm still low, I think i just recently broke 1.3k cause i bought some in on the dip. when I first bought, it was at 3200. So overall I already did make some spare change as profit. I plan on constantly putting more money in based on whatever i can afford from living check to check. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:53:35

I think you are misled by the holders, holders hold because they don't want to sell. They are in as an investment because that's what they interpreted bitcoin as. They will spend eventually when it's more regulated. And I'm sure people across the globe spend on a daily basis, I noticed you mention Brooklyn before, I bought bitcoin from a few atms in Brooklyn. But in NYC there's not really any options to spend bitcoin, I talk about it all the time to people and bodega's. Right now it's only certain online places where you can use bitcoin as a currency but the more mainstream we get with more holders, spenders , people in general getting into bitcoin then I believe more markets will accept the currency. Now a days business follows what trends, so let's make bitcoin trend.

@_date: 2017-09-18 04:18:53
that article doesn't really have anything to do with someone casually selling their bitcoins. That article is about 2 people who have over 3,000 transactions and he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to selling narcotics...
All in all, if you sell your bitcoins, I believe you just have to report it for uncle sam because the IRS still sees bitcoin as a 'property' so you will have to pay taxes I believe on cashing out. Other than that there isn't anything to worry about..
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:17:40
No. I'm pretty sure depending where you live, the IRS will tax you on capital gains if you sell. Just keep holding until they recognize it as a currency. and if it reaches 10k this year. Next year will be 20-25k.

leaving your coins in an exchange is never entirely safe. They can easily 'lose' your coins and that's it. You need a secure safe wallet , hardware wallets are the best for this. As long as you own your private keys than you are your own bank. That's the best way of storing coins. Exchanges should only be used to buy and sell, not hold. and if you keep them on the exchange during the fork, it's basically up to them to decide what to do with it. If I understand correctly, people are still waiting for coinbase to give them their Alt coin from the fork that happened in August.

@_date: 2017-10-21 05:50:44
when the coins are in the exchange , it's the exchange that still pretty much owns them. You have to be your own bank. Get your own wallet with a private seed and save the seed, research that part because it's VERY important to keep your coins safe. When you are your own bank nobody can steal your coins. Leaving them in the exchange anything can happen and then they can just lie about what happened and boom you lost your coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:11:17
Of course people will pay 6k to enter the market. People will pay 10k to enter the market when they notice how good it is. But in general, you can put whatever money you want... 10$.... 100$...10,000$....

@_date: 2017-10-13 05:07:40
lmao yeah that's the attitude! best part of hodling is that you never have to regret anything lol and that's why it's best to just keep gradually adding more money to bitcoin regardless of the price because it doesn't matter if you HODL. We will keep reaching new highs, we are still early in the game.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:51:01
yeha I keep seeing good news, which means if these attacks didn't happen we would most likely be seeing 5k right now. I think it was an attack to make all the newbies panic sell so they can eat off them. I'm still expecting to see 5-6k before january 
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:30:45
the reason i was hoping for a guide is because the source doesn't show any of the safety measures you should take. It just tells you the risks of running the node.

again this doesn't really have anything to do with someone casually selling their bitcoins. Did you even read all the replies to understand the situation? That guy was in a unique situation, just recently out on bail. The police don't care about him selling the bitcoins or how he obtained them, they were worried about what his intentions were to do with that money because of his criminal record. They could have easily done the same thing to him if he withdrew a lot of money from the bank. And it was over a year ago so it's not a daily casual thing.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:59:30

@_date: 2017-10-13 05:01:50
technically it's still cheap if you consider the fact 1 coin can be worth 250k and more. But right now it seems expensive because it's still adapting but knowing me I'll still buy in some around 5500 just in case it keeps going up. I predict it will dip after the fork for a few days and then sky rocket to a new high again.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:46:05
bitcoin being the original coin is the most accepted worldwide with the most ATM's I believe and what not. It's accepted as a currency more than any of the other alt coins. But yeah it's true that some places only accept one or the other but most being that they accept bitcoin because of it's recognition.
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:01:32

DO NOT keep it in coinbase. They can 'steal' the split coin from you or they can hold it for a long time. It's a general rule to not store your coins in an exchange. Use the exchange to buy and or sell but do not keep it there. Wallets are free, only a hardware wallet you pay for. Look into wallets such as electrum, look around , ask around

It's not that big, many other major companies would take their place in mining bitcoin and eventually will surpass a new high with or without china. Also china tends to lie a lot and fuck with the markets so we aren't even 100% sure what they're gonna do. Seeing it rise is probably a shocker, but not really. It's rising because people are buying in on the 'dips' from the people who sold because they panicked. Basically the whales sucking up all the shrimp.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:26:00
Because china doesn't own majority of bitcoin, they probably owned around 15-20% and msot of china probably isn't even selling. They aren't that naive in my opinion. Even if bitcoin were to be ban in China I can assure you that a huge population of chinese would still be using bitcoin 'illegally' because you cannot get rid of it. Porn is ban in china but I can assure many chinese people still watch porn in china. 
edit* I would also like to say most of the people who sold were probably the innocent victims who got scared from all the FUD and they sold off thinking they would lose a lot of money.

It will drop when the fork happens. Just wait and watch. It will be entertaining. The split forked coin will gain supporters and will 'attack' this original bitcoin community to try and convince users to go to the dark side like they did with BCH and BCH is pretty useless.  But also keep in mind, it's good to own bitcoin before the fork so you can get the free split coin.

I think you are confused a bit, none of those are related to a paper wallet. Youre thinking of a regular mobile wallet which most users have. mobile wallets are generally all good for sending and recieving bitcoin but not as secure as a hardware wallet but still promising safe. People usually get hardware wallets when they're invested over 5 grand into bitcoin. But yes a regular mobile wallet shows you exactly what you have.

This probably been the case all along. but the FUD was a strong attack to make profit for themselves
edit* it's also a good chance they would make these licenses very expensive so the goverment can make some type of profit off this. Perhaps that was the plan at the same time of buying the dip. They're hungry hippos if this will be true.

Bitcoin is a currency and will be used as one when it's more worldwide recognized. Obviously the higher the price will go the more attention it will get. The more attention it will get, the more business's will accept it as a currency.

I love reading this stories to remind myself how much of a loyal hodler I am. I've been almost convinced so many times by other communities to try and invest in their coins but I never do it. It comes to my realization that those are majority all scams ran by a bunch of whales to suck up the guppies. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:50:49
Thsi is not a problem at all. it's just the miners switching coins. Overall the miners will follow the main coin.. Bitcoin... since it's still very volatile they like to switch around for more money but they will all follow bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:01:01
Just so you all know , JP Morgan is in partnership with etherium (if that's spelled correctly) which is another crypto currency like bitcoin so don't be surprised if they are investing into bitcoin by the millions

@_date: 2017-09-18 10:06:36
25%? barely 10% at this point if you consider where we are sitting at right now. The only people who actually lost that much are the ones who sold. I didn't lose anything because I did not sell anything. In fact my holdings will start turning into gains soon with or without China because bitcoin doesn't actually need China. And China probably won't even ban bitcoin. They're just going to regulate it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:34:03
you pretty much sound like the average new comer to bitcoin. That's how I sounded when it was at 3700. It felt like such a risk but look at it now. In a matter of months you can be saying the same when the price is 6-8k. I've invested 1.7k (and im broke and don't even have any savings, to be honest this practically is my savings but I'm also a little younger) but anyways my 1,700 is now 2,600 and all I did was HODL. I'd put in 1k if I were you and just hodl and gradually keep putting in more kinda like a cut from your paycheck. And if there's any dips. Put in another 1k on any big dips.

@_date: 2017-10-13 04:24:09
no, there would be no reason to sell. I rather sell when it reaches 250k. You have to understand this is the very start of this trend. Bitcoin isn't even accepted as a currency yet in many companies. Give it some more time to adapt.

I wish it would so I can buy in at that cheap price!!!! This is why a lot of FUD is spread during the fork. People trying to drop the price as low as possible so they can buy in. few weeks ago we had one of the biggest attacks on bitcoin from jp morgan and China and price still didn't drop below 3k so no way will it drop below 3k from the fork. Don't forget, we already had a fork in august and guess what happened after the fork? The price went up (: 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:12:45
you always hear people talk about the dip for a reason, and that's to buy it and hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:52:58
it's just the technology behind bitcoin. It's so advanced that it will be adopted worldwide. Many of us believe this which is why we hodl. It already is taking place on a minor scale. It won't start getting real big until bitcoins market cap reaches one trillion which will be sooner than expected. We already are almost at 100 billion

@_date: 2017-10-13 05:57:25
yeah 5k is like rubbing some dirt off my shoulder. We are so confident about bitcoin that it needs to hit 10k to give a nice decent rush down our viens but then even 10k won't really be much. I think this will keep going until we actually do go to the moon
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:07:15
you should probably do a little research then because banksy makes pieces for the people. In fact, any of his pieces on random walls are easily worth $50,000+ some pieces go for more than 200k and he doesn't even sell them. He does it for free and people steal his art work from walls and literally take down walls to keep his pieces.

Bitcoin has no restrictions, it's envitable dude. Just because some goverment decides to create some rule out of their ass doesn't mean anything. This is exactly why bitcoin is revolutionary because it's giving freedom back to the people. No matter where you live, you can still use it because bitcoin doesn't follow any border rules or any bullshit rules. Bitcoin is for everybody and the only rules it follows are mathematical.  
  
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:48:19

I as well get stressed whenever it goes up because I think to myself like shit I should have bought more but I don't wanna buy now cause I rather wait for a little dip and then it ends up rising again as well as my blood pressure. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:05:45
I hope so as well! But I think it would take at least 2 years for bigger markets to start accepting bitcoin. Some do such as microsoft and a lot of local places accept bitcoin. I guess it all depends how much attention bitcoin gets. If it goes up to 20k than I'm sure LOTS of markets will accept it because of it's high demand. It also depends on us as individuals, spread the word to your local places. I sometimes put up bitcoin stickets around my city. It's all about getting the bitcoin symbol out there. The more it's seen the more attention it gets.  I only been here since August and I've seen so much shit go down in this community lol it's awesome and addicting.

those were probably them 3k limit buy orders that bounced it back up. Who knows how many more limits are left to keep it arise. but even without china, bitcoin can easily reach new highs with other people taking over the mining operations
@_date: 2018-07-14 10:30:35
You aren't thinking clearly because you probably only invested to try and make quick money. You didn't mention anything about the technology behind cryptocurrency which is where the value really is. The volatile price right now has nothing to do with what's actually going on. It's just sharks and fish playing a game. Adoption already is happening, New ATM's all over the world and new stores accepting BTC almost everyday. When this picks up all over the world, it becomes less volatile. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:41:34

I agree, even without china that means so much more room for other miners to jump in ! Really nobody should have panic sell because china only owns about 20% of bitcoin and I bet you a lot of the people in china didnt even sell! They aren't dumb. They know how to access the market regardless if it's ban or not.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:58:32
you are better off just buying bitcoin directly. That's the point of bitcoin anyway, to be your own bank. I wouldn't do it that way because their way is probably designed to benefit themselves the most. As to where you can just directly buy bitcoin without that worry.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:54:51
Nov is when the fork takes place. That's when you will have to be very careful. A lot of fake atricles will be spread and the people who don't know much about bitcoin end up taking loses and end up being manipulated by the FUD. In Nov there's a chance of a fork and a fork will split the coin in to 2. Bitcoin will remain but there will be a new coin and that's when a lot of FUD articles and bullshit will be spread to try and convince people to buy into the new coin claiming it's the real bitcoin and sadly a lot of people get sucked into it.
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:30:58

@_date: 2017-10-21 04:46:27
I can remember buying in when 4800 was the new peak and it never reached 5k and instead dippe down to 3600 for days. I was a little worried like a fucking NOOB so I didn't buy more and next thing you know this bitch went past 5k and now we are at 6k. So even if it dips under what you paid for, I wouldn't panic. Bitcoin always finds a way to reach an all new time high and will keep doing so for many years as long as our community stays strong through each and every hardfork attack.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:24:47
Those people are so delusional lol. Just look at this sub and how almost every day you see new BTC ATM's being put up all around the globe. To my understanding BCH doesn't even have one ATM up anywhere. It's pretty obvious who's going to be revolutionary.

well this is kinda dumb. In any kind of disaster currency completely changes and anything can become a curerncy such as cigarettes.
And as time progresses our nations will be better built to not lose power during storms like Maria and bitcoin will be more accessible in many ways. People are forgetting bitcoin is a CODE. Codes can be programmed and used in many ways which is why the future has so much to offer for bitcon.

The higher the price goes usually means the less volatile it becomes. The higher the price goes usually means markets will follow the trend and will start accepting bitcoin. Everyday we are seeing people post pictures of new places that accept bitcoin. We are just waiting for a really big one such as amazon. Bitcoin ATM's are being distrubuted all across the globe and are becoming more popular so that's a good sign. Adaption still needs to take place in other words. and I believe the fees would get lower with the more miners that come in but I'm not to sure about that 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:38:03
great point!
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:14:21
I feel like you guys are stuck in the past. Since 3k we never saw any big drops, This community alone is 300k+ users strong and bitcoin is sort of 'trending' everyone hears about it and almost knows about it. I only see small drops happening ranging from 100-500 dollars with the same kind of increases. But we are still at a all time low for bitcoin. We are under valued and bitcoin can easily be worth quadruple than what it's worth now

Sounds like you played yourself and you act on impulse. No need to sell out. Just hold, holding doesn't mean hold for 1 week. Sometimes you need to hold for weeeeks/months or years if you believe in the future especially when being attacked the way we are now
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:28:22
consider it an attack on bitcoin, after the fork a lot of confusion will happen as the coin splits and the new alt coin will try and claim to be the real coin convincing users to sell their btc and buy the new coin. During this time is when the dip happens but this is a tricky situation. The attack can be succesful and drain bitcoin so it's our job to support bitcoin as much as we can such as running your own bitcoin node on your computer. You should do this, the more people running nodes the better we can fight off the attack. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:52:09
But goverment can work with these coins in the sense of tracking transactions and making busts on illegal things. Just because they can't control it doesn't make it a threat. It can still help the goverment.

selling is only worth it if you really can time the market. OTherwise you'll end up selling while the price keeps going up and then you have to buy in at a higher price and then it might drop and you lose when you could have just hold and profit the entire time. selling is only good when you can really time it well. And buying, well always buy the dips. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:12:38

Thanks for giving the numbers mate. I've only seen one of them but scimming through it, it does seem to be outdated knowledge wise. I think a new appearance would be great personally especially because of the experience Andreas gained as a talker and pretty much representation of bitcoin.  
  
It's a good time because Joe will definitely address the crash for entertainment purposes and Andreas will just respond with logic about the technology, something Joe will probably be more open about because he seems to be learning a lot lately about technology which is why I think he's bringing Andreas back.

Thanks a lot pale for the advice. I was mainly hoping to get into the stocks instead of the currencies. Just one question, Since I work mostly at night (11pm to 7am five nights a week) on the east coast (NYC) is trading still possible during these hours? I plan to do this whilst on my night shift because I can totally put countless hours into it without stressing myself out since I'm on duty regardless, So i wouldn't be hurting my free time. I will definitely invest whatever I am okay with losing until I reach a point where I decide to quit or until I learn enough to advance.
And I will check out that link tonight, thanks again. I know I have to learn through trial and error but it's always nice to get a little head start from someone with some knowledge. I always appreciate those who spread knowledge oppose to selling it.  That being said, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 09:16:24
Thanks for an answer. So basically it's not advised to look at it as a stock trade. But I do want to try it as a hobby since I work over night hours full time. I have time  on my hands every night to look into it. I flaw in education but I don't flaw in doing research. Not sure if you have any knowledge on this but as a beginner in trading I wanted to use the app "robin hood" which has a zero fee on the trades you do but it's mostly based on penny stocks which I figure is a good way for me to start since I wouldn't be losing much. I just find it hard in finding a way to start without having to invest a lot as a beginner 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:52:11
