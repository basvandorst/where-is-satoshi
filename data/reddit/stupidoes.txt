I put a few thousand into bitcoin in the beginning of 2013.  I'm still up!

He was trading thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin and ignoring licensing and reporting requirements.  Yes, that's a crime.

If you are transacting over certain amounts, you have to report it and you have to get licensed.  BurtW was ignoring the regulations.  
  
When they first went public with their story, Burt's wife made a blog post outlining what happened and basically admitted that they were breaking these laws.  She spelled out how they had large amounts of cash on hand because Burt had been selling a lot of bitcoin in person lately.  She basically told everyone "I don't know anything about regulations because we ignore them".  It was hella derpy.
  
You won't find that account on her website any longer, but you can use the wayback machine to see it: 
   
She admits they were breaking the laws and appears to think nothing of it.  Now they're trying to use this story to make money on the speaking circuit.  I'd love to see one of those talks.

I have looked into this one and they had a great case and that is why the defendant made a plea deal.
  
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

I think the best way to communicate with you is to talk like you.
  
**Burt broke the law and *they* caught him so he paid *them* off.**  
  
How did I do?
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:13:56
Just search for the word "cash", it comes up multiple times, but you should read the whole thing to truly understand the stupidity of it.
  
I should also mention that I do not agree with taxes, but there are lots of laws I don't agree with and I don't run around breaking them just because I disagree.
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:38:51
You really didn't get my reply to you, this is hilarious and sad.
  
Do you really not understand why Burt paid them bitcoin\cash?
@_date: 2015-09-18 00:45:26
That's the narrative he would like you to believe but I know more about this case.  He took a deal in exchange for the dropping of charges and other things an that deal is currently sealed.  It would be a bad investment to bank on that staying sealed.  
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:16:19
I'm having a hard time finding sympathy.  He got caught laundering money and had to plea, why should I feel bad for him?  
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:31:31
Name checks out.  Al Capone was put in jail for tax evasion and not for the plethora of other crimes he committed.
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:28:57
This is a lot like "Ross Ulbricht didn't try to commit murder because nobody was killed"
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:45:05
How was it randomly generated?
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:49:19
I agree, I would have used it too.  I just find it interesting you used *something* to randomly generate your username instead of just picking one on your own.  What utility was it?
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:21:35
Your comment history is full of ignorant assumptions and you do act on them intellectually so I am hesitant to interact with you given the high probability of there being little reward in doing so.  But I will try, just a little.
  
There is a thing called precedent and it is integral to our legal climates around the world.
  
If the government started issuing notices to people breaking the law, they would be putting the onus on themselves to notify people that they are breaking the law before they can act on it.  This creates an enormously bad precedent that does not end well for anyone.  If you can't see the implications for that, I'm sorry, I can't help you.
  
Furthermore, these people owned businesses prior to this and had general knowledge about running a business and tax implications.  Regardless, ignorance is not an excuse in the eyes of the law.
@_date: 2015-09-17 23:03:54
I agree to an extent.  But BurtW is not a victim here, he knowingly broke the law over a course of at least months, [probably years]( and now he is trying to garner sympathy.  I have zero respect for people who know the consequences for breaking the rules but let greed guide their actions and then cry fowl about it.  
  
How much demonstrating was he out doing against the laws he disagrees with prior to his arrest?
  
Has he ever ran for office in an attempt to put himself in a position to try and make change?
  
How has he tried to change things other than ignoring laws he doesn't agree with?
  
I have a lot of respect for people who break unjust laws at their own expense in order to bring about awareness, but that is not the case here.  His motives were profit driven and he got caught.  And now he's trying to go on speaking tours to profit from it!  hilarious

The point is that just because the charges were dropped doesn't mean that they weren't valid.  Just like no bodies doesn't mean that Ulbricht didn't try to have people murdered.  I knew that would get downvoted around here because of the hard-on for Ulbricht in this sub but the downvotes also expose the bias as well.
  
Also, there were victims, their families appeared at his trial and gave their stories.
@_date: 2015-09-17 23:24:52
Well then you should investigate the case and understand the topic.  The feds had BurtW by the balls and they offered him a good deal which he took.  When BurtW says they stole the money, he means he gave it to them because he didn't want to go to jail or fight a case he had no chance of winning.
@_date: 2015-09-17 23:14:19
OH!  Did you used to play TFC back in the 90s?
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:09:26
That sounds perfect to me.  The last thing I want is for my financial information to be publicly accessible.  I want the system to be audit-able but I want it to end there, because people do bad things.
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:14:32
This source is Burt's wife's blog, a post that you can only find using the way back machine.  She lays out perfectly how they were breaking the law and how long they had been doing it for.  The only question is the exact dollar amounts: 


  


  


  
So this was much more than a hobby like his wife tries to assert.  Burt had an unusually large amount of cash on hand because of selling bitcoins.  And more than half of it was from trading bitcoins.  And he had been doing it for months.  This is coming from people who only transact in cash and own other businesses.  So they are aware of tax laws and reporting requirements and they are using various systems that allow them to obfuscate their activity.  It seems to me that Burt and his wife knew they were breaking the law and they just didn't expect to get caught, probably because they haven't been caught before.
  
Feel free to chime in with your real identity, Burt.  I posted this again because the edgy anarcho capitalists buried it.  I'd love to discuss this with you.

You need all that extra information for traditional financial markets because these markets are not driven by natural market forces and the participants are not equal.  Without that information, you don't know when it is sick and when it is healthy and when you should act, if at all. 
  
Bitcoin allows equal participation and you don't need to know any of that to know if it is healthy.  The things you need to know are there for everyone to see.  Your argument is an argument I have heard from frustrated market analysts who can't apply their traditional methods to bitcoin and therefor they declare it is broken or inferior.  I see all of this as a benefit to bitcoin, not a detractor.
  
In the bitcoin world, a person unable to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin from a place that accepts it is as big a problem as some guy trying to transfer 500 million dollars to another address, they are equally important and a sign that something needs fixing if they can't do it.  And that is just plain beautiful!
