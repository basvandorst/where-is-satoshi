Seems to me that this is their tactic, to make Apple-Pay the safe alternative.
Once they implement BTC of course, which they wont until they have all banks tied to their system and all contracts regarding "cryptos" have expired.

I think that if people like me could go to an ATM downtown, where others can see me withdraw fiat, using my phone/BTC, should create a public interest.
In addition, if I have a friend with me, that does not own any BTC, they might be impressed. Thus the interest for BTC would increase as well as adoption.
Mainly I could go to H&amp;M or Sephora that does not accept BTC and be a customer, because of a two way ATM.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:27:27
Regardless if Google has a fee or not for credit cards, does not matter. For Google, Bitcoin users is a target group for marketing, the bigger we get the more they want us. To them it would not cost anything to integrate Bitcoin, after all we would just become another revenue through advertisements.

Does not seem likely, most ATM's these days have a withdrawal limit and it seems to be to small of an amount.
You could also take the cash from your latest sell and go buy Bitcoins so that could be "money laundering"..?
Still does not make sense with that pretense.

All pools should have a built in cap to prevent a 50%+ attack, managing those in the pool.
This of course to prevent a loss of value in Bitcoin, since they do profit by preventing this.
Now I am not sure this safeguard would ever be built in, but I surely hope so.

That is an awesome way to say, that you can also withdraw money from your bitcoin address.

A two way ATM, placed in Dubai, São Paulo or Hong Kong would not be regulated by US law.
I understand that Americans might be scared regarding this, but for me living outside this jurisdiction. I only care about ~~your~~ American regulation since it will affect the value of BTC over here.
I wonder how the ATM makers reason regarding this and regarding two way ATM's?

So mainly, reading between the lines, the guys behind the ATM's are scared of theft?
Converting Bitcoin to fiat, and fiat to Bitcoin should balance it out (ATM programming).

You should talk to Safaricom, that launched the M-Pesa, the dominant payment option in Kenya and Tanzaneia.

I see your point.
Specially since I understand that the stockmarket is based on the monetary system. Yet I keep wondering, hypothetically, if there is a great crash or rather when it happens. Huge companies might survive specially the companies that integrate technologies like Bitcoin. I do suspect that Apple and Google would be companies that could do this. Do you think there at some point would be a transition from Dollar to Bitcoin, specially seeing as even the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), invested in Coibase?
