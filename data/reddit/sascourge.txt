The worse they behave, the more people will ask the government to act on their behalf, further solidifying the state's belief that they need to ban this bitcoin scam money.

Don't want to disclose your holdings, don't be a politician.   Libertarian views still in tact.

He probably did not forsee an end to net neutrality either.  ISPs will start charging carrier fees for data to exchanges, or fees for any encrypted data calling it a "service".

It makes pretty crappy currency if it is never used

It has more to do with people shorting the future.  There isnt much of a way to short bitcoin afaik.

That being the point.  I'm sure we will end up with some wall-street cryoto product just like the synthetic cdo... bunches of coins bundled together, and then sold on the futures market, then those long bets all get rebundled into a synthetic product, and sold.  Then the 2nd tier of long bets get moved into another product and now you have 3 times the leverage for failure that the original coin had.
That will be what blows up crypto.

Yes, the dollar is the currency of the entire world.  Don't think so?  Go to random country xxx, and offer USD cash to make purchases from any street vendor.  85% chance they will prefer it to their own fiat.

I like this idea.  Says, KSats, Megasats and Gigasats.  Has the benefit of going divisions the public already knows.

As far as my wife is concerned, it may as well be 70000

If this sub is happy it's probably time to sell
