This isn't an option, the IRS is already after user account information from Coinbase and others


How will bitcoin ever be non-taxable, or unable to be taxed by the US government?

It's not fear. He does not know what bitcoin is.

Why do absolutely all of these jackals talk over each other? This is painful to listen to.

Based on what a CPA had told me cryptocurrencies are filed as assets, therefore using either LIFO or FIFO does obviously apply here. Whether LIFO or FIFO is your choice as a client/tax payer. I would just get a 2nd opinion or force yourself to learn the ins and outs and file yourself.

Eventually CNBC has to be right. About something. Anything.

Any security experts here? 
Let’s say you choose to sign a message with a BTC wallet... I realize this is possibly a loss of privacy each time. But is there any other downside or risk factors from signing a message? Does the chosen message itself matter from a security perspective?

People don't care about money?
@_date: 2019-08-12 16:22:34


I wonder what this means and how it is defined?
If I have a certain amount of money (that you did not expect) and it's enough to single handedly move the market to my will you would call this manipulation?

Bitcoin $33,000 February ?

You're right. Dirty little secret: most people regardless of their net worth are attempting to live above their means. For example; johnny depp is essentially bankrupt because he owns a horse ranch and 14 houses. And yachts. Dude is a joke.
OP: did you set a budget and account for every penny that goes out? If you did this you'd know damn well putting $5,000 towards bitcoin means very little in the grand scheme of things. Why the hell not?

No but environmentalists told me that your internet Monopoly money is obliterating fresh air and clean water. Link is propaganda, y’all brainwashed.

Not all bubbles are the same size. Not all bubbles completely destroy the industry.

This is the most easily acceptable and welcoming explanation of digital currency I've listened in on to date. Thanks!

It's not a dilemma at all. This will be the first black friday where I'm actually going to buy something. Not a TV from The Wal or something but instead, bitcoin. People in my personal life will think I'm throwing money down the toilet, but at least what I'm purchasing has a chance of being worth more as time progresses. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:02:08
What the IRS wants, it gets, yes?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:09:25
Every single time I have bought bitcoin the price tanked. You should totally buy right now.

Horrible interface: kraken
Gets compromised often: kraken
Laggy deposits and withdrawals: kraken
Literally pick any other exchange.

Just take anything Gates says about Cryptocurrencies and substitute the words "US dollars".
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:20:06
So there's 1,012,449 "readers" but 19 comments in here?
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:39:14
Strikes me as a little odd. Million people. less than 2 dozen comments.
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:36:21
I don't think so, numberguy
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:55:27
That doesn't negate anything I typed.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:16:04


Uhh ok. Is there something keeping women from researching finance and buying cryptocurrencies?
Otherwise this was an unusually positive article.
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:09:47


It's not the number of buyers it's the total $ amount of the buys
