There is more good news from South Africa as major payment gateway PayFast enables bitcoin access to over 30,000 online merchants, adding it as a payment option to its platform.
The company has partnered with bitcoin exchange BitX to process the payments, allowing sellers to receive South African local currency (rand, or ZAR) and avoid bitcoin price volatility.
Jonathan Smit, Managing Director and founder of PayFast, said:
“We are not really sure what will happen with bitcoin going forward as it is still early days for the ‘currency’, but we’re interested in contributing to the ecosystem and seeing where it goes.”
He told CoinDesk that PayFast had been asked in the past about accepting bitcoin, but didn’t want to be involved in the volatility. The partnership with BitX drove his decision and it was the synergy between the two companies that allowed the process to happen, and swiftly.
“Being a techie, the concept of a cryptocurrency and how it works fascinates me, and while I have been following bitcoin for a while, I’m not really an early adopter, so only very recently have I actually acquired and used bitcoin myself.”
“At this stage we view bitcoin as a payment mechanism rather than a currency,” he added.

Germany-based digital currency bitcoin ATM and point-of-sale (POS) solution provider BitXatm has announced a new partnership that will find the company shipping 1,000 units to the US in a bid to build the country’s largest bitcoin ATM network.
For the initiative, BitXatm will partner with Los Angeles-based CryptVision, a startup that itself is seeking to build the largest network of bitcoin ATMs around the globe. As part of the deal, CryptVision will become the exclusive provider of BitXatms in the US and Canada.
Sergey Yesayan, president of CryptVision, framed the move as one that will find the new company moving quickly to gain a foothold in the bitcoin market, saying:
“In terms of positioning our products all over the country, we’re planning to have most of them in place by the end of the year, and are looking for location partners in shopping malls, restaurants and night clubs.”
Yesayan said that the bitcoin ATM units will be available for free to qualified operators, with the qualification process for operators beginning 25th July. CryptVision plans to treat the units as vending machines and manage the associated financial responsibilities and licensing.
The announcement follows BitXatm’s May upgrade to its Sumo Pro ATM product, and was issued at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), a two-day community event being held in downtown Chicago.

Banks are reluctant to work with bitcoin, that fact has been well known in the community for some time. Until now, though, few concrete reasons have been given as to why.
New statements from a senior banking practitioner in Australia working in anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF), compliance could go some way to providing an explanation.
Banks around the world, particularly in the US, have been closing down accounts of bitcoin startups and even bitcoin-accepting businesses for over a year now. Even those that do work with bitcoin businesses are reluctant to be named in the media.
More conspiratorial theories say bitcoin’s destiny is to replace banks, and banks fear the competition. The real answer, however, could be the more mundane one of regulatory risk.

Bitcoin is not anonymous. It is easily tracked via addresses, similar to your credit card transactions. Every bitcoin exchange requires you to set up an account with your info which can be used to track where and when you send your btc through the blockchain.﻿

Latvian airline airBaltic has decided to eliminate its controversial transaction charge on bitcoin purchases.
Earlier this week, the firm became the first European airline to accept bitcoin for flight bookings. The news was covered by digital currency news outlets and even some mainstream media, putting Latvia firmly on the cryptocurrency map.
However, enthusiasm soon waned after it emerged that the airline was still charging its standard €5.99 fee on bitcoin transactions – the same as customers paying with a credit card.

Listings, payments in fiat
Merchants’ actual interaction with bitcoin will be minimal. Prices on a seller’s website will still be listed in rand and users will be charged that amount, whatever the current exchange rate. According to the company’s blog, merchants will still need to manually enable bitcoin in their account settings, as they do with other existing payment options.
They will still, however, enjoy bitcoin’s advantages like low processing fees, no chargebacks or reversals, speed, and international availability.
Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of BitX, said he was excited about the deal, which brought the benefits of digital currency to a much broader market and represented a major leap in potential volume for his company.
He said:
“At BitX we continuously aim to make it easier for individuals and businesses to buy, sell, spend and receive their bitcoin, and this partnership is a testimony of our commitment to this promise.”

If you fancy nabbing new tech by leveraging your Bitcoin wallet, another online retailer has just joined the fray. CEO Michael Dell alerted the masses via Twitter that his company would begin accepting the digital currency, claiming that the outfit is "world's largest ecommerce business" to do so. The device maker is partnering with Coinbase to power its transactions, and those looking to snag a new Alienware rig will earn a discount when forking over Bitcoin for payment.

The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) has released a copy of proposed "codes, rules, and regulations" for companies that buy and sell bitcoin and other virtual currencies roughly a year after the agency announced an inquiry into regulating bitcoin.
The proposal, which outlines requirements for a special "BitLicense" (truly), will be entered into the record on July 23rd. The proposed rules apply to businesses that buy, sell, transfer, store, or maintain custody or control of customers' bitcoins, as well as companies that convert fiat currency to virtual currency on behalf of merchants. They will also apply to companies that convert virtual currencies into other types of virtual currencies, as well as issue virtual currency.
They do not apply to bitcoin miners, the programmers who maintain the bitcoin network in exchange for virtual currency.
Under the proposal, companies with a BitLicense must hold in reserve an equal amount of virtual currency, and in the same type of virtual currency, as their customers deposit. They must also keep records on their customers' real names and addresses, disclose to customers the risks of using virtual currency, and report suspected fraud. They must also appoint a compliance office and a computer security officer, among other provisions.
The rules also leave some questions undecided, such as how much capital a virtual currency business must keep on hand.
The public will have 45 days to comment, and the rules will likely go into effect in September.
"EACH FIRM MUST HOLD VIRTUAL CURRENCY OF THE SAME TYPE AND AMOUNT AS ANY VIRTUAL CURRENCY OWED OR OBLIGATED TO A THIRD PARTY."
Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of Financial Services, has been clever about online outreach around the progressive initiative. He allowed Reddit to ask him anything, then posted the proposed rules on Reddit and Twitter.
"We recognize that – as the first state to put forward specially tailored rules for virtual currency firms – continued public feedback will be an important part of finalizing this regulatory framework," Lawsky said in a statement. "We look forward to carefully and thoughtfully reviewing public comments on our proposal."
New York has a robust financial regulatory infrastructure due to the proximity of the finance industry, which means it tends to set the tone for financial policy in other states.
Bitcoin businesses reacted positively to the proposal for the most part.
"We take every possible measure to ensure that itBit protects consumers, prevents abuse and provides security," Charles Cascarilla, CEO of itBit, a Singapore bitcoin trading company that recently moved to New York, said in a statement. "The proposed BitLicense aligns with our current standards and practices, and we have every intention to be in compliance with the final guidelines."

The core software managed by the foundation contains instructions that let computers communicate with one another to verify transactions on bitcoin’s public ledger, called the blockchain. Another program enables users to conduct those transactions.
Software upgrades are made through an informal system of mostly part-time developers who communicate in Internet chat rooms. Gavin Andresen, the foundation’s chief scientist, was until May the only paid coder working on bitcoin. Online discussions sometimes devolve into virtual shouting matches, according to Andresen.
This year, the bitcoin network processed between $20 million and $580 million per day in transactions, according to the data aggregated on blockchain.info.
“This is not sustainable,” said Mike Hearn, one of bitcoin’s core developers. “You can’t have an infrastructure held together by chewing gum and sticky tape and people who work evenings and weekends.”
Software upgrades have helped ward off hacking and increased commercial utility. A change in March, for example, improved the security of transactions conducted through online merchants by adapting bitcoin software to the Internet’s existing system for authenticating websites.
