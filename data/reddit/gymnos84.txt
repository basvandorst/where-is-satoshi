I wake up this morning to headlines of "Crypto crash greater than dot-com crash!" Then look at BTC and it is barely changed. The press is employing scare tactics against BTC by using "crypto" as an analog, which it ain't. I do not believe this is not intentional.

This, exactly. The list of early leaders that were knocked off by a better latecomer is a long one. WordPerfect, Visicalc, CP/M, Betamax, MySpace come to mind quickly. Bitcoin, however dominant now, is not assured to stay that way.
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:23:11
A recent article I read states that a block size increase makes running full nodes less practical, and thus serves to concentrate control with the miners. I strongly feel that decentralization is a prime tenet of bitcoin, and that centralization for whatever reason will lead to bitcoin's demise.
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:09:28
Any cryptocurrency is a store of value only to the extent that its users agree upon it. It is market-based. Just as a fiat currency can crash, so could Bitcoin if its users and hodlers lose confidence and/or utility. Scarcity is a different issue. Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, which gives Bitcoin scarcity (a good thing). Other coins may approach the issue differently.

Not that hard. I did it by memorizing three strings of four words each. That makes it easier, especially if you add a bit of mental rhythm to your mental recitations. I now feel pretty confident that I've got my 12 words permanently memorized, though I recite them silently in my mind every day just to be sure.

I disagree. As an analogy, consider Windows, the desktop operating system. (The analogy is weak, since Windows is a proprietary product.) Anyway, I can proceed along a path as Windows is improved, modified or otherwise changed by its developers. Some changes will be for better, others for worse, and some will be debated by different groups of users. Still, Windows is Windows. If I want to move to ChromeOS or Linux or roll my own OS, I have full freedom to do so, but by doing so, I will be leaving the Windows train behind. It would be not only disingenuous to call "GymnOS" an "upgrade" to Windows just because it's a desktop OS that I like better, but also fraudulent, because it is no longer Windows.

No, of course not. It should go without saying that bigger blocks leads to centralization of power by making it more resource intensive (read:expensive) to run a full verifying node.

IMHO, bigger blocks will probably be needed at some point, but not now.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:06:34
No, I do not support the hard fork. Mainly because I do not support larger blocks at this time. We need to (a) develop off-chain scaling solutions; (b) keep the resource cost low for running a full node; (c) not allow special interests, such as signers of the New York Agreement, to centralize control over Bitcoin direction. Forking with bigger blocks, especially with no replay protection, is not in the best interest of Bitcoin.

You don't own any coins on Coinbase. You hold an IOU. Fact.

I think Coinbase charges 1 or 1.5% so the rate isn't bad. Do your homework on any trade before making your decision. If I remember, exchanges that take PayPal charge more. Coinbase promotes itself as a wallet, but there is no insurance or recourse if Coinbase fails or is cracked. Rule  of Bitcoin is, "if you don't personally have the private key, you don't own the coins." And with Coinbase, you don't have the private key.

Using PayPal puts the Bitcoin seller at risk, so that risk factor is built in to the exchange fee charged. PayPal transactions can be reversed, but not Bitcoin transactions.

The average person doesn't see the issue or problem with leaving Bitcoin on an exchange. That's why we need to keep drumming, "not your keys, not your Bitcoins." Otherwise, the next exchange hack or failure that comes along will be blamed on Bitcoin, not the risky exchange model. This has happened before and will (probably) happen again.

Lost coins will never go on the market for sale. That alone will tend to push price upward. Market price will always be based on bid/ask like any market. If, for example, only 1000 coins were for sale at any given time, the price would skyrocket with all the buyers wishing to acquire those coins. In other words, markets are priced on what's for sale, rather than what exists in the world. That's how sea shells were once able to be used for currency, despite the billions that exist in the world.

If keeping transaction fees low is the most appealing aspect of Bitcoin for you, you should have probably gone on to greener pastures a long time ago.
