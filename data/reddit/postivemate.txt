@_date: 2017-12-11 03:48:00

that was nuuuuuts hahahaa i loved it
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:58:46
omg thats awesome, ty alot :D
i was wondering why im only seeing max 10 btc walls
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:48:43
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:37:25
ok so if u buy at 10k, then sell at 15k (lets not count with fees to make the math easier) then u make 500$ profit. then u buy again at 12k, ride to 20k thats another 800$ profit. thats 1300$ profit in comparsion to 1000$ that you would make from holding from 10k to 20k
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:46:06
where do u see that? im on gdax but cant see that amount on sell wall haha
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:03
from githud or github, i will try to find it again and post here
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:33:20
tbh man i got scammed too much that i just dont give a fuck anymore lol. cant bother with the shipping of the wallet etc.. just looking to use my phone as the bank :P

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:52:19

any reason why ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:59:47
well myself id pay even 80% if i know its my only chance to get those 10btc :P (it would hurt, yes. but 20k is better than 0)
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:06:24
mt gox was a BIG exchange that was hacked and made those who had their bitcoins in lose it all. search it up, kind of interesting ^^
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:55:18

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:35:42

@_date: 2017-12-06 14:51:10
i've been waiting to say it for a long time, but after this rise today i can finally say it.
Bitcoin will never reach less than 10k again, train is leaving way too fast haha
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:15:08
about a week ago there was a 1200 sell wall at around 18k i think, it got eaten in 3mins (there was a video on twitter ima try to find it)
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:58:44
na no point lol, no way they will give it back :p
just sucks cause i was so excited to finally get some etc and then this happend , but atleast not a bigger lose
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:22:30
sooo obviously im posting because i didnt make this transaction, its electrum wallet and i have 2fa. what is this ? 
bought 120$ worth today. and this transaction just apperead as if i sent to that address, but i didnt
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:56:37
ye charge me 40$ for a 2$ transaction is very logical, what ever haha :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:07:29
what special in 4/1 other than 1/1?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:48:41
ye.. i thought i got hacked but as the guy says i guess i paid for the 2fa.. i never saw a company that is charging for that but ok
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:47:40
Ye but say i have 3000$ worth of bitcoin in that wallet. all good and nice, how can i be sure that if i get virus on the pc, it wont just send the btc to another address? 
and i really cba with phsyical wallet, the shipping and stuff will just give me headache
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:56:01
lol so by what i see it says 
Pay every 20 transactions:	0.0001 BTC/tx     	0.002 BTC total
but i paid just straight 40$ worth of btc in the first ever transaction i made, lol.
well ty again alot for the help , i guess i desreve this lose
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:15:17
ohhh, our dates in israel are different, so i was seeing 4/1 and 1/1 as the same month, just 3days difference haha
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:23:33
why is there so much difference in prices in the exchanges? bitfnex is at 9,160, bitstamp 9,300, gdax - 9,500 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:36
that will never EVER happen. there is no way its going below 9k 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:01:07
tbh it doesn't matter, he would find out the prices eventually as bitcoin is reaching more and more media, my grandfather asked me how to buy one last week :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:56:51
when do they wake up? timezones are hardddd
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:15:43
ohhh, our dates in israel are different, so i was seeing 4/1 and 1/1 as the same month, just 3days difference haha
thanks for letting me know tho guys =]
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:04:05
Idk man it sounds so hard to me.. its so annoying cause i have these 3000$ sitting here doing nothing, and this is such a good opportuanity but im scared to buy and just "hope" to not get fucked
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:47:34
Holy fuck thats trash. i ended up moving the btc i had to a new wallet cause i got scared that i got hacked even with 2fa. they should really say this before i activate. lame as fuck. ty for the help tho. (so ended up losing 50$ total from the 2fa cost and the fees, out of the 120$ i bought, lmfao)
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:56:28
how are u down 80bucks? did u sell? i still have as much bitcoin as i had yesterday, lol.
u are NOT in a lose, untill u sell. Same goes for profit.
Right now all of us have bitcoin, not $$. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:06
i'm 16 yo, got around 3000$ to invest in bitcoin and need help. i've been scammed out of 1bitcoin around a year ago, cause i left it in blockchain.org and it was fucking stupid, need help to secure the bitcoin i will buy. will pay for someone who can completetly help.
i really cba with physical wallet like legder or the other one, perfer to use electrum as the wallet.
Sorry for english, not my main lang
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:50:26
what the fuck is that? how is that logical? i did atransaction to another wallet and sent around 2$ worth, just to check, and paid 40$ extra?
its not even about the money lose that im mad about, just explain to me how is that okay
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:51:45
uh.. i guess i was  notified and just didnt pay attention ;/
my fault.. ty for atleast letting me know.
but still, why did i pay 40$ extra when i made a 2$ transaction ? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:42:57
