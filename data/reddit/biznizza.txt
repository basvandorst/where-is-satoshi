Can you put it in a way that gives something of an actual response? I'd like to better understand how having someone advising them on accepting Bitcoin weakens them? Especially someone who is clearly in it for the long haul, a true evangelist, and someone who has been in the Bitcoin space longer than 99% of us?

The moms example is bad, they don't use reddit. But children do. Moms have things to take care of, these shit-tards from the buttcoin subreddit have no friends. 
Also take into account the wave of jealousy they must be feeling(and denying so vehemently)? It all makes sense, no money needs to be involved. Here's the other side: imagine you could prove that somekne will pay you to poo-poo Bitcoin. Think of the press and attention you could get just by being honest?

the idea is to build acceptance. the goal is to get off fiat completely and only use one system of accounting. it's not step 10 yet, it's step 1. step 1 is to make them accept it in SOME form. if they never see the value of keeping them, bitcoin will eventually lose.

well, there was a point brought up with the previous big rhino story that this particular rhino was a PROBLEM for other younger rhinos trying to mate. this rhino was specifically affecting the population numbers. they HAD to off him. so they auctioned off a "kill this rhino with your gun" thing and got a bunch of money for it. supposedly that's money to fight the poachers. fair?

I'd still like to know how volatility is solved.


... this unfortunately allows for people's time-spent on the system to become "trust." It allows shareholders much more control of the "delegation" and I feel this is a much stronger potential attack vector than "everyone has stake." 


I'm not sure how you mean. It does the exact job it was intended to do. Are you referring to electricity costs per reward?


This will be bitcoin too. Not right now because we had to figure out the "distribution" method, but it's coming. Surely the inflation will subside relatively quickly as the reward halves, right?


i can't have this peg and i'm not personally cool with it. not sure what the rest of the community thinks. I think it's asking for trouble to have this.


Don't care, as bitcoin can (and will) have this in some form or another. Frankly, this is just not a feature to me.
tl;dr: I prefer the PoW that bitcoin currently uses to an altcoin DPOS.
edit: also 16-bit identifiers(to minimize bandwidth) will have like 65,535 usable decimals. That's not the number I want. bandwidth and space are becoming cheaper every day and are already cheap enough for my consideration

ok, then i have no clue where "statistical pedantics" came from or why it was expected.
let's not use "on the chain" as the comments here have pointed out. let's use "it is visible to both participants almost immediately." So if i owed you $5, and we did a bitcoin-send, you would see it IMMEDIATELY and feel confident. Now, if it was $5million, you'd probably want to wait for a confirmation, an avg of 5 mins. if it was in the realm of $10mil, you may want to wait for two confirmations.
but my point is that the article is shite and wrong and therefore scoring is not needed.

to say that "cryptos will win and bitcoin will lose" is nuts, simply because unless a completely different paradigm is conceived, bitcoin will evolve its "currency" functions to match the best possible ideas.

volatility is being reduced. it is less volatile than last year and even less so than the year before. if it can continue on this trend, it will have much less volatility. 
add into that the fact that userbase and spendable units are increasing along with the ability to spend and receive - volatility should(i hope) be reduced even further to (more) acceptable levels. I say this because it's already acceptable to many people.

Compare with USD, CAN, JPY? Or with a company stock that does well? Certainly you wouldn't call them "ponzi schemes?" 
In fact, let's take a look at a ponzi: users buy into a central "exchanger" at some price, the price goes up(by definition, not by perceived value), and the next "money" coming in goes to the previous "buyer." This continues until there is no more buyers, and the last person who bought in is the loser. there was a "bitponzi" game that did exactly this. maybe still is. 
Whereas bitcoin's price fluctuates based on what people believe(like a stock or currency) and no one is guaranteed a free ride, even if they are not the last buyer. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:30:39
Yeah, "nobody" is really checking the TX-hashes either. there's math in place. its checked by the software. because it benefits both the miners and the network. the second there is money to be made, miners will flock to it. or in this non-existent case: away from it. the only way to make money in the system is to let the rest of the network know.
don't add extra bullshit where there is none. it's extremely childish and exposes your obvious inability to use logic and research over your personal butthurt.

@_date: 2014-12-31 21:28:57


but it IS, in retrospect. As the "scale" of bitcoins history changes, so does our perception. That's like saying the $3-$31 was not the first bubble, because the first bubble was $0.1-$0.7. It changes, and considering we have had a bubble of 200-1100, doesn't that make the 3-31 and 20-260 bubble sort of... tiny blips on the radar?

I disagree with this. Square, Circle, Bitpay, coinbase are all as easy to integrate as paypal if not easier.


This is becoming available to companies, and as we have seen, it is more likely a matter of "when." Compare to 365 days ago or even two years. Less volatility, more acceptance, etc etc.


These guys pride themselves on their ability to scale and become more efficient, yet they have still not been able to tackle credit card fees(due to all the necessary human &amp; computer work that goes into credit cards). a 2% reduction is dick to you and me, but its hundreds of millions to Bezos. 
For these reasons I consider it extremely likely that amazon will one day accept bitcoin.

no, money laundering = money laundering. 
if his emails showed that all he did was sell bitcoins, then that's fine. but his emails show he knew he was laundering money. and he also showed he knew exactly what it was being laundered for. 
i am completely stunned that you either havent read the same document as me or that you dont see how this blatant "fuck you" to our legal system has to be punished? he KNEW the law and KNOWINGLY broke it. How can there be anything more damning to him? We ALL want bitcoins to take off and for Charlie to go free, but to randomly rally behind someone who ADMITTED his wrong-doings IN WRITING? certainly you can see why i'm nervous about that.
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:28:19
it's not hate, it's disagreement. our "lower price" we are currently seeing is temporary and just a part of a more volatile cycle. they're right, it does have to increase in value(and usage of course) before it can be stable. again, I just don't count "a few weeks" as "stable" yet.

i am. i support almost every company that mentions they take bitcoin. at least one time, if i can find any use for the product. Sell sunglasses? I'll take 6 pairs. Sell Zynga bucks? I'll take $100 worth. Sell Cat Hammocks? Sorry, no cat.
I totally disagree with the notion that people just "hold to become rich." If you really think of it that way, you're not really ready for bitcoin in its current phase. You should come back when we're at version 1.0 but until then, don't use this sub as some kind of sampling pool because it isn't.

nah, he was one of the first major proponents, before Andreas and the 2nd wave of great guys. He was putting major money where his mouth was, unabashedly offered the first bitcoinstore.com (still around) and made no money simply to undercut amazon(money from btc is a different story :D ).
he put up the honeybadger billboard up in San Jose(his stomping ground) and showed his face in the media a ton before it became as big as it is today.

the math behind sha256 is unbreakable, there is no formula. 
as a basic example, there are no formulas to find relatively prime factors of ridiculously huge numbers. this goes ten-fold for guessing ridiculously high natural logarithms.
ask any math/comp-sci/NSA guy. i did. math is unique in that it requires definitive proof, not simply experimentation.
to add the bank thing: because of the previous statement about no formula existing for this stuff, then the only real way to break the system is to guess a huge number of guesses per second and see f they match up. if we are able to guess numbers in a sha256 space quickly, then we will be able to guess numbers of MUCH SMALLER spaces much faster. banks use these much smaller numbers. because of this, if bitcoin is ever CLOSE to broken, banks will have been broken long before.
it's like: if a stick of TNT can break a 5ft concrete wall, then it will definitely break a 1ft concrete wall.

i must implore you to look into exactly what it would take to guess numbers like this. it is astronomically difficult, and no linear computing system will ever succeed, even one that can attain physically "perfect" computing wherein it uses its energy for only number-guessing and expends zero other energy(such as heat). it MUST be quantum computing, if it ever happens. and if it does, the "old" encryption methods will go long before bitcoin.

it's also the result of viruses. to be fair Ive never seen an android phone with a virus either. but they're there because it's an open system. i LIKE open systems but we can't ignore the faults(at least in this case).


that's exactly what i'm saying, though. as someone who has been waiting years for a good android offering, i ask all the time. i see the frustration build over time and i just dont see it with iphone users. that could of course be perception and nothing more, but i think it has to do with smart software management, reduced instruction architecture, and a closed-OS ecosystem that mates the OS to the hardware better than android EVER could. iOS has something like... what... 8 supported devices? maybe 10? there are something like 15000 android devices that Google has to worry about, and they can't test on all of them.


... have you not used folders/groups? all my games are on one icon that expands, my money apps are on another, my music on a third, etc. 


again this is user error. i keep my MOST used icons available at the bottom for one touch from any screen, i keep my OFTEN used icons on the main screen, and the rest are folders.


sounds nice? i guess i've never needed it(on any machine. most of my machines are windows) so it doesn't speak to me personally


like what? i have NEVER seen a feature i liked. NFC, touchless gestures, command-listening mic, etc. i guess replacing keyboards had a use, but now apple does that too.


no one is arguing that. i'm arguing that despite the closed-ness, apple's products are THE BEST i have ever seen a company ever put out and I would give my left nut for google to make phones that are as nice. they are literally so good, that I kept buying new ones as they came out. i literally said to myself "fuck, that was so good, i want to see what they do next." While i have felt this way about many of googles/Motorola's products, it was never phones.
i mentioned theyre the best because the discussion is about apple pay and my comment was that apple is SO GOOD that if anyone could make it work, it's them. we need to treat them as a more credible threat than the OP/article suggest

disagree and here's why:
first off, "money" is a tool to keep "current" with our debts, hence "currency." Bitcoin may not act the same as money, but it is absolutely a  good tool for currency. Right?
second off, there are just so many parallels to draw betweent his and the beginning of TCP/IP. It used to be "fringe" and had no application to the average dummy. but eventually basic email protocols gave way to awesome websites and databases and twitter and shit that are FAR ADVANCED past the original creation they sit on. In all the ways people didn't see that coming, the same thing is true for bitcoin/blockchain techs. It is still early but people are creating new applications and the general public is slowly warming to the idea. Let's call it money and currency and fuck what he dummies say... they'll come around as sheep always do.

it forges a transaction hash, not a ledger. and that's only for 10 mins until someone else hopefully rejects it. and it also needs to correctly get the rest of the block's hash. after that, it needs to keep effing with blocks(all correctly, reducing their odds dramatically) until the rest of the network accepts it. you don't need 51%, it simply increases your odds.

this is probably my biggest complaint and it's one that reaches throughout their entire company. 


lets stick to iphones. their laptops are more or less BSD and are plenty customizeable.
here's what I have found, though: android devices all suck. i've seen almost every one and i always try the new ones since i want options away from apple. they are the crappiest cheapest pieces of plastic i have ever held. they scream "morotola" or "samsung."
... but their form-factors are probably not the key feature we here in discuss. it turned into a big deal for me sometime around the iphone4(it just feels so fucking premium!), but i'm not the majority there.
the key feature for me goes hand-in-hand with their walled-garden approach. that key feature is the phones lifespan. my iphone is literally as fast as the day I got it(1 yr ago). my friends android phones have all slowed down, despite having more ram and cpu-speed than my iphone. now if i was a richer man and could upgrade every 6 months, then alright. if i could deal with wiping it every 6 months.. then ok. but i cant. i'm used to a phone that doesn't need an anti virus(srsly). im used to a phone that just stays doing what it does without slowing down. It is for these last few reasons that I simply cannot (yet) have an android phone.

that makes you look mature. and really, I don't owe you a response past that because you're clearly just being an asshole for the kick of it. but since I am not 12, I'll just continue treating you as if you were trying to make a point and not being a bitch.


YOU are the one wrongly applying "current" standards here. Because while everything SO FAR has simply been replaced by the successor, we are now looking at something that evolves to become what the users want. Not everything can be incorporated into the protocol, but then again you completely ignored where I said "unless a new paradigm etc etc..." which allows for that scenario.
you keep missing my point about the fact that it is most popular for a reason, and that reason has more to do with software changes than being "first." It just so happened(as it does) that being first gave it the strength to be popular and match to the software changes required. 
but you don't care about that, and you won't think about it, and you'll probably just respond with "ugh" or some other insult.

Is agree with this post. As the most innovative altcoins have demonstrated, bitcoin is much more robust out-the-box than we expected. There won't be too many technical hurdles that bitcoin can't overcome that an altcoin(bitcoin copy) could.
There may be better political/social/methodological changes that bitcoin can't incorporate, but at that point you can't be thinking technically. You really have to ask "if I could, what feature could I program into bitcoin? What process is BETTER?"

Not really


I'm not sure you are actually considering what a pool IS and how hard it is to compromise it. The nodes do not download software from the pool. They will follow the rules of the actual software and any dissenting agents are quickly noticed. Delegates are NOT like mining pools, and they are controlled by decision rather than arbitrary math. 


no because of the previous paragraph


how should mining difficulty increase, then? should it... just... NOT increase?


don't be a racist, dude. if they want to put the work in, let them. if the goal is to have a bordered currency, i'm not interested. i want it to be global.


who is making this assumption? i think it is growing at a more rapid pace every single day, since its inception.


but the alt coin can't seem to grow anywhere close to bitcoin, so... then what? I mean... how are you setting the arbitrary time "deadline?" it will take as long as it takes, but it has NEVER happened before so we really have no baseline for how long it should take, right? 


... is not known to you, or anyone. sorry, but there literally isn't even an area of study with experts dedicated to this yet, because it has never  existed before.
With respect to the alt-coin: either improve the formula or get out. (obv this statement takes into account that I don't see DPOS as an improvement). The most different alt-coins I have seen from the current paradigm are things like ripple(which... fuck them, right?). if all you're telling me if "we can do in 2 mins what normally takes 10" then I just can't care. the 10-min heartbeat is perfectly fine to scale with to EXTREMELY large numbers, and I don't see it necessary to change it. I like the competing PoW system and I like that a block can be thrown out if the rest of the chain doesn't follow it. i think it creates an environment that fosters growth.
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:25:03
I don't like that you said "agency that invented the fundamental backbone of Bitcoin" as if it is more than math. It's not. That's why satoshi/agency is irrelevant. We see the code and we know the math. It will never be broken and there is no magic formula that will ever break it.
Also, there was a time Bitcoin was worthless and thought of only as a drug-purchasing vehicle. If any of what you said applied. I feel it would have died back then. Instead it soared and is now accepted by much larger entities and has much more development and value.

it all depends on what you believe will happen and the reasons you believe it. combined with how much you can risk to lose. 
It's a shitty situation to be in, i'll give you that.
For me, I understand the method and value of the encryption and blockchain process. I'm no economics major, but I completely see the massive faults in the current system and an ELATED(as a computer science guy) to see the nerds solving this one. It used to scare the shit out of me that the US-D will one day eat a big fat D. Now I welcome it with open arms.
So to put it into "should I buy" perspective: if you can afford to not have a certain amount of money in your bank account for the next few months, you HAVE to buy. Even if it's $100, if you won't open your wrists for losing it then I think it's the SMARTEST gamble you can take.
To speak to the trends: We have come very close to the previous peak. It has always come close, but not crossed. After it approached, it SPIKED. If this is to be a trend, then (again) you HAVE to buy. If this is not a trend(3 or 4 times isn't a strong sample), then... it's more of a gamble. 
If you can't eat without that extra twenner in your pocket, then don't touch bitcoin.
But if you have to decide between a bag of weed and bitcoin... be sober for a month and make an investment.

thats the current market cap... bitcoin has more tradeable units than the USD ever will. think about what causes stability/instability, and bitcoins future looks very stable.
if that's not enough, each "bubble" is less insane(percentage-wise) than the one before it. every time.

here's my problem with that: it requires believing in "shills." 
for example.. I think the buttcoin guys are fucking assholes, but i won't accuse them of being shills. I can't imagine that there are a) people out there hiring social-network-agents to deter bitcoin AND b) no one has released proof that they were approached. For all the same reasons, I don't think bitcoin has shills. Believers, sure. but not shills. It would completely cast my view of bitcoin into doubt if anyone had approached me to up/down it.
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:43:24
Dode, come on. Are these guys assholes? Sure. Are they ignorant? Ya very. Do they go out of their way to find things they don't like so they an circle-jerk with their fake online friends? Absolutely. 
But "paid?" i don't know about that. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 05:27:27
by which definition? my point is they're on the network and someone didn't use half-a-bil to hack a coffee. it works in seconds. when you use bitcoin online, does it take 10 mins or 30 seconds? it has always given me the "paid" status within a minute of sending, that CAN'T be because someone verified it that fast.

can we define some facets of a ponzi scheme vs an investment asset? i'm not sure how you're doing so. 
I think(change this if you like) that it "pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors." Note from this that the money isn't coming from "good performance" or "perceived value" or any sort of adoption. The money is coming from new(or repeat) investors.
Do you feel this is how bitcoin works? What about gold or USD? 
Bitcoin, like any other asset, does NOT pay out from new investors. an older investor is NEVER guaranteed larger returns(though... historically... it has been good) in a stock, in a currency, or in bitcoin. No one authority receives money or decides who to pay out to.

Can you better explain what you mean about the two years before the reward halving? Like, what it means to bitcoin and why the long time has an impact?


how so? not bait, I genuinely don't know.


Now you're trolling. 


For this to happen, we must first consider the faults of the current system and match them against our desire for decentralization. I don't consider this a tech issue(coz they'll figure it out once the idea arrives), I consider it a societal/economics issue. If another cryptocurrency can figure out how to be MORE useful than bitcoin while still being decentralized and have the adoption, then OF COURSE bitcoin will die. But what kinds of rules will that system entail? It can't just be a different heartbeat time or encryption. it has to be bigger, more fundamental than that. So name ONE thing you would LIKE bitcoin to do that it can't or won't do? If we can agree that it is a better(and more appealing to the crowd) feature that cannot be implemented into the bitcoin protocol, I will sell all my coins. I don't hate money, I want more of it, and I listen to reason. Show me a better option and i will JUMP SO FUCKING FAST.

no no no. you are considering the entirety of bitcoin being hacked vs the account of one bank. apples and oranges. 
if the entirety of bitcoin is hacked, then they have created a device which can guess a ton of passwords in a large-number space very quickly. to equate this, imagine they hack ALL banks and fund their own bank accounts with infinite dollars. the USD would be dead in the same way.
the only real way to compare this is: what is the likelihood of either one happening? one is mathematically much easier to do, so i'm guessing that's the one that will fall first.
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:31:30




I didn't mean to contradict myself. What I meant was it wasn't just "one" guy. That, and you can literally ask ANY guy. It doesn't even have to be a phd, it can be a BS in math as well. ANY ONE of them. or ALL of them. I cannot stress just how infallible math is. 


in any other science, yes. not in mathematics.


Never on a linear computing system. There is literally no formula for this, and never will be. Once quantum computing happens, then yeah maybe.
I am not saying "not up for debate" to shut down your side. I'm saying it is BY DEFINITION not up for debate. It's like saying that someday the square root of negative one MIGHT be a rational number someday maybe. just NO. 
we are not even dealing with primes, we're dealing with RELATIVE primes. seeded by bigass, totally ambiguous ellipses and shit. and then SHA256'd all over again. 
the real crux, though, is that if a system ever approaches this kind of power(again, probably not linear computing), that banks and small-number systems will fall many years before bitcoin. so while it's not impossible to simply subvert physics and near-magically quantum-guess a crazy amount of numbers, bitcoins idea of a currency system will hold water much longer than any previous system ever could.

 just to give you a glimpse of CC companies VS large retailers: apple couldn't take off a single percentage point. not even half.
I suspect you misunderstand visa VS amazon's roles here. you are considering amazon the gatekeeper to visa's customers. I consider their roles reversed. 
but this digression really brings us back to amazon and bitcoins: as you've stated, you have no clue. 0% is still going to beat amazon, no matter how well they negotiate. They haven't negotiated(coz why would you if you're visa?), so... it's pretty much about 2% to them. my point stands that its MILLIONS of dollars of potential money to amazon because a system with zero humans is CHEAPER than one requiring thousands.

Yeah maybe that's a smart way of putting it. I don't like to think of "backing" as a tangible "good," it's just that until the eUSD we have ALWAYS had tangible-backing. The current eUSD has "military" backing, and the USD before it had... well... gold. If "backing" can be "faith" (faith in the military and in our govt) then I don't see why Bitcoin can't have "security" and "utility" as backing.

we literally made an entire subreddit around it. it is the most relevant thing here. we are not "keeping" it relevant, we are but a tiny microcosm of the entire ecosystem. dont pretend like if we all disappeared that it would suddenly be irrelevant.


Sorry I didn't know you knew the future and no one else did. glad you're here to clear it up for us.


cool off yourself there, pal


don't tell some other subreddit what they NEED to be. thats exactly the mentality that creates buttcoin. that's the whole point of my comment, that these kids are crying about something they DONT LIKE but they subscribe to it to GET MORE OF WHAT THEY DONT LIKE.


Because it is better than its predecessor. and for that exact reason... bitcoin.


In which way? that the price keeps going up? We could discuss this if you'd like, but i am guessing you WOULDN'T like, as it doesn't fit in with your ideas.


Another buttoin mistake, they think that the currency belongs to this subreddit. The guys in the Ninja-Turtle subreddit dont MAKE ninja turtles. The gameofthrones subreddit isnt comprised of the fucking show writers. And is not comprised of people who act as the economy of bitcoin. we just discuss, and others(buttoin) decide to tune in JUST to hate on it. if i hated something, I just wouldn't partake in it. but like shitty little Tommy from elementary school... it's more fun for you to hate with your non-friends than to simply find something else you like.

Good science fiction has nothing to do with predictive ability. it's fiction. it's specifically for entertainment.


The goal of their writers is DIFFERENT than Krugmans was for the task. POPSci is TRYING to be right. They use a tiny grain of imagination to extrapolate into the future. krugman was not asked to make a prediction and then dress it up as entertainment. he was asked for entertainment and not any sort of prediction whatsoever. It's not comparable in my view.


Right, but krugmans goal had NOTHING to do with guessing right. you can't ask someone to write science fiction and then attack it for not being science fact. it's just bad logic.

because it's not a trick. it's the opposite. a trick would be to view it in NOT log scale to make it look BIGGER than it really is.

No. It is more likely that when(not if) the security scheme is broken, it'll be EVERYBODYS accounts being cleared out in 1 second by a computer program. Then we will see how well FDIC insurance works, won't we?
(note: if this happens and they DO cover everyone, even with "funny-money" that is more "numbers" than it is actual money, I will be truly impressed and happy)

I think "price" is a metric we have accidentally placed on Bitcoin without realizing that it doesn't need to be there. It really is only concerning when it is exchanged for goods/dollars(which is all the time), but i am hoping this is slowly removed from the system. We have seen it jump up due to bad news and eat shit due to good news. What it MIGHT be is that nobody has any idea what it's worth... so.. hopefully it's worth billions...
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:38:59


In sticking with the metaphor: The ship is being loaded up, pre-sail. And the "billions" is not full capacity.


How did that go? It's reaching limits. Humans can only consider SO MUCH ahead of time


100% disagree. I think that's the entire reason for it. Future consistency.


I don't see that, of course. I see it as adding consistency and reducing potential "loss" from smaller blocks that can't be changed once we have too many to fork.


I'm conflating block-limits and transaction-limits with the system being broken. But really, it's not broken, it's just slowing down compared to the speed we WANT.


Yeah, and I am worried that losing to Western Union will break bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:16:58


if that's the worst of it, let's have it NOW and not LATER. they become more tricky as time goes on. 


We should check, tho. If it can, it benefits the group.


Yeah, but it would be MORE unusable if they left it at alpha-stage and missed some big opportunities to become more "robust" in preparation for unforseen changes.


Yes. we need to make it as consistent as possible before we let it "run wild."


I suspect these stakeholders will prefer a brighter future over a brighter present. i HOPE so, anyways.


But we can see that it WILL break. Either fees will become too large or block sizes will become too small. While i too would PREFER market-economics, i believe it can only adjust the problem within a "range," and the REAL solution has to be stronger. Maybe 20MB is too large, or too small? If it's close, though, then the market can adjust within that range.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:52:19
remember when you asked me if bitcoin wasn't a ponzi just because of "semantics" and I explained to you that's how semantics work?

YES. This is your absolute last chance to do so before it leaves. It's not a great way to do things but I view it as LAST CHANCE.


We want organic growth, but NOT increasing the block-size might STIFLE it. 


Yes, but there won't BE any competition if we cannot raise this number. I don't want it to go away without even trying to compete.


Yes, but TPS directly factors INTO capacity. like in 2X=Y, X is not Y but it is a factor of Y.


Can we not use this example? humans on a highway are just not a good representation of entries in a ledger, or blocks to be mines.


WHAT thought, though? I mean, it's easy to say "probably thought of it" but WHAT was the solution he thought of, exactly? If Gavin Andresen can't see it, is it REALLY likely to be there?


In a tiny bubble. in a lab. not in the real world(which has transactions flying left and right like VISA might). You believe it is ready for prime-time, I believe it needs a bit more work. 


Yeah, so by this logic we should cease research on thorium and fusion and such? NO! Plow through! Get the very best and THEN we can relax!


And we need to know about this BEFORE we cost everybody their savings. The sooner we find this type of bug, the better.




Yep. fix it PRIOR to launch. not after, not during. PRIOR. Again, in our metaphors you believe we are "off and running" whereas I think we haven't left port yet. To me, "launch" happens sometime after Beta. Preferably v1.0.


Yes, and we need to know if it is(or is not) good. NOW is the time to check, as NOW is the only time we will be able to go back(if it sucks)


Who waits for 6? It has been shown that for most transactions 0 is fine.


Yes. And then we will fork to that chain. sounds good to you? sounds good to me.


It would have "emerged" in 1980 if they could only handle such a limited amount But they are centralized and could handle much more. We don't need to hit 1000TPS or anything, but i'd like more than 7 plz. 


Because it works. I want bitcoin to be that.




fee costs. if they can beat bitcoin, its value might be over-rated(i think they suck and they wont win, of course).

you're right that stupid people will simply not bother. but there is another class of "semi-stupid" people that WOULD read it if they cannot dismiss it through other "dumber" means. maybe "semi-ignorant" is the correct word? They are willing to LOOK at the few sentences and think "well, he isn't going to have a smart discussion in a few sentences" and leave. But these few people WOULD read it, if there was enough there to make it "look" smart. Oh! And don't forget the people who think longer=smarter and will therefore be more likely to believe it.
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:38:02
correct, and a transaction must be only one satoshi. the "600" is an arbitrary minimum that miners want to accept, they don't want dust transactions. if only there were a pre-set group of miners just for these tiny transactions... hmm...
so what if each device has less than a penny on it, and they all just trade these fractions to communicate. again, there doesn't have to be a verification process because there is no need to trust the transaction. iduno. just guessing.

Oh god, this hurts my heart.
If ANYTHING, log scale REDUCES the look of "growth." As other comments down the thread point out, it is required because making $10 on $10 is NOT the same as making $10 on $10,000. We can't consider it as the same "$10 price up victory" because that $10 means LESS when the price is high. That's why log scale is so important, it displays exponential growth as linear.
A "trick," would be to NOT use Log Scale, in order to make it look like MUCH MORE GROWTH than it really is.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:49:26
yeah, it's a strange dilemma because we WANT to reward it if it's real. But nobody checks post or account history...

@_date: 2015-01-08 21:26:50
totally. i'd be more impressed if they create a bot that can TELL whether a bet was executed or not. even the bitcoin-escrow protocols required a third human... only the number-readers can do it by automation.

Yeah, not from your pal. But when you have a business that has to automate many transactions and keep track of them all, you don't just have one wallet to check every morning. computers have to generate and store and reference the wallets to make sure the right money comes fromt he right people.

That's current accepted miner action, not a change to the protocol. "dust" transactions will be accepted (you can test this), and can be specifically accepted from known internally designated addresses.

Bitcoin exists on a "chain" of "blocks." A block just stores a bunch of transaction info. "Mining" each one verifies the transactions in it and creates the appropriate succession for the next one. But there must be a first... and this was the first.

No. Volatility decreases with depth and breadth. As long as the market value continues to rise and it makes its way into more users wallets, volatility will go down.

But they are not only smaller fees(and will likely continue to be so), but they don't place restrictions on when the receipt happens. Don't forget that it takes a while for a CC company to get to the equivalent of "one" confirmation and then an even longer while before that money is actually received. The delay is because they deal with Fraud and need time to reverse a transaction if necessary

@_date: 2015-08-05 22:04:51
But doesn't bitcoin solve very specific problems that these distributed databases don't? If you think the problem t0 is trying to solve is "data concurrency" and "distribution" then you are mis-understanding the point.
None of the ones listed there are an immutable ledger. THATs what is being solved. They have a thousand ways to distribute, but to verify and prove that there's no tampering? That's not a built in function of these systems.
A CassandraDB admin could edit anything inside it. "no, we didn't post that. your screenshot is photoshopped. our database doesn't have that record."

@_date: 2015-08-05 23:09:09




Depends on your definition of "decentralized." It's still multiple machines independently verifying each others work. It's not like the creator of a particular chain of blocks has some magic password to fake transactions, that requires HEAVY computation.


In this example, who is handing out permissions? Is it someone with the power to DELETE and UPDATE?
@_date: 2019-06-07 07:50:17
Why does it matter who made SHA256? Does that make it any less useful? We know the algorithm, and we know it checks out. It’s not like it’s a secret black-box function that we “presume” to be safe. It’s not THAT advanced a concept, any CS or math major can verify it really is secure. 
It’s just seems strange to attack the source of a great technology, we can still use it without requiring faith in the source it came from. Even if CSW was satoshi(kek), we wouldn’t stop using bitcoin, right?

Do not invoke the name of someone who is not working on the project to back up your point. If we don't wish for the media to use him as a negative("omg the creator is hidden, bitcoin is scary"), then we cannot use him as a positive either. He's just a guy. He's out. Henry Ford didn't build the modern car, just a predecessor.

No, but distributed networks are separate distributed networks.  So I ask again: What's the problem?

@_date: 2015-08-12 21:56:59
I know we see a lot of "drama" and armchair-developers here in r/bitcoin, but let's all take a second to note and appreciate that the top devs keep their shit EXTREMELY civil, even when strongly disagreeing with each other.
Remember a few weeks ago when "Mike H" disagreed with "Eric L?" 90% of the comments here were angry, unsubstantiated garbage, but everything back on the bitcoin-dev discussion was always very focused and courteous. They stuck to their guns, didn't call each other names, and backed everything they said up.

I understand you don't see other reasons, but please understand that this doesn't mean they don't exist. It means you just don't know them. It certainly doesn't mean that your best guess is FACT, and it also doesn't mean that I am some magic arbiter of Purse.io knowledge. I'm just calling bullshit where I see it and letting others pick up the pieces if they can.
Note that nowhere are you(or the other guy) saying "i believe that..." or "i think that..." or "it stands to reason that..."

That's fair, an "app" can't in ITSELF be analogous to a "blockchain." 
But if we view different blockchains as having different applications(and they DO, right?), then we can still ask: "WHY must one application/blockchain utilize another application/blockchain?"
Sure, if one has a particular use and it performs well for its use case, then it would be silly not to use it. But for most cases, especially those that specifically don't want outsiders to share in the internal info/process, a separate blockchain is the ONLY possible option, right? Or is it?

In reading about this crisis(on reddit...), I understood that everyone knew the "trick" including Greece. Imagine if banks were selling something called "Predatory Loans," wouldn't it be YOUR fault for purchasing one?
If I take both sides to be the culprits here, I am lost in thought forever. But like said, there isn't a single "country" that you can refer to as a "culprit." Both Greek and German(amongst others in the EZ) individuals made BANK from this deal knowing it would likely fuck everyone else over.

When I want "to clarify" and I ask a question, you call me a "fucking idiot." You can't just answer the question, you have to get shitty. Such a simple one, with major differences between both. This is probably because you have some preconceived notions and are just poor at going through a discussion. Likely due to stupidity, but I guess I don't know that for a fact.


When I asked "I thought it was resolved in favor of Purse and the client got their items, no?" you replied:


Sorry if I took the "nope" to mean a "nope," my bad. I must be a "fucking idiot," unlike you.


Again, you guess about me. enjoy that methodology, it will definitely serve you well in life. I'm eastern-European by birth, have relatives in Europe, and have been to many European countries multiple times. Good bet, though. Notice how you made a bet and I simply ASKED you? Another example, that's all that is.
So... Do you feel they handle things differently over there in Europe than over here in the US? Because I don't think that they do, especially when it comes to CC fraud or warrants and investigations. Can you be more specific? Or would you like to back-pedal, dodge the question, and insult me? I bet it's the second one...
Look, son. If you don't start holding up your end of the discussion, I'll have to just stop. You're being extremely shitty and unreasonable even under the lightest scrutiny. Either start speaking with something definitive, or just bail. I guarantee that if your next dumb-shit reply doesn't speak to your(and my) points, I'll just disable the inbox replies because this isn't getting us anywhere.
EDIT: Lol that's right. Downvote it. Just accept that your fucking bullshit doesn't hold up to a few easy clarification questions and downvote it. Don't explain, because you have shown you can't. Just downvote it.

I guess this is a half response to my question here 
I feel like you are avoiding it now by separating the blockchain into two rather than going into distributed hashed databases. Did you just make up the word "intrachain" for the purpose of the discussion? It's ok if you did, I like being able to separate ideas. Can you please elaborate on what the word means?
If you have left the "blockchain vs database" debate, may I ask what is a "permissioned blockchain" vs one that is not? Also I dont think "permissioned" is a word either, but I guess you mean that people have access to it?
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:06:05

So you didn't just back-pedal on a bunch of comments? I didn't just get you to finally pick a story by throwing your own "call it then forget it" logic back at you? Yeah, you're right. How DUMB am i? Downvote me again, that will show how smart you are


I'm just talking in general. not referring to any SPECIFIC incident.


Wait, so he DID get his shit back? I thought you said he didn't, earlier in the comments?


Was he raided or searched? One involves force and guns, the other involves a piece of paper. Just want to clarify.


Has this happened in the US? Because I imagine it would go in a similar way. Have you ever been to Europe?
So I understand it was an incident. Have the enforcement agents admitted it was a mistake? Did they investigate and then decide the process was OK, rather than illegal? Has this transpired again, anywhere? If so, was it a similar or different justification?
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:29:56


they're not using it as a public freebie coin. this is why it's important to understand bitcoin the CURRENCY vs bitcoin the TECHNOLOGY. This confusion is exactly why companies try to say "blockchain" instead of "bitcoin."


Please see where I said they could just fork it with a different seed. That's the solution to your "dev" issue. It's also what makes bitcoin powerful: that a 10-yr old can have the same wealth-storage power as a giant conglomerate.


Again, this is not the kind of thing they need to have sales or investments in. It's a tool for them, not an investment vehicle like for you.

No. Just stop guessing. The guy had a first-hand experience and posted it to reddit. You DIDN'T have ANY account, yet you felt it perfectly acceptable to speak from a position of knowledge and authority on the subject.
"Fair" is a silly concept your mom and your schoolteachers taught you. By saying things as FACT when they are GUESSES, you are deliberately misleading. This is bad, it has nothing to do with fair or not fair. Just use knowledge when you can, and don't pretend when you can't. WHY is that so difficult?

You can't think of any reason for savings except CC Fraud. That's fine. The problem I have is that you then use it as a factual argument as if you KNOW, rather than GUESS.

I'm chill with everything up to "Basically intranet blockchain is secured by force" The force of a password? Or the force of their few intranet computers? Because that's important. I completely disagree with everything that comes after "just to name a few keywords to give you an idea:" because I don't like people adding their own flavor to the system. I understand new concepts come up, but please leave the mindless ledger as a mindless ledger. Theyre all things that exist outside of bitcoin and anyone can use them. Also ASIC chip fabrication didn't "grow so fast," specialized chips have been around before Intel. Intel had to DE-Specialize them to gain feature at the sacrifice of power.
Why not just say "bitcoin uses a blockchain" and "bank X will use their own blockchain?"
It doesn't HAVE to be different, but why not just fork bitcoin with a different seed? They can use it for their OWN purposes, they dont have to make it public, their own machines verify things. If it's a block based on the hash of the previous block plus new data to keep continuity in a chain, it's a blockchain. If Apple made a car we wouldn't call it the iPhone4Wheel, we would call it a car.
They don't owe us SHIT. they can use whatever chain they want and make whatever rules for it. it's their network, it's their ledger, let them have it.

He means RELATIVELY. Like, i could fall from 5000ft and live. Statistically its an impossibility, but it IS possible(google it).
When he says bitcoin is "mathematically impossible" to shut down, he means that no one YET has created an easy way to find public keys. It's POSSIBLE to just blast a random string into it and come upon a giant bitcoin wallet. it's POSSIBLE. It's also possible to break the math that governs the blockchain and simply create millions of coins or transfer funds. while it's POSSIBLE, it's MATHEMATICALLY impossible. Not IMPOSSIBLE, just so highly improbable that it's nuts to even consider it a possibility(until quantum computers, which could ruin everything).
I suppose it is POSSIBLE to shut down all our computers with some massive country-wide EMP(solar flare, whatever) and suddenly be the largest peers on the network. But is it gonna happen? 
Public keys arent impossible to break, but they use them for all kinds of high-value transactions simply because by the time you DO break one, the message has been sent and received a WHILE ago. Bitcoin hinges on the stipulation that our combined computing power greatly outweighs any one controlling body. It's not impossible to outweigh us, but it's so difficult and so unlikely that the words "mathematical impossibility" apply.
Roger is no dummy. He has the message DOWN PAT(call his shit patricia). if more bitcoin users were able to repeat it in simple sound bytes, the currency would be larger today. 
TLDR: its harder to fake than coins or bills...

possible scenarios:
1) government/banks realize BTC exists, and attempt to shut it down. in this case, i see this as a giant boon for bitcoin(Streisand Effect).
2) government/banks DONT realize BTC exists. they die, we win forever.
3) a much larger company(IBM, Intel, microSoft) copies the idea, and markets it WAY better than bitcoin. bitcoin dies.
To me, the most likely scenario is the 3rd one(the bad one). if this happens, it comes down to whether a new "owned" currency can catch on VS bitcoin which has no owner. i, for one, will always avoid an "owned" currency(i didnt think like this back when i was a kid and began earning my money in awful, awful USD). I am 100% for bitcoin and hope it wins.

i'm not even sure people want freedom that badly. most people i try and "push" bitcoin on go CRAZY over the fact that it's not government controlled. no, seriously. 
as long as google(or the like) can market it well(lower transaction fees than any credit card/bank/western union etc), it can kill bitcoin.
bitcoin is so viral though. anyone who invests in it BOASTS it. it forces people to really reconsider the concept of money and value. overall it's good for our world even if it IS beaten by something similar.

hes pretty much saying "it cant be anything else." speculation is the only one left. id say its like 90% speculation. 
its all "in our heads" but that isnt to say economics dont drive it at all. as greece eats economic dirt, its citizens look for more steady alternatives that aren't quite susceptible to greed.
most true bitcoin "future-ers" (speculators) believe the other currencies will fail out(the suspected flaw is they are owned and controlled by a governing body) and we will be left with only one already-started currency that doesn't have this flaw.

Yes, but that doesn't mean that they ALWAYS demand non-existent things.


How about speaking for yourself? I don't need prescription meds, but that doesn't mean NO ONE needs them. 


My previous point


Give it time. Proving a files existence (beyond doubt) has REAL VALUE and REAL USE in the REAL WORLD. Is that something you are denying?
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:37:53


No. I want to do it for free. Which is doable today. I was not referencing Factom. Factom just makes the process easier for people. I was answering your question. Here, let me paste it for you to make it easy :)
**In any case, who needs decentralized proof-of-existence? Please enlighten me; where is the demand for this?**


You're right, fuck our entire patent and copyright system, nobody ever wants to prove anything they invent, right? I mean it's not like there have been a bunch of music-copyright lawsuits recently. Not like apple and samsung ever argue about who can use what feature based on who had it first, so why even bother with the blockchain? Let's get rid of it! Also free snacks for EVERYONE!
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:05:23


Just answering your question. Why is that confusing to you? Did you even read what I wrote? I don't need to paste it again, do I? Here:
**In any case, who needs decentralized proof-of-existence? Please enlighten me; where is the demand for this?**


Ever heard of a tax accountant? They just make the process cost money for people, ya?


That serves a purpose for a very very expensive price.


The service is the blockchain. Free. Having a file hash stored there can be legally used in a US court. Factom just does it FOR you, for a price. If you want. I personally don't.


It's more like comparing the Model T to a Tesla S. They both serve the same function. They both have speed, price, etc. One of the is faster and more efficient.

@_date: 2015-04-01 18:53:45

Of course Bitcoin is under attack. To think otherwise is to either misunderstand Bitcoin or misunderstand people who benefit from the dollar. 
I don't care. Let them attack. I'm not interested in a system that can be taken down by attack. The only way I will know if ths system can be taken down is if it is always under attack from the nastiest players in the biz.

You didn't ask me anything about factom. you asked me about storing hashes in a distributed system. Do you think I'm someone else? It is likely you think I am someone else, and that's why:
a) you keep doing this factom stuff and
b) why you can't back up anything you say - because it's not in this thread.

right, but i can also trigger a motor movement with like two calls. 
strange as it sounds, there are other things for the 21-inc machine to do besides move money. just like the tinyG board controls a shit ton of variables so i can focus on my app, this might end up serving a similar purpose. in the end, bitcoin can only go so far and eventually another layer will be required to extend it into new space. I don't see why the 21 machine CANT be that layer, but i guess we won't know until we see it.

It is important to separate out the political aspect from Bitcoin. The current pseudo-anonymity is not there because Satoshi had a political ideal. It is there as a by-product of the simple system itself. Now, privacy and anonymity COULD somehow be built into a "coin" or "blockchain" but I think it would be best to keep Bitcoin, the CORE of it all, politics-free. 
Now, if a necessary code change just *happened* to create more anonymity, then great. But I don't want bitcoin devs wondering about the political ramifications of their choices. I only want the best, most powerful technology... and I can only hope it gives me privacy.

@_date: 2015-04-01 18:28:10
I think the decentralization goal (when it comes to proving a document in time) is that you can't just convince a bunch of people to pretend like they received it earlier.
the trick would work like this:
-create doc
-hash doc
-give hash to pals
-pals place it i whatever databases(blogs, email, whatever) under an earlier date
in a decentralized environment, people can't control the date. that's why it's better
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:37:49
actually, they will mine over $100 per hour within their first two years. you see, they all act as a singular hash-distributor that can prevent two individual nodes from going through the same section of the elliptical curve, and so they can go through the hashing process faster than just a mining pool.
See how fun it is to randomly guess at shit we don't know? Like we can see some crazy acid version of the future, and then just say it as if it were fact? super fun.

@_date: 2015-04-24 21:12:17
tough to explain, but let me try: you know how when you first realized that bitcoin was super open, programmable, and untouchable by the feds? how the "possibilities" of the future uses suddenly seemed much more open? 
that's the moment i'm talking about. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 17:21:12
I think you have a pretty good indication of the sun rise from seeing it rise every single day without fail. Also, if it doesn't rise, we will all be fucked long before we know it.
But back to the issue at hand. These three questions will determine how much guess-work is being done: 
1) how many coins will the device mine per day? 
2) How much does it cost to "pay for an ad?" 
3) What does it even mean to "pay for an ad" when 99% of us skip over them?
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:35:38
why not? wouldn't a few satoshis literally be the barrier to entry?
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:32:52
I disagree with your first point. As a programmer, I will always take a good abstraction layer over my own think-of-it-as-i-go code.
Here's an example: Any fool can apply voltage to a motor. Some fools can trigger a computer to do it. Smarter fools will even program all the timing correctly. The smartest fools will perfectly track all the position and resistance variables. Instead of all that, I bought a TinyG so i could tell it "GO TO X,Y" and it will do it. Or if i wanted to have it draw out complex curves and shapes, i could do it without breaking open my trigonometry book.
I feel like that use case makes a ton of sense to everybody. From that, I can go on to say that while there are plenty of smart programmers out there, not all of them want to deal with the hassle of learning a new system when a little computer will do it for them. Some of them have ideas they want to get going and don't feel like re-doing all the leg work that can go into it.

is that a penny?
I don't think the same mining rules apply with devices like this. I suspect they will be looking at way more transactions in their early full-node setups, and many more cheaper ones. 
Don't forget, the goal of this device is communication. They can see and verify a transaction without it ever being confirmed by multiple parties. this is not to transfer a cup of coffee where such fee rules might come into play.
@_date: 2015-09-24 17:44:36


Cool, glad this finally showed up. I dont think this is an accurate comparison. Of course I see how it is compared on paper, but I just dont think it will be a comparison for what this device is meant to do. If it's just there to make a user passive money, we can probably guess a failure already.

the question you should ask is "what other applications does a blockchain have besides paying for stuff?"
We have seen a shit ton of application use cases, but they are always inexorably linked with the issue of verifying and that miners wont do so without being paid to do so.
Think of this as solving that chicken-egg problem by creating an infrastructure that an IoT setup can use without a hacker being able to come in and order 10 new engines for your car on your dime. "Things" certainly don't need money. They need communication. A "Thing" might need to broadcast a message to other "things" and need a secure medium to do it in? 
Communication is NOT "Paying for Stuff." It's sending a message. It could be a semaphore for all i care.

question (i dont know, not speaking from authority)
Isn't the actual plan of the FED and US Treasury/Bank almost literally as you said to hyper-inflate "any day now?"
Isn't the plan to continue to de-value forever? If not, good. Why not? If so, at what point can we add the word "hyper" to the inflation without sounding like whiny bitcoiners?

Like anything preloaded, the creator has access to your money.


Isn't the goal to make it necessary? Imagine when fridges and mcirowaves and cars and ipads have these fuckers, maybe there will be many more transactions to view and verify from a shit ton of devices, perhaps with higher distribution and lower fees?
ok maybe not ipads.
@_date: 2015-09-24 23:46:14


I suppose. Might depend on how they get the chip and whether it can be verified. A test user might be able to have the devices re-create a bazillion key pairs to notice a statistical grouping.

I cannot express enough times (as I have already done so) that they are just a "paid" version of a "free" service. you didn't ask about fucking factom(who i dont know). You asked if such a service has any use and I gave you an easy one which you claimed was far-fetched. Is that all you fucking have? The SECOND you realized it wasn't far-fetched for someone to want to protect their work, you jumped right back to factom. Stop trying to make factom happen, it's not going to happen. 
What an asshole.

No, this is NOT true of a "permissioned" blockchain. It is absolutely NOT a database with a logging mechanism. Please tell me how someone would go about making a change in the data of the blockchain? 
As long as the main hash method remains the same then everyone can notice an illegitimate block. The developer would have to get each of the individual entities to switch code, the decision to do so would still be on them. It would at least create a big warning that a change is coming, someone couldn't secretly go in and change stuff.

wait... how does passive monitoring work? just detective work afterwards? because now i see we have a major disconnect in our definitions. 
when they passively monitor, i think it HAS to be done in real time, and stored for review NOT in real time. i mean how could you possibly build a delay into servers and routers? you couldn't. (and why would you?)
Now you see the difference in our definitions and perhaps why you think they are actively monitoring everyone by your definition but not by mine.

they need to know that force will have to be applied to enforce unjust laws. they cannot think that simply telling the people what to do will work. it has to look expensive.

(i wont go into whether it's fucked up or not, separate discussion)
Actually, they do not monitor this stuff. They record/save it and datamine it later when the need arises. It doesn't make me feel any better, but you can go ahead and do/say whatever you want unencrypted as long as you are not one of their targets. But once you're a target/suspect, they'll go back and find fuckin EEEVERYTHING. Only then do they decide whether to monitor you or not.

@_date: 2015-11-09 20:34:55
the miners take the set of transactions, and start trying to "hash" them all a bunch of times until they come up with a hash that's low enough (starts with 0000\_\_\_). As mining becomes more difficult, the hash needs to be lower (starts with 00000\_\_). It's rare to find a hash, so when you announce it to the rest of the network, they can all verify it very quickly. if it's legit, it gets included in their own personal blockchain file. Everyone keeps their own blockchain file, and the "hash lottery" system keeps everything together and updated and in sync. When you are checking that "source" you are really only checking your own log(blockchain). because of the math, you can be pretty sure that everyone has the same chain.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:00:13
that's nuts. that's like saying money is draining out of the USD because banks have to pay employees.
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:16:58
I disagree about the 51% attack, since I think it'll be more likely that people will not only outweigh the "corporate" hashing power, but that an entity would be "blocked" immediately once they were caught changing the rules.
I also disagree about the block chain size as space becomes more plentiful and tree growth becomes smaller (not just by pruning, which is awesome, but also by changing the fundamental way the blocks are stored)
The transaction rate is a potential issue to me, but it is more likely to either be solved within bitcoin or by the side-chains that will work upon bitcoin. 
Thus far, I think it is possible to tweak bitcoin rather than force a switch, so I still think of it as "likely dominant in the future." But I have my own idea as to what other items can be addressed: Politics. Right now, some people prefer more anonymity and some prefer less. Some don't like distributed mining, some prefer it. Some hate our government, some need it. 
I think if bitcoin is to be replaced, it will be on the basis of politics. Just as it is happening to the USD, someone will invent a coin that works fundamentally differently and people will suddenly go "aha" at features they never knew could exist. Maybe people prefer a socialist society where coins must be give to help your fellow man instead of buying goods? Just a crazy example.

And that may end up being the goal. Are we sure the chip is strictly for the initial mining and nothing else?
I dont recall if it was them or some reddit user that suggested "pre-loading" might affect the security of the device whereas the ability to generate its own key after purchase and still get coins to it without added user input might be an interesting concept.
Let me ask you: why do YOU think they went for it this way? To get on the bitcoin-fool-buys-anything bandwagon?

what is the difference between actively monitoring and passively monitoring? 
Tell me if this is accurate to you:
Active - someone is listening. If you say "Go on white house" they'll be ready and actively waiting for you.
Passive - it is all being saved and stored. if you say "Go on white house" they'll never know you are coming. they would have to go back and listen through the calls in their database.

you cannot stop the main attack, but that doesn't mean you can't learn from it. they use the collected data to learn and go after anyone that is associated with a terrorist(successful or not).

Three reasons why.
The first is that ALL your points hold true when btc is worth 0.01$. And yet just 6 years later the trend continues. Live and learn, right?
The second is that all my education in comp-sci makes this a clear cut answer. It was obvious to me when btc was worth $5 and it's obvious now. If you have a CS degree and disagree, please let me know because I'm dying to hear your reasoning.
The third reason is that any singular notion has a certain percentage of detractors based upon its popularity. Notice how you HATE Bitcoin but you visit the forums? There was zero if you when this all started. You take the time out to find Bitcoin posts, even though you are against Bitcoin. It's almost as if you're worried about it succeeding. I've been noticing more and more of you that "hate" Bitcoin yet feel the need to keep trolling and keep posting. Based on yoU and the rest, I'd say everything is working out just dandy

Key concepts?
To reddit:
I view reddit as a tool. With the exception of the past few months, the tool has evolved to serve the purpose of moving the best posts to the top. But now some other group of people think they might be able to use it more as a discussion/forum than a news aggregator. Is this the intended use of the tool? Only tangentially. But is it really against some reddit key concept to moderate such a forum? I'm not so sure.
To Bitcoin:
I prefer not to make it political. Rocks dont have emotions, and bitcoin doesn't care about freedom. The "freedom" and "free market" are design aspects to help success, but I don't think they are core concepts of bitcoin. Bitcoin certainly represents these concepts to people, but then again hurricanes represent "god" to some.
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:01:29


I strongly disagree. business coalitions exist in this manner. joining the club(coalition) is difficult, and the incentive is knowing that other members are vetted and will be kicked out if they are bad. the incentive is that the other members KNOW if you are a member or not, and it brings reliable business their way.
I'm extremely surprised that people in this sub think a small group of extremely wealthy individuals can't have ANY other incentive to run a blockchain except "block rewards." Sometimes, just being in the club and running a lucrative business is worth more than "10btc."
Of course as bitcoiners who are looking towards a global currency, such a system is nuts. but to business owners who might not need to compete for BTC, there are other uses.
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:08:15
I'm not sure if we should be building politics into bitcoin... it's already polarizing as it is.
I understand many flock to it because of anonymity, but it's purpose is not that. it's purpose is "easy, cheap transactions" and the "pseudo-anonymity" was just a fun by-product.

@_date: 2015-02-23 23:01:27
that's not why. even the fact that you THINK this is why shows your horribly misguided view of this subreddit's subscribers.
it has nothing to do with 'fact' or not. it has to do with the fact that you're being a troll. your GOAL was to be an asshole, and then hide behind "just pointing out facts." There are many ways to point out facts, and many places that would LOVE your facts. They would especially love that your goal is to be an asshole, as they too enjoy this type of bullshit. 
sometimes you just can't blame others for not wanting to hear your shit. it is up to you to either pour some sugar on it or find some flies.

Not the guy you asked, but answering to hopefully add perspective: yes
I've already done so well with btc that I owe it to my pals to take ridicule from them if it fails. I think that's a silly notion at this point, but since you took the time to visit a thread you don't like I thought I would give you the answer you came for. Yes.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:48:20
Keeping the other parties honest. Lets say my pals and I wanted to have our own chain to track WHATEVER data we must track. My mining won't get me "tokens," but it might a) make sure no one else is cheating on the chain or b) help everyone on the chain achieve whatever it's meant to.
Let's say it's for a few big-time-banks to keep a log of loans/transfers between each other?
That's very "general" because I really have no idea. I'm just saying there can totally be an incentive that is not simply more tokens for the chain.

I don't know how to feel about the guys using "BIT_C-oin" and such. 
I mean I get the joke, but it's somewhat equivalent to calling someone a "poopy head."
Like the people who say "lib-tard" and "Barack Osama," it's super lame but... is it bannable? 
And what if someone makes an honest mistake and says "bit-coin" out of lack of knowledge?
I also think we can begin to differentiate between troll posts and dissenting opinions. Your typical troll post DOES contain a dissenting opinion most of the time, but certain other factors might give them away. For example, they simply post a similar(or exact) post on multiple comments and posts without reading any responses. Even if someone does try to reason and and create a dialogue, they're either shat-upon or ignored by trolls. Their goal is not to ask questions, but to be assholes. 
Recently, some guy was in a thread simply throwing out FUD to multiple comments. Stuff like "wasn't VanityGen a scam?" There was no research, no response, and now that's just left up there despite it being wrong... as if a logical, thinking user had read it somewhere.
Some people's comment history shows that they are just assholes looking for stuff they don't like. Definitely fuck those guys.

the guys who don't like bitcoin use funky ways of spelling it, mostly to create confusion and point out that we have little consensus.

Humans who eat, sleep, and take time to be educated.


Who are the competitors, here? What is their goal? I'm not sure i fully understand.


The banks were an example. Also, to say banks don't want an immutable ledger is lunacy. If I may ask, when was the last time you had a high-ranking position at a bank?


The answer is: you have no fucking clue. Stop it with stating random guesses as fact. They're guesses, created as responses to a hypothetical situation. Calm down.


WHAT PROFIT? Where and when did profit come into it?


Which is a situation you made up, again, in response to a situation i made up


Remember when I mentioned the design of such a chain? Perhaps have diminishing returns? Again, stop thinking block=reward. there are other reasons to be verifying a chain. Fuck what citibank can or cannot do, if they allow someone onto a private blockchain, you can bet there will be a fucking reason.


Are you responding to yourself? Can you respond to ME instead?


Yeah, probably not. But then again, you're one of the biggest banks in the world, and I'm just speculating. I mean it's not like these guys have billions of dollars to check with their IT teams before they begin throwing that shit into slides and presentations. YOU. You're the one that knows the answers. They don't, they're just billion-dollar corporations that make completely random leaps on a whim.

i have to disagree with bitcoins value as you have described it. the value is the immutable store of data. With currency, it is best if many people verify(mine) it because they have incentive to keep the system fool-proof. With their own private internal data, the incentive is only to keep everyone honest.

Thanks, but you literally have not only shown bias, but also a horrible mis-understanding of how AND how well bitpay works. All in the VERY first line. Why the hell would anyone even bother reading past this? I asked for some clarification and you completely missed the entire question, opting instead to add non-factual crud which doesn't even attempt t broach the topic. a simple "i dont know" would have sufficed. I almost regret even treating you like a thinking human being.


WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS GARBAGE FROM? How can I even respond to this type of preconceived nonsense? Anonymity is not something bitcoin stands for. It doesn't really stand for jack-shit, it just IS. 


I suppose the same reason they use bitcoin for other stuff? probably security and ease-of-use. Maybe they do it for other reasons, i'm just guessing based on my own.


You don't pay fees for your card? Which one do you have? I don't think I have seen a credit card that doesn't charge a fee, but i'm willing to switch from Capital One.


Yes, all at the expense of fees. Some people don't need their "protection" and would prefer to do things without being charged extra.

I don't know if that's the key question. nobody is offering it to the trolls. they dont want it, and we don't want them. they can move on and not be exposed to bitcoin for years(i think). 
So maybe the key question is: "Why take the time and energy to hate it when you can never see it again?"
I don't like MLM schemes, but you don't see me hanging out in (just guessing) or (also guessing)

Let's say it's this, if this is all it is. it reasons that not everyone wants these costs passed onto them. I'm really putting the argument to the previous guy(who prob won't be comin back), but it makes sense that not everyone wants shit to be more expensive for their "own protection." Some people feel like they can protect themselves and shouldn't be "charged for protection" like a mafia setup.

Right, i did say this, but why does that make bitcoins failure a silly notion? How does one impact the other?

But I don't think you are responding to "why is bitcoins failure a silly notion" and I definitely don't think my cavalier attitude about it makes its failure a silly notion. That would be absurd, right?

The USD fails this test with a few examples, especially when it comes to the laws made by the people who also control money. lets say drugs and stuff, for example. But since nobody could prevent a bitcoin transaction(cough malleability cough) I think I trust it more.


If this is what trust is, then bitcoin has less trust. Improving all the time though!

This is solvable by the most trivial of parameters, all of which are fully implemented and functionally applicable.


But this is extremely small-time thinking. It's children playing. Of course all you have to do is make the timeline tougher. You're thinking of ways that the current system is used to track this kind of stuff. Bitcoin mixers are just too powerful for this, only relying on the end-user for a fuckup. 
If those are your two strongest points, then either you don't understand mixers or you pretty much admit they work fine as long as their users don't make it obvious.

A secure ledger that requires no trust to ensure other parties can't modify it outside the given rules. There are many applications for this, but financial currency seems to be the easiest and most obvious. It's an unbreakable system, that's an extremely big deal to CS guys in general, but also expands heavily into many industries. It's SUCH an easy decision to buy, and the outcome seems inevitable unless the US can quickly compete with it(USCoin?)


What trend is the first poster detailing? Bitcoin wasn't worth anything to institutions at $0.01, there was no way it could gain any traction at $0.01, it will never be money at $0.01. Nobody will ever use it, and nobody will ever accept it. Then came $0.02 for some reason, then magically $1, then $10, then newegg, overstock, microsoft, all AFTER it was worth $0.01.If it had value to people at $0.01, it will certainly have value at $250.




Ok, you can simply state an opposite point, but i disagree. Think about it. These kids get up in the morning and browse all day in hopes of saying something negative. I checked their user history, some of them do it 8hrs a day. if i believed in anti-bitcoin shills I would suspect they're doing it as a day job. Some even make new accounts for posting and for upvoting, that's some  work put in. I've only ever made one of these reddit accounts ONCE! They FIND things they dislike. ON PURPOSE, are you understanding? They don't just hang out in the buttoin sub all day, that would get stale.


Me neither.

dude i knew NONE of this stuff until bitcoin. I always heard "fiat" and never once thought to check out what it means.
more or less "fiat" is "faith" based, meaning the Govt mandates that it IS money and it DOES have value and since we all WANT a money system(i can't imagine who doesn't), it works out great. Mostly.
Gold is not fiat because it takes work to mine(or money to buy from someone), and bitcoin is not fiat for the same reason. I think the computer-cycles alone(albeit millions at a clip) give it value. some jackass can't just ADD a million bitcoins to the database like they do with the USD.

i bought in at 5.7(lucky, i know) and i had the same mindset. "this money is gambled and lost." when it was down in the $3 and $4 area, it still hurt. i wanted to sell. but i held onto my "gambled and lost" and it finally began to pay off.  
the truth is, i DO expect some kind of price "correction" to happen. but at this point, i'm secure enough in it that I KNOW it will continue to go higher. maybe it'll take a while, but it will be a win.

i believe he has read through it. and he is right, that while the guy(author) is ON OUR SIDE, he has a serious misunderstanding of the bitcoin protocol. Once the concept of "unstoppable tech" truly hits him, he(author) will change his mind(and be a happy, happy guy). this is not a "us vs them" thing. it's a church arguing for a flat-earth. no matter how they fight it, the truth WILL come out.
much like the concept of "infinity," the nature of bitcoin is too much of a mind-fuck for some people, especially those who have been training themselves to think in terms of human-to-human lawmaking. computer-science degrees see the writing on the walls. 
his argument that society will place "know your customer" responsibilities on bitcoin dealers is not correct, simply because he STILL THINKS this is the kind of thing that can be done.
As a consumer(and a patriot that loves his country, despite its awful flaws), i dont WANT to be known. i dont WANT sellers to get-at-me. I want to buy a product(maybe not guns or bombs), and i dont want to be on a list for it.
people who work in money-transmission studies often buy into concepts like "pre-crimes." Things like drunk-driving, money-laundering, etc. are NOT crimes. They simply SOMETIMES facilitate crimes. I dont want to legislate risky behavior. money-transmitter-ologists(new word) do.

@_date: 2013-06-11 18:11:30
your price points are realistic. 
i think you're exactly right about adoption, and i have this: every idiot uses credit cards(some would argue even DUMBER people, actually). None of them understand the internet or encryprion or account numbers.
By your own argument, all they have to do is make BTC easily usable(hardware wallet) to the average joe, and it's done. I believe this will be much sooner than anyone thinks.
Also, what is the critical mass of simple math and numbers with nothing but a geeks belief in their security to back them? I think it's pennies. And if its not pennies, it's quarters. And if it isnt quarters, it's dollars. And if not that, $100 should certainly convince you(the crash after $31 had me convinced)
I think BTC is binary - either it becomes standard de-facto, or it fails out completely. This boring "$100" mumbo-jumbo is just a side-effect of having to start somewhere. I think $5000 is low :D

they are adding large amounts of scrutiny ON TOP of it. sure, large exchanges are extremely noticeable and therefore must be good in the eyes of the regulators. but I could send you $20k worth of BTC without anyone knowing who, what, or where. 
there is nothing that can be done to stop an exchange like that. No law, no technology. Maybe if they started long ago and have some trick math going, they could eventually trace it back to mtgox's green addresses. that's it.
edit: also dont forget - any problem EVER(i stress EVER) for these exchanges has been with fiat, which continues to eat more shit year after year. there will come a time when fiat isnt quite so in-demand, and trading for it wont be as interesting.

technically, every single bit-penny can be traced back to its inception. this includes every single wallet it passes through, even if there are 5000 transactions per second between three randomized "mix" wallets. 
The only thing they cant trace is who each wallet belongs to. but if for example they see one wallet address(in the chain) they know(like a bank or mtgox), they could go to them and be like "wth, who is this guy?" and they BETTER be keeping records. IRS are the ultimate mafia.

good answer.
ver told me about it in vegas, right before the spike. i was jealous when the $30 mark hit shortly thereafter, and then took the $5 price point as a buy-in opportunity.
to whoever stood by bitcoin - they deserve the rewards. i know a few others who took that time to buy in, and while things have been a bit shaky, i've gained a ridiculous amount of confidence in it.
i've never bought into anything before and having my first investment be a success and so heavily focused in the computer world(where i reside) is just badass.

ok so the "chain" is like everyone building on the previous answer. every time a new "answer" appears, it gets added onto the chain. so in this case, one client allowed for a different block size and found a different answer. normally, this gets rejected, but since it wasn't technically an "incorrect" answer(good ol bitcoin!), people with the newer client began to accept it. and so two acceptable answers were found and are being built upon. this is bad. this makes everyone have different answers. everyone should be in agreement. so now they are just going to reject the newer answer and encourage everyone to build on the previous, smaller one.

same way other money works. a dollar is ONLY worth what others are willing to pay for it. their value is established because some chinese factory goes "ok, i'll put together some toys for you, and you give me X dollars."
in bitcoin, half the network might decide "oh shit the old math sucks." They will begin using slightly different rules(this wont happen, dont worry) and eventually two "chains" will be established. most people will trust one of the chains(of rules) and not accept money from the other chain. (people in italy decided the Lira was crap and went with the Euro. but some people will still trade a ton of Lira for a Euro).
in the end, this is all moot because the rules are so obviously working that any change will be miniscule and widely accepted. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 20:40:38
at 1Tril (current US) it would be around 80k-90k. But i personally don't think it will be limited by borders.

could one find a "target" address and find out the entire chain of coins after they were sent from the target address? also what happens in circular movement, where multiple people keep redistributing coins amongst themselves? would it make it any less trivial to find the entire path(no matter how convoluted) of spending?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:17:34
i mean when it hit $10, my friends said "its too high, i cant buy in when it was only $1 before." same for $50, $100, all the way through $1000. only those who bought in despite their "im late" fears have profited. i think the party will carry well through 5-digits, and possibly through 6-digits. $1000 is STUPID CHEAP when you think of the potential earnings.

you can cry "price" all you like. i'm in it for the long haul and i do believe that it will work BECAUSE it is built to respond so well to market forces.
also, don't be a dick. my point was that it IS a wildly unchecked system(except for where it counts, which is security). you didn't have to bring price into it. you think $10/hr is a crazy jump for bitcoin? i've been in it(to win it!) for maybe like 2 yrs now, never bailing like the speculators. don't tell ME $88, jerk. if it didnt die after crashing from $31 to $4 with WAAAY LESS ADOPTION than it has now, you think going from $99 to $90 is gonna kill it?
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:16:57
problem 1: no one has BTC yet
problem 2: you wish to support BTC while using GBP(i think)
simple way to solve two problems: put a big sign on the window that says "NEW! GBP Now accepted here!" so when people come in and ask "why would you put a sign up? what ELSE would you use?" you can be like "well, bitcoin of course. the one true international currency? evr hurrd of it?"

first off, don't mine. you're welcome for that advice.
second off, mining is a lottery. your "hash rate" is how many guesses at the lottery numbers you make. now, there are pools of TONS of people with TONS of mining equipment making TONS of guesses. 
if YOU hit a number, you get 25btc. fuck them.
if ANY of them hit, they split the 25 amongst their pool. fuck you.
so either get really lucky, build a gigantic pool, or join BTCGuild mining pool. at least that way your GPU cycles will generate a TINY fraction of a bitcoin. not more bitcoins than the electricity costs to run those GPU units, but still.

I agree with just buy&amp;hold. straight up, though: be ready to gamble. look at your money and expect a loss. the odds are against us all. 
having said that, i am REALLY happy i invested when I did($5.1USD), i LOVE waking up in the morning and seeing the future happen right before my eyes, and im happy I havent sold out(i had sells for like 100 @ $15 and cancelled them JUST before it hit). i dont need the cash, and i'm proud to be contributing to what I hope is the future of our world's economy. lots of people TALK about helping the world, I threw cash in :)

moving BTC is typically easy. Your destination exchange will give you a "receiving" address, and your source(maybe coinbase) has a "withdraw" option, which asks for a bitcoin address to withdraw to.

ive always said that the only thing that can kill it at this point is Fiscal Responsibility. People LIKE the USD. they do.

2) its exciting! that's why she's eating popcorn, while watching intently! Also, to go deeper, this is from (i think) "Scary Movie," a scene in which the girl from "the ring" is coming to kill this popcorn-eater, but she's so enthralled and excited by the scary-ness that she just sits there eating popcorn! even though this is her life at stake!

so far all this is sound, but i disagree with your point about newcomers. any(literally any. without disagreement. google it.) graph of exchange, or use, or adoption, or market penetration shows continued growth. of course, if everyone gives up on it(this is possible. some negative press could scare enough people into selling/falling prices), then its dead. but i think itll more likely continue along the path, and as it does so, it will REALLY fuck shit up for the "established" currencies... which will only drive more people to BTC.
i agree that the earliest adopters stand to become "bitcoin millionaires" but that money WILL eventually distribute. i have much more faith in the wisdom of crowds than i do small groups of "decision-makers."
also about the "price factors:" the dollar has the supply/demand factors AND the instability of number. i'm just choosing a better option...

think about it from the other side... do you REALLY want money supply to be flexible? haven't we lost enough value just flexibly printing off dolla-dolla-bills-yall? i think the inflexibility in PRODUCTION but infinite flexibility in USE is the true power of bitcoin.

math checks out.
@_date: 2013-03-15 06:03:04
fiat ("faith") is when they TELL us to believe in the money. generating bitcoins requires work. therefore it's not fiat. 
to make more bitcoins, one must work harder. not just... add a zero... bernanke im looking at you, buddy!

@_date: 2013-04-03 21:25:34
it hit $110! Not for 3 hrs, but it's now possible! im watching with bated breath!
@_date: 2013-11-17 09:44:32
my take(let him answer though): there was a problem completing the ACH transfer of $6k, but they gave him the 50BTC he ordered anyways. The reason for this problematic transfer were not for my knowledge :/ So he went and fixed the transfer(afaik. this is where the screen share came in), but now they are demanding $6k WORTH OF BTC back. I guess at this point it wouldnt be too difficult, but if he actually did complete the ACH, then its BS. 
i agree coinbase is a legit company, so the emails I saw on his screen screen from olaf (i think dated 11 days ago) seemed WAY strange. like he wasnt even responding to what the guy said.

both, i bet. its REALLY hard to be so devoted as to take it in full btc. in fact they might first pay you in $ so that the papers/numbers all add up on tax day, and then convert it no-fee? iduno.
it looks like a WONDERFUL position, except for the nyc/35k thing. i think BITInstant is one of the best horses to bet on, and anyone who can help field the shitty customers while expanding the brand in the  city in the world WILL WIN BIG.

smart. i think if you dont NEED the money and if you believe this has the potential that thinks it does... this is a no brainer.
i got in almost 2 yrs ago after the $31 crash using this logic(without :( ). 
risky, but now even after the crash, it's still like 2000% up :/

i dont know :( i was just joining in on the fun of calling someone else a pussy for not risking felonies. technically, besides a little bit of poker, i havent used it for drugs/cigars yet either. ive SHOWN a ton of people how to use silkroad and tor and bitcoin... but i won't dare throw my home address into that box.

because it was the very first system of its kind to give much more fair economic power to everyone on earth rather than .01% of the wealthiest. ya, it might have failed, and it still might. but if you had told me(provably) 2 years ago that you have a system, i'd have expected this growth too.

roger ver told me at a trade show. i was nice, but i didnt believe him at first. went back to the hotel, googled it, got amazed, then spent the next month or so witnessing the 2011 "bubble" which obviously looks like a speed-bump now. after the crash, i got in and havent looked back.

Immediately implement fiscal responsibility, and not just announce "more measures." I like the dollar. But they're killing it and making it look real ugly.

@_date: 2013-07-03 02:48:07
i see your skepticism, but bitcoin is not a controllable beast. just because new games(i mean... uh... "funds") are played on TOP of it, does not mean people wont have access to the underlying protocol, which will continue to work. 
This will simply be a sandbox for people to play in. We, of course, will play with the real-deal - without cute little rules to cushion our losses. 
But not everyone wants that game, and i say LET THEM PLAY THEIR OWN. it will only move people to our side and remove some of the stigma that larger players have with it

the only way it could compete is by offering equal or better features. this speaks to points 2 and 3 more than 4 and 1, which I think are useless and moot and not a real threat.
it has nothing to do with "new technology." remember you asked "what prevents?" and NOTHING does. not only that, but its EASY. and yet... the closest competitor is litecoin. womp womp.

my guess is hardware wallets. once there are little keychains(starting with the geeks ofcourse) that are able to spend cash, the next real upswing will begin.
ive already told small bar/coffee shop owners(friends of mine) about the fees. they loved the idea. none of them have implemented it though. once it's easier than a little credit-card terminal(and it IS easier. just not for THESE guys) and cheap, it will also push the next big upswing. 
i hope :/

first off, let me just say, bravo for keeping this discussion going. you're answering TONS of people and not being shitty. serious props.
second off, the whole POINT of bitcoin is the stability. sure, it's kind of flying off the handle right now, but it already corrects and is already much more stable as time goes on... unlike the rest of the world. 
we all want a good system of exchange, and if we can remove a human agent from the equation,... i think that's all the better. also i think the future peace of the world will depend on a singular economy(coz the only thing that's stronger than religion is money!) and i think this is a good way to achieve it.

it was overall positive for bitcoin.

i was upset at the end when he claimed we dont really know the "limit" or the "rules." Like... YES WE DO.
