I've literally never seen someone in person who knows what bcash is and supports it. They must exist though, as these are tons of Bitcoin cash posters around campus.

A game doesn't use 100% of your hardware's power 100% of the time. Mining however, does. This means you have to closely watch temperatures, fan speeds, and dust levels. Yes they are both using the same hardware, but mining utilizes it much more fully than any game could. Definitely don't OC if you decide to do this. Maybe every try your hand at undervolting, it makes a huge difference.

Miningpoolhub with multipool miner is way less sketchy but kinda long to setup. You should Google this though, apparently there are other not sketch GUI based options now.

Mining alt-coins on a gpu like that is possible, but it would be really taxing on the small laptop fan inside and fill the heatsink with dust real fast.  IMO, don't do it unless you know you can easily replace the fan/clean the heatsink.

(note that I would avoid Nicehash at all costs but that calculator is pretty accurate

I still don't get how ripple has grown past ETH without the blockchain tools and ability to run a node like with other changes.
If it grew as big a market cap as BTC that's terrifying. It undermines many of the principles cryptocurrency was founded upon. No other alt-coin is like that for good reason (at least no other that I'm aware of).

If you're interested in buying/selling with any degree of frequency, check if Gemini operates in your state.  Coinbase has so many high fees compared to basically everywhere else.

I really want Amazon/instacart to accept crypto, it would be really cool to use it for real things as originally intended.
