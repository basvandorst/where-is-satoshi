I think the real question is how is it even remotely as good as fiat in its current state.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:08:07
But that's creating more middle men and assuming that there are connected channels to your route which incurs a fee every time you channel hop right? I mean maybe if they make it so that it automatically finds the channel for you that removes the difficulty of having to find someone to channel piggyback off of, but even still it is going through all these channels just to make a direct transaction.

it just did on gdax
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:38:07
Hmm :/ so then how would one hope that bitcoin would ever hope to compete with the current monetary systems?
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:16:41
Maybe build an AI that can scrub garbage posts as well then while still allowing maximum relevant "debate" in forums
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:09:45
100% incorrect*. The fact is that its ironic that you say that since I forgot about your post until YOU came back and messaged a month later that you "called the bottom correctly" because it bothered you so much that you never forgot. I made plenty already when the bubble hadn't obviously burst . I was just saying that I was right in assuming bitcoin was not back, tough luck. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:05:22
lol no I don't. And you called a bottom with an obviously strong support line at the time. Wasn't much of a leap. I was referring to any insinuation that bitcoins low was going to end and we were just going to randomly start to rising longterm is bad advice. If you recall, I said "For all we know these "bull runs" that last 1-2 days in the week could be pump and dumpers." Wanna know what I think now? lol.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:20:39
I feel like there's a lot of special cases you aren't considering. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:46:31
Aaaand we back

Currency is a different ballgame than a forum... False equivalency to just say "hey they're both decentralized, nuff said"
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:03:58
Yup, not another totally made up statistic
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:54:54
Honestly, its not even difficult to put submission restrictions on merged code and only allow the most veteran group of contributors to have real vote power to push changes up. Likewise, theres also configs that allow you to require multiple devs to have reviewed it. Practices usually require smaller, broken out patches to be done so that its much easier to see what the patch and code is doing. Really doubtful about intentionally "malicious code" being introduced that gets passed the devs. What is probably more likely is that theres some security flaw or someone finds a way to hack bitcoin that the code didn't intend for. However, as we know, this new blockchain technology will be hard to hack for awhile until hackers and, the technology used to do that, progress to that state as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:50:46
Highly debatable actually. If you have a smaller pool of devs that are working on it then it can also be more likely that they are the ones who really know the project or have been the ones working on it the most and therefore know the architecture best. If you only have a small handful of veteran developers reviewing the code its harder to miss "malicious code"
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:04:04
Wasn't it credit card? and do bank transfers then?
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:32:14
No one said it would be? No need to presume anything since you obviously can't think for yourself :) keep living off your lower class salary and I'll keep making yours in a month buddy.

As someone who is actually currently in the industry and have worked on a multitude of projects in many languages and predominantly did C for the beginning part of my career, I can say that you seem to have a clear bias for C for some reason. Not sure if you ever branched out to anything else, but anyone in software engineering can tell you it has some pros as well as its own set of blatant cons. And this has nothing to do with "I never make mistakes." It has its limitations as a language. It's really only useful for embedded systems and systems programming because again, every language has things it is good at as well as things its terrible at. Being part of an "older" generation doesn't mean you stop growing and keeping up to date with what else there is to offer.
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:35:19
Eh, each language does a specific thing better than the other. Don't start shitting on any specific language now cause that doesn't sound knowledgeable :P
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:44:58
That's hardly a use case :/ In software engineering use cases are usually backed by a driving force. Like I want to do X by doing Y so that Z may happen.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:12:48
Yeah, gotta agree with moritz. That was pretty narrow thinking. Step 1. Think like a developer and/or a stakeholder. Step 2. Research block chain and how each cryptocurrency is using them. Step 3. Find out what use cases they are good at solving (and which they are bad at). Each design will have its limitations; therefore, saying there is only bitcoin for all your crypto needs is the equivalent of claiming that vicks vaporub can cure anything and everything.

It's know ones fault you don't know how to invest. You simply need a strategy when going into the market. Have fun at your trailer home mad at the people making side money while you're struggling to pay bills :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:17:18
But cmon. This thing is far from over and people jump like a dog in heat every time it leaps a little from being tired of falling too much now and then.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:01:59
I made 86%
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:34:50
Yet another pointless group of charts lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:36:06
Hold up, did I say 86%? I meant 1 gazillion percent!
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:14:35
Nope lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:36:30
See, my point proven. You are clearly too stupid to invest which is why you have to come to r/bitcoin just to try and insult people. It's called stop limits genius. I haven't ever lost a single thing because I simply know when the right time to invest is and have stop limits to pull me out when things go low. Even now there are clear periods when it jumps up that I still find to make a really nice profit while you sit there with a dunce cap on saying everyone has to lose money just because the overall value is getting cheaper. Just stick to your silly non-technical political subreddits and go on pretending like your uneducated opinions matter there :)
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:43:59
Oh look, more advice that didn't pan out at all.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:31:30
Right, that's not the point. The point is you probably shouldn't take biased advice that he gets paid to say whether he believes it or not.
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:56:03
Hey guys, looks like we are in the "Start of a bear run"
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:01:27
He literally gets paid to tweet about crypto though...
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:27:16
Once again pushing the echoing idea that predictions aren't as straightforward as you think. Face it, the outlook of bitcoin right now everywhere outside this subreddit is negative based on the overall series of bad news, declining interest, momentum, and volume, and mini dead cat bounces that never seem to hold. For all we know these "bull runs" that last 1-2 days in the week could be pump and dumpers. Predictions are useless at this stage 
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:30:33
Why do people even listen to this guy
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:01:07
What if April fools joke is really btc going up. You know, since that's the actual thing that's happening on april fools day lol.
