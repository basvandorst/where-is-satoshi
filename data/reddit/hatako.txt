The Problem is, all of The current Dips Are driven by emotional Buy/sell activities...

 do u think BTC will Go up After The adjustment ? I mean it Seems pretty Logic that it will. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:27:17
Do we know The Date of The BTC adjustment ?

It converges to 21million with time n ---&gt;infinite ...and there will be an n0 such as for every n &gt; n0, the distance, | current amount of BTC - 21million|&lt; epsilon, with Epsilon &gt; 0, so we can get arbitrary close to 21million. Obviously not in the lifetime of any of us here
Doesn't matter if 21million or 21million - 1 BTC, it's still bounded. But ye, if they would increase the coinbase it would anyways result in massive loss of value. 
Although the 21million is a good choice, it mirrors the maximum capacity of a 64-bit floating point number.

Do U think it will effect The current BCH Price ?
