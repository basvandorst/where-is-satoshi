You do.  And Cincy has a top 20 combined record in the nation over the past 10 years.  Central Florida is 45th in that same span.

No, you are so wrong on this it's astounding.  The Belk Bowl is not similar to the St. Pete bowl in any way.  UNC got to play in the Belk bowl because of their location to the game and Belk has a fairly early selection from the ACC.  It is in Charlotte and a hotbed for UNC fans.  Cincy got to play in it because the Belk has the 3rd selection from the AAC and Cincy is probably the flagship school of the conference now.
The payout for the Belk Bowl is 1.7 million dollars and the payout for the St. Pete bowl is 500k.  Again, not even close in terms of prestige.
At the 10th selection the St. Pete bowl literally has to take whatever team is available to them, if the ACC even gets 10 teams eligible which isn't a guarantee.  Clemson, FSU, VT, GT and UNC are literally, 100% undeniably going to be taken way before they get to 10 because the other bowl games know how much money they are going to bring in.
I suggest you head over to and look at the thread we have there.  Actual college football fans weighing in on the situation and showing you what you should really expect.

Cincy is the flagship.  One good year from UCF doesn't negate the fact that Cincy has been a power in the conference since 2005.
UNC has the largest fanbase in North Carolina by far.  Doesn't matter that there are multiple.
Yes, you are going to get a team from the ACC in the bowl game.  But that team isn't going to be Clemson like you suggested.  It is going to be Pitt, Cuse, BC or Duke 99% of the time.

This thread is just full of misinformation.  Honestly the Dogecar sponsorship is going to get a hell of a lot more coverage than this sponsorship.  No one gives a shit about the St. Pete bowl and that comes from a fan of a team that is in a conference that has a tie-in to it.

No, Clemson/FSU/VT or any other so called 'power' will never ever ever ever 100% never be in this bowl.  With the 10th tie in that means that the bowl has the 10th selection of the teams in the conference that are bowl eligible.  These bowls have no obligation to choose a team based on how they finished in their conference standings.  Clemson has such a huge fan base that even if they went 6-6 one year they would be snatched up probably around spots 5-7 in the bowl selection process and very likely ahead of teams with better records.

Yup.  It's alright though.  We are in the bitcoin sub and not the college football sub so I expect it to happen.

It's the 6th tie in for the AAC and not the 2nd.  A lot of misinformation being thrown around in this thread.

It's the 6th tie in for the AAC.  Not 2nd.  I would kill myself if our 2nd bowl tie in was the St. Pete bowl.
