Will Ripple allow interest rates to be charged on open credit lines? If not I don't see how the system can overcome adverse selection i.e. I could allow a creditworthy friend $200 max credit while limiting a non-creditworthy friend to $10, that does not imply I think loaning $10 to each is equally risky. My non-creditworthy friend is more likely to take up the credit so bad credit will drive good credit out of the system.

We are not integrated with escrow yet but you can use your freedom of contract to sign an addendum to our arbitration agreement stipulating that a certain escrow would be used, or even that both parties have to put a certain amount of money in this escrow upfront pending the arbitration award.

Hi, 
We can always talk. Regarding bitcoin transactions, you can either use "2 out of 3" transactions so transactions gets blocked in case of conflict or you need the user profiles in the new judge.me system I explained here to shame people into complying with arbitral award.

It's just a hunch but I think an attack is more likely from China than from the US. Reason being that if the US will lose its reserve currency status anyway, the US government will prefer to move to a sound currency system rather than making the world China's oyster for the next century. The Chinese will be pissed because they don't see their expected ROI on all the government junk bonds they bought.

I am confused. The bitcointip bot seems to use $60 USD as the value of a bitcoin 1 hour ago, I just checked Mtgox and it says value is now 114 USD with today's low at 72 USD. What is it?
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:18:07
Honestly you don't want hyperinflation. Best scenario would be to have the entire West be like Japan for a decade or two now, plenty of times for Bitcoin and Open Transactions to render the legacy systems obsolete.

Is there a way to issue a partial multisig transaction?
Say "2 of 3" multisig transaction with:
- The merchant who puts the btc in to send
- An arbitrator
- Open spot for anyone to claim (people that file dispute go here)
Not sure if this is possible? Or is their other workaround where arbitrator has right to send btc around for x amount of time.
Just trying to figure out a way for arbitration to be possible after the dispute arises...

The only reason I could see for slightly negative free market interest rates is protection costs. Digital vault service basically.
Edit: But than again, there will many of such services with different degrees of 'reserve ratios' (lower reserves, higher interest because the bank can make loans) and the market will decide what I wants.

Yes in terms of time, no in terms of coins. I was starting a business and had no spare cash before, now I think it's overpriced :)
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:40:54
I like this idea too but don't think we should force providers on the judge.me platform to be open source. If the market wants most arbitration providers to be open source the firms will do so for marketing purposes. If not, than not.

You can pretty much expect Coinbase to never want to deal with payments of $10K USD or higher, "to stay in compliance".
@_date: 2013-03-12 21:56:35
That understanding is correct. I am just saying that to the extent your contract clauses cover the dispute scenarios you won't end up in arbitration to start with. By default when a judge.me arbitrator is appointed his judgment will be needed.

1. PGP keys look interesting, thanks for the tip. Could you please elaborate how exactly such a website for PGP signed facts should look like? Also, how would you implement signing with a BTC address? And finally, do you have any examples of other services successfully using PGP keys?
2. It's not the bitcoin I want to taint, it's the person holding the stolen coins. I agree that most likely people won't care if you hold coins that were stolen 6 transactions ago, just like nobody cares now if the USD in your pocket were once used to do an illegal trade with. However, as a platform I think judge.me should allow for this tracking, because a polycentric should not force any outcome.
3. Open TX is awesome and can indeed be tracked by also allowing claims for them just as for bitcoin transactions. Ripple soinds great as well in theory although not sure how it is catching on in practice.

We are at 70K daily transactions now: 
$200 / 70 is close to 3.
I track this stat to see when to buy, most of the time it was $1 USD btc value per 2000 transactions. Now it's $6 per 2000 transactions.
Be cautious.

Shouldn't you move USD to react to a crash? Or you plan to panic sell when it bottoms out?

The author is thinking in bitcoin. A cent is thus a bitcent.

Edit: This comment is about the CURRENT judge.me
Judge.me has no case law like that, the arbitration is ex aequo et bono which means "based on fairness and equity" as determined by the arbitrator.
If the case law is clear to both parties wouldn't they just settle?

Tax havens are third degree 'price' differentiation that allow the most anti-tax individuals a route of escape by suffering from some transaction costs.
Without tax havens, governments would have to have one tax code for all its citizens. Be my guest, you just gave a lot of wealthy people millions in incentive to lobby for a smaller government.

This is not about average transaction value.
This is about the amount of transactions.
Relative to the price, this bitcoin 'economy' is lagging.
@_date: 2013-10-05 06:41:47
Huh? What's the issue?
- A cent is 0.01 bitcoin
- 0.001 = 0.01 / 10
- =&gt; 0.001 bitcoins is a tenth of a cent.

Am I correct in thinking Hawala is a system much like Ripple?
@_date: 2013-03-12 04:13:46
This is exactly the idea. There needs to be an open source non profit project that builds a base platform for reputation and arbitration so commercial agorist projects can be launched much more easily on top of it.
Edit: With "doing arbitration" I mean judge.me should track which bitcoin transactions have a claim filed against them. The actual arbitration process (whether over email, in person, ...) could be done by a commercial third party that connects via the API. To get things started we can also allow judge.me users to declare themselves arbitrators for a fee and build a basic arbitration system for them to do their hearings.
