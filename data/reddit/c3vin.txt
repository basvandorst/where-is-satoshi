This is actually a very well balanced, informational statement.

Coinbase is an exchange, not a bitcoin trading market.  For those looking to convert fiat to BTC, it works great.  Since fiat is involved, the govt is involved.
I'd love to trade face to face but living in a rural area makes it difficult.
I see more value in a legit exchange than I do driving an hour somewhere to trade with, what is in my case, a complete stranger. 
Although with distributed exchanges popping up finally, I may be using coinbase less.

There's a waiting period, but that is the result of fiat, not Bitcoin.

OK - Ask is a more fair term.  
Famous people endorsements are great marketing opportunities.  I feel like it would be good publicity for bitcoin and Banksy is a master of public promotion.
Not sure how an anonymous auction for anonymous goods would work, but hey, just wanting to get some creative juices flowin :D

I think there is something to be said about being anti-company when it comes to bitcoin.
I think your bitcoin stack looks great since centralized, trust third party dependencies have essentially been eliminated, aside from coinbase.
Yes, we must currently use mytrezor.com to send / recieve, but soon that will be solved with electrum plugin.
Yes, we must currently use a centralized exchange for trades, but that will soon be solved by bitsquare.
It's good that people are anti-thesecompanies because that's what bitcoin is built on + what is driving future enhancements.

If this story is real, it may be a good idea to keep under the radar a bit more on public internet forums :|

Should've been the thread title
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:56:18
totally agree.
Just giving a counter argument OP's comment on anti-thosecompanies posts.
I use coinbase myself, but excited for bitsquare to allow decentralized trading :D

I think maybe some people are concerned with [Blockstream's recent patent applications for side chains](  While LN isn't currently under application for patent, is it logical to assume that LN could be a patented Blockstream innovation?  Do patented innovations used for transactions qualify as 3rd party?
