I don't know what's going on but have an upvote

The hope is that one day all Bitcoin wallets will be LN wallets and the end user doesn't know or care what's happening at the backend. All the user sees is instant transactions at near zero fees.

Small correction: unconfirmed transactions expire after 3 days so no payment would ever take a couple of weeks to settle.

I think I'll wait for Trezor 2....

Isn't there a malleability related issue that's currently stopping the implementation of payment channels using CLTV and that's why we'd need Segwit to implement Lightning Network as envisioned by the developers? I remember them saying it's still sort of possible without Segwit but far from ideal due to transaction malleability.

I'd personally use it to lock up bitcoin for 12 month periods, i.e. every month lock up a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin for 12 month periods so I'm not tempted by every ICO out there. My future self would definitely be happy I hodled..

How is a difficulty adjustment a spam attack?

Isn't the downside of nLockTime the fact that the tx isn't sent out to the network until the time specified in nLockTime? So if i set nLockTime to 6 months from now I have to keep my wallet live for 6 months (or at least start it up just before nLockTime is reached) whereas CLTV sends it out now and the lock time resides on the UTXO on the blockchain?

Isn't this what the theory says? After such a huge increase there's a huge decrease before a huge increase? Time is on our side guys, hodl!

Replace Ethereum with any Bitcoin-based smart contract layer (Counterparty, RSK, etc) then. My question is still is it useful to invest the next few years of your life learning coding so you can write smart contracts if you want to pivot towards blockchain technology in your future career.

They keep getting the reward for empty blocks don't they? Their incentive is monetary reward and that's what they keep getting from empty or full blocks.

"...has joined the Toronto Stock Exchange as its new chief digital officer" is misleading as he's been there for a year now and the article explicitly mentions this fact.

Regardless of the 30 people who could come up from scratch with a cryptocurrency based on a decentralized blockchain I'm thinking of the broader picture. The thousands of developers working on alt-coins, exchanges, wallets, smart contracts, the hundreds, if not thousands of developers employed by global companies working on (ill-fated) consortiums and private blockchains. You don't think someone should commit to joining them on a technical/developer level if they feel bitcoin and blockchain is the technology of the future?

From Cyprus, can confirm. In 2013 the two largest banks literally confiscated huge parts of regular depositor's deposits after the banks went bankrupt by getting greedy and buying huge amounts of Greek junk bonds in previous years.
Under the European deposit guarantee scheme the first €100,000 in any account was not touched while the rest was fair game. Popular Bank took everything above €100,000 while Cyprus Bank took 40% of everything above €100,000.

No it's pretty clear it's going to proof of stake if you follow what's happening in the Ethereum space. The beacon chain (PoS) will go live January or Q1 the latest. Seven test clients sycned up between them for the first time last week.
