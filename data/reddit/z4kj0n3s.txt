SourceForge hosting something malicious? Weird!

I'll start the research by mourning the Bitcoins my 18 year old self mined with my very own GPU back in mid/early 2010. I had like four of those fuckers. Bitcoin was worth shit, and 18 year olds have no sight for the future. RIP. :(

Yeah, I'm sure I am. Maybe it was the later in the summer? Maybe I had more, but I'm pretty sure it was only single digits. It would be more reasonable that I was part of a pool.
I didn't even realize the importance of it until about two years ago, so I never bothered remembering. :p 
Sometime in 2010, I lost around 5 Bitcoins through negligence. Keep it simple.

People capable of creating something like Bitcoin don't send out emails as poorly written as the one on the left.

Yeah, I custom-build all my mobile devices too.
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:33:15
Jesus. *gag*
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:26:31
no? What are you even talking about? It's as simple as don't let any one entity control 51% of the block chain. Are you one of those right-wing types?

The 'us'  in this statement is the community, not Mozilla.

It's exactly the intention of the original question. Why would you care if the person in the photo could be identified if he's not doing something illegal?

I really wish I had the money to do things like this. I love seeing this kind of content on Reddit, but someone has to pay for it. In this case, we had a great guy that was willing to donate his money, but they're rare. Big ups to him, and I hope I can create similar content someday. :)

I think $7.50 is a good amount for 'free lunch'.
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:06:56
Aw, damnit. I just bought 3 months at full price a few days ago. :p
EDIT: Aww. :') My first ever gifted gold! Thanks kind stranger! I hope you find $5 you forgot about!
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:00:40
Why not ten? Double your money in a few months. (Or halve it. Who knows?!)
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:44:13
Right? "Mere"? *sigh*

After reading this thread, I closed my PayPal account. I've read too many terrible stories about them, and the country duplicates is just too fucking pathetic. Good riddance to bad rubbish!
@_date: 2014-06-26 21:56:01
Definitely just you.
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:56:15
I guarantee you, if I can do something, there's WAY more than 100,000 people that can do it too.

"That isn't to say that I WILL pay. Just that I'll think about it  for longer before I go back to wherever I was."

What part of "Fundamental to Bitcoin's security design" do you not understand?
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:54:51
Why would those people want anything to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-07 07:29:58
There are SO MANY ways to do online purchases without a *credit* card. This has to be a joke.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:49:52
Glad to see XBT coming into vogue.
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:17:48
is that way
@_date: 2015-05-16 23:52:28
Exclusively on cryptocurrencies since 2013? Sounds like you need a publicist or something. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:42:47
Which is interesting, because Google semi-regularly threatens themselves with other (still internal) products. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:10:46
Definitely. I'd buy it without the "r/" Super funny.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:41:14
I would like to have Bitcoin again. :)
It's been a very, very long time since I used this wallet. :p
Edit: It would also be cool of you to donate to the EFF!
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:51:35
Ah yes, the perfect solution for the people of Venezuela! Now that they can access their bitcoin via satellite, they can get back to worrying about where to shit hygienically, finding clean water, electricity, and eventually, even food!
e: Y'all advocating a payment system that requires electricity and internet connectivity in a country that is currently struggling to maintain both need to do some sanity checks lol
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:52:47


So it's dead, then? :p
@_date: 2016-02-04 00:57:47
Thank you for pointing this out! Armory was my go-to wallet when I owned bitcoin; I'd be very sad to find it missing in the future.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:18:17
DEFINITELY not good for Bitcoin. At least, not any more than any other form of payment. I absolutely do not want my nice car rented out anonymously. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:20:35
I don't think you'll ever be in charge of that anyway. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:15:40
Damn, man, you spend as much on Bitcoin in a month as I make in a month. College life blows. :p
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:41:48
I mean, is that really a face though?
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:12:47
The trick is in knowing what to look for though. I never notice until after the fact. :s
