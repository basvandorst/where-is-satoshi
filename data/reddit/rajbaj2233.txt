Monero will do the trick for you.

Thanks. Great advice. I don’t really have any debt other than my car payment (unfortunately it’s a lease) and my mortgage. Gonna be hard to pay that off, even partially. But I get your point. Thank you.

Aw man...that sucks! But you can build back up, just be harder this time I guess. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:37:44
That is sage advice. I guess I just wanted to know if there are any here with some substantial holding and if they would like to share their outlook on this whole venture.

I completely agree with you on the upcoming dips. However, I am not sure what you mean by diversify, do you mean in terms of alts, or something other than crypto altogether?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:08:10
Yea, I now what you mean. I’d like to have this happen without needing a global recession, but I guess that may be inevitable.

I see your point, and I agree. We need a lot more widespread adoption so we can at least compete with fiat, if not completely get rid of it! I feel in the coming years we shall see an exponential rise in adoption and hopefully that will change the outlook of many of these people who cant wait to cash out.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:23:34
Agreed. I am wondering how they will track down people and transactions.

I legit watched this for a fucking minute and half to see if he could grab the fucking ball! ��������

I agree. Also, I hope the SEC and the IRS dont make it too hard for people to transact in BTC. I do feel that the market cap will get there in a few years.

I'm not your buddy, guy!

I know, right? I hope there is a rise in widespread adoption soon, which I do believe will happen. Hopefully that should change that mentality of cashing out.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:37:00
Yes, I see your point. And yes, I feel gold is a store of value. By the way, I believe that BTC is a store of value, my question really meant how many other people share that viewpoint, and if they do, are they still thinking of cashing out at a certain point, instead of using the BTC for actual transactions.

I have heard the same thing being said by some other people. Not sure if I should be looking forward to that, or if I should be dreading that.

Good for you! :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:22:17
Not sure if you are referring to me as a marketing company, but if you are...lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:43:28
Awesome! Good for you!
