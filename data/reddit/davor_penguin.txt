Only if it is stealing at all you dumb fuck.
Since we are using names, you waste of a cum rag, how do you not understand this?

I did not say that is the only use of bitcoin.  I said I believe it is the biggest reason it is as huge as it is. I do believe once other options are more readily available that it will be the start of the decline of btc, especially as King.
Yea the alt was down. So was bitcoin. The new ratio was off making it no longer as cheap. I'm not saying it isn't still a good buy, simply that had transaction times been better, or the alt for fiat available, I would have had access to the trade I wanted. Claiming that makes everything I said bullshit is completely retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:44:52
Good for you. I am too. 
Nowhere am I saying to dump or that this dip is a problem. The tldr is watch for when more coin to fiat/coin transactions are possible and their effect on btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:50:26
So if this is the case, and it can handle increased traffic and not bottleneck still, adoption of this would affect my view a lot. 
My stance would still be the same, but it would massively push back the date and effects. Maybe making it impossible for it to ever happen (yay).
Largely depends on how long implementation takes though. But I would expect big exchanges to adopt it sooner than later before they lose customers.

Give it a few days after this reddit post blew up, I'm sure we shall see it somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:56:12
Oh come on, you know we all already have Reddit open on our phones.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:44:44
Dude you are the one completely missing the point the other guy was making.
It is likely that, like a bank, Coinbase is required by law to halt/delay transactions exceeding a certain value in a short amount of time. This is to combat money laundering etc, whether or not you are actually part of it.
That, combined with how overwhelmed Coinbase already is, leads to fiat/coins being held up for so long.
Nothing about that is illegal, as Coinbase never claims the funds are theirs, nor are they stealing them. Hence why he asks you what it is you believe they are doing illegally. The chunk of text you quoted does not support any notion of illegal activity.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:49:20
I call bullshit. First place I checked (goldmoney.com) only charges a 0.5% fee to trade metals, a 0.75% fee to exchange them, and a .01-.015% storage fee per month. 
Compared to their 2.5% trading fee and .085% storage fee for cryptocurrencies. Which is still much less than you pay simply to get your crypto out of most exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:56:08
Thanks for the read. 
So if I understood it all correctly in my limited time viewing, it says the energy consumption costs are estimates of what all the miners pay. And that it is supposed to drop in the future.
So impact on the crypto economy relies on how quickly bitcoin rises vs costs fall, and how spread out the miners are (ie is the consumption mainly from two countries, or 50).

If you could, donating anything to help with ALS would be amazing. A few years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with it, and was dead within 5 months.
Watching someone you love become trapped in their own body, fully aware of what is happening, yet unable to do anything, is truly heartbreaking. 
The ice bucket challenge brought the public's attention to als, but the fight is far from over. 
[Als.net]( and [Project ALS]( are some good ones. There are quite a few others out there so anyone feel free to chime in with suggestions.
But congrats on your gains, and thanks a bunch from/for everyone you are helping with this. A great idea indeed.

I've been here for 4 years myself. I still consider that fairly new, but I can see from the comments many others don't and I'm getting shit for simply saying I'm "fairly new" (as if that somehow invalidates any observations on data, trends, and experiences). So I'll probably change that in the OP.
Anyways, I agree that many dips have happened, and that alts have been shilled as the next btc and that the end is near. I'm not doing any of that though. I believe this dip right now is just that, a dip, and we will continue to rollercoasger for at least another year. I just think that at some point it has to end. Or at least bitcoin will drop a bit and stop growing at these explosive rates. Largely because other options that are objectively better, but less popular and accessible, do exist. 
Yea but the fees on gold and paper are drastically lower than on bitcoin. Bitcoin you pay a fee to fund your exchange, a fee to buy it, a fee to get it out of said exchange (often ridiculously high flat rates, especially for the ones outside of the US), more fees everytime you trade/buy with it, and then taxes on top of that. Quite a bit different than for gold or paper, and much less accessible to the average Joe when fixed rates are involved, and large sums aren't.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:42:51
It has a huge impact on the number of people using bitcoin though. And the availability of other coins to the general public. Average Sue from down the street isn't going to buy bitcoin to trade to another exchange to trade for another coin to send to another wallet. She will just buy bitcoin because it is popular and easy. 
If you could buy more coins for fiat, that would change.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:28
I fully agree with this. 
I think the reliance on btc feeds into its populairty and ckntributes to price. If other options become available before btc has fixed fees and transaction times,, it could be a problem. If not, bitcoin will stay king for a while. Other more anonymous coins will definitely gain more traction though as they obtain better gui wallets and more purchasing options.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:44:32
Not that i doubt your story, and my experiences with Quadriga have been less than stellar themselves (never dealt with mybtc.ca yet), but can you provide any proof?
Screenshots of these emails for example would go a long way to lending credibility.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:45:08
New people can't have opinions? New people can't make observations based on trends an data and experiences? Yea sure.
And by new I mean I've been involved since 2013/14. New in terms of bitcoin as a whole, but by no means in recent terms.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:03:56
Yea. Those say very different things. The reason something is popular is not necessarily the same reason it is useful. 
Bitcoin obviously has uses as a technology and a currency, my original post even states this. I do believe better options exist though. Also stated above.
I didn't even say the reliance on btc is why people buy it. Obviously most people buy it as an investment and for quick gains. I'm saying if other coin for fiat and/or coin options were available, there would be less incentive for everyone to have bitcoin.
There are tons of arguments to be made about the ideas in my post. And I would love to hear them, see new perspectives, and maybe change my own. Try focusing on those instead of nit picking issues that don't exist.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:16:16
True true true. I guess it depends on your view of crash. I meant as in it will lose a bunch of value and while it will continue to grow and be a thing, it will never return to how it was.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:55:00
But now their withdrawal fees are ridiculous. 0.0025 BTC is way too high a fixed fee for anyone trading with less than $500
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:10:10
Obviously not if you do it yourself. If you use these guys to do it (and insure it) there is a fee. Dumb and totally unnecessary, but I was simply quoting what options they offer. Has no impact on my point though 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:51
Does it really eat up much power to the average user though, or just the miners?
If it just the miners, I'm not sure how mich impact that would actually have. Since they willingly go into it hoping their power costs will be offset by future gains. Which so far it has been.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:35
Note the part where I clearly stated to take what I say as you will precisely because of what you quoted. Pretty clear this is simply my opinion and looking for a discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:34:48
Segwit is a massive step up, and I am curious to see the final outcome when it is 100% implemented. However, others have also been mentioning how it might not even be enough to fix the issues. Reduce yes, but not lower to the level if some other coins.
I admit I do not know enough of the technical details of segwit, and my only experience with it is still $10 fes via Ledger. Any other info on it would be appreciated. 
And, can it be fully adopted before people lose faith in btc due to fees/txs times and jump ship to other options which will be adopted by other big exchanges? Like how coinbase added bch in response to the drop in btc/ise in bch.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:22:43
I would feel much better. I love bitcoin. I would still think many people would leave when other coin to fiat/coin transactions are available, but I would no longer think the life of bitcoin is as closely tied to it.
I do hope they change these factors, but I'm not counting on that hypothetical.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:17:35
Yea buying bitcoin in Canada is such a hassle to get set up, not to mention the transaction times, that it will never be a viable currency until this shit gets easier. 
Then people are like "well these other coins have way faster times and whatnot so they make better currencies". Ok cool, but I almost always have to have bitcoin in the first place to buy them...
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:47:52
Yuuuuge*

What pissed me off with them last week was I logged in, bought some coins, and **then** they disabled my account. Like really? If you're doing this as a security measure at least fucking do it before all my coins are spent on something else. If not, kindly fuck off and let me use the exchange. 
Contacted them and only had to wait 4 days to get it reenabled though.
I hope you get your money back, and then tell this company to piss off and never use them again.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:05:09
If they gutt NN then it entirely depends how much they will charge people to access btc sites/exchanges. If ISPs are against BTC they can easily make it enough of a pain to use that many normies won't bother jumping in. 
If it doesn't get gutted, then maybe. I doubt the average person knows enough about NN, let alone BTC, to make the connection and move in though. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:16:33
Glad to help, here's hoping they help you!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:50:18
Good advice.
Although losses may be limited total value wise, but not necessarily when taken relatively to the person's monies.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:33:55
I mean, I hope there is massive civil uprising if NN is scrapped in the first place... 
But yea I doubt they'd do anything about it. Especially at first.

What dip? If it is still up over a 24 hour period, there was never a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:28:59
But it sounds much better when you can say it reached $9800

So roughly what kind of profits did you make overall, if you don't mind me asking?

At the current exchange value? A million dollars.

When I tried to log in right after finding out it was disabled, there was a link that asked me if I wanted to start the reenable process. Then that hooked me up with an email from mailer where I had to confirm to start the process. 
If trying to log in doesn't give you that option, try hitting up their support email: support

I like this strategy a lot actually. I do somethingthing similar, but with only two accounts. 3/4, or more, of my btc goes into my ledger - not to be touched for a long time. The rest goes into another wallet that I use for buying other coins, trying to day trade, etc. 
But I really like the idea of an account where every year I take out everything over 2x what I put in. Enjoy some gains, while slowly protecting yourself in the event of a collapse. Definitely stealing this. 
Right now I can't afford to have an account where I spend it on retail goods at whatever fees though. But if one has the funds, it is a good idea to help the economy and normalize the currency usaeage of btc.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:46:45
Same boat here! 
Saw the news and was like gotta tell people and rejoice! Then realized no one knows wtf any of this means.
Same happened with the ETH thing yesterday

Heh. I can't even go half a day without checking, let alone a year.

Are you able to only dump part of it at a time until you either get in a better situation, or have to use it all? 
I can't imagine you'd have to dump the entirety of at least several months profit.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:53:06
Um what? Why would my displeasure over my account being locked literally right after I made a trade, indicate anything about my level of understanding of crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:19:13
I feel like btc with vpns would be fine. They could definitely make wallets, txs, and even googling info about btc, harder though. Even just a bit harder would be enough to prevent a lot of people from entering.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:00
Still would have been solid gains

On another hand, from a different thread, [this]( is what it looks like in Portugal regarding mobile apps. You have to pay extra for data used on apps you aren't subscribed to.
I can easily see a "crypto" package becoming a thing...

Maybe blockchain tech will become commonplace and a "utility", but I seriously doubt Bitcoin itself will be. At most it will be like gmail or another email provider: important, but not a basic utility nor as important as email itself.
