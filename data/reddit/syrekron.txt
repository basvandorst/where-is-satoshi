Yes, that is the correct machine.  No additional software ordered.
I'll agree--the delay isn't that bad.  I just wish they'd have been up front about it in the first place.
Even with the delay, I am still looking forward to having the machine in hand.  It has been well over a decade since I've had a new laptop and buying it with bitcoin that I mined is icing on the cake.

Yes.  I'm a new reader with a new account.
I found the other threads about similar situations after the problems started.  I joined up and posted hoping to attract some helpful attention from within Dell.
I'm not bashing for the sake of bashing.  Now I'm trying to echo the warnings to others about what to expect from Dell's bitcoin payment system and customer support.  It is not what I expected and is not like the pleasant experiences I've had with multiple bitcoin orders and multiple support requests with Overstock.

How silly of me to take them at their word for their promise date before the sale and expect it to hold afterwards.
Okay, they're not amazon, newegg, or any other online retailer that I've dealt with.  Heck, they're not acting like the same Dell that I've ordered from in years past.
Lesson learned.

Any chance you'd be willing to take on my case also?  I just placed an order earlier this week (7/29) for a higher end latitude and am also stuck in the new customer bitcoin dell anti-fraud purgatory.  The polite folks on the support line at Dell seem unable to answer questions as to what is happening and are giving conflicting information about what is happening...sort of like they don't understand bitcoin and don't know how to work with it in their system.

14 inch i5 Latitude 7000 with win7 pro, 1920 x 1080 display, 8gb ram and a 256 gb ssd.
It was one of their standard options with no extra hardware or software.  The only add-on was the 3 year extended hardware warranty.
I don't think they customize the hardware for these.  The sales rep (not post sale support) told me there were only a few hardware configurations to choose from and that they couldn't mix and match.  I wanted the 1080p display with less memory and a conventional HDD.  I figured I could upgrade the ram and hdd myself for much less than Dell charges.
They might have to load the OS and any additional software though.  I could see that taking some additional time.

I'm sure your analysis is more correct than I'd like to admit.
It doesn't make sense to me to that a sale today is more desirable than a satisfied customer tomorrow...but then again I'm not in the commodity business.

Dell doesn't mention that they will add a 2+ day "processing period" to your order if you pay with bitcoin.  Their support team explains this as a standard practice.
It seems they have some "issues" to work out.

LOL.  Good point :)
OK--I'll admit I'm being impatient.
Aside from being in a hurry, I do have the gripe that Dell advertised an inaccurate delivery date before the sale only to change it afterwards.  If they would have presented a more reasonable date and noted the additional processing time for bitcoin payments before the time of the order I wouldn't be complaining at all.
