Be sure to read Bram Cohen's take on this (Bram invented Bittorrent) or an opposing view to Bitcoint XT:

Can you respond substantially?  Bram Cohen is a pretty smart guy and dismissing him out of hand like that seems very strange.

And then there was the DotCom bubble where big expectations crashed into reality.  Even then it wasn't the end of the Internet, but it only really became dominant about 8 years after the big crash.  Most of the players that were the high flyers in the crash disappeared except for a few (Amazon being one of them.)

What is this fetishing of hodlers?  You should sell high and buy low.  But to hold in the downward slope of a market crash, and pretend that is a good thing, that is just stupid.

The cryptocurrency revolution is not bitcoin.  It is the idea of cryptocurrency.  There is no guarrentee that bitcoin is going to be the winner in the long run.  It may, but it could easily be Etherium, or another innovative entry.  Bitcoin is merely the first, and currently it enjoys a lot of mindshare, but it is probably not the best technically or most flexible or nimble.
I think it is very much up in the air that it will be the overall long-term winner.
Back in the dotcom bubble people were big on AOL as it was one of the first online communities and internet providers, but who uses it now?  First is not necessarily the long-term winner -- sometimes it is but often it isn't.
