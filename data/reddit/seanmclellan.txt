Difficulty in obtaining bitcoins?  I've traveled all over the world and exchanging dollars to bitcoins is easier/faster than it has been for me to exchange dollars into euros, francs, yen, yuan, pounds, pesos or any other currency I can think of that I have had to use in the past.
Setting up a Coinbase account, for example, took only moments to do online and I can exchange dollars for up to 50 bitcoins every day. 
How is that difficult?

That probably explains it. CB &gt; CB transfers are likely off blockchain. Paying with a non CB wallet would have been on blockchain.

Ah, I see - when I read your comment "when you purchase via coinbase, it stays off the  blockchain" I was thinking you meant making the purchase via the coinbase API as per overstock integration... Not as in you sending a payment *from* coinbase on your side; but I see that you meant it the other way now.

Add me to the list. I've seen sqig offer up similar criticisms in other threads, and I've seen them be addressed and then he ignores or dismisses the answers.  
For example, in a previous thread, I shared some of my personal experience with how bitcoin has helped me save money on fees and allow me to be profitable by buying inventory from out of state and out of the country that otherwise wouldn't be profitable using traditional banking methods.
His response? No acknowledgement that bitcoin could be good for something... Instead, he claims I am "shady".  When I ask for clarification as to how being profitable by lowering costs via a new technology would be shady? He says "because it is". 
I sarcastically thank him for the insight and he calls me a dick.
It does seem like, as others have mentioned, that he is just looking for a fight and to be right - not to actually learn from anybody who is actually using bitcoin for real benefit and not just talking about it in the realm of theory.
I'm still open to being shown otherwise, though. And am still happy to address concerns and answer questions based in my own firsthand experience. 
Though so far I am seeing him talk about how hard it is to get bitcoin... And I have seen multiple people, myself included, mention how easy Coinbase is.  And his response so far has been to ignore Coinbase and continue to state it's nearly impossible.
Take that for what it's worth.

Coinbase generates a new receiving address for every new transaction... So any new purchase will show no history.  Once you complete your payment, you will see that it is included in the blockchain.  
There are instances where transfers inside of a single exchange are not included on the blockchain until the bitcoins leave that exchange; but that is a different issue than the payment address you were given not having any history attached to it.

If you are in the u.s. (which it looks like you are based on that WU fee) you could both use Coinbase.  1% fee on each side. So $12ish for you to convert dollars to bitcoins and $12ish for her to convert back to dollars.
There will also be an exchange rate difference in play; but it should turn out to be far less than WU.

Did you pay them using a coinbase account?

Re: driving, their website doesn't work for me.  I have tried numerous times and been in the phone and spoken with agents in person.  I enter in my debit card info, and the money is taken from my account and then a few hours later the transaction is rejected and it takes them 2 business days to get my money back to me.   None of their agents can help me to get it fixed and all tell me that they do not discuss why transactions are rejected and that I can just "try again".
Re: why not cashiers check or money order?
Much of my international business has to be completed within a matter of hours of a deal popping up.  Deal becomes available, I accept the deal and they need the money in 1 to 6 hours.  Cashier's checks or money orders would take days to arrive.  WU is expensive and is cumbersome.
Bitcoin?  Instant and free or nearly free. 
Your mileage may vary, of course, but that's my personal experience.

When bidding on some auctions, the winning bidder has a limited window to complete payment before losing out to the next bidder.  Pretty standard and I'm not sure why you would think a seller requiring fast payment would be sketchy. 
 If you try and buy  something from a local store and you told them "I have to buy a cashiers check and mail it around the world so you will get paid next week" but the guy in line behind me has cash and wants the same item, then the owner is going to sell to the guy behind me and not wait for my payment to hopefully show up eventually.

Oh.  
Thank you for your enlightening explanation.

Depends on your energy usage.  Trying to use energy the same way you do when connected to the power grid is definitely not going to work out to a net savings at this point.
However, I know of people with small energy efficient homes who use solar panels only and literally pay on average $50-$150 per *year* for their energy costs.  (Panels + deep cycle batteries + maintenance/repairs spread over length of use)
Just because everybody doesn't use solar energy in the same way doesn't mean it's a scam.

Depends on where you are located.
Are you in the U.S.?  Check out coinbase.  Only 1% fee.  More reasonable than exchanging for other foreign currencies in most cases from my experience.

That is quite interesting...  But I would ask you, who are "we"? I certainly don't owe 17 trillion dollars.

How did you arrive at the conclusion that a 12% fee is "free"?
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:45:02
But you are saying that you would hand the cashier $112. Which would be 12% on that particular transaction, right?  I was just confused as to how that would be considered free.  I do get that the fee percentage goes down as the amount increases, as I send a lot of WU payments myself. 
But issues I run jnto are that international sending stops at a maximum of $3,000. It's been very frustrating for me because their online option doesn't work with lots of banks (mine included). So I have to drive to a location... And last month I had to do 3 transactions to send money to one person due to the limits... I paid three fees, filled out the paperwork three times and it took them an hour to input all the transactions because it triggered a report that had to be sent to the IRS.  All of that plus drive time plus gas makes people like me very excited that bitcoin makes all those problems vanish for me.
