Adam is one of those guys who appreciates the application of technology - outside the pure tech space. I wouldn't be surprised if he convinces their suppliers to accept bitcoin. Holding coin is a solid start..

We demand Sen. Manchin's immediate resignation from the Senate banking committee for being "highly unstable and disruptive to our economy."

A response to his publicity stunt -

It shows that if he wants a publicity stunt, people won't be pleased with picking Bitcoin!

It looks like some people missed the rather obvious point. It's freaking irony.
**The quotations in the header are verbatim from Sen. Manchin's statement.** Utilizing his own words against him, the petition serves to show how ridiculous and unnecessary his claims are. The hyperbolic language that follows is still appropriate. Sensationalists should not abuse congressional committees which provide oversight to relevant regulatory agencies. 
Furthermore, when committee members make direct statements to regulators to act, regulators may be pressured to respond with what is often a hasty - and in this case unnecessary - enforcement action. Don't forget, administrative and regulatory bodies are usually rule making entities as well! Not so funny now, is it?
Sen. Manchin's pleas for a regulatory enforcement action against Bitcoin may be a stunt, however if repeated by others on oversight committees could lead to *real* regulatory enforcement.
