Once every available Satoshi has been mined, nothing really.  The Fed wouldn't even have to print money to do it.  Could just buy it at market price and never trade it again.  Being the ultimate hodler and rendering it useless.
Your only hope from a "hostile" take over would be to inflate BTC price to the point where it would be nearly impossible.  
Heads would explode.

Needs some R^2 to see if his trend line is remotely accurate.

Really depends, if you have an illiquid market even a small amount of volume can create large price fluctuations, up or down.
It begs the question do large fees and clogged up blockchains create an illiquid market.  Meaning if you put your fee at $50 for a bunch of small transactions at a high enough price, it will drive it there since your trades will clear first.
All fun and games.  Some one industries might analyze the trades to see if you have some form of market manipulation.
Any way, Market Cap for a currency is pretty meaningless.  It's worth is only relative to the current last trade price.

Without knowing the underlying market, covers for shorts or covers for longs.  Meaning as the futures expire you should see increased volatility.

You're pretty much right on.  GDAX will take wires and bank transfers.  Usually take 3-10 days.  Or fund it with your coin base wallet which if done with a credit card is going to hurt.

I'd be curious to see how many BTC were traded at that 20k mark.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:01:43
Shorting usually implies that you've some how "borrowed" BTC at the current price with the assumption that at some future date you'll replace the "borrowed" BTC at the going price.  You would then some how pay a "premium" on the "borrowed" BTC while you waited the market out.
Meaning if you shorted BTC, you would have borrowed at todays price and then replaced it at some future lower price making the difference between the two.  If at some future date it went higher you'd pay the difference.
The only vehicle for this kind of trading currently is in BTC futures.
The term you're looking for is day trading.  Or holding BTC short term.  I would issue one word of caution to this, while fun and perhaps profitable.  You are going to feel some pain when it comes time to file your 2018 taxes.

I'd agree you have built in support at the ~9Kish area.  How strong it is or what would drive capitulation should it break is a nice mystery.
When the wallstreets guys decide to test it hold on to your hats.

You have an article on the fed implementing their own crypto?
There are so many questions I would have about a centralized block chain the it would take me a week to write it up but if the FED is thinking about it, and you seem to have insight.  A bit of direction would be appreciated.

If you have a closed loop transaction meaning you are both the seller and the buyer.  You can do what ever you'd like to the price.  While futures might be regulated you have to put alot of faith into the exchanges that the trades and fair and legit.  Can be as simple as the algorithm that serves orders matching exact volume...
If you have the coin to gamble pick an exchange, place a buy order at a price below market with an exact volume.  Second account place a sell order with the same volume and ask price...
Let me know what you find. :)
Edit: People are placing alot of faith in the trader layers that really shouldn't be trusted until verified.

If I were trading bitcoin, I'd be doing it in the 15 second interval range, looking at 15 minute moving averages / volume.
I don't and haven't even trended any per minute moves, this graph is meaningless.  It's missing volumes / bid-buy correlations, transaction fees, speed of trades and I could go on but I won't.
You need much more underlying data, the kind I'm sure gdax or any other exchange is selling to real traders.  While the unit is new / unique.  Markets are well understood, don't misunderstand lack of knowledge, my own or yours, for improbability.

I recommend you look at real investment strategies.  Currently BTC is pure hype.  If your thought process is buy and hold, then there are many safer and perhaps higher return avenues to go with.
Pick a stock in the doghouse that you believe will turn around in 5 years.  Do some research and if you find something undervalued with a dividend, your strategy will pay off.  There's a reason Buffet states that compounding interest is the only way to make money.  Safely, securely and not gambling.
If you're after the gamble, then go for it but I wouldn't employ a buy and hold strategy for that.  Buy the dips sell the peaks and keep a close eye on and don't get greedy.

Newer people are likely trying to get in and make quick buck.

And make long posts on reddit, anonymously.
Another excellent qualification, is thinking of unrealized investments as losses or gains.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:30:08
It behaves like a dividend.  Same concept, you have a base stock which until the point is an unrealized gain or loss.  The chainsplit would be similar a dividend, now since it's in crypto, you'd realize that income as it's full value when you sell it.
Third parties create taxable events all the time for people, be it your bank with interest income or stock dividends.

Actually you'd rather slow and steady acceptance with steady growth than massive speculative correction.  From a long term standpoint for bitcoin and cryptos.  That it's the wild west at the moment doesn't bode well for general public acceptance as they see it as not a stable place to get into to.  That and any corrective burns to the weakhands will leave them wary of ever entering the space again.
The current trade volume is also ripe for price manipulation.  Again, any savy investor would notice it and not enter at a price point not volume supported.  Only looking at it from an adoption standpoint, what used to be small news are now national headlines.  Long term health and stability should be preferred over anything else.
As to your statement that it wipes out all concerns over a bubble.  From a Quant standpoint the current double top graphs tell you if compared against other investment classes that if the support level is broken it will take a deep long dive.  Just some perspective for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:20:02
You are conflating many things with this post.  Supply and demand versus a trade / exchange.  The act of selling or completing a trade only establishes the price it doesn't dictate it.  In order for a price to be set it must be traded.  Feel free to look up bid price vs ask price.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:35:58
Actually not too hard.  Where at one point you could mine with just your CPU and not part of a consortium, the block halving created the move to GPU and consortium mining and now unless you're buying an ASICs rig, your mining profits wont pay for the power bill and gear.
Granted some of this analysis is a bit flawed as the price of btc has soared but in general it's not very profitable to currently mine btc.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:34:43
I actually think that people much smarter than I, that have a math background, work on wallstreet and do quant analysis most likely can predict market behavior in the short term.  They do it all the time.
In the scheme of things BTC is probably easier to model than say a stock.  The charts and underlying data give you support levels (price where large chunks were traded at).
Can you predict the long term trends?  Most likely not.  Short term?  I'm sure there are other asset classes which have been modeled and with current valuations those smart guys might even waste some of their precious time to analyze it.
I agree with your warning though, at the moment it's so highly speculative, subject to pump and dump schemes and the one obvious Achilles heel is the fees, you manipulate the fees you can force market behavior on people.  Gamble at your own peril.

You, you I like.  There really is no altruistic reason for every trade there is a winner and there is a loser.

Unless you're properly setup, it will probably cost you more in electric bills than you'll make mining.
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:30:37
It's the design, basically diminishing returns.  Initially relatively easy to "mine" as more are "discovered" they becoming increasingly scarcer.  I'll see if I can dig up a link as to the concept.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:55:08
While true that getting "burnt" money / new money will be impacted by the volatility.  The "bubble" is relatively easy to inflate based on market volumes.
Looking at all the historical charts the "absolute" support level is ~$250.  That's where you have a large long term volume traded price stability.  Granted the cost of mining bitcoins is not profitable at that price range.  So to truly define how big this current bubble was/is.  You'd have to look at the current cost of mining and assume that is the current "true" support level.
In theory the inflationary nature of block reward halfing should dictate the inflationary growth and that can then be compared to it's current trending price.
Having said all that, at low trade volumes you can do what ever you want to the price.  The HODL concept actually distorts true price discovery / stability.

The real carnage (having lived thru it) was all the start ups that crashed a burned and became "ghost" VC cash vehicles for write off purposes.  The NASDAQ was only the visible metric but it was a bloody time.
Ahh the days of forgoing a decent salary and being paid in options that eventually became worthless.  So many lessons learned.

Fiduciary duty would be the primary reason.  You wouldn't want your 401k fluctuating 50% in a day.  Just not how those institutional investors work.  They have a duty enshrined within their investment prospectus to allocate in specific ways, with semi predictable returns.
Feel free to point me in a direction of any fund who is being asked by it's investors to put its money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:18:53
No institutional investor is going to put a dime into a high risk asset class (not sure bitcoin would even qualify as an asset class).  Even if you had price stability there are no dividends, there is no "growth" vector, there is no balance sheet to audit, sales to analyze.  None of those types of investors would ever come within a mile of crypto trading beyond a hedge buy, but they have other currencies to do those hedges with so....
The day you can predict with relative certainty what the price of bit coin will do, is the day it might be used as a currency hedge.  Till then, expect day traders, pump and dump manipulators and general chaos.
