Wow, didn't know there's something like that in Germany.

Wait what? you have to pay for transferring 900 $ from someone I the US to someone in the US? As a European, my mind is blown.
Seriously, what?

In Germany you don't have no bank account unless you are five or homeless. You send your money via sepa transfer, receiver gets it at a bank or ATM - for free. Probably the same in rest of Europe.

How many cans of Dr Pepper is it worth?
Additionally I'd like to know how many slices of bacon and dr pepper I could get in a 5:1 ratio (bacon:dr pepper)... You know, to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Would have guessed one of the big online ships for electronics would be first to adopt bitcoin in Germany.
