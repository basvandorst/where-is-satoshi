Nodes will only be run by big corps and selected BSV partners like Amazon, Google etc etc who have the power and storage space available. Everyone else can run what they call listener nodes to stay up to date with the network. 
These big corps already have the majority of the nodes on the network, very few regular Joes.

Miners will set their own hard caps to around 512mb, so likely will very rarely see a block bigger than that. in 2020 SV will remove the block size cap and let miners control it totally, so this time next year we could even see 100GB blocks if a miner with majority hash rate wants to do that. 
bigger blocks is a nice idea as you can fit more transactions, so when block reward is sliced in half, and half again miners will remain profitable. On the testnet, miners using 512mb were making more from trx fees than from the mining reward. But without more people transacting on SV this is a pretty pointless move.

That's very true. Hacking gets harder so scams are the only way now. But you would think that before an exchange lists a coin the project should submit paperwork such as regulation certificates or at least a quick background check. Disappointing that exchanges aren't helping people, especially for new people on the scene. Lambs to the slaughter

developers keep doing this, especially when you can play online. Rockstar did it in RDR2 and claimed it was so protect players from scammers.   
A lot of Fortnite players have been scammed after revealing they're into crypto, and the devs are looking to cut this trouble out of their games. 
It really sucks, but I guess you can try BTC? Not as good looking as Bitcoin, but better than BCASH! ;)

Honestly, if your business plan/whitepaper is to turn this WooCommerce store into the Amazon killer, you've got your work cutout. Not bashing you, just offering out some pointers as to why this isn't the Amazon killer  
Why you're not the Amazon killer:
* You're building on wordpress
* You're using WooCommerce
* you haven't enabled gzip (tells me you're not using a developer)
* you're not using browser caching (tells me you're not using a developer)
* You don't have a CDN (cloudflare is free!!)
* images aren't properly optimised
* you still have demo content on the site
* you're using a shared hosting plan. On your server alone there are 7 other websites... This isn't scalable. As soon as you hit 100 active users at the same time you will end up crashing or your hosting provider will throttle bandwidth massively, meaning your site will become slower than a turtle crawling uphill. 
Go take a look at other projects that are actually using blockchain tech like OpenBazaar or Particl. They actually use blockchain tech, their token actually has value and they look great. You've got a long way to go and should reconsider your cash spending. Stop spending 50% on marketing and pump that into platform development.   
Fix all these issues then start pushing your project. First impression is everything in this world, don't blow it with this half-baked website. Wait until your product works well, looks good and is truly scalable. Currently, at best, this project stinks of scam. Too many rookie mistakes

Just so i understand correctly, you've set up a WooCommerce store on WordPress and you're allowing people to create accounts to buy and sell items in crypto through the coinpayments.net payment gateway?   
what's so unique about this? Anyone could knock up a similar store in a matter of hours and, not to be rude, make it look a lot nicer.   
You should look at making something using blockchain technology, create a decentralized marketplace. There are some epic ones out there, and some very stylish ones about to launch. There is a lot of room for improvement, but we've all got to start somewhere. Maybe make the next step developing your own website, not using WooCommerce. 
good luck :)

You could team up with a game developer to get the provably fair poker game and you simply integrate LN payments/deposits into accounts. Bots will always be hard to keep out as bot devs will pay you to use your ID. Online poker is a dying industry because of this.

should have gone to a proper crypto casino to gamble with your crypto. Most would have matched your deposit and you would have had a way better selection of games to play than this dice game.

damn straight! save up that BTC during bear market instantly too. Got no choice or excuse not to accumulate more if you're getting paid in BTC

A lot of banks don't let their users interact with crypto exchanges, especially where I live. So for people like me, it's a major help in getting your hands on crypto. Not to mention you get the money a ton faster than waiting for the bank to process the payment

That's awesome! I would love to be able to use it as money, but so few places where i live accept crypto. Just convert what i need to pay the bills and food. The rest i buy stuff online with or hodl. Hopefully soon accepting crypto becomes the norm, especially as Visa and MasterCard have started to ramp up their fees

damn straight! great if you can't pass the KYC/AML checks

I still would. You never know what the next day has in store for you. It's painful getting paid in BTC then the next morning you wake up and suddenly it's worth 5% less. but it does go the other way too. Sometimes you can wake up and it's worth close to 10% more. Don't always come out on top, but it certainly makes monday morning a bit more exciting
