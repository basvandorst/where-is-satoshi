Okay, buddy. You do you and keep getting up on your soapbox to brag about how much money you have and its peoples fault they are poor. 
Not worth my time (you still havent actually adressed the point that a) this isnt her golden egg b) its clearly a luxury purchase none is going broke over).
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:56:58
Your missing the point - this isnt her golden egg. Let people live their life dude. This clearly isnt a choice between a new kitchen or a life of poverty hahahah
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:55:24
Okay but thats a totally random stat there. 
My point is it makes sense to liquidate a luxury asset to finance a luxury purchase vs. say your savings, or using credit.
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:08:47
You arent going broke selling a well performing asset you dont need. 
If she clearly needed the asset and capital maybe, but its clearly a luxury item.

*Designed for human pyschology in markets. So yeah Crypto still falls under this definition. 
Yes Crypto has more external moments that's really move things, but the same is true for....well any market. Look at tech stocks and Trump's trade war. 
Not a crystal ball. Not fortune telling, and never �� accurate anywhere. But also probably no more or less accurate then "one day nah shillcoins will moooooon again....wen!?!?" Or this strange, vague ass futuristic oriented hopium posts. 
Stay strong mates the Bear is real. ��

Bro you have to understand cash isnt going away. It co-exists with crypto.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:29:19
What trash logic. You're not wrong over the long term, but in 1-2 months? L-o-l.
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:56:28
Thats one long neck mate
@_date: 2019-06-13 11:47:28
This is silly and makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-06-13 11:48:10
Future bribery would use cash which is far less traceable then crypto.

Mate Assange proves we are all weak to power. His nobel whatever was lost years ago. Wikeaks very much became a biased and politicized organization. It sucks to hear. I loved them too but its true.
I dont say any of that nonsense so i dont know whay else to tell you. 
Yout "hero" got thrown out for refusing to clean up after his cat and suing the people helping hin multiple times.

Same. Thid whole thread reads of bitcoin maximalist logic without any consideration or proof of burden on establishing why the BAT token is bad. Especially when you consider interoperability of all the various eth chains, contracts and ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:20:08
Yeah, but like, you are using a system (bitcoin) where the goal of the design is transparency for all the users including how and what addresses you send your coins. So while you feel that way it doesnt really describe the most inherent nature of bitcoin and many public blockchains.

Okay so line by line...
- if i dont pay my taxes poor children starve from lack of food and healthcare provisions. As do old people. I got to jail and more people die.
- I didnt personally have the power or authority to vote for more then 3-5 of these politicians nor does any one american. So you cant reach a goverment wide conclusion. Also 50% of the time you may have voted against the candidate currently representing you. 
-i have protested and debated most od these wars. Many americans skipped the final draft in out history. Also all of what you said is true, but not something i directly create outside of thr decision to join said military. Something i bet few people on this subreddit have done. This is kinda lile saying you were complicit in mass starvation for growing up poor with no political cloute in stalinist russia. 
-(added a 4th) Yes the system is broken and creates real systemic violence and oppression. But its not the fault of an individual's behavior in that systen or society (within reason. Exceptions Example: see if you joined the military or voted for a warhawk politician)
You might have very little grounded understanding of how these things work. Try harder mate. Git gud.

Question: Why will ethereum inevitably fail scale and bitcoin wont? 
Id assume your arg comes down to PoW vs. PoS. Otherwise they are using same L2 approaches and eth actually has more options to scaling off-chain because of its ability to execute dApps compared to BTC's ability.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:46:43
Of course i have and every election since i have been eligible. The systen may be fucked beyond belief, but lack of particpation only increases the chance of a worse system. "Representatives" wont care when they feel your vote for them doesnt matter.

It was also up 400% at 14k.

Yeah youd need to start the first cart back like another 60+ years.
Fun fact, to track real CAGR for btc, you need to adjust the gains for inflation...aka it still factors into our magic internet monies.
