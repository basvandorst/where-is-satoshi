Oh Erik, you silly, simple, human. Your little rebellion won't work when my power and money slay you.

You're very welcome ~~future client~~! 
I worked tirelessly on the BitLicense, only taking big companies with deep pockets advice, so that I could come up with a complex process only my consulting firm will be able to help you with. 
Please give me a couple of weeks, and then you will be able to give me a down payment for my services, which will be an ongoing commitment. 
Thank you,
Benjamin Lawsky, extraordinaire.

**Bring it.**

There you go, now you finally get it! 
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:31:05
Your efforts are futile, simple human.

As legit as my regulations, son! 
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:25:54
It was already posted a bunch of times. A number of people in this sub pinged me about it already, you derp. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:33:02
That's the one. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:34:00
Hi Bruce, 
Thanks. You would be profoundly funny too, but only if you weren't so ignorant. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:14:51
*Lawsky, bitch. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:20:21
Thank you. Consider this the lead up to the great coup de grâce. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:07:21
Five years from now when I'm collecting all your abandoned bitcoins, taxing your virtual currencies, and regulating your pretend free worlds, I will be laughing, all the way to the BANK! 
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:56:48


I just laughed so hard, I almost choked on my food. Good luck with your 'petition'. I guess you don't know my powers, feeble human.  
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:30:12


Now you sound ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:31:42
Not to worry. I'm actively engaging NJ and CT and they should be following suit as soon as I get NY regulations finalized. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:54:32
lol you made me spit out my diet Pepsi!
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:47:37
More regulation? Ok! 
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:57:37
Ben Lawsky here. Obviously employees of NYDFS are exempt from the proposed law. Thank you for the donation. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:45:37
Ft. Meade? Ha. You need to keep climbing son and understand the powers I wield from the great state of New York. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 22:39:28
Being real isn't in my dossier. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:58:17
I'm not trying to fool anyone. It's obvious who I work for. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 13:22:37
Lawsky gotta law 
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:57:27
Not funny. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:21:03
I'll do my best to push through BitLicense before I leave office though. You can *bank* on that. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:34:27
Thank you fine citizen. No worries, all dissidents will be dealt with appropriately. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:05:01
Shrem was a key component to ensuring that bitcoins are regulated to the maximum degree possible to keep my state and my citizens protected. Get at me, bro. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:27:31
Don't tell me what to do. That's my job! 
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:39:08
heh 
@_date: 2014-07-25 14:23:35
Very good child. Inform others, or they will perish. Dissidents will not be tolerated. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:15:40
Thank you for posting this to Reddit. I'm in contact with the moderators of this sub forum and they will be supplying me with all your account info and IP address information. This information along with the post will be sufficient in submitting charges against you for evading the IRS. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:38:38
It's more like these companies asking for permission. Don't forget, we have the power, not them! Muhahaha! 
@_date: 2014-08-19 23:28:17
**Enjoy it while it lasts, folks.**
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:11:56
Will you be there too, Charles? 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:40:45
You're Welcome. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:08:33
You guys are idiots. I hope the audience at the conference aren't this dense. 
-Ben  
@_date: 2014-08-10 12:46:31
I can confirm this. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:41:19
Public comments have been made regarding the extension of the comment period. If you weren't so busy circle jerking you would know this. 
You need to brace yourselves though, **bitcoin regulation is coming.**
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-23 12:44:01
You clearly are in need of a job, because you have too much time on your hands. 
Please contact my office directly, and maybe there are some grants we can help you with. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:28:23
I don't think you understand my power, human. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:06:34
I did. How do you think I got the job I have now?? 
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:56:40
Bring the pain. But can you handle it being reciprocated, young stallion?
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:18:34
Thank you for making a list. This makes it much easier now for me to know who to target first. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 01:57:02
Lol 
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:06:58
I can confirm this. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:04:16
@_date: 2014-07-30 02:36:16
on the regulated blockchain
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:35:35
Heh 
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:48:28
Don't worry, it's being documented. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:46:46
Hey hey, he can kiss me other places too. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 02:01:51
You took the words right out of my mouth. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:19:58
I'll make you comply one way or the other, Amir. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:28:28
Pfffft... 
@_date: 2014-07-25 01:38:06
And I'm gonna castrate those balls into regulatory hell. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:04:03
I know, thank you. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:35:06
Very good guess!
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:44:08
*haters gonna hate*
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:12:36
Thanks for posting this. I was a bit nervous but feel I hit a home run guys. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-23 21:34:35
Yes, please try this! My speed dial is ready. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:46:18
No. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 02:37:39
Mr. Selkis,
Thank you for your letter. I will take your thoughts into consideration, as soon as I'm done reading these thousand other letters.
Remember, there's only 45 days to comment. Letters that bubble to the top are the ones I will review first, and will probably get the most attention. 
I'm pretty sure you can guess how you (and others like Coinbase, Circle, Bitcoin Foundation, etc.) can get their letters to bubble to the top. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:47:54
Very good, human. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:40:31
Get at me bro 
@_date: 2014-08-06 02:20:36
Get at me, Falkenridge! 
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:41:38
*Lawsky's gotta law!*
@_date: 2014-07-23 22:19:56
I believe the phrase is "more regulations, please."
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:59:33
Please learn to spell prior to including my name in any of your statements. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:05:18


And this is why we bitcoin needs regulation! Thank you. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-23 02:30:04
No, this is very serious and the good state of New York, and my office, don't take these things lightly. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:44:19
Thank you for the report. I will take it from here. Dissidents will not be tolerated. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:09:51
Don't worry. My NSA friends have already been mining for years now. I'll let you guess who you think my friends are. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 02:33:00
Your name suits you well. What do you say when you look in the mirror? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:30:51
Thank you, child. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 00:55:16
I can confirm this. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:00:22
This is another bullet for my Regulation Gun. *It's fully loaded.*
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:10:27
I know right, let's leave this Lawsky fellow alone. He's a good guy, after all. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:57:18
Haters gonna hate 
@_date: 2014-08-02 03:19:27
I can confirm this. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 01:03:27
Don't worry, the NYDFS has more good stuff coming soon. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:27:57
I can confirm this won't happen. It's a big bank for me! 
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:02:24
The person that is going to regulate your precious bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:44:34
You obviously don't know how to read. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:08:11
It's too late, regulators round up! 
@_date: 2014-07-30 02:37:26
Have your *biticon*. I'm interested in your Bitcoins, bitch. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 02:01:24
Get at me bro 
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:31:28
Don't worry, Doge is next. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:33:57
Regulators, mount up! 
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:01:33
Anything is possible. I won't ask you if you own any though, I'll just look it up in the NSA database. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:06:05
My thoughts exactly. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:26:52
Haters gonna hate. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-23 00:51:32
Thank you, we could use more rules and regs in the Bitcoin world. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:27:41


He hates you too. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:23:43
Heh, you wish. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:11:42
I must regulate this. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:39:34


*Fixed 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:49:10
*You hate us cause you anus*
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:26:56
My banking buddies said just bitcoins only, sorry. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 02:35:32
You're absurd. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 22:59:05
**I can confirm this**
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:40:37
I have the respect. I have the power. Now give me your money. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:55:52
I became a bitcoin expert in just a similar amount of time. It's only fair that my citizens experience the same. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 01:11:25
No, we do other questionable things too, but there isn't anything you can do about it. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 23:27:23
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:06:33
Don't worry, I'm here to help save bitcoin and make it succeed. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:46:35
No. The license is not required for merchants or consumers that utilize Virtual Currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:40:11
Sorry Ryan, but Lawsky gotta law. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2014-07-30 02:48:05
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:51:11
I will as soon as I'm done killing off your precious coin. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:13:54
**I can confirm this. - Ben**
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:21:28
This is a wasted effort. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:52:19
To bad your mom didn't live by those rules. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:55:41
Actually, due to the recent Bitstamp hack I'm working feverishly to regulate Bitcoin in every possible way. Regulators, round up!
-Ben 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:23:17
I'm sorry Bruce, but life, and events happen that can change the course. With the recent Bitstamp hacking, I'm revamping the license for even stronger regulation; who else is going to protect you humans from each other? Now, please stop spreading lies Bruce, before I have to release my power upon you. 
-Ben 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:50:50
You can thank me later, simple human. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:35:36
Luckily, there is no law against colleagues in *my firm* working with Bitcoin companies.
