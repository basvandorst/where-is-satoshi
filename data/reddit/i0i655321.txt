Right at very large blocks centralization would be a huge problem. But at 8 or 16 or even 32mb which was bitcoins original block size, no. We still need more solutions though 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:45:05
This is just why I own 7 different coins. Owning just bitcoin is foolish no matter what anyone says. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:39:22
Well it started off as a bitcoin subreddit. The actual bitcoin community is what has become divided. Think like the US north and south during the civil war. We need to come back together to be at full strength.

I think that talking about "realness" is so misguided no matter who it is. The conversation should focus on technical points

Market cap = number of shares(or in our case bitcoins) X value per coin. 
Volume refers to the number of shares traded on a given day. 
When a trade is made it is displayed on the screen at the price it was made at. So when you see the price of bitcoin is at 13000 you are seeing that the last trade took place at 13000. A crypto with no trade taking place would have a volume of 0 so its price would be 0 because the value the last transaction took place at was nothing or 0.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:25:12
Well how come ethereum process more transactions then bitcoin for next to nothing? Don't high fees go to miners anyways?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:28:36
Then no one is to blame. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:16:31
Well my family didn’t even ask about it so what does that tell you? 
Anyways, get on bitcoin beginners at least every once and a while. Answering some questions on there is basically charity. Some people on there literally have no concept of investing. One 15yr old kids question was that “if he bought bitcoin at 8k and it went to 10k, did that mean he could already sell it and make money?” 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:43:14
Can  you sell crypto for fiat on Gemini?

@_date: 2017-12-11 12:51:04
True. I’m baffled by the total lack of any financial know how in this space.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:45:35
That’s exactly what I’m getting at. Our 200k unconfirmed txt are all just from people who are at the cash in/out desks. We haven’t even started going around to tables yet because those would be the coffee purchases and stores we spend coins at once LN is working.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:56:56
Same eth does have bigger blocks though. And Ltc has a faster block time. Still that  just proves that big blocks alone are only part of the solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:06:34
Dude do not let everyone know who that person is. They will get fucked so hard with requests for money

Yeah he has been bad so he got a short walk.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:16:59
Yes the feud is simple. Bitcoin core is conservative and make few changes to bitcoin. As it stands now bitcoin can only handle 3-10 transactions per second.  As a result when more than 3-10 want to use bitcoin each second these people decide who goes first by biding on the next spot by paying a fee. As of right now about a 5-6 dollar fee will get your transactions through pretty quick. However I myself have had to pay a 45 dollar fee on one instance where I really needed my transaction to be timely during a high volume time. Sometimes you just can’t wait. Other coins including ethereum have greatly help to alleviate this problem in the short term by increasing block size. This is not a permanent solution but it has been shown to work on ethereum which currently handles about 700k daily transactions compared to bitcoins 400k. The fee for an ethereum transaction has been about 2-3 cents in my experience.  Even less with bitcoin cash. 
To further exacerbate the problem, bitcoins block size was 32mb when it was first created as opposed to 1mb right now. (Bitcoin cash is 8mb and ethereums constantly adjust based on demand) In November bitcoin was supposed to increase block size to 2mb but the plan fell apparat. This is what led to a good deal of big blockers moving to bitcoin cash because the 2mb plan was seen as progress and those people where still will to give bitcoin a chance, but couldn’t stand staying one with a coin that has been failing to progress technically. 
As it stands today bitcoin seems to be all in on lightning network solving the issue of fees and make blocksize debate less relevant. I personally don’t understand why they couldn’t manage to increase functionality while other teams seem to have done so with little effort. Because of this I have decided To own bitcoin because it is very popular and lightning seems to be making progress after years of nothing, I own ethereum because it seems to be more robust and offer service well beyond just the monetary because of the inclusion of the ethereum Virtual machine on the ethereum Blockchain and I own bitcoin cash because they seem to be making progress in a different direction. Additionally I hold some litecoin because they are helping to develop the lightning network. My only goal is to have a horse in each race and want to own a winner. 
Additionally there are some ideological/philosophical reasons for wanting low fees. The main one is that those 3 billion people living on less than 5$ a day would have there quality of life improved my a currency with very low fees because it would allow them to open a bank account with nothing more than a old old Nokia cell phone, send money to family, have savings and participate in the global economy.

Well Segwit was supposed to be optional so who is to blame for that?

@_date: 2017-12-12 01:30:32
Hey at least it’s getting used 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:17:24
We just have to do our best to counteract that in a calm manner when we see an opportunity to do so. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:25:31
Yeah I wish we could stop the spamming. This community could be so much more than it is now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:16:08
What I am really try to get at was that most people including myself didn’t care much for BCH until segwit2x failed. I understand that segwit was still implemented and know it provided some relief. 
I hear about this or that thing, I I feel that I know a good deal and have an at least algebraic understanding of coin mechanics. But since I have to real technical background or way of really knowing the truth I am left only able to make judgments with the barest facts. Because I can see # daily transactions of my coins and the fee I can see what results different strategies have produced. Not everyone is using the same strategy, but I can see results and can’t really talk myself out of dumping lit ecoin, ethe reum, bitcoin or bitcoin csh at this time.

It was but coinbase halted trading because they knew that was too high and didn't want the legal trouble

Wait I thought core was actually the correct term? Like core devs cause it sounds more official then just devs. Or do you just mean because he was using it in a bad way?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:46:07
He didn’t even say what other coins. Can you really sit there and tell me ethereum has nothing to offer. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:56:56
This basically means that because so much business is conducted in dollars, one of the biggest concerns of a currency trader is how a currency is weighed against the dollar. That’s why the bitcoin is always measured in dollars 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:54:13
There are a handful of currencies business is conducted in. The dollar is the biggest. That’s why. [here ](

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:54:47
Technically both coins are different from the original bitcoin. They do have some great points tho. Who cares which is the " original" when at the end of the day the market only cares who solves scaling first?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:11:11
It can't be explained. There is no reason not to implement solutions proven to work. To those who point to bcash' s low transaction volume, please explain why ethereum, which has a higher transaction volume than bitcoin, has low fees and is close to instant. Could it be the bigger blocks on the ethereum network? Makes sense to me
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:49:28
Ok thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:38:30
Well don't both coins have the same ideology, they just accuse the other as not. My understranig is that both groups want a low to zero fee coin, that is decentralized, with a limited supply, run on a blockchain, available to everyone even those living on less than a dollar a day, that has instant and immutable transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:05
You didn’t have a savings account until you turned 18?!?!?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:50:48
All that really matters is how many people you get using it. That’s why we are so political here. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:25:24
I agree. I do still own a bit of that coin though because there seems to be some large orginizatioons fighting on that side of the line. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:36:19
So basically what your saying is that an exchange like coinbase would open a channel let’s say 1 time per day for a large amount of people, the number doesn’t matter but I’m sure it would be large, and then at then end of the day they would settle everything on chain with one transaction? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:06
Just read opposing opinions and form your own
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:08:18
I thought no one could withdraw iota for usd right now 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:06:18
I like where your heads at
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:30:08
Is the trade you made really be someone else's fault though?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:55:32
None of those transactions are even purchases so would all have to be settled on chain. LN wouldn’t help this situation.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:26:03
I quite frankly like bigger blocks but really don't like this guy. He is literally a stain on crypto as a whole. When he was a martyr for bitcoin back when no one cares that might have been good enough for this community, fine, but not any more 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:44
So someone is spending over 5 million dollars a day on spam transactions? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:07:15
That's what I thought until I found out ethereum process more transaction then bitcoin. It is instant and has about 30 cent fee so idk
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:52:07
Tell them they can eat sh!t until they find my btc
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:23:52
Perhaps. I wouldn't bet against computer hardware just becoming insaillnly powerful. There is a chance that file storage will move to DNA in the next 15 years which would basicly allow for unlimited storage. 
I do believe that ethereum runs on an algorithm that adjust block size based off second to second demand, which I would love to see implemented elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:37:56
You really just shouldn’t sell all of something. Especially when he got in at such a good price point.

Perhas, but perhaps not. The human genome cost 100 mill to decode in 2001, you can now have your genome read for 100$. This is reading not writing though. Still I believe there is a lot of motivation for process there and this is only one of I assume Manny technologies to [improve] ( file  storage.

Dude this isn’t even bitcoin related 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:48:05
Shoot I didnt know that you got a paper wallet! That's pretty cool and easy. 
I guess I just assumed it was easy for people to set up accounts on coinbase or whatever because it's pretty similar to how accounts are set up on a stock exchange. I have set up so many of those it seems easy to me. But now that I think back when I set up my fidelity account it was pretty hard. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:58:57
You could just lie and say your 18. Or you could buy a coin that is not considered an investment on an exchange like bittrex. Research ethereum and learn the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

And while Blockchain can do a lot for capitalism, it can also do a lot for cronies as well. By the time I’m an old man everyone’s identity will likely be stored on a government block chain. Imagine what the NSA could do with that.
