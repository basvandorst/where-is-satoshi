Why not?  How do you know?  
@_date: 2015-06-03 10:51:18
Good presentation, and accurate.
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:53:21
Useless?  Have you seen the money people are throwing at him for it?  Art is not useless.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:10:30
That's what she said.
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:37:20
You're allowed to say "shit" here.  We won't yell at you, I promise.
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:08:33
Holy shit.  I could call myself an early adopter if I never lost my wallet that had barely over a single bitcoin in it, but not even that scratches this.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:13:24
That's a hell of a drug.
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:48:20
Except the part where yes it is.
@_date: 2014-12-15 05:15:42
Totally, but making them actually think about what I'm saying, and say what I mean objectively is so hard.  I work on my speech every single day, and no matter how concise and verbose I can be, people can simply out me for it with less effort.  It seems like some people don't even have to try to make me look like some kind of asshole for actually considering something so taboo.
@_date: 2014-08-17 01:51:00
Not THAT quietly apparently.
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:56:17
I think the word they're going for is "ability."
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:17:54
Censor your mother.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:06:04
I'm on 4.  Is that established enough?  Have you seen the size of my subreddit?  *unzips*
Oh, dat compression though.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:15:57
I wish I knew a good way to tell a lot of people about both....
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:24:10
Here's some random thing I found on the internet.  Have at it:  
It's hilarious because it has concise and verbose as opposites as well.  I'm probably wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-15 05:49:05
How do I spread curiosity?
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:11:37
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:45:55
Yeah sure, but those definitions don't have the perspective of a software developer where the term has much more interesting implications.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:14:40
I could click on an ad like 20 times, but they just think I'm gaming it.  What if I could just give Etho like $20 for making all those videos I fucking love?  It's not like he just does it to spread around how awesome he is.
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:15:02
OP, I want to see you deliver now!
@_date: 2014-12-15 05:48:19
They're not opposites.  People say verbose means wordy, but what it really means is that what you're saying only has 1 possible interpretation.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:24:40
What's the problem here?  Karma whores are probably the most deserving.
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:35:46
Yeah, these issues are why I'm asking. Resist sync also fails to search subs with an underscore in the name.
Does Reddit now have moderator tools? I made but I've really had nothing to do with it for a long time.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:11:04
What about the other days of the week?
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:25:35
The Bar on Buena makes the only Bob Burger I want!
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:14:05
How would you compare Reddit now with Reddit sync?
@_date: 2014-11-22 18:55:19
What does it mean?
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:09:15
The gravy train has no brakes.  I've always wanted to try trainwreck!  I heard it's the good stuff.
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:10:25
Bots and reposters sorta suck, but sorta don't at the same time.
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:14:03
I can just imagine trying to file taxes and describe where it came from.


Boom, audit.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:37:51
The answer is "because that shit is fucking hilarious."
@_date: 2016-06-08 23:07:18
Great.  So now when I use incognito mode to look at porn, I'm subject to raids.
Can we fight them yet?
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:48:31
I had a bitcoin once, but now it's lost forever. :(
@_date: 2015-07-02 09:34:59
What's different about the experience?
@_date: 2011-01-14 08:53:34
You sir, have figured it out.
@_date: 2016-05-01 09:06:14
@_date: 2016-05-01 03:19:10
What sorts of games would this really suit?
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:50:13
You said people would think about bidding higher than what the actual price is.  They NEVER would because bidding higher means you lose.


The answer is no.  Don't ever bid higher than what you think the price is because that's completely stupid.
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:49:49
X-post to I totally want to meet this guy. He's probably awesome.
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:27:53
That is some crazy tinfoil hat shit. "What is this sorcery" is a very common phrase on Reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:06:41
I had a bitcoin once...
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:39:58
Idk about China.  I'm pretty sure China is pretty heavy handed about regulation.
I'm not really sure about this, so feel free to tell me why I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:46:40
Yes, it's a perfect strategy, but fuck.  It makes it so going first means you're just insta-fucked.  I don't hate the players.  Just the game.  It needs to be blind pick yo.
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:29:24
Protip: if you see someone doing this, just don't tip them. You have zero obligation to.
@_date: 2013-06-15 09:53:29
That's the best goddamn Willy Wonka shit ever.
@_date: 2013-08-21 09:12:18
It's generally a good thing to try to figure out what's wrong with something.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:26:56
Wat.  No, I mean the people who bid just $1 over the person before them.  That completely fucks that other person because they now have to be exactly right.
@_date: 2013-08-20 19:44:45
It could.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:02:19
No.  That's not how the game works at all.  If you bid over, you lose.  Even if you're just $1 over, and you're the closest to the price, you lose.  End of game.
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:16:55
The bot should have a link to an explanation.
@_date: 2013-05-31 23:58:22
It's really bugging the shit out of me, and I think they did it on purpose.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:17:28
This thread is so depressing.  It sucks because it's true.
@_date: 2013-08-20 07:58:57
Sure they have the power to, but why? What's the threat?
@_date: 2013-08-19 08:05:25
How could the government come up with an excuse to regulate bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:35:15
He is praising bitcoin users for being awesome ok?
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:41:31
You're nuts.
@_date: 2013-07-30 06:08:37
How did they know about it?
@_date: 2013-08-20 07:59:25
You know what else is? Every other kind of money.
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:26:48
So it's pretty much a bot that manages a bunch of wallets? That is super neat.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:07:32
I always hate seeing that asshole on The Price is Right.
@_date: 2013-06-20 03:53:01
What is this sorcery?
