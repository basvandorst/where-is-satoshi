yeah I wish there was a version that had the ability to clone a smart card of your choosing. Ive looked into it and the size and power issues make it unsuitable for NFC at this time.

I just have one question. what is DAO
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:26:36
edison did so many shitty things it's easy to believe he did one more, and one more, etc. like screwing tesla out of tens of thousands of dollars of pay, pirating movies of competing movie studios so they would go bankrupt...
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:08:00
I think investments that didn't pan out. he was rich in his mid 30's

over a million dollars seems not only reasonable, but extremely cheap for contract work. tesla should have charged triple. Westinghouse paid Tesla $60,000 to license his patents. plus 2,000 a month salary, and $2.50 cents a horsepower of capacity sold. from what I was able to find westinghouse paid tesla hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. later on they paid a lump sum of $216,000 for those patents.

 I didnt score mine hard enough

Wow that looks like a really nice edge for a hacksaw. nice job! I should be getting my laser cutter in just over a month so i can't wait to cut that shit easier

I'd say more like 15-20. about what I'd give a goldmansachs exec

How did you cut your plexi? laser? I just did a very very similar looking setup (even used the same black plastic stand offs and screws) for a raspberry pi 3 wifi sniffer and i scored and flexed it and it looks like crap.

ok I had a bear of a time getting that working on windows but I think it's chugging away. I'm going to send some test bitcoins from a faucet to see if it's working

i'm not exactly familiar with it. I've seen those api's before in bitcoin-qt's debug console. 
so you're saying that with "bitcoind --walletnotify=" and then some way to assign the output of getbalance to a variable and then "sendtoaddress" insert bitcoin address here followed by that variable?
i'm not sure if i understand that
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:34:26
so I would change
    def UpdateJobStatus(cur, kid):
    	cur.execute("select balance from users where id=%s;", kid)
    	balance, = cur.fetchone()
    	cur.execute("select id,fee from jobs where uid=%s and status&lt;3 order by status desc,id desc;", kid)
    	if cur.rowcount &gt; 0:
    		jobs = cur.fetchall()
    		for job in jobs:
    			jid,fee = job
    			if fee*1e3 &lt;= balance:
    				balance -= fee*1e3
    				cur.execute("update jobs set status=1 where id=%s and status=0;", jid)
    
    def UpdateJobStatus(cur, kid):
        	cur.execute("select balance from users where id=%s;", kid)
        	balance, = cur.fetchone()
        	cur.execute("select id,fee from jobs where uid=%s and status&lt;3 order by status desc,id desc;", kid)
        	if cur.rowcount &gt; 0:
        		jobs = cur.fetchall()
        		for job in jobs:
        			jid,fee = job
        			if fee*1e3 &lt;= balance:
        				balance -= fee*1e3
                        postdata = json.dumps({"method": 'sendtoaddress', 'params': ["insertmybitcoinaddress", balance], 'id':'jsonrpc'})
        				cur.execute("update jobs set status=1 where id=%s and status=0;", jid)

I'm programming jalapenos and little singles for people for $25. I have the programmer and I even compile from source because I have 2 jalapenos that each require slightly different settings to get maximum performance.

can someone post a transcription? i cant see it with all the jpeg. i think i made out "your account is associated with coinbase" and that's all i can make out
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:43:12
I've never used bitcoind can it open my bitcoin-qt wallet or will i have to export it to that json format or something similar?
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:50:17
does myprogram have to be in python? it seems that's what every single bitcoin script i've seen is written in.
i'm not exactly clear what a txid is despite reading the api
is there a way to setup an interrupt on stdin or would I have to poll it?
either way then it seems something like
    import sys
    data = sys.stdin.readlines()
    for len(data)
        somehowgetbalance
        somehowsendtoaddress balance
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:01:35
ok i'm new to python but i've taken a look at the code. so i install and steup a username and password for bitcoind which runs as a server on local host.
fill in username/pass with coinwatch, poll defaults to 60 seconds. checks max blocks vs last checked block, runs Check4Pmts if new blocks contain deposits for my wallets. 
 
im a little fuzzy about here on out with UpdateJobStatus and how i would trigger a send to x address

in case you doubt me here is my tutorial on how to flash it yourself 
and you can check my profile history here on reddit to see that I have done some pcb design work in cash4bitcoin sub
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:57:29
i just signed up there yesterday, but haven't looked around yet. I'll go check it out.
by developers subreddit do you mean bitcoin specific?
