Not at all. 
If you decide to invest (only you can make that decision), buy X amount of BTC and keep in a "savings" address(es). Then buy Y amount of BTC for purchases and rebuy immediately after spending. With Coinbase, it's incredibly easy and simple. This way, you only ever have X BTC as a static liability.

Surely if you're going to blame all the world problems on corporations, there is some hypothetical alternative you'd like to see in place, however unlikely the implementation.
My point is that in the absence of Nike and its "child labor camps", these children would likely have no other way to bring home income, excepting sex slavery. And not bringing home income is not an option. Child labor is a reality in these regions, and wishing it away won't solve anything. Barring Nike from the third world would ironically hurt destitute families, not help them.

Bitcoin has been in Russia since inception. It's not going anywhere. It doesn't matter what the state says is legal or otherwise. The Russians are no stranger to circumventing the system - they've been doing it forever and during the USSR, circumvention was the only way to feed your family.

Hyperbole on my part. Apologies.


And I agreed with much of that premise, explicitly calling out the "Nike factories" argument: 


  


I've heard of these so-called insanely poor conditions, but I've never been able to find reputable sources documenting just how bad it is, and I'm afraid hyperbole may have gotten us once again. In any case, I wasn't arguing that Nike is the philanthropist of the century; I believe the opposite in fact. But context of third world economies is vital to grasping the full picture.
And here's where the finer points of the premise begin to break down in a spectacular way: Nike is hardly competing for labor resources in these markets as they're a monopsony (because of their government-granted monopoly status in the West). A market with many more players would force employers to actively compete for the best workers, in which case we are likely to see a more equitable distribution of employee welfare. Almost certainly not first world welfare, but even labor markets have formulaic supply and demand curves (given a sufficient sample size).

The fact that you and others have been convinced of this is sickening.
How can keeping your own wealth be theft? This backwards logic is nonsense.
Since governments first started taxing (read: beginning of civilization), tax resistance, protest, and noncompliance have been par for the course. Sometimes as a general moral protest and sometimes as civil disobedience for specific political goals. Mohandas Gandhi in the Salt March, the Women's Tax Resistance League during the female suffrage rights era, nonviolent resistance against war time and time again, Roman Zealots against the poll tax, the tax revolts leading to the signing of the Magna Carta and of course the American and French Revolutions. John Adams, Thoreau, W.L. Garrison, Woolman, Marx, Julia Hill - the list goes on.
A book that might just be worth your while is Cambridge's [*Economic Psychology of Tax Behaviour*](


So I ask you, who are the "we" that "like tax"? It can hardly be said society is "we", as it is clear from the above that tax resistance has long been a feature of society.
I know you haven't explicitly made this point, but I'll address it anyway. The argument that taxes are simply dues paid to society because no one individual can create wealth without it is also nonsense. An excellent analogy once presented to me:


-- Анка-Пулемётчица
***TL;DR Taxation is theft, pure and simple. Telling someone to leave because they have moral issues with taxes is just misguided leftism. Since time immemorable, tax non-compliance has been a powerful nonviolent medium for dynamic and radical social change. It's worked before, and it's not going anywhere. Deal.***

Interesting survey, though as you said, hardly conclusive.
Though it may seem superficially as if libertarianism indeed qualifies as some kind of socio-economic Darwinism (in the social context, not the actual evolutionary context), and it may even mean that for some of its advocates, when you learn more and your philosophical understanding deepens you realize it can hardly be classified in this way. A lot of this interpretation comes from a poorly-conceived but very "mainstream" perspective of capitalism that views it as predatory and zero-sum.

Honestly, you would have to look through historical charts and even then, it's pretty damn difficult to predict the future for anything, much less a relatively new currency. It depends on too many things, namely:
* adoption rates
* volatility of exchange rates
* rate of losses, like people losing keys
* consumer confidence in BTC
* investor confidence in BTC
* mining block rates (which is probably the most predictable, but as we've seen with the adoption of ASICs, even this is not predictable long-term)
* confidence and success/failures of fiat currency
* rise or adoption of competing decentralized currencies
* price of gold, silver, and other bullion
* a million other factors
Like anything worth doing, Bitcoin is a complicated beast. Sorry I don't have more time for your post, but I think a good summary is that it's likely any even well-informed prediction will be wrong in six months.

* Mandatory 2-factor authentication.
* Reusing the same singular bitcoin address is a really bad practice. Where does change go? Make it a more extensive wallet with administrative options through email and SMS.
* Buy an SMS short code (4-5 digits) instead of a full 10+ digits. If 6 digits are allowed for short codes, try to get 729538 (PAYJET).
Other than that, this works great for anonymity (assuming the reuse feature is fixed), as a user can make throwaway emails, fund it with Payjet, buy something, then forget about the email.

No problem.
Anarcho-capitalism advocates the greatest extent possible of social and economic freedom. Its proponents claim anarchy is good (or at least morally superior), and that the likely utilitarian outcome of true working anarchy is free market capitalism.
Communism advocates the greatest extent possible of social freedom, but claims extreme economic freedom *as perceived by capitalists* is inherently wrong. Its proponents also believe anarchy to be morally good or objectively desirable, and that the likely utilitarian outcome of true anarchy is worker-owned and -run cooperatives.

Bitfloor (an exchange) does ACH, wires, as well as free CapitalOne360 P2P transfers. BitInstant takes cash deposits. ZigGap accepts MoneyGram, Western Union, and cash deposits.
The options are there. MtGox is one of my least favorite ways to get into it.

Who knows what the political landscape will look like by that time? Bitcoin is a pretty well-organized community right now, but that's because it's the same like-minded people crossing paths in their daily life to discover it. It's still a fledgling despite its growth potential - nerds, libertarians, anarcho-capitalists, left anarchists, financial mavericks, and some economists dominate the Bitcoin demographic. If it succeeds as a currency (i.e. becomes a serious political issue, either for or against), Bitcoin will not be able to hide from the spotlight. The full economic force of the world will be pulling on it from all directions, the ultimate strain/stress test. 
The US, Three Chinas, EU, Russia, Japan, OPEC, the UN, the IMF, the Swiss, Wall Street, emerging markets in the developing world, megacorporations, competing novel currencies, entrepreneurs (see smart property), hackers, black markets, the gold market. These are just some of the many actors who would be playing tug-of-war with Bitcoin simultaneously. You can see why I am not 100% all in. I want Bitcoin to succeed more than anything, but there are still a lot of unknowns with such a grand experiment. Cautious optimism, as they say.
If we get to the stage where the Bitcoin protocol needs to be adjusted, even in such a small way like an increase in resolution, the currency will also be at large in the global economy. What will your typical miner look like then? To what degree and in what direction will governments have attempted to seize control, and how will that have altered society?
Of most importance, could we still get a majority consensus on *anything* when such a great number of players will have stakes?

How is money a social construct? Sure, you could argue it's implementation may be a construct, but fundamentally it represents ownership and transfer of value.
Let's say we both lived on an island, and our entire economy consisted of being able to collect 10 coconuts each per day. Now if you thought about it and decided to forgo one day's coconuts to build a coconut collection contraption (C^3 ) that allows you to get 30 coconuts per day, you would lose out on 10 coconuts one day but make up for it very quickly. Now I can still only get 10 coconuts per day. You are immensely richer than I, because you have greater leisure time and time to create more capital equipment and consumer goods for yourself. Our total economy is also 3 times it's former size.
This isn't a social construct. It's a tool to represent the real value created in an economy.

Correct. A change to the protocol would be required to divide further than satoshis.

Honest question - what is he trying to say here?


I think most people on this sub are familiar with the many issues of credit cards and PayPal. Bitcoin offers some very clear solutions to the numerous problems inherent to existing online payment systems, like identity theft, unnecessary sharing of personal information, chargebacks, regional blackouts, political censorship, high fees, arbitrary and unnecessary rules, and significant clearing delays.


Or it's like handing over a five-dollar bill to a cashier at your local Starbucks in the middle of the day. Tomato tomahto, apparently. Painting a frightening picture of shady back-alley drug deals really doesn't befit a supposedly esteemed economist, but I digress. This is FUD, pure and simple. Yes, the black market has found great utility in Bitcoin, but this doesn't take from its white market potential in the slightest. And calling illegal trade Bitcoin's main use may have been correct several months ago, but I don't think we can be so sure now. Sites like BitcoinStore, BitSpend, BitcoinRunner, and Bitcoinin have exploded in recent weeks, and done so despite the currency's "speculative downfall".
And let's not put blinders on when it comes to illegal trade. Alongside more nefarious dealings like recreational drugs and child pornography, black markets can enable movement and access to essential goods and services in otherwise restrictive or oppressive governments. For example, due to extensive capital controls in politically corrupt Argentina, an exchange has thrived involving the trade of bitcoins for black market pesos (which are legally set below market price).


Bitcoin as a currency is inseparable from Bitcoin as a globally secured payment and funds transfer system, and this is where it has tremendous value. From this perspective, the purchase of currency-Bitcoin can be seen as simply a barrier to entry.


Despite the name, mining is not primarily for adding to the coinbase. It is the auditing process that prevents double-spends and secures the network against attack. Just a clarification.

I more than welcome people of any political philosophy to join us with Bitcoin for a number of reasons. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be factually and historically accurate.
Bitcoin's roots can be found in the cypherpunk and crypto-anarchist movements enshrined in the Cryptography Mailing List. Nakamoto was very clear about his political motivations. The genesis block timestamp itself contains a headline alluding to the fight against central banks:


You need go no further than the Cryptography Mailing List archives to understand how Satoshi's words and deeds were marked with political intent.

It's called [synecdoche]( a type of metaphor where a term or phrase describing a part - "printing money" - is used to refer to the whole - "money creation". While the physical minting of fiat bills and coins has an infinitesimal effect on inflation and wealth concentration than does the Fed's bank funds multiplier, they both illustrate money creation. And because a video of loanable funds being manipulated digitally is hardly interesting or unambiguous, the artist used bill printing to paint a more accessible picture.

were criminal and what their punishments should be? The answer is that systems of law would be produced for profit
on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of
law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars.


advance on which court they will use in case of conflict. Thus the laws under which a particular case is decided are
determined implicitly by advance agreement between the protection agencies whose customers are involved. In
principle, there could be a different court and a different set of laws for every pair of protection agencies. In practice,
many agencies would probably find it convenient to patronize the same courts, and many courts might find it
convenient to adopt identical, or nearly identical, systems of law in order to simplify matters for their customers.


society the law under which you are judged depends on the country, state, and even city in which you happen to be.
Under the arrangements I am describing, it depends instead on your protective agency and the agency of the person
you accuse of a crime or who accuses you of a crime.


disputes. Its success depends on its reputation for honesty, reliability, and promptness and on the desirability to
potential customers of the particular set of laws it judges by. The immediate customers are protection agencies. But the
protection agency is itself selling a product to its customers. Part of that product is the legal system, or systems, of the
courts it patronizes and under which its customers will consequently be judged. Each protection agency will try to
patronize those courts under whose legal system its customers would like to live.

Bitcoins deflate, meaning the money supply is either fixed or decreasing (some coins will be lost over the years as people lose their keys, etc.) and prices tend to fall over time. You and anyone else are perfectly capable of keeping your bitcoins stashed away for the next millenia - I certainly won't stop you. But an economy functions fundamentally because people want things, whether the basis of the economy is inflationary or deflationary. Most people (read: all) will spend their money at some point because they have needs and desires, i.e. they're human.
Inflationary currencies, among other things, reward and encourage spending. Deflationary currencies reward and encourage saving. But the opposite is possible and *done every single day* in both scenarios. 
People who would like to save their money with inflationary currencies like the dollar or euro will simply transfer their wealth to deflationary assets like gold, silver, land, and even Bitcoin, or invest in riskier stocks or other investment vehicles with a high estimated rate of return.
Gold has been used as a currency far longer than any other currency in existence, and those economies somehow managed to avoid the death throes of deflationary spiral. (Read: the argument is nonsensical.)


This is not only very possible, but again happens every single day. Economists like to describe things in somewhat complicated terms, but nobody has to think like they describe. Not in the heady, proto-scientific way that they describe things. 
Did you realize the last time you bought peanut butter, you were involved in a deep analysis with respect to consumer choice theory? That, of course, you saw Jiffy and pondered its price, making necessary assumptions like complete, reflexive, transitive, non-satiative, quantity-indifferent prices? That you mulled thoughtfully over the labor-leisure tradeoff and penciled in your notebook some quick calculations on the price effect as the sum of substitution and income effects?
Economists describe things this way to be able to examine and discuss the way economies work in a common language. You may not realize it, but all that jargon actually did come into play while you were purchasing that peanut butter. 
You seem to have come into this thread with an agenda, and nothing I say here may help you with that. If you are honestly curious about Bitcoin or even just deflationary economics, let's talk. But if you have already decided Bitcoin is a scam/Ponzi scheme/pyramid/insert-unintelligible-claim-here, you probably won't get much help from anybody.

I get your point, but it's important to note that Bitcoin has more than just exchange "value".
* It's bundled with and inseparable from a **method of payment**, similar to ACH/SEPA transfers, PayPal, or Amazon Payments.
* It can be used (quasi-)uniquely with [smart property]( and similar ideas, so it can also be a form of **contract enforcement**.
* It can be used to timestamp irrevocably, so it can be considered as a **proof of credentials** or a **decentralized authenticator**.
* It can be used as a **peer-to-peer zero-trust assurance contractor** to prevent the free-rider problem.
I don't subscribe to any objective theory of value, so a lot of this is moot. If people value it, it is valued. QED. But for those that disagree, the above serves as an incomplete list of non-exchange values Bitcoin maintains.

To some degree, 3D printing and the distributed web movement are also transferring that power back to individuals; the internet itself is the backbone of this progression. Bitcoin's just another fascinating slice of the pie, albeit one that comes at a very good time (for the global economy and the resurgence of individualist ideologies).
In so many ways, Bitcoin could be just the first wave in a great tide of these 'sovereign technologies'. We are living in some seriously exciting times.

This is kinda beautiful. Telling them you'll buy it back, lower than the market price, sends them a mental cue that they are being cheated out of something's true worth.

I'm not willing to disclose enough information to figure out my exact income. But let's say you make exactly $100,000 a year.
If you are in the US for more than 35 days a year, you do not qualify for any exclusions and your net tax liability to the IRS (without taking into consideration your tax liability to other countries) would be $28,000.
If you stay out of the US for 365 days this year and meet some other rather strenuous qualifications (along with an obscene amount of paperwork), you will qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. Your net tax liability would be $8,000. This does not seem like a lot compared to the other scenario, but remember that this does not include any other tax obligations you have to other countries, like the ones you reside and/or work in. It also doesn't take into account the fact that as a long term expat, you will likely never see any benefit from either SS or Medicare.
Now imagine a scenario where you make $200,000 a year. A resident would pay $62,000. An expat would pay $40,000. 
For doing nothing other than having an US citizenship.

The data type time_t, used on operating systems such as Unix, is a 32-bit signed integer counting the number of seconds since the start of the Unix epoch (midnight UTC of 1 January 1970).[9] The latest time that can be represented this way is 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038 (corresponding to 2,147,483,647 seconds since the start of the epoch), so that systems using a 32-bit time_t type are susceptible to the Year 2038 problem.[10]

I understand, but Congress' [FATCA]( in 2010 requires all foreign banks to report US account holders' banking info to the IRS. Of course, the US has no jurisdiction overseas (if only they realized that) but they get around this by hefty taxation on offending companies' US assets. If HSBC-HK refused to give up US information, and the IRS discovered the noncompliance, HSBC-US would suffer a substantial financial shortfall.

Your patronizing tone is eye-opening. It's clear you consider yourself elitist, but not everybody shares your condescension of the average person.

Market cap is a finance term meaning the total stock quantity in circulation (or otherwise outstanding) multiplied by the stock's value in whatever currency. Bitcoiners use this term to reflect total number of mined bitcoins times the exchange rate, simply because it's a convenient term that aptly fits (even though Bitcoin isn't a stock). It gives you an idea of the total wealth currently in the system. 
In the case of stocks, Google's share price times number of shares outstanding tells you that the open market currently values the company at such-and-such dollars. So right now all existing bitcoins are worth 1.5 billion US dollars.
A 14-day moving average works like this. Take any given day's exchange rate and sum it with exchange rates on the previous 7 days and the next 6 days, then divide by 14. Do this for each day and chart it. Because it's an average of a 2 week period, the idea is to smooth out any massive short-term spikes or dips.
Say on the 50th day of the year, the price jumped to $100 dollars. But it was a one-day fluke in price, because the previous 7 days the price was $50, ands the next 6 days the price was $55. So while Day 50's absolute value was $100, the 14-day average value was actually:
D50^avg = (50+50+50+50+50+50+50+100+55+55+55+55+55+55)/14 = $55.71
In April, Bitcoin reached its highest ever valuation because the exchange rate hit $250 for one or two days. But when you average that peak with the surrounding 14 days, those relatively lower prices bring that day's price down on paper. 
End of class. Any questions?

Assuming proper address generation, this will not happen. Ever. Many people don't understand math enough to understand the absolute magnitude of the Bitcoin keyspace. When mathematicians say "very large" because it is indeed not infinite, it's easy to jump to the idea of address collisions. The fact is, the keyspace is practically speaking closer to infinity than it is to zero.

You're asking for the answer that doesn't exist. Society is a term of convenience, an abstraction that attempts to sum the aggregate of all individuals within it. Nobody can say if or when Bitcoin will become a reserve currency, because nobody knows. Individuals can decide to price goods and services in it, and that's about it. If/when enough of them do, we'll start to approach international currency status. If/when either Bitcoin outperforms the dollar or the dollar falls out of favor as world reserve status, Bitcoin (or another currency, be it fiat, crypto, or something else) will be poised to fill its place. 
There is no official document saying "USD is hereafter world reserve currency". It has achieved this status for a variety of interconnected reasons - world superpower, petrodollar, history of trust and confidence, political games, etc. Put another way, USD is WRC *de facto*, not *de jure*.

The link is for expected versus actual rewards on a particular mining pool. While the chances of discovery of the appropriate nonce (random number) and the associated block hash are essentially random, miners with greater processing power stand a better chance of finding the next block. The Bitcoin protocol is designed to distribute power (minting and ledger additions) in a decentralized way and the best compromise for appropriating "voting" power was determined to be through processing power.
So the mining pool in question can use some basic probability to figure their expected return based on their current processing power percentage (PP^poolX / PP^totalNetwork ). But there are more variables involved, so it can only ever be a good estimate.

Subtracting this from a [standard statistical bell curve]( we see quite a telling [outcome curve](
This means that PayPal, Stripe, and Google average transaction sizes are each 0% higher than Bitcoin, leading to the obvious conclusion that Bitcoin will cause a 19.7% annual rise (adjusted for population growth) in terrorism, pedophilia, and drug use as adoption increases by 1%. This of course assumes terrorism, pedophilia, and drug use are weighted at 17:5:9, respectively.

I was referring to paper bitcoin tips. You could easily keep the private address of the tip in your wallet and wait for them to claim it by sending to another address. If they don't do so after a few weeks, you can just move that back into your main wallet (or more accurately, send to another of your addresses). For small amounts, this should be trivial, especially considering you're the one who intended them to have it.
For the tipbot, this is a built-in feature. The tipbot "sends" the bitcoins to the username's wallet (creating one if it doesn't already exist) and sends them a PM. They have to claim all tips within 30 (?) days or it goes back to the original user's wallet. AFAIK, bitcointip doesn't use the blockchain until someone withdraws from the bot to an external address.
Hopefully that makes sense.

gernika's response is a byte from some well-known tech writer (can't remember who right now). He was referring to people calling Bitcoin a bubble. If Bitcoin is a bubble (and nobody can know), then it may have very little value. This is what he is explaining. On the other hand, if Bitcoin is truly what its proponents believe it to be, it absolutely will revolutionize money and markets as we know it.
I'm pretty sure Bitcoin will never trade for nothing ever again, however. Regardless of the worst-case doomsday scenarios, black markets, anonymous transactions, so-called "money laundering", anarchists, and a few niche markets will always see value in Bitcoin.

Coinbase keeps the keys to your bitcoins. You really don't even own the bitcoins while they are in your coinbase account. Coinbase just credits your account a number token (say ฿10.0000). It's just a number, a bookkeeping entry. The actual bitcoins are stored on Coinbase's servers.
Money exchanges usually function the same way. Coinbase is not unque or malicious by doing this, it's just the way their system is set up. They're not really a wallet service, they're more like PayPal. *edit: Keep in mind you can transfer your coinbase BTC to another address as easily as from any other wallet, you'll just want to do that before they get hacked.*
Blockchain.info and other wallets are true bitcoin wallets in the sense that you control the private keys. You can import your keys to blockchain.info (or wallet of choice), which lets you access and send money to other addresses. If you were to delete your private keys on blockchain, your bitcoins are still completely accessible as long as you've saved your key somewhere else (another online wallet, an offline wallet, a piece of paper, your memory, a flashdrive, a tattoo on your asscheek, a livestock brand on your dog's scrotum, an inscription on your girlfriend's inner labia - the possibilities are endless). All these methods have advantages and disadvantages, usually a tradeoff of security versus convenience. Because bitcoins are highly transferable and low cost, most people use a variety of methods.
Frankly, I'd advise against the labia inscription, in case she is cheating on you - the son of a bitch now has your woman and your money.

While fractional reserve banking is definitely possible with Bitcoin, lending institutions will face considerable risks (lack of FDIC or equivalent at present for one), and the digital liquidity and personal banking ease of BTC means substantial incentives to store money in lending coffers will likely be necessary.

This exact knowledge you speak of is inherent to any exchangeable commodity, as long as it's being exchanged. It's called the pricing mechanism. Without getting too deep into the economic theory, prices are first and foremost *information* that relays the relative scarcity of a resource to all actors in a given market. It doesn't matter if it's dollars and bitcoins, chickens and plutonium, or hookers and blow. All that is necessary to price a good or commodity is to *exchange* it and find out. The market, which is the aggregate of similar or identical trades taking place in a common setting, bears the price during the exchange.
"How much will 1 bitcoin be worth in 3 months?" is actually a easier way of asking "What price will the market bear for bitcoin in terms of dollars (or euros, or pounds, or kilos of corn, or gallons of milk) in 3 months?" We don't know the answer because we can't predict the *quantity to be supplied* or the *quantity to be demanded* in 3 months time. In fact, the only reason we know **now** what price(s) bitcoins will buy or sell at is precisely because they are being bought and sold on exchanges as we speak.
If I "hoard" my bitcoins, it's the same as dying with a brainwallet. Because in either case, those bitcoins are not being circulated and market actors realize this by seeing a smaller supply (relative to last week, when I was still alive and well, buying and trading with bitcoin all day long) while the same quantity is demanded. It's a restriction of supply, and the price goes up. The purchasing power of 1 BTC increases because you now have fewer of them to spend on the world's real material wealth. When you restrict supply indefinitely (as in dying with a brainwallet), this is called deflation. The supply of bitcoins has dwindled, while quantity demanded remains. Conversely, if the supply of bitcoins remains the same, but demand increases, we see deflation. They're the same action, just seen on different ends of the graph.
The inverse of deflation is inflation, whereby the supply is (permanently) increased or remains the same, and the demand (permanently) remains the same or decreases, respectively.
**TL;DR Knowledge of a commodity's relative scarcity is reflected in the respective markets' response to supply and demand. No real wealth is lost if bitcoins are lost. The existing wealth is redistributed to the remaining coinholders through the pricing mechanism.**

I'm not sure about the bitcoin network having too much of an impact. I read in another thread here that trades on MtGox and other exchanges typically don't involve actual BTC transactions. It's all internal metrics maintained in the exchange's database; only on actual withdrawals does BTC or other currencies actually change hands. 
Once you make a deposit to MtGox, your funds are held in escrow essentially and your account is credited on paper (so to speak). Trades take place and the respective parties' accounts are debited and credited accordingly. Withdrawals come out of the greater MtGox escrow wallet (or smaller wallets depending on the exchange's security/bookkeeping).
That's just my understanding of it. If somebody more knowledgeable than I would like to comment on the matter...

The uniquely interesting thing about Bitcoin is its incentives which we *retroactively* see are successful at helping it grow. Experiments like Bitcoin (game-changing "anti-establishment" projects) happen all the time, we just don't see most of them. It is highly unlikely the government would come down to squash Bitcoin in its infancy - they'd have no reason. It's certainly not the first electronic cash scheme and it probably won't be the last; none of these have ever come under fire by government when it first started.

Currency-to-currency exchanges (all of them) primarily exist to facilitate those who wish to enter and exit markets with differing money bases. For the last 100 years or so, governments have artificially restricted the accepted moneys in their respective jurisdictions, to a very successful degree (exceptions being the US dollar and Euro as de facto currencies outside their legal zones). Bitcoin doesn't fit this world of geographical control, and therein lies huge value. A frequent traveler could see vast sums lost to exchange at legacy currency vendors, credit card issuers, and ATM machines. Bitcoin offers clear savings in this respect, even now in its early adopter stage. And the future looks even better if businesses begin accepting BTC directly around the world. Think of it like this: Bitcoin's potential market outperforms even highly liquid currencies like the dollar and euro, because it naturally has no physical boundaries and barriers to acceptance and transfer.
But think back to what a money is - a placeholder for real-world value. You and your employer mutually agree that your work is worth such and such per hour, annum, contact length, etc. You both then "look up the exchange rate" for [work preformed]:[currency of choice*] and determine your wages. This isn't of course what we think we're doing when accepting a job offer, but the fundamental economics are there. Money exchanges are useful while Bitcoin is in its infancy, but the majority of their current use are largely part of the transitional phase before direct exchange is commonplace. All Bitcoin needs is time to allow the network effect to work its magic until employers/employees agree to exchange in BTC. The critical mass is already here - Bitcoin is here to stay, for better or worse. 
*"Choice" might be an optimistic term for this currently.

This isn't entirely accurate. Decentralization doesn't mean magic happens in the aether. Individuals make decisions, always and always, and if enough people make the right or preferred decision, life goes on. What happened here is that enough people trusted a group of informed and knowledgeable developers to give sound advice. Their advice did not need to be followed, but it was in the rational self-interest of miners to play along. Further, this advice was openly and quickly verified; there was no blind trust or obfuscation of facts.
Don't confound decentralization with centralization - that is, don't confuse *voluntary, informed adherence by a network of individuals* with blind, coerced manipulation by an arbitrary authority.

This is interesting. Let's be honest, anarcho-capitalism is not a mainstream ideology, much like communism. It's marginalized because it's seen as radical from the status quo. Nothing wrong with that, it's human to think this way.
But Bitcoin's success basically necessitates at least a somewhat disruptive degree of political/economic discussion. It already has started. Bloomberg is talking about it, and putting on some pretty strong libertarian language for a mainstream source, even if most are editorials.
I'm curious to see what the public perception will be when the emperor is forced to take off his clothes. Along with cryptomessaging, 3D printing, and the evolution of the Internet itself, Bitcoin is poised to truly change society for the better. Not to mention the ripple effects of a number of anarchocapitalists potentially becoming very rich. There are a surprising amount already: Peter Schiff for one, and the CEO/founder of Whole Foods is definitely ancap.
The potential for change is there if we don't squander it.

Hoarding is an intentionally pejorative term used in lieu of savings. It's used by economists like Krugman who believe economics is as provable as say, math or quantum physics.
Other than that, Bitcoin does encourage savings and is inherently deflationary. I think OP was referring to Krugman's heavy-handed decisiveness about concepts that are still very much debatable.

But nearly all currencies are priced according to the markets in which they sell. Bitcoin is no different. Central issuing authorities do not set prices, at least not directly (inflating certainly makes it go in a specific direction, but unpredictably). The only argument you might have is that Bitcoin markets are so few or small that the pricing differentials are too big. In other words, the markets are not large enough or liquid enough to mitigate opportunities for arbitrage.

But this is exactly what isn't true. I appreciate the sentiment, but here's why Bitcoin needs a larger cap.
A wealthy citizen cannot move large sums money into and out of Bitcoin without causing a big disruption in price in the meantime, which affects his conversions. This is an essential aspect of liquidity, and it's something Bitcoin is hurting for. That's why I like to see the market cap increase.

I had a very civilized and interesting discussion with in It started out with a quick jab at PayPal on my part, then went into a worthwhile discussion on some finer points of Bitcoin. It involved very little of the anti-fiat "craziness"*, instead focusing on why it is important and accessible to anybody.
Regardless of this contest, which is nonetheless a good idea, I'd like some honest feedback from other Bitcoiners on the discussion.

I certainly would like to see you able to buy groceries with Bitcoin from your local corner shop, but that may not be what Bitcoin is useful for. In the end, Bitcoin may turn out to dominate the internet economy and little else. Would this mean it's not successful?
Some food for thought:
* Is [Baidu]( not successful as a search engine because it is only used in China?
* Is French not successful as a language because it is not used worldwide?
* Are smartphones not successful because only 47% of Americans use them (2012 numbers)?
Maybe these aren't perfect analogies, but they're all asking the same question. What determines success?
Perhaps more appropriate is the question of any currency: is the Euro not successful as a currency because I can't spend it for local groceries in America?
Bitcoiners have some lofty ambitions for worldwide acceptance (and I'm one of them!) but realize it wasn't too long ago that buying pizza for 10,000 BTC was a strange concept, or that the measure of "success" was *any* brick and mortar establishment accepting them as payment. What will happen if we get to a point where you can buy local groceries with Bitcoin is this: people will exclaim, "Cool, but Bitcoin won't have succeeded until it is the backbone of the global economy!"
If we think along the lines of current currency markets, we see nearly every currency as a niche market, suitable only for use in specific geographical areas - namely, the countries or regions that issue the currency. Bitcoin is obviously not state-issued nor state-enforced, so we may have to break a few rules when trying to properly gauge success. It's often touted as the "money of the internet" and it may turn out to be that and little else. Or maybe it will only be a store of wealth. Or maybe only an in-and-out money transfer system.
My tongue-in-cheek remark about Egyptian horsemeat was meant to illustrate the need for a reasonable perspective. While I'm with you in hoping for every local vendor accepting it, I'm not sure that's what determines its success.

If you sell within 365 days of purchasing, you pay short term capital gains tax on the gains. This is equivalent to your marginal federal income tax rate (look yours up at IRS.gov or Kiplingers, but I'd wager yours to be around 25%). If you hold for longer than a year and then sell, it is subject to long term capital gains tax, which is usually quite lower than your income tax rate (~15%).
If it would be difficult for the IRS to find out about your purchase/sale, don't be an idiot.

I'm a diehard ancap, libertarian, and voluntarist. Really, really. But let's be smart and not turn this sub into a circle jerk. Many a sub has succumbed to this temptation, and let's not be the next.
There's of course no obligation, no social contract, no hard or soft rule about this. But most ancaps I know are very intelligent and can truly think long term. Bitcoin by design appeals to free marketeers and voluntarists the world over, and this is a good thing - the free market continues to be the most empowering and equalizing force humanity has ever seen. But in the end, we absolutely want Bitcoin to appeal to many others, including misguided collectivists and statists (perhaps opening their eyes in the process). 
Why do we want this? "Because it lines our pockets," the cynics will rightfully say. And there's nothing wrong with that. But for some of us, there's a lot more to it. The growth and acceptance of Bitcoin necessitates and simultaneously facilitates the further ushering of a world where sovereign individuals are free to act and serve each other as they please. 
All Bitcoiners, whatever their political philosophy, are stewards of this millennia-long movement. And Bitcoin is not alone in this endeavor. Other sovereign technologies like the internet itself (and its evolution towards a decentralized net), 3D printing, cryptographic email, etc. all further the cause.
We each have two options: rejoice in our newfound monetary freedom and perhaps alienate those who could help but have yet to discover the beauty of voluntarism; or keep pushing for the development and widespread acceptance of these technologies. They aren't mutually exclusive, but they can be if we behave like an overexcited cult. The choice is yours.

If robots replaced the vast majority of labor, it would do so only if the sum cost of automation were markedly less than the wages for equivalent human labor. In such a scenario, the overall costs of products and services would drop, and your purchasing power would skyrocket.
Think of the computer industry. Computers keep getting smaller, faster, more able, and *cheaper* at a ridiculous rate. This means your purchasing power is increasing at the same rate (minus fiat inflation). Now extrapolate this to many other industries - food, shelter, transportation. Things would become seriously cheap, not just nominally but truly cheap in that any given combination of capital, raw materials, and labor would cost much less than they do today.
The fear of robots eliminating labor and subsequently making us poor is called the Luddite fallacy, and well... it's a fallacy.

The destruction of arbitrage opportunities are a really good thing for Bitcoin, too. A large discrepancy in prices is screaming to investors/speculators to tap into that exchange.

1. Basically yes. They're trying to guess the nonce that will result in a hash which satisfies the target requirement.
2. No, the network is completely dependent on miners. But "mining" is really a misnomer. Or rather, you could separate the function of miners into two distinct yet largely dependent processes:
* Auditing - confirming transactions by finding blocks and verifying against double spends. This is supported (or will be in the future) by transaction fees, which are SUM(INPUTS) - SUM(OUTPUTS). This incentivizes those with sufficient computing power to dedicate time and energy to the network, thus giving Bitcoin its distributed properties.
* Mining - getting a reward for successfully performing an audit on a block-per-block basis. The actual purpose of mining is to distribute additions to the coinbase (new money) equitably and fairly.
While mining is much talked about, it's actually a secondary function after auditing, which is the most important part.

Nice sidestepping the issue. USD, EUR, etc are stable because they have a much larger and more developed market than Bitcoin, so that derivatives, shorting, options, and in general speculation and usage occurs on a greater scale. Enough players in the market ensures all interests in the currency's value generally act against each other through destructive interference. *This* is stability. It's not magic, it's not "Amuhrican government says this dollar has value, therefore stability". It's a consequence of a mature, complex market economy - and Bitcoin isn't there yet. You may have long-term amnesia, or simply don't care enough to educate yourself, but the Bitcoin economy has made extensive inroads to this end *just in the last 6 months*.
The Roman Empire wasn't built in a day, and Bitcoin enables much greater ambitions.
As for your confused diatribe, I'll say this: those who disdain theory for practicality don't understand what theory is. In any case, you haven't really said anything.

Indeed. I am an expat and attempting to stay out of the US for more than 330 days this year *just to see a partial decrease in my tax liability.* The IRS' tax net extends the world over, and in fact the US is the only country in the world to tax based solely on citizenship and not on residency. 
It's truly an eye-opener to see American "exceptionalism" in action. Of course, it doesn't sway anyone who's already made up their mind. There was a discussion in a while back about it and many responses (from non-expats of course) were essentially poorly reasoned excuse-making for the gubmint.
I forget who said it, but it rings true here more than ever: You cannot use reason to persuade other out of their political philosophy, because they almost never used reason to arrive at theirs in the first place.

The images are timed snapshots of Bitcoin transactions beginning at 11am Eastern US time. Each transaction is represented by a single 2-pixel sphere mapped via relay IP address on a Mercator projection of the world. Most of the data is pulled from Blockchain.info's WebSocket API. Transaction density for specific locations are visualized by heatlines extending outwards from each node.
This is a small part of a much larger real-time visualization project I'm currently working on.
* A transaction's relay IP address is roughly synonymous with the origin user's IP address, though there are some important caveats. Transactions piped through a VPN or TOR tunnel will appear to occur at the location of the end node, though the actual user's location could be anywhere else in the world. Transactions processed through online wallets will also be mapped at the wallet iprovider's location.
* Very rarely an Unknown IP Address error will be thrown, and the associated transaction will be mapped at IPv4 0.0.0.0, which corresponds to 0.0000 degrees long, 0.0000 degrees lat. This will appear as a node in the Gulf of Guinea, roughly 600 kilometers south of Ghana off the coast of Western Africa.
* Trades on Bitcoin exchanges like MtGox, BTC-E, or CampBX, as well as purchases on platforms like Coinbase or ZigGap, typically involve internal bookkeeping and are not mapped. These images only display transactions taking place on the blockchain (which may explain the relatively low node density in Japan).

At this point, Market-Anarchist has drawn the conversation into, well, market anarchism. Market anarchism is veritably distinct from crony capitalism, because crony capitalism requires government.


You were clearly making a point, insinuating that market anarchism is undesirable because Comcast &lt;&lt; government ISP. You've more than implied that a system akin to market anarchism would result in inefficient, uncaring monopolies, and further that benevolent governments (given enough power/money) will create 20 TB/s connections in every household because magic. Benevolent government is benevolent. (Obviously exaggerating.)
So far, so good. You're dead wrong, but at least you're consistent.
Then I invite you to learn about how the very telecom company you painted as a free-market actor is the furthest thing from it, and that in general the telecom industry in the US is heavily captured (aka not market anarchist).


So now you admit Comcast exists in its current state (as a giant POS, let's be clear) precisely because of regulatory capture and is not bound by the free market. **Then why did your earlier response indicate the exact opposite?!**

This is fundamental to a limited-supply currency like Bitcoin, and therefore antithetical to Keynesian economics.

From the blockchain you can use some fuzzy logic to associate identities, like blockchain.info does in its Taint Analysis:


To actually use bitcoin anonymously requires a few more steps, like using Tor browser, sending your coins through a mixing service, and some other techniques you can learn about. Bitcoin is not *de facto* anonymous, it just makes it easy to move digital money anonymously if the user wants to go that route, which is damn near impossible with legacy banking.

There's a persistent misconception on the divisibility of bitcoins. If you cut a gram of gold in half, you have two half grams of gold. If you further subdivide into fourths, you now have four quarters of a gram of gold. Rinse and repeat. But you still only have a gram of gold.

Another way of looking at it is comparing to the US dollar. In 1850, $1 would buy you $4.00 worth of goods today. In 1910, $1 would buy you the equivalent of $3.57 today. In 1960, that's $1.27.
In earlier times, the US cent was actually useful. According to [this article]( in 1910 4 cents could buy you a pound of sugar, 14 cents would buy you a dozen eggs, and 15 cents would get you a pound of coffee. Now, there are [proposals]( about removing the penny from circulation.
This is due to the inflationary nature of the fiat US dollar. Bitcoin is going the other way. Because it is by design a deflationary currency, you will see your coins appreciating as time passes. Like removing the penny from circulation, Bitcoiners may hear proposals to increase the decimal accuracy past 8 points.
In the end it doesn't really matter. If it becomes an convenience issue (very likely) to use full denominations of BTC even though most purchases are denominated in bitcents, you will just see 1.25 bitcents instead of 0.0125 bitcoins. The metric system already provides a very useful arrangement of prefixes as well as other conventions that pop up now and again, like 1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC or 1 satoshi = 0.00000001.

Anonymity should not have this connotation of criminal activity. Can't help that it does, but I think the world is going more the direction of de facto anonymity than the opposite. Here's my reasoning: I want to start a bitcoin-related website that I would tie with my reddit username but not my real-life identity, because sometimes I say things about my job I wouldn't want my employer knowing about, or things about my activities I wouldn't want my government knowing about. Again, nothing illegal, but what's legal today may not be legal tomorrow, and there is nothing wrong with being prudent about your information-sharing. If I post my website here on it would reveal my real-life identity to anybody who cared to investigate. The fact is, my website idea is actually very benign, but that doesn't change how it would link my identities.
Another reason is that the internet is not a geographical jurisdiction, but governments have not yet learned this. For example, laws in China may prevent a user from owning an anti-government website, but the US has no such laws against this. So if I were Chinese and wanted a site on US servers, anonymity could protect me from my own government, and AFAIK would have no adverse legal ramifications on the US host.
I could think of a great many other reasons that easily sidesteps the presumption of crime.

Well it's highly unlikely a profit-driven entity is doing this. It's always more economically favorable to play by the rules, even if you owned 51%. Because some of the things you *can't* do as a 51-percenter include:
* Reverse other people's transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to you
So the real problem is government or some "likes to watch the world burn" entity with enough resources to make this happen.

There's more, but I won't bother to do your homework for you. There really isn't much you can't buy with Bitcoin, even now. In fact, as far as typical expenses go, utility bills, (some) real estate, and fuel are the only ones that come to mind.


It isn't, and I didn't. But politics are neither **necessary nor sufficient** for the stability of any currency, despite the calm reassurances of our talking heads.


Bitcoin is a digital currency, and currently has no non-trivial competition. While "first to market" and the network effect are important practical concepts in economics, I've also yet to come across any alternative digital currency showing any consequential benefits over Bitcoin. Apparently, I'm not alone.
I'm all ears at this point; I genuinely like the idea of competing currencies. Now you can wax poetic all day long about how Bitcoin is merely one of many, but until you bring forth the argument for a *better* one, your angry quips aren't likely to get you very far.

Just a quick correction. An address is not exactly the same as a public key, though for all intents and purposes they're close. An address is a hash of a public key, plus a version number, plus a checksum.
* Obviously the public key is the most important part and is hashed to obfuscate the true public key in the event some (extremely unlikely) vulnerability to elliptic curve cryptography is discovered and exploited. It's actually a trivial mask, because it really won't do much to protect you. Though the extremely low chances of this happening practically makes this step an unnecessary redundancy, the developers are nothing if not thorough.
* The version number is included to ensure easy backwards compatibility in the distant future where a new Bitcoin protocol needs to behave differently than previous versions - a version number makes it easy for the new protocol to treat pre-Bitcoin X.0 addresses properly.
* The checksum is included to make it more difficult to accidentally enter the wrong public key/address when spending bitcoins. It's very similar to the way your standard UPC barcodes work with checksum digits on either end of the actual product code. If you get a character wrong typing in the address, the hash and the checksum won't match up and it should deny the transaction due to an invalid address format.

Drmoo66 is falling for the same fallacy as those who proselytize the dangers of a deflationary currency. "If I think my coins will be worth more tomorrow than today, I won't spend any and I'll be rich!" The fact is, people spend (or exchange) money on products and services that they want and need today because they need it today and not tomorrow - like food, gas, and rent. There will always be those who need to spend or exchange the money they planned on hoarding for eternity.

Bitcoin isn't useful for only consumer retail. It's used for, or has the potential for, a great number of utilities. This is where it derives its value, in addition to investment growth expectations and consumer retail. This includes:
* b2b services
* general savings
* hedge against fiat currency devaluation
* bypass over articially imposed barriers (e.g. capital controls)
* industries that value pseudonymity (e.g. drug trade)
* migrant and foreign worker remittance
* loans and collateral
Moreover, one company's transaction volume does not represent the world's usage of a borderless currency, even for just consumer retail.

Don't be butthurt about it. With even just a measly dozen or so comments, others can make a decent value judgment over whether somebody is real or a shill. But who knows, I'm probably just a disgruntled employee or competitor of ZigGap with 5 months to waste and I'm trolling.
Feel free to make your own judgment, but I think the time you've had an account matters less than the number *and depth* of comments and links. Sure, I won't be on any reddit leaderboards any time soon, but that's not the point. Other redditors are able to look at my history and determine if my views are coherent and inline with theirs enough to trust the comment in question. Likewise, if I babble on about the Second Coming of Christ at PayPal's next board meeting, or the finer details on how to rape sheep, I can safely be disregarded as a quack or shill. But when you have 2 comments, others can't make either of those judgments.
Thanks for your response btw. I wasn't trying to insult, I'm just consciously wary when spending my hard-earned money - as I'm you would be as well.
Well I still sound like an asshole. I should work on my wording. :)

The part about propaganda?
If Satoshi comes out as the Creator of Bitcoin, he'll be ignored by most, praised by many, and villified by the few powerful that have something to lose. If you wanted to destroy something that is very difficult to destroy due to its nature (highly decentralized), what better way than to destroy its creator? Make him an enemy of the people, a terrorist, a pedophile, or a rapist. 
Look at Julian Assange and the character assassination that ensued after the last major WikiLeaks fiasco: targeted allegations of rape. There are many examples throughout history. It's a very useful tool.
Bitcoin itself is not immune from these attacks either. Its association with the Silk Road, drugs, money laundering, scams, etc. all play a part in how people experience it. Add a person to that equation, a figurehead, and you've got the perfect target to attack and build negative associations.

Don't misunderstand me. I know full well that Bitcoin is far from a mainstream currency. What I said is that there isn't much you can't buy with Bitcoin, and I stand by that statement. You may have to buy through internet business, but that's certainly not an economy that's getting smaller or less relevant any time soon.
Money exchangers certainly do help people use Bitcoin. They are essential for price discovery, liquidity, reducing transaction costs, and yes they even play a significant role in stability. Money has many more uses than simply purchases, and any honest critique would be remiss to ignore them.
And you conveniently disregarded the growing number of legitimate businesses that accept it for purchases (a weak proof of practicality).


You're absolutely correct here, and I apologize. I'm not sure what I was thinking. Can I blame it on the lack of sleep? ;)


Cool story, but stating it as fact doesn't make it so. You'll have to do better than that.


Let's talk sincerely about those drawbacks then, right here.
I think we've covered stability. It's *not* a matter of time, it's a matter of economic development. If you'd like to discuss this further (maybe sans the cheap shots we're both guilty of), please say so.
I am genuinely curious to hear about the drawbacks you see, because they might be a great business opportunity.

Well the very definition of black markets mean governments cannot close them down, at least not for any real length of time. So if Bitcoin does indeed have a black market baseline value, that's probably a good thing. Black markets have always and will always exist as long as governments exist - it's one of the major hallmarks of a controlled society.
And you should familiarize yourself with the relative possibilities of government successfully closing down the "enterprise" of Bitcoin. You might be surprised how even an all-out effort on their part would be futile in the long term.

So here we have OP who is wanting to move money to HK fee-free.
Has he obtained money from illicit activities? **We have no idea, and no reason to suspect.**
Has he concealed the money with intent to leave the country? **We have no idea, and no reason to suspect.**
Using the bitcoin network to move money is NOT concealment. He is just as likely to report the transaction to the IRS or any other suitable authority as he is not to.
