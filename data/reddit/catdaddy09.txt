The discussion sounded like and advertisement and endorsement of the USD.  
"The US government and the NFL endorse the USD as it's official currency!"

Good for you. People will hate. Usually it's people not in the know who catch those flashy headlines saying it's a scam, bubble, or over valued because they want to seem up on the latest news. Ignore them.

No. Lets examine it. Nobody accepts their demise. Rather, the low intelligence voters in some of the bible thumping states continue to vote in republicans who would rather support a new tax plan that hands money to the rich, limits deductions for the middle class, and raises the national debt by trillions. They will continue with this plan for a while until the deficit becomes an issue and new budgets need to be made. They will look at the budgets and go to their constituents. "This is crazy! This isn't how you balance a checkbook or run a business! These debts need to stop!" and then they will point at their constituents who rely on entitlement programs, healthcare programs, and other safety net programs and go "These lazy people just want a hand out! They are the ones taking all of your tax payer money!!" Then some shill or troll will make some post about working for their money while those on welfare take advantage of tax payers. Fox news will run a report on how food stamps or healthcare budgets are over inflated and how we are just "giving money away" to those "too lazy to work for it." The low information and under educated voters who have been religiously watching fox news and their party's candidate will start to believe what they are being told. They will vote for the politician vowing to take away Obamacare because "Obamacare is socialism!" neglecting to realize that the Affordable Healthcare Act that they are covered under is in fact obamacare. They will vote for the politician who is going to give tax breaks to major corporations promising that those corporations will pay their employees more. Except these same corporations now take their operations overseas or layoff workers. They vote the idiots in by painting the other side as moronic or giving away free stuff that "true americans" work for. Trying to pat them on the back while saying that "you aren't the problem, they are" allowing them to not feel poor/uneducated. They aren't poor, it's those guys! You aren't the problem! If that group of people wasn't so lazy your life would be great. So the idiots vote. Then grandma needs to go in for serious cancer treatment that costs a lot of money. But her medicaid has been slashed to abysmal levels where the financial burden becomes an issue to where they seriously consider if it's worth getting grandma treated. "Well, she is 75 after all. How many more good years will she have left? Is it worth $100,000?" But they can't even ponder the financial burden because the husband was laid off from the coal plant and those safety net programs he voted to have slashed aren't adequately paying his bills or putting food on the table. He is struggling to find another job because in his rural area all of the manufacturing jobs have moved overseas or their wages have stagnated. The wife has been working part time as an administrator at the local public school but her hours and salary have been cut in recent years due to the slashing of the public school funding. So now grandma is faced with crippling debt. Even if she was able to get a line of credit to pay off her medical bills we have allowed credit companies to attach predatory fees and APR to credit lines for those with bad credit or low income. So now grandma has to put 100k on a line of credit with a 32% APR. Grandma's cancer treatment has now allowed the drug companies, health care industries, and the financial industries an incredibly large sum of money on over inflated prices and interest rates. A tragedy in the family has required them to take on debt and loans to pay for artificially inflated healthcare prices. 
They don't want the alternative. They want debt. Debt makes money. Sickness and illness makes money. Education, healthcare, and employment limits debt and increases awareness. They want dumb and sick minions to be forced to go into debt. Debt is the slave labor or indentured servitude of our modern times.

Oh and relentlessly email you

True question. These accounts promoting bcash have to be pump jobs right? They seem to say the same things

And that's pretty much the exact email I would get.

I believe the content they found in the bockchain were links to pornographic material or links to locations that hosted the content. Not on the blockchain itself.

I stand corrected. 
Isn't this more of a symptom of decentralized data transmission which is essentially what the blockchain is? Anything decentralized essentially means that there isn't much governance. Even if there was some capacity for it, the capability to enforce rules on essentially a decentralized system would be difficult.

Also, I can't help but feel the old clunky ways forums are setup tend to be pretty outdated and don't really allow you to get a "feel" for what is currently going on in the community. Posts often have no real way to identify timeline or age. Too many stickied posts. All replies are treated as top level.

I meant boo at the fact that it was true.
