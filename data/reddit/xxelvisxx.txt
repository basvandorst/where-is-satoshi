I have no idea. I was referring to the hypothetical cash giving granny. I would have to assume the cost basis would be value at time of transfer. But again, that's a guess.
Still not a reportable event though unless value was greater than 14k. Then the girlfriend reports

He never needs to report anything. Granny needs to report at a certain dollar amount(14k?).  Granny doesn't pay taxes though, it counts towards her lifetime gift limit that is 5.3 million dollars.  When she hits that number she needs to pay tax.
The vast majority of people complaining about gift tax won't ever pay a cent of it.

They've certainly already got you beat in shipping times.  I placed an order here days after placing an order with you.  I've already received their order, and you haven't even put mine in the mail yet.

electrum also has a few tor servers

That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough to dispute it.
My fans make noise, where did that energy come from?
Unless you are talking about my comment on heat pumps, they can be up to 300% efficient.

The vast majority of wasted power goes to the creation of heat.  If you were already paying for electric heat through a baseboard or space heater all of the waste suddenly becomes useful.  This doesn't apply if you are using a heat pump though as they are much more than 100% efficient.
I used to shut off my dual 5970 setup that produced more than a bitcoin a day back then during the summer.  It was really a useful heater during the winter.  It was always profitable back then, but moreso in the winter.

I can't get over the fact that I need to create an account just to find out where there are locations at.
Since it is very likely there isn't one close to me as I don't live in a large metropolitan area, I can't be bothered to create an account.

Well, then OP's bitcoins would all be free if he used it in the winter to replace electric baseboard heating.  Not counting depreciation of equipment since he values it at 0.
Thanks for the info

Remember when this guy said he went to mtgox and everything is ship shape, no need to worry

This wouldn't change the cost of the electricity.  If you hooked up a solar panel and didn't use it for this you would use less of the full price grid power.
The only way it would become more profitable with a solar panel is if you produced enough to pump it back out to the grid and you were getting paid very little for it.

Maybe even 0% if you're poor

Can you explain this comment?

Then take their pile of cash and do what exactly with it?  Certainly not invest it or buy any real tangible assets.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:19:13
Not necessarily.  You are assuming all mined coins go directly to market

In the US during the lead up to the crash, you could borrow 110% of your homes value if you were well qualified.
Also, you could secure a No Doc loan if you had a good enough down payment.
I want to live in that world.

These things need ID for any amount? Is 5% fee standard? 
I got excited for a second
