My name is Gabriel, and I work at Brawker. The service is pretty new (just few weeks). That's the main reason why you don't find a lot of things about it yet. Le service is not dead at all, at the contrary, we're working to be more alive everyday :)
By the way, I'm inviting you to watch the video below, and to try Brawker. We'll be happy to get feedback from you !

I'm Gabriel and I work for Brawker.
Just want to say that jjmaps is right on every points: This is indeed the "buyer" side that pays the discount with a higher bitcoin rate defined by the "spender" once he created the order.
You were also right on explaining why would people pay more to get their bitcoins with our service.
 if buying bitcoins without any fees is easy for you anywhere else online, I'm sure you'll be happy to purchase goods with them anywhere online with discount! Am I right? ;)
