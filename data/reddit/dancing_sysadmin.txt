I don't know about that. It seems like it'd be a much greater use of time and resources and people's intelligence to find a way to subvert or work around the regulations, not try to gain a more Bitcoin friendly atmosphere. Bitcoin isn't like weed, its far far more subversive than that.
More importantly, the increase in tax revenues from free currency trade would be more than offset by the loss the dollar hegemony. The global use of the dollar is the one and only thing keeping the wheels turning, from welfare to the military, and there's no way they are going to ever let that go without bringing guns, tanks, bombs, and death.
Agorist action is probably the best way to work around it, subverting the government, ignoring its dictates, and starving it until it can no longer attack us. This takes a long time, but I really thought Bitcoin would be a fantastic way to speed this up. Posts that advocate playing the game and begging the government to allow us the use of the currency we created as a community and developed and experimented with and lost and gained and stuck with as a community will only remove the true value of the Bitcoin protocol to the world: free, secure, global payment. Anything less, I might as well use Paypal or USD.

I thought that part was weird. I read some about the Argentine monetary issues back when I was in college, and I distinctly remember that the issue was pegging the peso to the dollar that caused the collapse, not getting rid of the monetary boards.

Here's an overview of the protocol.

This is some kind of bitcoin porn. Fantastic job.
