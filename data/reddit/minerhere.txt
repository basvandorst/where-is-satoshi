that's pretty much the reason why i mentioned it not being genuine.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:57:34
Speculation can do wonders.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:19:34
Rumor... debunked!
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:49:33
I'm the type that forgets to pay my monthly bills often, I'd rather keep a credit card on file for a monthly-paid service like Netflix to pay, and then use bitcoin to pay my monthly credit card bills....
It'd be great for Bitcoin media and coverage though!

The snorkel MUST be blue or it won't work
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:48:08
haha i sure hope so. he's gotta eat.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:44:58
so if hash rate ever dropped (theoretically), difficulty would still rise?
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:06:32
OP, please re-fix. That finger isn't shining hard enough.
@_date: 2014-01-18 06:44:44
What's makes this so special?
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:53:38
MTG = MTGox?
MTG = Magic The Gathering?
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:29:30
Cool story bro!
@_date: 2014-01-18 06:42:09
Everyone, grab something. It's a bitcoin circle jerk!!
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:39:41
You have wayyyyyy too much time. But this deserves an up vote.
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:04:02
I'm sorry. Ripples was a joke to begin with.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:24:59
those watching the super bowl would be so confused lol
@_date: 2014-01-11 08:44:31
Kudos to the creator. Job well done.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:24:24
That'd be awesome but it'd cost way too much... a 30 second commercial during the super bowl would cost like $5-$10 million? It took Coinbase almost a year to acquire $30 million from their investors...
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:32:16
Lol scram kid, you know nothing.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:01:19
I spoke too soon without checking. Thanks for clarifying that.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:36:04
If you can.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:11:18
Looks like the result baby of a Chinese coin from ancient times and a bathroom token
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:43:05
I know what u meant, but I believe the only way to do recurring payments at current times is through allowing them access to your API so they can control the recurring payments.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:37:32
That's a whole $30 bucks to your name. I wouldn't feel too good if I was in your situation.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:40:26
It's feasible. It actually already exists.
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:13:48
the banks would still open at 9am and close at 6pm. a new kitten would be born. bob would still go on his date with jane. nothing new really.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:48:08
I wouldn't be surprised if they were produced in china though. explains the long wait times for the already extremely delayed delivery.
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:50:47
To me, your story sounds like a complete fairy tale.
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:10:10
I'll gladly accept your offer.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:45:32
perhaps you guys are right but i feel ripple is so investor driven and it's not authentic or should i say, genuine. there's such a huge market cap in ripples right now. take that and spread it among other cryptos and you've got a rise in value. my thinking may be a bit off.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:04:29
BRO, COME ON. At least cover up the decimal point after the $5 so you seem more of a big spender. Now people are going to think Bitcoin users are cheaps. Upvoted nonetheless :)
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:12:12
This is amazing. How'd you even get this on Wikipedia?
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:37:53
So pretty much the difficulty will continue to rise as all these new miners become faster and more advanced?
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:11:04
a new kitten would be born.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:12:44
Go with Multibit. Don't ask why, it's too much of a headache to explain. But just know they are the best.
As for mining, think of it this way... like digging for gold. You wanna do it? Then you have to invest lots of $ into equipment. If you're up for that, check out and research there.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:30:08
Good luck OP. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:14:13
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:27:56
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:22:28
thanks for chiming in. maybe, but it'd be risky to give them (or anyone else) my crypto wallet API key... 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:13:28
That's because the majority of China is ASLEEP! Wait until they wake up.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:26:09
You never know. Say a company such as Apple who's currently working on their own digital payment system sees Bitcoin as too big of a threat? I'd bet a hundred bitcoin that doing something to manipulate the btc market crossed their mind. And they're worth $500 bil. What's $10 bil to them if it means bringing them more money?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:27:23
I absolutely agree, $10B really is nothing to huge corporations with mad dough. Wal-Mart? Fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:31:37
But not in the long run, buddy.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:56:29
I'm fiat broke but I have 75k shares in Apple stock, and I'm 14.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:30:28
It's not going to stay that low forever. That 200k could turn into 2m easy with the help of a government, the media, and people with fear.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:31:27
That's EXACTLy what I meant to say.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:40:29
Not with the help of the government.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:33:00
No need to sound salty and offended. It's just a discussion topic. The reason I bring this up is because any large company who would have an intention to maliciously control the market can do it at anytime.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:04:49
True, but a large company doesn't NEED to buy 12m bit coin to gain control. They only need a large percentage of the total out there. Still viable by many of the largest companies in the world, in my opinion. Also, what if two or several big corps merged and tried to do so? Then whatever you had previously stated would in fact be viable and your argument becomes invalid. Just a perspective from the opposite side.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:24:38
Milton Friedman was the real Satoshi.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:22:31
There's a trillion things corps with money can do and you're really asking this? Seriously? Try expanding the web of creativity inside your brain and think of the possibilities this topic puts forward.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:31:05
U sound broke.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:09:50
Yup, a buy wall for the past 30 minutes
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:08:03
Don't be mad. Why hate? Did u get your anus touched as a kid?
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:34:24
149 dudes and 1 chick
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:17:04
Could be either someone or a bunch of people buying small amounts.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:19:56
I up voted but on a serious note, anyone new to cryptocurrencies  or mining would probably be extremely confused watching this video.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:22:37
The government will be printing over $500m between the time now and tomorrow same time. And then another 500m in the following 24 hours. And another $500m there after... and on and on. U sure about that?
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:40:01
The only reason. Money.

@_date: 2013-12-20 00:39:45
Where did you get 10% from? I don't think that's accurate.
