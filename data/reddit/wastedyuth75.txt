Would you like to include LukeJr in that list since he wants to decrease block size to 128k? Szabo also isn't against block size increase at all, he's against unrestricted block size. Maybe before you pretend to have a clue, quote people that actually support your ignorance. Having been active in the community and mining since 2012 I can spot a baby Bitcoin wannabe when they start name dropping their stupidity.

The hardfork code is just fine. The BU implementation is bad. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:26:24
Honestly starting to think this UASF bs is just an AstroTurf flood. 90% of the accounts posting about it don't even understand what it is.

Mangina is a stupid child. Don't waste your time. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:54:40
No it didn't. They stole 30% of customer funds to gamble the market with while they froze withdrawals. The fact that they may have gotten "lucky" changes none of that. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:29:42
Pretending that literally ANY change to the blockchain is 100% risk free is simply false in 100% of cases. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:02:02
In their defense, fees a month ago were a fraction of today and it's affecting them massively. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:27:05
Core no longer has a valid excuse to keep quiet, and neither does Bitmain. Get your shit together and so this now!
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:43:01
Only idiots support UASF with a SegWit + 2 MB as an alternative. Personal opinion, but there is no sane rebuttal. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:28:19
That doesn't have anything to do with a hard fork. Jesus why do people that don't have the knowledge have an opinion?

TIL: Bitfinex runs the Brazilian stock market. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:31:56
More fake news from AstroTurf idiots with zero knowledge. Yay
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:26:44
Ha ha. Yeah, cause pointing out that it's a lie that you can scale without SegWit is so shill. Sit down retard, you are dropping the IQ by proxy. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:45:09
Dear child. I can buy and sell you without using cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:56:47
Decentralization is PART of what makes Bitcoin valuable. Bitcoin needs decentralization, but there is a weight between decentralization, and many other aspects that have to be considered. If you focus only on making sure that every Dick, Tom and Harry can run a full node independely of internet speed or storage you end up with a greatly decentralized network that no one can use.

Ok, "serious redditor named test99912" who isn't just a pathetic child making minimum wage posting. Buh now. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:14:14
Sure it is.

Oh snap. This 13 year old is serious! Who cares about Ver, it's about technically smart solution. Not boy band hero worship tween. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:42:37
Just send more fees to push it through. Some wallets have a function for it (Schildbach Android Bitcoin wallet comes to mind). 
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:33:58
Except getting around confirmation time delays, high fees and congestion. Which is exactly what the post is about. 
Hey, there autistic! 
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:24:45
Not really considering it was $400 a few months earlier. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:31:20
This argument is so old and incorrect it's laughable. Do you want a global currency ecosystem worth $100s of billions or do you want a decentralized ledger no one takes seriously but allow people in Burkina Faso to run full nodes on a modem? Choose one. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:53:03
Literally nothing they do will make up for them stealing 30% of customer funds. Period. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:30:52
Unintelligent people make bas arguments. You are clearly one of them. 
Arguing that "any change is good" when the network functions is not only totally false but stupid. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:15:15

Ding ding, we found the dumbest person in the thread. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:23:47
No. It isn't. Do you have some kind of malfuction or just a terrible understanding of the English language? Or are you maybe just aspiring to be a BuzzFeed writer?
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:01:40
And still, UASF is dead in the water. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:43:35
Why wait? Just sell it now and we can get rid of the UASF AstroTurf children. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:28:15
And it makes zero difference if you don't hold a lot of coin. But sure. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:54:58
In their defense. Who the hell uses Jaxx on a PC? It's an Android/iPhone client for keeping small amounts on. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:02:45
At this point you don't have to worry. 2x will get 90%+ support within a month and SegWit will activate with uncontested hardfork around Xmas. Best of both worlds. Keep your coin wherever you want to.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:47:11
Says every Bitcoin noob that somehow bought the AstroTurf pipedream of 51% "economic consensus" for UASF without BitPay or a single Chinese miner, or larger economic entity.
Where are we at now after 3 months of UASF campaign? Oh yeah.. like 15% and most of them nodes that don't matter. 
No wonder people are hedging in Litecoin and ETH. This community is a ecochamber travesty and comments like this just proves how inept people are. 
"2x scam is not SegWit", time to put on your idiot hat. Since the 2x proposal is exactly that. SegWit + blocksize fork in the future. 
With friends like these, Bitcoin needs no enemies. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:35:13
I doubt any sane person is scared of UASF reaching 51% in the next 6 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:35:21
That's a dumbass argument. I am against BIP148 cause it's a shitty voting mechanism. Period. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:13:34
And conversely it's also worthless without miners. Whats your point? 
Only thing that it does just fine without is developers that refuse to accept the opinion of both users and miners. So, core.. you night be out of a job soon.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:27:36
Like "how will UASF reach 51% in 5 weeks when it took 2 months to reach 15%" ? Or.. why is core still stonewalling 2xSegWit when 90% of the community wants it?
