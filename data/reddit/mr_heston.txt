You’re downloading the blockchain for your wallet to synchronize. When it synchronizes it will show you your current balance. Good luck mate :)

Bitcoin blockchain is able to stream 10 transactions per sencond. Their cost is between $0.5 up to $60 (when many miners switched about a month ago to BCC that was a cost for one transaction). Good luck using it as a currency.

Mate BTC is a store of value if it were to go mainstream we would probably use mBTC but I think it won’t become a mass payment option.

If you don’t have the private key, there is no way to restore your BTC

Check the address you sent your BTC to. You will have it in your coinbase transactions, and then search your documents to be sure if you really don’t have the private keys. Also go download electrum wallet, and sweep any private keys you have.

Not a lot but if you want your transactions to go thru in a matter of minutes/hours and not days you’ll have to pay a little extra. With dynamic fees electrum shows me that the least you’ll pay for a transaction is : 0.000311 BTC and it will get around 25 block to receive the transaction. TBH there are far superior coins when it comes to paying. BTC is a store of value.

I just paid 0,5$ for one transaction. I don’t know how about you but when somebody has to pay you 20 $ for eg a part of his restaurant bill, that’s a fuckin high price for a transaction fee.

Fees are too big for now. They would have to pay like a 1-5$ per transfer.

Bitcoin betting is basically like gambling inside gambling gambleception.
Buy BTC and store it. For a year. Much better ROI than gambling

Get Litecoin for transactions. BTC is a store of value until some updates come.

BTC will probably go to 5400, or even maybe to 4900 but as the gentlemen above me said : there is no way to know for sure. If you are planning to hold the coins for longer period, best would be buying smaller chunks. Say spend $100 a week, and this will give you the best effect probably.

You actually can redeem your bitcoin cash mate: here are official instructions from electrum developers. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:50:07
Is there any withdrawal history? And secondly: why would you hold your coins in fockin exchange ????

Somebody made a good comment on reddit: if people wouldn’t make all these transactions, bitcoin probably wouldn’t become what it is today.

This will never happen. The difficulty raises with more and more people mining. If the bitcoin price would be less than the cost of mining, some people would stop mining as it would not be profitable, then the difficulty rate would drop as well, and the mining would become cheaper.

Let me give you an example. You want your friends to pay you in BTC. The post suggests that they don’t use it on daily basis so: they would have to open an account on some exchange and then buy a larger sum, because otherwise they would have to pay an exchange fee every time they’d want to transfer it to you. Then every time they would have to pay the fee for a transfer, lots of fees already. If somebody doesn’t believe in BTC they won’t buy a larger amount just to pay back one friend in it. So the most efficient way is to get $ and buy the BTC yourself.

Bitcoin would never become a viable currency, no government would allow that. You can’t control who’s doing what so for “safety reasons” they would ban accepting bitcoin in stores and so on. But the blockchain tech is here to stay. 
Bitcoin is a safe haven just like gold was for a long time. But there are changes to come when implementing new code, cheaper transactions and so on.

If your grandma is saying stuff like “hodl” “Lambo” “moon” it’s time to sell!

When it comes to new forks, Electrum didn't make any statements yet I guess but it should be safe there.
