"In the future, Bitcoin will either be worth $0, or $12,645.73"

Been around since 2012 (bad hodler unfortunately, so not rich)
Definitely not even close to late in the grand scheme of things, but short term yeah I'm extremely cautious. Way too many weak hands buying in that barely know how bitcoin works, and I think the whales/wallstreet folks are gonna take advantage of that. Also tons of worthless altcoins on coinmarketcap skyrocketing, which can't be healthy.

Can confirm. Been obsessed with bitcoin since 2012. Went from having hundreds to having &lt;5 now. Between the volatility, crashes, sketchy exchanges, hackings, etc, it's hard to imagine many people holding through all of that. Hell even Andreas Antonopoulos says he isn't even a millionaire.

Satoshi actually talked about this:

Actually, not true. I've met Arie and he has been incredibly enthusiastic about Bitcoin for years, and is **very** well connected with a lot of big players in the space. His main interest seems to be blockchain tech, smart contracts, etc, so I would expect his role at Morgan Stanley has something to do with figuring out a way to implement that tech.

Probably because some researcher at Morgan Stanley or something will ask their boss "Hey, I need to learn about this new blockchain thing. Can I go to this training course?" Their boss will say OK and the company pays for it, the employee gets flown to London, sits through a few shitty powerpoint presentations that they don't understand, at night they get drunk with their friends and pay for meals with the company AMEX, rinse and repeat for 1 week. 
They then put together their own crappy Powerpoint that sums up the notes they took to show their boss they actually learned something, then no one on their team mentions Blockchain ever again.

Everyone seems to be pushing R3 aside like it's some small no-name blockchain startup, but how can we ignore something with this large of a backing?
They have to be cooking up something big for all these companies to jump on board.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:16:45
I'm having a really hard time believing companies that huge would operate like that. Even though they have billions of dollars I don't think they're just throwing money at any company that talks about Blockchains.
People like repeating the same "there's no blockchain without bitcoin" line but I'm assuming R3 must have at least some working prototype of a bitcoin-less blockchain. I think this kind of stuff is becoming a reality more than people here want to admit

Had a similar experience with newegg and BTC.
Sent the same amount twice, thinking something went wrong with Coinbase or something the first time (first time I sent, the payment window timer went to 0 and said they never recieved anything.)
Never got refunded for the duplicate amount, even after weeks of back and forth with support, giving evidence, etc. 
Newegg, you still owe me $70 you motherfuckers

Not sure why you're so aggressively against this guy. You can downvote me all you want, I'm just saying I've met him and I know he is very active in the Bitcoin space. Also his actual title is "International Client Advisor - Financial Advisor"
Yes he owns Bitcoin. He mentioned losing a lot when MtGox went under. 
Also there's a lot of people doing Bitcoin related things that you've definitely never heard of. Just because they aren't huge public figures like Andreas or Roger Ver or whoever, doesn't mean they aren't working on anything.
Just reach out to him yourself if you're so suspicious of him. He's an awesome guy and I'm sure he'll be more than willing to talk.
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:25:59
How much BTC does Roger Ver have that he can do bets like this? Hasn't he run out by now?

Coinbase is the easiest for beginners. If you're a little more experienced with stocks/trading, use GDAX which is Coinbase's exchange. 
Also coinbase lets you do automated buying, so I tell a lot of my friends to just buy $100 worth every week or whatever.

Maybe I'm not remembering it correctly, but wasnt the undercover guy that DPR was talking to when ordering the hits the same agent thats now in jail for secretly stealing from SR? If so, it's hard to believe the chat logs coming from the same guy can be used as trustworthy evidence.
Also this is more of my opinion, but the fact that a lot of people surrounding the case said there were multiple DPRs under the same name running the site, makes me doubt that it was Ross ordering the hits. If you read the logs, that DPR sounds quite different from the DPR that went on philosophical rants on the SR forums. Maybe that doesnt hold up in court, but how can they prove that Ross was ordering the hits and not a different admin?
The fact that he admitted to creating and running the site for a short period of time makes him pretty guilty of everything else though. Although in a perfect world he wouldn't have to go to jail for making drug users more safe.

I feel like Chamath has been very quiet about Bitcoin since his Coinsummit panel in 2014. It's a shame because he brought some much needed enthusiasm and legitimacy to bitcoin from that appearance. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 22:23:53
He most likely has some unvested stock in the company, so I could see him sticking around as long as he can until it vests. Even then, his vested stock will expire after a certain amount of years if he leaves, and I'm sure he has a LOT of equity since he was one of the first employees. 
If Coinbase gets acquired or goes public, he'll be a very wealthy man.
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:24:48
Serious question(s), who is paying users back, and why? I know Kraken is involved, but where are they getting money to pay people back these millions of dollars? And why are they even obligated to pay people back? 
I assumed that since this is all unregulated internet money, they have no obligation to pay people back and users knew or should have known the risks.

Also what was the point of their bitcoin miner they released a while back? Does that relate to this at all or was it just a random side project?

But wasn't it part of a larger project to turn every smartphone and toaster into a miner? Haven't really followed bitcoin news for the past 1-2 years, but always had the impression that 21 was playing 4D chess with all these random projects and that some day it'll all come together. 
If all that funding just went into some survey software, then that's really disappointing.

Even though the whole process was shit back then, I somehow feel nostalgic for those days. Something about that annoying barrier to entry made Bitcoin feel really underground. IIRC you had to use Bitinstant too (I forget why though?), so it was like 3 sites you had to deal with just to have a digital currency you could do absolutely nothing with at the time, except buying drugs.
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:09:32
For a second I thought you were talking about all of OpenBazaar only having 5 sales. That would be pretty sad.
Sort of unrelated question - how come OpenBazaar isn't the decentralized Silkroad everyone thought it would be? It seems like a decent alternative to ebay, but I thought the whole point was to be able to sell anything you wanted.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:14:20
Wait, why isn't this post higher up? 
I work for a large tech company. We use Adyen. We were also contemplating accepting bitcoin, but were told to wait for this integration instead of doing our own thing.
There's a lot of even larger companies that I'm sure were in the same boat.

Since it's open source, could people eventually start coming out with their own alt-OB networks under a different name? Not sure how the back end stuff works so maybe that isn't possible, but it seems like it could be similar to Bitcoin.

Basically we have a 22 year old moderator that's on a power trip and no one agrees with anything he does. It's basically like the whole censorship fiasco, except this mod is basically controlling the main news source for a billion dollar industry.
Also i havent been following this specific story in a while, but IIRC he also started a fund to improve the original bitcoin forum and is paying a company millions of dollars to just make "forum software". Pretty sure its been years now and its never been released.
Also, this comment will most likely be deleted

Had a similar feeling when I worked for a tech startup in silicon valley. When I started I was given stock options and told that when we eventually go public they will be worth tons of money. I slaved away for that company under really shitty management, and the company went nowhere. Then I realized even if they did go public, most of the money would go to the board members and executives anyways. Obviously startups aren't pyramid schemes, but there's some similarities. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 15:54:12
Not saying people disagree with his stance in regards to bitcoin. I'm saying no one agrees with the shit he has done to this subreddit. There is absolutely no need to censor open discussion about Bitcoin. If someone is spamming their shitcoin, sure, but trying to control the narrative like that is so fucking out of line.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:56:32
This is probably an unpopular opinion here but I don't think open bazaar will go anywhere until they make it safe enough for drug dealers to use it. I understand the legitimate benefits compared to using a platform like ebay, but I don't think they're compelling enough to attract a lot of users. 
There's still a huge need for a decentralized black marketplace. The current centralized ones are still exit scamming left and right.
