I just bought 5 BTC through PP because I'm not patient enough to wait for money transfers to dwolla. So we're out there.

As stated before, more areas to use BTC's. I think that this is starting to improve. I'd like to work with others to make the software to make this happen.

I agree that ancaps will take to this more than most anarchists.

While I agree with your decision, I didn't want you to get away with thinking you escaped politics. I consider this technology a huge political statement in and of itself.

It was only a matter of time.

I got to walk through an Intel lab of over a hundred servers with FPGA's. They use them for testing new codec firmware designs. It was amazing.

Also, I don't like anarcho-capitalist. I was just being polite.

Don't tempt me. This is very addictive :)

Personally, as an anarchist (not anacap either), I am against capital in general. However, for me the goal is to build a new system inside of the shell of the old. I see bitcoin as a good way forward on that. In a way bitcoin put us in direct control of our means of production unlike any other method before.

Exactly this. I put in $32 after watching the trends and getting a feel for the peaks and troughs. Got out just under peak for $75. About to buy in again. This is just a new floor.

It's sitting on the network until the adress is brought online.

Mac here. Not working because I don't have an AMD card (Nokia's warning if you test for WebCL be enabled).

So you're saying the biggest threat is using Windows then ...
There are several steps that I've seen in the community to help make this less probable:
1. I see a lot of Linux users and I personally use both linux and a mac.
1. These zero day exploits are practically unheard of over here.
1. Most of us are security conscious enough to use the right browsers and keep our systems up to date.
1. Both the latest versions of Ubuntu and OS X have built in encrypted home directories if we want to do so; which would be a good step forward.
1. A lot of bitcoin users are setting up separate savings hashes and keeping the hash keys on a different system or on a flash drive.
1. A lot of bitcoin mining rigs run ubuntu by default.
1. Backup systems are coming online.
1. Keeping your coins in the markets, keeping them close to liquidity until you need to use them, prevents a localized attack on your system.
This is definitely something that needs heeded, but the direness is overblown.

My Python skills are fair but I'm mainly a Ruby coder now. I've done plenty of scraping (enough to thoroughly hate it) and multithreading (which I like actually).
What you are proposing is a email data scraper to build a data base of emails, to subvert captcha protections for registrations or brute force hacks, and to generally do things I don't agree with. Thanks anyways.

Pish. It needs to break 21 USD just for me to break even on what I have. Not that I care. I'm waiting patiently for more useful products, services, and jobs to break out where I can use my coins.
Edit: nice site though.

And now you've hit the beauty of this. If Bitcoin does well the precedence will have been laid for others to enter the market with alternatives, hopefully bettering BTC's in ways that fix problems.
Personally I don't like the way markets run, but I do understand them enough to know that this will most likely work out.

So I've been trying to sell my programming services for bitcoins over the last week and no takers. Are people interested in more than just steam cards etc? I think that we definitely need to flesh out the available goods and services market for btc's. It's a bit like the wild west right now.

I agree with the encryption of the wallet.dat, I just think that the OP has hyped the subject a bit (perhaps out of frustration?).
