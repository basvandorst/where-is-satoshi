Awesome. Thanks for your order! We're still not approved for a larger account so I imagine we'll have problems once we hit the $100 threshold again. Congrats on getting the order in :)
Enjoy your new wallet!

Cheers. I was going to send you a coupon but we'll make it public for BITCOINSAVE10   10% off all orders :)
Edit: Thanks. Still adjusting the new platform. We attempted to add a new title today but it put the entire string on the homepage. Deleted it and we ended up with our name twice. Website is always a work in progress. Busy day fulfilling retail orders but it's on the list. Now to land some retail bitcoin customers :)

Thanks. We're pretty disappointed. We just hope that everyone still shows support once we get a better bitcoin solution integrated. You guys are amazing! We truly didn't expect this much love from the community.

100% of the bitcoin ;)  Most people sell off the entire portion

I think you guys broke bitpay. We received an email saying the daily limit was exceeded. We'll have to get their limit raised.
Appreciate the support everyone. You guys rock!
