You should also realize that developing a distributed mysql database with cryptographic signatures would be a big progress in this industry. The translation settlement processes in place are incredibly antiquated. So you could call it blockchain, you could call it something else, the fact of the matter is that it's new in this industry.
Ah and in case it wasn't clear, big banks are only considering the transaction settlement use case, they are not looking at alternative currencies like bitcoin. Of course this could change.
@_date: 2016-04-15 15:46:50
That's a very good question. I've asked this question to insiders in the banking industry who are talking about blockchains and haven't gotten an answer. I think moving to cryptographic signatures has been long overdue in the financial industry. They are not aiming to have a bulletproof blockchain, just something more transparent than what they're doing right now, which they probably consider too intensive in terms of operations headcount.

The reason I'm promoting the idea of steel recovery seeds is that they are very difficult to accidentally erase, destroy or discard. A piece of paper is much more vulnerable. However my method doesn't protect against physicians theft. You can add a passphrase if you are worried about that. Personally I'm more worried about getting locked out of my coins.

Being "backed" by something was necessary to convince  people to adopt paper money. I'm guessing back in the day, anyone could issue their own paper money and there was no guarantee it would be accepted.
This fear is non existent with cryptocurrencies which have a liquid market. So cryptocurrencies don't need to be backed by anything.

I ordered these plates from as a custom-made item. They are designed to store a BIP39 recovery seed to go along with a hardware wallet (using a letter punch kit, or electric engraver). I had one stainless steel plate made previously but I wanted more plates as backups in different geographical areas. There are a few competing products in this space, but I wanted a nice simple design with multiple plates that can be fastened together with screws and zipties. 
The titanium is extremely strong. It's impossible to bend these by hand unless you plan on seriously injuring yourself, or you have super human strength. The idea is that once your recovery seed is engraved, it's humanly impossible to accidentally erase it. Much better alternative than paper.
There are a few competing products in that space, so you can scroll down to the bottom of the webpage, I believe I've got them all listed, with prices varying from cheap to expensive.

Correct but the bitcoin seller didn't lose money, he just lost an opportunity. If bitcoin reaches a market cap of $50 bil, it doesn't mean that people have put in $50 bil of USD into bitcoin, it just means that the last bitcoin trade price multiplied by the total number of bitcoins in circulation is equal to $50 bil. So in theory the price of a bitcoin can reach stratospheric heights without anyone losing any money in USD terms.

Good advice, but don't use aluminum, the melting point is too low. A very severe and sustained house fire could damage the aluminum. With titanium, you'll have much more peace of mind. The only downside is stamping letters on titanium is a serious workout. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:40:10
My method is described on  the stamping is really a workout and requires hard blows to end up with a legible letter. But I like to think that the energy I expended doing that means it's very very hard to accidentally erase the seed.

From my experience, very elaborate schemes are very likely to lock yourself out of your own funds. I'm a proponent of stamping a plain BIP39 recovery seed onto plates of metal. It makes it very difficult to lose. I listed various recommendations here: 
NEVER enter your seed in proper order into your computer. As bitcoin reaches new heights, I guarantee there will be more and more malware actively hunting for BIP39 words. You are much more at risk of malware on your computer than of physical theft at home.

I disagree. The seed is more important, always. It'll protect you against firmware updates which wipe out the memory of the device and other things.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:36:53
Stamp your private key onto a plate of titanium. Don't put paper in your safe. In case of a severe sustained house fire, the temperature inside your safe may rise and cause the paper to catch fire even without direct contact to flames. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:40:07
Any firmware update is susceptible of wiping out your private keys. You need to back up your recovery seed. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:31:07
Aluminum has a low melting point. If the house fire is very severe, the temperature inside your safe could rise almost to the point of melting the aluminum. With titanium, there is zero chance of that.

I made this to go along with my Trezor. The seed consists of three large 3mm stainless steel plates. The middle plate has laser engravings where the 24 (or 25 for monero) seed words will be punched. The three plates are fastened together with M4 screws and nuts. Then I add zipties of a particular color to prevent peaking inside. The zipties of that color will be kept away so that tampering is more difficult.
The whole assembly weighs over 1kg. The front plate has my name on it, but nothing indicating it's related to cryptocurrency. I will keep two sets in distinct geographical locations. The melting point of 1300 of 316 stainless steel should hopefully allow it to survive a house fire. I wish I could have used titanium but it wasn't available. 
I'm still waiting for my letter stamping kit but i'm pretty excited so far. Wondering whether it would be worth to upgrade to titanium for the higher melting point.

Reddit needs to stop having a rage boner for Jamie Dimon, that guy is irrelevant, i'm not sure why we're giving him so much publicity.

Just because it went up doesn't mean it wasn't risky. Just like joining Google in 1999 was a risky move.

Technically how would you ban bitcoin? And do you think it would be as successful as government's attempts to ban peer to peer file-sharing?

They could do deals with large holders, for example the winklevoss twins. Selling hundreds of millions of Bitcoin at a guaranteed price without impacting the market price would be a sweet offer.

Not every bitcoin transaction is ideological in nature. Even someone who doesn't believe in bitcoin and thinks it's going to crash could mine it in the short term. The fact that they're government employees has no relevance, it doesn't mean "the government doesn't believe in its currency". Just like there are probably thousands of JPM employees who hold bitcoin.

just because it went up doesn't mean it wasn't risky at the time.

The 2 year bear market after mtgox was pretty bad.

That was a 40% drops. A few years ago, 90% drops were frequent.

If someone knows what it is, is motivated to siphon off the funds, then there's nothing you can do. But it may deter someone less motivated, or with less time, they need to find a way to cut the zip ties, etc.

What's the benefit of being paid in bitcoin versus getting paid in fiat and buying bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:03:04
I am absolutely in favor of holding long term, that's what I do myself. But I completely disagree that you haven't "lost money" until you sell at a loss. The microsecond the spot price moves down, you've instantly lost purchasing power, no different than if cash was stolen from you.
Whether this matters or not is a different story.

No, I mean exactly what I said. If no one was physically harmed or threatened during a crime, I don't think the perpertrator should be physically removed from society.

Your coworker's reaction of laughing instead of asking questions is am amazingly immature one. I would not be satisfied with  working in that office.

When has physical security been an issue in the history of bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:43:37
This is absolutely wrong. You can convert in and out of a bitcoin position instantly. This means that being down 50% in bitcoin or down 50% in cash are exactly the same thing. In both situations, you can go back to fully invested in bitcoin, or fully in cash.

Have you tried to send money to a stranger over the internet in minutes ? The traditional banking system doesn't allow that.
Have you tried accepting payments as a merchant with no possibility of dispute or chargebacks ? Bitcoin is the only game in town.
Have you come across a phone-based retail payment system compatible with every smartphone on the market ? Bitcoin has no competition there.

Honestly, they're worried about getting left behind more than anything. If there's a cost reduction initiative on the horizon, they want to be part of it.
@_date: 2016-05-11 22:49:26
Let me make this very clear: banks don't care, and don't feel threatened the least about non-fiat crypto-currencies. (whether they should or not is a different story). 
What they are worried about, is that there's a shiny new tech for **trade settlement** which their investors and counterparties might soon be very interested in. They want to be on that train.

The marketing cost/effort of getting 5 million people to buy bitcoin doesn't become smaller just because China has 1 billion people. I detect the 1% fallacy again.

In the industry, some techniques are still very well thought of as trade secrets. Trading algos come to mind.

Can you share the math on how the current price would go up? How do you know miners won't spin up a few nuclear powerplants and absorb the demand without breaking a sweat, leaving the current price at $280-$300?
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:49:49
I can confirm that a certain number of job interviews in the industry are happening for market research purposes (that doesn't exclude the possibility of coming across an awesome candidate and choosing to hire him).
