the point is: the company saves money but charges you and extra fee for it... it would be gross if overstock would charge you more for paying with bitcoins instead of insecure fiat, wouldnt it?

I was able to withdraw BTC without a verfied account in the past. It was about 20 days ago and I think the notice was already up back then.
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:48:48
Most likely true :D
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:42:24
thats the really important take home message... 
but this situation also shows the power of bitcoin: it looks like a minor flaw (though a huge threat) which can be fixed.

The dossier is several month old. possibly already outdated.
@_date: 2016-03-23 09:45:14
That's actually wrong. The author pointed out that it is likely that not each individual node run by classic-cloud represents funding by one entity. This does not imply what you said. Also that allows no conclusion about all other classic nodes (over 1000). But we know for example that Jihan Wu tried to run two nodes, of which one was taken down very fast by DDoS.
Edit: I did not include sourced because linking to a certain sub is enough to get you banned by thermos.

2011 hodler here. That open and honest discussion about bitcoin was made impossible here is a big part of the current crisis. Thermos is responsible for that.
disclaimer: I did diversify but will keep hodling.

you should begin to read in other bitcoin related subreddits to better understand why people became so negative and use new/throwaway accounts to vocalize their opinions

they count each datacenter once. they do not count replicates.

If only we had an open discussion and community that allows everyone to be informed about the most important topic instead of a one sided and manipulative banning and deleting policy...
@_date: 2016-01-08 08:52:24
vote with your choice. I just unsubscribed from this sub. It is unbelievable how blatantly they attempt to manipulate readers

Back in 2011 I was super frustrated that all the available cloud computing options (like amazon ec2) were nvidia GPU only and thought about setting up an amd GPU rig at my lab (free electricity)... only to end up more coins instead

oh i am not panicking, i am happy to see that a lot of people like usable low fee btc... I really miss buying thai food with my cryptos (lurk me if you want, back in 2013 I used to buy food for what is now average fee...)
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:44:39
I would be biased if I ignored data in favor to keep up my opinions. 
Btw it is even worse if you censor others opinions/data/findings to make your opinions look valid. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:12:35
three of my friends, non of them is involved in bitcoin or other cryptos, independently texted me after the NYT article about mike hearns ragequit. so this "war" has at least some visibility to the general public

I live in Hamburg, most people under 40 here know bitcoin (although they may not understand it or its advantages)
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:15:18
Is Kraken being DDOSed maybe?

Many people think that increasing the capacity gradually will not cause centralization. Technology advances and makes higher capacity cheap enough for the majority. Not everyone must be able to run a full node to keep the system decentralized. 
On the other hand LN is not working yet and if it is not 100% trust less it is not a good solution. It would be easier/saver/more convenient for users to switch to bitcoins competitors which chose not to install this artificial limit in the first place.
But mor important: People have problems to use bitcoin now and will simply use different, working solutions. I used Bitcoin in the past, for example to order food. I will not use it again because it became a unreliable system. Also I do not recommend it now, because of this problem. 
Lastly and maybe most important: The costs for running the network are compensated by the block reward for decades to come, not by fees which drive people away form bitcoin and hindering its widespread adoption.

The Mean/Median time between blocks is 10 min. You know that (hopefully), I know that. And when a new block is found is exactly the time when a new transaction should be confirmed first. Not 2, 10 or 48 hours later. This makes bitcoin useless for many people around the world. For 2 billion people todays "appropriate" fee is 5% of what they earn per day!
While bigger blocks are super simple and easy to implent and help solving many problems now (and possibly later), higher fees do not help anyone if anyone keeps raising the fees. Simple math, such easy, very smart, much wow.
@_date: 2016-05-18 20:26:17
he shouldnt need to be patient. it should have been confirmed after approx. 10 min.
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:54:35
If they would have used "appropriate fee", someone else would have had a stuck TX. Higher fees do not increase the capacity and do not repair bitcoins artfical problem.
@_date: 2016-05-23 14:28:03


True. 
Name one expert that thinks that the network can't handle bigger blocks (hint: every currently discussed solution for immediate scaling by all entities in the bitcoin space will produce bigger blocks, including segwit).

I want a hard fork last year. What would have been totaly reasonable with the right priorities. Have fun with thorough testing of overcomplicated code until the problem solved itself.
And thanks for your insulting discussion style - all I have left to say is have a nice day...

It is a bad one, because people in switzerland (and most other countries) cannot choose freely which currency to use.
However, if you see cryptocurrencies in its entirety as a new, freely chooseable archetype of payment option (=swiss franc) and bitcoin as one specific protocol among many (=bank), the analogy makes sense.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:16:48
Exactly. At the very most you could redirect to a page linking to the original paper as it is + a second pdf as a comment/opinion about what changed since the inception of bitcoin at which time the whitepaper was published. every thing else would be mayhem.
@_date: 2016-07-03 11:15:31
simply 100% wrong he suggested scientific misconduct. counterspeech is the only right thing to do. open development is not broken because people draw attention to illegetimate behavior!
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:03:51
This. Proposing to add changes to a published document... No scientist could ever come up with such an idea or support it.
If you think something is outdated or not accurate you write another paper or a review about bitcoin literature. 
Edit: Doing what cobra suggests is massive scientific misconduct. Showing support for such behavior is as bad.
