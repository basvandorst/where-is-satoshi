How we process numbers is not the reason we are using it. We are using log scale because it makes sense. Instead of asking why we are using linear/log scale, we should ask why we are graphing it and use the relevant scale. The relevant scale is essentially always log scale.

I mentioned P2Pool, but it's an overkill and inefficient. X11 is not a solution either; the reason there ren't ASICs for it is that there has not been enough incentive to make them. Also, switching out the hashing algo would be a mess and should be avoided if possible.

No you don't. If merchants and traders accept the new fork while miners and full nodes accept the old fork, we will have to forks:
 * The old one, which is secure, but whose Bitcoins are worth 0.
 * The new one, whose security is laughable, but whose Bitcoins are worth whatever they are.
In reality, of course, people wouldn't split that evenly, so it would become a big mess, but the concept is the same.

Technically speaking, no. There is a concept of change in Bitcoin payments.
In Bitcoin, every time you receive a payment, an unspent output (sometimes called coin) is created. To send Bitcoins, you spend the entirety of these coins, and decide some addresses that will receive new coins. If you create new coins with a smaller value than the input coins, you will pay the rest as miners fees.
Often, the sizes of your coins do not match how much you want to transfer. In that case, the software automatically creates a new coin in your wallet. This coin is usually called change, and in many ways it acts like change with normal cash.
Change in Bitcoin is, however, likely to be somewhat bigger than change with normal cash, since there is no limitation on the size of a Bitcoin coin.
This is also one of the reasons why measuring the 'velocity' of Bitcoins is hard; you need to figure out whether the output coins are change or payment.

One could argue that that is still somewhat the case today. Suppose you put money in some bank, let's call it Aedron. When you do that, you receive Aedron-money as compensation, which Aedron guarantees deflates a little bit compared to government-money. Aedron has made their payment system in such a way that it's almost seamless to transition between Aedron-money and government-money, but the distinction can still happen, such as if Aedron collapses.

They make people who use cash pay too. Additionally, cash has other problems (storage, robbery, etc.) which makes it more expensive.
On the other hand, I'm not buying the never-had-to-do-a-chargeback argument. Chargebacks are a way the consumer can punish companies (y'know, fees, etc.), which makes the companies act nicer in order to prevent chargeback. Thus, because chargebacks *exist*, they are unnecessary. (Well, except when you consider stolen CCs, etc.)

Here's what would basically be the worst-case scenario:
 * CEX.io gets enough ASICs to have &gt;50% of the mining power.
 * The government tells them to shut down the bitcoin network.
 * They comply; the bitcoin network is shut down for a long time.
This can potentially be solved by, say, switching mining algorithm. However, that would have a lot of negative effects:
 * Miners will invest less money in mining equipment, as they know it might become worthless. This makes a &gt;50% attack easier.
 * The attack itself will hurt cryptocurrency for a long time, possibly destroying trust in PoW forever.
 * A huge update would be required, which effectively means the network is unusable for possibly days or weeks.
 * It will cause a lot of ideological problems. There will, for example, be insufficient review of the new code, so trust in the developers will be *needed*.
 * A lot of stuff we might not even have thought of could go wrong.

Suppose that to mine 0.25 xbt, it currently takes ~500 usd just in electricity. *If* that is the case, then it would take 500 usd to mine 0.125 xbt after the halving. This means that unless something else changes, it would be more profitable to buy bitcoins than to mine them. When that happens, why would you mine?
There are a few solutions to this, so to speak.
 * Hope that the liquidity is low enough that this will push up the price by a factor of 2. (or that there is some other way the price will increase by a factor of 2)
 * Hope that mining is currently very profitable (which is not what I've heard, but there might be stats I haven't seen available).
 * Hope that there comes an enormous increase in fees.

Not really. Suppose there is some other mining operation - say, a mining pool. They could contact that mining pool and trade their old Bitcoins for a subscription to newly mined coins from the pool. The other pool can (truthfully) claim that it is selling the newly mined coins for more, older coins, thus making its miners richer.

But what if you have a lot of Etherium whatevers, and start publishing computationally expensive contracts where you *almost* have enough to pay the fee? Also, how is the fee determined? The value of an Etherium whatever might change, and the fee should probably change accordingly.


My point was that this feature has nothing to do with Turing completeness. In general, you do not want powerful computational tools available on the blockchain, as that might make it very hard to mine.

Well... if the mining fees don't go up *a lot*, it will make the network exactly half as secure (in terms of cost of performing a &gt;50% attack), but pretty much exactly as stable.

As someone who knows the consequences of Turing completeness, that is the most stupid idea in history. What would end up happening is that they would put some obvious limits on the programs so that they are no longer Turing complete, because otherwise, it would be trivial to destroy it with a simple attack (for instance by uploading a non-terminating program). In addition, Turing completeness does not mean that you would be able to interact with the blockchain in any meaningful way, and as a concept, it is very rarely needed.

Yes, it should be treated like a currency, but log scale is essentially about the relative change of value. The relative change of value is the only change of value that is relevant, so if you're interested in the change of value at all, you should be using log scale.
For example, generally, when talking about inflation, we might say there is a 0.4% inflation rate. If this rate is held constant, it will appear linear on a log scale and inverse exponential on a linear scale.
Essentially, you should ask yourself why you are graphing what you are graphing. I have a hard time seeing any case where a linear scale is of importance.

What's important to me is that multiple Scalecoin chains can be created, as that allows better scaling.

Once they reach 51%, a 51% attack becomes more likely to succeed than fail. A 51% attack allows:
* Reversing transactions that you very recently made.
* Preventing other people from mining.
* Preventing other people from transferring btc.

I've been thinking of a solution related to that: what if we had a cryptocurrency (say, let's call it Scalecoin), where there are multiple Scalecoin blockchains, and where we can send coins between the blockchains (probably with some time penalty, as it has to be validated by both blockchains, and probably also a superblockchain or something similar).
Both of these solutions would unfortunately increase the probability of a 51% attack, as there might be fewer people mining on each block chain. The only way to avoid that would be some kind of mining compatibility. Also, I'm not sure miners could be rewarded appropriately with something like Scalecoin...
EDIT: Also, Bitcoin might not even be able to scale to a large city. I don't think multiple currencies in a single city would be too practical.

Not completely correct. A program runs in polynomial time iff there is a [polynomial function]( that, given the size of the input, can give you an upper bound on the amount of calculation needed to run the program.
Suppose the kind of cryptography bitcoin uses turns out to be breakable in polynomial time. It might still be that with the key size bitcoin uses, it is faster to do it with brutes force (i.e. a really slow method) than the supposedly fast method that runs in polynomial time. However, it would mean that if you increase the size of keys enough, you could only make it polynomially harder (instead of exponentially harder) to crack the cryptography. This might, however, require that the keys are so long that you can't store them in the universe.
