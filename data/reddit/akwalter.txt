Look at the apparent evidence.
1) All of the collapse last month was due to announcements from China. 
2) It sort of looks like China was driving a panic in bitcoin to shift volume their way.
3) The net effect as the price recovers will be that the U.S. and Europe will have lost many billions of dollars euros to China.
Could it be that a group of Chinese did what groups of traders in other countries often do, manipulate the short term price to profit?

Contact dropbox with the date range of the hack and they will give you the ips of the computers that logged into your dropbox account.
The same thing happened to me and they just sent me the following list of ip addresses that logged in to my account.

It sounds similar to something that I saw in 2007. I made a website about a place I worked at, dirtydetox.com, and noticed that pages that I had created but never linked to anything public were getting hits. There was no one who knew the pages were created and no way anyone outside the loop of my computer and my host/server could know the pages existed. 
Long story short that was my first experience with browser spies. In 2007 Google was using sneaky programs to absorb all the browser activity of users and then use that information, including I guess what links they visited. Much worse, the search engine baidu wasd actually trying to access password protected areas of the server using tricks that were pure scumbaggery.
In other words you probably have some zero day browser spy targeting bitcoiners.

Java. Use Firefox and then install the noscript add on and most of those problems will not happen.
Java is well known to have loads of undiscovered exploits.

Most people with 100k + bitcoins probably don't keep them all in one wallet, so it may actually be worse than the chart.
Maybe bitcoin is entirely spread between a few hypermillionaires and a couple dozen peope on reddit who are going to start shitting when one of the millionaires sells his stash to buy a little cocaine.

China is playing a ot smarter than you think. The net effect of various news from China over the recent days is a significant shift in bitcoin to owners physically in China. The Chinese sellers are visible, the buyers less so.

The net effect of this last dtring of news items from China is a huge shift in actual bitcoin to China at a lower price. Start calculating from there.

I never asked for BitCoins and I would rather return or donate them, especially if people are going to question my integrity. Just explain to me how.
