Ethereum does more than 3 times as many transactions as bitcoin a day actually.

Just google capital gains tax brackets. There are different percentages you pay based on your income and whether it's short term gains or long terms gains. It's that simple, just google it.

I prefer to leave the getting shit on part out when recommending this movie to folks, feel like it's the best bombshell of the movie and the way it's explained is hilarious when you don't see it coming.

Came to this subreddit to see people getting excited about more exchanges moving to segwit with Kraken and Nanex announcing adoption and lowered fees after Coinbase and Binance but there is not even a thread on it, weird.

They also have created a ton of tether since the subpoena, so that likely means they are mad men or legit.

Thank you! This will be the part all the articles leave out to turn this good news into some FUD lol.

All tor is not silk road LMAO,what is with people having no idea what they are talking about! You think offering prostitution and drugs makes you less of a freedom fighter? We all have different views on freedom I guess but why refute someone's point when you don't know anything g on the subject?

Haha right! This guys comment is hilarious, "doesn't seem like theres much evidence it was CIA orchestrated smear campaign". Yeah because the CIA is not a huge goverment orginization that has been doing things exactly like that for decades, but no I'm sure you would find plenty of evidence of their actions.......

You have no idea how the criminal justice system works based on this statement. Jesus I was going to explain why but I hate when people like you act like you have any idea what you are talking about. Your facts about Ross' case are incorrect and your knowledge on the use of evidence in a criminal case is incorrect, I will leave it at that.

According to the CIA, which never even charged him with hiring a hitman or attempted murder... they didn't even charge him for it in the end lol, let alone convict him. But yeah I guess innocent until proven guilty is an antiquated idea and I should also believe everything the CIA says, thanks for clearly this all up!

get-bitcoin.com(or .net) if there still around dont require id, bitinstant doesn't and many others i don't feel like thinking of right now, if anything there is more exchanges then ever that don't require id. I don't know what country your in but in the United States there is a law that purchasing any amount over 1,000$ in a day requires a form of identification, so split orders up that are bigger than that.

Whats your point? Then he can just pay taxes on the revenue he made, bitcoins aren't illegal. At All

What's that you were saying 26 days ago???
@_date: 2013-03-11 23:26:45
been pretty anonymous for me, buy bitcoins using site that does not require my personal information, have coins sent to wallet that does not require my personal information, spend coins. How is this not anonymous?????

Doesn't change the fact that it never lost all value over night, dropped to 5 dollars during the biggest crash that your talking about. Last time i checked 5 dollars is not 0. Any investment can lose all value over night, ever heard of Enron? It's only volatile because of its youth it becomes more stable all the time.

Don't feel like finding a source for you. Look it up, if you want to be a legitimate exchange that is completely legal then you must abide by the bank regulation "Know Your Customer" which paraphrased says: any deposit by someone into a bank to become a different currency must be done with the bank receiving certain personal information. This is only in the United States of course i dont know other countries laws only my own, which i can't say for everyone.
@_date: 2013-03-18 04:15:33
the currency hasn't been hacked, exchanges have. You'r a moron that doesn't know what their talking about. Trying to trash talk something for no reason, what a fool.
