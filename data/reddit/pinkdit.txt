Yes, seriously. 
If you ask me, Bitcoin has lost that revolutionary edge a long time ago. Lost in years of infighting and stalling. Now it's all about "Oh, Bitcoin was never meant to be this or that" (riiiiight), "It's about storing value" (ha, how's that working out?), "LN and segwit will fix it all!" (suuure!) ... while other cryptos are running circles around BTC in terms of usability. But that opinion is not very popular around here.

Then, as a journalist, you'll certainly know to quote sources, esp. if, as you say, you actually have any that would lend your "story" any weight.

What content-free non-news! Speculation plus wishful thinking, no facts. Hedge funds **could** jump in - or could stay out. They **could** also suddenly decide to donate all their profits to charity - or not.

Just ask anyone who newly entrusted their value to [Bitcoin during the last month](

Everyone here who isn't joining your choir is a paid shill, right? Oh, shut up already. Or at least show me where I can sign up to get paid!
I'm pretty sure santagoo's point wasn't to argue that BTC fees should be changed to become a % of transaction value. It was to say that $1.93 isn't exactly "cheap", especially considering what it used to be a few months ago before the blocksize issue hit the wall, thus countering NOLA_bitcoin's point which seems to be based on exactly that wrong premise, that fees are a % of transaction value. So now correcting someone is FUD and paid shilling? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:25:43
Santagoo's isn't arguing that BTC fees should be changed to scale with the the amount being transferred. It was simply explaining to NOLA_bitcoin why $1.93 isn't exactly "cheap" in general, especially considering what it used to be a few months ago before the blocksize issue hit the wall.
OTOH, many fiat transaction methods have fees that do depend on the amount - credit cards are probably the best example (processing fees to the merchant are typically a fix x cent base + y% of the transaction), but also Paypal, certain remittance services etc.

I think you misunderstand the meaning of the word "scam".
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:26:06
Like the US dollar was leeching off of the [Spanish dollar]( Knew it! Those Americans! All scammers!
And the Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders... don't even get me started on those crooks and their scam "dollars"!

Oh, you can totally have that! Without any usability in everyday life, it just won't "revolutionise banking for the developing world", which is what OP I first responded to asked about.
As for other coins, we can take that discussion to another sub. I have no desire to type out a convincing argument again only to have it shadow-baṇned by the local thought police. (yes, I'm talking from experience there.)

At a 10% reserve rate, they will lend out $10,000, not $900.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:13:49
Exactly! Pay an extra $20 in fees to put $100 on your Starbucks Lightning Network account! Sure sounds like an awesome idea. The masses will LOVE it!
Oh, easy, then just put $10,000 all at once on your Starbucks prepaid LN. Then a $20 fee is only 0.2%. Totally reasonable, right? RIIIGHT??
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:29:52
It's a flat rate. You pay the same amount in mining fees whether you move 0.001 BTC or 1000 BTC. How much you expect to pay you can look up e.g. here:  Scroll down for explanations.
And it's a problem with the Bitcoin network itself. The direct result of years of stalling in development and refusing to adopt intermediary scaling solutions because of stubbornness and conflicts of interest among some of the most high-profile Bitcoin developers. It's not something you can fix by moving to Bitstamp or any other exchange. 
You really only have four options:
* Suck it up, which might be ok if you're moving large amounts, so the fee becomes smaller percentage-wise.  
* Keep all your Bitcoin on the exchange and expose yourself to the risk of the exchange getting hacked, going bankrupt or running away with your funds. All that has happened before. Remember, if you don't own the private key, you don't own the Bitcoin. 
* Stop using Bitcoin. Exchange for fiat and cash out.
* Learn about some of the other cryptocurrencies and move to one you think has better potential because it has solved those scaling and governance problems.

Wow, that's great!

This is where a couple years ago, I'd pull out my phone, tell people to install a wallet fresh from the Play Store and just beamed a few "bitcents" (0.01 BTC) around the table. Done it several times.
It was an aha moment for everyone (look, no accounts, no registration, no ID required, no middle man!), shut up most doubters and made for a much more open and receptive remaining conversation. 
Yea, wouldn't you believe it, I didn't need lightning network for that. There was a time when Bitcoin itself worked just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:00:46
Fair enough, but consider how OP's scenario would unfold with small-block, high fee on-chain, low fee lightning network Bitcoin:
*"Hey mate what is buttcoin? How does it work?"*
*"Let me show you! Download this wallet*\**. OK. Now you find a lightning node in it."*
*"Lightning what?"* 
*"Oh, it's a second layer running on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to enable fast payments."*
*"O_O ??"* 
*"Yeah, don't worry, it's seamlessly integrated, you won't even have to think about it. Here is one. Now you open a channel with this node by committing some bitcoin."*
*"How do I do that?"*
*"You basically send some BTC to... oh, wait.... hmmm, maybe I can send you some bitcoin first to get started with Lightning Network. Tap here on Receive in your wallet and show me the QR code."*
*"OK, here you go."*
*"Oh, uhmm, looks like that would cost me 20 bucks right now. And we'll have to wait until tomorrow to continue. And then it would cost you another 20 bucks to open the channel. Which you don't have because I wasn't going to pay $40 for this little demo. But, but, you get how it works in theory, right?"*
*"LOL, mate!"*
*some future LN-enabled wallet

An iPad that his "family realistically can't afford". 
Even with free health care, I could think of a thousand ways to use that money in ways better suited for a family in this situation, than spending it on an overpriced brand gadget.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:03:14
The whole point of a decentralized exchange is that it can't be shut down. So, maybe it'd be illegal on paper. And then? How are you going to enforce that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:54:10
They are not listing it as Bcash because its name is Bitcoin Cash.
Just as forex markets don't list Canadlars because its name is Canadian Dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:24:50
Lots of ifs, but they don't change the fact that they can't afford it. And 0.1 BTC doesn't really change that either. 
Blowing what little money they find on imprudent purchases is a common mistake for low-income households and one of the reasons poor people stay poor. Have a look at r/personalfinance ...
For entertainment, even if it HAS to be a tablet (does it?) there are more appropriate options for a low-income family than an iPad where you pay half of it just for the Apple logo.

While it's nice for you to have some windfall "success", I don't like your story. 
Besides the fact that you use funds that technically aren't yours to use, as others have pointed out, I have problems with this part:


The 0.1 BTC isn't so life-altering to change the *"my family realistically can't afford a [iPod]"* part. And I understand you have free healthcare, but even so, I could think of a thousand ways to use that money in ways better suited for a family in this situation, than spending it on an overpriced brand gadget.
What about better or additional / alternative treatments for your mom, second opinions, private doctors etc. that are not covered by national care? What about tools or modifications around the house that make her life easier, depending on her condition? Or what about simply letting her decide how to best spend (or save!) her money? 
But looking at this 


Unemployed in 2013, so you weren't a student or teenager. And still scrounging money off your mom to go drinking? Selling your assets for a night out? I shouldn't be surprised by your choices in 2017.

A lot of people say the LN (lightning network?) is not Bitcoin and has severe drawbacks.

Don't "buy the dip". 
Buy the potential of cryptocurrency changing the world for the better. 
Speculators who only think about dips and peaks are going to be more of millstone around BTC's neck than helping it succeed.
