This kind of stories should make us all think. We assume that the bank is a trusted entity. But they can do whatever they want with our money. And if they fail... Fuck it, we bail them out.
In return I aspect them to deal my money with the responsibility and importance money have.
I only can imagine that I am traveling somewhere and I have no money I can access, because my account is frozen... And why?
Because a bank (maybe an employee) thinks, this guy did not response, so let's freeze his account... How dare he?

I can understand that. But what I can't understand is that they shut down my account without knowing if I know or not. I think that they can freeze a account without the consens of the owner, this is worrying.
If they only send a letter and if you do not answer they shut you down. I think it's a serious thing to do that and a proper way would be to call me or email me with that intention.
But no, they notify and the freeze the account, without me knowing it. No other business could do this

Exactly

Not able to access your account is a serious thing. My live depend on the fact that I can access my funds.
Why we should accept that a bank send a letter and there is where their responsibility ends?
If they had some common sense they would ask themselves : Maybe this guy did not receive the letter, maybe we call him to warn him (they call me all the time to try to sell me shit like insurence, stock markets funds, retirement plans etc). Why can't they call me for something that important like: "We are about to freeze you f account".
Sorry, but I am not agree that we as a customer have to live with that.

They do decision without your agreement about your hard earn money ... This is not right

Yeah, I can understand you totally. Thanks for the suggestion of the docu. Try to watch it this weekend 
@_date: 2019-03-20 18:43:03
That's exactly what they ask me to do. But one thing is spending your own money... The other is reject incoming money you need really urgent to pay your bills... Because of that... It's crazy
@_date: 2019-03-20 08:18:20
Of course, nothing is perfect. I never would bet all on BTC. But right now it looks quite better than the system we have now. To have 1 (not a group or collectivety) deciding that you are not able to receive money... This was my point. I think you can agree that a 51% attack is less likely than a bank entety shutting you down.
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:18:50
Already told them, they don't want to have anything to do with funny Internet money... (It's used by drug trafficers and terrorists, you know)

I am sorry... It might be legal, but I think it really questionable that a private entity are playing with their costumer like that. If they suspect anything tell the police, don't play police.

If you do not get paid in 3 month and you do not aspect this with your bank do this to you, I think that's normal to say "hey folk, please pay me". I did not insult them, I did everything the polite way. But it is annoying  if you need to pay bills. There are a lot of clients which do that all the time. So I think this is a normal reaction. Also they never told me that the money was rejected from my bank, till I found it out yesterday. So yes, I agree, treat your customers well, but they have to deliver too. And the first thing you think of (because there are a lot of clients who delay payments) is that they are doing it because of convinience.
The unusual thing is that your bank do that to you. And this is my hole point on this tweet. Banks can freeze your account if they want, even without you knowing it.
That's messed up
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:24:13
Sorry, call the police if you are suspicious... Now we are controlled by private entites as well? Why not put cameras everywhere to se if we behave well and score us if we are worthy to receive money at all... It happens already in China

BTW, 2 hours to justify it and than 48-75 hours to verify it, look also OK for you... Everything in the name of battle against terrorism... Even if our system is skewing us till we looses our last privacy and dignity... Yeah, we should accept that (irony)

Yes, everybody knows that a financial crisis is eminent and you are not the one to blame. But that you are waiting desperately to happen sounds very selfish. Of course there will be price action happening, but the way you are saying it sounds really selfish. I do not know if you aware that this is really bad for a huge part of the population... People will suffer the consequences and its going to be ugly.
