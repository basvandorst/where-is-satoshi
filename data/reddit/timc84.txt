Don't memorise the seed. Use a BIP39 passphrase and remember that instead. You can use an infinite number of passphrases and they lead to different wallets so you can have a couple of gimmes incase your forced to reveal a passphrase.

The Bitcoin block time is 10 minutes so using a hardware wallet you add one more hop before you can sell.  You gain an huge security advantage with a small delay in sending to the exchange.  If you leave your coins on an exchange ready to sell you have a massive security risk for a very small potential time advantage.  Not your keys not your coins.

Coinbase is fine for buying and selling. But once you've bought you should withdraw your bitcoin to a wallet only you control. Otherwise you're trusting coinbase to not get hacked and to allow you to withdraw later. Not your keys, not your coins.

Yes, if your wallet makes a receive address then you can receive on it forever &amp; many times.  No other wallet will ever make that receive address.  If you spend from that address it is best practice not to reuse it as the public key has been revealed.  [

BIP47 
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:25:09
Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain.  The hardware wallet stores private keys that allow transactions to be signed.  The computer asks the hardware wallet to sign transactions so, in theory, this can be done offline.  For you to move some Bitcoin you generate a transaction like ("Please move amount X from me to them"--Signed by me.).  You can generate this offline using Electrum.   This transaction will take some space so to incentivise the miner to include your transaction in a block you pay a small fee in satoshi per byte.  Now you have a signed transaction probably as a QR or hexcode.  You can broadcast it to the Bitcoin network using most blockchain explorers (EG [ 
A hardware wallet like coldcard has a really good flow for offline transactions including writing them to microsd card [ | [
The advantage of a hardware wallet is that the private key is never exposed to the computer.  I think it's generally safe to use a hardware wallet with an online computer.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:32:24
Personally I would:  Buy a hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger.  Generate a new seed phrase and pick a strong passphrase.  Then put the xpub into an app like samourai sentinel which is a watch-only wallet.  This will allow you to generate new addresses, one per job and watch the wallet with no risk of spending.
I think a hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger nano is worth the $50 for the security.  Buy direct from the manufacturer.  Alternatively you can generate a seed (offline) using [ &amp; and some dice or other entropy.  (And [ for passphrase).
It's a good idea to use a passphrase with your seed phrase.  Each passphrase gives a totally different wallet.  [
The master public key for the wallet is safe to use.  But you should not share it with anyone.  Given the xpub and a single private key from the wallet then its possible to reverse all the private keys and empty the wallet.  [
btw/ Cool idea!  I spend about £20 per week on dog care.

Buy &amp; hold. Make a spreadsheet to keep track of your cost average. Don't keep your bitcoin on coinbase. Time to buy a ledger nano or trezor.
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:49:43
I have both ledger and trezor.  They both work fine.  The find the UI (eg wallet.trezor) a lot better than ledger live, especially for passphrase accounts.  If you want to use lots of passphrase hidden wallets then trezor.   If not or you only plan on using the default wallet + one passphrase then ledger is good.  Trezor is open source which is what first attracted me.  If you plan on storing lots of different coins then trezor is also easier than installing 99 'apps' on the ledger.

Sure, you plug the opendime into your computer. It'll appear like a flash drive. Open the index.html file in a browser for instructions. A new opendime needs ~250k of random data to generate a keypair. Just copy some random files on. When it has enough the opendime will reboot, the files you added will be gone and the index.html will have the receive address. It will also show instructions to verify the opendime controls the spend key. Now you can transfer bitcoin there. The private key will be safe and secret until the end of life chip is popped off, after that the index.html will show the spend key only. The advantage is that it's simple to use and give away. The disadvantage is there is no way to back up the private key without popping the EoL.

The e-ink display is working really well.  For software I've written a basic script that checks all the addresses on the xpub (bip44) and shows the first one with 0 balance.

Buy a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s or trezor one.  Generate a new wallet and carefully note down the 24-word seed.  For example write the seed down by hand in a letter explaining what it is, the value of bitcoin today, etc.  I recommend not using the default wallet but instead use a strong passphrase, links below for trezor and ledger.  The passphrase could be written on the seed letter, or stored separately for increased security.  The bitcoin cannot be moved without the seed AND passphrase.
 [ 
 [ 
Next generate a master public key (xpub), info linked below.  This allows you to generate all receive addresses from that wallet with no possibility of spending.  You can use a watch only wallet like Samourai Sentinel.

 [ 
Verify the hardware wallet and sentinel agree on receive addresses.  Test receiving a small amount.  Finally reset and test restoring the seed + passphrase.  If everything is good the letter can be stored and the hardware wallet can be finally reset.  I recently gifted a small amount of bitcoin to a relative's baby using this method.  Most gifts like this will get lost so I suggest writing the letter out twice and keeping a copy.  You could include a copy of The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous.
