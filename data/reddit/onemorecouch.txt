I'm not asking if I care.. I'm asking if a service can be provided for this.

Question: If I move my coins to another storage and I want to sell it, what's the process of selling it? How long would it take? 
I know for coinbase, they take days for cash transactions to go thru. I never had experience with transfering BTC to them so I don't know how long they took. Do you know what the best way to sell BTC from paper wallet -&gt; online?

Be correct. Magic The Gathering Online Exchange.
God I get so angry whenever I think about how so many people trusted a card exchange website.....

I'm not saying no one is questioning them. I'm asking why in the beginning EVERYONE was doubting them, but those posts have died down and only the MT Gox remain. Both of these scum organizations used the same BS excuse to jack a lot of BTC so I'm just asking why no one is busting SR2's balls anymore.
I got that from a search about SR2 for the past week/month on reddit

You must not know anything about finance.... If they are all inflation proof then no body would be complaining about it now would they?
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:24:59
with .003 bitcoin, you should put the cash into something else...
any trading with &lt;$5000 just isn't practical.

Price has been flat for a long time now. From 820 flat -&gt; dive -&gt; 620 flat
I suspect this turmoil is gonna cause a long flat period until all the dust clears up. 
I'm scared of a step down graph coming up tho... 
IE 800 flat -&gt; 620 flat -&gt; 520 flat -&gt; 320 flat -&gt; whats bitcoin again

If you knew that then you would never have written that Mt Gox was an ultimate exchange destination. My only problem with your comments were that you clearly didn't research enough about it yet you accuse everyone else for trumping up mtgox? anyone with any research ability could've seen mt gox was a sham from the get go. Come on LOOK AT THEIR NAME LOL
I think the tumble is great news. Time to buy when uninformed people are selling off from the Mt Gox news.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:34:33
I wasn't talking about BTC, I'm talking about your lack of research making you think MT GOX was the ultimate exchange. You then accused us for not admitting to any fault, but in reality, you should take your own advice and just admit you had no clue MT GOX were ran by a bunch of Dungeon and Dragon nerds written with PHP = NOT THE ULTIMATE EXCHANGE

To be honest, Taiwan government and business really follow what the Chinese and USA Government and their businesses decide on. They followed Chinese decision last time to "ban" bitcoins. Taiwan really isn't known to make policies outside of the norm in Asia.
(I'm Taiwanese so I know how our government operates)

, which comes off as Jim Jones-ish and further makes me hesitant to deal with a currency that is supported by a crowd drunk on blind optimism and refusing to acknowledge the reality of negatives associated with btc.
Then don't. 
Also I never knew my opinion is everyone's opinion. Thank you for holding my words so highly :)

I dont think its about the amount but about scapegoating everything toward MR
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:58:19
When it got to the reason why some transaction won't take transaction fees, it kind of lost me. I don't really understand that part. So when you pay exact amount of Bitcoins, it doens't trigger a transaction fee? But when there is change involved, it does?  
Am i getting this right?
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:33:01
Yeah, so exactly the fantasy football scenario. Would it be illegal to provide a service to allow these people to "contest" for the prize that they paid an "entry fee" for thru bitcoins. And then hold that money in escrow then pay it out when it ends.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:49:38
Jesus, how many usernames do you have just to do this for... what I'm assuming... fun?
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:35:25
400,000 Euros at 23? That's quite a bit at a young age. But you have the rest of your life to get that money back (a luxury a lot of people don't have)
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:10:29
Well it just dropped back down to 650 lol

The problem is that it is very likely they don't have the funds to repay all of their clients if they choose to withdraw.
We speculate that because months before the malleability problem, mt gox has always had large trouble/delays in giving cash back to their clients

Is the transfer from Mycelium to Coinbase Account instant? How long would BTC's appear in the Coinbase Wallet to interact with?
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:23:31
Now we did hit a 520 flat....................................................

Failure was SR getting seized. If they did indeed copy SR, MR probably couldn't have gotten thru.,
However, almost everyone questions Mark Karpele's claims about MR but how come no one is questioning SR2's??

MtGOX = Magic The Gathering Online eXchange
Research more please =)
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:32:01
So if I host an event to gamble with pet rabbits, would that be illegal?
And Yes in the US
It might sound funny, but if that's allowed, then maybe bitcoins can be.. lol
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:11:57
I never said I was looking for one.. I just had a genuine question that I was looking for an answer.. No need to be patronizing here.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:21:17
Your actions are exactly the same as the ones you're criticizing here... lol You were obviously uninformed if you ever thought MAGIC THE GATHERING ONLINE EXCHANGE is a reputable place that people though was the "ULTIMATE EXCHANGE" 
Just take your own advice and admit to your own mistake and move on =)

This is a very good article shedding some light on how the Chinese works.
I'm also Chinese (but from the other side of the Taiwan Channel =P) and this article seems perfectly plausible to me
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:59:26
That's actually a shit job. LOL enjoy working for such a mediocre pay for an intense job. You'll probably average out to 8 pounds / hour. Unless English Investment Banking Jobs are softer than American ones

On a Global level as bitcoin survives on the global internet
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:22:53
What I'm trying to get at is, even if they do outlaw transaction in bitcoin, do you really think they will have the policing power to file and arrest EVERY transaction made by an anonymous currency? I just don't believe governments can contain this without devoting a vast majority of their resources to monitor it (Maybe a new job to NSA??)
As Freejack said, pirating IP's has been outlawed since I dont know when but look how good they are at policing that....
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:42:03
Please keep in mind that a government can only shut down transaction within its own borders. When is the last time we've seen governments in the world that can cooperate on a level to effectively kill off "99%" of the merchants?
Even if they can effectively shut down transaction like China did, I can't imagine Western countries to shut it down as efficiently as China will do as the governments don't work like a single party states everywhere. 
My argument is not that the government can't do anything to stop it, they certainly can. But Being able to do something and actually doing something and produce results is a whole other story. No government in a democracy can be that effective in shutting down something underground without angering the common people. If they could then our american war on drugs wouldn't have lasted this long and zero illegal aliens would be in the country as opposed to the rampant problem we have today.

I see, thank you for the answer

I just feel like if I can see videos about the Syrian civil war posted by rebels in the mountains or caves, the government can't control it very well...
