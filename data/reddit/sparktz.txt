Do you like being kidnapped/mugged?

Well.. I mean yeah it is a crash... It is just likely that it will recover.

Really weird.. Someone just posted something very similar on the Litecoin subreddit:

Pretend that you bought $10,000 worth of Bitcoin.  The very next instant you sell it for $10,000, so you had no gain or loss.  You aren't going to pay taxes on $10,000.
Secondly, I'm not sure what you are trying to distinguish with it being "property."  If you are in investing in real estate, you only pay taxes on the gains when you sell the real estate (i.e., if you bought a property for $100k, spent $30k to rehabilitate it, then sold it for $200k, you would only pay taxes on $200k - $100k - $30k = $70k).

Split the difference.

Does the perilous current state of the environment not bother you?  Trump is going out of his way to further hurt the environment instead of help it at a critical time in our history.
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:12:14
If you don't think the environment is in peril, which has been corroborated by countless scientific communities, then there isn't any point in trying to talk to you because you are an idiot.

Can you comment further on the $1,000 premium versus $100 premium?  I'm not sure I follow what you are getting at.

Here is an interesting article on this topic:  
Basically, it could be due to South Korea's anti-money laundering laws.

What exchange do you recommend for buying the alt coins that you mentioned?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:10:36
This is interesting, but I don't fully understand.  How will Lightning make it where you can swap currencies without incurring a taxable event?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:02:04
Got it.  Very interesting!  Thank you for the education!
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:57:21
I definitely stated that from a US perspective. If you aren't from the US then it may not be true.

Could you please expand on the "F is jan, g is feb, h is March" part?  I don't see F/G/H on the link so I'm not sure what you are referring to?

Growing adoption and institutional money.  There was a 1 billion dollar transaction (purchase) today for instance.

Haven't experienced it myself, but I read that it is two weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:03:34
You thought that the price could never return to where it was 3 days ago?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:20:41
Don't forget that you will need to lay taxes on that.

GDAX paid the full fee for the transfer.  If you transferred X units of Bitcoin to Binance, you will have exactly X units of Bitcoin once it hits Binance.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:30:24
The good news is that the fees are getting cheaper since the price of Bitcoin is dropping (along with everything else besides Ripple)!!  Just kidding.

I'm a noob to the CNBC website and looking at futures in general.  Are they only doing futures for January 2018 right now, or are there longer futures that are out there that can also be looked up.  If so, how do you find the list of all of the BTC futures?

What is the best source to learn about ways to store under a paper wallet, hardware wallet, or offline wallet.  Being scared about somehow losing or having my BTC stolen is the biggest barrier to me purchasing more. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 02:03:41
Yeah they can never just take your money from you for no reason.  Oh wait... what was the article about again?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:59:57
It is called a 401(k) because that is the reference to the section in the law that defines it.

The concept that Tesla is employing is common across many industries and covered by introductory economics classes.

Shhh.. let him keep going with his extrapolation... get out of here with your nonsense about how much money there is in the world!
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:02:57
You don't get the coins until they get your cash.  If they didn't do it this way, people could scam them by buying coins, withdrawing the coins, then when Coinbase tries to withdraw the money from the users bank account  the money isn't there.  By waiting until the funds fully clear, they at least still have the coins if the user doesn't have the money, which mitigates their losses.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:42:54
And now it is even.

The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:22:01
Yep on January 1st you get your BCH.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:56:13
But then how do you measure coins that have no fees?
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:33:47
It might not be in USD?

This sounds like... supply of Bitcoin ATM rises..

Eh, it depends.  My BTC position is less than 1% of my NW, but I still check the price many times a day.  It's just exciting to watch.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:27:36
I'm coming up with $165M.
100 * 1.04 ^ 365 = 164,880,328.51
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:13:37
Can someone enlighten me on why these are popping up?  They are more expensive than just using an exchange, and you have to go to a physical location to use it.  What is the purpose?  (genuine question)
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:41:50
I just purchased a Trezor.  Is it now obsolete?  Should I cancel the order?
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:20:34
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:53:35
Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:26:58
I bought (some more) at $5,845.  No worries.
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:17:04
Yeah I don't pay any fees at all.  Use GDAX to set a limit order (just under the current price if you want) then transfer it out and GDAX even pays the transaction fee.

Only has to pay taxes on the gains when he sells.

Can you elaborate on replay protection?  I have my coins on a Trezor.  Are they in danger due to the fork?  Or only in danger if I do something with the 2X?
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:55:43
Or you know pepper spraying the cashier.
