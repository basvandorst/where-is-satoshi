Right. In theory, it should. It too can be corrupted.

I'm not even sure actually. It just seemed to me that it was a do-this-at-your-own-risk thing until they fix it.

[Their blog]( seems to be hinting that it's just a bug they are working at fixing and that it will be up.

Physical reality. But there is quantum reality. I don't know much about it but the maths are all kinds of different and describe a reality that's very different from how we perceive it.

Apologies for the noob question: what's a reserve currency?

Well, our current science states that physical reality's "stuff" is also finite. The smallest length being the Planck length. Pretty damn small but still discreet. Quantum physics may be continuous, however how we perceive physical matter is thought to be discreet.

These posts ar almost outdated as soon as we see them. 2800 in sight!

Okay, this guy may be lame, but quantum organic chemistry is actually a legitimate field of science. The Royal Institute in England has some great lectures on YouTube about it.

I suppose that is one point of view. But the aspect of "wave function collapse" indeed is attributed in causal relationship to what we see as matter. The math is telling us that the collapse of the probability is where matter comes from. Therefore since reality is created by this, it therefore too must be reality.
