That's a contradiction then. If the convert from BTC -&gt; BCH is a taxable event, then taxes must be paid on that event, right? Otherwise converting would not be a taxable event.

Why would GDAX do this for free?
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:41:40
I would also like to know the answer to this. If I submit a zero-fee transaction, won't there be no incentive for a miner to process my transaction? Why would he pick my tx over another one with a tip attached?

What happens if an alt tanks after converting? Example: I buy BTC, shapeshift to BCH, then BCH tanks to $0. Do I need to pay taxes even though I'm at $0 of total value?

Some countries don't use their own currency and use USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:55:56
They're not going to be for it if they think it'll hurt their wealth in any way. They're the ones that actually added tax incentives for buying a frickin private jet. They only care for themselves. No way they'd be all for it if it means their mutual funds aren't going to perform as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:28:26
So to be clear, converting from BTC -&gt; ALT isn't taxable as long as the alt isn't cashed in for USD?
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:55:50
That's the point of it. If you use cloud backups, you're converting 2 factor authentication to 1 factor. Google disables device backups on purpose. Google knew what they were doing. They did this intentionally. If your phone dies then the codes need to go with it. You're supposed to write down your backup codes for recovery purposes. You're not supposed to back them up to the cloud.
If somebody gets a hold of your cloud backup, then you're toast. That's all anybody needs to compromise all of your crypto. The chances of somebody compromising your user id/password AND physical phone or paper backup codes are very slim.

How much does it cost to use LN?
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:13:23
Never. The government would never allow USD to be taken over by crypto. That aside, services like google wallet are faster, more user friendly, and free (which includes no fees).

In either case the gambling addiction is the problem. Online or not, it doesn't matter if a person has a problem. 
Your making it sound like going to a casino is this huge life event. Casinos are right around the corner. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:23:44
Smart contracts can do nothing to solve this problem. A middleman (ie PayPal) is the only way to solve this. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:51:15
If someone is that addicted to gambling, it doesn't matter. They'll make a trip to the nearest casino and blow it anyway. 
I'm all for people making their own decisions. If they want to blow their life savings that's their problem.

Writing down a backup seed on a piece of paper isn't hard to do. If you lose or destroy your phone isn't not a big deal to restore it if it's lost.
That said, yes, I agree it's easier to recover without using 2 factor (obviously). But if you don't do this, your data is only protected by 1 factor authentication. This makes your account even more vulnerable to theft. 
2 factor isn't needed on everything. I wouldn't bother with 2FA on a throw away Reddit account. But for Coinbase, google, or a bank you might want to think about protecting your accounts more seriously - otherwise you could be out a lot of real money. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:54:11
VISA transactions authorized within seconds. If I use a cancelled credit card, the CC terminal lets me know the transaction is declined near instantly. If the card is good, it goes through. Immediately after I purchase something, I can see the charge on my account online.

They will reimburse the fees charged by your CU, but not the other banks fees.

Chase has the largest network of ATMs out there. That means if you ever need to use an ATM, you're more likely to not have any fees if you use a chase machine. They also have 24/7 phone support, something you won't get from a CU.

I really don't understand how these mistakes happen. Don't people test and validate before making huge changes like this (moving large sum of BTC to another wallet)? 
I feel like I'm in the minority when it comes to not being careless with, in this case, hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Coinbase just blew its load. It's now $10K. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:03:18
&lt; $100 is the cost of getting into bitcoin, which *will* certainly be worth billions.

Of course not. People are only in it to get rich. If there was no money to be made no one would care.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:03:07
That could work. But in addition to that, put an encrypted backup on cloud storage. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:30:02
The government can't shutdown the network, obviously. But they can make a law to make it illegal to use. If they did, there goes coinbase and all other exchanges. It'll also make most people paranoid about sending/receiving btc, causing them to stop. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 06:07:45
I understand what you’re saying, and generally that could be true. But what happens when fees hit a point like they did in 2017 when they are $30 for a $5 purchase? Even if the product is free, it would still be too expensive.
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:29:47
It’s too risky, you can lose your funds if you encounter a hardware failure.

You are not liable for any unauthorized transactions. If a thief “drains” your account the bank will give you the money back.
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:14:02
It’s pretty cool you could buy pizza with crypto, but it sucks the fee was so high. I know people that will avoid using their CC if the merchant charges a $0.50 CC fee. 
For me, I buy 5 things a day, that would mean $1/day or $30/month in fees. That’s a bit high.
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:20:03
It's too volatile for me to do that. If I knew BTC was almost certainly going to be worth $X dollars, and enough merchants I shop at accept it, then sure, I'd be all for that. We're just not at the point [yet]. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:47:43
If you don't setup those weak recovery options, you don't have to worry about that. Google doesn't force you to give a backup email. On my accounts, the only 2FA options I have setup are: Google Authenticator, google backup codes, and google prompt.
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:07:48
Why not use google pay? I'm sure everyone inside the company can use that way easier than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:19:51
Do you really think the US is going to allow the US dollar to be crushed by bitcoin? As soon as bitcoin becomes a threat to USD I can assure you they will make it illegal, which would kill the value of BTCs price. The majority of people out there will not risk going to prison to use btc. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:09:23
This seems like one of the most logical next choices. Or a similar service like google pay. Making a jump to bitcoin for something like this seems strange. Especially when other options are free.

Just buy with it and replace. What I do is, if I want to buy 500 pizzas for 1 BTC, I'll pay in BTC then immediately buy more BTC. No matter what I pay the same amount, and I still have the same amount of BTC at the end of the day. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:32:11
I've already invested the max I'm comfortable losing. If I do that I'd be at risk exceeding that amount.

Won't buy a pizza with fiat, but will pay someone btc who pays in fiat. Makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:17:53
You're not scheduling a payment in the future for a specific date though. When you submit a low fee transaction, you have no idea when/if it will confirm. It's one thing if you submit a transaction for 1 sat/byte and know with certainty it'll take 6 days, but there's no telling if it'll confirm in 2 days, 30 days, or never. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:53:43
Let's assume he sold and bought back into another crypto, then had his seed stolen. Is he screwed (from having to pay taxes still)?
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:58:07

@_date: 2017-09-21 15:22:40
Edit: wrong thread. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:53:42
If you're going to that level, that's not even entirely secure since it's possible for a computer not connected to the Internet to be hacked remotely.

How do you figure that you're defeating the purpose of a ledger if you type the seed words and encrypt them?
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:15:17
It would if the transaction would be guaranteed to confirm in X amount of days. There's no telling when/if a transaction will confirm.

Would you say it's impossible to create an encrypted backup of your seed on cloud storage?
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:52:42
Now you have two points of failure for a single backup. It's essentially a raid 0 IRL.
Encrypt the seed with a long unique password, protect your google account with 2 step auth (google authenticator) get rid of any and all 2FA account recovery options (phone number recovery, security questions, backup email recovery, etc.). Then upload the encrypted backup to google drive.

See it on the blockchain.info, is what I meant. 
Edit:  any explorer 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:31:35
It still comes down to users specifying fees, instead of the miners. I can offer X amount of fee, but it doesn't mean a miner will mine it. It works similar to buying a car from a dealership. I can make an offer to pay $1K for a lambo, but it doesn't mean the dealer will accept the offer. It would be best if it worked like Walmart. When you walk into Walmart and buy bread, they make a promise up front that'll it'll cost $1. I know with certainty as long as I pay $1, I get the bread. Crypto would work better if it worked like Walmart instead of a car dealership.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:11:02

Do you know if they pay a "high fee"? So that there's fast confirmation?
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:43:30
The green padlock doesn't mean it's secure. It means it's private. I agree with your point though, trust needs to lie somewhere. Even if you create a paper wallet offline, you still need (or should) backup your *encrypted* 24 word seed to cloud storage (which should be protected with 2 step auth). At which point, you'll need to trust the software to encrypt the data correctly, open source or not.
I know you'll hear a lot of people yelling, "no! Never put that online, ever!" But as long as it's encrypted with a long unique password, protected with 2SA, then you're probably safe. You're more likely to lock yourself out of your keys than some hax0r getting to them. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:53:39
They take care of the mining fee? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:27:43
I agree as long as they can be secured properly. Some people don't do this, so Coinbase might be a better option. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:36:50
I always pay more than the recommended fee. Why? I make maybe 1 transaction every 2 months (if that). I'd rather pay a dollar extra to be certain my tx will go through.
One time I made a transaction using the recommended fee, it was stuck for weeks. I'm never going to take that risk again. It was a nightmare. 
It's stupid how users specify the fees. It should be the other way around. I hope devs address this like the Litecoin team is. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:47:05
It's extremely important to have a recovery process for your keys. It's even more important to test and verify the process you implement actually works. 
It seems so many people create a wallet, or get a HW, send some BTC to it and call it good. You need to prepare for the worst and be able to recover in multiple ways for when a disaster strikes. 
I'm glad you were able to get your BTC back after that near death experience.

The NSA and other dedicated individuals can still get to your computer disconnected from the internet. That means it’s not absolutely secure.
Good enough security (in most cases, a hardware wallet) is what people should strive for.
This could mean a paper wallet for some individuals, but for most people it probably means a ledger or trezor.
