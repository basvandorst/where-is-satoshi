What's more interesting, I think, is that Kraken is fast becoming the largest EUR exchange. They're insignificant for XBT/USD trading, but they're the  XBT/EUR exchange (even though it's a US company). Mt Gox will keep dropping for XBT/EUR, and bitcoin.de isn't doing that well either (just look at this, it's ridiculous: 
Personally I really like Kraken, they have a lot of advanced trading options, and it's a legit US company instead of a vague exchange ran by some vague chinese guy through his personal bank account.

Hahaha your parents are awesome (if this story is true). No, of course they aren't scamming you, they're showing you what a dumb mistake you would have made if you would have been so reckless to invest everything in bitcoin.

The app by Michael Rochefort? I really appreciate his efforts, but:
1) I'm really not going to trust ANY third-party with access to my blockchain wallet.
2) The app is pretty bad imho. Tried importing a paper wallet, but every time I try to scan the QR, the app crashes. I also read it doesn't have 2FA.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:29:46
Probably the fact that this was known for more than a week now. The only difference is that they've moved out of beta as of today, and that orders are now executed 4 times per day instead of once per day.

Just look at how bitcoinstarter does it; you deposit they bitcoins on their wallet, when the project reached its goal, the author gets all the bitcoins. When it doesnt, it's returned to your wallet.

Yea, it's sad the people keep trying to intentionally destroy bitcoin by spreading FUD for their personal gain. They have no idea how much harm they are doing to bitcoin, just for a quick profit.

Euh, so this is just a ponzi scheme?

Except for that "mBTC" is incorrect. The correct ISO name for bitcoin isn't "BTC" but "XBT". So it should be "mXBT".
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:52:35
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:27:58
But they will also need to create a wallet for that, bitonic doesn't offer one. That only adds additional complications.

Speculation. No word from Gox and the 'insolvency' part has been removed from this statement.

They can provide a easy to use API for bitcoin and other services like escrowing, and just charge a lower fee for that (0.5% or something). I'd gladly do that. The bonus is that you only need to implement 1 payment provider. I need to implement credit card processing anyway, so if they can handle the bitcoin processing for me: great! Saves me development time.
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:53:48
Well... All of them all just cheap ticker apps. There isn't even a wallet app (well.. actually there is a third-party app, but besides the fact that I don't trust that, it doesn't even work).
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:29:15
Kraken is an exchange aimed at forex traders, not a wallet-like exchange that is intended to be easy to use. I love Kraken, but I DON'T recommend it do 50+ yo people who just want to do some shopping.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:12:11
I don't know, but it sounds like it's just the fault of the users having very crappy passwords. E-mail 2fa isn't going to help if you're using the same password for everything, they'll just have access to your email as well. It's pretty typical that it happened to the same user twice in 1~2 months. To me that just sounds like that particular user (Jeff) has a virus or something on his PC an didn't take the correct security measures.
As for the API key: hiding it better isn't security, that's security through obscurity. Any cracker will know where to find it, even if it's 'hidden'. I don't know much about coinbase, but changing the permissions for an API key should be protected by some defense in depth, meaning that you'd need to enter your password + 2FA again to change anything.
I'm not even going to comment on the guys who didn't have 2FA set up, that's just plain stupid.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:28:58
So why would those millionaires use this? Why not just use bitstamp, bitfinex, kraken or any other exchange that doesn't impose these rules?
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:42:10
Nope it won't. There are 12.5 million bitcoins out there. How will only 30,000 bitcoins bring the price down by 70~80%? That's ridiculous.

Come on, we need a Windows Phone app. Windows Phone is pretty big nowadays (outselling iOS in 24 countries), but there is no way for us to pay with our phones :/
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:55:52
That's not crazy.
1) Microsoft tests the apps to protect the users from a lot of things. They test for security, they test for stability (if the app crashes during testing, they won't approve the app), they test for usability and consistency, they check if the app has any added value, etc. It just makes the marketplace better and safer.
2) Actually you can circumvent all this; that's called sideloading.

I can't find bitcoin on the site. Is it only for the US website...? Where do I find it? P.s., I've been using Etoro for almost a year now. I really love the concept. The only problem is that all traders on the site are complete idiots who don't understand anything about risk management, and the whole system is broken. I got 'out of sync' with parent traders way too often, leaving me with lost trades.
It's very nice that they offer bitcoin though, I still have around $500 worth of bonus money that I can't withdraw.
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:45:19
They do deal in ripples. Bought ripples there around 2~3 months ago. They're probably just out of stock.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:53:04

I didn't get the mail. That's because I opted out for mails like this, Etoro sends a LOT of spam if you don't opt out.

Where are they doing this if I may ask? The exchange you're probably talking about reached its trade limit, no trades have been possible for days.

I've been using Etoro for around 8 months now. While I love the concept it's really BROKEN. The copytrading feature works very very bad, lost lots of money due to bugs and stability issues. The traders on there are all gamblers who don't understand sh¡t about money management.
Overall, etoro.com is literally the buggiest, most broken website I have EVER encountered. I contacted support numerous times, but they simply don't even listen to feedback. Instead of fixing the important issues and adding functionality that EVERYONE wants (such as a stop copying new trades button), they're busy adding useless crap that nobody wants (badges, wtf?).
It is, however, still big news since they have like &gt;3M users (according to wikipedia).
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:57:54
I'm working on a trading app for the Kraken platform in Windows Phone 8. I created a crowdfunding project for this: 
Right now I'm working on some new functionality that allows users to view their balance and view their open/closed orders (screenshot: 
I plan to make this a fully functional trading app, where users will pay 'credits' for each executed trade. They will be able to purchase these credits through in-app purchases.
The app has received a lot of good ratings and good feedback, everyone seems to enjoy the app. If this sounds interesting to you, please let me know. I'm willing to pay dividend over the profits in exchange for investments.
You can email me at leoncullens @ gmail.
P.s., I'm in contact with Kraken/Payward. They really like my app and have no plans to release their own Windows Phone app. They might be interested in my app in the long term.

Hi, I would REALLY love to use balanced payments, I need the escrowing feature and the bitcoin feature. The problem is that I have a european business. I don't have a SSN, a US bank or an employee in the US. The US is my primary market though. Is there ANY way us poor europeans can use this great payments platform of yours?
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:11:53
Well technically Bitonic isn't really an exchange. It's just an online 'shop' where you can buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:35:38
Too bad everyone bought their coins at a premium because Mt Gox was about $150 higher than the rest when they introduced BTC trading.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:20:41
How do you know? What about: they simply dont KNOW about it? It started in the IT world, so IT people know about it. Women generally don't work in IT, so that's why didn't hear about bitcoin before it got a little bit more mainstream.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:09:27
Don't forget that 2/3th of all purchases in the US are done by, or influenced by women. They're insanely important for the success of bitcoin.
Unfortunately we have a LONG way to go. I mean... Look here at reddit, where people make comments like "women can make bitcoin too, by going to girlsgonebitcoin" and upvoting the shit out of anything that has to do with sexualizing females for bitcoin (like prostitution, cam sex, stuff like that).

The Netherlands is a pretty big country in the bitcoinworld, it's almost as big here as in Germany and France, both countries that have ~5x more inhabitants. We will soon have 2 real exchanges as well. The only thing where we lag behind are politics. Our politicians aren't as forward-looking as the politicians in for example the US.
