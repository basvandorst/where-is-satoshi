Will they even have time for this?
Donald Trump takes office on 20 Jan 2017. He promised to start mass deporting within 100 days. An estimated three quarters of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States are from Latin America. Most have overstayed their visas or came in illegally and entered the casual workforce without the necessary papers.
If we assume that 50% are male, and 50 of those are fit for combat, that gives us 11 x 50% x 50% = 2.75 million men who are either real men, or else simply deserve whatever is coming at them.
Seriously, I am telling you, not much longer from now, the American Federal Administration will have no time for anything, besides administering some kind of murderous martial law situation in which the severed arms and legs are incessantly flying around in the air.

Similar problem here. LBC is still usable, though. BitSquare is way less dangerous, though. LBC could actually do a runner, aka a full exit scam. The resulting mayhem would shave off 300 dollars of each bitcoin.

I am also not American nor in America. I am also on anxpro.com.

Andreas is a nice chap but he may think too much "within the system" and "in the box".
Our enemy, the KYC/AML FINANCIAL REGULATORS, use State-orchestrated power and force against us. By not attacking the enemy, we are making it too easy on them. It would be only fair to let them prove that they are willing to risk their lives and die for what they believe in.
I strongly believe in what Jean-Paul Marat (May 1743 – July 1793) did during the French Revolution, from his medicinal bath at home: Writing and publishing invectives to talk people into their graves by repeating incessantly WHY EXACTLY these people had to be terminated. Repetition helps! He even managed to write Louis XVI, King of France, onto the guilotine and then into his grave. 
KYC/AML FINANCIAL REGULATORS cannot do anything without policemen/cops to enforce their invented rules. So, guess who exactly has to die in great numbers now? Don't waste your time on the FINANCIAL REGULATORS themselves. Let's save a lot of time! Simply target the policemen/cops. They must die! Let's repeat that truth again and again! According to Marat's rule, repeating it often enough, inevitably makes it become true!

Jean-Paul Marat (1743–1793) was even soaked in a medicinal bath at home, when he wrote his famous calls in "L'Ami du peuple", "The friend of the people", and single-highhandedly convinced Paris to decapitate Louis XVI. He had to write his call quite a few times, but it worked: 
On 21 January 1793 the crowds happily decided to terminate FINANCIAL REGULATOR NUMBER 1, his Royal Highness, the King of France.
You see, if you decimate the cops, the FINANCIAL REGULATORS will have lost the power to enforce anything at all. They need the cops for that. Therefore, why attack the financial regulators? Just target and kill the cops instead.
In that sense, if you want to systematize the killing of cops, then, one existing method of making it happen, is to repeat incessantly that it MUST BE DONE.
Long live the the Marat method!

You can make killing if you are able to trade old notes for new notes at a discount, because you know someone in a bank who will take the old notes from you, in exchange for new ones, and cook the books about who exactly deposited the old notes, and who exactly withdrew the new ones. Bank staff are going to make a killing with this! They stand to make insane amounts of money. I guess that the old notes will initially trade at a 25% discount to the new ones, gradually moving to a 10% as old notes get traded in. The streets will soon be full of old-to-new note traders.

According to [Brandenburg versus Ohio](  395 U.S. 444 (1969), inciting to political violence is perfectly legitimate free speech. The USA would not even exist if that were not the case. Furthermore, if you follow and comment this discussion on behalf of a government agency, department -or contractor, you must clarify this. As you know, it is strictly forbidden to do what you are doing.

Cops are never valid military formations. Exterminating them is therefore trivial. Authorize the militia to advance in forward columns to storm any organized formation of policemen, by moving from cover to cover, and then kill them.

Mike Tyson is quite a recognizable chap. People won't forget easily what it was about, but you really need to elaborate the product too.
BUY bitcoin at your atm but not SELL? Does not make sense. If you implemented both, it would pretty much allow you to run your bitcoin atms 24/7 without having to attend to them. By the way, I make a living in bitcoins, and I spend some of them by SELLING them for US dollars or so, or whatever else the shops happen to take. So, yes, SELLING, not BUYING. So, where is my MTV. sorry, my ATM?
Another piece of information needed: How much AML/KYC hassle does it take, to do a transaction? Everybody I know utterly detests jumping through those hoops.

By the way, they already asked KYC/AML paperwork in the past. It's just that my account is now older than 3 months ...

The strategic offensive does not consist in retaliating directly against the FINANCIAL REGULATORS. As I have said already, just terminate the cops instead. Join your militia leader, seek out the cops, and kill them. Destroy any organization formation of policemen by charging at them. No need to occupy Wall Street either. Let's simply SAVE A LOT OF TIME.

I understand that you do not like the French Revolution? Read up on it! ;-)

To me, it is a one-way bet. With bitcoin understood to be antifragile, encouraging the crowds to wield weapons and turn onto the cops, is a surefire moneymaker. Every dead cop then becomes more money in my own pockets. So, why not cash in on their dead bodies?

I trade at anxpro.com, but I get emails from anxitl.com too. Not sure why. I just sent a mail to support about what is going on over there! ;-)
