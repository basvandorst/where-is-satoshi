Here is [bitcoin-ruby's fix for the malleability problem]( 
It creates a 'normailzed_hash' that is like normal 'transaction_hash' except it doesn't include the input scripts. 
Also included is a test to malleate a transaction.

Because it's really sha(sha(block + nonce)) where the nonce is a 'number used once' and is changed on every round of hashing

You can use libbitcoin-explorer (bx) in your terminal.
You can generate a standard word-list mnemonic:
    bx seed | bx mnemonic-new &gt; mnemonic.txt
edit mnemonic.txt to add your custom words (the number of words must be divisible by 3) then convert your mnemonic into an extended public key
    bx mnemonic-to-seed &lt; mnemonic.txt | bx hd-new | bx hd-public
you can then use the extended public key to look up your addresses in a watch only wallet.
If you want to spend you can use your extended private key:
    bx mnemonic-to-seed &lt; mnemonic.txt | bx hd-new
The 'mnemonic-to-seed' process is well documented and will be around in 10 years.

I've been running a pair of mainnet libbitcoin-servers for over 2 years now. They have never forked from the main chain nor mis-behaved in any 'unsafe' way. They were able to handle all the spam attacks when a number of the blockchain api services where falling down. This release makes it even better because a number of contentious locks have been removed, making for faster block validation. 
My service has signed thousands of transactions using libbitcoin-server supplied data and it has never faulted us.

When you setup your Ledger Ethereum wallet you are asked which chain you to use, ETH or ETC. I imagine it will be a similar situation in the case of a bitcoin split, upgrade your wallet app and choose a chain.

You don't need a 3rd party service to collect tips. You can put one of your bitcoin address directly on your webpage and people can send tips there.

The blockchain hasn't hard forked today (as far as i know). You might be mistaking a chain fork for a [git fork]( which only involves the application source code not the network consensus. A git fork can turn into a blockchain fork if a majority of miners or users adopt the changes and run it with their nodes. All changes to bitcoin happen via a [pull requests](

The bitcoin.it wiki uses [Mt Gox as an example]( but yes PayPal could be a trusted third party if they implemented a green addressing scheme. They most likely wouldn't because they are purely custodial in nature.

A more advanced version of this is the lightning network, which starts with a 2 of 2 multi-sig output to initiate a 'channel'. Someone always has to wait for confirmation though; If it's a deposit into a green address or a direct payment between two parties, deferring that wait requires a level of trust. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:53:30
The concession doesn't cut quite as deep when you combine it with CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY to remove the need for the third party signature after a period of time.
    IF
        2 &lt;Your pubkey&gt; &lt;Green Addresser's pubkey&gt; 2 CHECKMULTISIG
    ELSE
        "6h" CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
        &lt;Your pubkey&gt; CHECKSIG
    ENDIF
Imagine there is a bitcoin mall of the future where you can spend with 0conf to your hearts content. You walk in and send the funds you want to spend for that day to a 2of2 CSV address created with one of the mall's public keys. As you buy your items  you pay for it from your green addressed 'mall' wallet. The retailer lets you walk away immediately, 0confs, because they trust the mall not to double spend the transaction. When your day is done you can either ask the mall to send you back your change; or, if they don't, then you can wait for the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY time to pass and spend them all by yourself.

Wikipedia does not manage peoples money. There is a big cost difference between serving mainly static content (wikipedia) and providing financial escrow services. Are you using on-chain multi-signature escrow? Do you control the private keys?

According to [this calculation]( if the current block size remains in place, the size of the chain in 2140 will be ~6.6 TB. They have announced 12 TB drives for sale this year. Bandwidth is another question altogether.

You need to download the full blockchain to validate that your version is correct, but you do not need to keep the entire chain on your computer. You can run [Bitcoin Core in 'pruning' mode]( This will let you set a fixed amount of disk space to use. You need to make sure you are connected to the network often because if your node falls behind too much then you will have to re-download the entire chain again to fill in the missing pieces. 
If you are not pruning and the block size increases then eventually the size will get very large and maybe require disk technology to keep pace.

Your second output is un-spendable due to dust limits. You sent a single satoshi somewhere (0.00000001). The minimum you can send right now is around 0.00002730 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:17:06
That is true. I should probably add that my libbitcoin-servers only connect to the whitebind port of my own bitcoin-core nodes. I don't let them connect directly to network peers.

One 0conf method is green addressing with 2 of 2 multi-signature scripts. The first signatory is you and the second is a "trusted third party" that your payee trusts not to double spend the transaction.

You can only get the block time; but even that is not the real time, it's just the miners clock time.

The difference is that HW wallets are recoverable, while OD is not. A HW wallet is merely a secure mnemonic storage device, while the OD generates the private key on the device and never reveals it until the seal is broken. You can not make redundant open dimes with the same address.

You can do it with [libbitcoin-explorer]( but it's not an auto-magical point and click process, serious command line action is required.

It's really because of Canada's banks. They we're making bitpay use $1000 wire transfers as the only option for sending fiat to their customers.
