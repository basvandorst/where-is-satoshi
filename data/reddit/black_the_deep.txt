I held/traded my way to a few thousand dollars profit.
I would have made more if I had just held from the very beginning.
It is not a good secondary income, but it has been nice.

Step 1: Decide to mine bitcoin.
Step 2: Buy expensive mining rig.
Step 3: Come to understand concepts like ROI.
Step 4: Cry.

That's fine; nobody's gonna force you to.
Still, I accept bitcoin on my merchant site, have for some time now, and made a buttload of money doing so. I guess by your definition, money is technically nothing, too, so I guess I made a buttload of nothing. And this laptop on which I'm typing this post, purchased with the  nothing I made from selling things on my website for nothing, is also nothing.

Well that's funny, because I exchanged some of my nothing for gold, too.
Also, I think most dictionaries would disagree with you.

In order to more fully understand why your comparison is flawed, try cutting a Beanie Baby in half and selling it for half of the value of the whole item. Then cut it into 1000 pieces and see if you can sell each piece for 1/1000 of the value of the whole toy.

Of course. I believe in a diverse portfolio. I have some BTC... but it might not be worth anything one day, so I also have some USD... but it might not be worth anything one day, so I also have some JPY... but it might not be worth anything one day, so I also have some gold... but it might not be worth anything one day, so I also have some food and fuel in my house, and I have made it a point to acquire some useful skills.
