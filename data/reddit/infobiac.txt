Stuff like this always makes me sad, because it ties a relatively unimportant metric (price) to the overall "success" of bitcoin. Really, things like merchant adoption, amount of transaction etc serve as a much better judge, but people always refuse to see that...

I got to admit, I didn't see the point of bitreserve for a while: it's basically an exchange with higher fees. Having used it a couple times in the past week though, I'm sold. Perfect for short term holds of btc when I'm worried about the price/don't want to have to deal with slippage etc.

"Because this chip can mine both bitcoin and litecoin simultaneously, there are two sides to it. On the bitcoin side, it has 160 processing cores, while on the litecoin side, it has 125 processing cores."
So I think maybe it's basically two boards mining simultaneously? I'm confused as to why you would want this. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:06:47
Another reason why they won't do it: they think of it as a crazy cryptocurrency, and don't want to deal with it. I know payment processors aren't always the answer, but when talking to business, suggesting something like coinbase or bitpay where they NEVER have to touch bitcoin is a big sell.  Hell, both services would probably be willing to make this a "partnership" kind of deal (like coinbase+overstock), where they'd actively help with the implementation process themselves.

I've been using them intermittently for some time and it used to work pretty much instantly; recently, though, it's been taking a really long time. Must be a new change.

Sorry buddy, that literally is his point. He's saying people will hold onto it for the future rather than spending, because they think it'll be worth more.

Don't mine bitcoins. Period. Bitcoin mining is now in a stage of corporations, where giants like btcguild and Asicminer duke it out. Even buying a USB Asic miner for 8 bucks, which is the cheapest I've seen it for, you're unlikely to return on investment by most estimates. If you have a spare gpu lying around, mine something else and then convert it to bitcoin. Try to do something scrypt based so you won't be competing with asics. Check out coinchoose for the most profitable. Feel free to pm me with any questions too.

They've got a 30 day holding period don't they? Also campbx prices are still quite substantially lower than gox for now so as a seller there will be a slight hit.

While I agree that value doesn't necessarily depend on adoption, adoption  WILL undoubtedly ultimately make or break bitcoin. The argument about gold is fundamentally flawed - at one point gold was a major currency in many parts of the world. We only view gold as having value because of this; EVERYONE sees the value of gold (vestigially) and so the price remains consistently high. If no one adopts bitcoin, bitcoin will eventually fizzle out and become worthless. In order for bitcoin to be like gold, there has to be greater adoption first.  So if you have bitcoins, SPEND SOME OF THEM. Not all of them. Just a couple here and there to let merchants know you're fully behind their decision to accept bitcoin. That's what I do anyhow.

If you're asking about why many bitcoin users are so charitable/bitcoin seems to have a generous community (looking at Sean's outputs and reddit tippers), I think it's because we as a community want to prove that we aren't all scammers and drug addicts. Regarding bitcoin as a medium for giving, I think that it is rather unique. While bitcoin is anonymous in some ways, it's super traceable in others, which keeps things transparent. I can see my money get to Sean's outpost when I send a coin. In the future, when more merchants use bitcoin, I'll be able to see how nonprofits spend their money too. I could see them send coins to the known address of a food wholesaler for example. It'd force nonprofits to cut down their bloat. So yes, I do believe that bitcoin puts us in a unique position regarding non profits. As for the homeless people using bitcoin, that just demonstrates another point of utility: microtransactions. But that's a whole other story so I won't get started on that...
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:02:07
Actually... It kind of is. Search results aren't worth that much to anyone.

They won't ever be worth much if people don't spend them because with no spenders there will be no adoption. With no adoption, bitcoin will eventually fizzle out.

What I would do (and in fact am planning to do with an iPod touch) is just install google authenticator or Authy on it and lock it away. I have around 9 codes associated with bitcoin on there right now that I am in constant fear of losing. Even with authentication keys and being able to contact support, I like to be safe when it has to do with my money. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:36:22
Just the API. Bitcoincharts was having a similar problem.

This. It could very well be a scam. There were certain random capitalizations and weird grammar phrasings; while it could just be routine mistakes, I'd be careful.

Even litecoins aren't very profitable at all these days.  Check out [coinchoose]( to get an up to date profitability chart.  There are also utilities (like [CGHelper]( for [CGMiner]( that will switch to the most profitable one every so often.  Still, the best way to make money off bitcoin is to just buy some and wait for the price to go up in the future.  Unless you're willing to make some capital investments, mining is not really advisable.  Check out [bitcoinx]( to get an estimate on how much you'd make.  Keep in mind that this is using the current difficulty though; as difficulty exponentially increases, your profits will exponentially decrease. Things are a little different if you spring a couple hundred dollars for a nicer GPU and do scrypt mining, but not a whole lot.  Of course, you could just mine for a couple satoshis, lose out in the near future due to power costs, and make it all back later if/when price goes up.  Anyways, not sure if that all makes sense; I'm not a real expert, but feel free to PM if you ave any questions.

It's "European". The quotation marks felt necessary. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 06:36:50
While I understand this, I do think that it's mildly contradictory because many people use the fact that there's no chargebacks as a selling point when trying to get people to accept BTC. Really,  I think a more effective escrow process is the answer rather than credit cards.

This is the attitude that's killing bitcoin. Bitcoin is for everyone. As users, we should take it upon ourselves to explain bitcoin. I for one love it when someone asks me this question, cuz then I can rant on about the benefits of bitcoin.

Even if bitcoin isn't corruption resistant, it sure as hell makes it harder. Anyone could see precisely where any politicians bitcoins are going. Any politician using a mixing service would obviously have something to hide. Of course it's not full proof if money is sent to a new wallet every time, but it does increase difficulty 
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:55:56
Could someone explain to me why this is? Once it took 40 minutes for my transaction to go through, and I thought it was just me. I was looking through their FAQ and I thought I read somewhere that they included a transaction fee, so why is it taking so long?

Are you only selling? Because withdrawing via ACH is fine, its only trying to get money in that's a pain in the ass.

I have to agree. Often when I bring it up to people that are moderately techy they'll be like "oh those gold coin things?"

I personally don't get all the hatred altcoins get from many members of the bitcoin community.  Litecoin isn't just a knockoff of bitcoin; it is an attempt to address many of the issues bitcoin has (namely in miner specialization).  I also don't think that supporting one comes at the cost of supporting another; like silver and gold, there is room enough for both litecoin and bitcoin.

My answer to that would be that there are tangible benefits to Facebook - you can measure it's performance via its profits and user count etc. At the end of the day, Facebook stock has value not just because people are buying and selling it, but depends largely on the markers provided by Facebook the company. It's worth is (somewhat) external to the faith of its stock owners. Bitcoin, similarly, has performance markers in my opinion. I believe that these are adoption by consumers and merchants. If you remove this, bitcoin largely becomes a matter of faith. It has no inherent value besides the faith of its owners that it does. Which is great, but I personally don't think that trading alone makes it sustainable. So I think that the continued rises in prices is dependent on widespread adoption. Sorry if that's nonsensical; it's bedtime. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 06:55:50
There are really three good cash options: 
Localbitcoins - easy and probably cheapest but kind of a pain sometimes, depending on the seller
Bitquick.co - easy and escrowed so really safe too. You just got to scan the slip and they'll be released. 
Bitcoin-brokers - the best for large (400+) orders. 
I've used all three and can vouch for their integrity. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:27:58
Don't get me wrong. I used to love campbx and use it frequently. But lately... Money orders taking weeks to deposit, promised ACH that was first delayed by a week, then delayed some more with no explanation, and finally released to a closed beta, and support issues taking weeks to resolve... You seem to be one of the lucky ones, but you are the exception, not the rule. Check out the comments on their Facebook if anything I say seems false.
