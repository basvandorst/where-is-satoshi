I can't stop though.

It might at first...but that shit will fade and stretch and sag later.

Fuck. Have your stupid upvote.

You made the right choice...would you have made some money this time? Sure...but what you're describing has taken some bitcoin wallets from hundreds of coins to less than one. Don't try to time the market...spend time IN the market.

Setup an automated weekly or monthly buy. Never sell.

"The crash is happening..."
You either have no idea what crypto is all about or you're a troll trying to make people panic. Either way...stop it.

Day trading will typically decrease your bitcoin holdings.

If they didn't plan ahead with putting the seed or private keys into their will, those coins will just be inaccessible forever. The number of coins issued will never go over 21,000,000.

Because I believe in decentralization. BCH has lower fees and faster transactions RIGHT NOW...however, an on-chain solution like increasing block size isn't a sustainable scaling solution. You will see. The core developers aren't dumb...and despite what you're being told elsewhere, they aren't bank shills.

WTF is hold?

BTC takes the billions of people in the 3rd world who have never been able to have a reliable bank and jumps over that concept and just makes them their own bank. This technology will have the most impact in the poorest areas of the world.

Yeah, my money is locked up at Bittrex as well.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:32:34
234 satoshi/byte was the fee I set. Was that too low?

Setup a weekly purchase amount that you're comfortable with...ignore the price. This way you dollar average your buy-ins and the bumps level out a lot. When it dips, I usually throw a bit more in than usual, but no matter what the price is, I buy weekly.

I think his point is that you're assuming that will happen. There's literally nothing guaranteeing that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:38:45
Yeah, I really don't know about that. I will hodl, but I have a feeling some rough road is ahead.

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:50
Totally insane!
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:20:06
That's true...like Litecoin...or Nano...or any number of things that are better than BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:06:40
Don't try to time this market...instead, spend time IN this market. Just buy, hodl, and live your life regardless of what the price does. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Welcome to the fucking show.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:15:14
Buy always.

Paper wallets don't...you just print them out.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:08:17
Hardware wallets and paper wallets are good options. I like my Ledger hardware wallet. They are affordable and super user-friendly.
[Paper Wallet](
Follow the instructions exactly...don't generate it online. Once it's created and you've transferred your coins, store the paper wallet somewhere like a safe.

When I saw the dip happening this morning, I jumped on Gemini and my USD Balance was $0.12 so I knew I needed to add some funds. When I did a bank transfer, Gemini made the money available instantly for trading...It just has a hold on it for withdrawal...so I can't move that money out of Gemini right now until the funds clear.

I love my Ledger!

Switch to another exchange. There are far better options out there.
