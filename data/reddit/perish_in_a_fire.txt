Its quite clear that he's just trying to take the "moral high road" approach. You see, by *educating* people about Bitcoin, and more importantly, taking the adverse side **every** time, he can assuage his ego about making "safe" bets.
To predict something takes admission, that your prediction may not come true. On the other hand, picking apart things and citing faults is easy - and more forgiving, since you don't have to say whether it will bring the downfall of a system.
It is the easy way out for intellectual cowards to crow they are taking the "devil's advocate" route because they're here to "help".

Fucking Andreas.
Mark shifted in the tub, now half full of his preferred soaking ingredients. 
So be it. If this is the showdown, lets make it count.
The low flutter of a personal drone dropped a wireless keyboard into his wrinkled hands. Wiping off excess moisture from his brow, he focused until the only thing he could see was the freeze-frame of the Greek's forehead, preserved on his SAN in megapixel detail.
"You want to play? Fine, lets play."
PHP commands flew from his fingers, the rattling of the keys like bones in the crypt-like space of his bathroom.  The ro-butler whirled up, a silent query as to whether he wanted to accept the thick-weave towel it was presenting him.
"Fine. Accept."
Standing up, shedding the final droplets of the caffeinated bath as the ro-butler dabbed and prodded, until the towel formed a crude toga around his expansive body.
Keyboard still in hand, code flying from his fingertips as a droplet of spittle flew from behind clenched teeth.
"And it shall be so."
The fortress started to hum as the excess power capacity from the whirling mass deep in the basement achieved resonance.
"Catch, asshole..."
Fire erupted from the front stoop view, blinding the sensor.

The point here is - debt, in this system, will ultimately be its demise. And that isn't touching upon the other aspects that people have raised.

As someone who has more financial experience than some teller in a bank, I can tell you that most financial infrastructure runs on rather outmoded hardware. 
ATMs? WinXP machines, essentially - witness the hue and cry over Microsoft dumping support for that aging OS.
You also seem rather lacking in the area of the "heavy lifting" done by banking institutions. These people are not running cutting-edge hardware, they are still maintaining systems that are from the IBM age of machines.
Even the major exchanges are running on hardware that you would probably laugh in amazement at. Not that it doesn't do the job, only that it seems so "old fogey" to even consider the vendors that they do business with.
In short, your experience seems to be a fabrication compared to the rather painful reality that exists.

Option 1 - The scourge of Gox is finally ended, and the people foolish enough to trust a completely incompetent CEO reap the bitter rewards, learning a lesson that isn't repeated.
Option 2 - *(magic fairy dust which insures transfer of coins)*, then further idiocy that keeps Gox in the headlines, further damaging all association with Bitcoin. Futile attempt to create an exchange out of a shoddy codebase and ample ill-will by banks and former customers.

Bitcoin is just a tool.
If it makes government control of a currency come under the spotlight, showing the corruption and single-mindedness of its handlers, that isn't Bitcoin's fault - it's the fault of the government that is failing its citizens.
Criminals don't like it when people can see their work in broad daylight, corrupt governments don't like it when people can see how their currency is being used as a political football.
Of course, no one ever mentions that all governments have to do is clean up their act, because most realize the system is too entrenched for any single politician to have the will to lift their head from the trough of power, much less change monetary policies.

He only speaks to keep himself in the public eye. He says nothing substantial, its all for show. After selling his gambling empire for 126K BTC, he's been a bit bored in Panama, especially since the SEC is sniffing after his virtual IPO sale.
He doesn't have to be evil-incarnate, just enough of a sleazebag to seize opportunities like the Gox disaster to promote his "brand". No one asked him to, but he'll do it, nontheless - because he knows to be forgotten means he loses any leverage in the Bitcoin-sphere generally.

Gox is dead, and Mark knows it.
There's no reason to limit BTC withdrawals if they are "fine". None. Zero.
I don't buy Mark's stalling tactics, or his reasoning. He's concealing the fact that they are not in good working order by trying to prevent a "run on the bank".
Its about time Gox failed due to Mark's arrogance and incompetence - the fuel that his flailing exchange has provided to Bitcoin haters worldwide is an extreme hit on the public perception of Bitcoin.
Die Gox, you useless fucking exchange.

The dollar is already on the way out:
Higher interest rates will make it harder for the Fed to roll over the Treasury debt, and even if they cheat by some clever accounting, the net effect on the US GDP will be another extension of the current recession.
Its all lining up to be rather grim for the USA, but after abusing their monopoly for so long, it seems fitting they fade into the same near-irrelevance as the British Empire.

Looks like someone doesn't understand how large 2.1 quadrillion really is. That is the maximum number of units we're going to be working with after all the coins are mined.

DRM is crap.
Not even in the sense of pure principle, echoing the mantra of "information wants to be free", but in the sense of hoops that it makes the user go through.

It would be better to concentrate on distribution mechanisms versus how to restrict the everloving crap out of their consumers.

Bitcoin is non-traditional, and most decidedly not conformist when compared to the legacy financial system.
The legacy finance guys are terrified they'll miss the boat. If they aren't, they're going to be the ones crushed by the Bitcoin tsunami, smiling into the camera seconds before the beach is overrun.
Being ignorant isn't an excuse, it will only seal your fate. Bitcoin is not a scam, its a new system, and I believe one of the first genuine efforts of self-controlled destiny since a few upstarts sailed across the ocean to start a new colony.

By questioning their beliefs about money, *(And they are beliefs, most people don't have their facts straight)* you are poking holes in their consensus of reality.
You make them question the fact that they have a bit of paper/linen/whatever in their hand that is exchanged for stuff, and how fragile that perception is. Most initial reactions are to reject any idea that *their* currency will be replaced by something else.
That's fine, leaves plenty for those that understand how powerful ideas like Bitcoin eventually dominate.

You then ring-fence NYC by rejecting anyone coming from their ISPs. Since they are largely a cable-run oligopoly, that won't be too difficult to determine what blocks they are using and which ranges to ban.
You could have an "appeal" process where someone who thinks they are exempt can apply for getting access, but that would require some kind of geographical 'proof'.
In any case, this is a non-starter, and just shows how far up the ass of banks NYC really is.

I know, the credit card company should eat the loss, but the problem here is virtualizing access to your financials and basing it on a token that is also stored as a pattern of bytes somewhere on your device *(even momentarily)* is probably one of the most retarded things I've ever heard of.

Okay, since we have a **live one** here. I'd be happy to deconstruct exactly what that remark means.
What "Bitcoin is an experiment" means, in the most direct way possible is this:
By claiming it is "just an experiment", you're trying to **DISCOUNT ANY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY** for what happens with it.
And you know what? Fuck that shit. Contribute to the code base, make commits and do something with it, but you better **NOT** back away like you just saw something you couldn't deal with and call it an "experiment".
We're going to either make it, or *NOT*. And there are **LARGE** amounts, which abso-fucking-lutely **MEAN SOMETHING**, and *if* things go wrong, you can better believe that it won't be "well, they just said it was an experiment, they totally covered their ass", it will be "WHY THE FUCK DID YOU CHANGE WHAT YOU DID, AND NOW EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THAT MEANS YOU HAVE ZERO RESPONSIBILITY."
And as for my dreams, that doesn't factor in here, what factors in is the immense amount of effort and yes -- fucking money -- that has been invested in this herculean effort, so to fucking conclude:
Saying it is "an experiment" is just an effort to deflect personal responsibility, which is complete fucking bullshit.

Nation states are becoming obsolete.
As seen by "captured" governance across the world, nobody is getting their vote heard anyway. Its all being subverted and co-opted by the deepest pockets, in some kind of perverted oligarchy.
With the continued asymmetric war on "terror", which given its roots, will never just go away *(Until nation states dissolve entirely)*, and the financial drain on fighting such a war on a nebulous enemy with a multitude of attack vectors is foolhardy on any scale.
What replaces it? We will probably go through the same turmoil seen when feudal societies transitioned to other governance models, with the attendant social strife and the common man being caught in the middle.
The only saving grace will be the things that are designed to weather such turmoil, which is why tools such as Bitcoin are important, in addition to the decentralized nature of communication protocols.
Its just one step in a long journey away from the nationalistic hegemony we call countries to something completely different and more resilient.

The key difference between block rewards and this proof-of-stake system is the variance. 
If I mine, I don't have a guarantee that I'll get the next reward, unless I'm throwing out insane hashing power, and even then, variance will determine whether I get the next block, in addition to other factors.
In proof-of-stake, all you need is the funds - and you're set. That is what I object to, because you're externalizing something that should be meritocratic and essentially provably "fair". Having a pile of paper tokens you can burn isn't in that category, in my opinion.

Banks will always think like banks, which means top-down   hierarchal planning, design-by-committee, and as always - taking their "slice" out of the middle of anything marketed to their customers.
I don't expect banks to integrate Bitcoin at all, they'll drag their heels until payment processing becomes too large to ignore, then they'll try to co-opt the technology without contributing directly to the Bitcoin network. 
This could come in the form of their own Blockchain-esque experiments, using Bitcoin related tech in a "tokenizer" for internal payment/settlement, or other areas that could potentially reduce costs.
The problem is, given their mode of thinking and expansive infrastructure just to stay in the game, anything they come up with won't be able to compare to the "bare metal" that the Bitcoin network currently enjoys, which means they'll be priced out of the market they're trying to overtake.

The problem is "regulatory capture", and has been documented elsewhere - former SEC and CFTC heads going off to work for private companies, and back-and-forth with a revolving door in between them. 
There is no attempt to maintain any kind of airtight integrity, just job-hoppers getting off one paycheck to land a cushy gig somewhere else. The incentives are mixed, the regulation lax *(if it does anything at all, it benefits corporations)*, and anyone who does commit a crime never gets charged.
The problem with the Bitcoin Foundation is they feel engaging the system is the way towards the future. Sure, its the future of being co-opted and strangled by red tape and corporate-leaning policies.

Your mistake is assuming that someone selling is being penalized. Nobody forces people to sell, unless they have zero trading plan and get forced-executed at Bitfinex. 
Otherwise, you're following your plan, and if you get stopped out - that is the nature of trading. By absorbing that risk, prices are determined, and by that mechanism there is a market.
You don't bitch that you can buy chocolate and coffee at reasonable prices, do you? The same risk-transfer mechanism happens when large producers hedge price variability using futures contracts for those commodities.

I probably wouldn't admit this openly. Most people view Free-To-Play as a rather scummy move on part of developers. *(Unless they're on the receiving side of the funds.)*
As for your game, you can get started for $99/yr for iOS, so I'm curious what your real costs are for game assets and coding, especially if you use a cross-platform game engine like Unity or even the UnrealEngine.
The title is also misleading because you don't even have a fully fleshed-out design document going, just a few discussions on core mechanics - far from what is implied, that there is a working demo or something finished.
You may have wanted to wait on this announcement until you at least had a simple demo to show.

Charged? Not really. They've made a mistake, and have paid for making that mistake. Just like dropping your wallet in the street, or not noticing a dropped 20 dollar bill.
Banks will gladly take your money, because that is their business, taking your money - making sure they generate enough fee income for holding on to your balance *(which you can't pull out in its entirety if you wanted - go ahead, try to get your whole balance without jumping through hoops)*, not to mention tacking on new rules whenever they feel like it.
And lets not forget the potential for confiscation, as many startled safety deposit box owners were when they decided to confiscate gold. They could do the same for Bitcoin, just because.
Your support of banks is rather transparent, so I'm just going to call it - You're either a direct employee, a paid shill, or your logic is so bad, you can't see any of the points I'm making.

The irony here is, when it was preventable, everyone took two big handfuls of Erik's gambling shit sherbert, and asked for seconds - so grateful that he was providing a "service" at the expense of everyone else.
Fucking spineless fluffers, all crowding in to be the first to administer the lube and ask him how he'd like to have it tugged.
This "community" is nothing more than a mouth-breathing popularity contest, glorifying the most base elements of human behavior.

"Belay that order."
His voice reverberated off the polished marble, gold bath fixtures misted with steamed frappacino dripped mournful drops of water.
The ro-butler paused, about to whisk away to the service entrance out to the rooms beyond. The cat was chipped, so it would be trivial to find.
"Bring me the remote."
Servos whined, and an oblong plastic square was deposited into his outstretched hand, wrinkled from soaking too long.
One whole part of the wall slid away, whispering on jeweled bearings. It wasn't easy, building this fortress, but it would have to do until he could get to the mobile command center.
The large screen lit up, partitioned into a checkerboard of security cameras, some glowing with the off-green of infrared enhanced vision.
*Did something just move there?*
The largest view showed the front stoop, hidden behind a rolling garage-style door layered thickly with corrosion and badly scrawled kanji.
It couldn't be, it couldn't...
Shifting in the tub, he was about to look away when something *changed* on the screen. Mark snapped to attention, nearly losing the remote as a large volume of frap-water hit the polished floor.
"Oh No....."

You have someone who is treating the billion-dollar plus project of Bitcoin like his personal open source project. Making assumptions and disregarding end users actual use-cases. 
This isn't rehab, where you have angsty teens angrily assembling clock radios, this is a living ecosystem where hasty choices and "mistakes" matter.
So no, I don't think he gets much of a chance, because someone premeditating shenannigans extends to OTHER choices, and frankly I see a weak link that is furiously backpedaling because of popular outcry -- **NOT** because his choices were ethically suspect to begin with. *(And they were, but he won't admit it.)*

We seem to get similar posts like yours every time Bitcoin starts making new lows. 
I'd love to believe everything I read on the internet, but seeing the familiar sob story of how someone took 1/3rd of their disposable income and subsequently blew out trading like a maniac, you'll have to forgive me if I don't really have much faith in your "situation".
No one who had done their homework on trading, much less just on Bitcoin, would've done what you did. You trade with a plan, not hopes and dreams. You kept on buying with zero thought towards stops or limits.
That isn't trading, that's just throwing your money out the window and paying exchange fees for the privilege.

The truth of the matter is we are nowhere near the valuations needed where such a small fraction is considered the "mean" of transacted value.

Oh look, someone lost their temper. How amusing.
**1.** Cisco's international business has taken a big hit since the revelation of NSA's involvement in compromising their gear. That's only the start. Perhaps you're too busy huffing the fumes from your latest rack install to pay attention. *(Or are you one of those primadonnas that don't touch infrastructure? Who can say...)*
**2.** Nobody said IPv6 was a Cisco protocol, you made the assumption that your mono-culture network would exist, which is hilarious considering the competition from Juniper and others.
**3.** Typical network hardware/firmware contains the rules for controlling the flow of packets across the network, usually in proprietary *(Cisco's usual integration from disparate buyouts of different technologies and cramming them into their gear like some kind of grotesque burrito)* formats in an opaque manner.
Since SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane in this instance, YES, you could actually dynamically change the routing of traffic in your little mono-culture network if you were so inclined.  
**5.** What you know about me wouldn't fill a single line of your SSH session, so don't bother, packet-jockey.

The point was, the higher the valuation, more "bad" money can move into the ecosystem which in the long run, will dampen volatility as it remains there.
As for short term volatility, yes, it will remain high until the adoption percentages start to climb, that is just the phase that we are going through right now. It won't always be wild swings and rallies in the future, though.
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:26:53
Even if the cost was exactly the same, its the principle that matters. I'd rather support the network by using Bitcoin and a transaction fee, than to enable the same old legacy system that has zero incentive to change.

The QE "tool" you espouse as "working" hasn't produced much in the way of employment, has it? But naturally you'll tell me in the next breath that you believe the BLS implicitly, no doubt. Your government-trusting leanings are quite obvious.
Saying that "Japan is still here" is beside the point that they've saddled their future generations (and several MORE beyond who is alive right NOW) with burdensome debt. They can barely make the payments to roll over their debt-instruments.
Now, the BOJ will be the sole owner-and-backstop of the largest pile of debt-excrement in the history of finance. You call that progress? You call that some kind of masterful control over economic inputs?
I call it debt-slavery disguised as econometric pseudo-babble.
As for the FED, the weakness will be discovered, and the final flaw expressed when QE can no longer be entertained. (And has been stopped at least for now), and when that occurs, these "tools" that you are so breathlessly depending on to manage a hideous mountain of debt will be utterly impotent and useless.
I'm sure the response will be more of your Keynes-loving money voodoo, so unless you have something better than "Japan hasn't imploded" *(yet)*, I think you'd do well to step off the kooky-economic-soapbox you've been standing on.

Also, I'm put off by the whole "pump the money" aspect of this crap. It reads like a high-pressure sales brochure for Florida timeshare condos.
Examples from their site:


The "incentive bonus table" is a nice laugh:


No shit? Hey, sounds like we have an experienced pump-and-dumper here managing the campaign. "Better get in! Time is running out!" LOL.
They also conveniently leave out that Disastercoin isn't needed for this process, at all. Far from "cutting out the middleman", you could just send Bitcoin instead.
The final laugh is the "exodous address" concept. Yep, it will be an exodous alright, straight to their wallets - including that 15% kickback to keep their developers "motivated".

2. **Asking Questions** - this is the morning-after follow up thread, where sober questions are asked of *&lt; service &gt;*, which really should've been done first, avoiding the drama thread.
3. **Petition** - This is where the remaining drama energy goes, and after being buried by a story of some random *&lt; viral &gt;* thing associated with Bitcoin, drags on the seafloor like a rusty anchor until nobody cares about it anymore.

Where to even begin.
1.) Fiat is backed by government, who uses force to get what it wants. If you think it was just laws, I'm sorry, that isn't the world you live in.
2.) Currency collapses are caused by massive inflation by governments/economists/idiots that repeat the same mistakes, over and over again. Not because "it solved a problem" *(Where did you get that one from? Crazy.)* Every fiat system fails, eventually for this very reason. Also, hyper-inflation is easy to fix? Oh really? How... insane.
3.) Non-counterfeiting does matter, but somehow you confuse this with a run-on sentence about believing in something or other. I'm not even sure what the hell you're trying to say here.
4.) You think fiat wins the "stability" argument - well, comparing the two is a bit unfair, Bitcoin is FIVE years old, compared to the currencies around today. Central Banks intervene in their currencies constantly, so I don't know where you get that "eliminate a lot of speculation" nonsense.
5.) Volume has diminishing returns? And yet you used that earlier to say fiat has "won" the stability comparison? What color is the sky in your world? Volume is also not "like diversifying between stocks of the same market". This would be like saying "All green ice cream is pistachio". It makes no sense.
6.) And finally, this chestnut "The amount of users doesn't really matter, the prices would fluctuate wildly" - so... more volume means deeper markets but it wouldn't matter? Are you just posting drunk? I can't even begin to get what this is supposed to mean.

Also, seeing how storage space is declining in cost, but bandwidth costs are still at a premium per byte - aren't you essentially losing money by allocating your storage via your connection using this system?
The lost "opportunity cost" of allocating a significant part of your bandwidth to this "Safe" scheme seems a bit silly, especially when open-source alternatives to large arrays and peer-to-peer sharing already exist without the needless tokenization step.

So it comes down to whether you believe their press release. This is from CEX.IO, which from all reports I could find, owns Ghash.io:
In which they state:




* We will temporarily stop accepting new independent mining facilities to the Ghash.IO pool.
* We will implement a feature, allowing CEX.IO users to mine bitcoins from other pools. So when they purchase GH/s they can put it towards any pool they choose.
* We will not be implementing a pool fee, as we believe the pool has to remain free.


So, either you believe that, or you don't. I think it is in their economic interests to not be massive dickheads, and the wording of their press release seems to reflect that.

* It couldn't hurt to have some on-screen bullet points while she's talking to the side, if you can do titles you should be able to do some simple fade-in overlays. [Presentation Format]
That's how you do it. You don't have to call someone a fucking idiot, or say their entire effort was a piece of shit. You just break it down and try to keep a calm and centered viewpoint as you describe what you might change.

The market is most assuredly not random.
The Hurst Exponent for a random series is 0.50 - and a price series with "memory" exceeds this value. If you ran a daily chart of closes through the calculation you'd discover the same.
It also doesn't conform to a standard gaussian distribution *(The bell curve)* either, as the mean is usually a bit too narrow and high than the standard, with "lumpy" tails that indicate price moves that are way beyond the probabilities for such events should be. *(Happen more often that expected.)*

I spend Bitcoin when I need something. By doing that, I refute the entire troll-esque reasoning of "nobody spends Bitcoin, because blah blah blah future blah blah".
Same thing here. Also, no one has actually made an economy that is inherently deflationary, so economists have zero reference how it would work, or what its perceived flaws are. They can speculate, but their only basis is the few times in the history of a nation (Usually when at war) when deflation crops up.
Deflation in an inflationary system isn't death, either. But no, any talk of deflation from these economist "experts" leads you to believe that the world will spiral into the sun because prices decline, blah blah blah.

The direct link to the speech from the Fed is here:


So, here's the unwritten subtext of what is going on - somehow, magically, a bank won't use taxpayer money **directly**, but will issue magical unicorn bonds that people are supposed to buy.
The problem here of course is, they assume there will be a market for a distressed bank issuing bonds.
What happens when their sale is under-subscribed? The bid-to-cover ratio failing to meet minimums?
My guess is they panic and have to make up the shortfall somehow, and you can bet it won't be coming out of any politician's salary.
The buyer of last resort *always* ends up being the taxpayer, direct or not.

Not every "innovation" is the best path. Not every project that raises money means it is the "one true way" or even part of the larger movement to get crypto to evolve.

Somehow I doubt someone who was planning to harm Mark would make a pit-stop to tell reddit about it before doing the deed.
As for Mark being partially or fully innocent, I have my doubts. I don't have proof that he's a complete sociopath, but given what we know so far, I'd go as far to say he's completely incompetent, if not an enabler of the events that occurred.
People loved the whole "thumb your nose at authority" schtick that DPR had, which is a big part of his somewhat Robin-Hood-esque *(in a drug kingpin way)* mystique. No kidding, people love drama. That's why the Kardashians are popular. *(even if they do look like hobbits)*
The murder-for-hire on the Silk Road trial was dropped, but we have no way of knowing either way whether it was a setup, or just planned well enough that there was very little evidence. Due process is like that, whatever.
Heroes? DPR was a dude getting rich selling contraband. Whoop-de-doo. I think most people just liked his tilting-at-the-"man" attitude and the fact that he was getting rich as a Saudi prince.
As for what government we get, that comes from rich people pushing money into the system and lobbyists, so I don't know what the hell that has to do with anything.

It just shows what a conniving sociopath Mark is. He knew that Gox was declining in relevance, so he shuttled money into other subsidiaries so they wouldn't be enmeshed in the pending Bankruptcy, which he was planning all along.
Also, I read in an article that the "idea" of restitution from his profitable enterprises was an idea from one of the creditors, which just shows he doesn't give a toss about making people whole - he had to be REMINDED about his responsibility.

I get the first point - that you are saying comparing to equivalent systems of maturity - however, there isn't anything like Bitcoin to compare itself to, the alt coins aren't even close. So what then?
As for volatility as a measure of risk, Long Term Capital Management tried that trick, and they used sophisticated models that were supplemented by Scholes work, which just happened to be estimation of risk as applied to options and other markets.
They blew the hell up, because any estimation of risk just using their assumptions were completely flawed. *(Volatility was one of their inputs, by the way.)* I'd love to dig into precisely why, but there are many articles written about it already. That is also why the assumption of Bonds being "riskless" isn't correct either, but that's another subject entirely.

This is cool, because now Bitcoin has officially reached out into space. 
Part of this signal has leaked out into the surrounding solar system, part of the expanding RF "shell" that is the Earth's communications.
Granted, this wasn't *aimed* anywhere upward, nor was the power ridiculously high, but the signal is propagating outward, anyway.
Reference: UHF frequency "Space Wave" propagation - 
*(The transmitter in the Kryptoradio network is UHF)*

Did you read the article?


The first criterion is "medium of exchange". That isn't surprising he bent backward on that one, he can't claim it isn't exchanged for goods while Overstock.com and Gyft do booming business.
As for his other "points", they are the usual herp-derp-blerping that we see in every article pointed at discrediting Bitcoin:


Oh noes! Volatility! No shit, grandpa - this will start to decline as the transfer of crap green paper goes into good Bitcoin money, increasing order book depths. We've already seen it happen during the last decline, which was dampened by the very same forces -- if it was the SAME volatility as the last decline from 266 , it would've gone to 202 on Bitstamp, not stop dead at 382.


Oh sweet tap-dancing satoshi, the man actually thinks that Banks are the end-all of financial security. This speaks more to him pulling a paycheck being dependent on the current system than it does to Bitcoin. Also, services already exist to store your Bitcoins with a third party if you're so inclined. Good research skills, you old fossil.


HERP DERP DEFLATION DERP. Christ, every time I hear this coming out of an economists blow-hole, I just want to cram a big toxic CDO down their throat, and ask how in the hell does inflationary policy equal great economic news, when the system has complete heart attacks that must be remedied by TARP, QE and a whole menagerie of alphabet-soup bailout programs.

As for "concrete suggestions", might I suggest not listening to economists when considering the Max Blocksize issue?

Sounds like someone hasn't thought this through. Or they have, and have chosen to arbitrarily decide that zero-confirms is the *only* way to get point-of-sale to work. That is false.
If you structured a business properly, you could have multisig escrow release of coins that were enacted on a sliding scale based on purchase value. The higher the purchase amount, the more risk the payment provider must take - which would dictate either shouldering the confirmation time burden or not.
Just saying "Well, zero confirms is the only way" and ignoring that a small transaction could be released with minimal risk and not making the customer wait, is a bit ridiculous.
Its like someone decided to invent a wheel, but said "If you cut it in half, it no longer operates properly."
No shit, we knew that already, but you can work around the issue. That is why this zero-confirm bullshit is exactly that, a bunch of FUD-erating by yet another redditor with a stick up their ass.

**So, looks like mr-money-printing-lover deleted his post, which I helpfully captured:**


So you'll pre-emptively dismiss me for (potentially) citing government numbers while putting forward no evidence yourself. Extremely convincing.
Regardless the fact of the matter is you are moving the goal posts. This discussion is about whether or not your scenario of uncontrollably rising borrowing costs and an uncontrollably strengthening dollar is even possible. Which it is not. I've already expressed that there are certainly scenarios that the Fed would find very difficult to handle however the one you've described isn't one of them.


You've completely missed the point which was that if you leave inflation aside (which we are because of the scenario you posed) the central bank has an almost unlimited ability to reduce borrowing rates. The controlling factor for the size of a balance sheet would be inflation. The basic mechanics here demonstrate that your scenario is not possible.


And I'm sure your response will continue to avoid the fact your expectations for how the dollar could collapse simply don't jive with reality. The dollar absolutely could collapse, and the Fed could fail, but it won't happen as you've described because that doesn't make any sense at all.
* And my reply before he decided to wimp out:
Here we go again.
Lets define some ranges, shall we? The stroke you paint is so broad, I'm surprised the moon isn't covered.


No, it doesn't. There are limits to any system, and I'm certain they're not willing to go to 'unlimited' as you suggest.
You honestly think that a central bank would flood their debt markets until the ratio of debt-to-GDP soared above 110%? How about 150%? How about 200%? Starts to put a 'limit' on things, does it not? To blithely quote that they'd unleash a tsunami of debt willy-nilly is absurd.
As far as Japan, I **haven't missed the point**, because every citizen there is suffering under Abe's "balls-to-the-wall" approach of buying nearly the entire issuance of their debt instruments. Are you arguing that they are living BETTER lives as a result? Seriously?
As for dollar collapse scenarios - I'd love to hear what you think would constitute one, since what I've posited seems so "impossible" to you. Just throw one out there, I'm truly curious what a money-printing-advocate thinks is "within reason".

Except, when picking your debt, you made a mistake. You know, humans do that. Like in 2008, when the banks collectively decided to make tranches of Collateralized Debt Obligations, thinking that the multitudes of people who were assured to be AAA rated wouldn't be a problem.
But it was a problem.
Same thing, you make your assumptions and take on the debt you think you can handle, then the bottom drops out, there's a problem - and it cascades up the chain to the top bagholder.

Easy there, this is still a stupid idea, even if Brock wasn't involved.
Decentralized exchanges fail to cover the "last mile" and integrate into the legacy financial system.
"RealCoin" is a tokenized effort to become a 'bridge', where actual exchanges already exist. Its trying to duplicate a function of BTC/USD conversion, all the while saying that its value is dependent upon the US Dollar.
Backing something with the US Dollar, instead of merely converting to it, is probably one of the more fail-worthy ideas ever conceived. There's a material difference here, and that is why everyone thinks "RealCoin" is "FailCoin" in disguise.

Google warning about three-letter-agencies is most likely a move to give them "plausible deniability" when the shit hits the fan that they've been harvesting data and furnishing it to local agencies.
Every tech company has been approached about their users, and Google is no exception. They've been off the plot with their "do no evil" mantra for a while now, so I'm not holding my breath that the data-panopticon is going to suddenly be challenged because Google is sounding the warning klaaxon.

So lets spin another "what-if", shall we?
Lets say you're a ego-centric frenchman that thinks he's smarter than anyone else.
You build an exchange, and start to see the money roll in. This gets you excited, and you try to make it as large and crazy as possible.
Later, when the excitement wears off, you notice that other exchanges are coming under scrutiny, most alarmingly, other exchanges are showing proofs of solvency and holding accounts.
This is a problem, because you've been skimming from the exchange the whole time. Trading fees weren't enough, and as your operation grew, you figured that a little extra BTC in the kitty wouldn't hurt at all. 
I mean, hell, you have a Bitcoin cafe to build and other projects that are far more interesting than your exchange. In fact, screw the exchange - its "old hat" by now. 
So after waddling back-and-forth from the office to the coffee shop, the thought occurs to you - "Why don't I deep-six the entire fucking thing?"
No more meetings/employees/whiny customers... you start to smile as the thought takes hold, energizing your stride as you walk into the office.
The employees will be told nothing, as you access the database and start carving up coins into some cold storage wallets you had made just for that purpose. A few edits of the database later, it all seems like things are okay.
You squeeze the lemon a bit, prolonging the pending shut-down so people get used to transfers taking forever, and finally, when you are totally sick of the charade, you flip the switch and tell everyone they're fired.
With all that sorted, you waddle over to your expensive penthouse apartment, and smugly plan how you'll dress for the pending bankruptcy press announcement.
Mark is a psychopath, and he doesn't give two fucks about what he has done.

A few parties later, you're behind on fulfilling obligations and the poor suckers that have actually *found* your phone number are lighting that fucker up like a gas flare on an oil rig.
It all seems too overwhelming now. You could hire more people, but then *you* have to do all the work! Man, all these boxes... maybe if I just moved them over out of sight, things would seem better. Oh screw it, lets take a nap.

Its an unusual experiment, and something we've never seen before. I don't see how you can compare it with anything known, at all. The best we can do is compare valuation to other known currencies.
Everyone freaks out on the percentage increases in Bitcoin, but ignores penny stocks that went to list on the big exchanges at 25 - 30,000% returns.
Everyone loves to harp on volatility, but doesn't have any understanding of market depths, and how they've improved.

You'd have to sell into your own bid, which is a bit like asking if you can make a perpetual motion machine with an incline and magnets.
It doesn't work that way. If you sell into yourself, you're not netting profit, you are losing the percentage on the spread of the bid/ask. There is no magical way to yank price higher then profit from your own push without bids from other people following you.
Even then, it may not be enough, so then you'd have a tattered order book where most of the asks are gone, and the next sell will be matched to the highest bid of the time, which could be substantially lower than the last traded price.
There is no "free lunch".

Ghash.io aren't fuzzy little bunnies, nibbling at the tender green leaves of found blocks, you know. They are complicit, by the very virtue of having zero transaction fees, and apparently, zero controls on "gating" any new accounts.
So that very much makes it their issue, whether they want to admit it or not. The fact you can't wrap your head around it doesn't change the logic here. Ghash *could've* mitigated this, but they **didn't bother to do so.**

Good thing you have a technically-oriented CV, as those skills are still in demand wherever you go. Dig in and go for it, worst case is you have to get another tech job if your first attempt doesn't work. That's okay, it usually takes more than one try, don't get discouraged.

People may not be stupid, but your over-the-top hyperbolic reasoning is.
Value is present, shown by the obvious success of payment processors and other intermediaries. Its called a phase, where bad money is converted into good and vice-versa, according to a customer's whims.
The whole argument was based on Bitcoin not having value, which has been proven to be false.

Apple chose to get their devices assembled in the cheapest way, using the cheapest labor, at large factory "camps". They didn't bother making it locally, because - Oh Emm Gee - it would cost more.

Correct, price matters as an economic shunt.
You can't drain an ocean of money without the canal connecting the big money ocean with the Bitcoin reservior being as "wide" as possible. Higher prices allow more moved per transaction, accelerating the conversion.
The changetip trolling/backlash was interesting - you actually had these people complaining that free money was being distributed. If that isn't the most flimsy and desperate counter-attack, I don't know what is. What a bunch of morons.
The future is going to contain Bitcoin, and this is what the trolls hate the most. They missed their chance to crush it into the ground, early on, so now they have to take potshots and hope some of their flung excrement sticks.
It won't, and I will personally enjoy seeing another all-time high being made later in 2015 while their shrill troll-screams fade in the background.

Some more analysis of your talking *"points"*:
**1.)** Erik promotes erik's various ventures, before the diceploitation idea, it was a bitcoin-twitter concept he pitched on Bruce Wagner's show. If there were no profit to be had, Erik would be promoting whatever business scheme he had in mind, outside the Bitcoin arena. Bitcoin is convenient, and a new innovation, so he latched on early.
**2.)** When you promote yourself and attempt to turn your name into a "brand", then you're a public figure. You decry my relative pseudo-anonymous status, but ignore that *he* is the one that sought the limelight. How clever of you.
**3.)** He succeeded in doubling the blockchain size, causing a hard-fork as a result, and generally getting his way while exploiting a shared resource. These are apparently worthy goals and should be applauded, according to you. The power of rationalization is an amazing thing to behold.
But of course, I fully expect you to throw it all over your shoulder, because the truth - much like your lack of critical thinking skills - is far too burdensome for you to bear.

How about DTMF tones transmitted over radio? Granted you have the same problems that plague any other radio transmission as far as quality of signal, but it wouldn't need to rely on a 'hard line'.

This isn't creating a two-tiered Bitcoin system. Its creating a two-tiered surveillance system for Bitcoin. I think that is a fundamental difference.
Some addresses will be highly scrutinized, others will not. The Bitcoins themselves will remain fungible, it will just be up to the people involved if they want their transactions to be visible to the regulators or not.
It will open up the whole 'tumbling' aspect via alt-coins though, that's for sure. Even more than is done now.

I'm not concealing conversations with governments and their agencies about Bitcoin.
I'm not brokering deals with political compromises, playing into the existing system with lobbyist money.
I'm not pretending that the existing banking system gives two whits about Bitcoin, because the obvious conclusion is that Bitcoin makes a lot of their middle-man strategies obsolete.

Banks aren't more evil than any other enterprise? No? I wonder how many enterprises launder drug money and only get off with fines instead of convictions. Please point one out, I'd love to see if your point is at all valid. *(Probably not.)*
Bitcoin has scams, just like the dollar/financial system has scams - because both encapsulate something that has inherent worth. Tell us something we *don't* already know.
Ah yes, the clarion call about government being the most powerful force, etc.. Seems you missed the part in civics where the government is supposed to be representative of the citizenry. DPR broke the law, and he was persecuted - but banks weren't - thanks for making my point for me.

I would've given him *partial* credit if they had busted him at an airport, as that would've indicated he was trying to plan ahead, but no, he's just sitting there farting away the last of his California burrito in the library like there's no way they would be on to him.
Completely and utterly idiotic.

This is why the Bitcoin Foundation is flawed. Like any centralized enterprise, it is subject to the same forces that end up corrupting and compromising their lofty goals.
Engaging the government is a huge waste of time.
Pretending that a central organization can dictate anything to a global audience is a waste of time.
The only useful thing is the compensation going to core developers, but this link as well is subject to the same forces that cause corruption and compromise - and must be achieved another way.
But naturally, none of these warnings will be heeded until the governments they are engaging take their pound of flesh, politically or otherwise, exposing the foundation for the useless appendage that it is.

Its fine, but it seems a bit light on the real-world cases such as Overstock, etc.. I'd like to see more stats included in such an article.
Also, this is just the first phases of Bitcoin adoption, the real end-game is not utilizing payment processors at all. We have to climb up the mountain before reaching the peak, so Bitpay and the rest have a place before BTC denominated supply chains form.
Overstock has done a lot in this area, and I'm sure other vendors will increase this trend.

Ah yes, I recall all of this very well.
Remember when I called out Erik Voorhees for shitting all over the blockchain? This is the result. All of the "it would've happened eventually" bullshit aside, when people exploit a common resource, there are negative effects.
Now, if the developers pruned at an arbitrary blockheight, maybe it would help. But now we have freeloaders like Disastercoin and others that could give two shits - as long as they get their "investment" paying off.
Tragedy of the Commons is a real and serious problem, but very few people here understood it - they preferred to pay lipservice to the people they considered as "innovative", when all they were doing were exploiting everyone to make their fortune.
In a way, all these ignorant fuckbags deserve it.

He's an opportunist.
He'll construct a business model at the expense of others, because profit is all he cares about. He has a past history of consorting with others that have defrauded Bitcoin users, if it fits his business needs. This speaks to deeper issues when it comes to ethics.
Even if SD didn't exist, his main thrust is "pivoting to the cash" as a "prime directive", stripped of any consideration of consequence.
I find it ironic that he is idolized, when he's stepped on the backs of Bitcoin supporters to get there. Perhaps he is leveraging the worship of wealth as his "reality-distortion field", as once you are wealthy, people are less given to criticism -- *"Surely he knows what he's doing"* they'd say, pointing at the pile of coins, but oblivious to the methods he used.
And that is the real tragedy, lifting someone up to a position where they are considered a "safe" source of opinion and conjecture, when all he is really doing is sussing out the crowd and planning his next enterprise to fleece them.
The only reason I mention the grocery store tale is it speaks directly to his thought process when dealing with people. His convenience - carrying around large denominations, outweighs a simple grocery store clerk's time, the people waiting behind him, and generally his outlook on what HIS time is worth.
You don't have to believe anything based on this, but I've been around the bitcoin scene for a long time, and I've seen how this person moves from target to target, always devising some scheme to separate people from their money.

Because every conventional financial vehicle is really a disguised fleecing, especially after your yield is decimated by inflation that the government continually mis-reports, to hide the problem.
And that doesn't even address how you get double-dipped on taxes. Only chumps invest in equities right now, especially as QE is going to be made history (read: pushed somewhere else in the debt chain), so there actually might be some retracements happening.

Yes, though that piece implies its a given administration's fault -- I'd say in the recent history of the SEC, no major figure ever got more than a fine. Usually that fine represented a fraction of their daily cashflow, rendering it insignificant. *(And levied against a bank, not an individual.)*
This is the future, and the implications for Bitcoin aren't great in the USA. The Bitcoin Foundation can pat itself on the back all it wants, it isn't going to prevent the general co-opting of Bitcoin Business and the intrusive nature of regulation as it struggles to protect the legacy banking industry against Bitcoin.

Bets like this I totally support. They're a fun exercise in trying to predict an outcome by a defined date. Its very similar to option trading, where the strike and month you choose determines your success, and hitting it right is very rewarding.
The main difference between this and the usual Buttcoiner/cynic crap that gets posted here, is that the cynic never has to offer up a definitive timeline, just a nebulously implied "failure" of the system. This makes it an open-ended conjecture that honestly *anyone* can make.
You may not get the payout, but at least you had the balls to put it "on the line" and had the proper outcome for your position.
Even with the bet being a lower price target, you won, and I respect that.

As for Android, sure, you don't have the same kind of process - so maybe an app hash would work as "proof" it is the original, but it would tough to trust without full source and making comparisons to your compiled .apk output and what you grabbed from the Play store, etc...

Is that something that happens when you become rich? I guess so... loss of connection to normal working people. *(If he ever had that, of course.)*

If you assume a static ecosystem where BTC-&gt;Fiat transfer will reign forever, then you have a point.
But that isn't what is going to happen, as more adoption increases the usage of such transfer gateways, including exchanges, will fade in dominance.

I'll spell it out for you.
Facebook, where you volunteer your information and more importantly, your friends and family - each providing their own extended networks reaching to the horizon to be monetized by a benevolent dictator/CEO, is all based on the fact that information is commoditized.
Bitcoin is a hybrid commodity/currency, and runs on a global network. However, unlike Facebook, it doesn't make demands that you sell your friends and family down the river to use it.

Bearwhale didn't like this action one bit. 
There it was, on the screen mocking him, the bright neon green of the latest price bar burning his eyes, making them water.
**"Mooooore REDDDDD!!!"** he screamed, his bulk sloshing the briny water in his executive trading tank over his polished coral desk.
Small executive stress toys floated over the desk edge, plopping on the floor with muted tones.
Raising one large barnacle-encrusted flipper, Bearwhale slammed the brass-plated intercom, dented from repeated abuse.
**"BArrrrrrNABEEEEEEEE! GET IN HERE!"**
"Ye-ye-yes sir?"
Barnaby was a tired old seal, only kept around for the occasional office task and general amusement. Clothed in a single three-piece vest with a brass timepiece pinned to its lower pocket, he anxiously shuffled into Bearwhale's sight.
**"I'm not seeing enough REEEEEEDDDD!"**, Bearwhale spouted with emphasis, soaking Barnaby to the ends of his pale white whiskers.
"Sss-s-s-sir, we've run out of funds temporarily."
Time stopped.
Bearwhale turned one large black eye towards Barnaby, as if it was a cannon taking aim.
**"You will do well in this job BARNABEEEE, if you follow my INSTRUCTIONSSS!!!"**, another plume of water pushed the rest of his family's pictures off of his desk with a loud clatter.
Barnaby looked down, adjusting his watch-chain. 
"Yes sir, I..I.II'll see if I can find more to sell."
**"See that you DOO Mr. BARNABEEEE, or you'll be thrown to the sharks come suppertime."**
The threat hung in the air like the salty smell of the water, thick enough to cure bacon.
Barnaby bowed and pulled open the large Onyx doors, thinking desperately about how he needed to get another job, any job.
Bearwhale sloshed in his tank, glowering at the chart, making low rumbling noises.

Coming off like a business owner who would've single-handedly been "ripped off" by every bad situation in Bitcoin **and** would have had coins lost on Mt. Gox!
What are the odds? I'd say they're pretty fucking astronomical. But then again, we're taking you at face value, aren't we? We're also assuming you don't have any axe to grind against bitcoin in general, that you don't have a business that enjoys a relatively lax credit-card processing tier - or indeed, does enough business to qualify for one.
I mean hell, for all we know you repair old televisions and typewriters, and couldn't care less about Bitcoin because none of your clients would understand it.
Your story seems severely skewed. Pro-tip - if you want to sound more credible, just list one or two knocks for why you think Bitcoin won't help you. It seems you went overboard and decided to go for the gusto - and it seems a bit forced.

Price has its place.
Before Bitcoin hit one dollar, it was a "joke". Then later, there was no fucking way it would hit 10 bucks or higher. Price has its role, because as much as some here would like to discount it, price is the yardstick for how far we've come.
It also is the measure of utility of how fast you can convert shitty sovereign state money into good Bitcoin money. So price, ultimately, will be an ambassador to those that have no idea what Bitcoin is.

The mining argument always comes up when Bitcoin price is flat/lower. Yes, things do eventually "give" and so far that tendency has been expressed in price rallying.
As for miners in general, people would probably be shocked to learn that miners aren't completely rational, and will mine at a loss if they can pass on the cost of electricity, or in some cases, just idealistically want to support the network "just because".

The important thing here is **choice**.
People have the right to choose what transactions are "spam" to them, and not have that decision forced upon them. That is what makes Bitcoin an open network.
Any technology built upon the blockchain that is *not* opt-in, is ethically bankrupt and should be shunned. We must retain the right to choice, or else Bitcoin will become like the legacy system, where choices are made **for** you, and not **by** you.

Even conceding the gateway point as a SPOF, the overriding concern is the ability to create debt-chains that if defaulted upon, *(and the probability exists at all times they could)*, would produce a cascade scenario that would threaten the viability of the system. 
After all, there is no consideration of who owes what to whom - at least more than one step removed, which means you have zero assessment of the true risk that is really the cumulative chain of lending.
This will ultimately resolve into the cascade scenario, and that is why this system is just the old oligarchy impressed upon the digital age.

There's a generation inversion when it comes to precious metals. Gold, frankly, is seen as the old man's way to store wealth, while digital alternatives are more accessible to those that grew up with the internet.
I think that precious metals have their place, but they do fade in certain areas when compared to portability and the power of the network to transmit wealth across the globe. Not something you can try easily getting through an airport with your gold bars.
As for the price target, I saw a freeze-frame of that poll, and it seemed in the lower right-hand corner that the total participating was something like ~85 people. Not really a proper statistical sample, especially at a Bitcoin-only gathering.

Not really. If that were true, then Bitcoin spending would grind to a halt every time the price rose. It doesn't. Because people aren't idiots, they'll spend when they need to, regardless of the underlying price mechanisms in play.
That's why the whole inflationary/deflation debate in economic circles is so flawed, because it doesn't even consider what normal people would do, just the frame of a banker with a business to support by making loans.
Screw that noise.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:57:55
OP is incorrect.
It is in CEX's interest to actually hold the functioning of the network over their profit margins. If they trash the network, they have no profit. Seems like a pretty simple concept to grasp.
It is also in miners interest to hold the functioning of the network over their individual profit for the same reasons.
All of this "I can't help it, need the bux" kind of reasoning is self-centered and just shows how little people understand the overall system.

I still remember the discussion being about Bitcoin and not the underlying mechanics, but as sidechains became a topic we've morphed into discussing the whirring machinery "under the hood" so to speak.
As for your claim that Bitcoin is primarily a drug users conduit of choice, and therefore won't have any mainstream adoption - I have to wonder how you reconcile that view with cash, which is obviously used for illegal drug trade and somehow is also used by corporations - digitized into bank accounts, of course.
The point here is - if I see someone talking about Bitcoin that isn't bringing up legitimate concerns, such as mining centralization, block size impacts, and others, and instead is using every tool in the trolling-book to cast Bitcoin in a negative light - you better bet I'm going to call them out.

If the person isn't addressing a true known concern, like mining centralization, etc.. and instead is using any and all tools in the "trolling book" to make Bitcoin seem like an utter failure/scam, then I'm going to call those people out.
The ones that rail hardest against Bitcoin aren't the ones debating technical issues that need solving, they're the ones that are implying and outright stating that Bitcoin is a failure, even before the full race has been run.

Actually, there's no enforced "MUST UPDATE per [interval]" rule. The one that probably helped screw them over was the transition to iOS7, where Apple expects "universal binaries" that can anticipate the UI/OS changes, or if you wanted to, detect the difference from iOS6 and iOS7, and code appropriately.
From the developer portal:












So, not too much required and they don't even look at your app unless you submit an update - then they review it again. The Blockchain guys probably decided not to screw with updating it, because they knew Apple had it out for them with their own in-house payment system being worked on.
In any case, Apple screwed them over and I find it rather idiotic that someone is defending Apple over their monopolistic policies.

I get it, you love central banks and their debt-monetization schemes, *(plus the hilarious statement that they 'eliminate systemic risks', really - have you been paying attention since 2008?)*, I hope you don't live in the EU, because you're about to get a 10% "bail-in" on your bank account. But don't worry, they love you and care for you.
I understand risk. More volume does not reduce risk. Perhaps you're talking about volatility, but it is hard to determine with your articulation of the argument.
Also, using the common equity market as a definition of acceptable risk is absurd, seeing how all the regulators have been sleeping for quite a while, and haven't done anything to reign in the participants. Hence such things as the LIBOR rate-fixing scandal, the rehypothetication scam that MFGlobal pulled, etc...

Actually, the only reason Erik posts here is to boost his "brand". He's afraid of falling out of the spotlight, which will be useful for later business deals he's working on in Panama.
So, he pops up here every once in a while to make sure he can offer his glib observations about Bitcoin, and to boost any profit-making plans he has in the works.
Of course, nobody here sees that - he's some self-appointed bitcoin spokesman that is carrying the blockchain on his shoulders, scattering wisdom and advice to the poor paupers beneath his feet, etc, etc...

There's a **big difference** between a lifetime limited supply and one that isn't limited.
Bitcoin supply - **LIMITED** - this *inflation* you are saying exists isn't really what you think it is.
Fiat supply - **UNLIMITED** - this is *real* inflation, because there is no intention of a cap, or any kind of restraint. Look at the USA's "Debt Ceiling"... yeah, the one that has been **raised** every single time its been an issue.
Please understand the difference, there's enough ignorance out there about Bitcoin in general, it doesn't need this kind of confusion.

The fault lies at Mark's feet, and while he took his time trying to come up with a "solution", other exchanges bounced right back. As for taking longer - that was Mark's fault too - as his half-assed implementation didn't keep up with how the Bitcoin Protocol evolved.
How you can actually claim that Gox is free of fault and even further imply that they should be running instead of dead just points to the severe lack of critical thinking skills and complete co-opting of your judgement by the current financial system that encourages "oversight" (that fails regularly) and bailouts that penalize innocent people.

I read your post, and you deserved the criticism. 
By your own admission, you wanted some granular tracking for Bitcoin transactions to comply toward some higher standard than the usual KYC regs.
It can come through the Blockchain, forcing people to identify themselves, etc... the crux of it is, you wanted to build the panopticon that would tie all of this "metadata" together, and then package that for whoever might be a customer.
So, basically, take your mercedes and drive off a cliff, because you can snuggle up with the other companies that do the exact same thing with the intelligence agencies and all the other "actors" in the "snitch-sphere".
Oh, and spinning this as a way to "protect people from another Mt. Gox" is icing on the hypocrite cake. Your real business is brokering information, and getting your cut, heedless to how that information would be used.

The problem with "backed by something" is that we're seeing an entirely new hybrid of payment processing and currency, and we're trying to make it fit in a definition that is outmoded.
Using another industrial analogy, it would be similar to horse-and-wagon owners asking where do you store the oats for the horse in a modern car. It is an entirely new paradigm, so the question is absurd.

I'll give you one - actual yield on an investment.
Nationwide, the percentage yield on savings/checking is a paltry 0.8 - 0.9%, CDs fare no better, having sub 1% yields as well. This is due largely to the Zero Interest Rate Policies from the Federal Reserve.
As of this post, BTC is trading at 13.51 versus the dollar. It only has to move up to 13.65 to realize a gain of 1.036%, instantly beating the yield available in the conventional market.
Obviously you'd have your own target, but with bitcoin pushing 200%+ over this year and over 4,000% for the last two years, I'd say you'd be hard-pressed to find any other investment with the same yield profile.
Of course, all investments have risk, and though some people get all moist about FDIC insurance and all the other rigging behind the financial curtain, the plain fact is bitcoin is kicking the crap out of sovereign currencies, and will continue to do so.

Bitcoin is more than just how many green pieces of paper you can exchange them for. The central idea is monetary freedom. Your money, your choices.
It is no less a declaration of freedom than what our ancestors did when they came over to this continent. Luckily monetary revolutions don't require standing armies, just a lot of people who believe in the idea that you should be free to exchange with others without meddling agencies.
Bitcoin will always have parasites in the ecosystem attempting to grab ill-gotten gains, but that distinction is also shared with other currencies, so in a way, it is further validation of actual value.

This is the point most people miss. Bitcoin on its own is designed as a "poison pill" to any financial system that interacts with it.

The trend continues. 
I've been tracking the percentage change in prices between Mt Gox and Bitstamp, and we're a long way from the historical variance of **3 - 5%**.
We're typically in the **8 - 10%** band, and the only time the spread compresses is when Bitstamp rallies relative to Gox, or the infrequent times when Gox actually has a decline.
It is my expectation that Gox will continue to empty out its order book, and one day we'll wake up to some bizarre situation where they'll be trading at **180** or something, while everyone else is 40 - 50 bucks lower, because they're having their last *'bank run'* rally before they die.

I haven't "wedded" bitcoin to any particular ideology - it **is** monetary freedom, inherent to its design.
**1.** I can spend my bitcoin on anything I want, without third parties telling me I can't.
**2.** I can exchange bitcoin with whoever will accept it, in any amount I desire, at any time at all, to any place on earth.
That's called financial freedom, and that is worth fighting for. As for the assertion that bitcoin will succeed, so we should "take it easy" -- no, actually not.
The existing system has a vested interest in keeping any competitor away. This means everything from using dirty tricks to "legal" ones. 
*That* is why we fight, because just letting it bumble along isn't enough - bitcoin has to be bolstered by people who want to use it, so we can overcome the inertia of a corrupt global system of financial dickery.

The edge-exchanges provide egress into the bitcoin universe, and there is your real spending power. If you keep everything you can in bitcoin and only spend bitcoin on vendors who support it,  without transferring "out" into another yet-to-fail sovereign currency - you have the upper hand.
Wait until end-to-end supply chains start to form, all priced in bitcoin - and not giving two shits about Dollars/Krona/Yen/Yuan. That is when the TRUE fun begins.

falk-o is just noticing what we've known for some time now -- that Gox is a flaming shitpile, and their transfer problems are not subsiding.
What he calls "manipulation" are desperate buyers of Bitcoin, doing so in order to transfer out via the bitcoin network, instead of waiting for Karpeles incompetent staff to punch some keys to initiate a Wire/SEPA/Swift transfer.
So yes, falk-o has a point that gox blows, but he totally oversteps it and decides that means that Bitcoin itself is on some precipice of horrible doom.
It isn't. Gox may end up being the first exchange to kill themselves via consecutive blundering, but the Bitcoin network and its inherent utility will keep forging ahead.

Their per-unit profit **margin** is probably doing just fine, thanks to slave-like labor in China assembly factories. As far as market share, I've seen a large portion of that consumed by the Droid universe of smartphones.
As far as simple, see my comment further down this thread - but I do object to one characterization you have. Yes, to root a phone is a bit more complicated than an average user wants to do, but once it is done, you can let it lie for a while. It isn't like you have to re-do it constantly.

1.) As rewards decline the valuations for Bitcoin will either be huge, or bitcoin-only denominated supply chains will have been formed, which is an incentive to compete for the block awards or fees.
2.) Reward from block awards/fees would only not be "worth it" if Bitcoin adoption generally fails. As adoption increases, the utility of Bitcoin increases.

I disagree.
Bitcoin's future will be two-tiered, one version will be the "Regulation to Infinity" side, where they'll attempt to "legitimize" Bitcoin by forcing people to register to interact with the standard financial system and its controls.
The other tier will be the "No way in hell" crowd, which is much larger, and will be pursuing any and every way to keep themselves as anonymous as possible, which will also foster creation of services that are run strictly end-to-end with Bitcoin, cutting the standard system out of the loop entirely.
The "regulated" tier will stagnate, the "wild west" tier will succeed. This is the difference between a walled garden and freedom, and freedom will win every single time.

And yet, there are stocks out there that people buy at much higher prices. Bitcoin isn't an equity listing, and there are arguments that it may be a combination commodity/currency - but aside from that, there is utility in the system which goes beyond the paper-token-price.
When you have Bitcoins, you are participating in a system that allows you full financial freedom, and that is worth it on its own - forget the "future valuation" scenarios for a minute.

First adopter jealousy aside - there are some fundamental problems with Litecoin in their tweaking of the bitcoin parameters. 
For one, decreased time between confirms only increases the chances of a re-org or fork persisting in disparate parts of the network before the longest chain is dominant.
There's a reason the existing confirm time for bitcoin was selected, but I guess they'll have to find out the hard way when it fails to scale.

How pedantic. Okay - since you're incapable of finding the refutations you seek:
1.) "Backed by something" is a tired trope pulled out of the thin air - over and over. Proof-of-work embedded in every bitcoin isn't "nothing".
2.) Yes, the system is managed by algorithms instead of 85-Billion-A-Month moronic monetary policies
3.) The largest holder has ~105,611 BTC, the top 400 represent barely 30% of the total in circulation - this often comes up when people want to invoke the "BUT WHAT IF EVERYONE SELLS" tired old strawman
4.) The blockchain is transparent - so anyone can look at it. Doesn't link anyone to personal information, so beats me what his point is on that
5.) It is 'mined' by verification processors that protect the blockchain and prevent any possibility of counterfeiting - supply is constrained, but any newbie knows that - this guy is just an all-out troll
6.) It is limited by the algorithm - and yes, there aren't any humans to bribe or politicians to sway. Its called group consensus via the network - you nimrod
7.) Oh noes, there might be competition.... uh... so what? We have a large head start, in case you haven't noticed - regulation - sure, but in the end when there are end-to-end supply chains denominated in bitcoin it won't matter. At all.
8.) Yes, buy some if you can - it is certainly cheaper than mining.
Clear enough?

Because your average price, or cost basis, changes as you snap up more BTC at higher levels. In this case, even though it says you'd be at $1,865 - the order book wouldn't be able to handle the same volume of selling for you to make an easy profit.
In fact, it would probably net you a small loss, considering fees, etc...

I see what you're getting at, I think. You want to illustrate how small amounts of debt get leveraged in the current banking system as it "goes forward" in the form of other loans and such to other banks.
As for bitcoin, it doesn't rely on this kind of chicanery, just moving around between buyers and sellers. I'd pitch it as "honest money".

144 Blocks are mined every 24 hours. ASIC's change the allotment of these blocks, but at the same time the master "governor" of difficulty increases to keep the rate at 1 block every ten minutes.
So, temporary benefits of having more hashing power - that soon gets readjusted every two weeks to keep things in check.
Also, the maximum difficulty is around 10^244, so we have a lot of headroom for new technologies and such.

Actually the difficulty retargets after 2016 blocks, not a set time. Its only two weeks on average now because the current hashpower hasn't varied too wildly.
If someone hooked up an insane amount of hashpower, found a lot of blocks quickly, then that 2016 count would be hit much faster - with difficulty spiking to save the day, regulating found blocks to a sane level.

The problem with your "argument" is that you're comparing a financial system that has had over 100 years to develop, including subsequent investment and liquidity -- to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has achieved some rather remarkable things, but all you can come back with is -- "Well, it doesn't have the depth of the current capital markets."
No shit - that wasn't the point -- the point is that Bitcoin isn't cut from the same colluding cloth as the current system is. And you'd realize that if you weren't a soothsayer for the existing scamocracy.

It all comes down to how they approach the bitcoin system. Honestly they could hire their own team, make their own 'bankcoin' blockchain with their collective hashing power - and use the 'bankcoin' (BC) to transfer ungodly amounts of currency between themselves and other countries.
A replacement for the large wires that they use now - like the SWIFT/IBAN system.
Or they'll freak out and try to stop bitcoin - but the longer they wait, the harder that will be. My guess is it will play out much like the proliferation of torrent sharing did. By the time they woke up to it - it was far too late.

Actually, there is another phenomenon - when bitcoin value is high, people are more likely to spend them, because you're only using a fraction of what you would otherwise.
As price declines, the incentive to spend goes down with it. I don't have much hard evidence to present, just that I'm more inclined to spend when the conversion rate is massively in my favor.

Mt. Gox is losing trading volume because they're incompetent bunglers. They go "radio silent" when they should speak, and when they finally open up their mouths, they address things that have zero relevance towards the problems their customers are facing.
EUR/JPY is moving out of the exchange, but USD is still a pain in the ass, unless you pay a special non-advertised 5% fee for manual processing. This creates a bias that makes Mt. Gox a non-preferred place to store USD/BTC, which also means their order book is draining which leads to crap trade over long time periods.
It can even be argued that the spike buying was merely customers trying to get the hell out, using BTC as a vehicle instead of waiting for someone's pudgy fingers to execute an international wire request.

I don't think we're near the final blow-off high yet.
Lets compare with the April 2013 parabolic rally, shall we?
On the actual daily bar where price fell apart - April 10th - we have these prices:
High: 259.34
Low: 70.00
Net Change: -189.34
Percentage: -73%
For our decline from November the 9th, we have:
High: 363.65
Low: 265.01
Net Change: -98.64
Percentage: -27.1%
That's a decline that is much smaller. Personally, I think it implies we've had a correction - not a major top event.
Parabolic rallies tend to correct much harder than this, so we haven't even seen the "knee" of the curve just yet.

I agree that the decline would've happened anyway, with or without a concurrent DDoS.
My guesses, with the most likely at the top:
1. Competing Exchange
2. Disgruntled Mt. Gox User
3. Random pseudo-hacker trying to influence markets
4. Threatened financial entity - though this is pretty far out there...
5. &lt; Insert local government Agency &gt; - Also pretty doubtful right now
I suppose we'll get the facts when they finally figure it out. Unless the person(s) doing this are smart enough to cover their tracks.

Treat it like anything else. When trading, you don't risk capital you can't afford to lose. This means don't risk your rent, mortgage payment, or other substantial amount just to take a chance on Bitcoin.
If you can afford to do so, then realize that the volatility is pretty high. This isn't for amateurs, although you could say the April spike to 260's was largely caused by amateurs, piling in because it could "only go higher".
It won't, and it certainly didn't. These things *will* happen again, so you'd be better off understanding that and having a trading plan **before** things get crazy, and *stick to it*, even when everyone is saying we're going to $1,000 next.

You can stop hyperventilating into that paper bag now.
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:47:39
I've studied the Tulip Mania and the South Sea Bubble extensively, since they're documented with charts as well. In those examples - the peak was THE PEAK. Not the peak-before making another all-time high.
We've increasingly made all-time highs only to be exceeded by another run-up, and then a decline. That isn't long-term bubble behavior.
The last decline to 50.01, if it had been a "bubble" wouldn't have stopped there. It would've gone to single digits and finally a hair above zero before everyone fled the market.
So yes, I understand fully what bubbles are - even if you can only throw out one-line missives about your own ignorance.

Sure. Litecoin is a dial-twiddling bitcoin clone that upped the confirm rate at the network's expense, namely more blockchain re-orgs and orphaned blocks.
While this doesn't seem to be a big problem now, if the network grows any bigger these problems will result in parts of the network following a different chain fork than the other, with hilarious consequences as everyone churns to merge the "proper" block into the longest chain.
In short - a non-scaleable shitstorm is in LTC's future.
So much like a penny stock, it will achieve some kind of high before being swept into the dustbin of regrettable failures.

Worth repeating - re: Technical Analysis
Trendlines or regression-fit lines don't predict, they indicate in a simplified way what the current price progression is. If people are using them to predict - that is flawed. Trendlines are useful for staying in a trend when you have a position on, using it as a ruler to see where you're at.
As for chart patterns, some can be useful - especially realizing when you're in an exponential/parabolic move that can break down suddenly after a rise - but others are just hugely subjective and don't produce any actionable trading decisions.
To condemn it all is a mistake. Even statistical evidence suggests the distribution of price data isn't a random walk - it doesn't fit the normal gaussian distribution (bell curve) very well. The mean is usually higher and there are more excursions to the 'tails' that can't be explained.
If you're familiar with the Hurst exponent, a measure of past changes influencing future changes, you'd know that price series display a persistent reading above 0.5 (randomness), usually in the range of 0.7 to 0.8 - what this all means is that price does have an effect on what prices will be tomorrow. This is why certain techniques can work, and do so reliably.

This, my BTC friends is the first volley in the war against Bitcoin. 
With the Bitcoin Foundation blundering into this "battle against pornographers", we now will get to enjoy news reports that associate Bitcoin with Child Porn, and once that horrible barb has stuck in, it will be a difficult one to remove from public opinion.
How exactly is the BF (Bitcoin Foundation), supposed to do anything about this? Track users? Offer up user information from places that collect "Know Your Customer" data?
That's what I want to fucking know. What are they **compromising** to make everyone "safe"?
I can't believe they're that 'effing **STUPID** to get sucked into this. This isn't an opportunity to "work with regulators" and give Bitcoin a "clean bill of health" -- its an obvious power-play that will taint anything they do.

From their site:
"You place a bet by sending bitcoins to one of the addresses listed in the bet options table. SatoshiDice sees this, evaluates win or lose and generates a return transaction. If you lose, the return your bet times 0.005. That means a number way lower than your bet. If you win, your bet is multiplied by the prize multiplier and that amount is sent back."
They're using a small 'dust' amount as a signal that you've lost. This is called "signaling", and it uses the blockchain to do it, as the transaction is incorporated into the blockchain by a miner.
There are other ways to accomplish this, they know it, but don't care.

I ride trends until they've reached peak potential.
As far as Bitcoin is concerned, the reason you'd reap criticism is because it is patently obvious that the potential is extremely high.
For the first time, a system exists that gives freedom to the persons making the transactions, not to the greedy intermediaries of the past.
That is why all of this "cautionary" advice doesn't apply. Buffett only understands the conventional finance system, and as a result, has a bunch of very rich friends to collude with and trade information about investments.
This is an asymmetrical and skewed system, and Bitcoin is going to turn it completely upside-down. It will remake the face of finance.
Just because you think Bitcoin should behave like a stock hawked by an underwriter, or a Bond issued from a sovereign's treasury, doesn't make it so.
Bitcoin is not like anything in the world, and you know what? 
I'm really fucking glad it is.

The events that will happen to convert the finance people will be:
Bernanke finally blinks and reverts QE and associated programs. After all, it can't last forever. This will cause the equity markets to "correct" rather spectacularly.
The US Dollar falls from World Reserve Currency status, thanks to China negotiating many of their transactions in Yuan instead of the dollar, bypassing the US completely. Bitcoin may also hasten this as well.
Interest rates go out of control (they are barely in control, actually) and force The Federal Reserve's hand - resulting in many ugly scenarios that rock the financial and currency markets.
There also could be a "Black Swan" that nobody sees coming, that turns the whole debt mess into a complete disaster.
It doesn't look good for those parked in conventional equity instruments, casting about for scraps of yield.

Trendlines or regression-fit lines don't predict, they indicate in a simplified way what the current price progression is. If people are using them to predict - that is flawed. Trendlines are useful for staying in a trend when you have a position on, using it as a ruler to see where you're at.
As for chart patterns, some can be useful - especially realizing when you're in an exponential/parabolic move that can break down suddenly after a rise - but others are just hugely subjective and don't produce any actionable trading decisions.
To condemn it all is a mistake. Even statistical evidence suggests the distribution of price data isn't a random walk - it doesn't fit the normal gaussian distribution (bell curve) very well. The mean is usually higher and there are more excursions to the 'tails' that can't be explained.
If you're familiar with the Hurst exponent, a measure of past changes influencing future changes, you'd know that price series display a persistent reading above 0.5 (randomness), usually in the range of 0.7 to 0.8 - what this all means is that price does have an effect on what prices will be tomorrow. This is why certain techniques can work, and do so reliably.

I'm increasingly of the mind that inflation/debt is just another system of control, which exists outside other control structures.
Hard to argue with the fact you owe something to someone, which means you're under their control until you "get out from under."
That is why I think we'll see some rather nasty pushback form the existing financial systems, because Bitcoin is about upending that entire control structure.
You can argue about how long it will take, but just like the internet - the concept is out in the wild, and it is only a matter of time that the inherent benefits of a decentralized currency/payment system infiltrate society.
The divisibility of bitcoin, coupled with its global reach and "always on" nature - goes hand in hand with the mantra "money never sleeps". Bitcoin never sleeps, and it isn't at the mercy of petty bureaucrats and dictators.
Which is precisely why they'll hate it intensely.

Increased bitcoin value serves as a self-reinforcing feedback loop. Not in the sense of speculator mania (although that may occur). More in the sense that larger valuations of BTC allow even more funds to flow into the system.

**3.)** Gox *"can't talk"* about most of what people want answered, so you'll have to look at tertiary methods to glean information.

The spread premium between exchanges is the best indicator for their internal issues. Gox better get their act together, because if that premium goes beyond 25%, I think that will be the beginning of the end.

Have you not seen the difficulty adjustments that are happening? That any temporary rate beyond the targeted ideal is dealt with via these adjustments?
Anyone can start mining, and many do without any concern for whether they turn a profit. You're completely ignoring the core part of Bitcoin, which is the financial freedom it represents. This isn't a hoodie that is going to be made in China with a 5 cent zipper because anywhere else is too expensive. This isn't an MBA exercise in financial dickery.
This centralization you speak of is divided pretty well between large outfits, independent miners and other groups. We've even managed to balance out when one group looked like it might end up having a majority of hashing power.
I'd say that's a pretty good system, even if you think some convoluted corrections are needed.

I've never liked 'sheeple' or any of those nutjob phrases that circulate around conspiracy theorist forums or websites.
The sad truth is they're more like indentured servants, clad in materialistic chains, trying to "prove" how happy they are.
But they really aren't. The medications, the two weeks of vacation a year - its a paltry reward for being used up and having little freedom to do what the rich and well-connected enjoy.
The frustration some have with people accepting all of this is how easily these servants can be distracted. Put on some TV, have a few beers -- hey, it isn't so bad, I have my 401k and I "own" my house. (But pay property taxes every year - so its really just a displaced form of renting)
That the blinders can be so flimsy and idiotic is really why the whole 'sheeple' thing came about. But I prefer to think that they aren't mindless, just resigned.
That could change, and bitcoin is a big part of that.

Just a summary here in case people didn't want to watch through the whole thing.
He's supportive of bitcoin, touches on how precious metals protect from debasement that sovereign currencies are suffering from.
Mentions that he's not absolutely certain bitcoin will be successful, but pegs this at a pretty high 98% that it will work. His doubts are any unknown flaws, encryption weaknesses, or new technology that impedes progress.
He doesn't think that governments will be able to stop it, however.
He does a good job acknowledging the risks of the bitcoin experiment and concludes with an interesting point - that bitcoin haters never hedge their statements to account for the possibility that they could be wrong. 
This will result, he says, in bitcoin critics not ever apologizing for their statements.
Seemed like a well-informed person who has a supportive view of bitcoin overall.

**Retirement** *(opt in/out - plan your own or contribute govt administered one)*
**Defense** - Amount needed for defending **domestic** borders only
**Extra Projects/Line Items**  *(opt-in and only contributed to if you truly support the idea or goal)*
This also opens up things that you could only do with bitcoin - granular payments to specific accounts that get verified in the blockchain ledger.
It also changes things socially - if I don't have a car or kids, why the hell am I paying for roads and schools?

Reposted for those that value critical thinking:
There are some more rumours floating around. I think it reduces down to a few possibilities:
**1.)** The recent price surge is either a large player or a collection of smaller players trying to exit Gox.
**2.)** The recent price surge is a few large "whales" that have preferential status in Gox, so can transfer at ease. Not so if you're a "small fry".
**3.)** The premium spread means that transfer is indeed a convenient fiction, and arbitrage activity is nonexistent due to Gox being completely incompetent.
Pick your poison, unless volume really picks up at Gox I think they're in a death spiral where the spread increases to ludicrous levels.
My guess is anything over 25% means they're circling the drain. *(Comparing mtgox over bitstamp).*

I won't attack you - but this impulse to label bitcoins is misguided. Sure, people have lost coins to scammy things, but it is a slippery slope when you start to label a bitcoin "Good" or "Bad".
What if I'm a business and I don't like my rival - are their Bitcoins blacklisted?
What if I'm a political figure and I don't want to use any bitcoins from my opposition - are their Bitcoins blacklisted?
What if you want to contribute to a cause, but for some reason, they can't accept your bitcoins because some of them passed through Silk Road 2.0 - not because of you, just how things work - are YOUR bitcoins blacklisted?
They shouldn't be, in any case - and this whole idea of trying to segregate coins is dangerous and horribly flawed.

The "Deflationary Death" mantra comes from the same people who steered the US into a Housing crisis, couldn't be bothered to let bad banks fail, and generally do a piss-poor job managing large monetary networks.

Don't rely on just one exchange. Today/tonight's action just underlines all this. Also, don't keep balances on them either.

I'm not surprised that banks and financial firms are following bitcoin. It is the one thing that has a chance of challenging their monopolies. I also expect them to fight in any way they can.

This is a pretty rare event, which of course means something seriously went wrong. I'm curious as to whether this was an internal failure that propagated forward, or an external one that caused the same problems.

Thin order book depth - relative to larger markets like Forex and Equity Indices - implies volatility by its very nature. As more exchanges come online, and badly made ones lose market share, we'll find a balance that allows more order flow that will dampen price swings.
This is very similar to Forex where cross pairs that don't have much interest or volume tend to trade rather jaggedly and in large increments because each trade is hitting a bid/ask spread that is pretty wide.
As for volatility 'killing' the bitcoin economy - unless we see all the transaction verifiers (miners) turning off their rigs forever, producing a pronounced downtrend in Total Network Hashrate, I still think we'll grow and improve.
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:38:22
First, I'd like to see some definitive proof of that - and given the nature of the system, I doubt it can be furnished -- also, if anyone is to have a controlling interest, I'd rather it be the creator -- since they have the most 'skin' in the game, the first impulse isn't to destroy it, but preserve what they've made.

The big mistake is to take a USD valuation of bitcoin and say "That is its true value."
It isn't. The value inherent to bitcoin as a system and a currency is the freedom and decentralized nature of the network.
This is similar to how gold is valued on "paper", but that isn't the true value - the true value is it can't be replicated at will -- just like bitcoin. There are physical limits for gold, and algorithmic limits for bitcoin.
As for New Zealand not playing the central banker games, I'm sure they'll crack like every other country in the G20 who professed the desire not to debase, but then ran home and got their programs initiated regardless.
Nobody likes being the last to export inflation - and that is what precisely will happen to every sovereign currency on this planet.

I'm thinking the threat of Bitcoin is big enough that they'll try a bit harder than the usual "block this port range" kind of tricks.
Deep packet inspection tools working at wire speed exist now. And even if you are using encryption, network profiling and pattern analysis could be used to suss out whether you're "Bitcoining", especially if other nodes aren't careful about concealing their purpose.
I'm just wary, and I hope we don't see it, but I'd rather do something instead of wishing. Wishing makes a poor fallback plan.

Well, thank you Erik for showing once and for all you're just a profit-chaser - you don't care about bitcoin, well, only enough to get your money out of it.
As I understand it - and please, feel free to add your crocodile tears here - you're going to **DUMP** a shitload of BTC on the market in general, to *"shareholders"* that will no doubt seek to **"cash out"** in droves. In a short time period, no less.
*"I know some of you will be upset"*
Yes, I am upset - first for your wholesale abuse of the blockchain, and now, for not only continuing your abomination but now trampling all over the BTC market in your urge to scratch that profit itch.
Will someone please hire Erik so he stops this pattern of wholesale dickery? What the hell is the next business enterprise, monetizing desperate immigrants? I can only sit and wonder, since I don't have the obvious lack of social acuity you display in your business schemes.

The spread is what tells the truth.
$10+ dollars between Gox and Bitstamp tells me that nobody wants to liquidate into paper token money over there, because they're not sure if they'll get it.
However, if you use a balance of cash to buy BTC, I've heard that those transfers are going through. In any case, people would be arbitraging their asses off if they thought the 10 bucks would be easy to transfer out.
And they aren't.
Also, volume is approaching craptastic-2011 levels. So either we're watching Gox die a slow death, or something else new is happening, we're just not being told what it is.
Guess we'll find out the hard way, eh?

One more comment on growth scenarios.
Some people look at bitcoin and see the large percentage yields that have been occurring - they point to this and say its impossible, should be a "bubble" etc..
There are other financial instruments that have traded upwards of 25,000% and they're listed on the NASDAQ. They started out on the OTC or "Over-The-Counter" market, also known as "pink sheets".
They managed to survive and get listed, pulling in large amounts of business. 
Before anyone accuses me of "survivorship bias", I know that this example ignores all those that crashed and burned in the OTC market... however, I think the fundamental forces behind bitcoin (global reach, monetary freedom, transparency) are a trifecta that is hard to recreate in any conventional business enterprise.
So, when someone points at another 50% or more and shouts "bubble" - think about how those who had the foresight to stick with their investment felt when they finally hit the "big time".
Just something to think about...
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:46:16
Actually the people I know think the opposite - they know what the parabolic run-up looks like, and are preparing to exit when it is rising, to catch the bargains later.
This doesn't mean that Bitcoin is "dead" or "over", just that you have to watch your timing carefully on these severe run-ups. The volatility will decrease as price increases, so you should be encouraged that this is taking place.
Another point to note is subsequent declines don't go below the prior parabolic rally high. That is important.

Okay, so I see where he's coming from, but its rather bleak for a guy who put all of his personal savings into Bitcoin.
He still believes in the ultimate "end game" valuation, which is orders of magnitude higher than we are now.
His case is Bitcoin seems to be worth *(magic napkin numbers)* about **$4.00** USD. But, the market disagrees...
I suppose if he felt that strongly about it he could go to Bitfinex and short it, but he'll probably not - because he's blaming the markets, too.
He's using **Empty Gox** prices for one. We've all bitched on here about how they're screwing up, so I'm not surprised he thinks something funky is going on. Large buys to transfer out, that kind of thing.
And he's suddenly become aware of trading bots, ping-ponging each other for 0.001 or 0.01 or whatever is the current fashion this week. Yeah, welcome to trading bitcoin on **Empty Gox**, where bots reign supreme.

It will end in tears, of course. And I didn't even touch upon the whole centralized failure that the "escrow" fund is going to be. If the lead dev gets hit by a bus, there goes your "peg", because something tells me a person making these kinds of mistakes doesn't even have a disaster recovery plan.

I bet a lot of grocery shoppers would disagree with that figure. Also, considering how many food companies have redesigned their containers to contain slightly less product at the same cost, this inflation has been "hidden" slightly.

@_date: 2013-09-19 18:21:03
You need version 0.8.5 - but if you have to, you can run the client by invoking it from the command line with the extra argument "-checklevel=2", so it will skip the malformed transaction that made 0.8.4 clients freak out.
It will probably still rebuild if you already told it to - if not, then it should start up normally and you'll be fine.
(But upgrade if you can.)

Fibonacci is a fun number series, but the problem with charts like these is you ignore the non-selected *"reaction"* points.
Look to the left, before the major high at ~150, why is it that the fib level before the final push to that high didn't *"work"* but the one circled at the top did?
That's right, you're just selectively choosing where those lines magically do *"something"*.

Where to begin... this muppet thinks that ASICs are forcing "extra inflation", which he attributes to faster block discovery.
This bias is pretty small in the larger scheme of things, not to mention the final amount of bitcoin is fixed, unlike his favorite paper token currency.
He also entertains the idea that government could just force mining pools to bend to their whims. Riiiiiight.
Then he claims we're "overpaying for security" and "what do these miners do anyway", all the while claiming he has the "big solution" that of course only his company owns.
Start an alt-coin and stop whining, if your ideas are worth spit, then you'll displace bitcoin. If not, you'll prove your irrelevance.
@_date: 2013-01-02 14:16:59
That is why risk is part of every investment. The reason I think bitcoin is an *acceptable* risk is because it has a property that other currencies lack, DEFINED upper bound of issuance (21 million tops), decentralized, immune to interference by politics and dodgy monetary policy.
Also, viewing bitcoin by its exchange rate is misleading - for the very reasons I outlined above. No other currency can even approach the mathematical bedrock that bitcoin is forged from. NOT A SINGLE ONE.
Even if every "edge" exchange stop operating TODAY, that would not change the inherent properties of bitcoin at all.

This isn't your usual price speculation, this is fundamental analysis. An observed fact that the bids are accumulating is important. Even if a small percentage pull their bids, the overall sum is pretty impressive.

Politics is the distraction for the masses. While people in the USA rant on all available media channels about team red or team blue, the real changes are being pushed through by global corporations and back-door deals.
Bitcoin is the thin edge of a wedge that could result in real change, because once you have a system that allows financial freedom, then other things inevitably follow. Namely, the disintermediation of "old boy" power networks that stifle the very changes their populations crave.

How about this hypothetical situation?
Lets say I was chatting with some friends of mine, and I said, *"you know, this not_a_wolf strikes me as someone who would really like to die. I don't know why exactly, but I'm going to go buy a butcher knife to do the deed."*
Now hey, I'm just talking about it, right? And since buying a knife is totally something I *could* do, why not just *talk* about it? What's the harm? Maybe I brought it up a few weeks ago, so its an old idea - what's the big deal, man?
Why are you backing away from me? I don't get it...
Again, in this hypothetical example, just because you COULD do something, isn't a good basis for actually DOING IT. While that example is a bit extreme, it applies to our current situation.
Sure, we could do all these horrible things to Bitcoin WAY before, but it doesn't diminish the horror and reaction at all. There's nothing "cute" about it, nothing at all "relaxed" or "normal" about these proceedings.
That is precisely why people are concerned, and the ones deadpanning like there's not problem and "hey guys, I don't get it - its just some talk about some stuff and junk, whatever" seems rather shallow and empty.

Oh right, you mean the old greyhairs that still think the Equity markets are not rigged and things are traded fairly there.
First, Bitcoin has no earnings, so a Price to Earnings ratio makes no fucking sense. Second, it trades more like a commodity, so forget all that nonsense about Sharpe Ratios and having a diversified portfolio - those are all based on the gaussian *(Standard distribution)* understanding of how price fluctuates, which is systemically wrong.
*(Just ask LTCM how they feel about leverage and relying on the Gaussian distribution at the heart of their risk-pricing model. Oh wait, you can't -- they blew out.)*
And finally, if you really trade to TRADE - and not natter on like some retiring hedge fund manager getting his fees every quarter, you won't give a rats ass if it is priced with one, two or three zeros after it. 
The only rule when trading something is the fucker has to **MOVE** first. Boring markets bear less risk, but less risk turns into oatmeal-like returns. 
Screw that.

I get what you're saying about difficulty being the regulation mechanism - that totally makes sense. My argument is that the conventional financial system doesn't increase in efficiency beyond what we have today, and in some cases, remains lodged in the past because upgrades introduce security risks they're not willing to vet or take.
So overall, while we will achieve an equilibrium in price/mining expenditures, those collective costs will still be much lower than the worldwide financial system with its datacenters, fiber links, physical banks and so on.
That's all.

It's relevant in the sense Bitcoin is an algorithmically controlled system that isn't susceptible to the crap that spews from every orifice of a finance minister.

I'm not too optimistic about this move. Moving a majority of the order book to US Shores just means it will be easier for legislators to clamp down if they think bitcoin is a threat.
Shorting bitcoin using standard "borrow" doesn't bother me, but firms also allow "naked" shorting, which doesn't rely on any borrowing restrictions - so everyone can pile in and distort the order book.
If High Frequency Trading makes inroads to this market, it will become as bad as the main indexes - huge rips up and down, algorithms front-running the order book, etc...
Correction: Only the payment systems are moving to the USA, the order matching will still occur at MtGox in Japan, I misunderstood that part - however, I'm still not a fan.

There's a reason that bitcoin was designed to be decentralized and trustless. It was made under the assumption that any central control can become corrupted, any trust given can be betrayed. This has worked out really well for the system.
You should also apply the same logic to any decisions made using bitcoin. Unfortunately, storing your bitcoins on a centralized site and trusting the owner not to betray you has resulted in failure.

Actually, on the government issue - perhaps we're on the way to a decentralized scheme as well. Disintermediation isn't just for financial processes, you know.

Paranoia, in small doses, can be a healthy thing. You however have stepped over the line of "what if" to "they'll do this...", and in doing so expose yourself for being caught up in your own nightmare.
You firmly believe that "they" control Bitcoin, and by doing so, are ushering a new era of control, blah blah blah.
That seems at odds with the decentralized nature of the entire system, does it not? Can I dictate to you how to spend your coins? No - I can't. However, if you currently use the existing corrupt system - they can tell you **EXACTLY** what you can spend on, and if "they" don't like it, they can freeze your funds.

I find it odd that the “Why doesn’t hashing do something useful” gets so much traction.
It is useful, it secures the block-chain and enforces the rules that make bitcoin what it is. You don’t have people complaining that a word processor program isn’t using its spare cycles to render “useful” 3D objects, or that a car isn’t using its spare horsepower to fix potholes.
Useful work is happening, even if it is perceived as repeated calculations doing “nothing”.

Probably because at the core of it, bitcoin is about freedom. People tend to get a bit defensive of something that they see as freedom-enabling.
To suggest criticism of Bitcoin, you're essentially saying the existing system is *"just fine"*, and perhaps even tacking on a derisive *"what the hell do you nerds think you're doing"* as well.
Even if you didn't mean to do that, just combining a bit from each is enough to create a rather explosive mix, with the usual results.
So why are bitcoiners defensive? Because the existing systems around the world **suck**, and they are all about control, not freedom for the individual.

Namecoin has its own blockchain. It isn't trying to stuff extra things into the existing Bitcoin blockchain. Big difference.
Namecoin also has one of rarest attributes of an altcoin, actual utility. It matters that domain registrations and DNS-esque qualities be built into a decentralized infrastructure.

Satoshi Dice is an elaborate delay-of-service attack, which you pay for in the time it takes to sync the bitcoin client for the first time, or when you need to get up to date after not running it for a while.
It is also responsible for 48% (and rising) of the total blockchain size right now. So when you play, you're actually harming yourself and other future bitcoin users.

Your comment seems awfully shortsighted.
"... the same fate as metal backed money"
We're going to take bitcoin off of a standard? What? The protocol remains inviolable, we're not trying to trade in metals for bitcoins. We're also not contemplating minting a trillion bitcoin unit to solve debt problems.
And your other point - (Suggestions of manipulation due to upper bound on issuance)
Er... what? 2.1 Quadrillion units seems like something someone could "corner"? You realize that is more than every single blood cell circulating in your entire body, right?
By emphasizing bitcoin to be a transference vehicle for other sovereign currencies misses the point entirely - once bitcoin gains enough momentum, there won't have to BE ANY OTHER CURRENCIES. We'll all happily buy/trade/whatever with each other without having to risk transferring into politically mis-managed sovereign currencies.
I'm just amazed that the primary strengths of bitcoin are being argued against here. If anything, edge exchanges are going to become more irrelevant as time goes on.

A quick jaunt to wikipedia produces:


And that's the actual bogeyman that they're "warning" about with Bitcoin, since it has a fixed issuance amount. Other than "mild deflation" in Japan *(The product of an insane money printing experiment wreaking havoc in their economy)*, and a few minor incidents in the U.S. averaging with a few single digit declines *(and the one outlier of cotton going to crap)*, there really hasn't been any "death spiral" that gets constantly harped on.
The real thing I see here is fear - they're terrified that Bitcoin could take all of their coddled pseudo-science economic theories and throw them out into the garbage, where they deserve to be.

You know what conquers nations? It isn't standing armies, its debt. Japan is in the middle of a rather slow-burning debt-bomb, as well as the U.S.A. - just a matter of time, and the damage that will be wrought will exceed anything an army could do.
When Russia defaulted, it didn't take nukes or anything like that, just their debt got out of control and killed their currency. Many other countries are in the same boat, latino countries even more so.

I have to give the original poster credit. Yes, linear charts can be deceiving when it comes to Bitcoin, because that bastard can go hyperbolic on a moment's notice.
I think he has a point, in my analysis I've been looking at the scenario of the 2011 winter slide, and until we started to diverge, I honestly thought we were setting up for the late September to November blues.
I now think we've diverged enough that we're setting up for another hyperbolic rally. So if you're not using log charts now, I'd recommend it for the future.

There's considerable mining variance when finding a block. Just because a bad actor could find N+1 blocks and not broadcast them, doesn't mean that another pool won't find N+2 blocks and zoom ahead.

I think this is mostly the USA turning themselves into an has-been country. If they enact anything, it will remove incentive to use Bitcoin within their borders. 
Meanwhile, in other countries like China, bitcoin will thrive on their "hands off" policies so far. 
I'm disappointed in the Bitcoin Foundation, they should've known by even "just discussing" these issues they'd be drawing undeserved attention to Bitcoin.
I don't get their motives, at all. We were doing just fine before they showed up and got swollen heads about steering the good ship Bitcoin.

The problem with most alts is they "spin the dials" on the Bitcoin setting defaults, pop out a new logo and declare that they're open for business.
There's no "vetting" other than stumping for users to suck in to mine on their new chain. So, later, when scalability problems arise *(assuming they even make it that far)*, or other systemic problems occur, they're stuck - unless they can make changes and convince all of their userbase to switch.
It may seem similar to the Bitcoin process, but actually its worse, because most alt-coins have zero proof "in the field" as a working network, and are prone to problems from their "special" settings.
But, the desire to get rich quick is a powerful thing, so the users of these systems and their maintainers will be around for a while.
Just consider it a litmus test for critical thinking skills. Most alt-coins don't have any.

I think the clients will get to the point where it will be "thoughtless" - you initiate some actions and the heavy lifting occurs in the background.
We just haven't gotten there yet. I do take issue with personal security being some automatic non-thinking activity. I don't see how that can really change.
As in your examples, people can get 'phished' by email, have trojans install themselves via zero-day attacks, etc.. You have to have some concept of personal security and proper internet precautions. To suggest otherwise is a bit reckless.
You have to be observant while driving, the same will apply to electronic currencies - both can have rather dire consequences when left unattended.

Cross-posting for visibility:
User "adam3us" on Bitcoin talk put it best: (He invented distributed mining and its cited in Satoshi's whitepaper.)
Here's his take on it:
**Coin Validation misunderstands fungibility and could destroy bitcoin** Today at 01:30:51 PM
 
Its based on significant misunderstanding about bitcoins value proposition - destroy its fungibility and the costs float up to meet credit cards and paypal.
It is also a ridiculous approach. If they want to certify users, they should do that as optional KYC, AML certificates that regulated merchants in respective jurisdictions can request, which could be attached to wallets/identities, not to fully fungible coins. The certificates should be non-transitive they attest to the identity of the user, not the coins. They should be optionally sent - if the recipient does not request it, it is privacy destructive and a security risk to send identifying information to unregulated businesses and individuals.
Their technical representatives of Coin Validation should be ashamed. How can someone who doesnt understand a concept as basic as fungibility and its relation to transaction costs, and the difference between identity and coins hope to exist in this ecosystem.
What they are proposing so far at least as explained by the Forbes article is stupid, dangerous and just wrong.
I am also incensed frankly that someone would step into the market with such a muddle-headed thinking, and attempt to sabotage or destroy the core bitcoin feature that gives its value, where the value has been created by Satoshi and a cast of millions of man-hours of contributions of the community and technical wizards developing it mostly on volunteer time. I am not someone prone to swearing, but this is astonishingly stupid and dangerous. Please stop now. In the article it is claimed they sought advice from the Winklevoss twins, if the twins value their estimated $30million bitcoin holding they should advise them to stop: if fungibility is destroyed bitcoins value as a transaction currency is impacted.
I encourage anyone with technical skills to put their thinking caps on to find ways to increase fungibility in the short term like CoinJoin, coin control in wallets, helping less technical people migrate to better wallets, educating people about privacy practices that defend fungibility. And longer term privacy technologies like zero coin, homomorphic encrypted value and committed (hidden) transactions.
I encourage all bitcoin businesses to shun Coin Validation unless we see some major U-turn or corrections. If your business depends on the success bitcoin, it depends on the fungibility of bitcoin, and Coin Validation seem to be set on destroying both.
You can quote me on that.
I welcome Coin Validations corrections of the claims in the Forbes article. Tell me you were misquoted.
**My thoughts:**
I personally think Mike Hearn should be shunned from this community, along with any other idiot who thinks "Coin Validation" is a good idea.

There's also the possibility that another Gibson-like concept will come to pass, Data Couriers.
Meshnets across the world could be synchronized with daily updates, ferried across the oceans by people who already have to fly to cities across the world, paid for in BTC from a community-sponsored pool.
This isn't ideal, it isn't 'perfect', but it sure is hard to stop someone with a small USB flash drive, given existing storage densities. 1TB on a chip smaller than a fingernail is a reality, and the blockchain doesn't even need anything like that currently.
I still say we're better of starting somewhere, because I see the next strike against bitcoin won't be banks shutting down accounts, it will be ISPs pressured to screw Bitcoin to a wall.

Hi Litecoin - here's a reminder:
1) You haven't integrated the changes that fixes the hard-fork scenario.
2) Your shortened confirmation time results in more blockchain re-orgs (ie., the "orphaned block" problem we are seeing now)
3) It also makes your chain bloated in size - more blocks equals more storage requirements
4) If anyone gets on your alt-chain with a satoshi dice clone, you can kiss your blockchain size goodbye - as it races to the moon in size
I'm sure there's more - but I'd consider carefully if you decide to go into this particular alt-chain.

Being anonymous is an easier position to defend.
Never underestimate what we're up against - governments and people who will stop at **nothing** to put the entire idea into the ground, and keep it there.
That is why exposing the creator is dangerous - they will take any scrap from this person(s) life, and magnify/distort it to their ends. If there is nothing they can use, they'll fabricate it.
The stakes are amazingly high, which amplifies the severity of the situation.

This is precisely why all the "Bubblers" -- people who can't see past their own nose and keep yelling the same word over and over are fundamentally wrong.
This technology is going to change the face of finance and how people relate to money in general. It isn't the hyper-focus on a given valuation in a given sovereign currency that matters - what matters is the freedom that this tool provides and the global spread that it has enjoyed in such a short time.
We really are living in the future, but only some are aware of the potentials.

Yifu Guo gets how to operate a business in the bitcoin realm. At least in principle - I know the delays have been bothering batch buyers, but at least they shipped.
He shows that he "gets it" when he talks about bitcoin's valuation in other sovereign currencies - It is mostly irrelevant. Just a phase, and enables the network to gain more strength.
It is nice to see someone running a bitcoin business that isn't all about profit or "stress testing" the network or some other suit-like drivel.
Good on you, Yifu!

Thought I'd post this here - it may help you understand the potential gains bitcoin may achieve.
"Ten penny stocks that didn't stay that way"
While I think bitcoin has better odds than a penny stock making it to the "big board", look at these gains:
Concur Technologies (CNQR) +21,190%
General Growth Properties (GGP) +3,205%
Medifast (MED) +18,471%
Bitcoin multiplying in value many times over looks completely probable to me. As a quick calc, since we're about 4,000% above where we started, lets see what another 4,000% would be.
30.22 - Used as a starting price.
That would yield a price of $1,240 - a total increase of +8,000% and you still would be in real-world territory.
@_date: 2013-09-17 11:59:46
Actually, no.
Colored coins, a deeply flawed project that tries to trace transactions tied to a given party - thereby destroying anonymity *(pseudo or otherwise)* isn't what I'm talking about.
In programming, you can have things stand for other things. The easiest is to assign a value to variable - like a = 5. What I'm talking about is using Bitcoin as an encoded message, but you're using the amount to stand for something else, so 0.002 isn't 2 thousandths of a Bitcoin, in this case it means "I'm transferring 2k USD/JPY/Whatever to you, so mark your books accordingly".
They'd probably not go this route, just saying its possible.

There are some more rumours floating around. I think it reduces down to a few possibilities:
**1.)** The recent price surge is either a large player or a collection of smaller players trying to exit Gox.
**2.)** The recent price surge is a few large "whales" that have preferential status in Gox, so can transfer at ease. Not so if you're a "small fry".
**3.)** The premium spread means that transfer is indeed a convenient fiction, and arbitrage activity is nonexistent due to Gox being completely incompetent.
Pick your poison, unless volume really picks up at Gox I think they're in a death spiral where the spread increases to ludicrous levels. 
My guess is anything over 25% means they're circling the drain. *(Comparing mtgox over bitstamp).*

What I love about bitcoin and the markets that have sprung up around it is there's an extremely low barrier to entry. Want to daytrade? Sure, go for it - no $25,000 minimum in an account - you can take a go for whatever amount you're willing to put in.
This also exposes a lot of people to the intricacies of trading. Trading something is probably the most illuminating way to truly get to know yourself, especially under stress :)
I'm also encouraged that market depth is increasing on the major exchanges, a dump of bitcoins like that in 2011 or 2012 would've been nasty.

Anything with underlying value retains it. Anything that is a true speculative fiction goes to zero as the time premium has expanded dramatically at lower prices.

Bubbles tend not to recover from declines after major peaks. 
We blasted through the old all-time high and kept going. We will no doubt have large rallies and declines, but again - bubbles don't behave that way. Even if we busted down below double-digits, it isn't a bubble.
A bubble is when you go straight to zero, or some other price that is essentially zero in the amount of trading interest. (Which soon spirals down to nothing as it is abandoned.)
Trading newbies usually make the mistake of applying 'bubble' to anything that rallies. They're often wrong.

I don't know about 'niche'. The whole LTC thing would be fairly silly if re-cast in another context.
If I had a sports car that was pretty fast, but I wanted to upgrade the engine so it would be absolutely stunning, I wouldn't take that engine and slot it into the washing machine, just to get some use out of it.
The whole thing about 'using GPUs for something' just rings a bit hollow. Sure, you re-use older computers for personal servers and junk for a while, but honestly there is a point where there isn't any real 'life' to them anymore, and you get rid of it.
Clinging on to a particular method that is growing obsolete just doesn't seem like a good way to deal with progress. And this is entirely separate from whether LTC is 'worth' anything either.

It is more likely that governments will attempt to make access to the bitcoin markets more difficult, but I doubt any outright banning will occur.

It helps to view the percentage change as the **decrease** in earnings for all current miners. That's one hell of a hit.
A basic 60,000 Mhash/sec ASIC will be down to ~4 BTC a month when difficulty is over 210 Million.
When difficulty is over 430 million, only ~2 BTC a month.
When difficulty is over 800 million, only ~1 BTC a month.

It's also worth noting that Linden Lab squashed any attempts to use Linden Dollars to buy BTC on Virwox recently. Perhaps they got approached by someone needing a favor to stop *"money laundering"*?

I'd say showing that the financial system that we're **competing** with is a corrupt hairball of complicity and collusion actually *is* relevant to Bitcoin.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the US long-term yield curve was a rigged piece of shit. The Federal Reserve already owns **30%+** of that nightmare, and that's before they *"taper"* their immense capital injections.
So yeah, its all fucking relevant, because the entire system is likely to be rigged.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:57:27
This is also precisely why Litecoin won't scale worth a damn. Increase the number of 'checks' coming into a 'central bank' every few minutes, and you have parts of the network completely out of sync with what is happening elsewhere.
This leads to more chain-reorgs and such as the network grows larger. It is doubtful they could even approach half of what the Bitcoin network is now.

Here's some more detail on what is going on - pulled from bitcointalk.org, commentary by one of the core developers:






No such sites exist, they all have minimum plays larger than the value in question— no one has identified any actual currency usage believed to be affected by this.
The outputs impacted this generally cost more to redeem than they're worth... so there is basically no sane reason to create them except to add load to the system.




The bitcoin system doesn't have "accounts" every individual payment to you is totally separate as far as the system is concerned.  If txout value of X is economically unspendable (meaning it costs you more in fees marginally then it returns) then it's still economically unspendable no matter what other coins you have. You can think of them as coins with negative value: spending it makes you poorer because adding it to your transaction increases that transaction's fees by more than the value of Bitcoin it returns.  Giving you _more_ negative value coins doesn't help you productively spend your initial negative value coin.
The dust change doesn't change what you can spend— it just changes what outputs you can create— no more freaky costs more-to-spend-than-you-get-outputs, unless you can get cooperation from a miner or mine them yourself. For people who have less than that amount in total— well, they were already unable to spend them: transactions without any output value of less than 0.01 that doesn't pay a fee of at least 0.0005 BTC is has been non-standard for a long time (and previously required a 0.01 fee).




If you disable listening (listen=0 in the bitcoin.conf) that works around that pretty much entirely. That is not a replacement for additional flexibility in the long term, but it's really easily done. Things like adjusting client traffic can be twiddled over time, but unspendable data storage outputs are forever. As an aside— you might want to google bufferbloat, as it sounds like your local network could use some tuning.
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:18:04
Gox is undergoing some serious problems. They can only make **10 SWIFT TRANSFERS** a day. That is a cap on them by their bank. Any guesses on how this will go?
I can tell you.
Buy BTC with any existing cash balance, and transfer the hell out.
It isn't a coincidence that they are falling lower in overall volume even compared to 2011. People are bailing, and their inept PR and communication isn't helping them any.
I seriously think we're witnessing the order book emptying out, which will result in large swings from the last available bid/ask as it deteriorates.
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:13:37
It is amusing to see the muppets rush for the exit. I was wary, and so were a lot of other people about the rise. Can't say I 'timed' anything at all, just thought the price deltas were getting a bit steep.
If Gox can get its act together, things may even out. Last trade I saw lately was around 42.40
The irony is gox lagging out severely acted like its own market "time out". Except without the calming announcement, I guess. I wonder if they'll publish a post-mortem on what happened.

Most people getting into markets for the first time don't understand what the term "bubble" means.
An easier thing is to watch daily price action, if the trend starts to look like an exponential curve, you're getting into what technicians call a "blow off top" - which is pretty nasty on the downside.
Otherwise, price action marching up and having periodic downturns isn't a bad thing, that is how uptrends work.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:15:49
Logically, this is *precisely* why the recent lows don't go much lower than the prior parabolic rally high. 
As Bitcoins are distributed to more and more people, the percentage of these people who would have to participate on a one-sided trade diminish, probability-wise.
What's more likely, 100 people deciding to sell or 1,000? That's what is at work here, and it is simply brilliant.

You seem to love regulation. How did that work out for the Irish economy? The USA with the mortgage crisis? I could go on, but in these "fully regulated" markets, no errors were caught, no preventative measures taken. 
They just nodded off as the entire world went off the rails. Oh, and they got compensated all the same - great job, regulators!
How about all the failed "central governance" of sovereign central bank interventions? The absolute ludicrous waste of funds as Japan tried again and again to support their currency, most of the effect wiped away by the market a mere twenty-four hours later.
So, throw "tulips" around as much as you like, it won't change the fact that your two main criticisms can't stand up to the reality we all know - that regulation and central governance mean absolutely NOTHING.

I don't guess, I don't use *'gut feel'* in my trading. As for whether I'd use a stop and cut my losses on a five-dollar move - sure, if my stuff said we were decaying anyway and it would mean future hurt.
The point here is whether you have the tools that actually do what they should, indicate timing for trades. Any other plan that doesn't have a risk 'cap' for when you are wrong *(as no method is 100%)* is inviting disaster.
That's it, you don't have a plan, or worse, you change your plan to suit the whim of the market - just get it over with and throw your money out of the window.
The claim that having a plan that includes a risk cap guarantees buying the top and selling the low is highly dependent on the method you're using to set those orders to begin with, and **that** is my issue with that overly broad and misinformed statement.
Trade how you like, but holding at the wrong times and ignoring having an exit plan is just a recipe for disaster in my opinion.

Sure, they can make all the fiddly little choices about flavor A or B, or if they want to live in a certain apartment or rent/own a house, but at the end of it all you get down to how is much you **owe**, and how much you **make**.
Being able to have a certain level of "fuck you" money is very useful, because you don't have to be in that vicious circle anymore. This of course assumes you don't overspend and keep yourself on a track where you don't have to scramble for employment.
So, enjoy life and do the things you want to do, learn some new subjects, fool around with technology, hike up a mountain JUST BECAUSE. You know, things like that.

My problem with the whole "Bitcoin isn't *this* or *that* yet, therefore **FAIL**" statement is it doesn't make any sense.
Let me explain.
Lets say I want to open a restaurant, raising my own fish in sustainable enclosures. I'd go into detail about how I'd raise them to the peak of perfection, then a quick trip to the kitchen, where they'd be steamed or fried to be put on your plate.
If a critic of Bitcoin were to have at this idea - they'd say *"Why isn't your food here yet? You don't have any fish, I don't see any tables or anything -- **FAIL**."*
Bitcoin is just getting started. So when I see complaints about how Bitcoin isn't being the best thing ever, I have to wonder where is the personal restraint. 
Where is the acknowledgement that progress takes time? Is something really a complete failure because it isn't instantly successful/penetrated all markets/etc..?
Just seems awfully short-sighted.

This isn't playtime. This is for keeps. They say "dress for the job you want", well you should inform your brain before you engage a community that understands encryption, peer-to-peer networking and how conventional monetary policies are flawed.
Just bumbling in and saying "gosh, guys - so mean!" isn't going to cut it. If you don't like bitcoin and have a GOOD REASON that is backed by something other than vitriol, then we'll consider you seriously - and reply with illuminating facts why you're not in the right.

1) Possible vulns - well, we can just agree that there's a very low probability of that occuring. The problem with entertaining that scenario is the 0-day vulnerability would have to be hidden *so* well, that it could hide from intense scrutiny for the entire time the codebase is available.
2) Big Player Impact - throwing out the 51% scenario, if a large entity decided to go super-miner on us -- they'd enjoy about two weeks of hoovering up the majority of the 3,600 bitcoins mined every 24 hours, before difficulty spiked so hard it would negate their advantage. Could it disrupt? Sure, but the network has been quite robust, underlining its decentralized design.
We have no guarantee that it won't happen, but the inherent design qualities of the network doesn't allow for hash-rate bullies to prosper for long. Which is probably why we haven't seen that kind of behavior so far.
3) Transaction Volume - Sure, you could make the argument that a majority of bitcoin transfer is just 'juggling' from a owned address to another by the same person - but I doubt the *majority* of transactions are this kind of behavior. I can't prove it conclusively due to the bitcoin network design, but it does make sense logically that the transaction volume we're seeing isn't solely dominated by one kind of behavior.
It evokes the Pareto distribution analysis of large networks, such as 20% of the userbase is responsible for 80% of the coin 'juggling', or 20% of the top bitcoin holders have 80% of the collective wealth.
Hope that helps.

I wouldn't mind a tax bill that broke down like:
Local County/Municipality - Government Services Used
Retirement (opt in/out - plan your own or contribute govt administered one)
Defense - Amount needed for defending domestic borders only
Extra Projects/Line Items (opt-in and only contributed to if you truly support the idea or goal)

I'd settle for just knowing what the bid/ask is across the different exchanges. How about an Osiris Serverless Portal, where the trusted nodes are updated by the exchanges themselves? Then anyone can join in on the network and see a "big board" of bids/asks for reference.
So if one exchange goes nonlinear, at least we wouldn't be in the dark, and could use it as a guide to price our own dealings in the over-the-counter market, or personal trades.
If anyone has any better way to implement this, I'd really like to know... or just jump in and make it!

You do realize that bitcoin is open source, right? You also realize that it has been vetted by developers and crypto experts, right?
As far as 'outlawing', that would make bitcoin pretty much the go-to currency of the planet. When people see a power-grab like that, to suppress bitcoin - all bets are off, because they've acknowledged it as a threat.

See, that kind of reasoning doesn't sit well with me. If it was a cost issue, then they should've at least had the ABILITY to scale up when needed - not running server instances until they were required.
If it was lack of actual PLANNING, then that's even worse. "We never expected this kind of traffic" isn't a viable excuse, at least not for CEO's running companies that are meant to be robust and perform. If it was simply something like "We took longer to implement our capacity expansion plan than we thought" that's another thing.
Being down for a few hours in a 24 hour market is a disaster, and I come from a trading environment where 5 minutes is your boss calling you, 15 minutes is HIS boss calling you, and over a half hour the CEO is looking for answers - - and you're probably fired if you don't have the right one.

It could be someone sussing out the order book by 'pinging' with small amounts until something more serious gets triggered. Not sure what they achieve with that though - unless they're trying to take advantage of some arbitrage opportunity between exchanges.

@_date: 2013-02-21 22:28:10
1) The source has been scrutinized by leading cryptography experts and developers. To quote Bruce Schneier (regarding private key security the bitcoin wallet uses):
"...brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space."
The blockchain protocol has never been cracked. There is zero counterfeiting.
2.) 51% attack fallacy - even if the strongest of the strongest decided to 'gang up' against the current network, they'd have to spend immense amounts and keep INCREASING their share to have any measure of success. Oh, and the only thing they could do while having a 'majority' is maybe screw around with the coins that only THEY own, not anyone elses. There's a reason we haven't seen such an attack - it provides limited results and the costs aren't worth it.
3.) Volatility/Currency Usage - The markets at the "edges" are still maturing, so market depth isn't as high as the common equity markets - but give us a break, its only been around for a few years, not 75+ years like the Dow Jones. As for 'hoarding' - there's another pattern this matches - stacking precious metals and holding on to them. Its called "store of value". As for transactions, there are more services and available processors now than any other time in the past. I can't believe you'd make a claim that they aren't used - hell, I bought a gold reddit upgrade with bitcoins.
I suggest getting involved, because at this point in history every major sovereign currency is in a debasement race to the bottom, whether you like it or not.

People are also forgetting that China aren't just "those commies" anymore. If anything, their shift to market-based policies versus centralized control makes them even more capitalist-influenced than the West characterizes them to be.
That's what I fucking hate about the USA slant on everything, they're very slow to change their minds on what other countries represent.

"The central banks are a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're there, you look around, what do you see? 
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very wealth of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that banking system and that makes them our enemy. 
You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the banking system, that they will fight to protect it."
Except I'd add that it is only the people who refuse to accept that the financial system is one of control that makes them our "enemy".

I think they're right to a degree. Removing the human equation from monetary policy is the right move - every currency that has had solely human administration has ultimately failed.

Perhaps you'd like to catch up on the "Taper" talk. The only question is whether the timing is due to their own schedule, or the market finally having an explosive fit and driving yields past 3% on the 10-Year.

While bitcoin clients and sites could always stand a bit more "polish", I think its misguided to complain about something that is barely out of the gate. This isn't some multi-million dollar corporation with a large budget.
GUI will improve, all the superficial things that people look for in products they use with very little brainpower will be added. The core design of bitcoin is sublime, and it will power all of these future changes.
Perhaps in the end, you need to support or spur the change that you want to see, instead of merely whining about it.

The core developers are highly aware of developments in cryptographic algorithms. A more likely scenario would be another scheme would be selected and integrated into a release candidate before the prior method became obsolete.
Not every algorithm stands forever, and that is expected.

Perhaps you haven't had a close look at the actual law-versus-reality in the U.S.A.
There are two sets  - one that apply to the "little people" and one that applies to the rich.
If you're poor and you kill someone, you go to jail for a long time, possibly even executed.
If you're rich, you pay your lawyers immense fees and get off with a slap on the wrist, or some kind of settlement.
If you're a small business owner and you have a flawed business plan, you go bankrupt with nobody to help you.
If you're a large business that makes large sums, you can get a bailout from the banks/govt to keep running. *(Oh hello General Motors!)*
And don't even get me started on the abuses the banks can get away with.
That's the plain truth, there are two facets of reality and they don't look anything like each other. Its great that you are cherry picking the examples that actually made it, but the stark reality is most people fail under this "fair" system.

The answer is simple. Its "amateur hour" over at Mt. Gox. Hell, they don't even have an actual streaming quotefeed that is built to scale effectively.
 Its this piecemeal API that if deployed in the real financial world, would fall over in a few seconds flat, no matter what their "matching engine" can do.
I don't know Mark, but from what I've read and heard through other channels, I get the impression of someone who is living rather comfortably, and really would rather be coding on another project. He's probably thinking about doing an MMO, not working on Gox.
The problem with the usual coder-detachment syndrome is when they get bored of working on something, there are no more improvements and things just get "tacked on" to satisfy immediate complaints.
The whole monetary transfer problem is a combination of their own ineptitude and the growing unease of their banking partners, however it is a big debate on how many of these problems are simply being caused by Gox dropping the ball, and not the other way around.
Given their horrendous PR, which I would outsource **IMMEDIATELY** if they want to have a prayer of retaining their customers, I just see someone who got in at the right time, and now realizes they're really in over their head, and they have little to no clue as to what they should really be focusing on.
The first real exchange that comes along that has an actual FIX-compliant API and other "big iron" to handle real trading volumes is going to **bury** Gox, and I think they know it.

It's called "variance". You know that thing where people find several blocks in a row? That would blow this "attack" out of the water.
If the evil people have N+1 blocks, and thanks to variance the good actors find N+2 blocks and broadcast it, then this whole thing falls on its face as a way to undermine Bitcoin.
Satoshi wasn't an idiot, even though some academics seem to be.

Sure. Litecoin is a dial-twiddling bitcoin clone that upped the confirm rate at the network's expense, namely more blockchain re-orgs and orphaned blocks. 
While this doesn't seem to be a big problem now, if the network grows any bigger these problems will result in parts of the network following a different chain fork than the other, with hilarious consequences as everyone churns to merge the "proper" block into the longest chain.
In short - a non-scaleable shitstorm is in LTC's future.

I think this is reasonably written, and I disagree with a few of the statements.
**Code** - The distinction here is the difference between an unscheduled upgrade and one that has to be made NOW, like the past hard-fork situation. My inclination is that the percentage of planned upgrades should exceed any emergency measures.
**Exploits** - Can't argue with this, anything with value gets targeted - plan accordingly. The redesign of the bitcoin.org site has helped a lot with this, and reddit/forums as well.
**Govt Ban/Intervention** - This is a big one, my theory is that any ban would cause people to go underground and continue - but they'd probably refrain from transferring out of the bitcoin ecosystem. In one way, this could actually accelerate adoption by businesses outside of the given nation's ban. I personally doubt an outright ban will occur.
**Corporate Sabotage** - I agree that we'll see some interesting competitive maneuvers. Some may try to ride the system's success, others will attempt to tear it down. From DDoSes of popular services to other underhanded dirty tricks. It all comes down to how bitcoin services are constructed and how well they operate in their country of origin.
**Fundamental Flaws** - It is my hope that either through a planned upgrade to the blockchain mechanics, or changed user patterns that we may alleviate this strain on the system. It is a high-level issue that the developers know about, and I expect some kind of progress on this.
Mining guilds have a vested interest in not becoming too dominant, and we've seen that in the voluntary self-regulation of the largest ones. I would expect that to continue at the very least.
It is certainly an interesting time to be alive, and I can't wait to see what the future brings.

Apple locks down their stuff so you can't do anything that might compromise their corporate sovereignty over you, the user. Anyone who doesn't understand computing - in the sense of being able to program, etc.. thinks this is just fine, because they don't need "all that extra stuff" anyway.
They just want to tap on an icon and play their games, give up all their information to NSAbook, and make sure they can post geo-tagged pictures on social services.
I say they deserve every single bit of derision that they get, coasting through life in their parallax flat-icon haze. They deserve to pay the inflated premiums on hardware, the fees when they need an Apple "Genius" to solve something, the money when their phone-made-of-mostly-glass breaks.

Trendlines or regression-fit lines don't predict, they indicate in a simplified way what the current price progression is. If people are using them to predict - that is flawed. Trendlines are useful for staying in a trend when you have a position on, using it as a ruler to see where you're at.
As for chart patterns, some can be useful - especially realizing when you're in an exponential/parabolic move that can break down suddenly after a rise - but others are just hugely subjective and don't produce any actionable trading decisions.
To condemn it all is a mistake. Even statistical evidence suggests the distribution of price data isn't a random walk - it doesn't fit the normal gaussian distribution (bell curve) very well. The mean is usually higher and there are more excursions to the 'tails' that can't be explained.
If you're familiar with the Hurst exponent, a measure of past changes influencing future changes, you'd know that price series display a persistent reading above 0.5 (randomness), usually in the range of 0.7 to 0.8 - what this all means is that price does have an effect on what prices will be tomorrow. This is why certain techniques can work, and do so reliably.

The real problem is fear.
Fear that everything they've been told is just a varnished lie. Fear that their money isn't what they thought it was, the digits in their bank account just a convenient fiction that could be a mirage at any moment.
Any time I compare sovereign currencies to bitcoin, it makes me want to put more into bitcoin, because at least there it can't be abused by power-hungry morons.
We will prevail, but then that is when you'll see the fear turn into pure hate.

Your brain is like a CPU, and its 'clock speed' samples the universe at a given rate. You are constantly living in the *past*, because it takes a fraction of a second for impulses from your senses to be decoded by your brain.
If your reality is really an echo of what is happening now, and your sample rate decreases as you age - you end up with a perception of time *increasing* in speed, where a month seems like barely anything compared to when you were younger and an hour was **forever**.
Time may just be a construct in our own ability to comprehend the universe, and there is an argument to be made that everything is/was/has happened, we just don't have the ability to "see" it, hence our linear approximation of time.

If Western Union were money-grabbing bastards, they would probably do it like this:
(Sovereign Currency Source)===&gt;(Internal Bitcoin Transfer)===&gt;(Destination - Sovereign Currency Payout)
So they mask the use of bitcoin from the end-users, but enjoy the benefits of having a low-fee transaction network that has triple-accounting and timestamps. 
This would also allow them to only buy a small amount of bitcoins to send around - the most cost effective way would be to develop a signaling type of transaction that encodes the actual amount involved without using a lot of coins in the process.
So, sending 1 million somewhere for a large transfer would only be 0.16 BTC, where the tenths is millions and hundredths is the number of zeros. Any kind of method could be used to do this - just an off-the-top-of-the-head example.

I'd check the wiki, but I think you've read it from some of the questions you have.
The initial hype-rally in 2011 happened due to a lot of new users, one exchange that was handling all the volume, (others weren't nearly as big) and a well-publicized site hack caused an artificial plunge afterward. Most of that is pretty well documented.
CPU to GPU - programmers took a look at openCL and realized they could leverage GPU power to do massively parallel computation, increasing the overall hashrate by a few orders of magnitude. This is also the force behind transitioning to ASIC architecture, which uses less power for an even higher leap.
Bitcoin's economy is pretty resilient - it could take the same things that could nail the entire internet to 'kill' bitcoin. Any scenario like that is pretty unlikely - but I suppose you can see the "Myths" section in the wiki to see what they are. Also, a rich account holder losing their wallet would only serve to increase the value of everyone's coins, since it is inherently deflationary.
Bitcoin is volatile because most of the exchanges don't have good order book depth - except perhaps MtGox. This is the nature of markets that are just starting. This will mature and improve over time.
Alt-coins aren't really close to bitcoin's collective hash-power or serve any particular purpose that bitcoin doesn't - so they've mostly languished and aren't doing much beyond tweaking some global variables for unknown reasons.
The "cheated" comment is the 51% attack - but as it is pointed out on the wiki, you can only do bad things with your coins, and it takes ever-increasing resources to keep up. We've never seen anyone attempt it, and as network hashpower increases that probability reduces to near-zero.
The bitcoin protocol has been rock-solid. Any minor issues in the clients are addressed and corrected. Open source engineering at its finest.
"Bitcoin Days Destroyed" is probably the worst name anyone could've thought of - it doesn't relate the real purpose, which is to see if old coins are moving around the network, or being simply hoarded.
That's about it.

Got to give him credit. He's cautiously optimistic, which fits with his way of analyzing things. I look forward to more when he's more familiar with the bitcoin network.

His premise is that government will shut down bitcoin, in addition to the current sovereign currency fueled crisis such as the Euro - which he thinks will affect Bitcoin as well.
Its just a more "polite" hit-piece that emphasizes the "what ifs" without going into detail about how those assumptions are flawed.
Bitcoin may be a risk, but I assure you nation-state currencies are much more risky than bitcoin is.

Taking the range of 13.40 - 19.00, it was interesting to see that the current low bounced right on the fibonacci retrace of that range - 61.8% ~15.60 before heading higher.
The volatility was something to behold, we usually don't have several dollar moves in one price bar over 24 hours. My guess is we stabilize around 17.00 and work our way sideways.

Its okay, I don't expect you to understand. By your reasoning the Gulf Oil spill was just an unavoidable petrochemical "oopsie".
Just like SatoshiDice treating the whole blockchain like their own personal global variable storage is just and kind.

Is that assuming zero breakthroughs in computing technology? Graphene has impressive qualities that we may yet harness, in addition to room-temperature "hall effect" conductors based on specific formulations of nickel/tin. *(That means zero resistance in circuit traces, by the way).*
We tend to double our processing power along the lines of "Moore's Law", without having to use as much power as before, so that is why I question your pessimistic viewpoint.

Seems like someone is trying awfully hard to justify the many different pieces of this "protocol". More stuff is better?
Okay, how about for every Disastercoin transaction we have a bank of VOIP answering machines spread across the internet, and if you contact three of them and they say "OKAY - SPEND FUNDS" you can do so.
Anyone getting the sense that this hairball is turning into a complete and utter piece of crap?

Actually in a perfect world - an asshole wouldn't make a company that exploits everyone's bandwidth and cpu, also doesn't cash out like it isn't a big deal -- when around 125k BTC is at stake.

User "adam3us" on Bitcoin talk put it best: *(He invented distributed mining and its cited in Satoshi's whitepaper.)*
Here's his take on it:
	
**Coin Validation misunderstands fungibility and could destroy bitcoin**
Today at 01:30:51 PM
Its based on significant misunderstanding about bitcoins value proposition - destroy its fungibility and the costs float up to meet credit cards and paypal.
It is also a ridiculous approach.  If they want to certify users, they should do that as optional KYC, AML certificates that regulated merchants in respective jurisdictions can request, which could be attached to wallets/identities, not to fully fungible coins.  The certificates should be non-transitive they attest to the identity of the user, not the coins.  They should be optionally sent - if the recipient does not request it, it is privacy destructive and a security risk to send identifying information to unregulated businesses and individuals.
Their technical representatives of Coin Validation should be ashamed.  How can someone who doesnt understand a concept as basic as fungibility and its relation to transaction costs, and the difference between identity and coins hope to exist in this ecosystem.  
What they are proposing so far at least as explained by the Forbes article is stupid, dangerous and just wrong.  
I am also incensed frankly that someone would step into the market with such a muddle-headed thinking, and attempt to sabotage or destroy the core bitcoin feature that gives its value, where the value has been created by Satoshi and a cast of millions of man-hours of contributions of the community and technical wizards developing it mostly on volunteer time.  I am not someone prone to swearing, but this is astonishingly stupid and dangerous.   Please stop now.  In the article it is claimed they sought advice from the Winklevoss twins, if the twins value their estimated $30million bitcoin holding they should advise them to stop: if fungibility is destroyed bitcoins value as a transaction currency is impacted.  
I encourage anyone with technical skills to put their thinking caps on to find ways to increase fungibility in the short term like CoinJoin, coin control in wallets, helping less technical people migrate to better wallets, educating people about privacy practices that defend fungibility.  And longer term privacy technologies like zero coin, homomorphic encrypted value and committed (hidden) transactions.
I encourage all bitcoin businesses to shun Coin Validation unless we see some major U-turn or corrections.  If your business depends on the success bitcoin, it depends on the fungibility of bitcoin, and Coin Validation seem to be set on destroying both.
You can quote me on that.
I welcome Coin Validations corrections of the claims in the Forbes article.  Tell me you were misquoted.
**My thoughts:**
I personally think Mike Hearn should be shunned from this community, along with any other idiot who thinks "Coin Validation" is a good idea.

Two volatile subjects in one:
**1. Money** - How much you have, or not, determines a lot of things. Questioning how money is made and distributed is a big one, even if you don't offer a replacement.
**2. Freedom** - Some people want everything laid out in regulations and laws. Others just want a simpler society based on not harming other people. However you define it, being free to follow your own desires is a very basic and crucial element in being alive.

To your points:
1) Back-door being probable - I suppose a broken dish can leap up into your hand and reassemble as well (quantum mechanics allows, but at a very low probability) :)
2) 51% attack - I think you need to dive in at the wiki, but this has been explained elsewhere, so I'm not making it up. Sorry if the method of explaining this wasn't as clear as you'd like it to be.
3) I compared markets because you were citing volatility, immature markets have high volatility because of low order book depth, mature markets have less for the inverse reason.
I then went on to discuss bitcoin as a store of value, not just a method for making transactions. That would explain the other terms you read. The most precise definition is - bitcoin is a hybrid currency/payment system. I'd probably add store of value to that as well, due to the proof-of-work algorithms involved to prevent counterfeiting.
You say they aren't being used - but then anyone monitoring the blockchain wouldn't see many transactions, would they? And the blockchain itself wouldn't grow in size.
All available evidence shows that transaction volume is increasing, and so is the blockchain - since it stores them all.

Take a look at these numbers:
Think the USA can shut down all of China? Or any of the other top countries?
I don't think they can - bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2013-09-12 03:46:58
See, I take umbrage at this kind of thinking. 20% chance? Are we comparing Bitcoin to **other** cryptographically-based currency/payment systems?
I think not.
Bitcoin is so **fundamentally** different that any comparison is nearly impossible. All you can do is identify the strengths and weaknesses, and compare them directly.
Every day that Bitcoin exists is another increment of its "chance" of succeeeding. Every added full verification/processing node is another increment to its overall strength.
I find his lack of logic rather disturbing.

Its for people who have millions already, which is largely out of reach for the typical investor that would be trading the Winklevoss ETF - so there really isn't a comparison here.
