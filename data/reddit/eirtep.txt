I think this is great advice. Just forget about it for a bit. the problem is, looking at the charts is fun so sometimes it's tricky :(


also makes sense to me. if you're throwin in a few hundred bucks or whatever - or whatever amount of money that is relative to your financial situation just assume it's gone. It's like going to a casino - bring the amount of money you're comfortable with losing and assume you will lose it.  Casinos are fun, gambling is fun, so if/when you lose it just factor that in as if it was the cost of said fun. 
if you're gonna put in a little money and then stress every minute and make yourself sick over it what's the point?
maybe someone disagrees but that's how I see it at least, as some that isn't ALL IN financially (sorry op).

As much as I want all the answers too, I think this is exactly the type of post that wont do well here unfortunately. we can't say for sure and everyone's different as far as the rinks they're willing to take, how much of a safety net they have, what "comfortable" means, etc.

I'm a novice in this, but doesn't this practice relate to traditional stock more? Like I see it applied here and that's more or less what I've been doing but recently with 1k/30% ish growth a *day* doesn't that kind of fuck up averages?

What’s a long shot ? The us govt shuts down like every few years. We had one in 2013. I don’t think he meant like permanently.
