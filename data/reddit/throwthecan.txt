The biggest problem is affordability in my opinion.
There are no reliable low cost ATMs, which means that most operators charge a lot for this service, while often ignoring how alienating it is for the public.

It depends only on the population to make it exchangeable locally, so I find your point moot.
Bitcoin in its early stage is still a lot more useful now - you can spend it on the internet, or cash them out somewhere else - than any greek banks or centralized payment solutions.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:35:25
You could buy it with sepa on bitcoin forums, search for reputable traders.
Credit cards are not an option as they are reversible.

That's impossible. No sane bitcoin holders would want it 1MB capped.
I think this debate is highly overrated and mostly FUD.

You would require a global effort involving all bitcoin companies (and users) to make illicit activity unviable (or kyc on the protocol level).
As long as you can create keys and able to transact freely bitcoin will be used for illegal activities.
Anoncoin shills usually can't comprehend the fact that the obscured blockchain is the least important aspect to keep one's privacy intact.
Monero and all the other coins require the same additional procedures as bitcoin to use anonymously.
Their size and utilization does not help their case either, not to mention marketing and legal difficulties.

It was known that eth trading will start on kraken.
Everyone anticipated a fair launch, and it turned out that they require 6000 confirms for the ether to be credited to accounts, or equal btc/fiat balance.
During the trade launch ether was immediately appeared on the exchange though.
It traded slightly above 0.01 and crashed to the current level, 0.003.

The chinese stock market crashed due to central planners creating money from thin air, what they funnelled to their cronies. This leads to malinvestments (bailouts - more money created from nothing and channelled to cronies) and huge bubbles (simplistic explanation).
This practice is unsustainable and creates a toxic investment culture, and the recent crash is a symptom of this.
As for the implications for bitcoin: It should motivate people to seek safeheavens worldwide. Considering the current size and the scarcity of bitcoin, it doesn't take a lot of people to move the exchange rate.

Do you really think that it needs to be postponed until it becomes a problem? This is yet another argument with very shaky foundations.
Check the number of internet connected users. The current limit could be saturated by natural adoption quickly.
There are likely events which could easily cause spiking user adoption. We need time to work out the best ways to scale.


While I understand these concerns, I would love to see actual tests and numbers which prove that 8MB would make any of these a real threat.


The smaller the network the easier it is to do. Btw, every single thing involves risk including sticking to the crippling 1MB limit. No pain no gain.

In analogy, for-profit bitcoin mining is like for-profit gold mining. It doesn't make sense on a small scale.
Buying or earning btc always made more sense financially.

Apples and oranges.
Bitcoin is still small but it has the best distribution and most users.
Miners invested a lot of money in their operation, and they risk crashing their business if they do something against the users.
There is no reason to buy altcoins except speculation.

Buying altcoins is not diversification. Buying gold, stocks, properties, etc is.
Your belief is analogous to saying that you'll diversify your gold holdings into silver. :)

I disagree. There are a lot of utilities for bitcoin already.

Others use it to buy stuff they can't with fiat or to avoid restrictions and frictions of the old system.

Considering that there are no mechanisms to collect collateral, both are equally risky.
They are full of useless trading and mining loans so the most time consuming part is to filter down the opportunities.
Most scammers build their reputation by taking out several loans and paying them back, so the scoring system is almost useless.
Do not risk more than you can afford to lose.

It's like gold mining. You could attempt it on a small scale but it won't be profitable compared to large scale operations.
The state of mining has been also severely affected by greedy and criminal elements like BFL, cointerra, KNC and many others who collected money from people and mined with the devices instead of sending it out to customers.

A few scenarios:
1. The value of btc stays the same (wealth preservation)
2. The value of btc goes up (profit)

5. Maybe there will be an utility which you can use in the future (spending, donating, investing)
