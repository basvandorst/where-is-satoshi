The delivery man needs him to sign off (so Bob must use his cellphone or something to scan), so that means status of delivery will be marked as "Complete", thus BTC can be released. (Might be a little complicated to implement that though).

I mean, yeah I guess that's true, but if Bob gets scammed, couldn't he declare the fraud to ebay, who can then take care of it, like they usually do? 
"You could use already existing tracking to verify delivery however." &lt;-that's actually what I meant haha, sorry if I worded that wrong.

Well, alibaba is a chinese company, so with the uncertainty of cryptocurrencies, probably not a good idea for now.

Sorry for late reply, but i meant because if the owner of the establishment accept btc as payment, they would essentially have to just receive the payment through their wallet address and no fiat transaction was made like it does with paypal or visa or debit. Therefore this is like a barter and sales tax shouldnt exactly apply?
Would the BTC be converted to fiat? Or does the owner just keep the BTC and dish out his own fiat to compensate for the BTC payment?
