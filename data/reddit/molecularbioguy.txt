Agrarian Justice is what first first opened my mind to socialism, as a young person indoctrinated by incessantly blaring talk radio (not by my choice). Thomas Payne really was ahead of his time.
Feudalism: no economic freedom. Normal folks born into serfdom and life of toil as all land and resources are owned. America creates opportunity from new land, but what happens in future generations when all land is owned? Me: f***. Payne: there should be a tax on land to compensate the next generations for the loss of common heritage of man. Me: But But redistribution welfare socialism bad... Payne: Landed monopoly creates the dispossessed and impoverished. Me: and by extension all resource and exclusionary monopolies... Payne: redistribution as loss indemnification. Me: ok. Payne: Also, private charity is never enough. Me: should probably have realized this sooner.

You'd probably want to hire a lawyer and an accountant. Split your btc between as many exchanges as you can legally use. Talk to your banks so they know the money is coming is legally, from what sources and when. Then withdraw to the limit each exchange will let you. Talk to exchanges to increase withdrawal and deposit limits.

Those gains aren't fully realized until you've sold.
1% of the wallets control half the currency. Only so much can be sold at a time without dropping the price. When will the 1% sell?

So... both up and down... the price on different exchanges is going to diverge, is that the takeaway? Haha
