Remember when everybody was celebrating some guy who mortgaged his house to buy bitcoin and made a lot of money?

At first I was like "Interesting that 'Ponzi' would be the name of a spokesman for the Treasury Department" but then I realized it was just ideological bullshit in the article.

At the risk of being downvoted, I should say that it probably doesn't make sense to just add bitcoin alongside normal methods of payment. So far, not very many people use bitcoin and those who do probably have the know-how to pirate the music you distribute. If you want to be forward-thinking though, implement bitcoin along-side a new distribution model. This makes sense because bitcoin users have already demonstrated that they are comfortable being early adopters. Take one of your artists with a small, but rabid fan-base. Put up a note on your website that their next album will be released for free once x amount of bitcoin (or dollars) are "donated". Done right, this could generate publicity and good will for your label, the artist, and bitcoin, while making still making money.

You're getting some shit because this got linked to by and because you're implicitly criticizing the ideologies held by many people on Some of your ideas sound like they are partially encapsulated by the concepts of the "ownership society" and the role of inflation in the fiat money world. Furthermore, if you're going to riff off of Picketty, you have to show from foundations (i.e. do the math) that capital can be segmented like that without screwing up the rest of the mathematical edifice behind model-based economics, and that your claims therefrom hold true.
It sounds like you're doing some creative thinking though, which is more than can be said for 99.9% of the people on either or and you should not be deterred even though the real world does not much appreciate novel thoughts even if you do make the effort to flesh out the rigor.

I literally had this idea.

That's good to know!

Yes, but instead of all those cycles being wasted, they will have instead been used to increase humanity's knowledge of the universe. (Assuming this works as advertised.)

Actually, I don't know whether the IRS is okay with counting BTC payments as tax-deductible donations, but it's money well spent in any case.

Yup, you're going to want to contact your elected representatives.

You are conflating two different things. One is calculus the mathematical construct, and the other is physics. The first Newton conjectured and pursued an intuitive demonstration of (coincident with Leibniz) but in fact did not prove - rigorous approaches to Real Analysis did not happen for centuries. The second, actual physics, which makes assertions about things that take place in the real world, does in fact require evidence, which Newton had. Austrians don't. That's what makes Austrian economics a pseudoscience.

At first I thought I was in r/academiceconomics or something, and after reading the comment by u/cunicula essentially debunking the whole study, I couldn't figure out why this had so many upvotes. Then I saw that I was in r/bitcoin. Then I saw the Austrian-worship in the comments. Then I wept for humanity.

Raving schizophrenics will say something right if you listen to them long enough, too. However, this is not the case here - see u/cunicula's post debunking this entire study.
