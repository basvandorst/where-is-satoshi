I've deleted my .electrum dir and restarted:
./electrum  &amp;
 and it works now.
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:21:55
That's it. Fudge. I had a mistake in it.
Electrum wasn't reporting a problem, there was a missing digit.

I suppose Armory is solid? It's a bit bigger, I need to download the whole freaking blockchain. (At some point, it won't be practical for normal users to do, only dedicated hardware/servers)

Hi Folks
I have an offline wallet and an online wallet. I've just fed my public master key into my online wallet but I still don't see any addresses under my receive tab
(Windows 7)
I see it still "synchronizing" but I was expecting it to generate this quickly just as it did on my offline wallet. Why is this taking so long ((more than an hour) and how long can i expect this to show any addresses?

How about "moto" or "naka" for 1 uBTC
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:24:57
Did you copied the seed?
What version was it ? How long ago was that?

But if I go on "receive tab", it shows no address.
If I ask for the public master key, it does display the correct one.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:42:21
what do you use?
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:32:24
I'm not sure I understand the point of that.
This kind of story could also have come from any semi-pro free market democrats forced to live in North Korea, or USSR when still there. You are forced to since there is no other choice there, doesn't mean you agree to it.
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:23:13
I tried that. I don't have a single address showing on my online read only wallet. Only my offline wallet shows addresses, 5 as you said.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:46:48
What about multibit? I like the principle of seed
Armory is too big, I don't want to download the whole blockchain

It's best Wall Street stays out, so make it a thousand steps.

Pal, what's your problem?!?!

Govt monopoly is not the solution.
But, aren't we only debating about income tax here, not property taxes?
public schools, roads, firefighters, police, are all served by a city and county and funded from property taxes, not income taxes.
As for social programs, medicaid, medicare, govt are inefficient with this - as with anything else - and these are broke. If you are in your 20s and 30s, or even 40s, forget about social insecurity, their won't be much any. 
Just today, the amount received by a typical retiree is a fraction (in purchasing power) of what it used to be in the 50s and before.

That book's website is  
For anyone interested
(Available on online store, and in PDF on the website)
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:43:24
Now too in paper. A 394 pages book available in PDF ebook or at Amazon in softcover.

Unfortunately that doesn't work. I've tried that multiple times.
I don't know what's going on.
Thanks anyway

That's likely M0.  But you have to consider M1, M2, and M3
M1 is $12 Trillion at the very least.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:08:15
LOL.  THanks for the morning laugh!
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:39:50
Great story! Yes, indeed, thanks to Paypal.
Thanks also to the Cypress banks telling everyone to watch for bail-ins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:28:37
Very good point!

Abbreviation of mBTC is great, but saying it is too long.
I've heard someone talking about calling micro bitcoins as "Ringo".  Not sure if the best, but we need no more than 3 syllables, ideally just 2.

And the large majority of people don't know how the dollar is created and moves around either... does that prevent them from accepting it? (Granted, they have to at the point of a gun from the IRS, but still)

Trade with a local bitcoin holder
I think that's called
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:37:06
The 84 millions to make it easier for transactions is totally bogus.  If/when litecoin gets to say $100, or $1000, what then? Same "issue" we have with bitcoin - a bogus issues since bitcoin has mBTC and uBTC.
The part I don't know is how much of an advantage (today or in the future), could scrypt really give.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:10:21
This guy thought about that too, with the S-curve adoption rate. Same happened with the radio, the tv, etc. 
 
It seems a valid point.

Anyone can help out here? I'm getting no answers on the bitcoin forum about this. 
Basically, when will this alert be integrated in the Bitcoin client, this alert is mentioned in this article: (See section 5.3):
 
The addition of a "double spending alert" will basically help ensure with a good level of confidence after, say, a 20 seconds wait, that the bitcoin transaction will be secured. 
Nobody replied on the forum to this question - I would expect the main developer to provide some input.
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:07:16
Done some search, found 
and 
I'll read them. Thanks!

"I think paperwallets will be the perfect gift this xmas."
Funny, I had the same idea and I'm actually planning this to do tomorrow.

Which country/state was that?
