I can't see anyone saying that running Doom on means it was "hacked", just lots of people who don't understand anything about security. 
I can also see clear evidence that the coins have been removed.
Kind of looks a lot like you didn't even read the linked article.

So you read one article that's incorrect, and now you are an expert. 
Why lie?
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:28:28
Coins were taken. Why are you talking about doom?

The definition of "hacked" isn't for a company to redefine.

You said coins were not removed from the wallet.

He is wrong. 
The exploit just needs the device plugging into a malware infected machine to charge. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:59:15
It means that someone at some point during the life of the device has access.

That's not the definition of physical access though, so, no, it's not effectively physical access. 
Malware, social engineering, and evil chargers can all be used - no requirement for the attacker to be present.

Odd. It shows as page not found for me, and I can't see it on history either.

It is a hugely important distinction. 
Can the attack be carried out without the attacker touching the device?
Yes. 
Does it need anything more than plugging it into a USB port? No.
This makes it much more dangerous that an attack where they need to touch it, open it, connect specialist hardware to it.

It appears the rebuttal has been deleted.

Which law?

Because it is linked into the reservation system which connects to booking agents, so that the manual work of managing hundreds of cards is significantly lowered. This stops common mistakes being made.
