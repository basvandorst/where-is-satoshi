If anyone else is wondering about the responstime I can add that I got respons on my ticket after about 14 hours. Not to bad.
Can also add that I the support did a really good job helping me out. So a star in Bitpandas book from me!

Prove it!

Or maybe it because multiple 100%-gains each month demands a shitload of new and dumber money to maintain? And the last idiot has spent all his cash for now?

Thanks. Will check out crypto- and ethtrader. Have been lurking on bitcoinmarkets but are not whitelisted yet so I am basically discussing with myself due to the long approval time :)
But guessing other subreddits also have this whitelist function.

Yes. :) Stick to the plan is allways smart...but not allways to easy to do. 
Sometimes the plan changes along the way.
But a clear enty and exit point is, for me, the most important part of any plan.

Not to crush your dreams but there are some errors in your assumption.
1. Bitcoin is not the thecnology, blockchain is. So adoption of blockchain is rising but that does not rise the demand for bitcoins.
2. This curve depending on common people take the tech in use. I do not see that happends anytime soon with bitcoin. As for now bitcoin transactions are both to slow and expensive for the big mass to start using it. Not to mention it is still somewhat complicated to use for non tech people.
3. Increasing competition from other good altcoins can make bitcoin less exclusive and therefor less expensive.
4. My thinking is that bitcoin price is mainly driven by speculation and trading and not  the fundamentals.

That is a good strategy. But I do find it convenient to have a part of my portfolio in FIAT. Even though I agree that FIAT is not a good value storage over time, I still think "Cash is King" as a temp safe haven in volatile times and still, for me at least, the best way to take out profit.

I am not question the use of Bitcoin. But just stating the fact that the bullrun inn all Cryptos lately need constant refill of new money in order to ceep rising. And that will not go on forever.
But if you are saying that it is developing countries that is fuelling the price, I do not understand why a "crash plan", timed to US and EU bank holidays would work..

Yes. In the long run I think we can agree about Bitcoin and other Cryptos will be usefull. But bout the reason for the pricedrop we do not have the same meaning...but we will never know exactly why it drops or rises.

I totally agree. This could wery well be a bubble and all the classical signs of a bubble is present. A lot of new and nervous money in play could wery easy lead to crashmageddon as soon as the first big correction comes and panic kicks inn.
That said - for the same reason you dont put all your FIAT into coins - dont put all your coins into FIAT.  Cuz nobody knows where this is heading.

Wordpress with Woocommerce is a good platform to build a small webstore on. If you have somewhat technical knowledge you can set this up in a matter of minutes.
As for BTC payment I have never set this up my self but see woocommerce have at least one plugin for this (Will assume there are more out there.)

Well we are somewhat in the same boat then. My stop order kicked in  on stamp on the last dip/consolidation. In retrospect: if I have set my stop just a bit lower I would still be in the game with my trading coins.
But in my opinion: profit is never wrong, and it is nearly impossible to hit the absolute top or bottom.
And fuckups? If you are trading actively, get used to it. :) Just make sure your wins are greater than your fuckups and you will come out with profit.
