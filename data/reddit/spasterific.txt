Isn't Rick Falkvinge going along with the scam too these days?
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:55:11
The whole thing?
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:15:18
Be very wary of being tricked into buying cryptocurrency that *isn't* Bitcoin but happens to have the word 'Bitcoin' in its name / marketing (mostly to mislead and defraud newbies).
@_date: 2019-03-10 22:49:18
I find QR codes really difficult to type.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:38:31
I'd do exactly the same thing - keep hodling an unknowable (from the government's perspective) amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:09:53
Did you redo the mascot yourself? That's a really well-done version of him.
@_date: 2019-03-09 05:43:27
I would rather everyone had permission. Luckily though, they don't need to.
@_date: 2019-03-02 12:01:16
It didn't.
@_date: 2019-03-06 11:53:34
I suspect it's not even an unpopular opinion, just the opinion of people who aren't loudmouths and attention-seekers.
Edit: I take it aaaaaaall back, if the opinion must include this part:


Aaaaah, burn that with fire!
@_date: 2019-03-17 05:30:47
That was beautiful.
@_date: 2019-03-11 06:08:05
She wasn't wrong though.
I'm sure it *still* sounds like a scam to most people.
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:17:43
a.k.a. KILL YOUR COMPANY... because of the boycott situation. People will naturally gavitate to less intrusive businesses.

Or whenever you stay at home.
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:04:51
Well, I can't say for 100% certain, but I *don't remember* thinking it was a scam when I learned of it in ~2011. For me it was basically non-freezable e-gold, an uncensorable AlertPay, a non-shut-downable Liberty Reserve. It was an anti-scam, a saviour, when everything else (digital currency-wise) was seemingly falling apart.
Having said all that though, I still wouldn't claim to "truly understand crypto" :)

Goa trance fan? The art style actually matches somewhat well with [Martin Freeland]( music.
My fave was always his "Greece 2000" remix.

Like I said, oblivious. This is one of U.S. biggest myths too:

Most people seem oblivious to how authoritarian first world countries like the U.S. are.

Well that's not very local at all!
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:50:13
I don't think so. A pixel map, and 4 directions, multiplied by multiple cursor speeds to input would be astronomically more diverse than 2 keyboard keys.
They would suck if they got you to just press 2 keys on the keyboard such as left and right.
@_date: 2019-03-09 00:00:26
Perfect example.
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:49:47
Mostly, yes.

It's because you guys live in a 'free' country.

Again, what 'hard cap' are you talking about? Are you meaning when you close a channel? Why would you close a channel?

Like private property, or CEOs being able to dictate how they choose to run their own company?
@_date: 2019-02-20 13:10:54


One of the goals of bitcoin is that noone else should be able to tell how much money you have.

Cryptography will 'find a way' too. I would say 'good luck with that' to governments.

I don't like that logo's implication that BIT**COIN** is still 2 words.
Pretty awesome that it's up there though.

So? Why shouldn't they?
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:19:32

In fact he's probably one of the LN coders, Alex Bosworth.

Unless you use a second layer technology, perhaps something along the lines of...
...the lightning network.

In case it's not obvious to anyone else, QR generators are just QR generators, there's no need for a "bitcoin specific" one. They just convert any text into a QR image. You can paste in any text, such as a bitcoin address.

Good, then we'd end up having more private services available.

You can do that voluntarily at any time, even if noone can force taxes on you.

It's been there for quite a while.

Agreed; it's not possible to tell from a reddit account who's been around since 2009 and who hasn't.

Just saying this doesn't make it true.

Like obligating others to contribute just because you want them too, for example.
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:11:33
So when you set up your own lightning node, you can't set your routing fee to 0 in your config?
@_date: 2019-02-28 05:25:13
Hodling is a perfectly valid form of 'using it'.
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:52:21
Very interesting, thanks.
(And surprising you can't make a node 100% free)
Does that differ by implementation? i.e. could someone program a daemon capable of being free and be compatible with LN?
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:14:12
*in a non-custodial fashion.
@_date: 2019-02-20 13:20:40
I think if that entire scenario played out, they wouldn't be called taxes. They'd be called subscriptions/membership fees, donations, etc.
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:16:49
This is awesome. To whoever made this: The line extending downward from 1991 was confusing... maybe an error?

That's so fascinating. I'm going to call my parents.

Why would you pay taxes on your gains, if nobody but you can see your gains?
If your starting amount is private, and your ending amount is private, then what gain are you planning to pay tax on?
Purchases/sales will become a lot easier to anonymise too.
@_date: 2019-02-21 10:23:59
Spanish learner here... still kind of novice level but here's my attempt at translating the first part...
Start to accept digital payments with
It's secure.
Your bitcoins are yours only. The bitcoins can't be congelados* or confiscated.
It's simple.
As easy as downloading an app. Bitcoin is simple to learn to use.
It's fast.
Payments with Bitcoin confirm in minutes, not days. Get the money instantly.
It's free.
Unlike credit cards, there are no commissions for accepting Bitcoin. It works like digital cash.
*que es eso?!
Edit: Anyone mind translating the rest? There are some bigger words in that section, and I'm not quite able to read it.
@_date: 2019-02-06 07:10:41
I can't see how any of that relates to people being able to freely transact sub-satoshi amounts over the LN (which they can, by the way).
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:44:42


Pro tip: the $ symbol already implies *dollars*
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:24:13
Rip-off Australian internet that not only has a data cap, but charges for uploads too.
@_date: 2019-02-15 02:53:54
Technically true, however decentralized blockchains are also essentially just databases.
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:53:30
How about YOU say goodbye to Bitcoin and the rest of us stick around and use it as the world's best settlement network that can back LN everyday transactions?
@_date: 2019-02-06 06:43:26
What 'hard cap'? Sub-satoshi payments work just fine on LN.
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:32:07


Again, 'good luck with that' in the long run.
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:58:44
It's almost as if 'economists' have no idea what they're talking about.
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:42:02
What for? What problem would that solve?
Keeping in mind the entire planet could run fine on just 1 BTC total.
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:57:10
There's another reason too: Every increase in Bitcoin's price strengthens LN's comparative usefulness as a *microtransactions* alternative.
e.g. If 1 BTC were $1m, then having a 2nd layer handling satoshi-level amounts becomes much more important (and hence valuable).
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:05:27

Good robot.
Tip for next time: we call ourselves 'people'.
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:07:27
Quite often. It started out as just something I'd think about with luxuries, but more and more I think about it with everyday items like milk and bread too.
Of course, I still buy the milk and bread.

@_date: 2019-01-24 12:15:54


The base is arbitrary, too.
A 'whole coin' would have a different meaning in base 9 or base 11.
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:00:59
Well, to all the scammers and thieves out there I say: Good luck.
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:18:52
Reminds me of when everything in Bitcoin was *two weeks*. I think it stemmed from something Karpeles said once regarding Gox withdrawals, and then people picked it up as being similar to a Total Recall scene, and ran with it from there.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:04:07
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:56:28
I own bitcoin and don't subscribe to the scam/theft paranoia.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:42:37
Good article. My only objection is where the author lists *evading sanctions* like it's a bad thing:


In my book, evading sanctions is just "routing around the damage" created by the artificial restriction of market trade. Ultimately it's the same thing as *avoiding payment censorship*, which most people would cite as one of Bitcoin's positives... indeed even alluded to in that author's very same sentence above.
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:16:24
That would be fascinating if hundreds of individual paths were involved.
Is AMP coded and working as planned?
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:05:41
Some people like to use Bitcoin anonymously. These small transactions are a way for someone to try to determine your real-life identity, by correlating this small amount with other amounts you may be spending.
@_date: 2019-01-24 04:29:24


Such as these *two* words:

It's actually a joke that fell flat because you still haven't noticed yet that you made a typo.
