This is torture.  I wish I never started this thread
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:54:47
I'm sorry I even posted anything to be honest.  Wont happen again
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:07:48
Because I made over 10x my money. Its never a bad thing to take profits.  Nobody can call a top
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:10:30
Long story short I bought early.  Saw signs 9f a bubble so I sold now I'm back in.  "I WANT PROOF!"
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:34:35
I sold between 3k and 7k on the way up. I sold because it went up really fast and the average Joe started talking about it.  I sold bitcoin cash over 3k each too. I haven't been back until now

Savein is right.  Best bet is buy a set amount every week . You'll never buy at the bottom and you dont want to buy at a short term top so just dollar cost average

You dont believe what? Who are you that I need to prove it to you. How about this. Ill bet you actual $$ to prove its real. Otherwise why would I care If you believe me

You're 100% right.  I'm 44 years old.  I just wanted to write a short post explaining my thoughts.  You better believe this will be my last post ever.  I cant deal with these teenagers who dominate this reddit thread .

I am so sorry I ever started this thread to be honest. Itll never happen again
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:05:31
Ok. How do I post pics from my phone here ?
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:42:27
nah. Ill pass on that one
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:52:33
So I sold it to pay off my mortgage.  Saved several thousand on interest.  Also time is money.  I used the money to make more money , also I bought back less coins and a much smaller investment.  Also I needed to see where the coin was headed before I bought back . All those factors my man
  Good luck

Ok. I'll show proof. I'll take a screen shot when I get home. When I send proof I want a big laud in my return . I bought bitcoin in the $300 $400 range and sold on the way up before the crash.  I didnt sell at the top as nobody can call a top but I sold before the crash.

Making 10x profit is never terrible timing.  People who bought at 19 thousand had terrible timing
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:57:05
I dont know why we even bother to post anything
@_date: 2019-04-13 14:47:54
No. Im sorry I ever even started this thread . Never again
@_date: 2019-04-12 15:57:16
Time is money.  I sold more shares than I bought back and it doesnt matter where it's been it matter where it's going. All economics 101 friend
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:28:13
I think I agree. I got in in the 200s and sold between 5k and 10k . Missed the whole run up to 20k but sold because everyone started talking about it. I dont hear anything now so I may buy some.
