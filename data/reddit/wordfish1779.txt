That's a good question. I guess it depends on how their cold&amp;hot wallets are secured. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:08:32
Lol, that's a FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:15:58
I don't think you understand all the possibilities of the device. You should never trust your browser, but you can fully trust your device not to leak your private keys even during the signing a transaction. As mentioned before, you should always check receiving addresses on TREZOR display; same goes for the outgoing transactions. 
Also, you should double check all the addresses via the second channel. 
Feel free to shoot more questions my way, if needed.

Hey there, TREZOR PR/MKT here. Sorry about the packaging, this doesn't happen often, but it seems to me like a manufacturing error. There was supposed to be quite strong industrial grade glue, but for some reason, there's not. I'm quite confident that your device was not tampered with, but it's still shitty user-experience. Hit me with a DM if you're interested in more details.

TREZOR comes with a neat web-wallet which can be used on a daily basis, I'd recommend using that regularly, it communicates with your device where all the private keys are stored securely. 
Your recovery seed works as backup, so even if your device is destroyed somehow or stoled, you can always use this mnemonic to access your funds by recovering into another TREZOR device or a compatible third-party wallet. Just keep them separated to mitigate the risk. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:11:14
Go ahead :) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:01:54
Point taken, that's true. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:31:41
Once again, sorry about that! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:06:12
Not really. There are too many variables and pitfalls, and you would still need internet access for broadcasting the TX.
Private keys in hardware wallet are isolated in the device which is designed for this purpose. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:24:12
I believe I've already addressed this as few others. Sure your browser can be compromised with a MITM attack but your device cannot. Double checking is the trick. Back and forth. 


@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:50
The original thread was about non-vulnerability of TREZOR. I admit that your statement is true, but it's not related to TREZOR security, definitely not about the original Meltdown/Spectre topic.
To avoid mentioned risk, you should always double check using different methods of communication, if possible ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:29:50
TREZOR operates with zero-trust principle. Sure that your computer can be swarmed with malware, but your coins would be still safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:47:24
AFAIK today's suspicious fork has nothing to do with an original 2X fork which eventually never occurred. Please do your research first :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:07:41
Yes, you can separate the funds at the account level, or you can both use a different passphrase under one seed/device. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:48:07
Feel free to do some research online (e.g., cryptosteel.com) and PM me if interested :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:52:33
Dunno, it's fully open-sourced and unlike ledger's TREZOR support is a top notch :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:11:18
Those two are the only ones with ongoing dev support. Some of the wallets on the list are just TREZOR clones and some others just closed their business. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:45:15
It's just preorder from preorder.trezor.io. Unfortunately sold out at the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:44:10
Yeah WebUSB 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:22:11
What a story! I work in SatoshiLabs aka the people who make TREZOR. If you're interested, we'd like to send you a free cryptosteel. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:45:00
Same applies to TREZOR as well. You cannot spend from a specific address in wallet.trezor.io, but Electrum works.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:52:22
Most of the exchanges do not support segwit at all; ergo you'll probably get an error if you're going to use a segwit address for withdrawal. But you can always withdraw to your legacy address in TREZOR and move it to Segwit afterwards.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:07:19
TREZOR is in stock at the moment FYI. And sure it can be considered expensive but it's basically about your priorities and amount of coins you have. One way or another, HW wallet is must have nowadays.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:30:49
Get a hardware wallet and obey the security recommendations, don't store your seed online. Simple as that. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:26:14
Sorry for that but it wouldn't be too wise to publish such guide before the split. We'll release additional and very detailed info when the fork is imminent. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:52:03
You're very welcome. We're so glad that we can finally clear up the situation and remove any possible bias flying around the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:33:43
You'd still have a backup in the form of your recovery seed which is BIP39 compatible which means it's compatible with all the major HD wallets. The recovery mnemonic is fundamentally a different representation of your private keys, and if you own the private keys, you own your coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:37:31
In case you would like to find why and there was a pretty good reason, check this article: 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:35:00
Well, no need for that anymore :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:21:56
Thank you for your continuous support!
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:23:13
BTG did. 2X did not.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:03:23
If you'd like to know more, here's a post about Segwit accounts on TREZOR blog: 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:23:22
100% Agreed.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:39:57
All good :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:32:15
This might be too soon, but good job anyway :) 
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:37:07
No, it's working with any initialized TREZOR device. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:08:01
Final pricing is not decided yet, but I assume that it will be somewhere within preorder pricing range :) 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:03:23

Not at all, it's regular security newsletter.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:13:35
Caps Lock much?
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:32:10
That's a bold statement; I'm not sure if that created a precedent for all future forks. Nevertheless, BCH fork was less complicated than 2x for example.
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:19:34
Really nothing to be done unless you provide further details. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:02:37
Hmmm. I guess if you want to be 100% sure you should move your coins to legacy acc's either way. The thing is, you should be at least a little bit familiar with the concept before it actually happens, right? 
I'm not exactly familiar with the Segwit2x whitepaper, but it should support segwit accounts. If you don't want to risk anything just go with the legacy, I mean how expensive and complicated it can be?
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:22:23
Trick question. My personal opinion would be - if the potential fork would support segwit you can leave your coins at SegWit accounts if not you would have to move them back to your legacy accounts before the chain split. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:43:46
Great device!
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:15:24
You don't have to move coins back and forth, you just need access to the private keys, in this case, recover your mnemonic into the TREZOR.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:02:13
I just skimmed it, but at least pricing is pure speculation. The pre-order for Trezor T was started at $119 and went up from there. Current retails price isn't known at the moment, and I believe it's worth mentioning. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:29:52
Thanks Steve, appreciate that!
