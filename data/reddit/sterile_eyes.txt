Please help me find the proper community

Schoor, SLP tokens, etc. There is new version in November. If you want to read the news, go for the release notes

I don't think every company that innovates on top of this tech is going to be there, though
@_date: 2019-10-29 12:11:22
Thank you for the response and effort. I'll make sure to watch it
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:35:03
Thank you!

Yes, I'm aware of lightning, it's pros and cons (and also accidents). It's been almost 3 years since I've heard about it :/
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:15:59
It sure is a scam, but also, bitcoin doesn't scale... You can't ask any large group to use it
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:26:51
This community lacks these kind of discussions sooo much.
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:31:53
Cool, thank you. I experienced lightning a few months ago and it was awful. I'll look into it again
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:42:43
You could also enable a discussion and exposition of future upgrades, new tech, new projects that are not in the main repo, etc.
Were this a discussion about price, how would you react?
Moon, lambo whatever

It couldn't. Last week a guy lost 4 btc on LN, so, no
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:19:47
What is the current tx/s capacity? Has it increased since the 2017 full block situation?
@_date: 2019-12-29 03:05:03
Thank you

Just coming here to remember you that a lot of the argument for keeping the blocks small (that motivated the 2017 fork) is based in the shitty idea you should be able to use an old modem, computer and bad internet to contribute with the network.
"decentralization" is far from the current state
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:22:40
Both share a lot of history in the form of a blockchain that both can read. Both have the same genesis block, of course
One has the older ticker (btc) and brand. 
If things were a little different when the fork happened , we could have same technology difference between them and the inverted situation with the ticker. Nobody who isn't into crypto would notice. 
The one that inherited the ticker also inherited the branding. Normal people don't care about the block size, but miners will pay attention to how much this or that coin is recognized, hence the value of the brand. 
One has a site (bitcoin.com) and a subreddit (r/btc), the other has another another subreddit (r/Bitcoin) and, as far as I'm aware, also the Twitter handle (
One has larger fees , an open tech problem. The other has lower fees due to available block space, but less use (less speculation, let's be honest here. None is in a position to claim widespread adoption)
Both are forks, none is the original source from Satoshi. 
I vouch we look at how their technologies, stack, community and adoption works out, with big blocks or lightning. Let merit, demand and the market decide.
What is truly toxic is this endless back and forth
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:38:15
Have you used lightning? How was your experience? Mine was awful and there aren't many advances being made there.
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:44:33
So you just forgot how they were when the block was full?
Confirmation bias at its best
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:57:10
I'm not rooting. This is not a basketball match. I look at projects, features, costs, advantages, etc
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:39:36
Very little improved. The network is basically the same. Segwit will do for a time, but another rally like  2017 will just cause another crazy fee increase.
Confirmation bias: when you only see what agrees with you and dismisses what does not.
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:39:37
The numbers independ of other coins
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:13:28
To summarize, connecting to a node was impossible. I just wanted to make a simple test and it wouldn't work, unfortunately
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:44:19
Well, man, you can look at historical and current fees for all networks by yourself.
