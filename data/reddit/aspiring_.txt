Thanks Torsten,
Your support is much appreciated!
Catch up for coffee soon!

Because I'm an idiot :)
Oh well, expensive lesson learnt!

Hi there,
Got this link shared with me, and I think we can help. I'm Sam Lee ( from Bitcoins Reserve ( cofounded last year to help make Bitcoin more accessible for investors.
Bitcoins reserve does large volume procurement for customers twice a week from major exchanges that have cheaper coins 
Hopefully with our volume, we can get you a better exchange rate than most.
On another note, we also are operate the worlds first Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Fund (

Hi Recz,
Sam Lee here, I agree the title is probably a bit misleading, we never blamed USMS for the loss of our coins, we recognised that that the fault lies with our internal procedures not covering social engineering edge cases on this level of sophistication, and therefore take it as an expensive lesson learnt that we pay for out of our own pockets.
Also the attack was far more sophisticated than taking me offpage and asking for my credentials again. It involved a "request access" button issued by google that exploits a javascript vunerability in the chrome browser which gave the hacker all my passwords saved into the chrome browser in plain text.

Hi Steven,
Thanks for your support, I'm lucky to recognise that Bitcoin businesses that don't remain transparent often will run into bigger difficulties down the track.
As I've kept in contact with others that are part of the SR Bidders list, we later realised that we're not the only ones that was targetted in this manner.
Damage is done, I just hope we can all help each other become more aware and vigilant of the dangers around handling Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:56:03
No worries, here's what it looks like...
Please share this out in the hopes of stopping others from falling into this as well.
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:25:14
Just an FYI, they sent it out twice and recalled it twice...
As if they didn't learn the first time they did it.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:05:37
Maybe it's kept so safe... that they can no longer access them!

Hi Bitcoin Charlie,
Yes, it's a very old email that I was using to register for the USMS auction, which I never got around to setting 2FA on. I had 2FA on anything bitcoin related, but the chain is only as strong as the weakest link.
As this email was the email address for password recovery purposes to the domain registrar that manages the bitcoinsreserve.com domain.
I agree, if 2FA was turned on, the hacker probably would have ran into a brick wall and moved on to easier targets, and even if they hung around, they would find progress to be far slower.

Thanks Onetallnerd,
Sam Lee here, Just to further specify, the hacker used social engineering via email and sms to carry out the attack that finally transferred the coins after gaining access to the companies admin email account.
As no private key's or access to wallets were stored on emails.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:13:26
37 emails including mine.
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:31:58
Prepare for a torrent of betting, just like the trading going on when Mt Gox "disabled" their bitcoin withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:54:18
Yes, share the screenshot would definitely help!
I've just screencapped mine. This was the last communication, as after this, they had sufficient access to work backwards from there.
Would be good to compare notes!
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:13:22


You're right, we just wish to share our story to save others from potentially falling for the same attack. Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:32:27
Proof! they did it twice ;)

Thanks LeeWallis,
Here's it is in the paper today.
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:17:32
I think this reinforces the fact that bitcoiners have more "disposable income", which reminds me of the infographic we put out at the start of this year.
Average order value for Bitcoin payment - AUD $831.71
Average order value for Credit card payment - AUD $686.74
Bitcoiners are spending 21.1% more than CC customers.

Hi Imises,
Just quoting myself, “Is it the US Marshals’ fault that the attack occurred? Absolutely! Is it their fault that we lost some Bitcoins? No,”
So the attack could only occur because the bidders list was leaked by the USMS.
But those who lost bitcoins to the attacker (like us) can blame no one but themselves.
Sorry if the article title is a bit misleading, let me know if that clarifies things for you.
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:35:11
Not on the original email that got hacked, as it was a very old email account that I don't really use anymore. True, that 2FA could have saved us, or at least buy us enough time to realise that we've been compromised.

Indeed. A vulnerability in Chrome browser, and unfortunately we trusted google a tad too much!
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:20:56
Yeah, seeing the same thing as well, how often does this happen?
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:46:41
Thanks! Day 2 of our road show. Lots of interest combined with people giving us weird looks.

Hi Rhader,
Thanks for your query. I appreciate you reaching out to find out more about what we do.
We're the worlds first and leading Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Fund, and perform automated trading between all major exchanges across currency pairs such as USD, CNY, EUR via BTC.
I've had my first coins since December 2012, and have gotten more involved since mid 2013 by integrating bitcoin payments into our company.
You can find me here.
As for the current status of the fund, we're at this moment oversubscribed, as exceeding our projected AUM can potentially negatively impact our profitability. Profitability for June was just over 1%, not bad considering in that same month, bitcoin dropped by 9% its value.
We provide all customers with full internally audited reports and perform external audits via our Accounting Firm every 3 months.

Thanks Hal,
Agreed, rookie errors all round that didn't factor in their social engineering tactics, which led us to sending the Bitcoins to the hackers.
I'm sure we could have just as easily not mention any of this, but fact is, I'd rather be 100% honest and transparent with the public, regardless of whether the news is good or bad, instead of being selective on what to communicate, and bowing out like after long periods of next to no communication like other high profiled bankruptcies.
Anyways, hopefully you will find my explanation that "I'm not perfect and we all make mistakes" acceptable.
But if not, you are entitled to your opinion and respect your decision, as you have every right to stay away.
Best regards,

No, we didn't have our registrar on 2FA, you're right, there's quite a few things that we could have done that would make things harder. Oh well, that's life.
Here's a screenshot of the "request access" button that jacked all the passwords out of my chrome browser for your reference.

Hi and thanks for all the support guys. This attack happened last Thursday, so already had a good few days to recover, kids and pets really do the trick you know :)
Not to draw any parallels, but I now understand a little bit more why MagicalTux loves that cat so darn much!
Have already accepted the loss, and looking forward to learning from this. (but just incase proof is required, here it is 
I'll be speaking at the Melbourne Bitcoin Meetup tonight regarding the attack in the hopes of helping our local community navigate through deep waters.
After which, I'll be share the ppt on our website to serve as a reminder to ourselves and others.

Thanks Kometes,
I've passed this onto our CTO for him to look into it further, I think he did mention something about signing emails moving forward.
Cheers,
