Let's assume someone smuggled several hundred thousand bitcoins out of mt. gox. It could be a hacker or the owner himself. Is it possible to track the movements? I heard a part of the missing ones were found somehow. Is it possible for the thief to convert such an amount into fiat without causing a stir? Bitstamp e.g. has the verification process that at least connects someone to a bank account. But there probably are ways to get rid of those bitcoins, right? I am kind of worried that we get flood by the stolen coins at some point. Maybe we are already.

tl;dr: the price can go up, down or stay.

Gambling has also the opportunity to earn you money. In the end i still would recommend to most people not to gamble. (Despite the fact that there are people who earn money. Maybe especially because of that.)

Not sure where you got that info from. 2x isn't adding 1MB

There are a lot of influential people (especially miners) who have a strong interest in killing the new UASF chain. They have lots of hash power and money. My question is: Is there any way that those people can sabotage this?   
(Also consider immoral or illegal actions)

source that they are owned by US?

There is really no content in this.
Great build up that China's Miners are all missunderstood and then they never care to clarify about what.

I am not an expert on this (like you are). Correct me if I am wrong and you disagree.
Doesn't segwit also help with channel monitoring?   
And does a signature malleability fix not make things easier for further upgrades?   
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:31:34
Yes, but segwit also makes it easier to implement other improvements like side chains and lightning network. If people move transactions off chain miners don't get fees from those.
