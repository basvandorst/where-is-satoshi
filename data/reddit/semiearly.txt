I remember first hearing about bitcoins from this slashdot post in 2010 (  I was interested enough to download the client and try to mine some coins.  After running the client for a few minutes and being unable to tell if anything was actually happening I uninstalled it.  To think if they just had some kind of estimate to next block mined or some indicator it was doing work I probably would have let it mine for awhile.
At the time bitcoin was worth about $.06 but I kinda disregarded it as a cool idea but didn't fully see the potential in it.  Later when bitcoin reached dollar parity I began to take notice again.  I don't remember the exact timeline but I bought some coins in the first bubble for around $5.  I also started GPU mining around that time.
The highest coin count I ever got to was 500 BTC.  I remember debating if I should have bought 500 more to get a nice even 1000 BTC but for whatever reason I decided I had already invested enough in it.  I also had converted some of that bitcoin into litecoin and had 10,000 LTC that I later sold when LTC started going up.
After the first crash down to $2 / BTC I remember thinking, well that was fun and figured I would just hold on to the coins I bought and if they became worth nothing it would have been a life lesson.  Once they started going back up above $10 I sold enough to set me even so anything after that would be pure profit.
I held most of my coins through the 2nd bubble above $200.  When that crashed back down I was smart enough to realize this was history repeating itself and the price would rebound again.  At the time I had more in cryptocurrencies than I did in any other investment, including 401k, etc, which was an odd feeling but I had faith it would bounce back.
When the third bubble came in 2013 I decided if the price got high enough I would sell about half of my coins to pay off my mortgage.  This seems like a big enough life changing event that even if the price continued to rise I would be happy because I kept half my coins and if the price dropped I would also be happy I sold so many and now had no mortgage.
Luckily the price that would make me debt free was $1220 per coin.  I watched with anticipation as the price continued to go upward.  Once it got above 1200 and started to stall out I said close enough and sold enough to pay off my mortgage.  Out of pure luck that ended up being the peak of the last bubble and I'd like to say I knew it was going to pop there but really I had just calculated how high I would need for the price to be to pay off my mortgage and capital gains taxes and that was the magic number.
I still hold a decent amount of coins, enough that even when the price goes back above $1200 I'll be happy because I still have a large investment in BTC.  I probably wouldn't sell the remainder until it would be another life changing event like being able to retire completely.

Selected automatically from what wallet? I used breadwallet to send a 225 bytes transaction and it recommended a $0.03 transaction fee. It's been waiting hours. This is why I made this post. If this was the first time I used Bitcoin I'd think it was broken and move on.

You should post the transaction id, no one can offer and explanation without that.
Either way your coins are not lost they are most likely just stuck due to a low fee and the current load on the network. At some point in the next few days they will either make it to coinbase or they will come back to your wallet.

I know how the system works, I used to do arbitrage across exchanges so I moved coins all day.
There were plenty of blocks that came and went during that two hour window. While you are correct it's not uncommon to wait an hour for a new block, it sucks that now you have to wait two hours if you use breadwallet or any wallet that doesn't let you adjust fees.
All this has and will scare away new users. Core devs are not acknowledging that or don't care.

Sure it's this one:

As a new user would 2 hours to send coins over the internet seem that great? My point was that when I first used it I was amazed that sending coins could be so fast and painless. Now you need to do data analysis to see when your transaction will make it through.
FWIW last time I sent from that wallet it took 7 minutes, waiting 2 hours as the "new normal" feels ridiculous.

I agree the work for things like lightning and sidechains are the long term fix, but what about the next year? I think that's where a lot of the current frustration is coming from, the timeline just doesn't seem to fit with the reality of the current network load.

I sold 150 BTC right at the ETF decision because it just looked like bad news ahead with the scaling debate.  That's about as close to the run up as you can get.  Honestly I don't regret it because at the time it seemed like the right call.

Downloaded the Bitcoin client back when it was first mentioned on slashdot.  Got impatient and couldn't tell it was doing anything so deleted it.  If I had seen it find coins I'm fairly confident I would have left it mining but oh well.
Worked out fine though.  I ended up buying 500 BTC back when they were $5 a piece (debated on getting 1000 but decided I didn't want to put that much in).  Multiple trades down the road I ended up cashing out half my stash above the $1000 price point and paying off my mortgage.
