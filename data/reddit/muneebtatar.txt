Why are you getting defensive? I was pointing out a fact. I am speaking for myself too since I’m a human too. I have imperfections too. I am not better than anyone. 
Unfortunately the wrong ones end up running governments - mostly.
There are also good people among us, that is what keeps us moving forward and gives us hope.
That is my observation.

This brought up an issue we didn't think about. How do you think we should proof that we are legit? 
We charge a small fee for each person that raises the BTC. The more the people raise, the more we earn. The more millionaires and billionaires are created, the more income we generate. Our business model is build on the fact that people will keep coming. Trust is essential to that. What steps do you suggest we have take to earn trust and proof we are not a scam?
Though Scamitty is a catchy name.

I don't want to use some fake certificates or medal of trustworthy, whatever that thing is and why would i copy a roulette for CS:GO skins?
i am trying to build a business here and if you can't give me constructive feedback about what gives you the idea that this is a scam then you shouldn't have replied at all.

How does our idea make you compare it to BitConnect? BitConnect was a ponzi scheme. 
Our idea can be summarised as "a contest for which the prize consists of the amounts contributed by the various competitors." Each user raises 0.0002 BTC (1.88 USD); 0.0001 goes toward the total bitcoin amount pooled and the other 0.0001 BTC is the service fee.
Your comment was helpful in illuminating the trust issues we have to face. What steps do you suggest we take to earn trust of users such as yourself?

What makes you think that this is a scam?

Does Coinbase support all wallets?

I am looking for an online approach. Making bitcoin payments through a website. Probably using an API through Nodejs or PHP. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:12:57
Are there any websites that you can give us as examples which stay true to the main principles of Bitcoin in processing payments and in your view is the correct way to approach this matter?

Thank you! You provided me with the type of feedback i wanted; brutal honesty with facts.
It's true that we haven't thought of much of the important fundamental issues since this project just started about 2-3 hours ago. We decided to start with a name and UI and then go onwards from there. We made a decision to be in touch with the Reddit Bitcoin community so we can have insight from a diverse group of people.
We came across issues such as anonymity in our team discussion and have put it down on list to be looked into on Monday. We may get rid of anonymity to some degree since it interferes with fairness.
What do you think your solution would be to the problems you discovered?

On second thought, I might implement it on my own without any merchant services in middle. Btw thanks for the answer.

I just googled an article on Coinbase blog from May 2014 announcing their support for the Bitcoin payment protocol.
Please do correct me if I am wrong.

Lol, No. It's not nonprofit. Each user raises 0.0002 BTC (1.88 USD); 0.0001 goes towards the total bitcoin amount pooled and the other 0.0001 BTC is the service fee. Though this amount may change a little since we haven't completely decided on it yet.

I came to the conclusion that a lottery can never be fair or verified to be fair if it is controlled by a single organization. We decided to build a decentralized web server application for selecting the lottery winner to ensure game fairness. This way we don’t control it but the public does. There are many other hurdles to cross before we can get this thing done completely.
Thank you for your help, TheGreatMuffin.

There is a documentary on Netflix called 'Requiem For The American Dream' that features Noam Chomsky, he also makes the same point about the end of the manufacturing industry.

Well, I think that isn’t the answer. 
The problem with governments and banks are people and money. These institutions are controlled by people and people are controlled by money. The solution right now seems to be Bitcoin, it may not be the perfect solution but it seems to be the best one we have right now.
Anyways, that is my opinion. Only time will tell where we go from here. Let’s hope for the best.

I agree. Monetary policy isn't the only factor which is leading us to the slow and gradual collapse of the American Dream. Globalization, outsourcing, stagnating wages and jobs automation are elements that can't be withdrawn from the discussion due to the influence they've had. 
Yes, Bitcoin can be of help in the monetary policy situation but i don't know what could help in slowing down the repercussions of the other factors involved. Though with the advent of automation, robotics and AI, it is to be expected that availability of more jobs is going to decline. Innovation always has natural consequences and it seems this time it is jobs. Maybe starting programs to retrain people affected in new skills could help? It could, but it's going to take time.
