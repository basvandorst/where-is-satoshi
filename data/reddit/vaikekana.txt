Which Bitcoin companies have had their LHV accounts closed?

Yeah I had terrible experience with them too. Fortunately bitpay helped mediate a refund

*fund my cuber wallet...
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:08:27
I wrote to support but no response yet. How do I connect my LHV account to the app? Or do I find my wallet (in euros) through some other method?
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:56:59
When you use the app, you have to connect it to your LHV bank account through your iban. Bank does all necessary kyc to open your bank account. Once you have connected the app to your account you can then buy/sell send/receive euros with others who have the app. It simply then debits your account and credits the receivers. All euros stay inside LHV.  At least that's my understanding:) there is a cafe across the road from LHV which have a merchant app to accept purchases. Looking forward to trying it out!
@_date: 2015-12-06 23:33:12
Have you got the list handy? Which was the most user friendly?
@_date: 2015-12-06 23:45:27
Interesting. Which one was the most graphically  appealing?
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:57:55
But how do I get money into the app? Ideally it's totally connected to my LHV account so I can use money directly from my account for everyday purchases via this wallet, removing the need to use a card or withdraw euros from a bank machine

Apparently sushi cat accepts bitcoins. Talked with owner of pudel baar in telliskivi, recommending he use bips.me and organise a meet up, but nothing materialized.  Have talked with CEO of bigbank and he was generally interested, sent him some good articles, but he still holds a negative to impartial view. Even suggested to postimess boss to use bitwall for access to articles, but his main concern was how to cash out btc earnt to euros in a way that wasn't difficult for his accountants. 
We've given all our employees bitcoins last Christmas (to play with, understand, secure, spend, save) which has been good, but unfortunately there still isn't enough places to spend them.
We work in the online gambling industry, and are seeing a huge and rapid development in this market, simply due to the irreversible nature (so finally no fraud or chargebacks!)
Have considered setting up a btc atm at the airport but that's more of a long term project, but I believe it's a perfect place to put one :)
Would also love to setup a proper exchange here, or at least a brokerage (regulated and following all aml/KYC procedures) but all the banks are shitscared of dealing with btc related businesses.
Really strange that government isn't behind it in a stronger way, given the promotion of an IT society, x-road, wifi everywhere, 90% of population only using internet banking and mass adoption of digital ID cards, utilized for health records, digital signatures, identify verification, voting...
If only neobee would come here, I really believe there could be mass and rapid adoption.
If there are any good nodejs developers here wanting to work on bitcoin related projects in Tallinn, feel free to drop me a msg.
Very interested to join / sponsor any btc meet ups here too:)

LHV bank is very pro-bitcoin (coinbase do their euro sepa transactions there).  from a friend of mine who recently opened up an account there, the conversation with bank teller went something like this:
him:  opened a bank account for my (estonian) company... the teller asked what does my company do... I told her we are going to trade bitcoins. she just smiled and said OK and opened the account for me.
me: that easy?
him: yes, I asked her that is it supposed to be that easy because all the other banks are blocking it. she said with LHV it is that easy.
hopefully the Estonian financial authorities will come to their senses very soon, remove the VAT on btc transactions and then i believe can become a hot bed for bitcoin startups and innovations (especially if the e-resident program comes to fruition)

As the treasurer of the Estonian Cricket Association, we would accept with open arms sponsorship from to help promote Bitcoin!  Admittedly we do not have the exposure of CSK or RCB in the IPL, however we are ranked  in the world and participate in the ICC Europe regional qualifiers for the World Cup.  
In 2012, we hosted one of the ICC Europe Division 3 event and thanks to the generous sponsorship from 888poker, we were lucky enough to have Shane Warne and Liz Hurley attend (which was just huge media wise) for our cricket team in Estonia. 
We are currently raising funds to build a new cricket ground/s as the current place where we play (the middle of the local hipodroom / horsetrack) as been sold off to developers to put up more residential buildings in 2015/6, taking away the inner city green grass lands where we play.  As a side note, one of the main focuses of the growth of cricket globally is a huge focus on the development of cricket (in junior) levels and the growth of domestic leagues.  We taught over 1000 kids in our schools programs in 2013 alone and those Qwik Cricket sets are quite expensive! 
If you guys want to sponsor our Cricket Association, we would love to promote bitcoin on a domestic and international level, by both our national men's and women's teams on their International tours this year.  To note, we are an official member of the ICC and as part of this we have to submit audited annual reports to ICC head office, so there would certainly be fiscal responsibly on what funds are collected and exactly how they are spent.  
Interestingly, there are over 2 million active cricketers in mainland Europe, and i would dare say a majority of them are originally from the sub continent; whilst they live and work in Europe, i am sure a number of them still regularly remit funds back home to their native countries.

hi hanumanthehumane
very sorry on the late reply, i wanted to have a board meeting before taking this further.  as mentioned in my post our current ground (where we have 2 pitches - in the middle of a racecourse!) has been sold and is being redeveloped into residential apartments in 2016.  the hipodroom is relocating 20 mins out of town and they have reserved us space to build 4 grounds and a proper club house etc.  however we also teach cricket to about 1000 kids per summer and need an inner city ground (with nets) to do this.  we have found the perfect location and are currently getting approval from the local government to build the ground.
however to answer your questions, we get about 15k usd from the ICC per year and from local sponsors, yearly subs, donations, merchandise sales, raise about 35k in total. this goes towards, buying new kit, buying balls (indoor and outdoor), paying coaches, running school sessions, mowing the grass :)  paying umpires &amp; scorers, ground rental, indoor cricket rental (we have snow for 6 months of the year) and putting money towards junior development programmes and improving our facilities.  the icc gave us a 3.5k development fund this year, to put towards building the new nets at the inner city ground (which is a perfect start), but ideally we would like to build the whole ground (level the grass, cement the pitch, buy matts, build the nets etc). we have estimated this will cost around 20k in total, so currently we are planning to do it over 3 years. we will have a full budget ready in about a month. 
so quite simply we would put all funds raised from bitcoin / reddit sponsorship towards building the new inner city ground / training facility, so we will have a place to continue to teach new young Estonians the game of cricket!
we'll have a promotional video ready in about 1-2 weeks, so i'll post it up here, so you can check it out!

game on!  we sponsor the Estonian Cricket Association and have just announced we are giving away 200 euros worth of bitcoins in 7 euro lots to the members (enough to buy some sushi from a local sushi place which accepts btc!)
borrowed some text from this thread and crafted a nice post...  hopefully we can do our part to spread the adoption!
hi all!
the main sponsor of the Saaremaa Kriketi Klub ( wants to bring Bitcoins to the ECA members and help with the adoption of such an amazing technology, especially in regard to seamless movement of money around the world without the necessity of a third party (ie a bank!)
to help people understand, they are giving about 200 euros worth of bitcoins to ECA members.
no this is not a scam  we just want to help with everyone’s understanding of bitcoin!
1) what is Bitcoin:  watch and learn 
quite simply:
Imagine an Excel file with a list of account balances. This account owns this much, that account owns that much, etc. To send money, the balances just get adjusted up and down. That's it.
Now imagine this Excel file is duplicated and synced across the world with a peer-to-peer system like BitTorrent, with a special signature that is impossible to fake. That's the essence of Bitcoin.
2) one of the biggest issues with adoption is that its a “techy” thing, so we want to make this easier.
steps to get your bitcoins 
firstly, currently 1 Bitcoin is worth ~$650 @  (just like 1 euro is currently worth 80 Indian Rupees)
we like to refer to it as mBTC (milli Bitcoins) which means 1000 mBTC = 474 euros (or $650)
3) get a Bitcoin wallet (just like a bank account)
we recommend:
- Sparecoins:  (super simple chrome extension) perfect to keep a small amount of money on.
- Blockchain:  (a web based bitcoin wallet)
- Greenaddress.it:  (ultra secure)
- Electrum:  (lightweight downloadable program, also ultra secure)
Mobile apps
Android: Mycelium:  (just perfect for android)
iPhone: Verso: 
4) make a wallet and get your “address”, its a 32 character address (in most bitcoins wallets and for making payments, you can scan QR codes which is obviously much easier)
an example address is:
5) post your address in the facebook thread below, and we’ll send you 7 euros worth (~15 mBTC)
6) receive your money and then go spend it! or send some to another friend.
if you want to spend it on some food, goto  and buy some sushi with bitcoins!!! they accept them 
 (flights &amp; hotels)
 (EU based electronics shop)
 (buy digitial music)
 (Persian hand made shoes from Iran!)
 (coffee beans from Indonesia)
 (codes for PSN, Nintendo, Steam and Gifts cards)
 (support a charity)
 (property &amp; boats!)
 (pizza in Belgium and Netherlands)
7) if you want to buy more bitcoins (or just sell them and get money in your bank), then goto an exchange: 
or find someone nearby on 
8) you can read more about bitcoin here:
**cliff notes**
- make a bitcoin wallet
- post your bitcoin address in this thread
- receive 15 mbtc (~7 euros)
- enjoy!
ps; welcome to a decentralised new world, where there is no need for a central authority to control how money is spent (or created)! bitcoin is just like skype for p2p phone calls, or bittorrent for p2p media sharing…
note: we will only be sending bitcoins to members of the ECA

it wasn't an exchange, rather a local hobbyist's website like a local bitcoins.  the issue is around whether necessary KYC took place, not whether the trading of bitcoins is legal / illegal.

Why would the 'house' put up a substantial bankroll to satisfy the winners, when there is no house edge in it for them? To this end, if you were looking at a p2p model like betfair, why would someone lay a bet when there was no perceived advantage?

In the mobile app, if you want to receive funds it's impossible to copy paste only the address. You can use inbuilt Apple copy function, but then when pasting, it includes the qr code and other stuff. All we need is an easy to select and copy address, which can pasted elsewhere to have funds sent to that address
