Yeah lol, didnt had any solution until now i have bought a coolerbox with insulation. Im only 15 years old and i didnt had any money in the beginning when i bought it.

For now i have thought a computer fan filter to screw it on the fan that sucks air in. Should hopefully work without slowing the fan by alot. Thanks for the satoshi!

Its summer... and i have my computer which can generate massive heat.

Anyways i have bought a coolerbox yesterday and its working fine. Shouldnt be flammable hahah.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:21:04
I bought it used around 375 dollars. And im pretty sure it isnt from China flood.

Why should it start a fire? Doesnt even get hot, gets only up to 68 celsius degree. The box itself isnt hot enough that i cant touch it.
