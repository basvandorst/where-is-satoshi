I tried the same. Duh up an old Mac Mini (2008) and cleaned it up. The chain wouldn’t sync. Expected over 3 weeks. Probably too old to computer the hashes quickly enough. 
I’m not buying a new computer to run a node until I I have enough to justify it.

All very good points. I think Andreas answered the question of the supply curve during the testimony in Canada. IIRC, he said there is nothing stopping a different token with a different supply curve, even a responsive supply curve. Beyond Ripple, do you know Tether? it is meant to be 1:1 to the USD at all times. 
By the way, I'm not so concerned about the nominal value of 1 BTC. I rather wonder about the price stability. You can pick any fraction that is equivalent to $1 and use that as the base unit. The question is the BTC/USD rate over time and when will it stabilize at some organic growth rate.
Thinking about this, the existence of bitcoin doesn't preclude having a responsive crypto money supply. I'm just wondering out loud, but assuming the need for a monetary expansion (a "real crisis"), the USD still exists to expand the supply. Lower interest rates, more credit and spending (hopefully). Why would bitcoin stop any of this, especially if prices are still quoted in USD? BTC isn't the best inflation hedge (as you argued), so I don't think there would be a rush to buy more (at least not more than the goldbugs). 
I wonder if we are falling into a trap of imagining only that either bitcoin or the Fed exist. 
I have to think more about this...maybe I'll write a little technical note...

Just as I posted this I saw another article on bitcoin that you might like. It describes bitcoin as the crypto reserve currency for the ecosystem, having analogous advantages to the USD. Just another thought.

So it’s just an exchange, but without the ability of moving coins? What’s the use of that at all?

*part 2*


But we need to remember what we're examining - users of the network. If I register a Coinbase account to speculate on bitcoin, am I really using the bitcoin network? Is bitcoin's value proposition becoming more valuable intrinsically? Or is the price just increasing, because of the money flowing into it?
Very good point, but I would argue that the crypto ecosystem is the network, and bigger than bitcoin. Again, this network will be the base layer (bitcoin) + all the uses it enables. Atomic swaps should really make this take off.  


It is not just transactions that are verified without the need for trust. It is the state of the blockchain. So the network is always veryfing the validity of my digital bearer asset. It is always checking that the safe is locked. It is the pitbull. 


Back to the issue of deflationary asset/currency. Just thinking out loud here as I have to brush up on my Austrian monetary theory. The incentives are to hold until the time value is sufficient to justify a spend. Inflationary currencies are no different. I don't want to spend my dollars just because inflation is eating away at 2%. I want to save, invest, and generally build wealth. But I still need to buy food. So I spend what I have to, and save what I can. I get that the paradox of thrift is a real macroeconomic concern, but higher returns on savings (negative inflation or postive interest rates) may only bring efficiencies to spending. I won't buy a roomba because I'd rather keep my savings. Sorry to the roomba company....So this is just a way to force savings. All we need is to capture this for investment.....see my point about new business models.


This is where bitcoin shines - it has tremendous disruptive potential. It allows counterparties to interact without trust or central authority, which removes the role for banks, money transfer agents, and other folks who would usually clip some part of a transaction. Open, distributed blockchains will revolutionize many industries and social institutions.
However, this doesn't go too far in helping bitcoin's value. An asset's value depends on the rights it bestows to the owner - just like above, where we could value a stock or bond by the rights to the cashflow it grants. But what does bitcoin grant the owner?
It's an on-ramp into a new ecosystem. You can use it, sell it, or lend it. It's a claim in a new internet. Want to get on board and use crypto-contracts to transacts with robots? Sure, I'll give up my ticket to you in exchange for $1 MILLION DOLLARS!!! /pinkyfinger


This is why the really smart folks like Andreas Antonopolous comment far more on what the technology can do than what the token is worth. It's why he's testified to the Canadian Senate that we will see many different 'monetary recipes' across different cryptos, and the future is wide open for any mix of them to dominate. It's why he talks about the bitcoin protocol as a base layer, which may be abstracted from any future end-use and doesn't speculate on the price.
And this is the answer to all your questions. If Andreas vision is right, as I am increasingly, but not fully convinced it is, than the rest doesn't matter. All the discussion on the value of bitcoin in financial markets, or as a medium of exchange in the traditional dollar-denominated economy falls away. The value of bitcoin is as the base layer of an entire new network of exchanging value.

First, let me say that I've been lurking in r/bitcoin looking for exactly this type of discussion. I learned more from reading and thinking about your points than I remember. 
I also bought bitcoin as a tool to force myself to learn about it. I'm also trained as an economist, but a technologist at heart. This is a fascinating time for me
My thoughts on bitcoin and its value are still forming, so what you see below is meant as a work in progress. I will have to formalize an argument about this for my job soon, but for now, I stayed away from forcing myself to fit bitcoin into any monetary theory and just think of it from the perspective of technological progress. Sorry for the poor formatting, but I look forward to any response and thoughts.
I'll have to trim it and break it up into a few posts due to size limits.


This is not inherently bad, as it is the process of price and value discovery. Even mortgage securities and prices are higher now than they were when the bubble popped. Same for internet stocks. The market gets stronger. Business models get culled and evolution takes over. 


Ignoring the pejorative "bitcoin bubble", I agree that the inflation we are seeing is not following any new information about bitcoin. There is no news to those who already hodl. But there is new information to those who are just now starting to pay attention. The discussion about "new asset class" is what got me interested. In this way, the scale effect can be the main driver. If many are discovering this new asset and are simply allocating a small % of portfolios into this new asset class, purely to diversify, this should have a big impact.


First, let's talk about what an investment is. By definition, an investment is an asset that yields a return above its purchase price.
If you invest in bonds or equities, you're usually looking at some kind of discounted cash-flow to decide whether to invest or not. Either your bond will pay a coupon of $X per year, or your company will generate $X amount of cash annually - and you project these values over time. Then you compare that to the return on less risky assets, like the US 10 year Treasury, and decide if the return is worth the risk.
True, but there is also a legitimate speculative component. Buy low, add value (or let others do it), sell high. The price discovery works by identifying these opportunities. This is ok too. 


This is where it gets very interesting. I've also spent a lot of time, with econoimst-brow furrowed, trying to grok what's really happening, and how technology adds value to this digital bearer asset. 
I also saw Andreas' testimony in Canada and some of his other videos. I think he is spot on in that bitcoin will be an underlying base layer, and it should be seen as such. That is why it has value. I imagine this future: this digital bearer asset (bitcoin) is secure from all the properties of the blockchain. It is also highly liquid. I can change it into cash, I can lend or borrow against it, I can secure contracts, etc. 
In this model, the base stack gets value from the business models that it spawns. Bitcoin is analogous to TCP/IP. Imagine if you could monetize TCP/IP tokens. That is my mental analogy. An internet of value. A way to exchange not data, but value. 
Bitcoin in this model is not a currency, but it can be exchanged for any of the existing or new cryptocurrencies out there. Bitcoin is your stash of diamonds that you can, easily, exchange for a slice by simply converting a sliver into some other bearer asset (crypto-dollar) on demand. You can also lend it with a smart contract, without needing thugs to collect from your brother in law. 
The history of transformative technologies is a history of inventions that let new business models flourish. They enabled entrepreneurs to invent entire new businesses and new models. The technology became general purpose. The internet is the most recent example in that is allowed business models and is now general purpose. Bitcoin can do the same for value. 
If I try to box bitcoin into either currency or asset, I'm stuck exactly where you are. These options are defined by existing currencies and assets. But there is something different about crypto. And maybe it really is some new model.
Of course, one can speculate and day trade on any asset or currency. I don't disagree with anything you say about that and it should be pinned on the front page as an education to those who just want to get rich. But, that is orthogonal to understanding the source of long term value of bitcoin, IMO. 


Now, it's perfectly okay to buy another currency in expectation that it's price (against your 'native' currency) will rise. But that's just a trade, and one fueled by speculation. And some speculation is okay, it helps grease financial markets and discover 'real' prices. It's just important not to fool yourself, and to realize what you are doing. This also means no HODLing - every transaction has a lifecycle that ends in liquidation.
From what I've seen, and the yield on bitcoin, it seems like most people are betting there are greater fools out there.


The bitcoin mining curve is modeled after gold, the original 'hard money'. By design, it's supposed to be deflationary. I'll admit I've never gotten along well with gold bugs and usually don't persuade them, but I'm happy to trade against them.
There's hundreds of year of economic history demonstrating that deflationary currencies are bad for economic growth. Where deflationary currencies have existed, they've been out-competed by mildly inflationary currencies. This is why they don't exist anymore, except for brief periods of severe economic stress. The idea that real economic activity can occur with a deflationary bitcoin is contrary to both experience and theory, which shows that 'real' economic activity slows as people anticipate further gains in currency value. The incentive is to hoard instead of spending or lending, so they don't, and economic activity falls.
Likewise, gold has been a bad inflation hedge, and there's no reason to expect bitcoin to do better. The last hundred years of data shows that even in inflationary periods, stocks have performed better than gold (inflation adjusted, anyone who bought gold at it's local maxima in 1980 at $650/oz would still be underwater at 2011's global maxima at $1,900/oz). And needless to say, stocks have yielded many-fold the return over gold in that time period by dividends alone.
If you're holding bitcoin because you don't trust the dollar or are worried about inflation, you should ask yourself why you don't also hold gold. It's the same logic. Then you should ask yourself why you would hold either.
This is all fine and I don't have much to contend, except to restate that maybe bitcoin is neither gold nor currency. Imagine if the gold you had enabled an entire new ecosystem of businesses that can rely on gold as a base layer. Imagine you could alquemy-issue your own shiny metal that could be used to, for example, make contracts, or be carried in pigeons. But it was all priced and instantly converted to gold.
Suddenly the value of gold is as an underlying enabling metal, not as a hedge against fiat. 
I hope I'm making sense with this analogy. These things are usually so clunky and imperfect...

Yes. That was the point. The exchange is taking on the risk, for which it is receiving a large premium. It must have a way to hedge or mitigate that risk. I’m sure all those dollars are a tempting target for officials. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:40:12
I’m curious of who the other side of the transaction is? The exchange ends up with the cash that people are paying 100% premium to run away from. So what about them makes that a risk worth taking? Must be someone connected or with some guarantee. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:06
We agree on some points (those that are factual) and disagree on others (those of vision and expectations). This is a good place to be.
I would only argue that monetizing the network is exactly the value proposition of crypto. While TCP/IP packets are easy to lose, copy, etc, blockchain "packets" are not. Because of this, you can associate a value to it. You don't have to imagine monetizing TCP/IP. It has been done with blockchain. This is why I agree that this is a new internet where the packets themselves have an inherent value. 
Let me try another bad analogy because they are free. In science, the value of knowledge lies in the proof presented in the paper. That proof can be transmitted by any form of communication. I am arguing that crypto is akin to the mathematical proof that is immutable and verifiable. That is where the value is. Imagine monetizing these proofs as "tokens". It doesn't matter how they are transmitted and communicated. 
One could use these tokens to speculate against the exchange rate with fiat, or simply see that these proofs will form the foundation of an ecosystem of mathematical systems. This is a new form of investing where you are buying a piece of a new and growing infrastructure. 
Ok, enough with my imagination. Back to reality.
I agree that bitcoin doesn't need to have value to act as tokens to exchange fiat value. I got interested in Ripple for this reason and I expect that it will gain some adoption. But, ironically, Ripple doesn't allow for an ecosystem to be built around it. It only solves a particular problem. And it also doesn't pay any dividends, and doesn't appreciate. So, while I think it will be a great tool, I don't think it makes any sense to buy it. I don't even understand what its value means. I'm not going to use it to transact on SWIFT...
And no asset needs a value. Just to remember that we buy an asset because we expect to benefit from its features. We buy a house because it gives us shelter and is a good store of value. We buy cars because we value its use and the freedom it gives us to move about, even if its a terrible investment. 
I think there is a valid value of bitcoin in accessing the features of the crypto ecosystem. Compared to the other competitors, I agree that bitcoin is benefiting from first mover advantage. Buy I also place a lot of value in the quality of the team behind it. For the same reason I believe in Apple because of my understanding of their organizational culture and highly focused approach, I also believe that bitcoin core has proven themselves. If these developers left, I would quickly exit. This part of the value emerges from the quality of the software implementation and the trust I have in the FOSS structure they use. 
All this to say: Yes, I think there is a lot of speculation and I think the bursting of the bubble (again!) will shake the tree, but won't undermine what I think is the underlying value proposition of bitcoin. I think it will make it stronger. So I don't day trade and I believe in hodl to the moon (for now).

I’m not sure how to let no this correctly. 
This is great perspective on the needs for larger blocks. Or lack thereof. 
No block size increase is needed now. All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average. If inefficient and microtransaction usage is put aside, likely below 500k would be sufficient.
No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future. Before we reach the point that 1 MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:09:44
It’s not convincing. People arent buying bitcoin _because_ the price is high. They are simply speculating on higher prices in the future. 
This expectation is the reason we can consider this a bubble. Hodlers are also expecting the value to go up so are less willing to sell. The moment that expectation changes (for whatever reason) the profit taking will be rapid. 
I see it as a buying opportunity (I’m bullish on bitcoin long term), but without a buyer of last resort, only expectations of future value support it’s price. 
Nothing to do with a Giffen good.
