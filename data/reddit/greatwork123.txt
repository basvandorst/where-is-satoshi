 Money has to be intuitive. Whats going to happen is someones gona wake up with an idea, have the money to implement it into their own currency and all this junk will be behind us. 
1. infastructure
2. currency
3. ease of use
4. mass adoption
There were times of my life where i'd be more likely to find someone willing to trade me anything for a yugio card moreso than bitcoin today.

A good blackjack player can actually make solid stand at anywhere from 40-60% winrate. There are likely far more professional gamblers in that sector than successful bitcoin investors.

Why would you compare cooperate asset trading to currency trading?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:45
There is no bubble. this is solid ground. look at how many buy orders are being racked up after the next high gets hit. this is absurd. we gona be rich fam

I hate to break it to you but its about to tank down to its value which its diehard followers currently hold for- which is less than $5k.
Everyone realized that there's absolutely nothing which regulates bitcoin which, while being a good thing, is its demise. You can't just expect a currency to work when everything is based on trust in a world where no one can be trusted- hence the government.

I trust that over the course of my life- the government will keep me safer, financially secure, and stable than without them. The government isn't perfect, and that's due to everyone wanting different shit. 
For example, i once saw a governer propose something so dumb as to make students pay for every school bus ride. But everyone has  their reasons...

wow u made $70. Now imagine if you had invested 1k like me :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:57
I didn't place the order at $7500. That's just where it was filled. When i purchased it was going for around 5k. The market went all glitchy and my order was filled at 7500

My bigger worry is that bitcoin is going to run into some major problems as it tries to see wide adaptation. Steam already dropped it for example.

Its over boys. 
Im laughing and im a terrible person but even i feel a bit of sadness for some of us on this fateful day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:06
 Bitcoin has always been in a delicate state. 
What everyone missed was how BCH came into the market unannounced and shook everything up. Not only that- but several exchanges either glitched, scammed, or froze their markets. People who invest for a living take their money seriously and right now, as far as the average investor is concerned, there are no exchanges. 
Just a bunch of crooks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:49
If it makes you all feel any better i was one of the guys who got fukced by gdax when i placed a market order for bch.
I wasnt really going to stick with it- i just wanted to diversify.
Well i was able to get my hands on about 2k worth of BCH- at $7500. 
Needless to say its stuff like that, thats going to kill this currency. These exchanges are all run by clowns. This isn't monopoly money. I'm gona go invest in my electrician or something a bit more trustworthy.

Inheriting wealth. Strange example. If someone inherits wealth that means someone felt they deserved it. Even if their parent whoever feels like being born entitled the. To such wealth, that is their belief and worldview. I feel like people treat a fallacy like a fallacy and generalize everything using a fallacy. Oops thats a fallacy too isnt it

The banks have become the greatest scam in known history. Here, let me have your money for free, ill hold on to it and since i have the federal reserve on my side- if you take too much i can just print you up some more.
In the meantime ill be giving your money to someone else so i can charge them 20% interest :) :) :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:37:22
That means someone was scared enough to sell it to you at that price. wow
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:34:20
Ya it required id and phone number
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:11:07
HODL ONTO SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:22:33
It will but its not gona do that this month i can assure you
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:19:07
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:47:53
I'm held responsible by the currency i chose to use. If that currency means nothing to me then it doesnt matter how high the debts go. If i were a U.S. citizen with five million in debt in yen yet i had $20,000 and lived in the U.S. what's the worse they can do? Call me?
They can harp on my credit all day long, fact is, in the end, credit only means so much. Those who deserve wealth will get wealth. You think they would deny Elon Musk he had gone bankrupt a few years ago? Even if they did, someone else would take the opportunity.

Oh im buying the dip. Bought low and sold high. Time to do it again. But this time im waiting. Prolly gona see 6500 again.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:33:45
I dont have any loans right now but im fully aware on how they work
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:13:51
Its going back up. 
Here's the problem and i think the meta discussion to be had is about how bitcoin's future is grim due to high transaction costs. One day our tech will catch up to bitcoin and this wont matter. But as of today, this is bitcoins biggest and only threat. I may end up selling due to this.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:04:04
In about a week there's gona be some major players buying up bitcoin. All it takes is a spark and the dust is gona go flying off this thing faster than lil anne waking up in the morning. Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:42:49
I didn't place an order for anything, i simply deposited money into the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:59:51
We all wish. I remember at $500 i was gona but two bitcoins but the process of purchasing seemed so convoluted that i didnt bother. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:34:54
There was an additional fee on top of the exchange rate of about $15

They are IMO. They put a reality check on people and force them to find alternatives to the middle man.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:20
Don't feel too bad. I was actually doing fairly well till the gdax freeze scam that happened at the start of bcash.
