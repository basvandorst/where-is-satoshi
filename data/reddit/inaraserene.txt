Ultimately, it's true that the price of bitcoins themselves doesn't matter. The tech it introduces is the true value. Why does it matter if a bitcoin is worth $.01 or $1000, as long as there's still a distributed, decentralized financial network?

Just curious—are you against all payments platforms that aren't Bitcoin?

This is awesome! So cool to see people stepping up to share knowledge with a community who can truly use it.
One point of feedback: I do see that you include a slide at the beginning saying that this isn't investment advice, etc. **But I think you should absolutely say explicitly that the price of Bitcoin is volatile and there's no guarantee that it will stay the same even from day to day.** Therefore, if someone's living paycheck to paycheck (or client to client), they'll want to not hold the majority of that in crypto, but rather cash out to fiat. 
Yeah, I get that ideally we should all just have Bitcoin, and that's a great dream - but for now let's make sure sex workers don't lose a week's worth of work because of a price dip.

Actually, from a technical perspective it's necessary for 2 reasons: protection from DDOS'ing the network and acting as a bridge currency ([source]( Not arguing that the distribution off XRP was disproportionately given to RL, but a "native currency" is necessary for the network.

Erm, can you point to where the TSA ruled bitcoin to be cash?

Here are some [reasons]( [you]( [should]( [pay]( [for]( [porn]( if you're going to consume it.

Yes but that very clearly isn't a ruling... it's a lack of technical knowledge. I just think it's potentially misleading to list it with those other classifications, which are legal rulings.

They're a for-profit company running a currency-agnostic digital payments network. They're not associated with Bitcoin in any sense other than that they're both digital currency networks. 
As to why Bitcoin hates them, there's a couple possible reasons:
1. Bitcoiners tend to be wary of anything that compromises anonymity. Most of Ripple's gateways (how money gets on the network) are KYC (know your customer). The Bitcoiners who value their anonymity are against this sort of regulation.
2. Their close ties with banks and formal financial institutions makes Bitcoiners wary (see above).
3. Bitcoiners can sometimes have a knee-jerk reaction of dismissing altcoins or alternative protocols. In this case it may be warranted, but keep in mind that many Bitcoiners have a vested interest in Bitcoin (ie, they stand to lose lots of money if it fails).
