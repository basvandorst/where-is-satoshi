And bitcoin is one years old.

what Jan 2009, really? I thought it was 2015. Holy shit, that coin is old. I should buy. Probably all of them.

Why is this not removed by mods? I thought here on r/bitcoin everything that is not 100% positive gets a ban. Weird.

Is it a good idea to use their web wallet (greenaddress.it) for storing small amount of coins? (not as main wallet)

Yes but I heard exact the same 1 year before.
I would like to really know when they plan to push the final. Not the exact date, but 2016/17/18?

I was reading a year before about OB, many people are working on that project and much more are waiting for the final release.
But even after a year it is still far away from a final. Why? Do we have to wait 1-2 years?

Europe is just doing what USA is telling them.
So to stop all of this, at first we have to change the USA. And no, voting for hillary is not gonna change that.
