This BIP proposes replacing the fixed one megabyte maximum block size with a maximum size that grows over time at a predictable rate.
Transaction volume on the Bitcoin network has been growing, and will soon reach the one-megabyte-every-ten-minutes limit imposed by the one megabyte maximum block size. Increasing the maximum size reduces the impact of that limit on Bitcoin adoption and growth.

 , now you can see anyone's transaction if you have their ip address, geeks will know about proxy but not your avg. customer. :) 
edit: and it doesnt take genius to get location of ip, whois.sc/ip_adress_here shows you all the info.

check their blogs/forum , tons of people are waiting, people are waiting for more than 1 year and BFL has absolute no history of any working "single/minirig demo or working template or any guideline on when they will release products what is the number in any batch they release or any goal line for single to be sent, by some months i was being generous, i dont think they will even release BFL single by end of this year , maybe around dec this year , if we are hopeful at best, else they may simply not release.  
I just havent seen them giving out any demo at all and by that i mean working demo. they keep publishing random things via forum chat but there is no official page (the page they have just announces status right at the start of giving out product, does not give you any development status) or post of on-going weekly developments  , its absolute luck if they are able to give our singles and mini-rigs by 3-5 months at best, after that difficulty is going to be shit and your returns are not going to be what they are looking right now.    
The calculations i had 5 months ago was 300+ coins per month on bfl single ,right now its around 60 at best , i think after 4-5 months , it wont even be 20 coins per month , if the difficulty keeps going up the way its going . so take a guess. its not good at all, and bfl just keeps pushing the can down the road, they have absolute no goal at all. they want maximum pre-orders as possible, releasing single will simply kill their jal/little singles pre-orders.    
They only way they will try to work fast on single is , if people start mass cancelling, 1-3 cancels dont hurt them.   
Edit:corrected/added some stuff.

i was trying to remember a virtual currency that i did hear before , infact i used to see it as options in online carts too, i totally forgot about it, it was egold.

many jals fans are blowing out, prepare to see it die or replace the fan before it dies out. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:31:44
it may actually be more profitable to get BTC itself, i dont think they have started shipping at all, this demo is from broken rig , they are still trying to fix issue, and there is huge order waiting queue. just saying. also, it totally looks like huge scam if u ask me.
@_date: 2013-06-30 02:36:39
well my language is more of an issue than how BFL is working, then I think i know where you work from and what are your priorities.
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:10:10
i had order with them , my username was extremely close to username i created on their forum, after waiting for months i started seeing BFL has one of the WORST PR team and they are not afraid to ban u on forum and/or simply BULLY you in corner in front of everyone.   i got the feeling if i complain too much i wont get my money back, so first i got my money back and now i am alerting every one for months and months (Lol they just dont deliver still people cant think of why this company is not a scam) . BFL is going to be a HUGE scam , its pending, its going to be huge backlash to Bitcoin community and people who have invested millions with them, check check this source :  . enuf said.
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:13:56
@_date: 2013-06-08 11:41:35
i dont see a Single or little single delivered for atleast some months. i am not talking bout "look we gave 1 to developer , look here is first press demo shipped" i mean a real lot of singles to customers. thats not going to happen till months, when difficulty is going to go insanely high.
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:34:00
i really wish he showed the actual rig and whats up with the shady cell-phone camera? :/ totally disappoint.
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:41:58
WTF, is this some kind of demo coin? can i haz 1?
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:10:33
many people have lots of horrible stories of locked accs with lots of dollars stuck.
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:53:54
no ... no no no .. dont make it famous before i start my mining . god dammit why is this getting so much press.... :/ 
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:38:41
that was really nice and funny and hilarious and serious and funny at same time. I  really wish i could donate you some btc, but :/ i 0 to give. +100 internet hifis for now.
@_date: 2013-06-30 02:08:19
WTF was the annoucement of "WE are now able to ship 200 min- to 400 max units per day , 2 weeks ago? This fucking scam fucking company fucking with everyones fucking emotions and money. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:56:28
many users (first batch pre-orders ) payed thousands in BTC, they are all fucked and crying . 
@_date: 2013-07-09 04:29:29
but  i just learn multi-bit uses java, thats not good.
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:12:01
Nope, how can they wake up another day without fucking existing pre-orders , some customers are waiting for a year now, have you ever heard of anyone waiting for a year and still not sending lawyers to them for scam? BFL is un-fucking-unbelievable .
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:23:13
get 4 GFX cards and start mining today dont fall prey to this vapourwares. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 10:25:38
the wallet thing is still in infancy, the current methods of storing bitcoins are not streamlined, using windows desktop to store bitcoins has already looked so unsecure, many have lots bitcoins due to phish/hacking. Until wallet and storage of bitcoins is completely secure and so easy my pop/mom/gramp can do it, I dont think we should commence circlejerk, its just too early.   *ducks*
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:30:21
the way made official 1st asic delivered was such a load of crap, cant believe people didnt kick them , they gave 1 half assed open betaware machine to 1 developer who was controlling it remotely and they called it 1st sale. lol. even ponzi schemes take effort to hide stuff.
@_date: 2013-05-20 14:33:21
its a scam . hey are going to disappear in caymen islands as soon as they hit 10mil in orders.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:24:04
I think BFL will never deliver fully operational piece, it will be broken half assed , ready to blowup in 3 days crapware from china.
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:19:02
wololololo i dont even...aaahahahahaha
@_date: 2013-06-12 07:44:35
start your clock for 1 year countdown till you get it and by then it will be useless. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 04:28:11
anything that doesnt depend on java.
@_date: 2013-05-21 09:25:04
they are shipping 1-2 units every week, with total around 10 something shipped with 3000-5000 units waiting their orders, that is not shipping at all, its a huge scam. they cant ship and they are still accepting orders. cant believe people are still ordering.
@_date: 2013-07-18 06:18:10
why do u  say that?
@_date: 2013-07-09 06:23:18
why isnt anyone forming a bitcoin bank itself, any exchange who is creating accounts at any bank is completely relying on bank to carry its business , any bank can simply shut down account thereby shutting the exchange itself, I simply dont see any exchange can boldly claim to work smoothly without getting shutdown overnight if they are not having complete monetary control of their banking system (With fed) itself, it wont solve the problem completely but atleast make it stronger to take down instead of this overnightly shut downs and notices of "we cant handle usd transactions anymore in next two weeks". 
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:47:28
oookay..your attempt to curb my arm-chair computer scientist is...successful.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:10:28
whenever i visit this story, all i can see is ,its a fucking clown show, a vaporware product being announced 1 + year ago, people invested in it for more than year , and still no sign of proper delivery, wait till all this products are shipped and then they fucking burn in face and are returned back. i cant wait for that shitstorm to come. lol.  
people , just buy some bitcoins, literally, you will make tons of savings that way instead of buying in this vaporware.

Max kieser was always angry on tv, but recently , he is totally loosing it. Infact he is scaring his guest when he starts going in really loud  sometimes vulgar rants and then cuts back to his guest who are completely surprised, shocked and trying to recover themselves from the shouting by Max.   
In a recent interview with Alex jones, it was Alex jones who literally lowered his voice to minimum trying to calm max down, it was surreal to see max just not stopping at yelling and Alex looking calm and sane and trying to tell max to chill out, in end Alex also said Max needs xanax badly.   
I am totally onboard with max when it comes to his predictions and views on bitcoin but his recent rantings on Max Kieser report is totally Cringe-filled stuff, I get embarrassed when he is yelling mindlessly and someone walks in on me watching it.
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:43:25
exactly, I am sure they are planning to disappear soon this just getting rid of failed inventories. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:31:40
it will be better if they decide to use proven opensource more reliable structure and code for their exchange, everybody wins.

This guy is asshat, its not that he is utter idiot (he is slightly idiot) , he is clever, he is saying this so that banks/fin-stitutes just panic and start paying him to turn the chair other way around and shit on BTC.

one of my friend told me they will take 2 more months and actually ship out broken asics with no word or guarentee that they will replace them once issue is fixed. the more i read about this, it just sounds like a company selling a broken product with no absolute working model at all and funny thing is , some have invested money in it for more than year it seems, its just funny how people are not calling this scam. not a single working unit. :) 
@_date: 2013-07-11 03:30:50

Who are you, are you BFL employee? The  IMGUR album you posted in 9 months old, there is no substantive information here with real rigs, real hardware, real packaging, real shipping, the goalpost for shipping keeps getting announced and shifted with no real proof of actual hardware pictures or client names who will get their shipping or anything, it all smoke and mirrors show.    
I have said this many times whenever i see BFL thread here, its a huge scam, please beware, and also investing in real Bitcoin will be absolutely profitable and more returns than donating to this scam.   
Source:  and its old source , still this scam is living *sigh*

and this will not be answered.
@_date: 2013-07-09 05:17:24
heh, community is not making a decision on what i like so dont make a childish comment like that , i am talking about numerous hacks on java and constant updates/patches going at java which makes it extremely unsafe to handle something like your virtual bank-account on a machine. java is extremely unsafe and its just not me saying this , [check the web] ( .   
I have no idea why Bitcoin foundation choose to ignore such a huge flaw in client running on java. i for one will never use it to store my coins.
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:31:29
why not [bitcoin-otc]( , they also have verifiable [user rating system]( , very handy and nice, and you can use [web-irc like  too, i like it. you can tie it up with [GPG signature](  and your Bitcoin address too and its free.

@_date: 2013-04-14 01:55:00
I am not even a hacker but even i am enjoying this emokids squirm like little piggies in anguish . I totally like this..... make it burn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:05:17
they made mock demo's this time at 2013 conference , it really was not the real thing  but   just template of working long and small boards with heatsinks on them sitting in front of their  mock casings, they still have or had to work out temp. and voltage/watt issue.   
anyway, since i wrote my big reply, one BFL employee has suddenly started giving out exact figures on jalapenos going to be shipped daily etc, but still its all about jals, they still dont have any mention or goal line for littles and singles. which i am still sur they just wont release till all jals are out of the shop which mean atleast some months. which is very sad if  you are little/single or minirig customer waiting, right now BFL doesnt care about this.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:13:06
