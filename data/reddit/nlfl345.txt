I'm new to crypto and using the coinbase app to link my bank for purchases and the app Blockfolio to track.

I'm thinking that from my OP it wont ever go below 3500. I know its been lower in the past, but my guess is it wont get to that point again.

When community optimism makes that shift, we will be ready to ride upward to who knows when. As soon as we start seeing a rapid rise, more and more will jump on trying to maximize their profits to 10-20K maybe even more. I think when we get close to 20k again, people will jump off thinking that this is our ceiling. Causing the price to fall slightly or even kill the rise all together. I'd be pretty hard pressed to HODL past 18k.

Me jumping on the railing at $3900 thinking that ~4000 must be the bottom.

Met with our personal financial advisers today to go over retirement funds and what not. I reluctantly asked if they ever see interest in crypto currency, fearing they would laugh at me. To my surprise, they said they have lots of clients each pouring in hundreds of thousands into crypto. Not just younger people, but people in their 50's and 60's looking to get some coin into their portfolio. Spent the next half hour discussing crypto with old timer financial planners. It was eye opening to see their enthusiasm. 
We are in the infancy of something huge. Its only going to get more and available as a method of payment including more and more places accepting payment.

I feel that Bitcoin will have a hard time getting to 1k. My guess is that 1K-2k is very affordable and people will start buying around 2K causing the price to rise. My own recent guessing was that the bottom of this current downward trend was less than $4000 but more the $3000. If Bitcoin goes to 1k i'll be buying it like crazy.

I have a huge work bonus coming to the tune of ~20k most of that is going into bitcoin as close to 3k as I can get. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:02:29
In a way, I hope you're right. I'd love to buy into BTC at sub 2k. And I know we are all really just speculating about price, but i'd love to hear your thoughts on why you feel that it will go under my guess of $3500.

If BTC gets to 2k, it would really change my perception of crypto currency. It would indicate to me that very few "investors" believe in the future of the coin. Maybe I have this all wrong, but if people are not buying at the low price of 2k given the potential of crypto currency, then we are clearly not ready for what can be done with it. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:43:05
I'd wager that BTC will never go lower than $3500 
What makes me think this? 90% guessing and 10% thinking that there are too many people investing into it right now to allow that. 
If BTC goes to 2k, ill dump my entire investment funds into it.

I'm extremely new to bitcoin, so this may be a dumb question, but what would be the reasoning for miners to burn through cash trying to outlast the dip? Why not shut down operation and invest the expendable cash that would be "burned" into bitcoin while low?     
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:19:04
When though? Are you talking the most recent dip and bottom? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:15:19
I understand what you mean. I for sure have traditional investment funds and have recently been setting aside funds for BTC. Honestly at  the advice of my financial planner, but with lots of warnings regarding the risks. No risk no reward. I also believe in BTC and feel its way ahead of its time. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:23:49
I'm admittedly new to trading crypto, but from what I read, it looks like the establishment and central banking system is leeching its way into the culture and industry. I've read a lot regarding people concerns with this new form of finance being hijacked by the same powers that many are trying to break free from. So basically if Bitcoin somehow becomes regulated, controlled or highly influenced by establishment powers is when it could potentially "not make it" or at least not become what many have envisioned. 
I could be way wrong here too. I'm still learning.

I'm almost tempted to dump my investment funds into BTC if it even looks close to $3500. That's my personal bottom number honestly based on nothing other than the fact that too many people are involved. I've been slowly buying more and more while its under 4k. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:07:46
I think a lot of people, especially new comers to crypto (myself included) caught wind that Bitcoin was at a low point and people are wondering where the bottom was. No one knows if we hit bottom, but the logic being "we were close, so it can go up from here." 
Maybe the recent uptrend is do to a good bit of people seeing the recent price as "the bottom" and making large purchases to ride that trend up with many others thinking the same thing.

LMAO wot
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:01:56
I'm not worried. I've got less than 10% of my investments into crypto/bitcoin. Although I truly feel that it will rise a lot at some point. Just wanted to get in now that its low. I'll be buying more and more once I learn more about it. Its just funny because of how wrong I was right out the gate. Just dumped some money into a few coins and watched it fall. Still exciting given the potential. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:35:12
Bitcoin down to 3800 then back to 4100 - 4300 all week
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:28:25
I plan on selling most of my BTC at 20k if it gets there again. I guess that this is also a mental number that many others will sell at too.
