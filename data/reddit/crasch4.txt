I don't think cannabis is entirely risk-free.  However, relatively to many other commonly available drugs (alcohol, tylenol, caffeine, nicotine), the risks of cannabis are much lower (a statement which I think most medical professionals would agree with).  
As for the link between cannabis and schizophrenia, it seems plausible that cannabis is associated with schizophrenia, but I'm not at all convinced that cannabis _causes_ schizophrenia.  Seems much more plausible that schizophrenics take cannabis to alleviate their symptoms.

Actually "Marijuana is not harmful" is widely accepted by medical science.  Cannabis has a very high LD-50: 
"At present it is estimated that marijuana’s LD-50 is
1:20,000 or 1:40,000. In layman terms this means that in
order to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to
consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is
contained in one marijuana cigarette. "
By comparison, here's the LD-50's of other common chemicals:
Several prescription medications containactive ingredients derived from cannabis:

Cash transfers are difficult to stop/censor.  However, cash has other problems (government inflates it, bulky, not easy to transfer automatically), which bitcoin also solves.

Making it illegal would cause many businesses to not accept bitcoin as payment, nor advertise their goods with prices in bitcoin.  It would drastically slow adoption of Bitcoin, though eventually Bitcoin would win out, since it wouldn't be banned worldwide, and countries which adopted it would enjoy a multitude of advantages.

69% of firefighters are volunteers.  So, while it would be unusual, it seems quite doable to be both a fund manager and a firefighter:

If the Bitcoin network is so fragile that a few spammers can take it down for months, what do you propose that people who need to accept crypto payments do until the Bitcoin devs respond? 


What do you propose that people who need privacy _now_ do?  


Yes, it's a remarkable achievement.  Kudos to Satoshi and the Bitcoin devs for their progress so far.  
The Apple II was a remarkable achievement for its time as well.  But it would've been madness to suggest that people should only buy and use Apple II's, right?

Remember when Bitcoin devs allowed the transaction fees and confirmation times to spiral out of control for _months_?   Any business that depended on Bitcoin as a medium of exchange was _fucked_.  
Also, Bitcoin has no privacy or fungibility, and probably won't support it any time soon, if ever.  
New features also mean new bugs, so Bitcoin devs are understandably reluctant to add them.  If you want to try some new technology or feature, you have to use some other coin--no one's going to wait a decade for Bitcoin devs to support the new features.

No, since one of the main threats that anonymity protects against is government oppression.
