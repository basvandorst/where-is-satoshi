I invested small amounts over the last few months, so I'm one of the ones that got in at 18-20k... and with all the profits I've pulled from the alt runs, I am just now beginning to be in the red on my portfolio... I believe in the technology and its future so  while I'm sad to see it plummet, I figure I should've seen it coming since the growth we've seen was probably not sustainable.. Learning as I go and going to keep putting in more, just waiting for the bottom... where's the bottom :D

SAME :D having bought in at 20k and moved most of it in altcoins, I'm loving this

why the heck are you here then?
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:56:13
that was some nice word diarrhea

minimum balance is like 5k, why the heck would I keep 5k in my chequing account... 
I suppose using my CC absolutely everywhere would be a good idea since I'd be racking up more points, but just slightly harder to keep track of my budget

all the memes and ramen jokes going around on crypto twitter and reddit can still make me laugh so I guess I'm not rekt enough

Well if shit hits new ATHs this year, I would at least fix up the brakes and put some new tires on my 20 year old Honda...

all Canadian banks charge around 15$ /mo for an account with unlimited debit transactions

It's easier, I had no way of investing 100$ every other week into stocks? and make trades with very small fees. I've been in since december, and lived through the downturn - learning along the way. I don't think I could've done this in the stock market.

trade alts, turn that .25 into a few BTC

pop = popular / mainstream / shit that plays on the radio
and either way kanye is absolute shit
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:02:40
so every day I'm like... should I sell my alts and buy back lower.... nahhh 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:50:02
because crypto reddit and twitter is full of douchebaggy bros who listen to shitty pop music?

people with no API keys report the same, so it might not be related to API

There are none, but QuadrigaCX and Coinsquare are legitimate companies - you'll find people complaining about any exchange. You can also buy and sell locally at localbitcoins.com

what's a Crpytocurrencies
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:15:54
I mean there are some sites you can get verified quickly, buy with credit card and send directly to a wallet or exchange ... if you don't mind a 10% fee
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:00:35
Yeaaah, no problem at all paying insane fees to the banks, insane interest on loans and mortgages - and seeing infinitely small returns on your savings. Seems short sighted and too comfortable in your status quo to see the potential of a revolutionizing technology... Not to mention there are countries that definitely don't have this kind of security and crypto might make more of a difference there than anywhere else.

I'm 100% in ALTs ... but I mean their value is pretty dependent on BTC 
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:41:42
I bought in at like 20k, and then all the way down to 6k... 
I'm down about 50% of my initial investment, even with the strong profits I took out in December. 
I'm hodling some nice alt bags and being optimistic about it ;) 
If I had some more spare money I'd buy more right about now.

The fact that the most ridiculous conspiracies aren't on mainstream news doesn't mean there isn't a whole fuck ton of pseudoscience and shit news spread on there...

What the actual fuck?
