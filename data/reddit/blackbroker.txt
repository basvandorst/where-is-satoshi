the computer science and mathematics behind creating bitcoin is enough for me.

your coins are most certainly on the blockchain, otherwise they would not be bitcoins

no someone is sending bitcoin transactions to addresses who's binary matches lines of known virus code, I read this on yesterday and never thought it would become a problem as talked about as it is now. you can head over to that subreddit and check for yourself

Ok I'm assuming you are a troll because I'm trying to inform you on a subject that you don't seem to understand and in return you are correcting my English, asshole.

satoshis coins are on the block chain, as are everyone else's bitcoins. many of his bitcoin originated from coinbase transactions. the blockchain and coinbase transactions are not Blockchain.info or coinbase.com wallets/accounts they are integral parts of the bitcoin protocol and you should probably do some research into how bitcoin works

thats called arbitrage trading, the difference is caused by difference in fees and trading volume so while you could make money doing this, as you increase the demand on bitstamp and the supply on this other site then the gap in price will begin to close, however you can still take advantage of it at least in the meantime and if your trading alone isnt enough to close the gap

Calculus was actually invented by Newton for the reason of solving physics problems such as this so while most people think its pointless, as you've shown it clearly does have a point

42 of 48 states at the time voted to ratify so even if ohio wasn't a state the vote would then be 41 of 47 which is greater than the necessary 3/4 to ratify.

In which case, you've never used bitcoins. I think you have confused the popular online wallet service blockchain.info which capitalized on the name of the blockchain, which is the decentralized ledger account of all bitcoin transactions. Its either that or your just trolling, in which case fuck off.
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:09:39
seriously get a life other than trolling on people that are simply trying to explain how bitcoins work
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:28:18
yeah it is truly a unique attack. it has no benefits for the attacker and no damage is done to the victim, it simply just trolls on anyone with the bitcoin client running that also has AV software. heres the link

legally banks are allowed to loan out about 99% of deposits made at the bank, so therefore letting customers look at the banks liquid fiat assets would probably not sit too well with all of the customers
