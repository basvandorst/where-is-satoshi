@_date: 2017-12-22 06:58:43
lol i did the same i bought 0.1 bitcoins last night (it is my first bitcoin purchase) and it is dropping since that moment. all i can do is trust to the bitcoin veterans and hope it will rise in long run
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:36:35
Wow! Thank you so much. Now posts on this sub is way clearer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:18
I’m not going to ask you anything I’m just going to tell you that I bought my first 0.1 bitcoin at 18.7k to let you know how miserable and stupid I am.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:45:25
2+2 is ?
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:12:14
I know nothing about liquidation, shorts?, bulls?. Can someone who has time explain me what those are to me like im a 10 yo.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:37:41
No. I mean I bought 0.1 bitcoin when 1 bitcoin was 17k. And I just found out it was not even 17k, it was about 18.7 lol all i can do is to trust veterans and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:15:46
Christmas is yesterday so obviously it would not occur before christmas
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:58:22

@_date: 2019-07-25 17:16:07

@_date: 2017-12-23 08:23:32
If you had
One dip
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you buy
Or just let it slip?
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's coins in his wallet already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To buy coins, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole community goes so loud
He opens his wallet, but the money won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's buyin' now
The clocks run out, christmas is here, over, blaow!
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:13:19
I'm just a beginner right now so I'll just HODL until I know what I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:10:50
I want to buy $1000 worth of bitcoin but I can buy it on Tuesday afternoon (I live in Europe). Monday is christmas and everybody says prices will increase after christmas. Do I have time to buy before the prices increase or am I too late?
I edited the price 1000 from 10000. I mistyped. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:00:48
Also your English was pretty good :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:15
I bought my first 0.1btc yesterday at 16k and I don't want to do this shit again right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:14
Fuck! Dunno m8
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:43:58
I’ve never seen someone says big foot is real
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:14
I'm a newbie. Bought my first 0.1 yesterday at 17k. My palms are sweaty, knees week arms are heavy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:42:29
I’m nervous
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:14:08
The "price will rise after christmas" advice was from r/bitcoin but thanks
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:27:04
Thank you, I'm buying on Tuesday. Let's see where time will take me and my money
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:52:23
As I said I’m new in bitcoin but I see a LOT of this HODL thing can you (or anyone who knows the story) explain me the thing behind it. I only know a drunk guy misspelled Hold and wrote Hodl on a website but where, why and what was he talking about? Thank you!

@_date: 2017-12-24 16:59:18
Oh my god I wrote 10K sorry it should be 1K
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:58:41
It is not 10K it is 1000 dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:12:23
but the dip will rise eventually and LOTS of people say that time is after christmas
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:01:38
Guys I mistyped, it should be 1000 dollars not 10000. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 08:59:33
I've never seen a graphic as bullshit as this.
@_date: 2018-08-18 12:40:38
thats me
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:20:48
I'm using IOS :(
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:46:36
So is bread unsafe or ok?
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:54:08
Bought 0.34 at ATH :(
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:20:35
Using IOS
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:51:12
How is Jaxx?
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:17:57
19k club
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:44:14
This is graph is really bad. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 05:24:50
probably most of them bought at 17-18k because I did
@_date: 2019-01-23 09:03:32
I'm very unaware of crypto tech. What is this and should I do this as a hodler?
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:52:27
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:28:12
Is phone or pc better at btc storing?
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:45:11
Well I only have 0.05 so that treasure hunt thing is not for me. It is cool but it doesn't worth it. Still thanks.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:44:04
Like one in the safe and the other in my underwear closet or two completely different places like home and work?
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:27:17
i'm not familiar with the term "redditor" but maybe it doesn't mean what we think it is
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:44:17
And lastly, what is the cheapest way to transfer my btc from bread to electrum? It may sound stupid but I don't wanna make stupid mistakes.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:30:30
Not looking for a hardware wallet. So if phones are better. Any good wallets for IOS?
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:48:54
What do you recommend?
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:31:56
So pc is my best option?
@_date: 2018-07-21 07:22:06
Lol I live in Istanbul but this looks like some high cut percentage shit.
