15K+ unconfirmed transactions.

I had to change usual minrelaytxfee=0.00000001 (bitcoin core doesn't allow smaller number) to minrelaytxfee=0.00002 because of this. If bitcoin core takes 2 of 8 GB of my RAM, this is the point where my work with computer starts to get uncomfortable.
I normally keep 1 sat/kb minrelaytxfee because I believe everyone's transaction has the right to be relayed.

OR, just set listen=0 for the rest of your clients and forget about ports :)

I honestly think that when we come to this, people will need to start paying for full node services, and it's better for me as I'm running one. :) Protocol already supports that, see "services" in peer list of bitcoin core.

Happened once to me too. They got some of my wallets, but all of them were encrypted with 20+ characters, so no loss for me. (I was 100% sure that I had no malware and was running genuine Kaspersky a/v)
Since then, I never install teamviewer, only use "run only" when i need to help a friend remotely. this piece of software has been forever banned from my computers.

just a tiny correction: when you try to connect to main node that is listening AND syncing, instead of -connect=127.0.0.1 use -connect=127.0.0.1:8333 or else you don't know which instance you connected to (because there are N instances on 127.0.0.1) and might connect to some instance that is not syncing because, it also didn't connect to main node :)
Edit: Just FYI i was successfully running 11 (1 main + 10 extra) clients on same computer :)

Is there any picture of this artwork on internet? Maybe someone has a link?

He definitely didn't wanted centralized mining.

your own node / wallet / pool / whatever you mine against will not give you any extra rewards as EVERY node, that follows bitcoin protocol, does block reward checks before accepting block. You can generate million blocks, but only the one that has most proof of work will get reward, as specified in bitcoin source code.

So far I have only bought there, ~30 GBP of BTC total. I am full verified there, except bank account as I have nothing to sell.

I bet this is CoinWallet again. They promised us thousands of private keys but provided only 791 in last attack in september. Now they are just trying to get their coins back by putting together 100 inputs of 0.00001 and paying 1 satoshi/byte fee.

file recovery software will help You. I recommend getdataback for ntfs (it's easy to find it where pirates hung ;) )
It can recover almost any kind of file damage. Recommend using it asap before something else gets written where wallet was (physical location on hard disk)
