Censorship has nothing to do with the government.

Censorship has nothing to do with your "right" to do anything.
Censorship is the act of using power, any power at all, no matter how small, to attempt to silence other people, or discriminate against people because of their speech and/or opinions.
It has nothing to do with laws or the government or anything like that.
I am not sure why you are bringing up "rights" when rights have nothing at all to do with whether something is or isn't censorship.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:07:48
I never stated that you have the "right" to appear on someones radio show. 
I am not sure why you keep bringing up people's "rights", when it has absolutely nothing to do with censorship. You should stop bringing up irrelevant things. 
If a radio show is using it's power to suppress certain opinions or speech, yes that's censorship. It also has absolutely nothing to do with your rights.  Yes the radio show has the right to censor who ever it wants. That doesn't change whether or not they are engaging in censorship.
But to repeatedly the same statement, one last time, just so you understand. Whether you have the right to do something or not has absolutely nothing at all to do with whether an act is censorship or not. I wonder if you are going to continue talking about "rights".
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:38:53

Yes they have the right to censor people if they want. It is still censorship though.

Merely that this is what they are doing.
Censorship has absolutely nothing to do with the government, and Bitcoin was created to help people get around censorship.

Click on the link Satoshi posted.
Here is the quote in question:
I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.
So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage.
The payment processor has connections with many nodes.  When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends.  If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.  A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it.  The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes.
The quote "I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less." is an explanation of how 0-conf works.

Hey, here is the full quote:  
[  
  
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.  
[**Quote from: bytemaster on July 28, 2010, 08:59:42 PM**](  
Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.  
See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.

Easy.  The defending pool would just orphan all those blocks.  And now you spent a 100k to mine blocks that now got orphaned.
It doesn't matter how many blocks you mined ahead of time, as thats just more money you'd lose.  IE, you mine 20 blocks, well the defending pool just ignores those blocks and mines 30.  You lose all your money, and they lose nothing.  
It would be a little unprofitable to defend in this manner.  But it would be 100X more damaging to YOU.  Whos got the bigger money bags to throw away?  I doubt its you. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 04:39:14
Well, if those blocks were obviously an attack, IE they were mined in a hidden manner, and reorged a bunch of transactions, then that would be a great reason to orphan them.
I think people really underestimate how easy it would be to tell if someone is attacking the network.  If a bunch of people lose money, and a bunch of transactions get reverse, due to hidden mining, thats an attack.  Orphan it.  


Well, we are only talking about obvious attacks here.  So yes, if you engage in an obvious attack, why would anyone really care if you lose money?  
@_date: 2018-08-20 04:42:43
No, they dont hardfork.  They simply mine more blocks, and ignore the blocks that the other person created.  
Yes, they would temporarily have a longer chain an higher difficulty, but that would quickly change as someone else just ignores the blocks and creates an even longer chain.
The way that it would determine which blocks to exclude is to simply ignore any obvious attacks.  It really is quite easy.  If someone mines 20 blocks in secret, and then releases them all at once, and the chain reorgs a bunch of transactions, then that is obviously an attack.  That doesn't happen accidently.
You COULD counter this by saying "well ok, I won't mine 20 blocks in advance, I'll just mine 3 blocks, and nobody will be able to tell!". 
And you'd be right, you could do that, but what would even be the point?  You reorged 3 blocks.  Probably nobody will even notice, as any big transactions will require more blocks than that to confirm.   
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:58:24
Well, for a large transaction, they would presumably require more than 3 confirmations.
Its not a hard fork.  The other party would just ignore your blocks, and mine more blocks, such that you are no longer the largest chain.  This doesn't have anything to do with BCH specifically.  This is in regards to any chain where 1 party has a bunch of hashpower in reserve, that is not being used, and put it towards defending against an attack.  
The way to catch something like this is if you are a miner, to simply ignore any hidden mined blocks that create a large reorg.  IE, if someone reorgs 20 blocks, the defending miner just ignores it, and mines more blocks than you just did.  
Thats not a hard fork.  You have the longest chain only until the defending miner mines more blocks than you did.  Which would happen pretty quickly.  It doesn't have to be instant.
So you would "reorg" the chain, for a couple minutes, and then your reorg would be reorged right back to where things were before, except this time you just lost a lot of money.  
Detecting reorgs isn't difficult, and I am not sure why you think that it is.  If 20 blocks get transmitted to the network, that nobody saw before, then thats obviously an attack.  Whereas nobody accepts a large 3 confirmation transaction, so it isn't even an "attack" at all.

Well it is too late for that.  Core supports a blocksize increase.  They did it with Segwit.
The precedent has already been set.
@_date: 2019-03-12 06:03:24
Isn't your full node already screwed if they are able to sybil attack you?
If they 100% sybil attack you, then the miner can just prevent your node from looking at the current state of the blockchain, and instead feed you an old state that they control.
Even though the old state of the blockchain is "valid", they can still double spend you, and steal from you in the same exact way that they could attack an SPV wallet.  Your full node is still being stolen from, in the same way, and doesn't protect you, from a sybil attack.
@_date: 2019-03-12 05:59:06
Didn't we already have this whole debate, back in 2017?  
The big blockers lost.  The full node, small blockers won.  That was the consensus.  Anyone who disagrees with this is outside of the network consensus.  
If you truly believe that users should just use a light client, and SPV verification, then why are you even involved in BTC?  It is the alt coins that are trying do that.  Bitcoin is for the people who support true decentralization, on the other hand.
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:01:48
Sure, you have the right to ask for whatever you want.  Other people don't have to give you that price though.  
It seems that they no longer valued the condo at 20 BTC.  They valued it at a much different price.  Even if you don't care about price fluctuations, you cannot force other people to agree with you.
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:35:01
What are you talking about, this is the OPPOSITE of selfish.  Smaller blocks makes the network more decentralized.  They are voluntarily giving up money, in order to make it cheaper for people to run their nodes?  Whats not to love about smaller blocks?
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:03:49
We can't fix past blockchain growth.  We can only fix future growth.  And if the blocksize is reduced by x%, then that means that the increase in cost will also be reduced by the same exact x%.  
Your argument is the same exact argument that big blockers use.  This is exactly the same as reducing the blocksize.
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:41:31


Well the paper that decribes the technology does.  I'll quote section X of the paper.  
"In this section we lay out the suggested initial settings and growth limits for sharding and the per-shard flexible weight limit in bitcoin"
This part of the paper specifically "suggests" something for bitcoin.
"which provides a total aggregate transaction processing rate of 4.45 MWe every 10 min, only 11.25% more than the original maximum block weight."
This part proposes an initial effective transaction capacity increase of 11.25% (ie effective blocksize increase).
" resulting in a maximum adjustment of around ±14.5 %/yr"
This part suggests that a maximum adjustment of up to a 14.5% year blocksize increase.
"We contend then that these maximum limits are within the realm of reasonable demand in the circumstance of total world adoption, while also within the limits of what foreseeable technology might enable within the decades it would take"
Here the paper contents that this blocksize increase is reasonable.
I am not sure how you can claim that the paper isn't proposing this for bitcoin, when section X specifically states that this is "in bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-10-07 07:07:31
Didn't a couple years ago you said that if a controversial blocksize increase was pushed through that you'd quit?
Why are you pushing a blocksize increase, that is certainly going to be controversial?
@_date: 2018-10-07 06:55:49






It is not about some magic, arbitrary limit.  It is instead a continuum.  The smaller blocks are, and the more empty blocks that exist on the network, the cheaper it is to run a node.
It is a good thing to save money for people running nodes.  And it also a good thing to make sure that fees are high, so as to support the security of the network.  
If someone can't get their transaction into the blockchain, then they should raise their fee.  
All of this stuff was covered a year ago during the blocksize debate.
@_date: 2018-10-07 06:53:20


Why is this bad?  Reducing the blocksize is a good thing, not a bad thing.  
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:22:22


Yes it does!  Smaller blocks, as measured in data size, are cheaper for nodes to download.
Every time someone mines a block, it has to be distributed to the entire network.  And the larger that blocks are, the more expensive it is to run a node.  Empty blocks are good for the network, as it is less data that your node has to download.
We had this entire discussion a year ago, with the blocksize debate.  Go read the arguments from the core developers.
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:36:33
Smaller blocks makes the network more decentralized.  Large blocks makes it more expensive to run nodes.  Why do you support centralizations, by trying to force bigger blocks?
@_date: 2018-10-07 08:59:41


Exactly.  Which is why smaller blocks are better.


Actually it does.  If 50% of blocks are empty, this is the same thing as if the blocksize was cut in half.  Instead of 1 MB every 10 minutes, you'd only have 1 MB every 20 minutes on average.  
Empty blocks a certain percentage of the time is the same thing as a blocksize decrease, which helps the network.

The whole point that the person is trying to make, is that it is technically true, but extremely misleading to say that the blocksize limit of bitcoin is 4MB.
It is extremely misleading to say that, because usually what people are interested in, is the \*average\* blocksize, not the max blocksize.  So if you keep bringing up this 4MB number, and making such a big deal about it, then it tricks people into incorrectly believing that it has anything at all to do with the average blocksize, which is the only real number that matters.
You seem to be trying to make a huge deal about this 4MB number (which is mostly irrelevant), when you instead should be talking about this \~2MB average blocksize number, which is the \*actually\* relevant number to a discussion that revolves around transaction capacity of a blockchain.
The same thing applies when you talk about the " 4 million units" limit.  Real life people don't think in, uhh, weight units.  They think in megabytes, when talking about computer storage space.  Talking about 4 million weight units, incorrectly misleads people into the false conclusion that the bitcoin average blocksize is larger than it actually is, even though you've stated a technically true statement.
\&gt;  point out a single statement I made that is factually incorrect. Stop reading between the lines and making assumptions
You are stating a multitude of technically true statements, that imply a false overall narrative.  The false narrative that is being implied is that the average bitcoin blocksize is 4MB, when it is actually on average, around 2 MB.
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:18:23
Sure.  
At the very top of the post, in the bitcoin.stackexchange thread, the questions is about a tweet that says the following:  
" HTLCs don't work for micropayments (below tx fee level) ".    
This tweet is clearly referring to the definition that Peter is using.  IE, that it is not economically viable to protect payments that are below the fee level.  So if fees are 50$, transactions below 50$ are unsafe.  
The response then incorrectly starts talking about the minimum transaction fee relay limit, as follows:  
" At the default minimum feerate of 10 nBTC/vbyte " .....  " Alice accepts that she's going to lose those 4 nBTC ($0.00002 USD at $4,000 USD/BTC). "....... " -people who don't want that risk can simply disable routing payments below about $0.02 " ........  
As you can see, it refers multiple times to the 0.02 cents number, but completely ignores the 50$ number that is referenced in the original question.  
Not once does it refer to the actual question that the original poster brought up.  It just ignores it entirely and talks about something different.    
So, yes, while it is true that the post is specific about what it refers to, it annoys me that someone can just ask a question, and the responder will just completely ignore the question, respond to something else, and pretend like the question has anything at all to do with what the question originally asked.
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:31:06
I am not sure why people seem to be unable to understand Peter's argument regarding "dust" transactions.  
Peter is using the term "dust" to refer to transactions below the current fee level.  So if fees are 50$, then all current balances that contain less than 50$, are "dust", because it costs more money to send them, than they are valued.  
If you have a balance that contains less than 50$, then your balance is effectively worthless.    
He is absolutely not used the word "dust" to refer to things that are below the network relay limit.   
The stuff that you posted, seems to be using the 2nd definition, and not the definition that Peter is using.

But people are using this right now. So it works. 


Ok, and what about merchant devs, as weighted by market share? You know, the ones that are actually driving adoption of Bitcoin payment acceptance, so you can actually pay with your Bitcoin?

Your link happened in 2015.  A whole lot has happened since then.
If there is event a small minority that disagrees with a blocksize increase, the there is no consensus.  By definition, you have to prove that almost every single people wants a capacity increase, in order to make it happen.
And there are lots of people who do not want a capacity increase.  People such as Luke-jr, who are very influential in the space.  
Also, I literally linked you a twitter thread that had a lot of people disagreeing with a capacity increase.  
As long as it is possible to find twitter threads like that, consensus does not exist.
@_date: 2019-01-27 01:22:37
There is absolutely NOT consensus for a blocksize increase.
In fact, many people, include some prominent Core Developers, actually want to decrease the blocksize.  
Luke-jr, for example, suggests that you shouldn't use segwit at all for normal transactions, as segwit increases the blocksize (through a soft fork).
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:28:38

People in this thread are disagreeing with you.
In order for you to prove that consensus exists for a blocksize increase, there has to be basically nobody who oppose a blocksize increase.  In reality, a lot of people oppose a blocksize increase.
"consensus" is not a majority vote.  Instead, it is more like a veto, where a small group can prevent any changes and force the status quo.  Existence of basically any opposing means that status quo will remain.  
Just go take a look at the comments in this thread, for example:  [

I am very confused about how you can say this with a straight face.  
BIP 70 is probably one of the MOST used features, for in person transactions.

This is not how segwit works.
Segwit is a blocksize increase.  And YES it DOES increase operating costs, in the same way that any other blocksize increase does.
Go read what the ACTUAL developers have to say about segwit in the OFFICIAL segwit FAQ:
It says it right there that segwit is a blocksize increase.  And people such as Luke-jr are actually upset that a real blocksize increase was included in segwit.  Many wanted to keep the blocksize limit the same.

The LTC extra "capacity" is equivalent to a blocksize increase and has ALL the same disadvantages as any other blocksize increase.

I am talking about whatever bitpay uses/requires to be compatible.
This makes up the majority of in person transactions. (Because the majority of in person transactions are run through bitpay)
I'd also find it unlike that a majority of wallets, weighted by in person usage, aren't compatible with the majority of store fronts.
Perhaps if you just take a naive count of wallet software github Repos, your statement might be true, but not if you actually look at the weighted usage rates of wallets that people actually use in real life to make payments.

Ok, now how am I supposed to take this argument and convince my local bar of this?  
My local bar wants fiat, and there isn't anything I can do to convince them of this.  But, if the payment processor accepts Crypto, and converts it instantly to fiat for the bar, that is a much easier sell.  
\&gt;   its not like you enable or disable it with a switch   
Other payment processors do indeed enable it with a switch, though right?  Like most other actual, real life payment processors that accept crypto have the ability to convert automatically to fiat, right out of the box.

I don't think you understand how this works.
Ok, lets say fees on bitcoin are ~10 dollars on average.
If you put in a payment fee of 9 dollars, your transactions might confirm within an hour.  This is because blocks are full.
Now, lets say that fees on bcash are at 5 cents on average.  If you put in a fee of 10 cents, then your transaction will almost certainly confirm within the next 10 minutes.
This is because blocks on bcash are not full.
Thus, it is both faster and cheaper, at that price point.
Yes, the reason why this is the case, is because not many people are using bcash, but in theory they can handle 4 times the transaction volumn.  So it could be both faster and cheaper.

This isn't true.  Segwit was a blocksize increase. Full stop.  It was a soft fork blocksize increase.  It has all the same advantages and disadvantages as any other soft fork blocksize increase.

Do they \*accept\* bitcoin, in exchange for products?

..... Are you aware that you are in a Bitcoin subreddit?
What did you think the entire point of Bitcoin was, if not to collapse the banks. 
Are you aware of the message that Satoshi made in the Genesis block, about the banks?

The answer is because the Lighting network is a very long way from being completed.  The stuff released now is just an alpha version that nobody really should be using, and thats according to the lightning devs.

The entire point it Bitcoin is to get rid of the banks. 
I though this was a Bitcoin subreddit.... Lol

Saving hard disk is irrelevant, so I am not sure why you are bringing up a "benefit" that all the experts agree does not matter.  Hard drive space is not the bottleneck, and never was.  
The bottleneck has always been bandwidth, and is the relevant discussion point in all of the blocksize debates.
Whenever anyone who is knowledgeable at all about the blocksize debate is discussing it, they are always talking about bandwidth, and not irrelevant things like harddisk space.

This isn't some huge blocker here.  It is possible to increase the blocksize as much as we want, using only a soft fork, through the use of extension blocks. (segwit, for example, was literally a soft fork blocksize increase)  
Soft forks can do almost anything that a hardfork can do, if you are creative enough.

This is also not true.  It is actually slight less efficient, as the transactions have to include a couple extra bits of segwit data, on top of both the transactions and the witness data.    
An updated node still requires the entire block, in order to validate it correctly.    
There is no bandwidth savings here.  
This was all covered quite clearly in the segwit FAQ:
