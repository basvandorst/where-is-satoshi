I have 62 cents in my account and I still reacted like this! That's just the magic of magical internet money...
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:37:59
You need to see a psychologist :D
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:26:45
Hehehe... thank you! I've always been a highly avid shibe and not really a bitcoiner, but I like the more positive vibe of this community lately, and I'll definitely start to be more active :)
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:37:00
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:11:41
You must be a delight to be around :)
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:28:36
Thanks! :D

Sorry, I'm *extremely* new to cryptocurrency
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:46:10
But seeing as I have a hosted wallet, how do I put btc from the tip into the account?
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:33:40
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:29:37
At first I thought you meant to say 'buy *with* bitcoin'... but that's really cool!
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:16:16
Yes, and you need someone to buy said coins, meaning that the "bad coins" will all still be out there.

@_date: 2014-02-09 03:13:50


Ever thought that the so called "dogetards" say stuff like "to the moon" is because most of them actually enjoy a bit of fun and humour, like regular humans. You, on the other hand, are not making bitcoin users look so great.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:32:58
I hope you are happy with your personality :)
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:48:48
Thanks, let's see if this one works! 
1 fart Edit: The fart tip worked!
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:07:56
Oh, it probably is :)
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:13:51
This is exactly what I'm talking about; you think that just because bitcoin is worth a lot you can go around condemning every other coin. In cases like these, don't even think of them as coins; think of them as communities.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:32:58
It's beautiful!!
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:17:22
Oh, thank you! And it seems like a smart thing to do... too many zeros otherwise :P
Besides, it's more fun!
@_date: 2014-05-17 23:05:30
Hey, that's a really cool idea! I need to load up a few bucks so I can do some stuff like that! :D
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:35:02
Then why bring it up in your original comment? Anyway, I wasn't even talking about OP's post. 
Regardless, you are an outstandingly *lovely* person :)

@_date: 2014-05-10 00:46:19
Oh, I have already commented, so there's no need to tip me, but here are some tips I've done, as requested! :D
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:36:48
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:33:41
Yes, they came through! Thanks again for that

No problem :)

*slips, accidentally tossing drink into bashco's nose*
broken nose Edit: Okay, *this* one didn't work...
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:04:38
We're not really too worried about that, there a far greater things going on within our community at the moment :)
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:10:05
Thanks oprah! :P
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:46:15
I like this one! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:38:24
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:34:02
Indeed :)
Keep it up!

Nice! I need to sign up finally :P
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:45:53
One thing that btc users need to understand that dogecoin users won't see a 5 doge tip as $0.001. They see it as 5 doge, and that is something special. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 03:32:24
Just passin' by... I was just on the changetip site, and your tips come up almost non-stop! Good on you ;)
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:35:52
Dogecoin users don't see their tips as a fraction of a penny, they see it as "XX Dogecoins". I know it's hard to do with bitcoin when it's worth $600+, but it's something that (99% of) the dogecoin community does with pride. I would happily accept  26 cents in tips any day of the week.
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:44:50
Aww :(
Edit: Try looking for another button, I think there's another one for it :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:40:26
Hehehe... that is possibly the best analogy I've ever heard :P
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:28:38
Well, okay, I'm convinced! :P
50 bits
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:40:58
Actually that wasn't me, it was the other people who agree that you are too lovely for upvotes :D
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:20:03
This is great! Nice work to all of you guys!
@_date: 2014-06-10 23:51:44
That's awesome! I look forward to the updates
@_date: 2014-05-29 06:30:12
Nice! That must've been awesome for her! :D
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:32:18
Thanks, but I have since found out how to transfer the changetip money!
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:48:56


Well, shit. O_o
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:26:33
Good luck! I'm Australian, but I hope it all goes well! ;)
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:04:35
Well, I suppose porn and sandwiches aren't really that bad
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:38:58
It's back up to speed, but there were tips being verified that were 12+ hours old.
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:03:59
Hey, thanks! :D
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:02:05
Sorry, but seems to have beaten you to it!
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:28:28
Thanks! And you're very right, it sounds much better! It's like tipping 5 doge vs tipping $0.005 :)
@_date: 2014-05-23 09:01:02
Wait... this is a thing? :D
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:51:58
You can add it yourself for your personal use :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:18:46
Seriously, downvoting every comment he makes? He's bringing up a relevant issue, in a polite way, and it seems that all it's provoked in half of you is the "ooh, dogecoin, must downvote!" spasms.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:21:05
Is that a full bitcoin?...
Edit: Okay, I have since read that it is (sorry, not really much of a bitcoiner!). That's crazy!
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:30:09
Sheesh man, you're insane! I saw that tip to mohland too!
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:02:32
Thank you! :D
^(Btw, do  you know if the giveaway tips verified yet?)
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:36:53
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:12:46
You say that like nobody here is Australian.
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:31:35
Aaah, I see watchu did there! Thanks :)
And I will definitely subscriber ;)
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:41:15

@_date: 2014-05-17 08:12:57
Thanks for the tip!
When you go to the tip amounts page, it should have a blue link saying "add your own moniker" in the paragraph of text titled "special tip amounts". A bar will then pop up below for you to type in :)
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:08:44
Thanks! I'll check it out! 
^(well, after I get some btc anyway!)
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:36:23
@_date: 2014-05-13 23:51:00
Congrats! Puts my few millibits to shame :P
@_date: 2014-05-17 09:25:59
Okay, it's also disappeared for me now, and my custom moniker didn't work when I tried it. Weird...
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:12:00


Nah, I just find it interesting (I'm new to crypto!).
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:42:33
You act like I was trying to entertain you
