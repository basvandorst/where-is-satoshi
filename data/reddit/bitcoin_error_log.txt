Just a story for people interested in any of the facets of Bitcoin entailed. No pressure!
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:10:10
At what valuation of iFinex? Isn't that just one of the companies that make up Bitfinex?
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:01:20
Maybe Vitalik just changed his tune after reconsidering at Bitcoin Europe 2013. Maybe Jordan was the one trying to make it into an investment opportunity &amp; Vitalik decided to distance himself from it. Maybe Vitalik was never a partner at all &amp; Jordan exploited him to appear as one by having him explain some technical aspects on stage for him. I don't know everything behind it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:44:36
If the keys are compromised, does that mean they took all the bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:23:21
Can't argue with that.
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:13:05
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:15:09
Only need to identify whether a coin has touched any non-whitelisted LN channel to be 'suspicious'. Theymos implies that's not possible though.
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:28:26
People really seem to wanna give their bitcoins away too though...
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:41:56
I think maybe you are taking it personally for some reason. FWIW, I added some tweets to the end of the article, from other people that were there.
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:35:13
Will coins that touch an LN washing channel be marked themselves as having been there, giving authorities a way to mark LN coins as suspicious?
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:25:39
Maybe you are right, not sure it matters though!
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:22:59
Yes, I think so. But, 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:59:51
You mentioned the need to settle affected accounts' positions. Did that occur already before the site went down?
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:24:47
All I've really got is the video associating him with the concept of quantum computing in Bitcoin. It's okay if you don't believe me. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:58:32
Some of the Bitcoin community in my sphere asked about it on multiple occassions and now I can just point people to this post. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:21:43
If you say so!
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:04:44
Fungibility and public ledgers are incompatible.
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:27:53
Eh, I'm not sweating whether it was a scam at this point. I kinda like that it happened.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:50:11
What % of coins were stolen?
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:46:20
No worries, let it remain as evidence of how little I know about quantum computing. Also, I'll leave it to trigger anyone that notices.
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:27:03
Hey shitcoins need love too.
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:16:33
So you don't want anonymous?
@_date: 2016-04-29 13:48:22
LOL... I can't even.
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:30:46
Bitcoins are not fungible. Outright.
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:30:19
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:02:06
Are there any types of accounts or settings that unaffected accounts have in common?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:18:43
None of your examples actually map onto the situation. Bitfinex and BitGo left the keys to the vault on the lobby table.
We don't even know how things really work in Bitfinex's setup, so we can't go acting like this was a heist of personal belongings out of storage containers. 
Another HUGE difference here is that Customers do not have keys to their own coins. All of your examples use situations where the customer is clearly able to have their own key and add or remove contents of their container. There is no 3rd party keyholder (like BitGo) either.
If I lent someone 1BTC on Bitfinex's swap market, what happens if my account was hacked? What happens if the borrower's account was hacked? Both?
@_date: 2016-04-19 11:58:34
This. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 11:12:33
Because the concept of frictionless arbitrage is an oxymoron. They will realize that you can't connect multiple markets without effectively becoming one market. Exchanges aren't looking to merger afaik.
@_date: 2016-04-23 11:51:59
If transfer of any currency, particularly USD, is near-instant, all arbitrage will be controlled by the party with the fastest connection to that network. Spot price difference between the exchanges would mostly be determined by their fee structure.
Honestly this all ignores the biggest problem with Liquid. One exchange has to trust the other to not issue bad fiat tokens, and settle fiat with each other efficiently.
I really don't understand why any exchange would want Liquid. But maybe there is more to it than we realize...
Oh, don't forget they wanna secure it with thermite or whatever. Meh...
EDIT: Note that Liquid says first version is bitcoin xfer only, and that 'assets' would be added later.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:20:29
This list sucks. Lots of stuff that shouldn't be recommended.
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:42:55
What you are describing is an effective commoditization of exchanges themselves. None of them want to compromise their current volume by sharing it with competitors freely. None of them are in any rush to compete solely on software features.
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:38:04
Easier to withdraw bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:07:21
No thanks.
@_date: 2016-04-27 11:46:36
@_date: 2016-04-23 11:13:54
Gavin didn't say that. The headline is clickbait and the website is shit.
@_date: 2016-04-21 11:43:18
1. They have a few outspoken people that are often wrong or delusional about problems of Bitcoin. Namely, Peter Smith has no respect from anyone who knows anything about Bitcoin.
2. They have a habit of identifying a problem with their own services and blaming it on a problem with how Bitcoin itself works. They will block social media of people that point this out.
3. As a start-up with no way to make money, they are scrambling to find a way to stay alive, this will likely result in them doing more of  and ultimately behaving more like an enemy of Bitcoin than an ally, by trying to shape it into something that fits within a slice deck their VCs would throw money at.
4. If you work there, be prepared to be seen this way unless you are prepared to maintain a blog that publicly shows you are a free-thinking reasonable person, ready to challenge your colleagues. Because Blockcain.info is a clown show at this point.
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:00:00
If they are smart, they scrapped the whole idea.
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:31:37
Basically, 'we don't make money but have decided that if we dream big we can have yours, and no, we won't give you stake in kind with your risk, nor will we provide proper info for due diligence' 
How the heck do you give 10% off on a Dutch auction anyway?

oh fuck off already, it doesn't matter.

Maybe we just think it's shit.

It works when employed with skillful risk management. Not as easy as it sounds, but yes, the people that last long enough to make a career out of it do make good money.

Fair enough.

I just assumed bitcoiners use Android over iOS by a large amount, but what do I know...
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:43:19
I am against Gavin's proposition, and merely cautious about dynamic/elastic "solutions". Generally I am a conservative when it comes to protocol changes. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:07:10
You can iron out Android bugs via iOS platform?
@_date: 2015-12-16 02:54:49
At least you went to this knowing how it would it end.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:36:11
It's not an argument on the debate, that's in the op, grow up. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:35:45

You want the job or what? ;)
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:35:55
Raise the fees dynamically with the size, if you must. Remove any possibility of real estate being discounted or inflated.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:21:18
There is data that can provide more than that: age of account, proportion of comments related to keywords, time density of posts, etc.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:41:34
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:56:40
This makes so much more sense.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:09:08
Then we simply disagree. Bitlicense has no influence on, or correlation to Block Size. Block size has no influence on adoption... Bitlicense sure does though.
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:15:04
Great work and I will include you in the bounty. As I requested from the other guy, can you provide list of Reddit threads included?
I'd like to do some manual research, using that and the work so far.
I have one other person I am working with to verify both of the source data sets researched so far.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:07:09
That's the thing, I suspect the "desperation" may be manufactured. 
The only resulting action required will be a report, which I'll be happy to help with, and publishing all findings for free.
Whether the study is waste of money is my problem and no one else's.
If I thought it was necessary to design a solution, maybe I'd spend btc on that instead, or as well.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:26:22
Pretty sure you're just trolling me at this point. I'll ask again. How is referencing the current success of the free market within Bitcoin an argument to change Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-13 11:08:12
1. Nice initiative, I do wish you had contacted me first, as I mentioned in my tweets, you seem to be the only person interested that didn't. The spec was a first draft and sent out for feedback only. The current plan is to coordinate as a team of multiple people.
2. I merely wanted age of account to be tracked, not filtered. As others here mentioned, sockpuppeting is a bit more advanced than making fresh throwaway accounts these days. We'll need to take a closer look at the most suspicious accounts to see if we can establish a pattern, or at least measure the proportion of comments related to the topic within the chosen timeframe.
3. Scoring comments by "1" or "20" filters out way too much. In the end, a list of relevant threads will need to be identified, with manual designation of comments as "pro" or "con" to the block size change. For example, there are many filler comments along the lines of "Let's just do this already, how bad could it be?!".
4. While I have no expectation Reddit mods or admins can/will help, we'll also need to compose an actionable request to them for anonymized stats on multiple accounts using single IPs, vote spamming, etc.
If you want to continue work with the group, please send me a private message and I'll loop you in. The next step is for me to add some of the feedback to the spec and probably set up a Skype call, or Teampspeak gathering, or text chat to coordinate and divvy up tasks.
It's possible this will be much more manual work than I hoped, but we've got some smart and willing people on board, and maybe we can minimize the work by identifying new keywords or patterns that can be automatically sorted or filtered.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:40:51
Yes, generally that's the idea. Still trying to sync up with my data audit guy and he now has some feedback about the methods so far.
Note that I only have control over the 5btc I offered, and it will be up to the BitGo guy as to how/whether he distributes his matching 5btc offer. I tried to get input from him on the process but he never responded...
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:01:41
There was a guy who used to clone the bitcointalk.org forum to prevent deleted posts from being lost. Would be pretty awesome to have that for this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:59:21
I get the impression the BitGo portion is also interested in submitting the info to Reddit for potential action.
I am not convinced, by the way. I am worried.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:06:20
I will discuss approach and keywords with the researcher that takes the job. But, generally, the 20mb posts are disproportionately more frequent, in my own observations.
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:55:11
Been busy, sorry, I'll sort out payouts this week. If anyone that has done work sends me the BTC address via pm it'll make things easier as well.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:14:13
because scores were ever worth something?
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:48:31
I am working on a rough spec and will brainstorm with the interested researchers to flesh that out. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:27:43
I'm not interested in the Yes/No poll, or any other poll, in this research.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:53:32
If you start equivocating where all money would be better spent you'll go insane.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:03:16
I'm not a scientist of any sort. I'll let the researchers word the final hypothesis for me, so as to avoid obnoxious nitpicking from any reddit backseat scientists.
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:14:32
People (that hold Bitcoins) assume Bitcoin is a safe haven for money when other markets/economies pop.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:04:19
That's probably better described as censorship, not manipulation or astroturfing.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:35:55
Raise the fees dynamically with the size, if you must. Remove any possibility of real estate being discounted or inflated.
@_date: 2015-06-14 12:10:02
People investing in the Blockchain downplay the currency because they are still trying to mop up all the coins. They don't want another bubble to happen prematurely.
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:16:34
Just click and listen, geez... Live a little.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:36:59
Bounty will be paid regardless of result, but I do want to make sure specific criteria is researched at a minimum. The data is not useful if it doesn't contrast both sides anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:39:17
I have nothing to gain by doing this research. Not even sure anyone could...
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:37:06
C'mon now, bitlicense is totally irrelevant to this conversation, don't prance in here dropping trendy keywords and think they can pass as discourse.
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:06:33
Zero-fee would promote wash trading, but wash trading wouldn't result in what you are seeing. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:04:19
I'm not gonna be the guy to try and kill astroturfing, just trying to show it exists in this context.
@_date: 2015-06-14 11:37:59
Did this work happen to have a list of all relevant thread URLs to "block size" as a byproduct? Also, (not now), but if we get to another data set, can you provide in csv format instead? This raw doesn't quite parse well. I'm trying to sync up with the guy I want to verify your data, but he's been out of town til today, so hopefully that will happen sooner than later now.
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:12:55
Because running a fractional reserve is totally difficult? Nah. Look at banks, look at Gox, etc.
I'm not the first person to think Huobi, OKCoin, and BTCChine fake most of their spot volume, it's not much of stretch to think they do it with intention to manipulate price as well. 
We also have accusations from former employees that OKCoin trades against its customers and are able to "top up" at will.
@_date: 2015-12-01 15:38:26
Who cares?
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:44:48
The network would accommodate them just fine. Most of them are just sitting on the coins anyway... Remember tx fees already have function to throttle and prioritize tx's. That function works only because of the scarcity of the block size. If you remove scarcity, you inject an inflation mechanism into the system.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:42:51
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:44:33
How is this proving a negative? I am looking for evidence, proof would be nice, but I won't get my hopes that high.
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:03:57
Adoption is something Capitalism wants, Bitcoin doesn't need economic ideals baked in.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:58:56
Welcome to the suspect list! jk...maybe
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:58:00
 any feedback on specs for the study is welcome
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:36:01
This has more to do with what people may want reddit to think, than what reddit actually thinks. I believe there is a shadow campaign and would like to find evidence. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 10:51:04
Yes, we all sold a long time ago, what are you waiting for?
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:55:06
Been busy, sorry, I'll sort out payouts this week. If anyone that has done work sends me the BTC address via pm it'll make things easier as well.
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:57:09
I had a friend working on verifying the data independently. That work is done and now I need to review. 
Payouts coming this week to anyone that put work in. PM me your BTC address. 
NOTE: I do not control the 5btc offered by BitGo, oonly my own 5btc. You'll need to harass them directly if you want payout/more work.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:58:47
The research will not be into "why", it's to search for evidence of "whether".
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:11:10
Go ahead and throw your weight around, Gavin. You'll learn how much weight you actually carry.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:21:08
Well, we were discussing block size as supply, and you pivoted to an abstract notion of our working free market. Frankly, it was non-content, and you didn't even answer my call for relevance.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:13:08
Adoption and block size aren't even close to being correlated. 
If people want higher quality of service from the blockchain, they can pay a higher fee, but they can never pay a high enough fee to be faster than Mastercard.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:27:41
This is related to my argument in the op. You've got the flow backwards. People will not come to Bitcoin because block size is larger, they don't even know that exists as a factor. At best, you're arguing for retention of adopters, not increase.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:56:24
I have no problem with escrow we can mutually agree upon. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:39:05
Block size is a consensus-determined protocol parameter, nothing central about it at all.
Elastic supply is a functionally infinite supply. Infinite supply is a recipe for disaster in value.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:52:02
By your logic, why study anything at all? Only if it might be illegal? You don't have to care, I do.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:24:14
There is enough data in the public info to get somewhere.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:54:10
gj, get all the greeks to buy the top. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:22:39
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:37:06
We can't assume that they'd be assed to help, but I will make sure they are at least asked as part of the process.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:26:24
You are only helping me make my case. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:56:09
All will be shared, including if the outcome shows there's no reason to be concerned.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:21:31
No. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:49:11
If the limit is always increased to be higher than the demand (the intent of this change), then it functions no different than infinite supply.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:44:10
What you all seem to miss is that we don't need to change anything at all, and at the very least there is no imminent rush. There ARE many fleshed out arguments against this change. Everything about your comment shows you are not qualified to comment on this situation.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:02:23
Grow up.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:25:59
I think a narrative has been constructed to support a nonexistent "problem" in order to allow a faulty design into the protocol. I believe Gavin &amp; Mike have been compromised or, at best, have some sort of ego delusion that their ideas for Bitcoin should be projected onto everyone.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:56:31
Just say so publicly and we can arrange escrow or something once I give someone the job.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:58:20
Odd you went with iOS first...
@_date: 2015-06-17 10:10:59
If the size is dynamic it is functionally infinite, so, NO.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:41:23
My motivation is to promote critical thinking, skepticism, and perspective within Bitcoin discourse.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:05:29
My motive is to separate respect from idolatry.
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:44:43
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:21:24
Megaphones are real TA. However, they are making some leaps to present this as one.
I could argue that the price has actually already cleared the megaphone range into a new range: 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:58:39
This situation is proof you are incorrect. If it were that easy, there wouldn't even be public discourse on block size.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:01:22
I like how you quote my first comment then ignore it immediately afterwards.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:39:15
Thanks Theymos, this is the difference between a Bitcoiner and the scammers pushing other stuff.
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:24:37
I get frustrated with all of the armchair "but what if..." how-many-transactions-can-we-fit-in-a-block arguments.
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:44:48
Oh, just shut up for now, save your bullshit for criticizing the results.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:38:58
Circle is the same as Coinbase, people just haven't noticed yet.
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:33:10
I also have endless hours of experience watching inexplicable volume behavior on Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:10:11
Exactly, you don't get faster tx without lesser security. Hence my concern that is Gavin's true goal, lesser security, since I know he is smart enough to understand this tradeoff.
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:25:28
Moe Levin.
@_date: 2015-06-08 12:55:20
Um, what is Magic?
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:43:51
You're the last person I thought would defend Coinbase...
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:42:51
Such irony.
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:09:02
Really, no one cares about any of this but the people bickering.
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:58:44
While I encourage keeping bitcoin exchanges honest thru criticism, this one is stupid. The date dynamically updates based on qty being purchased. Now you know, and have no excuse for fucking up next time.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:55:14
That is a pivot in your argument and not contextual to our prior comments. It's also odd for you and Gavin to use the success of the way things are as an argument for change. Last I checked, transactions sent without fees still get processed anyway...
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:38:18
I am not an academic, and I don't mind if the research proves my hunch to be wrong. I just want information.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:06:42
Even as an avid Bitcoiner since 2012, I can't stand waiting for qt to sync. It's so fucking obnoxious how long it takes that I wonder if Gavin &amp; Mike did something to make so slow on purpose.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:37:59
Well, I do think the results of that poll are way too skewed. It's just got nothing to do with this bounty as a data point.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:02:41
Your coins aren't affected by a fork unless you send them during the forking. Simply put, your coins now exist on both forks.
(This is the phase where the snakes frame the argument as if they already won, and the post-blocksize-fork world is made to seem inevitable. There will be no fork, don't worry.)
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:50:40
Coinbase never really acted on community interests or feedback.

Yes, as long as the data points I want researched are included at minimum. However, the research is not merely about whether trusted people post a lot on either side of the topic, it's whether some or most of the the identities match data points that would classify them as possible socks, compromised accounts, etc. It's about analyzing behavior.
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:39:25
Please provide references that support your argument. 
Even if you can, there's simply no way to know whether Bitcoin can become a "primary currency". I don't think it's possible any time soon, that's for sure.
I also disagree. Loans would still be just as profitable, they'd just be designed differently (no interest, negative interest, attached to volatility instruments, etc).
The problem I have with everyone's vision for a deflationary "primary currency" is that it presumes the value can just keep going up. It's absurd.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:19:52
That's why Bitcoin is awesome, and why decentralization is a design choice of safety and security, not speed and convenience. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:12:24
Am argument could be made the houses would become relatively much more expensive in a deflationary currency paradigm. Land is deflationary too y'know ;)
An argument could also be made that people could behave the opposite of how people predict, in that they'd be no more reluctant to spend than now. See my other posts in this thread for more details.

The blockchain does NOT work "equally well" at lower prices. Bitcoin's liquidity is not infinite, nor is the amount of USD invested in it. 
Better liquidity allows for larger transactions. 
It could also allow for cheaper transactions, since the cost of dealing with volatility goes down as well. This applies to both mining fees and centralized service providers like BitPay.
Higher value supports higher security of the network, incentive for miners to process transactions.
People that try to decouple Bitcoin the currency from Bitcoin the "technology" are either mistakenly or willfully spreading false info. That's the kind of argument you'll hear from haters, competitors, and the ignorant.

Garbage article doesn't let me comment so I'll do so here. 
Please pay attention.
I know some of you joke (and now Time teases) that this or that "is actually good for bitcoin", but the reason it's funny is because it's true. Bitcoin is what's called antifragile, which means that attacks make it stronger, it can thrive on randomness. This is reflected in its nature and price volatility.
The reason why it sounds like a joke is because what's good for bitcoin isn't always good for the price, but make no mistake, everything *is* good for bitcoin.
Detractors can laugh, attack, ban, track, subvert, and each attempt will simply cause bitcoin to evolve beyond it.
Bitcoin's slogan should be "Come at me , bro."

Absolute nonsense. 
Yes, I can agree that the value of BTC in fiat plays a role in a miner's desire to participate, but every other notion you mention is absurd really.
There's no situation where a scrypt hardfork would be an answer to fight miners. Don't pretend like altcoin miners would somehow save the day if bitcoin miners didnt adopt a hard fork. 
Your premise of the "old fork" being the one that has no value is also insane. It is the NEW fork that would have zero value UNTIL it had the support of miners.
Bitcoin gets its value from the robustness of its network, the hard fork proposal is a direct attack on that.
You really do have it all backwards.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:07:02
The only way to "hold" btc in a decentralized way is on the blockchain, which processes blocks at about 1 every 10 minutes, often 60min.
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:50:06
First, it is not "widely viewed as good for bitcoin" it is merely a select few trying to make it look that way with planted threads like this.
Second, miners "widely view" higher fees as an inevitable thing, and if BTC price goes up in fiat value, lower fees become acceptable again, it's a dynamic balancing act that happens to be designed well enough to push and pull on its own, without a fork.
Miners all agreeing to reject a fork is not an attack. The fork is the attack. 
You are basically stating the opposite of how things pan out to argue your case, are you Tea Party or something?


I don't know any way to state this other than that your comments are patently false. There is no design within bitcoin that gives votes to any kind of economic majority. Miners run the show and when shit hits the fan they are the ones implementing the save.

Because it's an impossible scenario, the size of the current bitcoin mining network and the value it brings simply casts a shadow that altcoiners could only dream of shining under. In a hard fork scenario the value would plummet for everyone involved, there would be no $7500. Your scenario would be absolute chaos and everyone would flee from it.


I'm saying that without the miners, no value can be maintained. You have this notion that miners are a trivial concern. Again you have it backwards, the only reason bitcoin is worth more than altcoins is the amount of network security and reliability the bitcoin miners provide, which is what allows the economic activity to safely happen at all.
Proof of work, it's a thing. Being under a constant threat of 51% attack is what makes alts worth less, and is what you are suggesting for bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-12-14 05:00:25
Looks like you're the only one remotely answering the question! The op frames this from a fiat/inflationary paradigm.
The thing is, a house has its own dynamic value, and if your Bitcoins go up in USD value, it does not automatically translate into your Bitcoins allowing you to purchase "more" house(s).
If we ever really did conversion to a deflationary financial system, (I'm not sure if we'll really ever see that happen, particularly in our lifetime), I imagine there would be a sort of tipping point. This tipping point would probably include hyperinflation of fiats, but more importantly a total shift in how people save, spend, and design financial instruments. 
A house is worth what it is worth in the marketplace of humans wanting houses, this means their value can still go up in a deflationary setup. 
Deflation doesn't automatically imply increased buying power. What if humans stop reproducing so much, or stop adding any value to society in some notable portion? 
A money itself can become less valuable as well. Maybe people figure some new way of bartering more easily, assigning value to objects or actions in some other way? 
I guess the simplest thing to remember is that everything about assigning value is dynamic and fleeting. 
Dad: "Do you know what this baseball card worth?"
Son: "The price guide says $40, so $40."
Dad: "No, it's worth whatever you can sell it for."

The TLDR is literally "If the block size limit is not increased, we will see more off-chain solutions. But they won’t be the Lightning Network– instead, we will see highly centralized “clearing” agreements between exchanges and miners and merchants or merging of miners and transactions creators."
That's funny considering Coinbase is on the wrong side of that argument. Exchanges are already working to use the Liquid sidechain.
How does a bigger block remove that incentive for centralized players to cooperate? It does not.

You might be limiting your data set arbitrarily. Aren't you really just researching latency? Is it master's work to choose a few loosely associated networks and measure them?-
The more centralized, or simple, the system is, the faster it can be; the more decentralized, or complicated, the system is, the more secure it can be. Thesis complete, no?!
It might be interesting to focus on identifying external factors to the networks that can affect network quality and measure those (distance, node relays, ddos, location, firewall of china, I dunno!).
I'm just thinking out loud here, don't feel obligated to care about my opinion at all!

Exactly. 
Sure, it would be nice to have evidence of intent to defraud, but my point is that, functionally, you don't need that degree of confirmation to know to stay away. 
When it comes to things like this, sometimes it's just incompetence and greed, rather than a conscious attempt to defraud investors anyway.

I don't have a problem with anyone writing any code for Bitcoin. While we have evidence of that from BitPay, it's not yet certain that we can say they are "preparing to release a fork", which implies they are campaigning.

@_date: 2016-03-01 16:21:22
The thing is Bruce TOLD them things would be private, they didn't necessarily ask. Also, in the transcript every person is anonymized as a number. 
Some are claiming Chatham House Rule. 
Regardless, Bruce could ask attendees if they care to release it, it's not like he isn't in communication with them, or that there are too many people to track.
And yes, I do personally object to transcripts being private in this case.

How do you guys not see this is all a total waste of time? All these attempts at consensus politicking are attempts to compromise Bitcoin and the current values of the people who are not trying to influence a fork or such.

Happy to explain!
Not every player was present, including some core devs, many mining players, etc. Bitcoin is an open cooperative effort, and secret planning and negotiation is representative of centralization and, quite literally, privatization. 
The meeting was agreed to be under Chatham House rule, thus the information can be used if anonymized.
If people want to be secretive, they could do a lot better than broadcasting their meeting across social media, and flaunting it like some sort of bitcoin elite Bilderberg session...

I agree that the best thing would be for CoinDesk to reimburse, however they have no ability to confirm who lost what. They do have SOME ability, but realizing claims wouldn't be simple.
They may also prefer to stay away from the matter further due to legal concerns, so people that lost may need to lawyer up, etc.
Overall shitty for everyone.
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:23:06
I disagree. Instagram is indeed critically dependent on tech, but it's got a lot of UIX to help the user and hide it. Bitcoin services do the same thing.
Bitcoiners like to think of themselves as special, but the fact is that hookers and drug dealers use it just fine, so, so can you.
The Bitcoiners that actually know what they are talking about are few.

C'mon man. You knew the bounty was paid and did the work anyway. I do think you have a good case for making Mike pay up though, and I sincerely wish you luck with that.
This is why I don't reddit, it's nothing but drama...
@_date: 2016-12-17 00:21:49
I know I did what I said I would. I paid out 5btc and I went through steps to get there. Unfortunately Reddit strips timestamps from old messages, else I'd get nitty gritty with you.
Sorry you missed the boat, go get on Mike's.

Maybe you were thinking of or talking to Mike Belshe, from BitGo? He had ante'd up an additional 5btc for the bounty, and I'm pretty sure he never paid out like I did. 
Go after him for it.

I communicated completely publicly about how to get the bounty, and how to reach me. I also gave warning that I was gonna pay out the two people that worked on it evenly before I did it. If you weren't one of those people, and still did the work without communicating with me, I'm sorry, but that's not my fault.

@_date: 2015-07-19 13:41:34
Basically, I was getting annoyed by a lot of useless supportive comments popping up on every debate thread, so much so that I became suspicious. 
Partly, this is me expecting too much from reddites, that they won't just blindly follow the trend. Partly, I do think some socks were used.
As you mentioned, the idea was to identify suspects, look into their account behaviors, etc. But by the time the data came out I mostly just lost interest. Were there a kernel of obvious socking behavior, I may have dug deeper. But I just don't care enough about reddit posters (and whether they have any intention to sway the debate) anymore.
In the end, reddit has absolutely no influence on the decision of block size, and crowds are generally horrible at making progessive decisions anyway.
I am indeed against the blocksize change for the most part, and this is because, fundamentally, a system can't be both robust from a security standpoint, and efficient and fast from a tx standpoint at the same time. The qualities are antipodal.
I also reject any dynamic blocksize solutions that are measured by any aspect of the system miners can control. As in, don't make size relative to difficulty, hashpower, % of block size utilized, etc etc. In general, it's hard to make a dynamic size that isn't functionally infinite over time.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:42:42

Relax, I was testing the site for them this morning a bit, and decided to post a few referral links. Partially to see how reddit users &amp; mods responded, as well as to see how the dashboard worked for affiliates. 
I then worked with one of the sellers to provide feedback to the site owners on everything.

Compromise and consensus are incompatible. Also, this isn't even a compromise, it's suggesting Core concede. A compromise would be something like S2X establishing tx throughput and tx fee goals and agreeing to wait to fork until needed.

I stopped asking this a while ago, I don't think anyone really knows whether Bitcoin has flaws. Some flaws have shown themselves in the past, some have been revealed via altcoins. Look for the story about how someone figured out that when mining rewards run out, they actually reset to the original 50btc reward again.
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:23:13

That logic is so backwards. Miners are out there mining empty blocks because the fees are already not worth the risk of losing out on the block reward. If you increase the size of blocks, that will put downward pressure on the fee size further. 
Miners can only make more money off of bigger blocks if the network is constantly at full capacity, and every tx has a fee large enough to offset the decreased value of blockspace.
I don't know what the optimal blocksize is, but it is probably dynamic and something that should not be able to be influenced by miners or spammers.

You are selectively ignoring the other condition in that sentence, "users stop using Bitcoin", "income". Of course market price affects miner income, it's part of the equation.
However your example is also irrelevant. You seem to imply that hashrate increased because market price went down, which is obviously absurd. Hashrate going up is a power play investment by miners. That too is a way to support market price, albeit much more risky than just buying coins, hence why I believe it is at least partially a power play.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:31:37
lol, thx. You have been blocked with RES plugin.
@_date: 2015-11-15 08:47:01
Pshh, don't quote me if you're gonna fuck up the grammar!
It's pretty simple, and explained in the prior parts of the same sentence. You either make it so vulnerable it's worthless, or inflate the blocks so much there is no need to pay fees. 
They are both the same quality really. Attacking Bitcoin becomes much easier when you have a way bloat it, even if such an attack isn't realized until fees become the main source of income for miners.
Expanding block size will lead to the need to adjust other parameters to mitigate the problems added. Over time, it will look more and more like how a central bank tweaks knobs to try and achieve "health". *OMG no one is paying fees? Well, let's force them! How much? How about we double it every 3 years? Fees are too high? OMG let's mitigate that with a parameter change.* Bleh.
In my eyes, this is all going down the wrong path, particularly when you consider that none of the popular proposals have a method for determining their chosen block size, nor do they propose dynamic block sizes, miners are still mining empty blocks, decentralization issues are being glossed over, node count is not incentivized, etc.
I just don't see the need to tweak the blocksize until someone can come up with a proper method of identifying what network factors should instigate a size change, that those changes be dynamic, and that they not act as functionally infinite (block cap never able to be hit). 
Honestly, I'm much more interested in concepts like node incentivization, decreased block time/size &amp; unbundling of tx from blocks (smaller, faster blocks), checking and readjusting mining difficulty more dynamically/frequently, anonymization of tx/wallets, etc, etc. 
It's insulting to us all that we accept block size increase as the "issue" of the day when the only people that openly want it are centralized powers (Bitpay, Coinbase, etc), a handful of egomaniacal devs, and the social media fans and sock puppets of the aforementioned. 
It's made even more ridiculous when you consider that there are alternatives like sidechains &amp; lightning network under development, and centralized layers that people like Coinbase could employ to relieve bottlenecks to their customers anyway (like how banks and credit card networks are experimenting with blockchains).
This of course leads me to believe the only logical reason such a change would be promoted so heavily is a malicious one, with the enemy either wanting the opportunity to exploit the hard fork in process, or to exploit the newly compromised network after the block size has increased.

Not False, consider that for Bitcoin's entire life, fees have never had to be high enough to pay for mining costs. As I noted, fees are currently at an inconsequential value as is, and you want to devalue them even further by increasing blocksize.
The point here is that any inflation within the protocol ends up inflating Bitcoin itself without increasing the coin count. I don't think it's bad to theorize about what might be the best way to determine optimal block size, but I think it's dangerous to the point of being malicious to arbitrarily change that size without actual necessity. It's even worse to have a rolling size increase like Gavin wants. 
The fact that all these size change suggestions are choosing arbitrarily tells me these actors are either malicious or so shortsighted we shouldn't do anything they say.

Bitcoin is not a network of inclusion. Scarcity if space is tied to Bitcoin's value. Inflating blocksize is just an indirect way of inflating Bitcoin without adding new coins to it.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:49:10
Security is managed by hashpower and decentralization of that hashpower. Hashpower is a product of reward value (fees and block rewards). 
The only reason to increase block size is if fees become become so high that users won't pay them. The thing is, that can't actually happen because once users stop using Bitcoin, the fee income drops and hashpower decreases, decreasing costs for remaining miners.
The balancing system is already an elegant design and sufficient, what's missing is an improved way to keep hashpower decentralized. Increasing blocksize makes that even worse. 
The best solution I know of, is to incentivize nodes somehow, thus making it easier to avoid centralization.

I read that paper when it was released and immediately recall this: "Note that as we consider only a subset of possible metrics (due to difficulty in accurately measuring others), our results on reparametrization may be viewed as upper bounds: additional metrics could reveal even stricter limits."
Basically, they did not measure exactly how 2MB-4MB blocks might affect decentralization, they did not recommend any specific size for blocks outside of noting that their lowest sizes should probably be treated as upper bounds (at best), and offered no conclusive reason to assume larger blocks would be harmless to decentralization or even whether it solved any actual problems.
The problem is that 2MB blocks would likely fill the same week they were released, because there is no minimum fee or way to throttle 'spam'(i know there is no difference between spam or normal tx, other than the fee they are willing to pay). Sure, sometimes some people would get a 'legitimate' transaction thru sooner, but generally the effect on 'spam' filtering would go unmitigated, and this would all be at the price of further centralization. 
Frankly, the paper is not enough research to justify the change.

"While an increase in resource requirements for a node will discourage more nodes, an increase in throughput will accommodate more adoption, which will encourage more nodes."
This implies that throughput is curbing adoption. Is there any evidence of this? And if there is, is it enough evidence to confidently determine what the method for choosing a blocksize should be? 
Or, do you wanna just pick a size arbitrarily and pray that for some reason people come running to use it?
How does wider adoption encourage more nodes? Nodes aren't even incentivized.

They are more similar than "early adopters get rich". The more money put in, the more money can be taken out by founders. The more founders take out, the less everyone leftover can take out.
A "bank run" in Bitcoin would leave a lot of people with worthless Bitcoins. 
Many promoters of Bitcoin have the same core desire as a Ponzi artist, to find people to hold their bag.
Don't get all high n mighty about it. It's a lot like a Ponzi, but that's okay, because it's the best Ponzi we've got. Don't even get me started on them fiat scams...

Please understand that larger blocks would mean each tx fee would be less expensive than if the blocks were smaller. 
Larger blocks make attacks easier, not harder. You have it exactly backwards and thus you are either misinformed, or spreading misinformation.
The following sentences in your comment also lead me to believe you are spreading misinformation, so I will add you to my list of untrusted commenters.

Not really, they just need counterparty options. Hedge funds, etc, are drooling over getting coins in bulk from miners anyway.

There are no KYC costs for nodes, there is no KYC necessary in Bitcoin network. Any effort to add KYC to the network will devalue it, this includes red/blacklisting and any friction to fungibility.

The block limit was meant to be hit, not an unreachable moving target. A block limit that is unreachable and inflationary would either create an achievable attack surface, or eventually cause inflation of the currency's fundamentals, and thus trend its value to zero.

No, it was their consistent attempts to compromise bitcoin's code and distort the public's perspective on concepts.
@_date: 2015-11-14 12:14:02
I'm saying the only people that would find that argument persuasive are Bitcoin Companies. People project their own vision of what it takes for Bitcoin to "succeed", but Bitcoin doesn't give a shit. 
All it needs is to be is decentralized and secure. If other features can be implemented without compromising that, great.

He's trying to create a narrative that block size must change and that people are scared. The only ones scared are him and his evil overlords.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:50:36
Security is managed by hashpower and decentralization of that hashpower. Hashpower is a product of reward value (fees and block rewards).
The only reason to increase block size is if fees become become so high that users won't pay them. The thing is, that can't actually happen because once users stop using Bitcoin, the fee income drops and hashpower decreases, decreasing costs for remaining miners.
The balancing system is already an elegant design and sufficient, what's missing is an improved way to keep hashpower decentralized. Increasing blocksize makes that even worse.
The best solution I know of, is to incentivize nodes somehow, thus making it easier to avoid decentralization.

SOunds like a bunch of gibberish to me, tbh. This just goes back to people projecting "problems" and "needs" onto Bitcoin. There is no "onboarding" or "runway". Just make sure Bitcoin exists for people when they want to go to it.

This is the narrative you wish to convey, I know. But there will be no fork, there is no consensus, and we don't "need" to "compromise".

To the commenters against you: 
The point is to avoid, mitigate, and eradicate all aspects of the protocol that allow any trend of centralization. The reason is that any increasing trend will eventually result in too much centralization, which totally defeats the point of Bitcoin.
It's simply how all organized systems die, success begets centralization, centralization eventually fails, and we start over from scratch again.
To ask things like "how much de/centralization is enough/too much?" is to improperly phrase the question. 
Do not project your desires for Bitcoin (and more likely your greed) as things Bitcoin "needs". Bitcoin does not "need" to do anything but survive. It does not "need" mass adoption, the masses need Bitcoin.

Those are exactly the things I mentioned... :/

1. You misunderstand how mining advantages work I think. Being that China represents more hashpower than the West, they are actually the benefactors of latency issues.
2. Another misunderstanding - It's easy to fill blocks now, "testers" do it regularly. More importantly, 2MB blocks are not inherently more expensive to fill. Picture a bus that allows homeless people to fill up unsold seats. Making the bus bigger does not bring more paying customers, nor does it reduce the number of homeless people wanting a free ride.
