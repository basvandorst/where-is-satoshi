i think bitcoin will always go up and not down because it has a blockchain and the usd does not.
think about it.
people say sell bitcoin sometimes, but they say buy bitcoin more.  and they never say "buy us dollar"

is there a way to mark the coins so that nobody sells them on an exchange?  this is a smart idea and i think most miners would know to reject that transaction.
