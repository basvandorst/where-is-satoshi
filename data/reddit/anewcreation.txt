... said everyone when Bitcoin was at $1100.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:55:34
Wow, how much Bitcoin did you own?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:37:50
Well do you think it will go up? I can't tell you how high or low it will go. If you think it's a sound investment go for it. If you're just throwing money at Bitcoin to see if you make money, I'd keep it. That's how people get burned.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:06:29
Ah, right on. Sorry, man.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:47:47
Whatever it is, it will probably start a panic.

You don't need proof of residency to buy or sell on Coinbase. It is a fixed rate exchange though - not a full market like MtGox.

He IS a fraud. I guess we could use a different word besides fraud... how about... completely wrong in everything he says? The whole Keynesian view of the economy is wrong. He's wrong on how the economy grows. He's wrong on how government spending affects economic growth. Pretty much everything else. We've had a half a century of Keynesian policy and look at where it has gotten us.

Not to rain on your parade but there is no way Apple will accept Bitcoin in the near future. Let's focus on small shops and retailers then work our way up to Apple.

Hayek wasn't talking about saving of the money supply as in hoarding. He was talking about saving money in a bank account or lending money out to borrowers so it grows the economy. Hayek doesn't think keeping money in your wallet is helping the economy grow but rather lending money to those who can use it more effectively than you does. I think you're mixing two different things here.

HAHAHA Occupy??? Worst political movement in the history of mankind. The only thing they were right about was the Federal Reserve. Otherwise they're basically saying, "take from them and give to us!" They are the antithesis of free market advocates.

What happens when the whole economy halts and we lose power and other basic utilities? Your Bitcoin is worthless and unable to be used in exchange. Buy gold and silver.

Why does Wall Street own Washington? Because they have power that Wall Street doesn't have. They have a monopoly on the use of force. Take away the power that the State has and Wall Street has nothing to buy!

So.. now resistance at 500?

Uh, what? This says we don't currently have a named monetary system? The graph cuts off at 1920. Let's fix this chart.
* Pre 1913: pure gold standard
* 1913 - 1945: gold-exchange standard
* 1945-1971: Bretton Woods system
* 1971-now: dollar exchange standard
Either way you cut it, a new monetary system is coming. They only last for 30-40 years.

Nothing is free. Someone paid your bill.
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:06:57
Basically all other world currencies are backed by the dollar and the dollar is backed by absolutely nothing (since we went off the gold standard). Bretton Woods was where every currency was backed by the dollar and the dollar was backed by gold. That ended with Nixon in 1971.

HA! John Maynard Keynes. Only the greatest fraud in the history of economics. I agree with you that it is a bubble, though. Read some Ludwig von Mises. Get that Keynesian crap out of your brain!

On [the ticker]( the sell off from 580 to 513 just keeps on repeating over and over... something is going down.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:07:26
I think the initial sell of was people thinking that they have made enough and just want to get out. Probably thinking "this isn't going to go up forever, better get out now while the price is high." After the initial sell off, panic probably started to set in for those who bought in around $600 or $700 because they wanted to recoup their initial investment.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:54:23
The first crash last night went down to 600 then it was stable around 700. Look where we are now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:53:16
As long as the price fluctuates from nearly $900 to $600 in one 12 hour span, they will never accept it. Bitcoin must become stable (like every other currency) for retailers to accept it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:20:36
Haha, Keynes? How is saying Bitcoin won't work something Keynes would say?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:44:45
How do you know the upward price isn't motivated by emotion?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:06:06
It makes perfect sense because people are only buying on speculation (thinking that they will be able to resell it for a greater value in the future). Bitcoin has no demand as a commodity. It doesn't have intrinsic value. It can't be used in a production process. It's all smoke and mirrors. Sure some people will become very wealthy, but others will lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:18:26
Honestly, I would wait till this thing bottoms out. I don't think it has yet.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:34:39
Coinbase is really slow... I can't sell off..
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:39:36
Oh, it's down alright...
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:37:18
Same, bro. Good ol' fashion bank run!
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:27:45
Oh, I have. One guy offered me bread. My point is, Occupy protests the wrong thing. They shouldn't be protesting Wall Street, they should be protesting the White House and on Capitol Hill!
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:38:09
Where do you buy them?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:09:26
Yeah, interest saying "the price will be $1000 tomorrow so I better buy now!" Let's be real, that's the true reason why people are buying. They aren't buying it so they can use it as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:33:42
Trolololo... haha. I enjoyed this.
