I hate to be that guy, but this email doesn't make sense.
Overstock accepts bitcoins and immediately converts them to dollars. Vendors on Overstock.com would never see a single bitcoin, even if their products were being purchased with bitcoins. I don't even know if they would be made aware that a purchase was made in bitcoins.

A "Bucket shop" is kinda a blanket term that covers a lot of different kinds of fraudulent behavior...
Let's have a thought experiment. You are the guy in charge of Mt Gox, and you are a devious fellow that intends to steal money from the bitcoin community, how would you do it?
You can't take someone's money/bitcoin without giving them what they purchased, otherwise that would raise a lot of red flags, and your trust would be gone, so please limit your diabolic scheme to something that gives the customers the thing they are buying.

Yes, I could give you a random social security number and it would be totally useless, but if I told you it was Bob's social security number, it might mean something.
If you know Bob's address, then you know all of Bob's transactions, unless bob regularly changes his address, then you only know a portion of his transactions.

That post was an April 1st post. It was deleted right after it was posted. (I tried reading it 10 minutes after it appeared in my RSS feed) I think someone at TC thought it would be a great April Fools joke, but got cold feet.

This is the real problem. The infrastructure required to host an exchange is the hard part, the actual software is pretty trivial compared. Transferring bitcoins is cheap, but transferring dollars and other currencies isn't so easy.
I shudder to think what would happen if everyone and their brother thought they could run an exchange. Even if every single attempt was truly legitimate and honest, the likelihood of losses is great.

Software and hardware are not the expensive parts...

The "value" of the processing power can only be realized if it were used for something other than "proof of work" calculations. With the advent of ASICs, much of the petaflops of processing power is specialized equipment that isn't actually useful for anything other than SHA256 hashing, thus has very limited use. Those petaflops of processing power have no "value" outside of this application.
It could be argued that the value of bitcoins is backed by the cost of the equipment performing those 600 petaflops. The owners of the hardware have a vested interest in the value of the currency, thus would want to maintain or increase it's value.
Still, much of the equipment has a value outside of this specific scope of operation. Most of the FPGAs and GPUs performing these calculations have a "value" that exists independently of the bitcoin. They could be sold on any other market for similar prices, so those parts don't really back the value of the bitcoin.
The specialized stuff, the stuff that is only good for bitcoins, that is a legitimate "value" that is behind the bitcoin. The equipment is effectively worthless outside of this application, thus their only "value" depends on the "value" of bitcoins.
Let's entertain the idea that 600 petaflops backs the bitcoin, that would mean that 1 teraflop is worth around $4128 right now (based on market cap). A 7970 has around 3.8 teraflops of processing power. That would mean that a 7970 is worth around $15,000 based on its computational power. A 7970 is worth around $400 USD.
If Bitcoins were actually based on the amount of processing power backing the network, market cap would be ~$63 million (if every bit of processing power was AMD 7970 GPUs). The market cap would be even less if you performed these calculations using FPGAs or ASICs as your reference piece.
I am not arguing that bitcoins have no value, I am simply arguing that your assertion is wrong. The value of bitcoins is not connected to the value of the equipment used to perform the calculations necessary to maintain the network.

The "work" involved in bitcoin mining is not useful. Bitcoin mining only cares about the "proof of work"
SHA256 hashing is a computationally expensive random number generator. There is a lottery number out there, and the person who picks it using the random number generator wins.
Difficulty is designed to make the chances of winning the lottery easier or more difficult. Ideally, someone should win the lottery every 10 minutes. If it happens more frequently, difficulty goes up, if it happens less frequently difficulty goes down.
Every time you run the hash and it doesn't "win", the work gets discarded.

I don't think that would be viable... Maybe bitcoin could be transferred to the provider first, then fiat, then to the end user. It would at least give the provider the opportunity to roll back the transaction and return the btc to the rightful owner if the fiat transfer failed.

There is no actual relationship between bitcoins and any other crypto-currencies. Their values are (mostly) unrelated. The only relationship their values have involves the trust people place in crypto-currencies.

Speaking to the manager will not be effective, as they are not able to create policy. McDonalds restaurants operate under a franchise, affiliate, or corporate model.
McDonalds Franchises and Affiliates are governed by their franchise agreements with McDonalds the Corporation. It is not up to them what they can and cannot do, you will need to speak to Corporate if you wish to enact any change.

I would think it is appropriate to let the provider who is incurring the risk be the one to handle the situation.
Escrow is a necessary element for this to work. Sure, you can try to define and track trust, but an error could leave a provider burning their customer, or eating a raw transaction. Providers are going to be more trustworthy, because they are accountable to their banking/credit provider. A provider who burns their bridges isn't going to be able to provide much. Providers are putting real identities on the line. A user can just hop addresses and rebuild their reputation, and move to a new provider.

This is an utterly worthless move.

There is no need for a company to use a crypto-currency, if it is used entirely internally.
If Amazon wants a digital currency, they can just create them out of thin air, sell them, and accept them as payment.
Bitcoins exist because I don't trust you, and you don't trust me, but we need some way to trust each other, so we get everyone else to keep us honest.
Amazon has no reason to not trust itself. They can easily verify that I have X number of "Amazon Currency" in my account, they can easily verify that I sent X number of "Amazon Currency" to another Amazon customer, and they can easily verify that the other customer traded X number of "Amazon Currency" for a half dozen e-books.

I think that btc as a currency could succeed if people stop treating it like a commodity.
There isn't money to be made off of currencies, and they are pretty boring. How many subreddits are devoted to the dollar, yen, or euro (there is a euro subreddit, but its about the region, not the currency).
So, once people can't make money off of btc, it might have a chance at success.

You can still transfer your funds out of mt gox. In this scenario, the exchange would be unable to give you your funds.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:44:53
Yes, there is. A block has a soft limit to size. This is to prevent the blockchain from growing uncontrollably. If more transactions occur than what can fit in a block, some of the transactions are deferred til the next block.
If you wish for your transactions to have priority over others, offer a greater transaction fee for processing it. It is in the best interest of miners to process the transactions with the greatest fees first.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:58:46
That isn't how an exchange works...
Exchanges don't buy and sell, they just match buyers with sellers, and take a percentage.
If everyone tries to sell, and there isn't anyone interested in buying, the transactions will never go through. Mt Gox doesn't buy your bitcoins when you click the sell button.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:07:43
It would not be profitable for mt gox to do what you are suggesting.

More miners doesn't improve the network's performance, more miners increases the difficulty, thus requiring more processing power to function. A surge in TX fees would spur more miners to cash in (right now tx fees average around half a bitcoin per block), but the increase in miners would increase the difficulty, increasing the cost of mining, offsetting the reward from the increased tx fee.
An attacker could generate spammy traffic. Individual mining nodes can choose to process or ignore these transactions. There is a patch to the bitcoin daemon which actually ignores satoshidice transactions. Not a lot of people use it, but it exists. [Link](
There have also been suggestions of patches which would invalidate some of the bitcoins mined from early in the blockchain which are hoarded by a few very early adopters. Right now, those bitcoins represent a threat to the bitcoin ecosystem, If they were dumped onto the market, they would utterly crash the market.
It is up to the miner to decide which transactions to recognize, and which to ignore. If a miner doesn't like transactions, they can feel free to not include them in the block. That is the right of the miner, and allows a "democracy" in the ecosystem. The more mining you do, the more your vote can matter.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:55:51
This isn't about transfer fees... transfer fees are taken care of as transactions occur.
This is about all of the paperwork and bullshit that you need to go through to be able to do things like bank transfers.
Add bonus bullshit for every form of currency you plan on supporting.
Those costs are non-trivial, and required before you can really offer services as an exchange.

You are talking "on average". It is statistically possible that your very first attempt at a solution will work, and that on the subsequent block, your very first attempt at a solution will work. Statistically improbable to the point of nearly impossible, but it is possible. Because OP talked about "luck", this is a thing that could happen if you were "lucky". It would prolly never happen, and if it did, only once in many lifetimes, but it is a probability.
Difficulty is a means to decrease the probability that you will find the correct answer, it doesn't actually mean there is more work to be done to get an answer.

Miners have no obligation to include your transaction AT ALL.
The greater the transaction fee you attach, the more incentive there is for miners to include it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:25:51
It still wouldn't be necessary as long as the merchants trusted each other.
In this sort of a situation, you would still have 1 primary "bank", which all of the vendors would report transactions to.
Systems like bitcoin are only useful in situations where trust **cannot** be established.
