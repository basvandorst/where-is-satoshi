@_date: 2017-11-28 21:38:29
Yes i'm waiting for the dip too but I don't know should I buy it.

That's the thing the electricity will be free for me (thank you corrupt government of Bulgaria) and the miner promises me a profit of 240$ a month.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:48:30
You are totally right! But man you are talking big money to 18 year old me.

Save the money in bitcoin and buy it that way?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:04:50
Well it will take some time but buy drugs with them, sell them irl -&gt; now you have 3 million dollars

That's exactly what i'm doing right now with just one difference I try to buy the dips not to forget the price. So far I have 0.16BTC. I have about 2000$ in a grey - zone loaning business (which I can't loose) I also do a little resale. I was thinking about a miner because the one I was looking at was giving me 240$ a month no matter the price of Bitcoin (right?)
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:09
But isn't that more risky?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:07:33
Well the nature is untouched and quite unique and it's great for tourism but it's quite the shit hole for living :(
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:20:28
That could work 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:18:11
There are some like the cave "the eyes of god".
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:01:24
Fuck that we must be able to buy them later it ain't fun if they are rich as well... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:26:29
I will consider this, thank you :)

I also wrote essays about bitcoin and got 3xA. 
It was for finance, english classes and a business project where I had to make a corporation (mine was an exchange). And I got a couple of students and teachers interested in investing!
