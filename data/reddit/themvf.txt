This is laughable. First, just because someone went to the SEC doesn’t mean shit since the SEC doesn’t have jurisdiction. Second, just because someone went to the SEC doesn’t mean there’s a crime. I can write a letter to the SEC too. Third, the “insider trading laws,” which there are none don’t concern this type of activity. Section 10 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Act deal with mother fucking SECURITIES!

I agree, but they also show how much money they’ve made from the mining itself.

I looked back at my coinbase account and saw I had a purchase at $16 lol. Never held it of course.

Hodl is an ICO that will guarantee 10% monthly returns. It’s led by a great team that includes Satoshi.

If you read the FAQ carefully, they do explain the daily financing costs and that it is applied to your entire position. However, to charge financing on your own money is ridiculous.

Well, if an ICO is structured as a security then any sale in the USA falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction.

I instantly know someone’s experience level with cryptocurrency when they are surprised to find out they can buy a fractional of a bitcoin.

Of course it can. Look at the SEC litigation releases and see the cases against the manipulators.

I don’t think that’s what he’s saying. Perhaps in the future, but it appears Coinbase is fine for now.

I'm concerned about privacy right now. When I reg'd them, I didn't add private domain registration. I'm going to do that now, and I'll post later.

After making my first purchase with Coinbase and waiting a week, I can't possibly see myself going with them again.
Already signed up with mtgox.
@_date: 2013-01-20 22:22:10
Yea, I think that is a misstatement of the law, and a way to instil confidence in the site.

That is true, and what I and most other players will probably do. In fact, there shouldn't even be accounts. If you want to play a game, you send BTC to a certain address. Therefore, the site can't claim they even have US accounts.  However, I still believe we are not protected from the govt.

Ok I think we are getting somewhere.
So if I put 10 BTC on the site, and make that available for person B, what am I risking if that person has to have the money to cover the loan?
In normal situations, person B would have an unsecured debt obligation, but here, it seems to be secured by the fact that person B will always have the money available in case of interest payments and loss.
So I guess my question is, what are the risks of being a lender?

1) Bitcoins will be sent to one bitcoin account and held there.
2) The Govt doesn't seize them *per se*, but does not allow the site to distribute the funds until the matter is closed.

I should have prefaced my statement by saying as a trader, Coinbase is not the right answer. Right now I am missing too many price movements by waiting the week.

@_date: 2013-01-18 06:25:50
I was being facetious. My point is that it you buy BTC on Day 1 at X price from coinbase, you are forced to wait 7 days to use the BTC. Therefore, you are implementing a "buy and hold strategy." It was a joke. Perhaps not a good one.

As someone who has their funds frozen, fool me twice, shame on me?

Yea, we want more crazies associated with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-01-16 18:49:46
Ok. I was thinking of a different scenario. I was thinking that someone, person A, has $1000. That person will lend X amt to person B, for X% interest for a defined term. Person B will use those funds to generate profits through trading. It's as if Person A was "staking" Person B. You are basically saying the "lender" is a money converter. 
But, even in your scenario, wouldn't it still be cheaper to convert funds outside the website than agree to the lending terms posted? 
@_date: 2013-01-20 21:36:34
The DOJ. At least for us US players. If we have our funds on that site, then the DOJ will freeze the funds we have.
The fact that we are using bitcoins/euros/anything else does not matter.
I don't see how we are protected.
@_date: 2013-01-08 02:52:09
Any update?
@_date: 2013-01-21 22:52:35
Just get ready to wait. If you need BTC instantly, coinbase is not the answer. Stil waiting for my first transaction to process.
@_date: 2013-01-22 00:58:14
Because it doesn't matter the medium you are using to play poker if the govt still views it as unlawful. Whether you are using bitcoin/usd/euros/monopoly money/ etc., it doesn't matter.
Your argument is like saying playing online poker as a US citizen is OK if first we transfer our funds to monopoly money and then load that monopoly money on to the poker site. Do you really think that type of run around will be tolerated?
Replace monopoly money with Bitcoins and you have our current situation.
Bitcoins don't operate in some type of independent universe. We are not citizens of The state of bitcoin. We are US citizens that own bitcoin. And because of that we have to follow US law. We can't buy illegal drugs with bitcoin, 16 year olds can't buy beer with bitcoin, and if we commit fraud with bitcoin, we are still liable for that under contract or tort action. 
@_date: 2013-01-17 03:26:50
Why are you getting sick of playing poker?
@_date: 2013-01-16 18:29:34
If BitFinex requires a trader to have X amt in funds to offset losses if that trader receives a loan, why would a trader take out a loan in the first place?

Honest feedback:
Completely redo your site. It look awful. Sportsbook people are used to a certain threshold of aesthetics and functionality, that your site fails to accomplish.
It seems like you rushed this idea. I would take a step back, look at the best in the industry, and re-create your site.
