I think they will help bring clear regulation and a sense of maturity. ICO clampdown and shaking out the greedy scammers littering social platforms is a work in progress, BTC will get a better image

Sorry if I'm not clear, I'm referring more to the deliberate spreading of misinformation for the benefit of the few that mislead the many. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 09:14:43
I can almost taste the anticipation in the air. One outlet says "Going down, hard" and another says "massive price 'splosions"  
I really wish the desperate clawing attempts at manipulation would go away. I'm looking at you too, twitter monkeys.

I get the feeling he took a gamble and lost big. He isn't stupid and has proven that, but this seems like a deep rooted anger that causes him to snap. Either that or it's making him rich, there's motivation from another source - he can't be that irrational without reason 
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:02:28
Isn't manipulation exactly what he's doing on Twitter anyway? He's preying on the vulnerable with misinformation.  
For someone that doesn't like crypto he spends an absurd amount of time talking utter bollocks about it
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:59:45


I understand the point you are trying to make, however even the author of this article refers to his 'calculations' as napkin math. There's only a problem if nobody does anything about it - which even they know wont happen. This doesn't back you up.
@_date: 2018-10-06 11:42:21
If any arrogant rich twats feel they have lost an outlet here and would like to fulfil their need to pay forth their now cancelled debt, I will gladly accept any and all payments to help enable you to feel a true sense of redemption.  
I will also make sure to reference you as "A decent spud" and "not a total knobend"

4000 votes in a purely online survey of which 3515 already own bitcoin.  
Of course the older generations will be falling off the chart, I'd rather have the perspectives of people who aren't doing an already biased survey.

Hear me out for a second though, assuming a steady uptrend and allowing for inflation over say, 5 years as a very small example, by my calculations your $0.000000037 could, and very possibly could have a projection of absolutely fuck all.
