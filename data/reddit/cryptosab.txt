Nobody can predict this stuff short term, it's too volatile. Long term, it will go up, maybe not $100K, but atleast $30K. Nobody knows, really. Your best bet is to put little money here and there that you can afford to lose. It's called dollar cost averaging. Let's say you buy 100$ today  When the price is at $10000, let's say you buy $100 more. So you buy and store at any price, just a little amount that you can afford to lose. In the long term, you will make more profit. Of course, you need to be in there for the long term.

Once you travel back through time and change the past, you create a new timeline. What happens next is still unpredictable.
