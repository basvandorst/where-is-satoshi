Maybe because Lightning is Decentralised? Anybody can create a Lightning Node, that means it's decentralised.

Normal computer is fine. It don't use much computer power at all. You don't need a dedicated rig. Just a normal computer, connected to the internet is all that's required.

When I say it's coming, please do not assume anything. I don't know what it's going to look like when it comes. We'll see when it comes, how it works. Will be very interesting to see the new upgrade. I hope it'll be good. Just be patient and see how it works. There's nothing wrong with waiting for them to finish their testing. It's a lot to test as you've stated.

The fee to get into Lightning is same as a normal bitcoin transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:09:00
Yeh I'm still waiting for more tutorials to come out and ones that's related to the real network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:06:03
The high fees is making lightning development faster. They should have increased the block size, but it didn't, which is a problem now.

You go to this site  The bottom graph has Green and Red lines. Green are Buy walls, red are sell walls. IF you look now, there's a little wall at 18k. That 18k means Price $18,000 USD. Hover your mouse over that 18k red wall, it tells you how much USD can be bought before it goes pass that little red wall.

I agree. I had to read the article to see. Article did say it's going to update it for the real network when it's done.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:18:10
Check it out. Dec 6 they did the world's first lightning payments on the mainnet. It's looking good so far.

I didn't say it's 1:1 ratio. Based on the price, you can see its a huge demand, that's all I'm saying. When a huge demand comes in, it takes awhile for other things to upgrade. The high demand stresses the system, and what you can see now is transaction fees very high and slow. That's where all the problem is. Since they didn't make a block 2MB (I agree with you that it should have been doubled, but it didn't), they're going to lightning. New software takes time to develop, since the demand went up high so fast, other stuff takes awhile to upgrade. I'm saying just be patient. Other coins will be popular to those that want low transaction fees, that's why they have their own demand. When lightning comes in, transaction fees will go down and you'll start to see more people transact with bitcoin again.

Yes I hear its very fast, and very cheap. I don't think you need to wait a day to use it...just whatever confirmation the site requires. Once it's there, its dirt cheap and very fast. I think took 5 seconds. Fees was in the satoshis. On Dec 6 there was the first ever lightning transaction on the real bitcoin network. Payment of 0.000019 bitcoin (1,900 Satoshi) (at $14,000 per btc on Dec 6 = 0.000019x14000= $0.266 and the fee was 546 Satoshi (546 x $14000 / 100,000,000 = $0.076)  It's looking good. Check the full details here   In future, anyone can run a Lightning node, and they can set their own fees and earn bitcoin by running the node - so there'll be competition there.

Lightning network is new. It's still in testing mode. They hope to get it fully tested and launched next year 2018. They're testing it out now. If all goes good, it should be the same as the current system, so short answer is no, your funds won't be stolen, and no it's not common because it's not live yet. Long answer is wait and see how the testing go.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:33
I don't understand your point. How will the channels not open in the first place? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:08:39
Yes it says it in the article in big and bold.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:50:45
Be patient. Bitcoin grew too fast, that's why the transaction fee is a problem. Give it time, and let Developers catch up and fix the system. Lightning Network is looking promising, but give them time to test it out and then roll it out live. Just think of the beginning when we had the internet and how slow everything is...now it's super fast and we still want faster. Bitcoin will catch up, just give it time..
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:49:50
you can load some of your bitcoin and make some fees when people use your lightning node
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:38:05
That's how it works, yes. That's if everything is at that instant moment. But it's always changing, like the waves of the ocean, so you'll see it change all the time, but it's good to use it as an snapshot at that moment in time. That's why you see darker lines and lighter ones, it always updates.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:54:24
It's just a normal transaction. Time will tell how it'll work.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:36:27
You join the channel with your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:41:04
When transaction fees are high, there's more demand to get lightning working. A lot of people not happy with high fees. If you increase block size, transaction fees will be cheap again and demand for lightning drops out. Companies will put Developers into other stuff more important and the cycle continues.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:45
If you are doing 10 transactions a week, instead of 10, you do 1 on the main bitcoin network, and 10 on the lightning. IF both parties always transferring back and forward, you can keep the channel open and keep using lightning, and you don't even touch the main network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:35:24
Lightning is like a prepaid account - if you're always paying someone in bitcoin and doing small transactions (eg $3) - you're paying bitcoin transaction fee each time you pay $3. With lightning, you prepay your account (eg $100), and you pay fee to bitcoin network once. Each time you use your prepaid account, you don't pay bitcoin fee, but you pay lightning fee, which is dirt cheap. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:33:03
I said Lightning is coming. I didn't say it's going to be perfect. I said they are testing it now on testnet. I never said it's going to be perfect. Just be patient is all I said.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:43:24
In 6 months, it grew from $2k to $19k. In 1 month, it grew from $6k to $19k - both of these are huge adoption rate. It's going to stress the system, and that stress is the transaction fee and delay. Too much demand. Regarding lightning network, it's not if lightning delivers...it's when. Lightning will work, I saw demo already and it's good, and they're testing it now on bitcoin's testnet. Regarding the internet, just think of youtube - it wouldn't be possible 17 years ago when it took 1 hr to download an mp3, now it's possible. Bitcoin will do just that, with lightning it's going to be faster and will help - but these new software takes a lot of time for development and testing. Bitcoin now is expensive to transfer, so other coins will help. It's a whole ecosystem, not just bitcoin itself but everything together helps each other as a whole.

No idea. Have to wait for it to come out. It'll be cheap though because other people will do it too and there's going to be competition. So you'll have to factor in electricity cost vs earning fees. I think some people will be running those tiny cheap raspberry pi linux machine.

Lighting is coming...its not if, its when. Here's the latest test for you on Dec 6th when video was posted. It looks good man. It will come.   Andreas also talks about lightning here, he's been running the test node for 4 months now. He says people can even run a lightning node and make money for it too, it's amazing  I agree with you with high transaction fee. I too wanted the double up of block size, but it didn't happen so no point focusing on it. Might as well focus on lightning.
