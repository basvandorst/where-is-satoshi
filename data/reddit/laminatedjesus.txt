I want to reply once more to alert you to your risk here.  If you want to hold Bitcoin for safe keeping you must absolutely put it into a Bitcoin Wallet that you control the private key to.  Your "Bank" of your poker site is in control of this key most likely.  If they want to they can steal your bitcoin, or more likely it can be stolen from them.  There are no reversals of Bitcoin transactions.  If it is stolen, it is gone.  I don't care what insurance they state you have.  If they can't afford to pay out losses from theft, you will not get anything.  Please, for your own financial sake, learn about how private/public key pairs work for Bitcoin.  Look at hardware wallets.  At the very least look into creating a paper wallet, safely, offline.  If you do not know what a hardware or paper wallet it, someone is going to take advantage of your lack of knowledge and Bitcoin you think is yours can be stolen.  I say this as I would to a member of my family, PLEASE PROTECT YOURSELF.  If you were a member of my family I wouldn't let you continue using this poker site as a "bank".  Yikes this scares me so bad for you.

Long term I’d rather hold crypto because I’m up 500% on the year with Bitcoin and prefer to play alt cycles very short term. I also practice secure methods so I know what wealth I have at all times. I prefer this over a much more limited growth stock market that may be doing well but is obviously due for a correction at the least but is also susceptible to a massive meltdown not to mention manipulation while crypto has actually shown more stable in the fact that long term values are up tremendously and each year a bottom goes in place that is just leaps and bounces higher. When you put it all into a long term perspective the stock market is just too risky for me. If you believe crypto will crash then I congratulate you on your perpetual argument that you think you are winning.  If you have made money good for you and I hope you do well. Good luck.

Agree with your thoughts.  This price is no longer scary. A $5600 dip would trigger some emotions but I think $5200 or lower will really scare some holders out of the market - and that’s their goal. 
Bright side is after a shake out like that the price could rebound very quickly. Especially with a catalyst such as an ETF right around the corner afterward. 
My estimate is another delay of BTC ETFs to March 2019 as it is the furthest the SEC can push it out by law. Perhaps another nasty crash in December and January so the larger players can get in some real volume before institutions release their OTC market purchased backed BTC ETFs and drive prices back to all time highs. An expected correction of stocks/equities(especially FANGs) around this same time would further propel this as investors move to crypto currency funds to keep their income flowing as stocks stagnate.

Well if markets are falling and making money is tough you may see investors move to perhaps a BTC ETF to make money off trading that.

Still not sure...most of the "it is a scam" people rely on data showing that tether was created as BTC/USD price dropped.  But, that's exactly when buying volume spikes.  So it makes sense to me.  Isn't that just the fact that someone is depositing real USD to Bitfinex and they are creating the Tethers to match it?  Maybe it is manipulated, but for me to believe this I would need to see additional evidence to convince me.  It probably is manipulated though.

I would be selling alt bags across the board. BTC dominance will continue to rise most likely. This is in anticipation for an approved BTC ETF.

The “whales” are purchasing on non-exchange OTC markets. Think craigslist for $100m in BTC. It’s also how the ETF producers back their shares. Bear trap? Maybe. But the longer this ETF hope stays alive the more a chance of an upturn.  It’s a guarantee of capital to enter a market with more active trading.  Alts don’t have an ETF coming. Maybe ETH sometime will trade on the worlds  and  financial exchanges. It’s all about hype right now in this market. BTC will move but overall should gain on ETF hype imo.  The longer the ETF decisions linger the better. I know everyone wants everything now but to me this is good news.

One must look past the law itself and understand the implications of it beyond itself. 
What the Bill is achieving with its classification of digital assets is that virtual currencies would have the same legal status as money under commercial law. Money has “super-negotiability” rules under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 9, and Wyoming would give virtual currencies the same.
This classification could be very beneficial for coin lending businesses as UCC 9-332(a) reads: “A transferee of money takes the money free of a security interest unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party.” Meaning that as long as the transferee isn’t colluding to avoid the lien, Bitcoin transfers are free and clear of it.

Bitcoin will continue to reach new highs over time not only because more of the world will see value in it over time but mainly because the dollar is always becoming worth less. 
Not to mention bitcoin inflation continues decreasing to zero means supply will be capped. 
We’ve mined most of the Earths gold already.  Look at what that has done to gold’s price. 
Also Bitcoin miners will compete to secure the network and claim rewards and fees perpetually putting up higher costs to mine and subsequently raising the price of “production” and the price at which these miners would sell if that is their goal. 
Every way you look at this Bitcoin price goes up over time.  Put any dollar amount out there and Bitcoin will hit it. Just give it time.  At some point the dollar just ceases to exist.  
3 kinds of money
“God’s Money” - gold silver etc
Fiat - $$$$
Digital currency - Bitcoin
Will gold be here in 100 years?  Yeah.  It’s been here for a long time. 
Will fiat be here in 100 years?  Sure. Except the dollar has only been around for 200 some years.  Another one may take over as the world reserve currency as it has before many times. 
Will Bitcoin be here in 100 years?  What do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:13:29
I still don’t see how 128MB blocks would be a problem?  It would be fairly far down the road.  Users don’t need to run full nodes and download the entire chain.  Users can run a miner that also doesn’t need a full chain to reference. That doesn’t provide a similar decentralization effort?
Short term scaling might be important as other currencies are increasing in value and have solved scaling in various ways. 
Lightning and SegWit are newer technologies.  Is it possible they have an issue we haven’t foreseen?  We know raising the blocksize works.  Why delay it?
Still confused at why this debate is still happening. I would have expected BTC to at least raise the blocksize temporarily to give fees a little breathing room. 
If credit cards has a volume issue and you couldn’t use it without paying a $3 fee on a cup of coffee we would find an alternative pretty quickly. Even with all the infrastructure built around it. 
I don’t think I can be convinced by your points. I think this debate will continue for awhile for this reason.  ASICs are here to stay. There is no around it.  More companies need to compete in this market.  
The answer is not to let fees rise, deal with it, and change the roadmap.  I think this is very wrong and detrimental to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:37:06

Only thing that can save face is a block size increase even if it’s temporary. But Core won’t do that as it weakens their chokehold on transaction fees and would make them look silly as they opposed this strongly.  
This “work” they are doing will be stagnant as long as possible to feed their goals as a for profit company.  They are literally doing the same thing to Bitcoin that Banks and Corporations have done to fiat.

Adoption is increasing.  The technology and code behind bitcoin is progressing.  Before these two are saturated the price will increase.  I don’t think there is any way to stop the price from increasing right now.  Supply stays the same mostly but the demand is increasing rapidly.  Once demand stops increasing so rapidly we will probably see some price stabilization. When this will happen?  Probably not for a few decades in my opinion. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 12:32:29
Wyoming is trying to do this. Not saying they will succeed.  The courts will strike it down at the federal level.  I think Wyoming’s goal is to bring in crypto business with their no state income tax on crypto and to try to set legal precedence that the feds may use themselves if we are lucky.

You sound confident that alternative solutions for scaling are needed than what is available right now. What is the current risk with short term scaling that has been suggested by some?  Aka Big blockers?  I see this notion that it will not work mentioned quite a bit.  The original roadmap was to scale block size as needed?  What changed?
I’ve read a lot from the other side of the debate and understand that position I think.  Keep it the same as designed originally. It works. 
If the reasoning against large blocks is all about hardware to support large blocks being too expensive I just don’t see that as a hindrance anytime soon for most.  I’m hoping there is something I’m missing because that argument just sounds silly to me.

This one is free. The rest you should really look for on your own so you can understand the truth. 
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it. As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overproof-of-workered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overproof-of-worker the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

@_date: 2017-11-23 17:48:33
I think it’s stabilized because it’s bitcoin that works properly right now.  It’s a race against the clock for SegWit now.  The longer it takes for transactions to confirm and the higher fees are the faster BCH adoption goes and the faster BTC gets dumped.  The only thing propping it up is people buying BTC right now. That’s all. Not because it’s easy to use or cheap or convenient. Keep it up and BTC loses. Easy as that. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 20:38:33
Once they start hearing reports of large institutions launching trading platforms and showing they own crypto most people will wonder if they should get some crypto.  Then, if crypto is stable compared to other markets that may very well be turning downward....light it up.

His company is long term focused and he admits he’s been too optimistic on price.  He thinks we won’t get regulatory changes such as an ETF approval until late 2019 so likely he said he will be wrong again so more like 2020. 
I don’t understand how people can be so upset about someone giving price predictions.  This guy has been talking up crypto to an audience of old school financial people who aren’t interested and do not understand crypto.  What have these fools complaining here done to further education of crypto?

No coins “go where you go” just the private keys do. The hardware device will hold your keys and be extremely hard to hack.  Just be careful when sending coins from it. Double check your addresses. When the device is unplugged you can rest easy. 
Remember your coins are on the blockchain at all times. So is your wallet.  Transactions can go to your wallet at any time but with your hardware wallet they can’t be spent from your wallet unless the device is plugged in and unlocked with your pin. At that moment you are vulnerable. Make your transactions quickly and verify your addresses before sending. 
You made a very good choice. Your keys your coins.

Exodus is a closed source wallet. They could steal your funds and you would have no idea how and be unable to prove it.  Not saying they will or even can. Just that it’s unknown without auditing their code.
Use an open source wallet, preferably with a hardware wallet holding your private keys.
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:47:47
Trezor or Ledger
Trezor is open source entirely which requires you to use a long passphrase as cracking the device is more easily accomplished. 
Ledger has a closed source secure chip which makes the device less likely to be “hacked” if someone gets their hands on it.  It is closed source by law because of the security firmware being property of Ledger by law they have to keep it closed source.  But, they have open source app development for connecting different wallets to it. 
I’ve used Ledger but have not used Trezor.  Either seem equally usable according to most community members.

Keep in mind the internet failed to scale for years.  It was slow. Emails took days/weeks to route.  The post office was delivering mail.  Few saw the problems that were being solved.  Take away email/the internet today and society collapses.  Bitcoin has the capability of solving many problems.
Problem 1 - fees
Fees eat into every financial transaction from companies paying companies to you buying coffee with your credit card.  Fees are eating into value.
Problem 2 - trust
Financial transaction require previous trust.  IE: You trust your bank to not take your paycheck when you deposit it.  Bitcoin does not require trust and functions as a no-trust|verify instead system.
Problem 3 - control
Money is a system of control used by governments since the inception of money.  Control the money control the population.  Bitcoin removes this control.  Funds cannot be seized and supply of the currency cannot be manipulated.
These problems will only become more relevant as time goes on as the internet has proved previously.

Yes just public and private keys. There are multiple software options to input those 2 keys safely to send transactions when the time comes.  The paper wallet creator may have another option to input your private key alone and it should translate to the public key properly. This will ensure you have recorded the correct information. Remember do this all OFFLINE.

Most likely "You people" is actually the whales aka the market movers aka the people pushing the price down aka the people looking for a sale aka the people buying their own sell orders aka market manipulation aka keeping it underpriced so they can soak up more.
PEOPLE that are investing and looking to make money and HODLers are not selling - they are buying with every dollar they have.  Don't get it twisted.

They didn't get denied - The SEC asked them to withdraw them and defined what should be added for them to approve it - now it has been resubmitted with exactly what the SEC asked for.
If you think this will get denied its probably because you sold all your crypto and you hope it doesn't.

If approved the start date is irrelevant. Price will most likely rise immediately and maybe over exuberantly.

The real answer is in the decision press release. Read it. Winklevoss twins fucked up tying their ETF to the Gemini exchange price solely which leaves it open to manipulation by only being tied to one exchange. My guess is 90% of these commenters don’t even read it.

For example, the BTC Futures on CBOE were approved as they aggregated prices from multiple exchanges to determine prices.  Winklevoss wanted to determine price based on Gemini ONLY.  These guys are dumb and keep getting denied for VALID reasons.

I support her but do not support her dissent.
The investment objective of the Trust would be for the Shares to track the price of bitcoin on the Gemini Exchange, which is a digital-asset exchange owned and operated by the Gemini Trust Company. 29 The Net Asset Value (“NAV”) of the Trust would be calculated each business day, based on the clearing price of that day’s 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (“ET”) Gemini Exchange bitcoin auction, a two-sided auction open to all Gemini Exchange customers (“Gemini Auction”). 30 The Intraday Indicative Value (“IIV”) of the Trust would be calculated and disseminated by the Sponsor, every 15 seconds during BZX’s regular trading session, based on the most recent Gemini Auction price.
Additionally, given the current disparity between the Gemini Auction volume and the trading volume that would equal a creation unit—and the resulting likelihood that creation or redemption activity would substantially affect the Gemini Auction price—BZX has not shown that the ability of the Trust to use other criteria to value the Trust’s bitcoins in “extraordinary circumstances”166 adequately addresses the risk that creations and redemptions, or manipulative activity such as front running, may affect the Gemini Auction price on an ordinary day. In light of the risks that creation and redemption activity may substantially affect the Gemini Auction price—and that the use of other valuation criteria may fail to address the effects of creation and redemption activity or of manipulative activity—the Commission cannot conclude that the bitcoin pricing mechanism of the Trust is uniquely resistant to manipulation.

You must mean in the US because Switzerland has had one for almost a year, perhaps longer.  I'm not sure when they launched it exactly.
  
  
So if you mean the USA specifically you must think that the United States would sit idle as other countries start trading these funds and lower their risk by diversifying their investments?  If other markets start tanking Bitcoin would be hedge against them due to its limited supply and increasing usage.

Stop supporting this dissent unless you fully understand the decision.  I have a feeling everyone running Commissioner Peirce's side did not read the decision.
Winklevoss ETF was to determine its priced based on current BTC/USD on the Gemini exchange, solely.  As in, if someone pumps the shit out of the price on that exchange, their ETF price would follow.  This is not ideal as it leaves the ETF open to manipulation by Gemini.
For example, the CBOE BTC futures price is determined by aggregating prices from multiple exchanges, not just one, owned by THEMSELVES.
Come on guys, this is an easy denial.

I wouldn’t be surprised if more than 50% of all volume from day 1 until now was wash trading.  This market is made of a small group of people.  Market movers are taking advantage while they can.  When crypto is more widely adopted and more money comes into the market they will be less and less able to swing prices for profit. 
The next bull run may be the one that goes high and long with minimal corrections as these market movers take their foot off the gas and brakes and just let it ride.

Think of all the work it takes your bank to accept your paychecks or direct deposits, to keep track of your account, to watch out for fraud, to hire employees and give them benefits, to manage those employees, to setup policies for withdrawals and deposits, to setup ATMs, to interface with other banks on your behalf.  Whew!  
Comes along Bitcoin that does all of these things by itself by you.  You setup your own account, you keep track of your money, you control your withdrawals and deposits, etc.  Sure you may pay fees to do those things but they are far more cheaper than the banks doing all of those things with different applications and architectures and not to mention there's hundreds of them around the world.  
Bitcoin is global, baby.

All institutions want to buy at the lowest prices but at the same time do not want to pump the price so high that future buys they make are too expensive to them. 
This is a fickle game they are playing buying in large amounts and then letting the market settle down.  You can see this on the charts on these large jumps and then tiny squiggles.
When these squiggles terminate their wedges you may see another super jump in price as we have seen 3 times in a row in the past week or two.

Had a dream in June 2017. 
Was in a field.  3 Coyotes surrounded me and followed me with no ill intentions I could see.  They seemed like they wanted to be friends. They ran away shortly after I moved toward a house.  A bear shows up.  Bear charges me in the garage of the house.  A man comes out of the house and grabs the bear by the neck as it charges and chokes the bear out.  The man acts like it was nothing and disappears.  
I think my dream was telling me to be wary of the market. I had just started investing at this time.  Maybe I was warning myself of this bear market to come.  If my dream stays true something will end this bear cycle suddenly.  I don’t think that has happened yet but it seems as if the market may be priming itself for the event. We are edging back to a bullish sentiment but not there yet. One significant piece of news, adoption, partnership, regulation, or something may be the catalyst for a turning point.  To me, that would make sense for the market at this time.   Perhaps something like amazon or eBay accepting crypto directly may change the game here.

Basically some guy opened an exchange and didn't require ID for transactions so people could sell their bitcoins that they stole from other people.  It may be that he helped launder the $400m stolen from Mt Gox. They got him for a total of $4 billion. They have tracked all his crypto assets and are investigating further while he is in custody singing like a bird naming everyone else I'm sure. Fun fact: they can't determine the amount of Monero he has. Monero is a truly anonymous cryptocurrency. Raise your awareness of it.

Downward price pressure could put us near $2k. Maybe a fast crash to $1250-$1500. But it will be like a balloon underwater.  Exchanges are being used to manipulate shorts and longs.
