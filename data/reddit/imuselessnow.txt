I'm pretty sure I just did it in the blockchain.info site.

Ok, so stupid question maybe but the last couple days have me sufficiently paranoid:
If I delete the wallet on blockchain.info will it affect the paperwallet I printed? 
Was this something I was supposed to have done as soon as I printed the paper wallet?
Should I delete the one on blockchain.info? 
Is there some safer way to generate a paper wallet?  
Should I move the coins to a new one before deleting the one on bc...info
I'm a gox'd user, I can't really complain cause I was too late to the party and too broke to have much to lose there but they took half of all the bitcoin I had at the time a whopping .6 BTC. The other half I had managed to move to blockchain.info when the reports of withdrawal limits from gox hit.
Then hearing how the safest way was a paper wallet I generated one with the help of blockchain.info printed it out and stuck it in my safe.
Since then I have been using the paper address to send my coins to when I buy on coinbase. I haven't recovered  from gox enough to spend any quite yet but, it's almost Christmas and now I'm trying to prepare to proceed with caution.
As I understand it's stupid of me to keep all my coins in a wallet on a website like blockchain.info and although I thought a paper wallet was different than an online wallet when I printed it seveal months ago when logging into blockchain.info now I still see the wallets ID and balance but I understand that you can see any addresses' balance so I'm confused and don't want to overreact or move the coins if that's not safe or necessary.
