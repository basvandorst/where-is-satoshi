Worst advice ever

Because people can sell fractional bitcoins, there’s no real limit. It’s not like if there were only 21million bananas in the world, and once someone bought them there gone. You can slice that banana up into infinite pieces.

Gold has an intrinsic value as a unit. You need certain  volumes to create jewelry. But to your point, there are ETFs that let you break it further but that’s still not the same you can make synthetic etfs for anything. 
No one wants one golf atom, but someone would want one .0001 of bitcoin

There is infinite supply of bitcoin. There is not a limited supply. There is just a limit on the currency being devalued by outside means aka mining.

It’s basically saying that there are 21million bananas but you can slice those bananas into infinitely smaller pieces. It’s not like Beenie babies or limited edition cards that once they sold there will never be another opportunity to get them. You can’t slice that valuable beenie babie in half if you do it’s worthless. but you can slice up that bit coin in half and it’s worth half of the whole.

No that would be a massive mistake. Because bitcoins are only worth their utility as either a means of exchange or investment value. If you owned every bitcoin, there would be no utility or value and they would be worthless.

There is infinitely smaller fractionalized coins , there’s not a cap in reality.

Sell it all now

There is a cap at 21 Million coins, but there are infinitely small coins so there is really no cap and unlimited supply
