Sometimes it seems like this subreddit cares about the actual purchasing power of bitcoin, and other times it's a bunch of speculators trying to make a quick buck. I think both kinds of bitcoin users can coexist, but if bitcoin is supported solely by a bubble, it won't last as more people buy in trying to make a quick buck.

I'm glad you're talking about bitcoin as an actual currency and not a commodity. You're definitely right about bitcoin not being based on debt, which is something I haven't really thought about much (admittedly, I haven't studied much on economics). Even if bitcoin doesn't need to rely on inflation, though, I don't see why people should be excited about such a huge change in the purchasing power of bitcoins. Bitcoins were created to be used as a safe, anonymous, electronic currency separate from the USD and other government currencies, but people on here only seem to be interested in its value in USD. Bitcoins can only survive if people attempt to use it as a currency, not as an opportunity for speculation.

How would people who "adopt" bitcoin just because they see the price surging be good for bitcoin as a currency? Those are the type of people that will simply hoard them instead of using them in real transactions.
At this stage I don't see this deflation being harmful, as it will probably rectify itself in time, but for people to really adopt bitcoin as a *currency*, we need to be seeing stable purchasing power, or even periods of gradual inflation.
