Inflation is not the same as divisibility, sorry. I'm no compscientist so I don't know if dividing Satoshis is possible, but if it is it won't result in inflation. Inflation is an increase in the money supply *relative* to one's own holdings. In the future if the Fed decides to replace all $100 bills with $1 bills, and all $1 bills with pennies (just as Mexico has done before with pesos) that wouldn't result in deflation *or* inflation, as your relative holding of the currency would stay the same.

True, Austrian Economics is less of a natural science and more akin to axiomatically deduced theory such as geometry. AE is based off of what you could call fundamental truths about individual human action and their desires in daily life and commerce. Statistics are used by Austrian economists as a tool to help explain the past but not as a tool to predict the future. An austrian economist would be the first to admit that human actions in the congregate are *not* like purposeless atoms bouncing off each other according to fundamental scientific principles, but that the range and magnititude of human desires and choices is endless and constantly changing. Therefore using past statistics as a way to predict the future is a folly if it is not coupled with fundamental principles that are unchanging. Austrian Economics is by far the most humble economic tradition in admitting the limitations of their field.

I'm sorry, but that's *just some bad advice*. Halfway kidding, couldn't stop myself. 
Anyways, I don't think ClearMoody is against profit-motivation, in fact he specifically points out how an acceptance of the Bitcoin ideology leads to *higher* profits. No one is implying we shouldn't tell merchants how Bitcoin will profit them. What is being advocated is not to celebrate the financial success you may have gained by the rise in Bitcoin too much. That will pull in investors who wll see it as a get rich quick scheme and will pull out as soon as they see a dip, or when they make their big pot of fiat.
This won't kill Bitcoin, but it will make it more volatile, and it will hurt acceptance by merchants. If we preached the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and the principles it was based upon, you won't lose investment, rather you will attract a certain kind of investor. One who will not be swayed by the shifting media-winds, one who will not only invest in Bitcoin, but in Bitcoin businesses and infrastructure. His goal will not just be great personal  wealth but to fundamentally change the system as we know it. The other kind of investor is already a beneficiary of the system, has profited from it, and has no reason to change it. For them, Bitcoin is just a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.

It may seem like an overreaction, but its actually the general consensus. It may seem "fair" to let the developer premine, but it actually undermines the validity of the coin. Usually a developer will stir up for his altcoin before beginning the mining, so anyone interested can get in early.The few altcoins that had premining have been dismal failures. Nobody wants to put money into an altcoin in the beginning if the creator can take their cash with no cost to himself. When you buy a coin on an exchange you don't actually know if you're getting a specific portion of a finite supply (scarcity retains value) because you don't know if the coin was mined by the system, or just the creator pawning of some of his hoard.
NovaCoin is an (almost) dead altcoin where the developer premined 200k coins. He then used 140k to bribe BTC-E to put the coin on the exchange. The backlash was so intense that BTC-E publicly **destroyed** the coins as an apology. Link: (
Premining is a "get rich quick" scheme. Create an altcoin, build up interest, buy the price up, and then dump. Or in Ripple's case: trickle dump over time. There is no rationale for this besides huge profits for the developers. And anyone who adopts it are the ones providing that profit. I'm sure Satoshi's got a big stash but he earned that on a level playing field with anyone else who wanted to mine. Bitcoin picks no favorites, all are on a level playing field. 
As for bills... It's honestly not that expensive to run a website after you've developed it. Its no different than the costs that Bitcoin exchanges have to meet. And truth is that Ripple actually *has* major [**VC**]( backing. Ripple may be advertised as a revolutionary p2p exchange-currency, but in reality its a business. It has investors and it will pay them off by offloading premined coins at no cost. 
So **yes**. You would be a sucker if you tried to invest in a heavily premined altcoin. It may not be illegal, but its by all means a **scam**. *However*, Ripple could turn out to be a good thing if it became a viable way to trade BTC &amp; USD p2p by converting into RPX for the transaction. Then Ripple would only be an exchange, and the fees you pay make up for that. But as a currency its a ripoff.

@_date: 2013-03-25 07:17:35
This may be a little confusing, but I think it's good to know what *actually* is going on. Bitcoins *never* actually leave the network. They *never* actually go onto your computer, and you *never* have to store them. Confused? Good.
When you decide to purchase some Bitcoins you will create two long random-*looking* strings of numbers called a **public** and a **private** key. Although, the common lingo is that Bitcoins are "sent" to someone's public key, this is not the case. 
The Bitcoins never leave the network. This is good because it means that each Bitcoin is accountable, no one can counterfeit and introduce a Bitcoin to the network, and all Bitcoin transactions can be verified and documented. 
How then does the network know who owns what Bitcoins? Good question, and this is where your keys come in. These keys may look random, but they anything but. When someone "sends" you bitcoins they are *actually* **encrypting** these Bitcoins on the network in a way that no one (besides you) can use them. They do this by using your public key as the "instructions" on how to scramble the Bitcoin data until it is essentially unusable.
These encrypted coins may seem impossible to rebuild, and they essentially are. Except to **you**. It turns out that the public-private keys you have have a very special relationship. Each one can be used to scramble data, in this case Bitcoins, and the other can unscramble it. This means that people can encrypt coins on the network in a way that only **you** have access to them.
To get to the crux of your question: You do not need to keep your Bitcoins on your computer. What you *do* need to do is save your private key somewhere safe, *secure*, and **PRIVATE**. This means making several backups so you won't lose your key if your computer crashes. 
There are many ways to make backups: 
* You can print it out on paper, or burn it to a cd, and store it in your vault.
* You can make a private key that you can memorize, but would be hard to guess
* You can encrypt your private key using encryption software and a good password so that you can store your key on your computer, send it to yourself via email, dropbox. Even if someone stumbles on it they won't know what it is, or how to decrypt it.
**Ps**: It is important that your private key is *never* exposed on your computer when it is *decrypted* where it can be vulnerable to being hacked. People have already lost millions because of this. Not only does this mean that you should disconnect your internet, but you should also use a computer that has "never" been used for anything else, especially the internet, so you can be sure there will not be any 'key'loggers or viruses. This does mean you need to go buy a new computer, lol. You'll just need to burn an [OS]( to a cd, pop it in your drive, restart your computer, and run off the cd. Your hard drive will be inactive, so you'll be running a completely "fresh" operating system. Confusing? Yes. Secure? More than the bank.

Yes if you link it to a software wallet than the software wallet should take care of the change address. But paper "wallets" are not really wallets, they are addresses, so if you just decide to send a portion from a your paper address the change won't be sent back to that same address.

I've found the easiest way in the US to be purchasing through your bank account on Coinbase. If you want to purchase anonymously, you would have to pay a premium and use LocalBitcoins, which I have not tried. The "quantum hack" could only be theoretically used on an address which you have send coins from. (When you send coins you must provide a hash of your private address, which could theoretically be broken with a quantum computer.) So if you are only receiving, there is no worry. If you are worried when you send Bitcoin, just send the balance of the account to a new address, so each address is only used once, and never carries a balance to be hacked after that.

I'd recommend reading some work by Stephen Kinsella. He is a patent lawyer so he has experience from within the system. He has presented a pretty damning case for the legitimacy and utility of patents. Before reading his work I was very much in favor of patents for the reasons you have stated. My viewpoint on patents has completely flipped now, and I now see patents as a *extremely* destructive force on the economy and creativity.

That's awesome! I think what most "bubble" people don't realize is that an increased value of Bitcoin actually *increases* stability. This is similar to when everybody switched from Myspace to Facebook a few years ago. At first it was only a trickle, then it started to pick up, and then it was like the dam burst, and now there's over a *billion* people using Facebook. Facebook and Bitcoin are both network systems; the more people that use it, (for Bitcoin this is translated to value), the more convenient and beneficial it is for someone else to adopt. For Bitcoin I see two options: **zero** or **HERO!**

Regulate it. Cannot possibly do harm. Those who wish to use it "unregulated" can, and *will*, do so. All regulation does is provide legitimacy to the sheeple who follow the law.
Of course I *want* Bitcoin to be unregulated. Knowing the government the choice will probably be between banning it or regulating it. Banning won't stop *us*, but it will stop new adopters. The truth is: if enough people adopt it because the state has given it "legitimacy" then we will be close to a "closed loop" for Bitcoin. This means we won't have to deal with USD as much and it will make it easier to skirt the regs. And the best part is even a ban won't work by that point.

Similar products are not the same value. People value different products differently. In a decentralized economy the average person will have no idea how to input the value in a way that creates a reliable blockchain.

Unfortunately it does give people an incentive to spend *unwisely*. By that I mean people are more likely to buy cheap, throw-away items (consumer culture America?) than save up for a more expensive hardy product. This hurts our environment *and* our economy as cheap manufacturing needs cheap labor, thus the outsourcing of the manufacturing sector. Inflation gives people an incentive to take out credit that they wouldn't otherwise do, as they want to take advantage of *today's* cheap prices. 
Inflation is a *bane* to investing, not the opposite. Investment money can only come from savings, and people are less likely to save with inflation (Low interest rates). Resources that would have gone to new research and development are now shifted to the production of cheap consumer products. 
Under deflation money in the future will be worth more than today so it is wise to *invest* one's money into ventures that will earn the investor money in the *future*. In the end an economy's *true* growth will be measured in the innovation and entrepreneurship funded by investment spending. Consumption spending will seem to help the economy in the short term, but if it pushes out investment spending and is funded by credit it inevitably leads to economic recessions.

Doubtful. Bitcoin has value because *we* all think it has value, not because the US government says it has value. Very few people use gold for goods and services but it maintains its value because people put value in it. If the US government tries this bullshit all it would do is cause a brain drain as engineers and entrepreneurs set up shop in other countries. 
Even if *every* country imposed this scheme all it would do is push Bitcoin into System D which is *not* what the US government wants, as they depend on System D to offload their inflation overseas.

You've got to realize that there isn't really all that much money being traded to manipulate this price. Especially after it just jumped back, there won't be that many buy offers below the median price. This means that someone can sell $25k worth of bitcoin in one fell swoop and the price will drop from $45 to $36. Do not for an instant think that this actually reflects the value of all 10million btc, however.

I don't think so, unless there is good reason to think that there won't be a positive return in the long run.

Ok steelclass, what do you know about Bitcoin? I think it's important to understand what its purpose is and its benefits are before investing. It is also important to gauge its current value against its potential. Some important benefits are:
* Little to no transaction fees
* quick international transfers
* no identity theft
* no chargebacks like paypal
* semi-anonymous
* non-inflationary
One easy application for Bitcoin would be the service that PayPal already provides, an internet based easy form of currency. Merchants would love an alternative to PayPal because of the frequency of chargebacks and any sort of transaction fee would be minimal. 
Even if Bitcoin only absorbed 10% of the PayPal market for internet currency that would *skyrocket* the value of Bitcoin to over $10k/Btc. This is just one application for Bitcoin, effectively its potential is unlimited. But to compare it to tulips or beanie babies is just infantile and illogical. To assume we're at the top of the bubble just because this is the highest price its ever hit speaks to me of someone who has no clear understanding of how Bitcoin works, or is someone who only sees it as a "get rich" speculation scheme.

You have many options:
1. **Create better threads**: Improve the content of this board directly.
2. **Create another subreddit**: As Bitcoin's popularity increases I cannot see one board covering all aspects of it. I envision many different, fully populated, bitcoin reddits in the future; each covering a different aspect of it, even one for personal stories.
3. **Vote**: The reason that these stories are on the front page is because (strangely enough) that seems to be the threads that people enjoy and upvote. It may seem strange to you that the majority of subscribers would rather read a personal anecdote than a technical/legal discussion but this is just evidence that Bitcoin is finally breaking into the mainstream. Do you really think that the majority of people will ever understand/care about the technical/legal ins and outs of Bitcoin? ***Not fucking likely.***
4. **Bitch about it in a thread**
**Conclusion:** As Bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream, the relative percentage of technical users will drop more and more. Unfortunately this means that eventually will eventually be primarily populated by people who jumped on because Bitcoin is "hip" or something. Of course these people will circlejerk personal stories.
Unfortunately, I predict will eventually fail to be the place that *we* (early adopters/idealists) go to have 'insightful discussion'. will always be the first Bitcoin subreddit that a newb finds. Once Bitcoin hits critical mass I'm sure will be just a board for Bitcoin stories, Bitcoin memes, and dummed-down Bitcoin news that everybody can understand. It's too bad, but on the other hand we'll all be filthy rich when that day comes. ;)

@_date: 2013-03-26 06:42:57
If it was almost *certain* that BTC will equal $100 very soon, then it would "almost" equal $100 right now. The fact of the matter is that many Bitcoin investors are *not* confident in the long term health of Bitcoin. These investors could *very quickly* exit the market at some scare, thereby dropping the price considerably. There are other investors that are not worried about these drops because they see the future success of Bitcoin as "inevitable". For them Bitcoin could see a collapse in value over the next few months and would not lose confidence. I am of the latter group.


If you see the enthusiasm for Bitcoin as "hype" then do *not* invest. "Hype" is responsible for every Ponzi scheme and con game. Before you put your precious dollars in something make **sure** you understand it thoroughly. 
Please note that I **am** a big supporter of Bitcoin. It would be easy for me to just tell you to invest, but it would be incredibly unwise for you to take financial advice from someone on the internet. Instead let me ask you a few questions:
* How does Bitcoin work?
* Can Bitcoin be hacked?
* What do miners *actually* do?
* Who decides how many Bitcoins are created?
* How are Bitcoins sent between people?
* List the main differences between Bitcoin and fiat money.
I suspect that you do not have a good answer to many of these questions. That is **okay** because you have all the answers at your fingertips. Within the archives of this subreddit alone you will likely be able to find everything you need. If that is too much work for you, do not invest. 
**Most** things that sound too good to be true **ARE** too good to be true. Do *not* accept advice from people on the internet just because they are invested. Remember, previous investors have a strong incentive to **lie** to you to get you to invest, because that means their investment goes up! Some investments are [entirely]( based on this principle. 
I want to applaud your interest in Bitcoin. You are in a privileged position to be a part of something **huge**, a new paradigm shift, that promises to change the world for the good of *all*. But don't take my word for it. I might just be trying to sell you my worthless Bitcoins ;)

Fundamentally a Bitcoin "bubble" can**not** be compared to a stockmarket or housing bubble. When we talk or about the stock, dotcom, or housing markets we are talking about an entire sector of the economy. 
Bitcoin, though unique, does **not** represent any sector of the asset economy. Even if you consider currency to be an "asset" it is then but a part of the *overall* currency sector.
Since BTC is only a small part of currency market, it cannot be be "bubbled" like the previous examples. This is because of **arbitrage**. The fact that BTC has competition means that its market value is unlikely to be vastly overpriced as any speculator could vary their investment with other currencies. In *contrast* it would be very hard to arbitrage during a asset bubble when **all** of the market is being overspeculated. 
This is the fundamental mechanism that self-perpetuates an asset bubble. Because the investors can not arbitrage with comparable assets, there is little chance many investors will pull out of the market while the value is rising because they do not have the option to diversify with non-bubbling assets in the same sector, so they would have to *fully* leave the market, thereby losing possible profits. This allows the value to be primarily decided by speculation. 
To clarify, I am not saying that BTC is not, or has never, been over-speculated. What I am saying that BTC does the fundamental properties that could cause an asset bubble. We should all be wary about over-speculation of Bitcoin. However we should not be looking at asset bubbles to explain the rise of Bitcoin, because that shows that we do not understand the fundamental properties of an asset bubble, what causes it, or how it grows.

Things have real value. It's just that their real value is different to each actor. Each actor also ranks products differently according to value. And each actor's perception of value is changing every day. I know it would be nice to apply consistent scientific laws to economics, but the fact of the matter is you can't. No matter how much data you've compiled, no matter how beautiful your math is, you simply cannot calculate value *objectively* or predict what the market will do, *scientifically*. We are not inert chemicals, but rational and irrational actors victim to a variety of emotions and trends.

The coming of Bitcoin will be a blessing to the working man. The fiat system allows for the wealthiest to be paid merely by the "quantitative" decreasing of the working man's purchasing power.

Haha, wow. Right now my comment has 2 upvotes, and yours has 12. Guess that means I did a shitty explanation. 
Once again,


Because it obviously [**fucking has**](
My post is not arguing that Bitcoin is/isn't speculative. It is whether or not it could be considered an economic "bubble". Remember words mean things and these words do *not* mean the same thing.
**Economic bubble:** ["trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values"]( It is when the price of a good is value more than it is *actually worth*.
To understand this issue we must ask the question: "What is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin?"
**Q:** What is intrinsic value?
**A:** Intrinsic value is defined as the actual value, rather than the market value, of something. Generally this is the value attached to an asset based upon its *fundamentals*: its expected growth, risk, future earnings etc. 
**Q:** Was the dotcom/housing bubble really a bubble?
**A:** Yes. In hindsight we can look back at the dotcom bubble and see that many of these internet companies were already losing money yet were getting millions of dollars in venture capitalism even though it was unlikely that this could be paid off. We can look at the dotcom bubble and say *fundamentally* that internet companies at the time, on average, did not have enough 'intrinsic' (possible future) value to pay off these investments. 
The housing bubble is even more obvious. Loans were given to investors who had *absolutely no way* to pay them back. These loans were justified because it was believed that homes would rise continually in value, even higher than what was affordable. What a pipe-dream.
**Ok**, let's look at Bitcoin.
**Q:** Well, what is Bitcoin really? 
**A:** Money. It fits all the credentials. Bitcoin can be used as a means of exchange, a unit of account, and as a store of value. It is durable (as much as the internet is), fungible (absolutely the most fungible/divisible currency ever), and portable (without a doubt the most portable currency ever).
**Q:** Well then, what is the value of money?
**A:** Good question. Obviously money has value, as a medium of exchange, and a store of value. If you want a number the total amount of currency worldwide (as measured in USD) is over $4 trillon! This is actually too conservative because it doesn't factor in precious metals, which by all accounts are just as money as fiat is.
**Ok.** Bitcoin is money. Money is worth over $4 trillion worldwide. So what is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin? 
If Bitcoin was the only currency used you could say its intrinsic value is $4 trillion. Of course, it isn't, which was the point of the original post. It is my position that to *accurately* gauge the intrinsic value of something it must be in a class in, and of, itself. *"Art Deco"* homes do not have intrinsic value, in and of themselves. A **home** (shelter from the elements), however, **is** intrinsically valuable. *Amazon.com* does not have an intrinsic value. Using the **internet** for business, however, *does* has intrinsic value. Likewise, *Bitcoin* does not have intrinsic value, it is **CURRENCY** that has intrinsic value.
**Q:** Well, is Bitcoin over-valued?
**A:** Maybe. All we can say is that the price of Bitcoin represents, as a whole, the market's idea about what value of Bitcoin *could be*.
**Q:** Is Bitcoin ***fundamentally*** over-valued?
**A:** **No**, hell ***no***, and hell fucking **NO**. Could Bitcoin eventually be worth more than $4 trillion? Yes. Could Bitcoin eventually be worth $0? Yes, and this is probably more likely. We **cannot** say *anything* about the fundamental value of Bitcoin, all we can talk about is the fundamental value of *currency*, which Bitcoin is just one of many. 
**Q:** Is Bitcoin a bubble?
**A:** No. A bubble **must collapse**. Sometimes this can only be seen in hindsight, but the fundamental property of a bubble is one that, by the intrinsic value of its fundamental properties, it *cannot* justify its market value. 
In hindsight we can see that the dotcom bubble *had* to pop, as these websites could not make back their investments. The housing bubble *had* to pop, because many investors could not pay back their loans. The speculation in these markets was entirely based upon future market value, and not the fundamental value of the market.
It is easy to see how Bitcoin could collapse. There could be a devestating 51% attack, a complete internet shutdown, a fundamental mathematical error in the hard-code, or it could be boxed out by a competing superior crypto-currency. 
But Bitcoin is *not* a bubble. Bitcoin does not *fundamentally* need to collapse because it is being priced above its intrinsic value. Rather, Bitcoin has the fundamental properties needed to be a worldwide currency, worth trillions of dollars; yet it could just as easily not even be worth the electricity needed to keep the network online.
* **tldr/conclusion:** As a Bitcoin enthusiast, and amateur economist, I want to clear up the misuse of the word "bubble" in the context of Bitcoin and speculation. All goods prices are the result of what sellers 'speculate' what buyers will spend, and what buyer's 'speculate' the good is worth to them. Sometimes goods can be over-priced, sometimes under-priced.  We can all agree that there is much speculation in the Bitcoin price, probably too much. We can all yearn for Bitcoin to be accepted by more industries, so the price will be less pegged on- speculation. 
* A *bubble*, however, is not just an example of "mere" speculation. It is the result of speculation that is *inherently* and *fundamentally* flawed. It is when the *market value* of a good is being speculated to a point that is **fundamentally** *without question* higher than what that good could be intrinsically worth. Although you may think Bitcoin is over-speculated, and over-valued, it should be obvious to most of us on this board that there is no *fundamental* reason that Bitcoin *must* fail. For this reason alone, **bitcoin is not a bubble**. 
* I hope that some of you learned something in this post. Many of you may think I'm just arguing semantics and wasting my time. I don't think it's a waste of time. Bitcoin's future relies on **us** to understand the market, it's potential, and it's risks; but more importantly to educate others on these issues. Skepticism is admirable. Skepticism that drives us to misuse words, make unjustified associations, or that leads us to false conclusions is **abhorrent**.

The average person **does** have a hard time paying for a house or a car without a loan *in the present system*. His dollars are worth less every day, ie prices are rising. Banks offer little to no interest for savings accounts. Putting money into investments is risky in the short term and hard to manage for an average guy.
*Bitcoin*, on the other hand, is a deflationary currency. This means, over time, saved Bitcoins rise in value, prices will fall. This makes it possible for people to save, and more unlikely they will make spur of the moment purchases. I predict this will lead to a drop in consumerism, and a return to higher quality products that people are willing to save for.

That's bad advice. I was just reading a thread the other day about a guy who has 75k in Bitcoin and got nervous last Thursday when the price plummeted. He sold at $75 (which turned out to be the bottom), and then it quickly rebounded to $90, bought back, lost $10k. I wouldn't recommend investing that much unless you are 100% sure about the fundamentals, the long term. If you're nervous it's better to wait until the price rises, sell off a little bit. Keep doing that you'll be making profit and also reducing your potential losses.

Imagine if Bitcoin was not a currency to be invested in, but rather a payment processing company. Lets say that one can invest in shares (of which there are 21 million). This company is providing a revolutionary product, that not only provides the faster processing than its competitors, it does so at a rate  that is impossible to compete with. It also provides merchants with protection against chargebacks, and sports **bullet-proof** identity theft protection for its users if used correctly. Let's also pretend this company's market cap was only $1 billion, while the competitors it threatened to upset had caps of over $10 - $100 billion. 
If this scenario was true, do you think it would be a good company to invest in?

**Seriously though:** Do not get into short-term investing with Bitcoin. The reason? I think it's because a huge percentage of Bitcoin investors are just like yourself; they want to win big on these huge price swings/gains that Bitcoin has recently had, but they don't have enough of an understanding of Bitcoin to see it as a long term investment. For this reason they are very jumpy about price drops, and are like to rush the "Bitbank" if they think it's crashing. These investors can be unpredictable and could cause a crash in the short-term price at, really, any arbitrary moment.
**The question is:** will you get scared if it looks like Bitcoin is crashing and sell as fast as you can so that you don't lose all your investment? Well then, **Congratulations**, you will likely lose money on your Bitcoin *gamble*. Please note I am not trying to discourage you. In fact us long-termers love you short-termers. You guys get really interested in Bitcoin after a big market rally, so we sell to you high and then you get scared during a dip and we'll buy them back at a discount.
**So...** should you heed my warning and not short-term invest? Seems reasonable. However, you have a better option. You are in the Promised Land of Bitcoin overflowing with Advice and Honey. Within these pages is enough information and links to build a comprehensive understanding of the Bitcoin system. Once you've done considerable lurking, ask questions about anything that you may still have doubts about.
At this point you must look inward and see if you are ready to make the next move; to surrender your soul to Bitcoin. If you are, then arise *brother*, and become a **Disciple** for Bitcoin, and begin your long-term investment in your new salvation.

Good point. I'm sure there's a lot of variance within homeless populations depending on your area though. Where I'm from the most common encounter that people have with "homeless" are people who stand on street corners with signs begging. Most of these people are physically/mentally fit and often young. I do not think it is a symptom of true impoverishment. I know many of them make a good buck out there, and some are not really "homeless". However, I do realize that there are many homeless are truly disabled but they stay out of the public's eye. A charity is a better method for them. Thank you for reminding me, Comms.

You don't invest that much capital and time into a business that you think has only a 20% chance of surviving (outside of your own fuckups).

That is a good point. Fiat currency is not guaranteed to collapse in our lifetimes, but I do believe that collapse will be death stroke of fiat eventually. Diversification is important. No one should keep all their eggs in the btc basket or the fiat basket. It is important to note that diversification among competing fiat currencies is not as diversified as it may seem. In today's financial realm as fiat is being printed by nearly all countries, it seems risky as a whole.

Nothing prevents this. This is a definite possibility. However an alternative cryptocurrency will have to be substantially superior to break the network support for Bitcoin. If a viable alt-currency rises, it's probably good advice to hedge some bets with it.

Bitcoin is what you would call a "binary" investment; either (a) your Bitcoins are going to make you rich in the long run or (b) they're going to zero. You might think that you've already hit it big time, but if Bitcoin does option (a) the markets it would disrupt could cause Bitcoins to be worth upwards of $tens-hundreds of thousands a piece. 
What you decide should be based off of serious consideration off all of Bitcoin''s fundamentals and an understanding of the current fiat system that Bitcoin threatens. Most of the subscribers on this subreddit believe in Bitcoin's long term potential and would probably recommend you hold. On the other hand it might be nice to take advantage of your newfound discovery especially if you have debt you would like to eliminate. But also keep in mind that your situation could very well be repeated by someone in 2016 who just remembered they bought $15 worth of Bitcoin when they were only worth $250 ;)

You can try and "create" as many Bitcoins as you want, but they would have to be accepted by 51% of the miners to be added to the blockchain. Which, of course, they won't do if you don't have the "proof of work" of solving a block to gain them.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:14:54
Yes. If only for the reason that it hasn't hit critical mass yet. What I mean is that the vast majority of people have not heard of, or are suspicious of, bitcoin. As these people trickle in the market the value rises. Bitcoin has a lot more to grow just by a wider user base.

@_date: 2013-03-29 03:00:38
Well... unless the volatility is *consistently* trending upwards (as Bitcoin has been recently). If you can convince yourself that the trend is going to continue I'd see that as much more preferable to stagnant value even with 5-15% daily variation.
But that's besides the point. There *are* a variety of metrics for defining a safe place for saving, but it is entirely up to you how you weigh these metrics against each other; how you define stability/volatility/growth, how much you think past trends will [*necessarily*]( predict future events, etc. 
The fact of the matter is that no matter which way you look at it all predictions about the future are necessarily subjective. We do not all have the same experiences/knowledge/beliefs and we will therefore all have a different opinion on what the future holds. And we cannot know all the variables. For instance I'm sure gold-holders in 1933 thought that gold was a great store of wealth not *predicting* that it would be confiscated by the US government just 6 months later.

Ok, I know you are correct technically, but obviously this is not being implied when people refer to Bitcoin speculation. While speculation is a broad term, in this sense it is being used to specify high-risk, high-return, short-period investments or shorts.

The important thing to realize is that Bitcoins are essentially "infinitely" divisible. There would never be a Bitcoin "shortage". A business should not mind whether it is charging 10 Bitcoins worth $100, or 1 Bitcoin worth $100.

Well I appreciate your earnestness and understand your doubt. But I think you may have made a technical misstep.


I think you may have been confused by the fact that the supply of Bitcoins are *finite* into believing they are not *infinitely divisible*. The fact of the matter is it doesn't matter how many Bitcoins are actually in circulation for Bitcoin to work. 21 million was just an arbitrary number, they could have picked 21 billion and it would've only meant that we would be trading at $0.13 per Btc. There is only one Bitcoin per 500 people on this planet, so if Bitcoin hit critical mass we will be making transactions in the hundredths or thousandths of Bitcoins.

One thing to consider my friend is that as the adoption of BTC grows there will be less control by the super-corrupt super-rich. 
The super-rich already have a banking system that is manicured to keep them rich. The Fed prints money and doles it out as corporate welfare to the super-rich. The most corrupt and ill-gotten wealth results as a function of fiat currency. 
Will Bitcoin help facilitate the super-rich? Yes. Bitcoin is so efficient it will even help those who the current banking system *already* caters to. But it will help the small guy out more. It will help the guy who does not have big friends in high places. It will help the guy who has his economic restricted by government intervention.

I don't feel sorry for him. It was a prime investment! Bitcoins were worth jack shit before then. His purchase of pizza was the first "physical world" purchase using Bitcoin. It was his actions that brought credence to Bitcoin as a currency and it skyrocketed soon afterward.
Also, his purchase was an "open offer" and he'd been a miner for a while so I highly doubt he spent all or even most of his stash. The rest of his stash probably skyrocketed in value thanks to his pizza purchase :)

I'm sorry but I don't see how it comes into play *at all*. Hoarding Bitcoins forever is the equivalent to losing your private keys. The **only** effect of hoarding/losing BTC is raising the relative value of a specific unit of BTC, but has no effect on the market cap. 
"Hoarding" BTC is not *at all* comparable to holding some sort of "resource". If someone hoarded a significant portion of the lumber in an area it would have a *definitive* effect on the construction industry. If someone hoarded coffee beans, it would have a negative impact on the coffee industry, etc.
This has *nothing* in common with hoarding BTC. If someone hoarded half the BTC that will ever exist it would have *no* effect on the market. It would be the equivalent of 10.5 million being the total BTC supply and not 21 million. The total number of BTC in existence is of no importance, rather it is your relative ownership of the total BTC in use.
EDIT: And if the whole point of this dialogue is that you're saying it'd be great if more people were involved in the BTC market, well, no one's arguing with you. 
I "hoard" the majority of my BTC. Though I prefer to use the word **SAVE**. Some of it I spend. I **fucking hate** the word "hoard". It's such a product of this credit-card debt society, that even "saving" your money is something negative. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:16:29
CPI is [*not*]( a good measure of inflation. The costs bore on every citizen is higher than 1%. The recession is also keeping inflation down. Without the federal reserve there would probably be *deflation* during a recession. So *any* increase in prices is evidence of manipulation.

I don't think they're inherently more vulnerable than other exchanges. I believe that MtGox was a one-man shoe-string operation when it was hacked two years ago.

You must realize that in a free market MtGox has a lot of incentive to keep security high to protect its place as the BTC-exchange gorilla. If MtGox were to release your personal data it would likely lose a lot of reputation and business.
That being said, it is a business in the US, and if it wants to remain as such it will have to follow government regulations. Therefore, I would not trust MtGox inherently. Nothing against it in particular, just the nature of the **Beast**.

The network effect is the positive effect that an increased user base has on something like Bitcoin. Take Facebook for example. Super popular, but wouldn't be worth shit if you were the only guy with an account. The same with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is valuable because many people find it valuable. The more people the greater the value! This is the reason that alt-currencies will have a harder time. Even if they are technologically superior to Bitcoin, they won't be valuable if very few accept it. Think how long Myspace lasted. That being said... increased acceptance of Bitcoin will increase acceptance of altcoins. It's not a bad idea to hedge some bets with altcoins.

They basically are providing the processing power that is running the network. They are the ones who build the blockchain, bitcoin's transaction log. They do this because about every ten minutes one of them gets 25 Btc as a reward. The more work they do the more likely they get the reward.

I was surprised at first too, but there's actually a fundamental reason for this. Transactions are only verified when a miner cracks a block (on average every ten minutes). Even so, this block may be reversed so this does not mean that the transaction is actually permanent. However, with every new block mined it becomes exponentially less likely that previous blocks will ever be reversed.
For this reason many companies/exchanges to not show that the transaction has gone through until this window has passed. The rule of thumb is that after ~6 blocks it is virtually impossible that a block will be reversed. 6 blocks takes about an hour, so this explains the lengthy transaction times.
**Note**: The reason that MtGox has instantaneous transactions is because they are not actually updating the blockchain. Rather they are only updating internal records of who owns how much BTC. The Blockchain would only need to be updated if you deposited/withdrew from MtGox.

Paper bitcoins are a synch to create. There are a few out there who are creating some pretty nifty tamperproof ones. I think its likely that some variant of these will be used to facilitate paper transfer.

@_date: 2013-03-13 01:33:04


I know they're aware of it, but its really a small player right now. Bitcoin's entire market cap is equivalent to what the Fed prints every 5 hours. It *will* become an issue when it gets bigger, have no doubt.
 &gt;It's legal now, but with a currency the government has no control on, what action if any would/can the government take to regulate or shut down Bitcoins?
Honestly? Little to nothing. When has the government ever been good at banning something? Bitcoin runs the same way that torrent software does, and the gov has tried its damnedest to shut that down to no avail. They could restrict its growth by forcing US businesses to deny Btc payments, but they could never confiscate your Btc or truly stop Bitcoin trade.


**It makes it incredibly more secure.** Because there is no central bank that can artificially create Bitcoins, you can be rest assured that your Bitcoins cannot be arbitrarily devalued for political gain.


The miners are securing/insuring the integrity of the Bitcoin network. They are who validates transactions, check for double spending and bring new Btc into the system. The more miners/computer power devoted to Bitcoin, the more secure the entire system.


Speculation. Concerns over security/legality. The fact that there are very few players who are day trading so a small volume can greatly influence the price.


I see it being a **major** player. You can make money on the exchanges, but each particular currency is guaranteed to be devalued in the long run. Not so with Bitcoin. It is produced to a finite amount, and therefore cannot be devalued by arbitrary Btc creation. It is also fraud-proof and has incredibly fast international transaction time.


I don't know, but I think if there was the price would be a lot more than $50/Btc. 


Because some anonymous guy on the internet told you to, lol. Honestly, this forum is a treasure trove that cannot be rehashed in one blurb.

@_date: 2013-05-16 05:40:11
Why do you think that we would be defenseless without a state? Most of the reason we *can't* defend ourselves from the individual criminal is because of state. The state has restricted our individual ability to protect ourselves with gun control and opposition to private police firms, under the "promise" that their Statute Enforcement Soldiers (police) will be better protection. Do not be fooled. The SES works for the state not us. 
This may be a shock to you, but we are not free. We are enslaved by the government. Don't believe me? Try not paying taxes. If you wait long enough some men with costumes and weapons will kidnap and you and put you in a cage. 
You may think "that's not slavery, I get to keep *most* of my money". Well at what tax percentage does it become slavery? 50%? 75%? 90%? Remember income tax is only a ^^^small percentage of how much the state is *really* taxing you. You have sales taxes, tariffs, regulations that add costs to business, the taxing of the value of your dollar through inflation... 
Whatever the percentage is we are that much enslaved to the state. The government *purposely* does not take all of it. Over time states realized that they got better return on their assets (us) by unlocking our chains and giving us economic freedom, in return for a cut. It turns out that humans are *far* more productive when they believe themselves free, and the taxes on their productivity greatly outstrip that of pure servitude. 
Once the state is gone the vast majority of *all* crimes disappear. That's not to say we all become peace-loving hippies however. There may still be need for private defense and security firms but the majority of defense will be probably on and individual level now that we'd have an unhampered right to protect ourselves/family/property. There's actual been some real theory developed on how security and private defense might look like in a voluntary society. I strongly recommend this [video]( if you're interested.

The more people hoard it, the more the value increases :) Bitcoin has amazing utility as a currency as well as an asset, and non-hoarded Btc will be used as such. The less in liquid currency the higher the value of that currency. Supply down, price up!
@_date: 2013-03-05 15:30:52
This boom is unstable, but not to the degree of the last one. If you think about the value of Btc in general it either one of two things: 
**1.** Used as a tool, specifically as a currency. Btc represents the value of the goods and services being traded with it. 
**2.** As a speculative commodity, betting on its future use as a viable currency. 
Both of these values of Btc are important to determine its worth, but only the 2nd is violently unstable. It is impossible to say how much of the current value is tied to speculation alone, but it is probably quite high. 
What is doubtless though is that far more of the currency is being used for actual transactions for goods and services than two years ago. 
Examples: { bitcoinstore.com, bitmit.com, growth of SR, online companies accepting btc for payment, etc.} 
The value tied to speculation is all that could collapse. The value tied to trade should be unchanged. Assuming that all the vendors have their prices pegged to USD, and not to btc, the effect on their businesses after a collapse should be negligible. 
Bitcoin is far more secure than it was two years ago.

Because at the time you buy there is virtually no difference to you whether you buy in USD or BTC, because you can switch them at the exchange rate. It costs *no more* to purchase with BTC than it would be to purchase with USD. If you purchase with USD you are doing that *instead* of converting it to BTC, so the difference is negligible.
That being said I prefer to purchase with BTC for privacy reasons.

Not true, my friend. USD and Bitcoin are competing commodities, specifically as a medium of exchange. As the value of one goes up, the value of the other goes down. If I exchanged $100 USD for Bitcoin the supply of USD goes up (my $100) and the demand goes down (I don't want it anymore). Supply up, demand down, value down.

I said **exactly the opposite** of that. Only by government (centralized) edict could the internet/electricity be shut down. There is **absolutely no *fucking way* an electricity/internet company would shut itself down.** 
Why? Because they have a problem with demand? People may cut back on electricity/internet but I guaran*fucking*tee you that internet (and especially electricity) will two of the *last* things people want to give up. 
Maybe a problem with supply? **Yeah right**. You do realize that most of the price of internet and electricity goes to paying off their sunk costs, like laying cable or building power lines? The *actual* cost of transmitting electricity and data, *once the infrastructure is already there*, is *extremely* low. 
Don't just *assume* shit. I don't know who put it in your head that a GFC would be anything like a zombie apocalypse, but that's just plain wrong.

Its unlikely that the steady increase in government power will be fixed by the government in this life or the next. To change our system there must be a snap in our cognitive dissonance. For my part I *do* try to live my life as I please, however it is difficult as the government has intruded on most aspects of life. I also think its important to have *conversations* with people (that are a little deeper than the weather). I find that its extremely beneficial to talk to people and get their opinions and explanations. Usually you'll find that they hadn't thought about the government or its justification before. 
For some reason (public school system, commercialized media, internet, or another) few Americans have strong critical thinking skills. They are not lost, only buried. By dialoging our friends and family you help hone theirs and yours.

I understand your frustration. I would not recommend putting all your savings in BTC because there's always the chance the bottom could fall out.
That being said... Bitcoin is naturally deflationary and has only tapped a small portion of its possible market. If all the bitcoins available right now were split among all the people of the world evenly there would be only 0.0015 BTC/person. The fact that you can buy 1 BTC for &lt; $100 is pretty incredible considering its potential. If you had put $5k into BTC at the start of this year you could pretty much have paid off that debt. 
Now I know hindsight is 20/20 and I don't want you to take this as a whole-hearted recommendation. What you should do is look at Bitcoin's fundamentals and its potential. Then invest something you can afford to lose. Heck just invest in *1* Bitcoin!

I would say an unequivocal **yes** if we lived in any previous time. Precious metals have historically been a great store of value. For the first time in human history I think precious metals may lose much of their utility as a store of value.
The first threat I see is Bitcoin, (or some other cryptocurrency). If enough goldbugs decide that Bitcoin is a better store of value, or to diversify with bitcoin, gold will drop in value proportional to this fall in demand. I do not say this *will* happen but it definitely is a possibility
The next big threat, and it *is* big, is the very probable chance that asteroids will be mined for precious metals in the semi-near future. I know this sounds sci-fi lol, but it is a real [thing]( Now that may be many years out, but it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that asteroids have *many* times the amount of precious metals that earth does, considering the fact that all precious metals on earth *came* from asteroids.
Now, you may be convinced that cryptocurrency is not a threat and asteroid mining will never happen and if you come to that conclusion more power to you. There's no way to know for sure until that day comes. We *are* talking about the future here.
