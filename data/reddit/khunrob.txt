Then why did this exact scenario you are describing not happen in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016?

You pay tax based on residency, not location of your bank account

seems to only be true for holders and not anyone trading

Not until something is done about the problem. Even the PineappleFund charity said they got their donations stuck
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:32:45
any official source on this?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:54:14
which is exactly what some people have been saying for YEARS but nobody listened... BCH would never exist if they had
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:36:37
It is.

Who the hell are you to decide what it's about? half of the worlds population should be priced out of the market? is that what you think?
I must have read the wrong whitepaper because I thought it said something about being a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and not only a wealth storage system for the top 1%
If the point of bitcoin is to be a currency, it needs to be usable. Yes, also for buying coffees.

I don't get why he thinks that... To me it seems like BCH supporters want 2x to fail.

Do you have any idea how hard it is to break your tax residence from most developed EU countries? Really fucking hard, and it often takes several years to do it as well.
If you are a US citizen, then it is pretty much impossible
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:05:54
You can't be serious?

there is no source on Malta being tax-free, and for Portugal it was tax free only if you are not professionally trading (daytrading I guess)
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:04:31


that's not true at all
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:43:57
this :(

Emergent Consensus support = 41.6 %, activation threshold = 75 %
Segwit Support = 32.7 %, activation threshold = 95 %
Who is blocking who again?
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:39:58
The argument is that segwit is not equal to a 2mb increase in non-witness data, no matter which way you twist the words.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:11:40
Yeah I don't disagree with you, it's sad that this is what it has come to.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:00:56
I never said anything about wanting that? I also never said anything about what scaling option I prefer. 
I'm just tired of fucking idiots like you saying that hard forks are always dangerous, or claiming that only segwit is the same thing as segwit + 2mb that was agreed in the HK agreement

No point trying to talk sense to this sub full off brainwashed sheep who think miners are "the bad guys"
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:29:06
or perhaps it is you who should take a look at the bitcoin whitepaper if you don't understand why it is the hashrate that matters
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:09:37
Stop repeating the same bs. SegWit is not 2mb and there is nothing dangerous about a 2mb hard fork
