My thoughts on a UASF: The community is open to it but it’s still a very new idea. I personally think it’s a good idea, but want to emphasize that the change needs to be well planned and publicized in advance, and it needs to be unhackable.
What’s important about a UASF is that all the exchanges need to be onboard. So every user needs to write their exchange and let them know that this is what they want. We can fight for a UASF but if it ends up being hugely unpopular we should recognize that we shouldn’t do it.
I think a UASF is a great idea in terms of the social aspect of it. Nodes ultimately buy bitcoins from miners so nobody can really deny the right of nodes to select which 12.5BTC reward they want to buy, a Segwit or non-Segwit one. The miners against Segwit will lose less face because after all, this is what they’re being paid for.
It’s better than a PoW change and we should try it before a PoW change.

LN itself is open source so anyone, including miners themselves, can compete to be an LN hub. Worries that LN will lead to fractional reserve banking are delusional; every Lightning payment is a potential on-chain tx so secret fractional reserves are impossible.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:22:08
He's right. New demand = higher fees. Lightning on-boards users who wouldn't otherwise use bitcoin.
Existing bitcoin users won't switch over, the fees aren't a problem for them and they don't want to lock up their funds in some channel, they want to use bitcoin like they've always done.
To Jihan Wu: I am willing to personally make a $100,000 bet with you (or anybody who cares) that instead of decreasing, on-chain fees will **increase** at a **faster** pace once Lightning is up and running. We can be public about this, refine the terms and put it in a multi-sig escrow, etc. I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is... What do you say?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:24:20
Agreed. Core not against an HF as evidenced by their [BitcoinHardForkResearch]( work - I see them as neutral. Hopefully when there is more Segwit adoption months down the road we will be able to justify an HF blocksize increase.
The truth is, no business likes the high fees. The block size definitely can and should be increased and I believe Core will listen to reason once the Segwit-dependent improvements that have been **stalled for years,** come to fruition.
Segwit will justify a block size increase. **But not for now.**
Devs need to get to work - lightning must come sooner. The dark net is already shifting to multiple currencies - bitcoin will lose its edge unless bitcoin developers put out improvements at a fast pace.
In particular - Whether by lightning or some other method - The fees cannot be this high forever. We must redouble our efforts on lightning networks.
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:30:49
Both sides are definitely trying very hard to promote their cause. I just think Roger is misguided- Segwit and Lightning would actually bring low fees/high tx volume to Bitcoin exactly like he wants. Hard forking to change the block size, even if "successful" (it won't be), won't give either of these. Hilariously, Roger stands to benefit more from Segwit than anybody else.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:26:24

Anyone can be stubborn and most people are.
It takes intelligence, humility, and character to be able to change your mind. People who are able to change their mind have my highest respect. There is nothing more noble than making sacrifices (like losing face, etc) in order to do the right thing.
But honestly, Roger stands to make billions on Segwit, it's ridiculous. I realize this is something that his haters are jealous of and don't like to point out but it's the truth. It should make the decision a little easier :)

Subsidizing tx fees with bigger blocks comes at the cost of centralization.
Miners themselves may benefit over the short term with bigger blocks, but over the long term everybody loses, including miners, when bitcoin fails due to the increased centralization.
Again, Lightning is the only way to solve the fee problem once and for all.

- Community support for 2x is [simply not there]( all the big blockers have migrated to Bitcoin Cash.

Miners are not in charge of bitcoin.
And giving them the sole power to vote on block size forever makes no sense, of course they'll vote to give themselves more money and power.
Bitcoin has always had a limit of 21 million coins to be **mined.** Should we allow miners to vote on increasing that limit as well?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are zero businesses outside of miners/pools and Rogers' that support Bitcoin Unlimited.

I think over time miners will see the benefit of activating Segwit. We just need to emphasize the innovation it brings and the dangers of a contentious hard fork which is what BU is.
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:31:38
Funny, but this isn't a serious concern. Just looking through coinmarketcap there's already BitcoinDark and BitcoinPlus; alts won't automatically gain traction if they have Bitcoin in their name. Besides, Bitcoin Cash has a good reason for existing.
Inflation is not inherently evil- in fact, when done like Bcash, it has a net zero effect; maybe positive.
Inflation is only bad when certain privileged groups get to use the new money first- like the banks/military-industrial complex in today's Federal Reserve system.
But chain splits give the same amount of coins to everybody- so everybody's % of the total money supply stays the same.
Which makes this type of inflation the exact same as if nothing had happened.
The truth is: no real value was "printed" in the Bcash fork- if it never happened BTC would simply be at the BTC+BCH value today.
Deflation is okay too if everyone's coins decrease by the same %. Of course the simplest method is 0% inflation which is what bitcoin will be in the end.
Inflation as it is today is just another way for the government cronies to steal; for instance, your stocks could be increasing for **no other reason** than monetary inflation, yet the government taxes you on your capital gains!

Correct me if I'm wrong but Roger's paying miners a significant premium out of his own pocket to mine at his pool. He also pays for retweets on Twitter. So Bitcoin Unlimited's hashrate and popularity may be exaggerated due to the financial incentives that this one very rich, very connected individual provides to support it.
This distortion of financial incentives may be the reason why Segwit "support" is lacking when measured in some ways. However, around 60% of full nodes and almost 100% of devs support Segwit which is encouraging.
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:17:54
These are the kinds of reasons miners shouldn't be running low quality code like BU!
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:36:07
If the 2x fork goes through there will be 3 bitcoins- this much brand dilution is not good for anybody. We must make prudent, practical decisions- decisions like Segwit, which has brought the price of bitcoin to all-time highs. When I started posting on r/bitcoin months ago the price was $900!
Let's focus on the long-term future of bitcoin rather than short-term alleviation of political pressures- letting devs work to give bitcoin the foundation to last for centuries. Precedents are important- What kind of precedent does it set if miners unilaterally ram the fork through?
2x at this point in time is not necessary. The NYA was supposed to prevent a chain split but Jihan and Antpool/ViaBTC went ahead with Bitcoin Cash anyway; which doesn't violate the fine print of the agreement, just like Core technically [never violated]( the HK agreement- but **the spirit of the compromise has been broken.**
It's not a bad thing- in fact, **Jihan has found a [better path]( forward.** [Big]( blockers [and]( hard [forkers]( like [Bitcoin Cash]( better [than 2x]( it's [all r/btc]( and Roger Ver talk about- they promote Bitcoin Cash over bitcoin every chance they get- coverage has saturated news.bitcoin.com already and big blockers don't want anything to do with bitcoin anymore, much less 2x it!
To all businesses and miners supporting the 2x fork- you should be [supporting BCH instead]( It has more devs, you'd be doing [more for your cause]( it's what [every big blocker wants]( it's where all the passion is.
I want to [help the big blockers]( so this is what I am doing.
Let's keep ourselves ahead of Ethereum- we need unity and practical decisions, not stubborness. While I am a believer in bitcoin, it may not be impossible for speculation to cause Ethereum to overtake bitcoin.
If you're an NYA signee that doesn't like postponing 2x- that's okay! It's a natural reaction (cognitive dissonance); I urge you to give it some time &amp; sleep on it a week- what difference does it make :) **Let's get even richer, together.**

2x [since inception]( has been [riddled]( with [poor code]( and bugs- it should at the very least be postponed for a year+ or until we have clear consensus on the changes.
Again, **Core is not against a hard fork blocksize increase** - just the [timeline and politics]( of it. It doesn't help that 2x development can't attract manpower- right now Garzik is just copying everything off the Core branch and even then he's far behind.
**I am not against a hard fork- I just think it's best to shelf it for a year or so;** and maybe put in some things from the [Hard Fork Wish List]( while we're at it, maybe a dynamic increase.
Bitcoin developers are [unanimous]( in declaring that 2x is not good for the network... We should pay attention to this.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:01:54
A fork to 2mb right now will still give high tx fees, nothing would change. Instead of 20 cents they'd be like 15 cents, big whoop. Then they'd be back to 20 in no time.
There's simply too much demand in the world for a liquid censorship resistant asset like bitcoin.
The days of cheap on-chain fees are over no matter how big the block size. Nothing will give low fees except Lightning.
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:58:49
I disagree with this. Capacity increases may lower fee income in the very very very short term but it wouldn't take long for the space to fill up.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:07:00
Yeah, the argument that bigger blocks will lower fees is unfounded.
I can guarantee the extra space will instantly be filled. In bitcoin's current state, people hoping for cheap fees will be outbid over and over again.
For better or worse, cheap fees on-chain are gone forever.

Segwit, an undeniable benefit for the network, was languishing at 30% miner support for a year until I came along and tipped the scales, igniting a bull run for bitcoin in the process. As the leader of the dark net and first dark net politician, I gave Segwit to bitcoin on a whim by being an early backer of BIP148.

Be it Segwit or different soft-fork, something needs to be done about the ASICBOOST problem. Bitmain **physically built** ASICBOOST into the circuitry of their chips, they've got a patent on it, they've used it on testnet, they're mining empty blocks (an indication of covert ASICBOOST), it has the potential to make them an extra $100 million a year yet they claim they've never used it in production?
Along with **only** supporting hard fork and extension block proposals which are structured in such a way to continue to allow the possibility of ASICBOOST?
Smells fishy! I agree with Andreas here- if they aren't using ASICBOOST at all then why are they opposed to a code change that eliminates its covert use?
Remember, no one wants to stop public, plain, **overt** ASICBOOST; it's the sneaky, suspicious, **covert** form we're talking about here.
The main problem with ASICBOOST is that it requires the block header to have the same form forever, **thus preventing important updates to Bitcoin.**
The good news is, by separating the signatures in the block, Segwit by itself will make covert ASICBOOST impossible.
I have never been more confident in Segwit and the Core developers than today. Let's activate Segwit; then re-evaluate the possibility of raising the block size.
@_date: 2017-04-25 02:29:46
Agreed. And at this point, to use censorship as an excuse for BU's lack of support is laughable. Everyone and their dog knows about BU now... Censorship does not excuse incompetent software rife with bugs and no devs. As for BU itself, it's clear now that it is antithetical to Bitcoin; it even has a [governance structure]( that allows for a President of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-04-25 02:33:50
It irritates me that big blockers blame the current stagnation on Core when they consistently put out quality code. Nobody should be blaming Core developers for anything; and with respect to consensus changes Core devs don't have any power at all... they can propose consensus changes but ultimately it's the users of Bitcoin that back them. Case in point- they have written numerous [hard-fork proposals]( but none have gained traction among the users. Where are the hard fork proposals from Gavin or Mike Hearn?
@_date: 2017-04-25 02:37:34

Scaling on-chain forever is clearly unfeasible; the end scenario would be something like 5 nodes in the whole world.
On the other hand, scaling via lightning networks makes sense. From an end user's standpoint, it would be like a checking account (LN) vs a savings account (on-chain).
There's no way around it: although each LN tx can be an on-chain tx, depending on how small your LN transaction is, if in the future your LN hub breaks down or there is another dispute, there's a chance that your money will never be returned to you on-chain due to the high on-chain fees. (For instance, if your LN tx was $50 but on-chain fees are $100, then your LN tx will never settle on-chain).
There is no way around this. It is, however, better than paying a lawyer at $1000 an hour to take the case to court!
So, lightning networks are not perfect. But think of the on-chain fee as lawyer fees; I'd much rather pay $100 to settle a case, than actually sue somebody!
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:58:06

BU is so clearly incompetent that you have to question the motives of its supporters.
This is the [third time]( that BU nodes have crashed- unacceptable for code securing $20 billion. (Most of BU's code is forked from Core, meaning that the bug density in what **little** code BU devs wrote, must be astronomical!)
So, people like Ver and Jihan who push BU as production-ready, are doing so for political reasons. Behaving politically means that they are arguing for their chosen solution without revealing their true intentions.
I believe truth is good, so I'm going to address what I think is a strong undercurrent in the debate: hard forks and the 21 million bitcoin limit.
BU's mission is a hard fork at all costs. Segwit is a compromise; it offers a 2x blocksize increase yet BU supporters don't want it solely because it doesn't come with a hard fork.
I believe hard forks set a dangerous precedent because they threaten bitcoin’s deflationary nature; a hard fork can change bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit- its most sacred economic parameter. Gavin and Mike Hearn have both [publicly said]( that they believe the block reward should be indefinite. This is worrisome in my eyes: they want to hard fork the 21 million limit out...
Never in history has there been an asset more deflationary than bitcoin; this is a unique aspect of bitcoin, a selling point and something we should never change. There are many inflationary assets in the world and bitcoin should not be trying to be like them.
This is the main reason I am against hard forks where possible- precedents only make it easier to build up to forking the 21 million out. A second reason is that hard forks don’t involve consent- users who don't agree with the new rules are kicked off the network. On the other hand, soft forks **do not** force changes upon users; with a soft fork nodes do not have to upgrade and old nodes still work. This is why we should soft fork over hard whenever possible- it is opt-in.
Even if the entire community agreed on a hard fork (which will never happen before Segwit), it would take **2 years** for a hard fork to be coded, tested and rolled out properly- whereas Segwit is available **now**!
So, I favor soft forks both philosophically and practically. The practical argument on its own is enough to persuade most of my peers to agree with me.
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:23:47
Yep- Haters are a fact of life. This is what happens when you become a person of influence; you can’t make everyone like you. I urge r/bitcoin to ignore hate, drama, emotions, and focus instead...
On the technicals.
I am a technologist. Technology is good because of the [reversal-test]( I promote retail multi-sig because it’s better technology, and has profound implications for changing business and society for the better. With multi-sig, third-party exit scams have been **eliminated** under good implementations, and made [byzantine-fault tolerant]( under bad implementations.
For instance, in the future multi-sig may prevent people like Trump from “sort-of” exit scamming: e.g., taking loans from investors, then using the vagueness of court law to purposefully default on debt while pocketing millions! Multi-sig lowers third party abuse of trust, like *trusting* our government *not* to print (debt-based!) money in order to fund wars, or other unethical things.
Bitcoin, as an asset and collectible like gold, is different from the debt-based money of governments. The Fed [literally]( prints new money, and allows banks to lend this new money (so when returned, the banks get the free money back WITH interest!). This corrupt, trickle-down scheme has other outlets: the military-industrial complex, federal boondoggles like Solyndra; they get to spend the new money first, before its trickled-down to the rest of the economy and prices have inflated!
Who knows what’s behind the curtain? Our corrupt-from-the-base financial system **leeches** off real economic growth. The [regulatorily captured]( Fed’s strategy has always been to leech and inflate just barely enough so that the real growth from the next technological boom saves them (the last time was the dot-com boom).
Everybody would be working 6 hour weeks if it weren’t for the banks’ monopolization of the money supply! Instead, we’re stuck waiting for the Fed to exit scam like they did in ’08 ([$16 trillion exit scam]( **in secret**), causing another recession... like they have every time in the past!
[The income tax was established in 1913]( the same year the Fed was chartered. Coincidence?
Obviously, banking is not inherently evil, as humanity has needed banks to get to where we are today. However, new **technology** enables new options.
Bitcoin, fortunately, is an asset-based money. Coins are not minted from nothing; miners have to pay for the electricity to mine bitcoin. Thus there is free-market competition for the **production** of money, as well as a free-market for spending.
@_date: 2017-04-25 02:28:03
There is no real opposition against Core outside of Reddit, such as IRC and dev mailing lists. So BU kind of reminds me of global warming- almost 99% of scientists (devs) are in one camp, whereas the other camp is mostly anti-intellectuals and conspiracy theorists.
We can debate Satoshi's intentions all we want, but he didn't have perfect knowledge of bitcoin (nobody does). What we do know is that he set the limit to 1MB and never changed it back despite being able to. Actions are more important than words, so why speculate as to "what he really wanted"? He left the project without changing the limit, is this not the truest indication of what he actually thought?

We have a choice to make. Do we want a cheap-fee Paypal-like network, or a decentralized network? 
Because we cannot have both on the main chain.
We can build Paypal 2.0 on a side-chain in a second layer, **above** a first, decentralized layer.
But all existing crypto knowledge, tells us **we cannot simultaneously have both on the first layer.**
Often in life, we are fortunate enough to have abundance- to be able to share.
But sometimes, we must [recognize]( incompatibility.

r/btc is so [willing to lie]( and deceive to further their agenda. We cannot support these people who never actually address the technical arguments. I have been more than reasonable in arguing my position, along with the pro-Segwitters, yet they repeat, and respond with more lies.
It’s impossible to work with these people, of whom a sizable portion lie to drive their make-believe narrative.
Core, on the other hand, does not lie.

It’s just Art of the Deal, Trump-style negotiation. Ask for something totally off-the-wall like Emergent Consensus, then settle at what you really want. Support anti-privacy, [anti-freedom]( Mike Hearn, just to further your own agenda.
Anti-Segwitters hardly ever say what they mean and mean what they say... unlike Core, who are far more honest.
The hilarious thing is, both Ver and Jihan are set to make billions on Segwit... whereas with BU they would lose their fortune. We are literally fighting to make them richer.
Soft fork Segwit, then development of a hard fork. Which again, I will fund. Anti-Segwitters win with this deal- and should be happy they aren't getting UASF'd!
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:07:04
I like the spirit of this "compromise" but there will need to be a full code release, no bugs before I can support this. Also, involved parties have [different interpretations]( of the agreement... so it comes across as a stalling tactic. If it is, we will see Jihan move the goalposts again and deviate from this agreement.
Only if BIP148 fails, would I support this "compromise." I would support both Alex Petrov's and Jihan's interpretation, but not Ver's.
Segwit is bit 1, but this proposal uses bit 4. So if Segwit is changed or adulterated in any way I also would not support this.
Changing the bit requires a lot of engineering work- so is it possible that we can use [BIP91]( and add the 2MB hard fork to it programmatically? This sounds like the perfect solution, if it can be done.
Lastly, if we're going to hardfork, some items from the [wishlist]( would probably help it gain support.

Money laundering is like the war on drugs- just another power grab for the government and the banks, who want to implement negative interest rates with their war on cash- another mechanism to hurt the poor and the oppressed, while letting the rich get off scot free!
Because why would the regulators take on their wealthy buddies doing all the real laundering, when they can make targets out of the poor and middle class instead? It's much easier to prey on the underprivileged- they can't afford lawyers and court fees, they can't fight back and they definitely don't have the bribe money to grease their palms!
If the government **really** wanted to do something about money laundering, they'd be going after guys like Trump, buying and selling casinos... and refusing to release his tax returns because he’s laundered so much!
But of course, the laundering Trump does pales in comparison to what our own government is engaged in.

We must learn from the failed Hong Kong agreement, and start respecting the sanctity of mutual agreements. As I understand it, miners broke the agreement first by signalling Classic, so that crap needs to stop.
And Core must recognize its own severe faults and improve. It must be made explicitly clear (and not just in the fine print) from now on, that Core cannot negotiate for the users. Core cannot promise a successful hard fork (or soft fork) without backing from the users. The latter two sentences must be the first two sentences of **all** agreements Core makes with outside parties from now on.
Agreements must also account for any possible future developments, no matter how improbable. It is my understanding that we didn't know how to do Segwit as a soft fork at the time of the agreement. We all know crypto moves fast... So from now on, **every possible** innovation or development must be accounted for in agreements, and what potential actions to take in each case.
It is clear that Core did not think things through. Appearance is meaningful. The Hong Kong agreement was an extraordinary diplomatic failure and going forward, nothing like it must ever happen again.

[Everybody]( wants Segwit except a [couple of miners](
Jihan is using manipulative strategies to divide the pro-Segwit side. Blame high fees on pro-Segwitters yet Lightning, which comes with Segwit is the **only** cure for high fees... Mine empty blocks which have room for thousands of transactions, so he can offer tx accelerators that accelerate only a hundred at a time!
It's like the Fed creating the booms then doing bailouts after the bust... It's "solving" a problem that was self-manufactured in the first place.

As I have said, **I will fund** and advocate for a hard fork block size increase proposal after Segwit (with the flag day to be 1 year or less after Segwit activation. Rushed, IMO, but if the anti-Segwitters want this, I'll do it.)
If you are opposed to Segwit because you think it somehow means we won't further increase the block size in the future: you are mistaken.
It's the exact opposite: Segwit will **justify** bigger blocks- it will give us data-backed reasons to increase the block size to an optimal limit or rate increase without sacrificing too much decentralization. We'll have to see its effects on the node count, but I am sure that popular sentiment will lead to another block size increase after Segwit.
There's just no point in blindly raising the block size, before Segwit.

I support this proposal, I will support any proposal as long as Segwit is activated before or at the same time as a hard fork. However, I can't see how the compromise can get any fairer- and more workable- than this.

I do not judge any of Bitmain's business partners, however, **it is near 100% likely that Bitmain is in cahoots with the Chinese government.**
Large companies like Bitmain, headquartered in Beijing, do not exist in China without government involvement. And make no mistake: the government has set its sights on bitcoin- after all, **who wouldn't want control** of a ticking time bomb for the financial systems of the world?
The Chinese government has shown this. They recently put out bitcoin regulation, they've met with Chinese exchanges, there is no way they are not fully aware of bitcoin and its impending worldwide impact.
In the US, money is power- but in China, power is power. Jihan's hands are tied and this situation is not his fault. Even from a profits standpoint, it's irrational for Bitmain to be against Segwit; the profits from bitcoin appreciation should far exceed even ASICBOOST profits.
**For me, I am against 100% control of Bitcoin being handed to any single country, China or otherwise.** Trusted third parties are [security holes]( and never good for bitcoin long-term. Avoiding this type of attack on bitcoin is so important that Satoshi spent most of the white paper discussing it.
Bitmain and BU cannot be fully trusted and their recent actions have demonstrated this. Antbleed left me dumbfounded- it is either astounding incompetence or far more likely, the intentional planting of an exploit. Either way, we should respond as if it were a [malicious attack.](
Segwit, on the other hand, is technically robust, completely [backward compatible]( and has the [full support]( of the ecosystem.
And after Segwit fixes the quadratic scaling of sighash operations problem, the block size can be increased with less risk. To the hard forkers: why increase the block size before Segwit when you can get a bigger increase after it?
We must scale responsibly and this means utilizing data-driven decisions.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:18:54
The high fees and delays are outrageous and Bitcoin is losing market share to alts. Miners need only activate Segwit for immediate relief from congestion; almost every wallet provider and business in the space is [ready for it](
So the very situation Jihan and Ver complain about is the one they're instigating!
The price of bitcoin will probably need to drop before we see any [meaningful action]( from the miners.

@_date: 2017-05-17 07:19:30
Thank you for writing this guide. Can you do one for BIP149?
I am personally in favor of BIP149 over BIP148, as it doesn't involve initiating a chain split. The goal is to avoid disruption; if UASF proponents force a chain split then it's really no better than a hard fork. Worse, actually- a UASF failure could be bad in terms of public perception- I would prefer doing a UASF only once and succeeding, rather than attempting it multiple times.
With BIP149, **the miners, not the economic nodes, would be the ones initiating a chain split.** It's a small difference, but crucial.
Bitcoin was designed to favor the status quo- the "default" consensus; so BIP148 is needlessly aggressive and likely to fail IMO.
We need to use the status quo to our advantage and BIP149 does this.
We should continue to pay high fees rather than force a chain split.
This line of reasoning is also why I'm not too concerned about a hard fork from the anti-Segwitters; a hard fork by definition guarantees a chain split with the hard forkers as the aggressors- again, status quo has a huge advantage in Bitcoin so any such hard forks are likely to fail. And we'd get the publicity boost from the failure.
**A hard fork would be likely to succeed only after Segwit** (there'd be no "reason" to block it anymore).
**BIP149 will take 8 months to come to fruition- so this is going to take some time.**
I have stopped signalling for BIP148.
Please correct me if my understanding of the situation is incorrect.

It seems like I had some mistaken assumptions about BIP148/149.
I will support **both** the BIP148 UASF, and the Segwit + hard fork after 1 year proposal, as put forth by Barry. Since they both have a chance of causing disruption.
One thing that I think should be emphasized: these are not mutually exclusive, **in fact they work better together.** Barry can get UASF Segwit with his miner support.
**Regardless of how soft fork Segwit is activated: my personal commitment to fund a hard fork proposal afterward, still stands.**
During times of disruption, you need the economic majority and this means exchanges and businesses. Of crucial importance is the way the chain split is presented- with a hard fork, most exchanges will probably list both chains as they’ll want to make money off trading both. With a UASF, I’m not so sure. If it looks contentious, businesses with no strong opinions will probably shut down initially as the market determines which chain is worth more.
Don’t expect changes in community consensus to happen fast. It’s going to take a while to get the word out and convince everybody, but we have till August 1st for the BIP148 UASF. This is plenty of time if we all advocate for it, and write to our exchanges and business partners in support of it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:47:36
Immediately after the activation of Segwit I will start a fund- I will put in $75k of my own money to fund [additional development]( of a hard fork, with a simple block size increase. No Emergent Consensus.
Because if we are to hard fork, I want the highest quality code possible.
We should try Segwit before a hard fork. Again I reiterate: Segwit is available to us **now**, with a [block-size increase]( whereas a hard fork will take **years** to prepare for.
**I am helping the anti-Segwit side, here, at my own expense.** Just as the developers of [bitcoinhardforkresearch]( have done. What has the anti-Segwit side done, but destroy good will in the community?

It helps to be skeptical and keep an open mind about complex topics. But if a person lies over and over again, their credibility diminishes.

They were making up all sorts of crap about the "dangers" of multi-sig (Alphabay is a centralized escrow market.) As they say, the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

We're all very pleased about the miners' recent BIP91 initiative.
Immediately after Segwit goes live I will start funding hard fork development- with a focus on helping with the 2x portion of Segwit2x. Since I've never contributed such a big sum to dev before, in the next week or so I will start a public discussion asking for advice on how exactly to do this.
But, let's get Segwit activated first. Cheers.

Emergent Consensus is just [too disruptive]( not to mention centralizing.
Unlimited blocks also require [indefinite inflation]( Again, I am against any proposal which raises the 21 million coin limit as established in Satoshi's white paper.
There must be a block size limit, even if it is not 1MB.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:40:57
My community does not want Bitcoin to become Datacenter-coin. Datacenters are vulnerable to court orders and the use of force by governments. Bitcoin needs to offer something different from the existing financial system.
Having blocks on the order of 100MB is without a doubt centralizing. The idea is to avoid trusted third parties, not trust them! We are designing a system to last for centuries- this means getting it right from the beginning, and accounting for **all** theoretical scenarios. (Such as, what would happen if a single country had 100% control of bitcoin, and there was a war?)
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:21:25
This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoin. It's concerning that people aren’t concerned about the centralization of mining- and that **many BU proponents actually prefer this!** Centralization of mining was the original problem Satoshi spent the most time on in the white paper- the 51% attack is no joke.
Ver is also [okay with this]( And he's okay with bitcoin becoming [centralized like Paypal]( while claiming it's Satoshi's true vision!
There was never a ["true" vision of Satoshi]( Satoshi was an interesting character- he was right on most things but frequently contradicted himself. He couldn't predict the advent of mining pools and thought fraud proofs for SPV clients could be solved.
His actions are more important than his words- he never did any hard-forks, only soft-forks. He was [against multiple implementations]( which is something I slightly disagree with.

Changes in community sentiment always take time, as well as new features and code. Patience is required for change. Working, bug-free protocols in production are the strongest justifier for such protocols. Segwit has now been activated on five altcoins without incident, along with **massive** corresponding price rises for each!
I am proud to be on the side that emphasizes thorough testing of changes. BU supporters claimed Segwit was not tested despite years in testnet, then they claimed testing in a production network was necessary (now even this has happened- a **UASF on a production network!**) They continually shift the goalposts, meanwhile BU's Emergent Consensus^TM has **never even been tried** on any alt-coin ever, much less a $25 billion ecosystem! It's a double standard that shows the true motivations of most BU supporters.
Because they (mostly) aren't interested in bitcoin's growth. This is not their objective. Their eyes are on Emergent Consensus^TM as their prize, which is not only disruptive: it gives large miners a significant advantage over small miners.
And the day we hard fork past 21 million coins, is the day I sell every last one of mine.
