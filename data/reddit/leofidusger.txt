If the actual transaction is relayed to the POS terminal, it can verify that the transaction is valid and then relay the transaction to make sure it's mined, making fake spends impractical

But you are trusting the node to honestly report the miners when asked for them with that command. It could just report a bunch of addresses which all belong to the pool operator.

In English, the word is primarily used to refer to the USA, but that's not the only way it's used outside of the USA. It took me a whole of three minutes to find a counter example: "China has shared its prosperity with the other countries in the region and the world at large, from Asia to Europe, from America to Africa," [on a chinese news site]( Another [Chinese website calling the continent simply America]( 
Even [wikipedia]( says that the word America is ambigious and can refer to the landmass of North, Central and South America.

I think the idea was to mock the myriad of altcoins, not bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-06-04 07:26:15
Yes, with the power of the entire bitcoin network and a few months time, you could have two different private keys for the same address. Of course, with overwhelming probability you would be the only one using that address. Also, this would require that you can store the private keys without severely impacting the hashrate, which may be a challenge, and this assumes that you can do RIPEMD160 of SHA256 of the data at about the same speed as SHA256 of SHA256 of the data.
It's far from being a viable attack, but it's a nice piece of trivia.

My point isn't German law, my point is that many countries have applicable laws. If you steal Bitcoins it's reasonable to assume that you can go to prison for theft; without being a Japanese lawer I wouldn't simply assume that Japan has no law to can punish inside trading that happens to involve Bitcoins (and fiat currency).

Anybody who is reasonably confident in reading C++ code can read and understand it. If you are well versed in another programming language chances are that you can read it too. Translating thousands of lines of code into natural language would be mostly pointless:
1. the code would change faster than the translation.
2. you would get hundreeds or likely thousands of pages, barely anybody would really read that
3. most kinds of errors in the code wouldn't be obvious in natural language, or they wouldn't be visible in a translation at all
4. it would be incredibly hard to write it at all on a level that is understandable to non-technical people. Most likely you would end up with something that only a programmer can understand, which would make it pointless again.
And of course nobody wants to write all that stuff.

A POS system could monitor for ~10 seconds which transactions are being relayed close to big mining pools. You could build entire (really inexpensive) services around determining the probability of a dubble spend within few seconds. That would reduce the risk considerably.


Dogecoin's one minute block time could certainly help.
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:25:08
They apparently Eligius has mining contracts for mining nonstandart transactions. Not sure how well that pays and who gets the money.
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:44:27
There could be more work done on making it more secure to accept payments without waiting for confirmations. There are some ways you can make them reasonably secure (mainly watching how the transaction propagates through the network). That would enable near-instant payment (lets say 5-10 seconds or so) with some risk.
In theory you could reduce the block time. Dogecoin is working relativly well with one minute blocks. Whether that's good enough is debatable and there are good reasons not to go much lower (blocks need time to get known in the whole network. That time should be considerably higher than the time between creating two blocks).
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:05:18
Variable transaction fees are in development to Bitcoin Core and will solve this. That would lead to clients increasing their transaction fees in such an attack. hat's inconvenient, but leaves the network somewhat functioning and makes the attack even less sustainable than it is now.

The current code just picks one node at random and requests all blocks from him (in batches of 500 blocks).  So the person downloading is stuck with whatever upload speed some random node has. That's why it can take days to download a few gigabytes of blockchain.
Version 0.10 will hopefully be more sane, downloading from multiple nodes in parallel.

Well, you can trace the seperate coins on the blockchain. One could imagine a wallet that just applies the current exchange price to every transaction you do and save the exact capital gains in a spreadsheet. You could even imagine a wallet setting to spend your coins in LIFO order.

Contrary to popular opinion, Silk Road was an online marketplace catering primarily to those making purchases for resale -- that is, to street drug dealers buying stock to sell offline, and to illegal drug manufacturers purchasing the products and services allowing them to synthesise illegal drugs -- therefore being not an ebay for drugs, but a Paradigm Shifting Criminal Innovation.

Well, hopefully they are all saved in your wallets. Of course there are limitations: you can't tell whether you bought a $2 sandwich or something else that's worth only $1.8, but neither can anybody else.

You can modify the settings to connect to fewer nodes. With the right settings you can modify the upload/download ratio up to bringing upload down to the same level as download. That's much healthier for the network at this time than to throttle the upload.

I'm not questioning that, those are strawman arguments.

Digital sounds nicer, but in the end it is a meaningless description. Currency amounts are always digital (as in: composed of digits), and even the meaning "related to computers" is only circumstantial: there is nothing in the bitcoin system that requires the use of computers, that's simply the most practical form of using it known today.
When pitching it to someone on the street we can go with "digital currency", but that's marketing-speak that doesn't belong in a bloomberg description.

If every transaction occured on the blockchain, a simple piece of software can do that without problems (if you assume every transaction occured at the current exchange price).
