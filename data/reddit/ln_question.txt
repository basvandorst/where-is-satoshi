Coinbase should do everyone a favor and move on from BTC
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:31:28
Go read the lightning network white paper, which is where the 133 MB came from. 133 MB is to support the LN.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:49:06
For Bitcoin's benefit and for the community's. I would not benefit either way, and I don't think Coinbase would either.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:54:43
Bcash fans are not opposed to 2nd layer solutions. However, LN is not widely rolled out yet, and even with LN, block size needs to increase to at least 133MB to support global demand. Both solutions are needed.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:49:38
Thank you! How can we make this happen?
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:01:35
Coinbase should just get out of BTC altogether
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:39:31
What I meant was, has anyone tried to implement any of these suggestions and measure decentralization?
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:38:33
Wow, that really sucks for their customers. I imaging this will hurt a lot of people. What BS. The exchange was hacked on May 7 but didn't tell anyone until July 1, at which time customers were given *4 whole hours* to respond before liquidating their crypto for $5,939 per BTC! That's essentially a $4,000 haircut per BTC!!!
Hacks happen, but this is a terrible way to handle it, or at least communicate it.
* What is the exchange doing to track/recover the funds?
* How much of a loss is the exchange and its owners taking?
* What is the shared liability they are proposing (it would seem the loss is 100% on customers)?
* How are they going to compensate customers for their loss?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:21:56
LOL, I hope you're joking! If not, did you even look at the pages of the white paper I linked to?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:04:32
Lightning network does require bigger blocks to scale globally. However, larger blocks up to 4MB (and probably beyond) are not an issue today, and will only get easier as hardware improves.
However, by asking any valid question about scaling on this forum, you are going to get nothing but downvotes. Good luck getting thoughtful answers.
See this post for a prime example of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:12:25
This study shows the effects of increasing block size
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:57:05
Have you seen this? They recommend 4MB years ago. Could probably make it higher now. 
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:31:40
The author separates the ideas of "how useful" a monetary good is from how widely adopted it is. To me, it seems that these factors are deeply related - widespread adoption is one of the big factors that makes a monetary good useful. The more people take a monetary good, the more it can be used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:21:38
Are you suggesting there are no studies about increasing blocksize? There are, and they show almost no effect on the network for a 1-3MB increase
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:54:04
Ethereum is running better than Bitcoin with higher data rate, more nodes, and lower fees. Raising blocksize by a small amount will cause no issues. You are simply wrong, and history will show it.
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:32:55
It is not "We" vs "They". I support both chains and think BTC is Bitcoin because of accumulated difficulty. In the end, it is driven by Hashpower, which follows price, which follows use, which follows technology and community. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 00:47:14
Not sure I follow... I think you're saying scaling isn't really important right now? Don't you think high fees will (once again) hamper adoption?
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:41:54
I didn't say it won't be ready, I implied it isn't ready yet. Primetime would be when Lightning can support at least a sizable fraction if not majority of transactions and volume. Currently the total liquidity of the Lightning network is about $4MM, which is less than 1% of the 24h transaction volume (not directly apples to apples, but the best comparison I can find). I would say that is not quite ready yet. When transaction volume is closer to 50% of total, Lightning will be in full swing and definitely "Primetime"
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:47:39
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:46:32
Thanks for the well-reasoned response. Keeping user fees low seems intuitively more important to me to promote adoption, but that is just my view as a user since I'm not a developer and don't have that expertise.
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:41:13
Could one make a measure of transaction statistics by continuously monitoring channel states over time and looking for differences in balances? My understanding is that channel states must be public in order to find a routing path (correct me if I'm wrong). It seems that monitoring states may enable some estimation of transactions, though it would not be perfect
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:56:43
I get what you're saying, but couldn't lower adoption and problematic  fees (i.e. fees that discourage use) occur simultaneously? I think that was the case in late 2017 and early 2018.
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:57:28
What do you think about high fees? Do you agree that they discourage use? And if so, is this a problem?
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:55:35
When is "soon"?
Shouldn't the focus remain on scaling until a workable solution is in place?
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:44:02
Do you keep money in a checking or savings account? That is similar to a Lightning Channel. You would have open a small number of channels at any one time. One could offer high interest rate, another could offer low fees. Visa, banks, etc do charge user fees, which would still exist, though some fees would go to on-chain settlement. You could do buying, selling, receive paycheck, pay mortgage, etc through these channels. This is actually pretty similar to how money is spent today, though no one can really say how different it would be in practice. Certainly the technology would be different.

@_date: 2017-08-26 18:05:58
I know it's convenient to label dissenters as "attackers", but there are also people who are honest and concerned members of the community. These are not "shills", though they are probably pretty pissed off (as am I) about the state of the scaling debate, and how it's fractured the community. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:28:04
How? If you're going to say centralization, there's no way with current technology that would cause any. Capacities have almost doubled since we first starting hitting the 1Mb limit 2 years ago. No issues then with 1Mb... no issues now with 2Mb
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:17:03
To get confirmed in 39+ blocks (~6.5 hours), the fee is estimated at $0.60. Way too long to get confirmed if you want to execute a trade or buy something online. Source:  
It's not concern trolling if it's genuine concern from someone who cares about BTC and has for years.
The AVERAGE fee is $6.50, yet you cherry pick $0.30 for a small minority of transactions and say it's acceptable???
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:13:54
I think most people are honest and wouldn't do a replace-by-fee (AKA double spend) if they are trying to use bitcoin and support the network.
There are always some bad actors out there. What's your credit card chargeback rate?
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:27:08
Can't come soon enough!
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:33:07
I'd recommend both - paper for long term, and nano for short term.
The issue I've had with Trezor (not Nano, so this may not apply), is they keep doing firmware updates. I've had to recover my keys from my seed a few times, which is a nerve-wracking process!!
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:24:16
I agree that works for slower transactions, I think the issue is more for when faster transactions are needed or wanted.
@_date: 2019-06-30 11:41:47
Good clarification between pools vs hashers, thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:34:11
I'll buy the coin from you - but only after you redeem it! I would want it for the collectable value of the coin itself
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:23:06
Don't miners run full nodes (and are required to do so)?
A different question: How does decreasing the number of non-mining nodes reduce decentralization?
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:17:29
Because it's not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:34:25
How is improving scaling a scam? Moron
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:51:42
Truly not FUD... FUD implies bad intent, whereas my intentions truly do come from a good place with BTC's best interest at heart. No one seems to agree with me on these points :/
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:35:21
You nailed it. Ironic that OP completely misses the biggest ACTUAL threat to BTC - the high fees with no end in sight. I don't know why Segwit isn't being used more though. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:01:29
Even decentralized movements need leadership from someone or some group. Otherwise there is no direction. Ver is among the many leaders of Bitcoin Cash (not so much Bitcoin any more)
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:02:06
Something fundamental shifted yesterday. Bitcoin will not scale in the short term. You cannot argue this is a good thing. Long term could still be OK, but the price will reflect the risk that it won't.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:52:28
I'm a holder. Not buying now, not selling. However, the lack of any good near-term scaling solution scares me.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:10:58
u/cryptochecker info BTC eth BCH
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:03:48
Looks to be a 26/100 (and growing) compared to the 2017 peak. Nice!
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:48:17
Why would you? BCH already has a scaling solution in place. BTC has none in sight...
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:03:31
Technically, maybe. Branding? No, Bitcoin still has that, and Bitcoin Cash inherits that to some extent.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:44
Smaller blocks means we can keep fees higher, which will prevent mainstream adoption until the technology is ready, or an altcoin emerges that surpasses Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:23:44
Good in theory, but have you tried using the Lightning network? I tried setting up a node... failed and gave up. It's not ready yet.
@_date: 2019-04-01 23:55:29
I agree that we need a shorter-term solution to rising fees, which I think will severely limit adoption. Unfortunately that adoption is going to spill over to other coins rather the the OG crypto. I worry BTC will go the way of MySpace. It seems that multiple competing solutions are needed.
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:18:39
Increasing the block size is necessary and inevitable for later 2 solutions to work (as stated in the Lightning white paper). However, we need a scaling solution sooner than Lightning since blocks are getting full, and Lightning is way too difficult to use for most technical people, much less the general population.
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:38:07
Good to know I'm not the only one who thinks this, though based on the downvotes you'd have no idea! Contributing substantive discussion doesn't seem to matter if you contradict the chosen narrative. The voted patterns seek to exclude these ideas.
Keep on using your brain, and thanks for voicing an alternative viewpoint. Diversity of thought is more valuable than ever.
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:33:15
How are they good? I only see the downside of high fees
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:37:14
Within you condescending reply, you don't actually answer the question either... but I'll bite anyway.
I fell in love with BTC years ago because it has the potential to free us from the shackles of the current financial system, and gives people true ownership of their money. Bitcoin is free speech incarnate. However, in the absence of hyperinflation, free speech and low inflation is not what will make Bitcoin appeal to most people. Your condescension is way off target.
Bitcoin WON'T free us from anything if it isn't widely adopted. The value will fluctuate too much, and it won't be reliable money. High fees are a huge barrier to adoption, ergo my concern. If you don't get this, then you understand very little about why Bitcoin may one day appeal to the common man.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:46:47
If it costs $50 to open a Lightning channel, what's the incentive for the common man to use Bitcoin over traditional payments? Driving up the price by constraining the supply will lower the demand.
Bitcoin will be less successful the less it is used.
@_date: 2019-04-23 23:10:13
This one is nice - easy to read. I wish they estimated fees to get in the next block though, it seems the nearest timeframe is 30 minutes.
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:04:54
Good description of the problem. It seems complex. Thinking about adoption, this seems to be a significant barrier.
So what's the user-friendly (i.e. simple) solution? Connecting with high-liquidity routing nodes?
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:05:44
Your view is too narrow, and your priorities are miscalibrated. If you sacrifice usability for decentralization, BTC's growth will stagnate, and it will never become relevant to the general population. Decentralization will not matter.
Technical people lose sight of the user experience too often.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:39:35
But like a computational person, right? Not a human person?
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:36:57
Which is the corporate takeover of Bitcoin: the 2x companies and miners taking over the 2MB chain, or Blockstream taking over the 1MB chain? Both seem true. However, the 2x chain would have more entities supporting it, so you could also argue it would hypothetically be less centralized.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:22:45
It's comparing layer 2 to layer 1... so, not really
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:39:11
Probably cheaper to send via truck than transact on-chain... :P
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:02:53
Great point!
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:09:35
Kudos to the devs!!
Has anyone been discussing a timeline for implementing this, or is it too new for that to have happened?
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:44:31
The Nov 2013 $1140 bubble was more like the 3rd bubble, but it really depends on the definition. You could plausibly say Nov 2013 was the 6th bubble. The April 2013 bubble peaked around $266, so Nov 2013 was a 4.3x increase over that.
