This is a good investment strategy for ANYTHING that you're confident has a huge future.
E.g. 
I bought the dip in Samsung after the Note 7 exploded and held until the design leaks of the S8 caused a huge bump. (because wow what a beautiful phone)
I'm long in TSLA and I'll buy more every time there's a drop, because that company is an energy company that is currently valued at the price of a car company just because they currently happen to only make cars. (I see TSLA with a realistic long term top end of around $900/share if you take the logic of the value of an average energy production and supply company + the value of an average large automaker + a little bit extra because they have the perception of being a luxury brand so can operate with larger profit margins than a lot of competitors)
And by the same logic, I buy more BTC every time it dips, because a decentralised currency is an inevitable future.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:02:28

@_date: 2018-03-03 07:21:06
Yes. That's why this will be an interesting case, because despite crypto being different to stocks, it seems (at least to me) that it should be subject to a lot of the same laws to prevent foul play.
However at the time coinbase did "the Bcash thing" there was no law against it, so no real crime was committed, UNLESS bitcoin is ruled to be close enough to a stock that they should have known better.
Basically either way it sets a really interesting precident for lawmaking surrounding crypto. It's the sort of thing that does need to appear before several courts sooner or later.

True. But the fact that bitcoin is being treated just like any other form of money would be in a case like this is actually really important long term.

Yeah not sure why anyone would get a 2 seat car with no trunk when you can buy a faster 7 seat SUV with 2 trunks.

Did Felicity mine all the bitcoins in the world by typing really well?

I still don't actually understand why MySpace got replaced by Facebook. It's possible I'm not quite old enough to remember what MySpace actually did, but in my head they're exactly the same thing and for some reason the earlier one that everyone was already using failed?

No, that's in Egypt.

Except the Leaf isn't crappy? It's a very technologically advanced car that has zero running costs and is super comfy.
The new one even has self driving to rival Tesla.

To answer what you're actually asking, yes you can post it at the top of your blog and ask for donations.

Not according to my Dota teammates

Which two wrestlers are in the main event of Deathcross this year?

Bitcoin and Dota are basically the same thing then? In that Russians fucking ruin it.

How does that one idiot think he's found a brick wall? Can he not tell the difference between bricks and the skin of an animal?

You are aware that electric propulsion is faster, right?

I mean that's.. uh...
...That's what the 'digital' bit means.
That's like saying "I hate the term email because you can just press send, it's not like you have to hook your laptop up to a post box!"

Yeah. You ever seen a grown man naked?

Give it another 10 years and it will be a different robot that prepares and hands over the food, no humans required at all.

That seems incredibly dishonest. If it says you're buying from "ledger official" and Amazon sell you a fake they should be taken to court.
But hey, that's only one of millions of reasons that Jeff Bezos should be in jail.

I'll be getting it in Tesla colour, thanks.

I dunno, in the 30s people actually thought the president had power and was something to care about.

Indian government can't even provide their citizens with enough toilets and they think they know how to regulate finance markets?

Name a single job that can't be done better by a robot.
And now think about what 100% unemployment means for the way our society is currently structured.

I love shit like this. It's like a real life version of the egg hunt from ready player one.

Why is everyone talking about different brands of SlowTeslas?

No such thing. RuneScape is an eternal constant.
