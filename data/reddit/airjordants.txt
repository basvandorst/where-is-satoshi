It looks like you missed my post from earlier. I would fund my account myself to try this out but I don't see that option anywhere on the site. =/

I had the exact same phone call just a few days ago as well from Chase. Seems they are keeping an eye on bitcoin users.

I've been a player on this site since it's first few days and it's been really fun! There are some very active users though, some of which are very good so there is definitely skill involved.

A bitcoin millionaire that splurged on his new found riches?

GDAX refuses to raise withdrawal limits right now though. $10k per day is not very great.

I've tried just just about everything: force-quitting, restarting the app, restarting my phone and even uninstalling and reinstalling. It's still not allowing me to verify for some reason. 
I'll send a PM with those details.

BTC withdrawals are disabled for the weekend. They should hopefully be working again sometime next week.

Has verifying hotspots been disabled? When I try to verify now it gives the message:
"User ID is not the identifier of the current user [SE]"

I can hardly imagine what that would do to your mental health.

Haha damn, cool your jets.

Yes, I think I'll just throw my money at you in hopes that this isn't a complete scam and you won't just take my money and disappear.

Black Friiiiiiiiiidaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy. Then a dip after that most likely.

What does this mean exactly? That Wall Street will now be watching over the price fluctuations of bitcoin?

I'm a bit regretful that I immediately signed up after I received my beta code. They ask for your full SSN and I gave it to them without thinking twice which is making me feel uneasy now. It is still a site in beta so anything could go wrong.

The US government could buy up a huge amount of bitcoins right now. That would drive the price up by a sizable margin, then once the price reached a point where they would be taking  in a large enough profit they could sell all of their holdings, which would tank the price once again. That will never happen though.
