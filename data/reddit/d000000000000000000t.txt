Segwit2X has a blocksize larger than 2mb. It is equivalent to 8mb blocks when full.

Personally, I'm not opposed to a 2mb hardfork *eventually* - if it turns out it's still needed to reduce network congestion after many months of segwit activation.
I don't think 6 months is enough time, and I think the premise of the NYA has been blown out of the water by the BCH fork extravaganza.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:22:28
Why do you think Segwit2X still has support on BTC?
Wouldn't those supporters have found what they wanted in BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:31:35
Well, how many people predicted a BCH fork? That seems to be the impetus for not wanting a rushed blocksize increase in the present.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:29:21


At the very most (until LNs are fleshed out). You have to wait for everyone to be using SegWit addresses before congestion will be alleviated. Granted, there's a lot of economic incentive for companies who depend on high BTC throughput for income to adopt it, but users need to follow through as well.

There's a proof of concept python script on the site but you I believe you would need to execute a MITM attack by hijacking a domain server or something for this to work, which isn't a trivial affair though easily achieved by someone with nation states resources for example. Maybe kind of out of the realm of script-kiddie.

1mb block, 1 block every 10 minutes, average transaction size of 250b.
@_date: 2017-04-28 00:26:58
Agreed, and that's a good point to make.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:56:48


It's part of the protocol. [The difficulty of finding the correct hash (mining)]( is algorithmically set so that on average a miner will mine a block every 10 minutes.

Because every transaction has to go into a fixed-size block and there are only so many blocks per day. If you can handle/are interested in the technical 
details, the [original Satoshi whitepaper]( is faily readable. Otherwise, google around for "how does the blockchain work"; there are a bunch of decent explanations around the internet.
The details of the Bitcoin protocol (block size, block time, transaction size) could be changed, but changing them in a way so that all system using Bitcoin agree is very difficult for political and practical reasons. There are currently 3 or so main proposals for dealing with the scaling issue: Extension Blocks, SegWit, and Bitcoin Unlimited. The details of each are fairly different and the topic is very contentious.

Bitfinex is having banking problems right now. You currently cannot withdrawal fiat there.

There are at least 5 posts on their front page about how it is a conspiracy or a distraction. In which there are users going on rants about AXA, Bilderburg, the freemasons, the Bill Gates Foundation,  and repeated suggestions that the feature is not on by default (even though there seems to be easily verifiable evidence it is), suggestions that it is a remote management feature similar to one some core dev did in something years ago, suggestions that all the activity on both subs is manufactured, and more.
I like the idea behind the sub but there are some real kooks hiding out there.

I don't entirely disagree with you, but very skilled C programmers make memory bugs ALL THE TIME. Even projects like OpenBSD which have ridiculously high security standards have buffer overflow exploits from time to time. 
Considering where C is used, across hundreds of millions of devices and systems, it is very concerning that even the best programmers are designing exploitable software.

Mining solely for the coinbase transaction. What incentive is there for that if the possible outcome is 12.5 btc vs ~54 btc in fees?
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:35:39
Welp, you can't get much more direct than that. Thanks.

Many have different use cases. Is Pepsi directly competing with Welch's or Jack Daniels? Smart contracts and value storage are different markets.
And just the fact that bitcoin was there first gives it a huge advantage. The first mover advantage is huge in cryptocurrencies, as it means a lot of cumulative effort in securing the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 06:28:46
Did it? I'm just going off what I recall seeing in the weekly posts about full blocks...Which I guess was probably referring to the whole mempool rather than new blocks. Do you have a source for that data? I'd be interested in looking through it.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:28:24
What's the source of the multiple implementations quote?

[This is not what Satoshi thought]( as I recently learned.
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:09:13
A bigger pool of devs/contributors, maybe?
Not much, I think.

Bitcoin was never instant. Nor will any first layer blockchain solution ever be instant. That's not how the blockchain works.
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:12:23
Not everyone is a bitcoin maximalist...
I don't see why cryptocurrencies can't coexist.
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:11:16
That's bullshit. What realistic incentive is there for a miner to mine empty blocks other than asicboost?
