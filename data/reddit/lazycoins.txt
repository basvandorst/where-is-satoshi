Hi Please see our comment above or read this thread for more information: 
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:09:54
Unfortunately no, simply because of our obligation to follow kyc/aml rules.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:06:45
Thank you for the search :). Current site is just a beta, all details will be available on the new site from tomorrow.

Hi Guys,
This thread was just brought to my attention by u/Irishbit. By reading the comments I see there is some criticism and clear confusion about our past and future ambitions. We launched our beta last year with 0% fees and have been in development since then. We took our time to get things right with our software, security, corporate structure and banking. We are now officially launching later this evening. I would kindly request you to send your feedback or comments to the original thread so we can reply to them promptly.
Original thread: 
To anyone who wonders why we are called Lazy..
P.s. Would be great to hear your feedback at least a week after our launch.

It will be better and a lot easier for the Brits and the Europeans :) Will be glad to hear your feedback after launch. Please tweet us your thoughts once you have tested our platform after it goes live. 
LazyPay is designed with the brick and mortar merchants in mind. A year from now we expect high percentage of local shops around UK will start accepting Bitcoins. They have small margins of profit, so paying transaction fees is a real pain. For a non tech-savvy merchant, service like LazyPay can help them reduce their fees to 0.

There were over 100 shill accounts created by a user in Italy who was spamming our page. It was one of the task from the giveaway which we had to cancel when the abuse was discovered 
Comments from the accounts using the same IP were deleted.
Company name coming up on the footer. :)
The UK government seems to be heading towards the right direction. Fingers crossed this will trickle down to our banks.

Here's $1 on me @_date: 2015-03-02 11:39:26
It will be in the evening. No counter :)

Our UK and European banking partners support our structure. We have been licensed to operate as a money exchange. Users can trade fiat/fiat as well as digital currency pairs.
SPI License is also applied for, which comes under the FCA regulations. This is required before we launch LazyPay 
Therefore it will be fair to say that so far we have been taken seriously, by the "system" and the community. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:33:33
Its early days but yes there are some open orders
Please create a ticket with your username, so we can update you on the status.
@_date: 2015-03-30 12:25:17
Starting to write a blog dedicated to this, will help get the information out.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:02:51
I think maybe you have misunderstood my answer, we cannot accept anonymous cash payments to our account, if you have completed KYC/AML requirements and if your account is fully verified, you are more than welcome to make an over the counter (bank) deposit in to our client account. However there are terms and limits re over the counter and other methods of deposits. Details will be available on our website.        
 
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:14:43
All the alts were listed whilst in beta to test our platform. If you notice from our twitter announcements we are removing most of them and keeping the exchange exclusive to Bitcoin,Fiat and few others. 
New site will be live today and you will be able to test BTC/GBP with FPS.
Edit: "What UK needs is a fiat BTC exchange with FPS." Definitely agree!
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:44:54
Thank you..If you have any further questions and need a faster response, you can get in touch with us anytime via support.
Hope you like our site. :)
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:44:03
You will be welcomed to visit our office with your documents to verify your account, but unfortunately we can not accept cash as this creates a security issue for us and among other complications.
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:50:07
New site will be live this evening. Follow us on twitter for announcements later today. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:41:07
Not a bank nor we have any such intentions for the future, rather your go to Bitcoin portal. :)
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:46:55
Banking was one of our main concerns, which also held us back from launching earlier. We took our time to find the right banking partner who understands our structure, we have done that now and its all positive. Can't predict the future as that's something not in our control but we do hope for the best like everyone else.

@_date: 2015-03-01 23:04:57
Typo fixed, thanks :)
The limit will be below £5000. We are making our service more convenient for our users and Bitcoiners, but it must be done while complying with the rules. Have a go through our detailed terms tomorrow and give us your feedback then. You can contact support if the enquiry is urgent.
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:38:54
Thank you..Since LazyPay will also have fiat wallets, we believe it is required 
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:39:02
Details can be confirmed on the HMRC's website. Thank you
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:43:46
To get SPI one must have MSB approved. This is only for LazyPay.co.uk which is a merchants platform.
No SPI required for exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:42:27
We did get in touch when the Government called for more information earlier this year. Thanks for the advice, we will definitely approach them again after the launch. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:55:17
Same could be said about the QA team :D Here's $5 on me @_date: 2015-02-13 12:54:02
"Except its not fully registered" You are welcome to do your research. Our license is under Money Exchange Business. 
SPI applied for LazyPay.co.uk, which is only required for a small payments company not a currency exchange.
Edit: SPI is required for any business that handles fiat for merchant payments. LazyPay will also have fiat wallets.

You might want to read the whole article it actually answer that with figures in the end. 
Thank you

We are a licensed bureau de change with fait and digital currency markets, so we have the support of our banking partners. Hopefully this will be a long-lasting one.

Hi Guys, Obtaining an MSB License is a step forward towards getting our SPI license for LazyPay. This was asked of us by the HMRC. We believe that we must comply with their requirements before we launch our fiat services for both the exchange and our merchant platform.
Although not very difficult to get, it is very important for companies in UK to have if handling fiat currencies. Relevant checks are made by HMRC to make sure people running the business pass "Fit and Proper Test". 
These are small steps, which make a big difference.
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:51:00
Any business that handles fiat currency or a fiat exchange service is required to have MSB license by law in UK regardless the fact of how much it costs or the application procedure. This is something we have done in order to abide with the local law.
