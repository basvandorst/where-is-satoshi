That would have to be some of the stupidest security planning ever. A bank is the last place you'd store a bitcoin key.
Want to store something securely? Encrypt it, stash it in a cave.

The real question is a losing battle on which side.
Without via technical means of enforcement, regulations are meaningless and compliance is voluntary.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:47:33


Actually I completely disagree.
Safety deposit boxes are a centralized point of failure and a very tempting target, in addition to being located in a physical building that can comply with governments.
If you want to store something securely, bury it secretly somewhere no one will look, or put it in a hard to access part of a cave.

Democratizing snooping inherently makes it very difficult for agencies like the NSA to do en-mass. When you've no longer got tap points like [Room 641A]( as an option for mass-data collection, SIGINT returns to being a highly targeted proposition reserved for important targets - as it should be.
You might be misunderstanding what I meant by distribute, I don't mean everyone gets a copy of everything - more of a mesh-type infrastructure where there are no more network backbones.

You trust *any* large CDN, or any large service not on the deep web (or even possibly on the deep web) for that matter, to not be in bed with the federal government at this point?
Our only chance at reclaiming the internet is to massively distribute *everything* until there's no central point you can readily tap to obtain data for "national security".

Funny how that thread's OP said the $1,000 bitcoin happened in 2015. I think we'll hit it in a couple weeks if the market doesn't finally correct itself.
But if growth doesn't slow a bit when the good news stops, we're in for it to crash like all hell.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:11:35
Yeah, looks like my 770 sell off was the right move. Wish I'd been able to get more volume in, but I didn't feel like selling all the way down to the 600s at the time. I'll be re-entering with those coins once market depth is more equal.

Been there, done that, minus the kids as I don't have any yet. Life not doing anything gets sort of boring, actually.

Maybe, but also fuckers like me who have price alarms. I don't trust stop and limit orders to maximize profits when things go all screwy, like they just did.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:30:54
Oh absolutely. I think a lot of traders have no idea what they are doing, and go off nothing more than current price.
Forget the absolute price, the real clues are in price, trade volume and market depth trends. Granted I falsely spotted this current crash starting at 330 and bailed for a few hours with some coins, ultimately missing around 5% in gains from that, but I also correctly spotted the real crash starting last night!

Important to remember that the spent and cashed out bitcoins still end up back in circulation, usually.
In fact, I'd say the use of bitcoin for commodities is the big reason traditional investors are getting more bullish.
Best of luck with your company!

Really the only way around this is to base the win/loss decision on something that is public, and has a huge amount of entropy that isn't subject to side-channel attacks.
Pulling the least significant figures of transaction total from the next block might be workable, amrite?
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:33:43
I haven't tried analyzing any of these "provable fair" gambling systems for possible sidechannel attacks, but I wouldn't be too surprised that some do exist here and there.
I'd imagine no one would share if they had actually found one, but has anyone bothered to analyze one at more than a cursory level and figured out there was really no way of fudging the odds in either direction through side channels?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:09:38
I was napping when it happened and woke up to a price alarm going WTF 590!? Proceeded to scramble and get a good bit out at ~$770 on VirWox before it reacted. Market depth has been really screwy since, but the price is more stable (with low trade volume though, bad sign for longer term stability)
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:15:18
It's way better to gamble on the markets against other people. While the house (in this case the market) still always wins, you can be a bloodthirsty bastard and make the money that other people are losing.
I'm not wrong, I'm just an asshole :-D
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:36:43
Timed both of the previous two bubbles fairly well, selling off a bit before the peak.
Sold off some at 330 on this one, and more at 770. But now I have the fortunate problem of not being able to effectively get in and out of the market, so I'm stuck riding this one out a lot, even though I know we're looking a third (likely softer) bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:53:43
Probably a little while. Market depth is still very small on the buy side in comparison to sell, so I predict further short term losses.
In the long term, I definitely still predict gains. Get out and re-enter later if you are a daytrader (as I did a few hours ago to the greatest degree I could), get in/hold if you are a long term investor.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:59:45
Just look at the real stock market!
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:47:46
Excluding the bitcoins I'm just hoarding due to lack of being able to day trade effectively in bitcoin with large sums yet, I've been doing fairly well day trading.
I'm up 10% after fees today alone for example from simply timing market movement to enter/exit. Unfortunately all the coins I can't easily day trade are probably in for losing a bit more in the short term.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:30:13
I got into bitcoin back when they were worth a couple dollars in early 2011. I cashed out a lot when they hit $20, before subsequently crashing. I bought back in with more in late 2011, and held until they hit ~$170 in April, again cashing out. I bought back in over the summer in the 70s.
I just cashed out a lot again at $330, as I'm expecting we're in our third bubble, but I'm getting right back in when things stabilize again. I honestly feel like seeing these mini-bubbles coming is not rocket science. Price just went up too damn fast.
I still do have sizable bitcoin holdings, and expect we'll see the $1000 bitcoin within a year.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:42:57
Oh definitely. Bitcoin will be going up in the long haul. I'm just trying to protect my gains until the market stabilizes. I managed to capture most of the upswing, and I'm keen to wait until market depth equalizes on the buy/sell sides before I start investing more again. I think it is safe to say we'll see at least a bit more of a drop in the short term.

Shoot, I've broken both your rules so many times... yet I'm beating the market as a day trader.
Fuck me, right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:42:30
I called a crash when it surpassed 300, sold a batch off at 330 and was wrong. I reacted to the crash from 900, selling off at 770... and we're still in that neighborhood.
I'd called the two previous bubbles fairly well, always managing to cash out large holdings while things were still on the upside.
At this point I have no idea what the hell is going to happen, there are so many conflicting indicators pointing to it stabilizing, crashing and increasing. My money is still on crash in over the next week, but I'm nowhere near certain.
I'm still holding the majority of my BTC for the long term.

No, I'm selling for Linden Dollars on virwox, not USD. Their value tracks USD pretty closely though.
I'm already fucked enough as it is on capital gains taxes from fiat investments this year (I mean, the fact that they've done so well is good and all!)
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:26:52
It isn't a liability thing, it is federal law (IIRC under the NFA). If said law were not on the books, there'd be no more legal liability to the sender/recipient than if a mailed a brick somehow hit someone on the head. You can only send firearms *to* a licensed firearms dealer through the mail.
So basically have them mailed to licensed FLL, then go pick up.
Of course you know how effective enforcement is, given how long it took to bust black market reloaded's major firearm dealer.

I almost burst out laughing at this.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:18:12
I like virwox because of the price breaks, and instant withdrawl/depoist plus other oddball curenncies. You only need to trade ~19k/USD month to get an 80% discount, aka 0.78%. It's let my play way narrower spreads. The only problem is they have pretty low volume.
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:18:02
Hah. Sometimes I wish I was wrong, but history says I've got the "Midas touch" when it comes to predicting bitcoin crashes. Honestly it isn't that difficult. My rule of thumb is when the price goes up 50% in a week, it is time to cut your gains and look at getting out once the trade volume starts to taper off, because the next step is always a huge influx of sell orders trying to undercut the market.
I do think this third bubble may well have a much softer crash. We could easily see the price remain stable over $200 or even $250 if there isn't the same type of media-fueled panic there was in the other two bubbles. I don't think we'll still be in at over $300 in a week unless trade volume increases a lot without the price going up further.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:49:56
Yeah, from watching other people's transactions I can tell there are a lot of really inexperienced traders.
Honestly I never thought of myself as that great of a daytrader on the regular markets, but I'm seeing bitcoin trends in a volatile market out several hours with extremely high accuracy.
Granted I take a loss here and there, but I'm now up almost 30% on my pool of day trading coins over the last three days, while the market is still down that much. I wish I could day trade with more coins, but the trade volume for clean entry/exit with narrow margins simply isn't on the exchanges yet. I've been lucky to move 15BTC before the price starts really fluctuating, and sometimes as little as 0.5 :-/
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:36:40
Overall I am, I'm just doing my best to game the market market short term. Apparently I've started doing a decent job of it again, as the value is back down enough to more than make up for my trade fees. I plan to fully re-enter as soon as market depth is stable, hopefully making some extra bitcoins for myself off the downswing.
I might be an asshole, but at least I'm a clever/lucky one :-D
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:39:49
Totally agreed. Would just like to see some of the sell-offs happen in a bit more prudent fashion, although intentionally tanking the market is unfortunately a viable strategy.

Beta blockers: the drug of choice for bitcoin traders
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:05:10
I'll share one of mine: market depth.
You can gauge volatility and future movement fairly well in the short term looking at market depth. Right now more people still want to sell than buy, so the price should continue going down until the trend reverses.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:31:30
I predict continued prices falls for at least several hours. Will start buying again once market depth equalizes.

@_date: 2013-11-19 12:48:30
Hard to say. You'll get some warning though, look for the market depth being roughly the same on the buy and sell sides before it starts closing in on a price.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:57:51
I'm not a daytrader, *but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night*...
I managed to time the previous two bubbles almost perfectly. This time I jumped the gun a bit early by selling some at 330, but sold a much larger lot at $770. Am not regretting it yet.
