Maybe because people are ok with it being volatile in the short term while still at rate of high monetary inflation which will decrease over time?  
@_date: 2015-06-27 12:38:43
right, so you either need higher fees or more transactions, or a balance of an increase in both. If you try to 'force' the substantially higher fees on users that would be needed if 1MB blocks stay in place (which caps the number of transactions) you risk losing those users, as users don't like being forced into fees.

My 2 satoshis:
Bitcoin as an end-user currency for things like buying a coffee or groceries in person is not going as well as many hoped, and bricks and mortar merchant use won't be widespread any time soon if ever (particularly in 1st world countries).
Online merchant adoption is more likely to be more successful as it's actually easier to use bitcoin to pay online than a credit card, and safer if you trust the merchant. We've seen some former bitcoin accepting companies stop accepting it and many new ones start. I expect it'll be used most with merchants where privacy tends to be most important - gambling/sex related stuff/VPNs, or gray areas where merchants are being cut-off by legacy payment processors like like e-cigarettes. Open Bazaar alone if it can work will be massive.
On the other hand there is a lot of momentum on using Bitcoin as a back-end rail, as a platform for other applications some of which may use it transparently (e.g. Abra).
The price has not been going down for 5 months now indicating there are many hodlers - bitcoin is being used as a digital gold, as well as for speculation by traders.
There are some remittance companies but I've seen no hard numbers on how well this aspect is doing, it's still possible this becomes one of the primary uses though, and may even drive some merchant adoption in countries that are on the receiving end.
Infrastructure is constantly improving, we've loads of mature wallets and exchanges now. The copay app is awesome, the shared wallet works really well - finally a user friendly multi-sig wallet! The bit license regulation is no longer an unknown. VC investing is healthy. Many companies will fail but the ones that make it will hopefully be great. 
From a PR point of view, Bitcoin is in a bad place. Many people think Bitcoin was a fad that has already passed, others think it's only for criminals and many more want nothing to do with an-caps or anti-gov libertarian politics. Enthusiastic attempts to ram bitcoin down peoples throats or brigading on communities often just results in a knee-jerk reaction against it. This reddit is unbearable at times, but I think people over estimate both it's representation and importance to bitcoin as a whole. 
On the positive side of the PR, the memory of gox is fading, media now speaks about bitcoin without having to attempt to explain what it is from scratch any more. A trend of talking about bitcoin (the blockchain) without mentioning bitcoin seems to be allowing reputable and legacy finance businesses to at least investigate it without fearing embarrassment.
There is more good educational information than ever before, James D'Angelo's videos are some of the best in my opinion. The Stanford videos and Andreas' book for more technical details, and we have Popper's Digital Gold book as layman's introduction. The Inside Man episode was a really good documentary intro also.
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:33:38
Look at the USD monetary inflation graph from that time though.
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:20:36


Above quote is from your earlier comment. I was originally talking about this as a kind of worst case disaster situation rather than something anyone would 'constantly' be doing. In fact I think it would be likely to happen only once at most due to a scenario we have like the blocksize. It would set a precedent for what happens when you limit the user-base, or try to force significantly higher fees on people, when alternatives without these downsides exist

Anyone who has significant savings in fiat and is educated will have probably just moved their money to a bank in a different European country. For example you can open an online account with Keytrade bank in Belgium. Even if Greece leaves the euro there's not necessarily going to be a crash in the euro, the Greek troubles so far are already priced in and they're just one small country in the grand scheme of the euro. It may even be seen as stronger for having gotten rid of them in that case. Probably an example needs to be made of Greece so that other countries don't follow their path by voting in lunatics trying to hold the rest of europe to ransom.

Bitcoins long term survival depends on usage increasing. Increased usage leads to increased price and increases numbers of transactions (therefore more transaction fees for miners)
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:57:16
This concept seems to be extremely hard for people to grasp, and even when they do they seem to keep forgetting it whenever there's a debate about something in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:08:59
It's always capable, but it would be much less likely. There are some who believe Bitcoin nodes and miners can hold the users to ransom, that fees can be raised to significant amounts and transactions limited so that the casual user basically never can or will use it. They think Bitcoin is untouchable because it was first and is the biggest crypto. It would only take one failure of such an approach to prove this is not a viable approach.
Think of Greece and the EU for a different type of example but with a similar idea - Greece has a gun to their head saying give us endless loans we won't pay back or I'll pull the trigger. Do you think if the EU calls their bluff and they leave the euro and have wrecked the country that Spain or Portugal will be next up with a gun to their head in 6 months? Probably not, it will only take one country to fail attempting this to discourage others trying it in future.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:27:14


That's not necessarily the question though, would higher fees curb adoption is the question, especially considering that there will be alternative coins happy to provide cryptocurrency functionality for lower fees.

Effectively leading to a cap on the number of overall users. This is one of the few ways a competing cryptocurrency can overtake bitcoin in number of users, and once that happens why would even the existing users of bitcoin not move to the more popular crypto?

It's the opposite of this. Greece are looking for free money from other EU countries to avoid austerity in their own country, and by austerity I mean actually collecting taxes, or having a retirement age in line with other EU countries. If the EU cave and give them this money without reform, it incentivizes other countries dealing with austerity to follow the same path. 
If the grexit happens, it's going to be terrible for the average Greek person, the country is going back to being a 2nd world country. It's going to be a warning to other EU countries not to vote in extremist lunatics or the same will happen them.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:34:54
A better question is what percentage of bitcoin transactions that have been broadcast to the network are currently in a block and whether there is no backlog. If that's at 100% it implies that even though blocks may be full during busy times, all transactions eventually get included in a block, and therefore the block chain would be exactly the same size as it is now regardless of whether the limit was higher.
(assuming no decided not to broadcast transactions that they would have if the limit was higher)

It's ok if a few do, just as nodes have already dropped out even without a block size increase. The important ones will keep enough hardware resources to keep going. What I'm saying is that it's not in the interests of the miners to wreck the majority of nodes by increasing block sizes too quickly, and the miners can control this with a soft limit (even if the hard limit is high). 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:31:20
I actually made a post about this earlier today: 
@_date: 2015-06-26 23:36:30
I'm half way through his book Digital Gold, it's interesting so far. What impresses me most is that he's obviously done a ton of research to give a detailed account of bitcoin's early history and the story behind all the prominent people in the industry, but the narrative of the book remains very neutral, both in terms of bitcoin's practical advantages and disadvantages, the motivations of the various people involved, and the libertarian political aspect. He does a great job of illustrating both sides of each issue and leaving judgments on those up to the reader.
Basically, he has gathered and illustrated a lot of detailed information on what bitcoin is and the history of the people involved, but I couldn't tell you if Nathaniel is a bitcoiner or a buttcoiner after reading half the book, and that's impressive. usually somoene has a strong opinion one way or another after diving this deep.

@_date: 2015-06-05 18:34:05
Other people have answered your specifics so i won't bother except to point out two other things


This isn't true, while it's likely that mining power will drop off when it's not profitable to mine, and it's likely that mining will increase when it's very profitable to mine, these are not certainties. It is just the tendency of the network.


That is just an assumption, and may or may not be true. 
 
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:05:34
For numbers as large as 1000s, yeah certainly around 2011. I don't know, and maybe I'm wrong but I expect that up until mining went 'industrial' - really when asics took over - you had so many hobbiests, and people who already had the video card hardware from gaming just trying it out. Coins mined in this manner were much more likely to be either kept or lost. No one today is just casually mining a few coins as a novelty or as a hobby, so I see it as an aspect that gradually declined over time.

If this is true and blocks are not hitting the limit now, why do we have any transaction fees right now?
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:06:52
What would the problem be with having no absolute hard limit but effectively allowing the limit to be a percentage increase of the last x blocks mined?
For example if more than 90% of the last 1000 blocks mined were within 10% of the current max size -&gt; allow blocks that are 20% bigger. A kind of self adjusting size like difficulty does.

@_date: 2015-06-16 23:39:42
Yeah, exactly it's a trade-off. The question is whether allowing the majority of miners to dictate the hard limit at any point in time is a reasonable solution. Indeed the impact of an individual miners soft limit is limited, but on the plus side the impact of an individual miner to mine massive blocks (in a manner out of whack with the rest of the miners) is curbed, a short fast rise in the size of blocks is curbed, but should the majority of miners choose to, they can still gradually increase block size over time as needed without another hard fork.

The price rose hugely and then dropped hugely, but not as much as it had risen. This has been a pattern throughout Bitcoin's history.
 &gt; Perhaps there will be another bubble, sure. But that is expectation, not fact...
I won't argue with that, we can't predict the future. I actually think a big bubble is less likely than before, I think slower steady growth is more likely. We can say that demand has matched supply for the last 5 months, we don't know if this will continue or not. We do know that daily supply will half in about 13 months though.

Austerity is hairdressers not being able to retire at 50 with full pensions. As a taxpayer in another EU country who will not be able to retire at 50 why should I contribute my tax to Greece to fund this?

As I see it Bitcoin users are currently either enthusiasts, people that need it as they have no alternative, and speculators. I expect there are almost no casual users. I think most of the enthusiasts, people with no alternative and speculators will  move on to a new crypto rather than walk away from the whole thing if bitcoin failed for some reason that was fixed in the new crypto.
To be clear though, I don't think this will happen, but the threat of it happening is an important incentive for bitcoin to serve its users, as well as its miners.

When I went to buy my first Bitcoin gox was the main exchange, there was already a lot of people doubting it's legitimacy and solvency and recommending to use other exchanges. At least bitstamp and bitcoin.de existed at the time, and I decided not to use gox.
The libertarians had their chance. They could have proved to everyone that gox didn't need to be regulated - that customers would demand things like proof of reserve and that things like multi-sig be used. Instead a huge number of people just kept throwing money into gox until the very end. Then a lot of it happened all over again with Garza.

Armchair economist here, but I find it interesting that there is so much more money, much of it appears to have gone into the stock market, but wages did not rise. The money going into the stock market means it's ultimately going into companies right? Does this mean the companies are hiring more staff at the same wages rather than the wages of existing staff rising, or just that those at the top are keeping the extra money. Where is it actually going?

Do you remember when we switched to the euro? they didn't make the old currencies worthless, they just replaced them, and you could trade the old for the new. 
For Greece to leave the euro similar would happen. All digital money, which is most of it anyway, is switched immediately, people get paid in the new money, merchants accept it and taxes must be paid in it. That's enough to force use of it, no need to do anything to the old euros.

I live in a European country already experiencing austerity. The change needs to be something other than demanding more money from other EU countries that you can't pay back. The problem for Greece is that currently countries like Spain are funding Greece's farce. Greece are effectively saying, we're not going to change pensions. A hairdresser in Greece can retire at 50 with full pension, Greece cannot afford this pension, so it's being funded by borrowed money from Spain and other EU countries. A hairdresser still working at 55 in Spain is paying tax to fund the retired 50 year old hairdresser in Greece. There is no sympathy for Greece from other EU countries because it's not real unavoidable austerity, it's just Greece failing to collect the internal taxes they should and having ridiculous state benefits at the same time.

No single event, unless it's another manic rally, which it might be, but in that case it will be a temporary spike like the the rally to $1000 was anyway.
Otherwise the bear market ends when adoption out paces the monetary inflation of newly mined coins. This gets easier as time goes on as the monetary inflation rate decreases. When people think of adoption they often first think of people having desktop or phone wallets and buying sheets from overstock or a cup of coffee in their local cafe, but I don't think this is how it happens.
Adoption is people holding bitcoin for store of value - the digital gold use-case. It's people using bitcoin for online transactions who have no other choices. it's nerdy hobbiests who like the technology. It's people using bitcoin for libertarian ideological reasons. It's machine to machine transactions. It's bitcoin 2.0 application built on top of bitcoin (possibly a micro-transaction layer). It's black market transactions. It's remittances. It's traders speculating. It's things that haven't been invented yet. It's financial companies using it under the hood for settlement. These all complement each other, it's better to try and think of them together instead of individually.

As I said in the corresponding buttcoin thread, in response to this:


Bitcoin is symbiotic between the users and miners, if it's in the interests of the users to keep it alive, which it is, they have an incentive to pay a fee. We know it can happen because it already does - blocks aren't full right now and many transactions still pay a fee, because it's small enough to not be a big deal to the user. If orders of magnitude more transactions can be in blocks, this can be enough to pay the miners. If it takes a 5c or 10c fee to keep everything running we can do that, make it default in wallets, make it standard in services like circle and coinbase.

Thanks for posting this. I commented already in another thread earlier today that one of the few ways another cryptocurrency could conceivably overtake Bitcoin is if Bitcoin's capacity is severely limited, and/or fees become large enough to become a disincentive to using it. In such a case, Bitcoin being slightly 'more' decentralised or claiming to have more nodes (for the brief time it might before it's overtaken in every aspect) will not matter to the users. They will care first and foremost about having access to make timely transactions and how much those cost.

At the very least I think what they'll take away from it is that Bitcoin seems mathematical/scientific (as opposed to a shady esoteric ponzi), can be a platform for innovation, and a really smart kid from MIT thinks the world of it.

The miners can still use soft limits, raising them only when needed, and to reasonable levels for the majority of nodes. There's a symbiotic relationship between miners and the nodes/users - both want what's best for bitcoin overall. It make no sense for miners to mine, on average, blocks that are 'too big' for bitcoin to function, at the same time it's nice to have the ability to increase block size without a hard fork.

I think a good analogy is to imagine you had 1000 US dollar bills that had serial numbers 0001 to 1000. You start a company and announce to the world publicly that the bills with these serial numbers each represent a share in your company and yearly anyone presenting such a bill can claim 1000th of the yearly dividends.
Now owners of these shares could trade them directly without a stock market - they could sell them on ebay for example and (assuming dollar bills are impossible to counterfeit) anyone buying could easily verify they are buying the real thing by checking the serial number.
Each bill now has a dual purpose, it can used as a regular dollar bill in any store, but it also represents a share in the company, so the real value of it is more than other normal dollar bills.
Coloured coins is just doing this with fractions of a bitcoin instead of dollar bills

You're going to have to accept you're different from most people. Look at all the currencies in the world, how many use SI prefixes? how many depend on simplicity over scientific correctness or scientific convention? It's not an imperial thing, it's a social thing, money needs to appeal to the lowest common denominator in society.
Money isn't just for Spock and Sheldon Cooper, it's for the binman that didn't finish school. 
Bitcoin is different enough conceptually in many other ways, introducing multiple changes of convention and new concepts when introducing anything makes it more difficult. It will help Bitcoin to use denominations similar to those used in all existing currencies around the world

I'm not a fan of the name 'bit' as a unit either, but *something* that's 100 satoshis (or cents) would help adoption from integrating with existing accounting software to not having to explain anything regarding units or unit bias to newcomers.

The question then is whether golds current use as a store of value, despite being unsuitable for daily transactions, is based on the fact that it had scarcity compared to all forms of money that were better for transactions, and if so, how much value will it lose if Bitcoin can provide easy transactions AND scarcity.

The first funding for Google as a company was secured in August 1998 in the form of a US$100,000
Google's initial public offering took place on August 19, 2004. The sale raised US$1.67 billion, and gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.

I think a good analogy is to imagine you had 1000 US dollar bills that had serial numbers 0001 to 1000. You start a company and announce to the world publicly that the bills with these serial numbers each represent a share in your company and yearly anyone presenting such a bill can claim 1000th of the yearly dividends.
Now owners of these shares could trade them directly without a stock market - they could sell them on ebay for example and (assuming dollar bills are impossible to counterfeit) anyone buying could easily verify they are buying the real thing by checking the serial number.

From what I can tell Satoshi didn't do much publicity, there are loads of things he could have done to pump the price or sell Bitcoin the way many evangelists do now. He announced it, he answered questions about it, and he discussed future developments, but he said things like "If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.”
Look at how new altcoins are pumped now, promising the world, pre-mines, having IPOs to directly take funds up front. I see no evidence of Satoshi ever 'pumping' Bitcoin.
He could be dead, but he supposedly came back to post on a forum during the whole Dorian hype saying "I am not Dorian Nakamoto".

Yes, the UI displayed a superficial user-friendly unit denomination because using Satoshis would have been unwieldy. This is purely a user interface issue and this denomination is no longer user friendly as the price of Bitcoin has risen.

well for some reason people felt these units were not enough so instead of just saying 100 Satoshis and using well-known unambiguous units they felt there was a need to create new units such as 'bit'. Not only adding another unit name, but using one which is already used in terms of memory, leading to even more confusion such as your assumption it would be 1/1024. 
On the plus side, people finally using *some* whole unit smaller enough to tip in seems to have revivied tipping, which is a good thing.

It's unlikely any mined Bitcoins were lost, probably just the hardware (which is what the 3.6M refers to) . Mined Bitcoins are credited to a Bitcoin 'address' (think account) and the transactions doing so are instantly shared to all nodes on the network worldwide. So unless the keys for the configured bitcoin address were also kept with the mining hardware and not even backed-up somewhere offsite (which is unlikely), any mined bitcoins are still accessible.

The reason: Because it's easy, Bitcoin is 100% free open source, so you can copy the code, change the name and release your paintedcones-coin alt-coin very easily
The bad: Many people release new coins so that they will have a large portion of the initial share, then try to convince others to buy them. It's a way to take advantage of people who feel they missed the boat with Bitcoin who want to get in early on the next big thing. This speculative gambling often then results in a pump and dump.
The good: Many alt-coins make technical changes, ranging from minor changes to Bitcoin, or completely new coin technologies. This serves as a nice experimental sandbox to try out different features and opposing techniques to Bitcoin and see how they work in real usage. It may ultimately result in a better competitor to Bitcoin, or new features that can be incorporated into Bitcoin.

They didn't want to day trade they just wanted to try bitcoins, it took days to get them and it involved learning about exchanges designed for traders.

You don't know that. Just because the price has not gone up does not mean nothing this year has had a positive effect on the price. Maybe if the large companies were not there the price would currently be under $100. Bitcoin had a lot of bad news this year, enough in my opinion to drive it much lower than it is now if it had not been offset by all the good news we've had. 
Gox going under was a massive event - remember people used to think such an event would be so big to kill Bitcoin but we're still at a price 4 times higher than this time last year. We're in the correction after a bubble, so even if good news trumped bad this year, it wouldn't be weird for the price to be lower than the ATH as long as it was higher than before the last bubble, which it is.

Bitcoiners: people smart enough not to be affected by the psychology of unit bias, but not smart enough to realize how important it is to regular people and do something about it.
At current (and I expect future) prices, it's no longer practical to have the default unit be 1 BTC. 
I bet all it would take is a few of the big companies (coinbase, blockchain, bitstamp etc) to communicate with each other, decide on *something* (mBTC, bits, satoshis, whatever) and announce in advance press release of a future date when they will all change to that default unit. Everyone else would fall in line fairly quickly.

You're thinking at the wrong level. The Bitcoin equivalent to those is Circle, Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain.info. It doesn't matter if Circle replace Coinbase - it's still Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-13 18:08:51
Here are some possibilities:
* Transaction volume is high enough to support enough miners.
* If Bitcoin has a high value hodlers may mine, even at a mining loss, as part of the cost of securing their coins, as long as it's offset by deflation it would be worth it.
* A significant amount of global finance depends on Bitcoin that governments support contribute to mining as a public service.
* As a last resort Bitcoin evolves to proof of stake or some other mining mechanism that works better in the context of smaller or no block rewards. 
Keep in mind also, it doesn't make sense to consider this in terms of the current state of Bitcoin, by the time this becomes an issue Bitcoin will have matured - so it'll be a lot bigger and different than it is now, or it'll be already dead.

We believe that the combination of pure unforgeability, portability, scarcity, divisibility and fungability make Bitcoin valuable in itself, as these are the properties required for something to function as money. Gold emerged as money as it was the closest natural occurring thing to having all these properties. Bitcoin is designed from the ground up to have these properties and does them better than gold. That's it.
EDIT: there is a cost to producing Bitcoin, just as there is a cost to mining gold, but this is justified by the use of it as money - it provides a useful funciton to people as money. The more it is used as money (the more transfers people make, the more value is transacted) the more the initial cost of production is justified. That's what I took from the original Szabo post.

People are also suspicious of things being scams - especially things that are hyped and have seen a big price rise. I think it's fundamental to highlight that it is an invention not a product, a company or something controlled by anyone. Just saying that it's decentralized isn't enough to get this across for regular people. It needs to be clear that Satoshi does not control it, cannot shut it down and cannot just make free coins for himself.
I feel like this aspect is never highlighted enough in media spots or interviews.

Also $950 a coin for the syndicate sounds crazy. The syndicate is for people not wanting to bid on a full block of 3000 (or else they could bid themselves directly and avoid SMs 5% fee) You can buy 2500 coins right now on stamp for $660. Bidding significantly higher than market price in the syndicate seems like an unnecessarily expensive way to buy coins.

I see this as the first hurdle with explaining Bitcoin to people, you tell them it's decentralized but they don't understand that this means no company, no product, no person in charge, no single point of failure. 
None of us would use Bitcoin if it wasn't decentralized, and just saying that it's 'decentralized' doesn't get the point across. so remember to be explicit about what this means when explaining it to people. I find it's also a great way to make them curious, as the next question is usually - "how can it work then?"

People called bitcoin a joke (and still do) and they called it evil because it was used on the silk road. But Bitcoin and Dogecoin are amoral - neither good or evil, it's just money. Similarly Dogecoin is neither serious nor a joke, it's just money, with a meme-based name which leads to viral marketing.
As long as it works as money and the code is solid, the name or coin logo doesn't matter apart from how it affects adoption. All evidence so far is showing that Dogecoin has grown faster than any crypto ever. 
Any diehard ideological fan of crypto wants crypto, in general, to succeed  i.e. the best coins should rise to the top in a free market, and for the idea of crypto to reach as many people as possible as soon as possible. Any greedy speculator wants only the coins they hold to succeed.

The more I think about this, the more I like the idea of building units upwards from Satoshis, instead of dividing downwards from Bitcoin for a couple of reasons:
* 1,000,000 of something is just much nicer to use and easier to read than .0000001 of something, Especially as the number of 0s increases. Most People are already more familiar with million as a unit than micro, especially in terms of money.
* The term 'Bitcoin' already represents too many things - the invention, the network and the currency unit. Moving to using Satoshi as the unit helps remove some of the confusion here. I think it would be easier to explain to people Satoshis are the units in the Bitcoin payment system.
* Satoshi is already an established, unambiguous denomination. There's no confusion with it.

You're the duffus who decided to part with it, now realized how it may lead to confusion but, instead of going back to the standard, you want everyone to change like you did?"

How is it anything like Apple? If Steve Jobs and Woz had anonymously posted the open source design for people to build their own Apple computers online I would have said they were not about greed - this is effectively what Satoshi did. in fact Linus Torvalds with Linux or Richard Stallman before him with GNU are much better comparisons, and I do not believe they were motivated by greed.

Also, I agree of course the mining rewards are just one aspect of what determines the price, but it as at least a reason for some downward pressure if it exceeds new adoption.

Bitcoin can be used as money directly, there's technically no need to withdraw anything. In practical terms, because it's early days still, Bitcoin is not accepted by the majority of merchants, so the receiver would probably want to convert it to their local currency. How easy this is depends on the country, but something like bitpesa in Kenya is an example of the possibilities.

Bitcoin (the payment system/store of value) is the product, not bitcoins themselves. Just how a payment system is the product of mastercard or visa, not little plastic cards. I can use your argument just as easily against traditional credit cards;
Plastic cards is the product that is being sold for a profit in itself. The only reason credit card companies exists is to produce credit cards, which are used to make transactions within the credit card system, which give credit card producers something to create. It's a loop. It's a closed system with no external meaning or value generation.

You can make it look and behave (in terms of any software, forms etc that deal with prices or amounts) just like them by using similar unit denominations. It's one less barrier to adoption.

Right, so since miners charging users $45 per transaction isn't an option as it would effectively kill bitcoin, they'll do something else - either stop mining (which increases the income of the remaining miners), or accept low enough transactions fees. 
I also think 2030 is light years away in Bitcoin terms, we have no idea what the operating costs of mining a block a day would be, what the price of BTC will be, or how many transactions per day there will be. Only an idiot would try to predict any of these things, let alone all of them.

Not strictly, but 100 people could all 'own' Bitcoin and have it kept on an exchange like Bitstamp where it's kept in 1 Bitcoin address until they withdraw their share. Whether you really consider this case as 1 user or 100 users is debatable of course :) but the point is a user may have many coins at many addresses and an address may contain coins belonging to many users, so you can't derive the number of users from the number of addresses holding coins.

It seems more likely to me that a hobbiest who happened to have a decent graphics card already might have mined a couple of hundred Bitcoins and lost them or just held them without any real need to sell due to mining costs back then than someone investing in the hardware would today to mine anything close to that would today. Therefore I think it's more likely that more immediate selling pressure comes from mining today than it did then.

I've never called it a centidollar or centieuro and never seen cUSD or cEUR. But for what it's worth, I think it would be no harm to call satoshi a cent if we moved to 'bits' (or whatever 100sat unit). It would be familiar to many people already.

Obviously under pressure from law enforcement, probably to help find coins of known silk road dealer addresses or something. Unless you think Bitstamp voluntarily want to spend time and money annoying/losing their customers with all this KYC stuff? 
If you don't think Bitstamp are voluntarily doing this, then why get mad at them, they're victims of your own laws, regulations and governments. Work to change the system or leave the system if you want to do something, I don't see how getting mad at Bitstamp will help.

There's nothing unfair about that. Bitcoin isn't a closed system. When it was cheaper anyone was free to learn about it, mine it, choose to receive it in exchange for goods or services or buy it. That some people made the effort to discover it, champion it and took the leap (with bigger risk than there is now) to get involved earlier gives them their reward, same with early precious metal miners, same with venture capitalists or early share purchasers in successful companies.
There is still the chance to be among the first 0.1% of people to get Bitcoin, whether people want to take that leap is still up to them.

You want to use Satoshi? that's crazy because you never see any argument over what a satoshi represents, it's already established, it's small enough to not need to be changed again even if bitcoin gets huge and it's not a word that can easily be confused with the unit of bitcoin itself, it's also not a word used to represent anything else in the world....... if we used Satoshi as the unit there'd never be all the debate in threads like this, where would be the fun in that?

I'm saying that if you try to change too much you may fail to change anything, or at least seriously delay adoption. Sometimes it's better to be pragmatic than correct.
Look at linux on the desktop for an example. Sure who needs a graphical file browser right? the terminal is better, it's quicker to use the keyboard than the mouse, it's relatively standard in all distributions. just pop open a terminal and type 'ls' to see your files. People will get used to it right? Well, wrong, they just see something too different from what they are familiar with and ignore it. 
I think the time it would take to explain unit bias, and the differences between unit denominations between bitcoin and regular currency might actually take the same amount of time as the elevator pitch explaining what bitcoin is, and that's both bad and unnecessary.

Personally, firstly I think BTC is a great online payment system, it's already achieved perhaps the hardest part by growing the ecosystem to a non-trivial size from nothing, and now lots of companies are working hard on taking it forward from here. Secondly I think crypto is better than gold at nearly all the things that make gold good as money e.g. portability, scarcity, verifiability, fungability, divisability.
Forgetting every other use of Bitcoin, if it just captured 1% of the gold market that's $10k a coin right there.

There was two levels of risk, investing in a .com company was betting that the Internet as a technology would succeed and that the specific company would succeed. You had to take both these levels of risk, as it wasn't really possible to invest in the technology itself directly.
With Bitcoin you can choose to just invest in the technology by buying coins, or you can take both levels of risk (for possibly greater gains) by investing in a crypto company. There's also a third kind of level in crypto - alt coins.

Not a UI developer either, and I haven't studied how other wallets do it. But some general techniques would be: 1) Don't show QR codes for "addresses I sent to" by default (maybe user has to explicitly enable this display). 2) show receiving addresses and addresses you sent to in different screen areas e.g. left side versus right side 3) show receiving and sending addresses in different colours or styles e.g. green in, red out.  4) give explicit pop-ups warning users when they're doing something likely to result in sending coins to a place they don't want to by accident.

No one is going to use 8 decimals for prices, in fact I doubt even 3 decimal places will be common. We will build units up from Satoshis and not down from 1 BTC. The system will change to suit users, not the other way around imho.

I see where you're coming from, but Bitcoin has such a head-start that I think it effectively is strongly linked to the success of the technology in general now and that both the crypto-related companies and the alts fit into the category that the dot com companies did i.e. most will fail, any that succeed will give huge rewards.
It can change that Bitcoin is no longer in that position, but at this stage it would take a huge event.

* 1 SAT = 1 Satoshi
* 1 kSAT = 1,000 Satoshi
* 100 kSAT = 100,000 Satoshi
* 1 mSAT = 1,000,000 satoshi

I think these units cover everything we need, and come with the added advantage over the OP that they are multiples and not subdivisions of a unit which is more familiar to users of existing currencies.

Current currency systems already use arbitrary random unit names so it isn't a problem. No problem with the decimal system either as long as it's only using 2 places like is common already with currencies.
In general people have no problem with large amounts in denominations of whole numbers, and are unfamiliar with decimal numbers with more than 2 places.
People will easily know the difference between 1,000,000 and 100k in many currencies. Less will be able to easily tell the difference 0.000001 and 0.0000001.

I meant Bitcoin, right now at least. I would lump alt-coins in with crypto currency companies as things that may come or go. At this stage Bitcoin has such a headstart as the leading protocol that buying coins is like buying pieces of HTTP or SMTP in the dotcom era.
Besides, if an alt-coin does start to gain traction for whatever reason, or a new coin with some amazing advantages over bitcoin appears, I can just diversify into that. It's not like we'll just wake up one day and there'll instantly be a more popular coin (unless Bitcoin technology fails completely), it would take quite some time for adoption.

From a feedback cycle related to ** showing that Bitcoin becomes more useful (and therefore more valuable) the more users it has, this leads to bubbles, which leads to euphoria, evangelising and media attention which leads to more users - back to step 1. It has been following this cycle so far, and still only a tiny percentage of the potential users are users, leaving still huge scope for further cycles. There is no guarantee of anything of course.

No need for the conversation to stop. You just say that a really large computer network (the miners) agree by majority every 10 minutes on what the latest transactions are. They get rewarded with the new coins as they come into circulation. This solves the problems of how to validate and secure the transactions, and how to fairly distribute new coins.

I think the main thing Bitcoin has going for it is that the companies already all went with Bitcoin. Under what circumstance do you think you login to coinbase and they've migrated while everyone else is still on Bitcoin? Who would do it first and why? I know they *technically* could do it, I just can't see how it would happen without either some insurmountable failure in Bitcoin, or some coin so far ahead of Bitcoin that there is consensus among a majority to switch to it (in which case - yay! we found a much better crypto).
EDIT: basically I see it as a chicken and egg thing. Companies won't switch until a coin is big enough, and a coin can't easily get big enough without the companies switching.

Hi, i presume these questions are about bitcoin itself? I'll start with the easiest, miners can put as many transactions as they like in a block up as far as the block size limit (currently 1 megabyte). They will have heard about recent transactions from other nodes on the network who share them, the transactions originally come from user wallets. Miners include them because it's good for bitcoin, and because they get to keep any fee attached to any transactions they include.
How transactions get created in a way that can be verified is more complex, and is missing from this chandler-chain example in this thread.
Understanding it first involves understanding some magic you can do with cryptographic math. Anyone can create a public/private key pair, lets say for example you do and the public key is "abcd" and the private key is "1234". There is some maths you can do that will 'sign' a message (think of it like the hash function used in the blocks)  providing a signature specific to the message and those keys. The magic here is that you could give me, the public key (abcd) the message and the signature and I can *know* that you signed it with the private key even though I don't know that the private key is '1234'. I know this is a lot to grasp, but bear with me.
If you combine this signed message concept with the blockchain concept, it means we can create a history of blocks made up of signed messages (the transactions). Messages can say that they intend to transfer balances of coins from one public key to another. We can know what the balance of any public key is by adding/subtracting all transactions in the block history related to it. And only the person who owns the private key for a public key.
We know that a secure, incorruptible history of transactions that allows the owners of balances to make new transactions can be used as a system for money - even if it's all digital, after all this is how most money nowadays exists in banks. So a blockchain can be used as a money system.
can sign messages transferring any of the balance at that key to another one.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:37:22
In real bitcoin the longest chain wins. So you had a valid block 7 but so did someone else. They win because they are part of the longest chain - 8 used their hash as the 'previous' value, and someone else built a block 9 on top of that.

I think that Satoshi knew people wouldn't adopt Bitcoin for altruistic reasons, which is why he designed it with such drastic block reward decreases and with such a large percentage of the coins being minted relatively early in the mining lifetime. Bitcoin was designed to appeal to human greed, to appeal to speculators. He may have preferred that it didn't, but recognised that it had to to gain critical mass.
Does anyone know if he ever spoke about his design choices in this regard? It's one thing I'd really love to hear his opinion on.

One of the biggest arguments and detractions by newbs is that Bitcoin is 'too expensive' -  "I wish I had bought some when it was cheap". Using smaller units solves this psychological issue. Removing every little barrier to adoption is important.
Probably all it would take for this to happen would be Circle, Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain, Bitstamp, Xapo to commit to some future day (Bit-day) when they will switch their default unit. If enough companies committed everyone else would follow. Bit-day - make it happen! It could even be a media event.

You're not asking me but yes I do, because Bitcoin *is* a decentralized system. The fact that it's not viable for some people to run miners or nodes or every user to download the entire blockchain is just an inevitability of Bitcoin growing. It doesn't surprise me that Bitcoin is growing into a system distributed more among Bitcoin services companies and large scale professional miners than hobbyists, and I don't have a problem with that.

Bitcoin won't be replaced without the whole bitcoin ecosystem being replaced, that means A) all the major companies, software and users switching to a different crypto or B) all the major companies being replaced by alternatives.
A) after seeing how long it is taking for the community to reach consensus on what smaller units should be used for bitcoins, I'm not worried that any kind of consensus would be reached quickly for switching to another coin, how would the majority choose a single one out of the 1000s out there? Bitcoin would be fixed before it would happen.
B) would take a long time, years. In which case there's plenty of time to switch.

Some possible outcomes:
1) The whitelisting/blacklisting never happens to a large enough degree to matter, and bitcoin remains fungible as it is in general now.  
2) The whitelisting/blacklisting happens, most users don't care and bitcoin lives on regardless.  
3) There is a technical change in, or on top of, the Bitcoin  protocol to counter-act this.  
4) A crypto which does not allow such tracing (Monero?) replaces or is used alongside bitcoin for those concerned by this issue  
5) It kills bitcoin and all other crypto-currency, we all pack up and go home.

Ok, so at the time of writing the chain is 10 blocks long. There was a single transaction in each block, saying who solved it. Here's the ordered transaction history of block solvers we get from the chandler-chain:
Block  | Solver
1|KoKansei 
So what's the use of this ? Firstly we know and can prove the blocks were solved in this order - anyone can trace back through the previous hashes in each block and verify the solutions even  if they only had the blocks themselves and could not see the reddit comments or timestamps.
It's important to know some things about the hashes themselves. No matter what data or how much data you put in a block, the hash will always be the same length, it will be seemingly random and it cannot be predicted. The only way to find a solution for a block that gives a specific pattern of hash and wins the game is by trial and error - there are no shortcuts. Changing any character in a block will change the answer hash, making the solution invalid. 
This has a couple of neat consequences: we can regulate the rate blocks are solved (regardless of how many people are trying) by making the necessary answer hash more specific. Block 2 only needed any hash starting with a 0 - easy  it was solved quickly. Block 10 needed one starting with two 0s - it took longer to find a solution. Here's a recent hash from a real bitcoin block, how much work do you think you need to do making random guesses to find this with 17 leading 0s:


Secondly, it means that work is needed to make every block, and this means that if someone wanted to corrupt the chain - to change history - for example to say peter123 solved block 2 instead of shludvigsen they would need to find a new solution for that block AND every block after it as the "previous" value in each block would change making their current solutions invalid. 
If everyone takes the longest chain as the correct record of history, and there is lots of work being done to mine that chain making it longer all the time, we end up with a secure incorruptible history of blocks.
One additional thing, at the time block 5 was mined, it was impossible to predict who would solve block 8 or what the hash would be. On something as large as the bitcoin blockchain with massive amounts of work needed to solve each block, deciding in advance to use the hash of a specific future block as a random number gives a provably fair random number. is using this to pick their winners.
chandler-chain demonstrates the idea of a block-chain and shows how hashing and mining works. It's obviously not a full crypto-currency though as it's missing other aspects such blocks being shared among distributed nodes, automated block creation and verification (we were doing it by hand) and it doesn't have it's own native token - I was tipping block rewards manually via changetip. The public/private key transaction mechanism is completely missing from chandler-chain.

except many people are not, and no one is using them in terms of any existing currency unit. But many people are used to using 1000s, 10,000s and millions in terms of money. I expect many more people know what a millionaire is than a millimetre. Therefore why not use satoshi, ksatoshi = 1000 satoshi, msatoshi - 1,000,000 satoshi.

It's difficult to ELI5, but I've been thinking about it a long time, and even this idea of the manual mining is over a year old but I didn't get around to doing it until now. 
The first aspect of mining that confuses people is the work. They think the 'difficult math problems' are fundamentally needed to create bitcoins, when really they are just arbitrary and needed to artificially make work so that there is a proof of work and blocks are expensive to create. 
I've been thinking about how to try and explain the need for proof of work, as generally in society we try to optimise things to need less work, so bitcoin immediately fights against your intuition by creating arbitrary work. Here's the best I've come up with:
Imagine you run a radio show, it's an hour long, you want to run a raffle at the end of your show for your listeners so that a random listener wins a prize. You want to allow all your listeners to enter anonymously by email but you also would like that each listener only enters once, or at least not 1000s of times with throwaway email addresses. How can you do this?
Let the person you're explaining this to think about it for a while, I guess they'll have no solution? because i think this needs proof of work to be solved. Forget hashing etc, explain proof of work with a simple example:
Imagine as the radio DJ you have access to unlimited different soduku puzzles that each take 45 mins for a human to solve. You let each listener email you and get a soduku in response. To enter the raffle they must submit a completed sudoko by the end of the show.  
The sudoko is proof of work, it replaces the need for identity verification. it doesn't matter that it's actually sudoko or a chess puzzle or  finding the nonce for a block hash, it just has to be a proof of work.

I think you're making a mistake in thinking of it as Bitcoin 'paying' $650m for mining security. Even if mining was not needed at all, someone would need to get these $650m of new coins, they need to be created and distributed fairly. This is a problem that POW mining solves, not the other way around.
Also Satoshi mined a lot of coins, but it was still fair. They weren't pre-mined, anyone else was free to mine as soon as he did.

I don't know how to account for it. If we wanted to prove that he would never use them, he could have sent them to a specific address to destroy them, but he did not do that. These are the possibilities:
1. he has lost the keys to them and cannot spend them. Satoshi has proved to be  smart and forward thinking so this seems unlikely to me.
2. he will spend some, cash some or all out whenever he feels like it for selfish reasons.
3. he will sell it all out of spite as an attack on Bitcoin because he dislikes what it becomes.
4. he will be altruistic and give some to charity/poor, or just even distribute them some other way among a wide group of people.
5. he has not decided what to do with them yet.
6. he has decided he will never spend/sell them, but keeps the keys in case he changes his mind.

Maybe because the annual monetary inflation is still close to 10%, i.e. we need to 10% growth just to maintain the current price. When you consider that many old coins are effectively out of the market ecosystem (e.g. all of Satoshis coins, the Winklevii coins) that 10% of new coins may act more like 20% or 30%. This is a short/mid-term thing though, already in less than 2 years  (EDIT: more like 1.5, see other comments below) we'll be down to about 3% annual monetary inflation. Unless Bitcoin stops gaining adoption it's only a matter of time before adoption demand surpasses monetary inflation.

I know that the unit bias is a huge turn-off for people the first time they encounter Bitcoin. I experienced it myself, I saw numerous people get on the dogecoin train because bitcoin was "too expensive", I've had it from many people I talk to about Bitcoin. I know that not many people know what power of ten micro means, that not many people know if m is a prefix for milli or micro and have no idea what 'mu' is, that any amount of money that uses a denomination of less than 1/100th of a unit seems strange and foreign to people, and when I'm explaining it now they're sidetracked thinking about that, instead of thinking about more interesting aspects of Bitcoin.
I also know that all the above is unnecessary to explain if we're pragmatic and just call 100 satoshis *something* and go with it.

Why? For a long time it was the best natural resource that fulfilled the necessary properties for money: scarcity, portability, fungability, easy to recognize, hard to counterfeit, divisible.
It makes complete sense that it emerged as a common money, it also makes sense that fiat replaced much of its use as it improves on the weakest of these traits - portability and divisibility.
And once you think like this, it seem inevitable that crytocurrency will replace much of the use of fiat and gold, as it improves on both overall in terms of these traits.

Yeah, there's many possible solutions at such an easy difficulty. I don't know exactly how miners choose their nonce guesses to be honest, but I imagine it might be by just starting with a random number and keep incrementing it.

People often confuse not being "legal tender" with being illegal. It's important to note the difference. Being illegal would mean no one is allowed use it for anything. Being legal tender would mean that any debt payment or payment for products/services can be made with BTC - it would *force* companies to accept it as payment.
Personal cheques, credit cards, debit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender either, it does not mean it's illegal to use them or accept them as payment.

People aren't just leaving because they're angry or rage quitting, they're also leaving because bitcoin isn't doing what they want it to do.
At an attempt to phrase this in an impartial way: Core is saying 


People leaving are saying:


This isn't necessarily based on anger, or personal attacks, or conspiracy theories or whatever, at the heart of it it's a simple disagreement that can't be proved correct either way, and it's people voting with their feet. There's no point getting angry about it either.
If it continues, there probably comes a point where people begin to weigh up the risk of more people leaving versus the risk of compromising though, especially miners if the price continues to drop.

Despite him showing the trezor (which was great btw! well done on the forethought to have it handy) I can't help feeling it was a missed opportunity to stress further that 3rd parties like exchanges are not mandatory for storing bitcoin.
People hear bitstamp, a bitcoin exchange is hacked and they think that the bitcoin equivalent of banks are just as bad, if not worse, therefore there's no point to bitcoin.
I would have clarified that anyone who did not have bitcoin kept on bitstamp or any other exchange cannot lose their bitcoin by bitstamp or any other exchange being hacked.

Well, myself and my countrymen chose the government system we have after we gained independence. If we don't like the government officials we vote in others, so they are answerable to the people in order to keep their job - they have some incentive to keep the people happy and some accountability. What they spend our taxes on is reasonably transparent. I'm also free to leave the country if I don't like it.
I don't think my government is perfect, far from it, and I'm hoping Bitcoin removes control of money from it, as there's no longer a need for that and the less things we have to control by government the better, but I just don't see a better alternative to policing/law yet.

I agree, but you need to know what Bitcoin and cryptocurrency even are to get that far, and it's why we see a lot of Shibes eventually gravitate towards Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-05-24 00:57:14
I agree that only a tiny tiny percentage of people will ever understand how bitcoin works on a technical level, but people generally learn to understand the value proposition of technology. I doubt many goldbugs know on physics/chemistry level why gold can't easily be transmutated from lead or why it can't easily be manufactured like plastic, but yet they'll know and accept that it can't be. People don't know how their fridge stays cool, but they know if they leave the door open or plug it out that it no longer will behave that way.
In summary, people may learn what properties bitcoin has and how it behaves without knowing anything about how it works. It's also possible that like TCP/IP they'll be using it without even knowing they are using it.

I stand by what I said, the leading cryptocurrency is defined by finding the longest valid chain in the one cryptocurrency with the highest value (marketcap - whatever you want to call it). This is how we define bitcoin as the leading currency, and how we know which transactions 'count' as bitcoin.

Within the cryptocurrency with the highest market cap there may be multiple competing chains that start with the same gensis block, and either follow the same rules or do not (though if they are considered the same coin in terms of price they probably do). In any case the longest one (technically one with the most work) is the one considered to have consensus.

@_date: 2016-01-25 19:03:15
It's important though, because consensus forms at multiple levels. At one level it's decided by the software the economic actors decide to run, after that, the miners within that system construct the longest valid chain compatible with that software. People are failing to understand how both of these concepts determine what bitcoin (or the leading cryptocurrency if you want to generalise) is. It's not a decision anyone can make, it's not something that can be dictated. A consensus emerges every day on a valid chain of the most popular cryptocurrency, and it will continue to regardless of debate or civil war or forks.

Another aspect is that in addition to the balance of power within the bitcoin ecosystem as you have described there are also some external players:
traditional payment systems and alt-coins help keep bitcoin honest through competition. 
For example even if all bitcoin players tried to force higher fees by keeping blocks smaller than technically possible (as a hypothetical ;) example ) it is inevitable that a cryptocurrency without that restriction would emerge and appeal as an alternative to new users.

Yes, any change the economic majority (the holders, users, miners and exchanges) want to make. This is good. 
If you think the economic majority are too stupid to make decisions about the future of bitcoin and that a select few elites should get to choose what is best for them, then well stick to fiat, the government and the Fed eh?
This is also not a new concept, it's been clear from day one that bitcoin will always be what the economic majority decide it is. There is no social contract, guarantee by Satoshi or immutable code.

Forget politics and conspiracy theories, it's simpler than that. People are leaving. If you don't believe me look at the data. They're leaving this subreddit, the proof is that an alternative has more traction than ever. They're leaving core, the proof is that an aternative implementation has more traction than ever. They're leaving bitcoin entirely, the proof is that an alternative crypto has a higher percentage of the overall value in the space than ever before.
This is decentralisation in the free market. No one can control this. If users are not happy they leave.

There is never consensus. Some people will always want litecoin or dogecoin instead of bitcoin. What is always clear is what the economic majority want - it's defined by the longest chain of the highest value. It currently is, and has always been a specific bitcoin chain of blocks.
In future it may be a different fork of the bitcoin blockchain, or an alt-coin. But it will always be clear, and I suspect over any significant time frame the leader will always be far ahead of 2nd place. No one can stop the emergence of the most valuable chain being whatever the economic majority decide, not miners, not core devs, not forum mods. This is the power of cryptocurrency being permissionless and decentralised.

Good comment. I agree, I think it would have to be something launched by one or many powerful companies. There are many issues with this though and time is ticking as Bitcoin gains more adoption. Look at ApplePay for example, no one else is free to innovate with it, so no other tech companies care about it. Some retailers are hostile towards it as they don't want to give Apple a cut. I think something to rival Bitcoin would not only have to be technically amazing, but also unite a significant amount of companies together in one effort. It's not impossible I guess, but I don't see it on the horizon either anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:12:25
I don't think that ever happens, because I think the crypto (or cryptos) that is used for transactions most will also be the one that is most used as digital gold. This is already playing out as transactions are spilling over from bitcoin to other cryptos, those cryptos are drawing more speculative trading and hodling.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:08:04

Sure that can happen gradually, but why worry about that? If any coin gets to 25% of Bitcoin market cap, just move 25% of your bitcoin to that and you'll have hedged accordingly. Bitcoin is so big now that a coin gaining on it to any significant degree will take a long time and there will be time to react to it.
I'm not even sure that many (any?) of the big services except exchanges are even bothering with using other coins concurrently, Circle, Coinbase. Bitpay, Xapo?
@_date: 2016-01-03 00:46:05
that's an interesting question, because the 1% who own 99% (if that's true) have the most to lose by bitcoin being surpassed by a competitor, and the 99%, who out number them have more to gain. Think about that with respect to what bitcoin companies (who make ~per-user income, and may rely on network effect for growth) may do when faced with a choice of which coin/fork to follow, would it be the one of the elite or the one of the many?

geographic distribution perhaps?


Is that centralized or decentralized?
When you say control, what do you mean? Is it open source? Do people have their own private keys, is mining open to anyone? Are new tokens issued from a central authority?
If the answers to those questions are as they should be, then you can't steal anyones money and people can fork away from you and your friends and run it in a different country if they want, so yes it counts as decentralised, otherwise it doesn't
I guess maybe my main point is the decentralisation is defined by potential power the users have, not the extent to which they are currently exercising that power - a natural monopoly is fine if everyone is happy.

I've previously described the concept separately from bitcoin. Imagine you ran a radio show and you wanted to raffle a prize for your listeners, without them having to prove their identity to you. You also want to allow everyone to enter by email, but also ensure someone doesn't spam you with loads of fake entries by creating lots of different email addresses? Tough problem.
Now imagine you have lots of sudoku puzzles. Enough so that there's at least one per listener. each of them takes a human about an hour to solve, and there's no way this can be automated or done quicker by a computer or anything like that.
The solution is you announce that the sudokus are available on request by email and that the closing time for entry to the raffle by submitting a solution is an hour or so later. Now each person only has time to get one soduku, solve it and enter.
This general type of principle is called proof-of-work. The actual work being done isn't what's important, just that we know it takes a certain amount of time and resources to do, that it can't be short-cut and that the solution can be quickly verified.
In this example we used proof-of-work instead of identity verification to avoid spam and fraud. This is a powerful concept.
Bitcoin is an open system, where anyone can participate without identity verification, the process of doing the work for the proof-of-work is called mining. Bitcoin uses this proof-of-work mining to solve two problems:
1) To regulate how often blocks of new transactions (like ledger pages) are added to the ledger which stops conflicts and provides a high cost to attempting to spam or falsify transactions
2) It regulates how often new coins are awarded, and ensures it's done in a fair way. A fixed amount of new coins are awarded to a miner when they've successfully done the work to add a block. If the work is being done too fast it adjusts to make the work harder (like making the sudokus more complex), and vice versa if it's taking too long.

I think it's clear that 'Blockchain' had a fairly straightforward definition in the context of bitcoin when the word was coined as bitcoin was invented.
Since then people are experimenting with systems that are different than bitcoin but share some of the characteristics of bitcoin. It's subjective how much you can add or take away from bitcoin and still have a 'blockchain' right now, but over time as the dust settles we'll end up with a more precise definition, even if that ends up being more or less what it started as in bitcoin.

Buying coins on the open market is fair, as is mining them in the early days, both ways you're putting your money where your mouth is at least. Creating a cryptocurrency and just assigning yourself most of the coins is the least fair distribution, but I take your point I guess we can't proclaim something not a cryptocurrency on that metric alone.
But that's not my only criteria anyway, when I first got into crypto Ripple wasn't even fully open source. It seems now it is ( so maybe it is properly decentralised. I don't know enough about it to say either way.

I was, and I liked the idea of changetip, I received some tips and I payed them forward though I never deposited any of my own bitcoin, but it's a bad fit with libertarians as tipping isn't in their self interest, naturally.
The best use of changetip was probably Even then it was going to need waaay more users than just bitcoiners to be sustainable  and whether it's bitcoin being too obscure/complex, bad marketing or just a lack of interest they never got the general public to catch on to it.
It wouldn't surprise me if some form of internet tipping emerges eventually, especially when people get more used to zapping money around on their phones one way or another.

I don't think any major exchange will do something not in their economic interest. The exchanges will be on the side of the majority. Coins on the other fork will be worthless or close enough to it as they won't be tradable on an exchange.

I'm no expert, but are you sure the Chinese exchanges do not do large USD/BTC volumes, for example on  okcoin is listed 2nd for USD.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:29:22
And the coins they did mine every 100 minutes would most likely not be sellable anywhere - I can't see a situation where the exchanges are operating on a different fork from 90% of the miners. This is why I don't think we'll have a fork worth worrying about. Either XT will be adopted completely or it won't (because we don't need it, for whatever reason).

Correct. This is why Apple made fewer iphones. Fewer products earns more money (lower production costs, fewer returned products and potentially higher price per item due to scarcity). I believe in the end they made about 100 phones.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:54:08
Firstly on being able to guess a private key: The number of possible private keys is enormous, every possible one will not be used to create a bitcoin address, so just guessing one will never be sufficient. In fact guessing them at a massive rate forever you'll still never (statistically) guess one that's an actual bitcoin address with coins in it.


This is incorrect, every possible key will not be used for an address holding bitcoins, not even close.
Secondly, public/private key cryptography is like magic. It's some amazing maths (not specific to just bitcoin). It means that if I have the private key for a public address, I can prove to you that I have it (by signing a transaction) WITHOUT telling you what the private key is. So people do NOT tell anyone else what their private key is when they make transactions, this is one aspect of the trust-less nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:20:50
It's symbiotic, the users need miners, and the miners need users.

@_date: 2016-02-11 15:28:32


I disagree that everyone is equal. If I decide to run a node with different validation rules it has a lot less impact than if the largest exchange decides to do the same thing. Similarly all miners are not equals, their influence depends on their hash rate. Similarly you could consider a rare highly skilled dev more influential than any particular small time user. A holder with 100k coins has more influence than someone hodling 0.25. 
And I don't mean any of the above in terms of political influence, I mean actual ability to have a concrete effect on the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-07-25 09:54:11

Some gambling has an element of skill, especially poker, and to a lesser extent sports betting. This can give as much value-for-money entertainment as other things you'd spend disposable income on, and of course there's also a chance you win anyway. Anything I bet is small and I consider it  money spent on entertainment. Day trading bitcoin is another form of this gambling.
Then there's pure chance based gambling, I've no interest in it. You're certain to lose in the long run and there's no skill aspect to act as a mental challenge so I get no entertainment from it.

"blockchain without bitcoin" which is usually how interprets it when someone says the blockchain technology is more important than the currency, but I think it's a bad interpretation. What I think people saying this mean is that they don't think Bitcoin makes it as an end user currency, but that blockchain based applications and services will be successful in the back-end, and even by users who don't know they are using bitcoin. The end user has no exposure to the price volatility or security risks of personally holding bitcoin as they are not directly using the currency.

Firstly, becoming the 'primary payment system' is a whole other level, which I wasn't talking about. Bitcoin can be a somewhat widely accepted mainstream system without ever being a primary one.
If a large enough number of people are using bitcoin as digital gold or receiving it via remittances or open bazaar sales or whatever, they may still frequently want to spend it (perhaps just for online purchases), even if it's not their day to day cash for coffee. If it gets to this case I think you'd see merchants accepting it as it'll be more convenient for the users to just spend it directly instead of selling it via an exchange and then spending the fiat. 
The problem bitpay face is that there just aren't enough people who already have bitcoin. They're seeing people that have lots of bitcoin spend it, but there just aren't that many of those people. Merchant acceptance does not increase this pool of people, people need other reasons to obtain bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:54:01
If Bitcoin grows like it needs to, there will be no need to use the old bitcoin unit any more, in the same way that it's rare to need kg for gold. bits, and traditional groupings (k, mm) for it will be the norm. I think the early adopters are smart enough to handle that temporary confusion, and new users would only know of bits so there'd be no confusion.
I would have preferred another name over 'bit' but no-one suggested any alternative that gained enough traction, so here we are, the result of the hive-mind has emerged.

If another crypto overtook bitcoin for use as a payment network (giving it more users, therefore more companies, therefore more miners) why would we not use that crypto as digital gold?  What advantage would bitcoin have over it that you would trade in and out of bitcoin for storage purposes?
My theory is that there will be one leading crytpocurrency, it's currently bitcoin but it's arrogant to think it will certainly always be so (though I do think it's likely), especially if bitcoin becomes more difficult to change than others. Whatever the leading cryptocurrency is, will also be the digital gold standard.
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:45:42


In a vacuum yes, but in the bigger picture it's a necessary step. Bitcoin reaching closed loops is a big step, it's not going to happen quickly. By closed loops I mean: people receiving bitcoin (either as wages, selling things on open bazaar, remittances etc), spending them to merchants, with the merchants then either paying them as wages or to suppliers, without any exchange back to fiat. I think this was the end-game many people considered when they first got excited about bitcoin - bitcoin succeeding as a daily currency for ordinary folks.
It's really hard for this to happen though, it's probably the hardest use-case for bitcoin to succeed in. The price volatility, paradigm shift from fiat, inaccessibility and unforgiving nature of bitcoin are big barriers to the regular joe.
It's easier for bitcoin to succeed as digital gold - easier to store offline, and many who like precious metals already get the motivation behind decentralised money, and aren't afraid to go against the fiat herd. It's easier for bitcoin to succeed as something speculators use as a trading instrument, something black/grey markets use, something used in the back-end by financial institutions and B2B where the average joe doesn't know he's using it indirectly. Similarly it's easier for bitcoin to be a platform for other indirect applications like ascribe or open bazaar.
Here's part 1) of the funny bit though as I see it: Bitcoin HAD to have some success in the original merchant use-case to some degree as a proof of concept that it works - that it is money. It's important that some people have and will use it as a day to day currency, that big companies like MS and Dell started accepting it. even though this never expanded to the average joe doing this, it helped get bitcoin to critical mass for other uses. 
Here's part 2) of the funny bit: If enough of the other use-cases are successful to a large enough degree, it can give bitcoin the critical mass to have a second shot at the original merchant case on a larger scale. For this to happen the infrastructure will have to have reached a point where it's rock solid, it'll need the lightening network or something like it for scalability, it'll need user-friendly idiot proof wallets, it'll need to have been around for over a decade so it's no longer new and scary. It'll need either good enough services for hedging volatility or to have grown to a market cap large enough that price is no longer too volatile for acceptable daily use. Only then can the loops close.
(Disclaimer: as someone that tries to be a bitcoin-realist, I'm aware what I've described above is the uber-bull case, and I wouldn't claim to be able to predict the chance of it happening, but I do think it's possible)

The market cap of gold is estimated to be 7 trillion, the likely majority of that acting as money, as a store of value. 
You have a choice. You can buy paper gold, where it's fast to transact, where you don't need to worry about transaction delays or expensive physical storage for it. Or you can have physical gold, where it's definitely limited in supply and immune to counter party risk.
Bitcoin can give the best of both worlds. Bitcoin can be a better gold to that trillion dollar market.

Not direct access, but perhaps indirect access, by aggregating many of their transactions into a few on chain transactions. As long as this still offers the benefits of bitcoin such as trustless, cheap, timely settlement and permision-less it's still useful.

Not until it's stable enough, and been around long enough to trust. Companies will send emails even though they leave their systems and they can't guarantee they'll reach recipients.

Hal's early interactions with Satoshi make him more likely to be Satoshi (or at least in cahoots with him) in my opinion. As I understand it, Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cypherpunk mailing list but at first did not get much positive reaction or feedback from the list members... Hal was the first to respond enthusiastically, asking a lot of leading questions and asking for confirmations on assumptions, making the exchange between them look like a great FAQ about what was so good about Bitcoin, kind of like a less obvious early version of the "Woah, what just happened here?" changetip shill comments we've seen.

The advantage gold had was that the currencies that could be more easily shipped did not have finite supply. So there was always a trade off between ease of use and decentralisation.

It's a complicated question. There are many types of customer. What we do know is that bitcoin has more potential customers than current customers.  What bitcoin needs to do is ensure that it is the best option (between both conventional products and other cryptocurrencies) to the potential customers, or it will eventually no longer be successful.

before that - digital gold.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:23:49
Ok, take for example something like Swift, where they are acting as the clearing house for many banks that don't trust each other. I can fathom that it may be more efficient than what they currently do where all transactions have to go through swift (and it can take days) to use a private blockchain, where banks register a public key with swift when they join. Only entities that have joined may send transactions or mine blocks. Mining could be POW or POS or whatever, it's a different scenario to bitcoin as access is already restricted so anonymous 50%ing is not a risk, and mining would not necessarily have to be resource hungry. 
This might allow banks that don't trust each other, but do trust swift (which they already have to do anyway with the current system) to make faster, cheaper peer to peer transactions than they can today. This might also be do-able with a traditional centralised db controlled by swift, but it might be easier to implement with a blockchain and involve placing less trust in swift.
The above is just brainstorming off the top of my head, and probably has some flaws, but even if I can't immediately see how a blockchain could be used in such a way, I don't rule out the possibility that someone can invent such a way.
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:43:15

No need for anyone else except banks to mine it. There could be a an agreed whitelist of entities allowed to mine blocks, each bank could sign their own mined block with their own private key. If no one except whitelisted banks can create blocks there's no need to have custom hardware.

Both, trusting the entity that runs the system and provides access to it - to a certain degree to only allow legitimate banks access for example, not trusting the other participants in the system but being able to transact in a peer-to-peer way with them regardless.

In Bitcoins case the entities are unknown and untrusted, and it's desired to be an open system that anyone can participate in. 
In the case of the banks, the entities are known, but not necessarily trusted, and it's not desired that it's open and anyone can participate. A different solution to Bitcoin may be optimal for this scenario.

I can clarify something here that can be confusing. Technically the bitcoins are always on the blockchain, but since the private keys are needed to spend the bitcoins, the private keys effectively *are* the bitcoins. So when someone says "my bitcoins are stored offline" or "my bitcoin are stored in a paper wallet" they mean the private keys. 
Additionally the private keys are all you need to store, as the corresponding public bitcoin addresses for those keys can be regenerated from private keys. 
(Also your 12 words can take the place of private keys in what I just said, as in that case the private keys are (re)generated from only the words and nothing else)

Right, so you can estimate it in monetary terms, or consider the resources you would need to construct enough miners, or even whether you could feasibly acquire them without bringing attention to yourself.

You can compare them, but only by comparing similar units. A bitcoin is about one 14 millionth of the current supply, or a 21 millionth of the total eventual supply. So to compare them you need to compare against an amount of gold that is a similar percentage of the total gold.

Ok lets start with the simplest case to use bitcoin, you need generate a keypair (one private key, and a public address is derived from it), you can try this out on  
I just did, and it created the private key (they always start with a 5) 5JQruUEJYJwC6wu36nX2z7UNLm5CHsYkwWuAsdErRwxo3dCSjfK 
The corresponding public address, which was mathematically generated from the private key is
(I believe this is a shortened simplified String of the actual public key). The public address will always start with a 1 or a 3.
In this case, you can freely share the public address 1pg6... with anyone and they can choose to send coins to it. That results in a transaction being added to the blockchain with that address as the 'output'.
In order to spend those coins you need to create a transaction which uses that address as the input and is signed with the private key. When the nodes in the network receive that transaction they can verify it and add it to the blockchain also. They know it's valid because they know the previous transaction put coins there (so it has coins to spend), and they know the owner of the private key signed it (the transaction itself proves this) so a miner will add it to the blockchain.
So, that's the simplest case, one key pair. For the reasons you mentioned you may want many key-pairs in a wallet, so that you don't re-use the same address more than once (for privacy) or you may want multiple wallets on different devices etc. 
A nice solution that emerged for this was HD wallets. With these you use 12 words (easy to backup manually without making a mistake compared to long random strings). from these words a predictable, endless stream of private keys (and of course the associated public keys from those) can be generated. 
And this can always be re-done from scratch if you ever lose the wallet for any reason. 
So it's multiple public/priv key pairs per HD wallet (12 words) but not multiple public per private as you assumed. There are more complex wallets (called multi-sig) possible where multiple private keys are created and a decided number of them are required to create transactions, like a joint bank account, but forget about this until you're familiar with the basics.

Don't worry it's common for miners not to understand the difference between mining profits and speculation profits, so even when they make a mining loss they often think they've made a profit. It's why mining is pretty pointless unless you've a huge edge - you're competing with people happy to make a loss.

Some questions worth thinking about, assuming you agree with his analysis -
What value of equities could you safely store on the blockchain given its current state?  
Is the current stock ownership system 100% secure, what lengths would you have to go to to break it, take it down, or destroy it, how much would it cost?  
Is there a hashrate of bitcoin that would make it sufficiently secure to keep equities on it, what would it take to get there?

Because it would be transparent and you'd never notice.

The answer to this is to ask him is everyone who uses gold qualified to recognise with 100% accuracy that something is gold or say it for certain that gold cannot be manufactured or trans-mutated cheaply?

The whole debate over units was a disaster. Many saying it's not a problem because unit bias doesn't exist, or implying that you're an idiot if you experience it. People saying that using amounts like 0.00001 is completely fine and you could never confuse that with 0.000001. People saying we should have loads of different units milibits, microbits, centibits, because scientific notation with 7 different units in common use is perfect for money! (µ฿) looks like a censored swear word, and is unpronounceable unless you're familiar with µ or ฿.
It's terrible when you're trying to bring a new concept like Bitcoin to someone and the units are sufficiently complex that you need to spend the entirety of the attention-span you have for a general introduction by getting sidetracked to explain the unit notation and how it differs from regular currency.
All we needed was to settle on one simple word that denoted a sufficiently small amount of bitcoin and was not confusing. The closest we got was 'bit' which only achieved half of that.

We're 7 years in to over a 100 year distribution phase, and 2/3s of coins have already been distributed. The distribution is clearly excessively front loaded. It could have been much more gradual. It could have been a constant distribution. It could have started slow, then increased in the middle and slowed again. But it was explicitly designed to be front loaded.
When the mining reward decreases it's a large sudden change, it could have been gradual every week, but instead we get a complete halving of the reward every 4 years. This is a shock to the system from a supply point of view that is likely to cause price volatility and speculation.
Satoshi obviously thought through so many aspects of bitcoin so carefully, so I have to assume he was aware of the consequences of the choices he made to front-load distribution and infrequent but large reward drops. 
If I could ask Satohsi anything, my first question would be what his thoughts and intentions were about this aspect of bitcoin. I think he wanted to create a gold rush, he achieved it, and it may have been the only way bitcoin got to critical mass.

Price rises are not mining profits, they are speculation profits. If mining does not get you more bitcoins than you paid, you're always better off buying/holding bitcoin instead. For example, spending 1 bitcoin (or the dollar value of 1 bitcoin at the time) to mine 0.9 bitcoins is always unprofitable mining, regardless of increases in price.

yes, and this happened because the adjustment in difficulty when hash rate rises only happens every two weeks, so a significant mining power increase can cause blocks to be found faster than every 10 minutes before the next two week adjustment. This has been happening most of the time.

A few people are mentioning the price and saying it's a pity that it was at $600. I disagree, I think it's actually a good thing (™). You only see it that way because you already have Bitcoin. Imagine you knew nothing about Bitcoin until you saw the show and you now think it costs about $600 a coin and you go to buy some, are you going to be more happily surprised if it's over $1000 a coin or at $250 a coin when you actually see the current price? Think about it.
In addition the show did a good job of highlighting the fact that the price is volatile, and explaining why in a non-fear-mongering way, so it shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that it's not at the same price as in the show.

I mean I've no idea of the specifics either, but when Jordan talks about it he seems legit worried about that aspect only. He explicitly says he has no prejudice against trans people, knows some, and is happy to use their preferred gender pronouns. He clearly says his only issue with it is that legally compelling him to use them is 
unreasonable and an act of compelled speech. 
I think it's reasonable to agree with what he says, it makes sense and doesn't seem radical or prejudicial in any way. So I expect if you've an issue with it you either a) think he's wrong about the law - which I can't argue with you about as I don't know the specifics of it or b) think he's lying when he says what his problem with it is and that he's not prejudiced against trans people.

I don't believe any of these edge cases for BTC matter. Bitcoin, eth and all the other alt-coin markets are dominated by speculative hodling and trading. Whatever one is the leader is probably what people are going to be smuggling, but it's not an important factor right now.
If you really believe, as some others commenting on this post are saying, that Bitcoin is at its current price primarily because of fundamental use other than speculation, then there should be no big concerns about people jumping from bitcoin to ethereum.

Here's a thought about inherent value:
Audio CDs were physical items that had a value, because they provided the utility of playing music.
Now we have a virtual replacement in digital audio files, which do not physically exist, but provide the same utility. They also provide additional utilities, free to copy, more portable, which makes them more valuable. Thus, despite their inherent value, CDs are no longer required.
Gold has a value as a metal, you can make jewellery out of it because it looks pretty and it's malleable (EDIT: also useful in industry). But it also has a value as a store of value or currency, because it has these properties: divisibility, scarcity, easily recognizable, fungible, somewhat portable.
Now Bitcoin is a virtual replacement for gold as it has all of these properties that led to gold being used as money, but it provides huge advantages on top of this. Now that we have Bitcoin, we have less need (I won't say none) for gold as a store of value/currency.
EDIT: For years recorded music could only exist in physical form, so people associated the physical form with the music, and because they were so used to it, it took time for them to be comfortable with a non-physical digital invention providing the same utility. Our children will never have this association, and will have no sentimental or habitual ties to the physical representation.
EDIT 2: Removed references to 'inherent/intrinsic" value as I agree with the replies saying all value is subjective.

It's always sad when people don't want Bitcoin to be successful. It's one thing playing devil's advocate and trying to get a balanced view, but many people I've tried to explain it to and debated with about it eventually just start grasping at any reason to deny it's utility or worth. Maybe they're scared of change, or afraid to admit they were wrong, but I feel bad for them that they don't just experience immense excitement and curiosity like I did when I started learning about it.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:38:33
And I think this is why it's good to have alt coins. For example if people were to vote with their feet in the case that some powerful miner corporations agreed on some unpopular change like increasing coincap, where would people who vote with their feet go to? back to fiat? or to another crypto?
In this scenario we can consider the protocol, and what difference there may be between it and alt coins as a fundamental that helps determine value. I never thought about this before but it's cool eh?

+hi again Matt, well done another great segment.
If you're looking for ideas for another one of the segments I'd suggest a piece on why huge price growth we've seen so far is normal for Bitcoin. I think people that are used to stocks are seeing the vertical chart and +1000% growth and thinking 'this has to be a bubble'.
Try comparing the first 5 year chart of Bitcoin to the chart of the first 6 years of Google (between 1998 and 2004). You won't be able to because Google's growth from 0 to a market cap of $23 billion was *before* IPO. Bitcoin's IPO was essentially on the day it was launched, this means typical pre-IPO growth was visible to everyone, when usually it is not.

Such progress over the 12 days, finally a segment with no mention of the volatility, the price, or speculation on future price.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:26:15
The thing to worry about is other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:28:43
It's a bit different though, as there's no need to provide your private key when making a purchase online.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:56:40
you're joking... but it may in fact happen.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:13:06
This, and the truth seems to be that nobody, including Bobby himself, have a clue which it is. But most people are assuming the worst and panic selling.
People seem to find it difficult to assess partial good or bad news in Bitcoin, everything is either TO THE MOON! or OMG PANIC! when sometimes it's just something in between.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:34:03
phew, thought everyone was gonna leave me hanging for a minute there! THAT would  have been embarrassing.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:26:19
Also, I meant to say thanks for posting this letter, it's one of the best pieces on Bitcoin I've ever read, tackling many of the common questions/arguments that people throw at it. This paragraph in particular is awesome:


@_date: 2013-12-20 14:45:03
I like to think of it as, when the node solving the block proves its work to all the other nodes, they give it permission to credit itself with 25 new bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:40:50
How many BTC could you have bought at the time for that 800? I doubt you'll ever mine that much if you're only getting 0.008 at your peak return. You may mine only about 1.2 BTC total in the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:29:12
True, edited the post to mention this too. I used jewellery as my primary example as it was valued for that historically before any of those other application existed.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:18:37
I didn't think about this too much, I guess I said it because it's a commonly used phrase when questioning the value of Bitcoin - it's the classic 'intrinsic value' question. I'm guessing it's usually used to try and separate the utility value from speculative value but you pose a good question, and I don't think I have a definitive answer for you.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:15:47
a rig that can mine twice the value of bitcoin it cost in the first year? I'm pretty sure this doesn't exist.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:31:12
name any future price of Bitcoin where a miner that costs 1.0 BTC and mines 0.9 BTc will be a good investment?
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:54:26
It's also not banned in Thailand.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:20:59
Sure, I didn't want too get too technical but just make the point that the bitcoin value is not necessarily in the 'wallet', for example what someone may refer to as a 'paper wallet' is often just a single private key.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:58:12
What people are prepared to pay will depend on what their alternatives are. How many users will choose bitcoin and $100 fee over another crypto and $1 or less fees? Which one is likely to be peoples first experimentation with crypto? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:53:27
The network effect in action, seeing someone else accepting it might be all a vendor needs to persuade them.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:37:36
What I love about this is that her final question was "is it a buy or a sell" but Matt had been so enthusiastic talking about the ecosystem and the community that the conversation had moved away from the 'investment speculation' completely.
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:12:20
I will never get used to Americans spelling cheque as 'check'
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:29:53
Thank you, you're a gent!
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:16:11
what typo?
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:57:45
This is what most of the alts are anyway :) 
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:14:41


lol, I predict a meme with Biff Tanen from BTTF, anyone got the chops to make it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:25:18
woohoo, thanks, 2 whole internets! I will try not to spend them both in one place. :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:04:36
Cryptsy must be making mad profits, they should give this dude a BTC or two for his honesty.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:18:33
Not only do I not mind the name Satoshi, I think I prefer it to Bitcoin. It's just a cool sounding word.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:12:12
Nice balanced answers, I agree with everything you say.
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:40:16
You'll already be dead
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:38:22
Is this what snap card   already does?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:51:56
What if the price in dollars for a pair of shoes will be $457392 by then?
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:12:04
Hi, firstly it's great to see someone in the media admitting they don't know much about Bitcoin, but engaging the community and willing to learn instead of dismissing it as criminal/scam/useless.
Anyway, one thing that stuck out in the original video for me is that the people you were talking to thought Bitcoin was difficult to buy/use inherently, taking days and requiring lots of identification.
As you can see from getting tips here, it's easy to send quickly and without any ID over the internet. The delays and verification requirements were all due to legacy 'snail' banking and clunky KYC/AML regulation enforced on Bitcoin exchanges. It would be nice to make this clear on air next time.
Good luck, and welcome to the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:22:50
I was ignoring it already :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:20:11
Yes, obviously. What's your point? You can argue in this way that Bitcoin is physical money so, just like gold.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:03:14
If you already own a hard disk you can purchase/copy music without purchasing anything physical. The physical object has been separated from the product.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:13:01
Ever notice we never see Matt and Billy Corgan in the same place at the same time?
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:27:42
depends how many Bitcoins $1000 would have bought at the time.. and for how many days 'per day' holds true.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:54:46
Don't mine. Buy. The loss every unprofitable miner makes is the gain of those buying the cheap coins off them.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:54:06
thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:41:19
nice one!
@_date: 2013-06-09 14:01:37
Kudos for using the correct 'couldn't care less' versus the usual 'could care less'
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:13:27
I would like to see a whole episode dedicated to this and the damn volatility thing that they keep trying to derail each segment with. Get it over with and then the remaining segments can be free of it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:05:48
To be fair that was much more balanced, objective and informative than I expected. It touts the usual intrinsic value falsity though.
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:22:43
reddit tipbot is the killer app :D
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:47:11
I think he's confused about digital resources being created out of thin air, as in the physical world this isn't how it happens.
I wonder if he's curious about where new emails come from, how they get created.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:11:11
Snail-banking as I call it, tough to go back to it after using BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:34:42
hi, thank you! you're a gent, I think you need a space before the @ maybe :) btw I'm planning on a fun way to re-distribute the tips I got on this post back to the reddit community later today, I'll let you know when I do.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:01:10
It sounds like getting more Bitcoin has become a 'game' for you. I think it's easier to value Bitcoin as a digital collectable more than fiat money, as the scarcity is more emphasised, and the value increases quite quickly. I don't see it as a problem if you enjoy the game. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:27:09
Are you going to hold them indefinitely until you die?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:14:48
drinking game, shot on all of them.... i am very drunk.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:52:54
Matt, it's been amazing watching the transformation in tone of these segments already, even after a couple of days.
No mention of illegal activities in this video, you gave a fair balanced view on the volatility issue, highlighting that in the long run Bitcoin only goes up, but most of all it's great that it's clear you have been won over by the community and recognise the movement, and you have the people on the other side of the table acting moving from skeptical to curious.
 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:23:36
One really cool aspect of the cryptography which is quite easy to understand at a high level is digital signatures. 
If you have a public bitcoin address "abc" which has a private key "xyz", you can, using cryptography 'sign' a message to a 3rd party which proves to them that you have the key for 'abc' without them knowing that the key is 'xyz'. This is kind of amazing.
Contrast this to credit cards for example, where in order to verify you are the card owner you must share all the card information (the equivalent of your private key)
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:29:17
Now that's when brain wallets will really overtake physical ones :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:10:58
stationary store website Pen Island has the same problem: penisland.net

he's also the most like-able of the presenters, based on what I've seen.

If they compromise it by funding it, it forks and becomes someone elses midnight project without the compromises.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:18:27
Good idea, here's the log scale graph of price over the last 4 years:
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:16:34
wow thank-you, no one ever tipped me before, time for me to learn how this works :) I'll be sure to pay it forward
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:28:29
As someone said "It goes to zero or it goes to many zeroes" 
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:53:00
Coins as unique entities don't exist in Bitcoin, only addresses and balances. If I mine some Bitcoin it gets created by a balance being credited to my address. If I send those Bitcoins to someone else, the record that of the transaction is kept i.e. 2 BTC from me to other person. The 2BTC in this case do not exist as separate entities, just like individual dollars in online banking may not.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:11:08
He should have said yes, just like every other currency/money can.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:36:14
In the gold industry you have people with mining equipment mining gold and literally printing money for themselves.... how is this not putting MASSIVE power in the hands of those who own gold mining companies or pickaxes? Why would people want a commodity like this?
But seriously, there needs to be a fair way to distribute new coins, a lottery with your odds based on how much 'work' you did is the best Satoshi could come up with, have you a better suggestion?
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:08:27
People fear what they don't understand
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:20:39
Congratulations, you no longer have friends, you have an entourage.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:12:55
Wow Matt is even winning over bowtie a bit - "I thought this was a joke, it's not"
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:41:33
And now it's easier than ever for their fans to reward them directly for it. They can put up a BTC address like TPB did so their fans can donate directly to them, instead of 90% of the cost of a physical artifact going to middle men.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:04:13
I would recommend watching the other videos in the Bitcoin 101 series too, they are excellent.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:03:33
continue to inflate over what time period? They weren't inflating during the summer, why did you not sell then? or are you relying on predicting the absolute top of the market?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:11:52
I thought Matt's colleagues would be all over the China news scaremongering today, but they didn't and seem more and more accepting and curious as the 12 days of Bitcoin progress. Once again, well done Matt. Nice summary of mining too. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:17:32
yes, but you forgot the pre-order part of the scam, by taking a pre-order payment you get to mine with it at it's most valuable time and then ship it just as it's becoming unprofitable. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:59:26
Isn't this why we have receipts?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:05:28
How about proposing a date and time for the changeover, notifying all exchanges, charting sites etc of the date in advance. This would give them time to prepare, and you could get some assurance that a critical mass of important bitcoin related entities were on board?
The more that get on board the easier it would be to persuade the rest.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:01:48
Q: Why did the hipster Bitcoin miner burn out his GPU.
A: He was mining before it was cool.

Reading the comments on this thread... so many people and so much wealth is going to leave America.
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:33:51
like tank-mail?
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:08:30
or a separate subreddit for speculation. This approach works well on bitcointalk forums.

I sure hope that you don't. That misuse of the apostrophe offends me.
