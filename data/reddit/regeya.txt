If you'd like to hit some less popular Youtube vids, may I suggest  ;-)

People use USD at strip joints and to hire prostitutes, you know.

Sounds like a great idea to get the word out!

Call me crazy, and by my own admission I suck at finances, but wouldn't handling Bitcoin be similar to handling bartering?  With bartering, I'm *supposed* to report the cash value of the items bartered, and pay taxes on my earnings.

It's a moderately-sized small city in the Midwest.  It has a high concentration of insurance companies on the one hand, and on the other, it's got a higher-than-average poverty rate.


Oh, I'm well aware of Winmodems; in 1996, I started using Slackware to get classwork done (yes, really.)  Winmodems were notoriously undocumented and therefore not supported under Linux, so I would end up paying a premium for modems.




I think bringing up the inflated price still works, though, because median US household income was still lower then than it is now.  The ZX Spectrum never caught on here so a "cheap" computer in the US was much higher.  Plus as you say, even by the time Windows 95 came out it was still very much an enthusiast thing.  If you just wanted to play games in 1991, you were probably more likely to drop $200 on a console.  Nowadays you can build a perfectly decent PC for the price of a console.

Yeah, average people didn't have this kind of setup.  In fact, honestly, home computers weren't all that common until much more recently.  I remember my parents bought a Zeos 386SX in 1990.  Those things ran about $2000, which puts them closer to $4000 today.  Modems weren't cheap back then, either.
I mean, yeah, in 1990 I'm sure a lot of home computers were cheaper, but if you wanted a PC it was still early adopter phase.  In 1995 only about 15% of America was on the Internet.
