This. I originally bought 1 BTC at the beginning of this year when it was ~1200 as an investment for my sons since it was still around since the last time I heard of it in 2011 so I figured it had some longevity. Did not expect it to jump over 10x in less than 9 months, nor did I expect to make enough in that time in what has essentially become my side hustle to buy a car or put a down payment on a house. Will def echo what you said about a lot of little investments before finding ones that work, as I made out like a bandit in some cases with coins skyrocketing, in others I got my butt handed to me but that was OK since it was just one of many attempts that I made for not too much capital.

Now they probably do, and it makes their acceptance of something even the SEC didn't back look positively progressive from their position

Well I remember I asked if Coinbase was a good starting point and the only response I got was "get a real wallet", with no other information given

Nice, I actually only took the risk and bought BTC after my wife became pregnant in February 2017. I thought I would have to wait years for it to show some gains, 16 months later am well down the rabbit hole. Another good read I like is "Digital Gold"

Personally, I say you did really well. You got in at the "ground level" of the action so to speak, you weren't kicking yourself for getting involved in the Mt. Gox thing, and most importantly, you used it as a currency and actually did something fun and useful with it, which is how currency is supposed to be. Yes, it's frustrating looking back on how much you could have had, but what if it had gone the other way and lost it all, how much worse would you feel now?
I bought 1 BTC at the beginning of the year when it was around 1250$USD because I had some extra cash lying around and I wanted to feel somehow 'invested' in the future, if that makes any sense. Don't think I will ever touch it short of need for an emergency, and will probably pass it onto my kids later on, and who knows what it will be like at that point? If it goes up great, then Daddy made a smart call, but if somehow it fails then it's another lesson as well, a learning experience in another way. That in turn is worth whatever I paid for it, how valuable it is will be whatever I choose it to be.
