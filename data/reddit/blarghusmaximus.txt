Bitcoin is not transparent. They're overstating how 'easily' these things can be linked. Yes, if the thief is stupid, they can be 'easily' linked. However, if youre smart enough to pull off a multimillion dollar hack -- youre smart enough to get away with it too.
There's ways to obfuscate the origin of coins.

By and large there is no security at point of sale anymore.  There's just nothing you can really do. The pens dont work, the optical scanners dont work, holsing the bill up to the light doesnt work...  
The best security practice is simply not to accept bills larger than a $20. Some places that works (subway) some it doesnt (Macys).  But essentially no one uses pens, or optical scanners anymore.  We just give the money to the bank and if the bank says hey this is fake then we lose the money, pull the video, and refuse service next time the person comes in.

Okay. Coinbase isnt an exchange.  
What this means is coinbase is low on coins, from people buying dips. But fewer people are selling on coinbase. So supply of coins on coinbase is low, price goes up.  
What does this mean? To me it means people are selling btc on exchanges, but not on coinbase.  Exchanges are temporary sells, coinbase is where long term sellers go.  
Bullish indicator.  The exchange sellers will rebuy.

The real reason the police do the "allegedly" crap is to prevent the defense attorney from claiming the jury pool has been tainted and are not capable of presuming the defendnt innocent... which just wastes everyones time --  but the defense attorney has to do it anyway even though he knows its a waste of time.

Bitcoin incentivizes savings and discourages buying frivolously, yes.  The average American has $10,000 in credit card debt, though, so maybe thats not such a bad thing.

If you own a bunch of high end mining hardware, why rent it out? 
If the rental fee is less than what the mining rig earns, the business is stupid - they could run the miner themselves and make more money than they can renting hardware. 
If the rental fee is greater than the profit from mining, id be an idiot to rent it as a customer.  
Ergo, either the company is run by an utter moron, or anyone who uses the company's services is getting ripped off.

No, its a legit concern, and its good youre thinking about it.  Youre right, if you pay someone bitcoin amd they dont send the stuff - - youre screwed.  
Whixh is why the bitcoin *community* is important.  
When im looking to buy something, I go to other bitcoiners and get references from people. Its much more like small town...  So when I go buy my shave soap, I wont get screwed.  If the guy screwed me out of $10 worth of soap, id tell the community, and the shop would lose all its customers.

From 
**TL;DR:** There are so many addresses that it is improbable that anyone will ever generate a duplicate of another address in use – as long as random number generators work as they should.
2^160 possible addresses
Bitcoin addresses consist of an alphanumerical string with a length of up to 34 characters, excluding the capital "O", the capital "I" and the lowercase "l", as well as the number "0". This would allow for 58^34 possible combinations, however, as some of the positions are used for a checksum this is reduced to 2^160 valid addresses. The checksum on the other hand allows to detect mistyped addresses as invalid, so that it is highly unlikely to accidentally input another valid address.
Chance of 3.42*10^(-27) for a collision at one trillion addresses
Even if we generously assume that at some point there will be one trillion addresses (approx. 160 for each of this planet's population), according to the simple approximation formula for the Birthday attack given on Wikipedia, the chance is 3.42*10^(-27) that any two of those Bitcoin addresses collide. In comparison, the figure of addresses that were ever used to receive bitcoins was just over 13 million in May 2013.

I did a mobile deposit (check).  A MONTH later they pulled it back, saying the check was unreadable (aka, they fronted me the money LONG before they ever looked at the check). That overdrafted my account.  Several thousand bucks overdraft. I then had to redeposit the check, but I had to eat the fees!

What if we could increase net profit by 2%? Thats the theme.
Overstock did 500,000 in sales and saved 2% in tx fees on them - thats $10,000 in pure cash savings.  
Most of those businesses will be adding several zeroes to that. A small shop will do 5 million in sales. 2% is 100,000 bucks. Thats another two managers in the buulding.  Thats an increase in customer service. That itself increases sales even further.

I can preorder games at gamestop for cash. I give them cash, they give me a receipt. I can then walk into another gamestop, give them my receipt, and walk out with cash. Thats a deposit and withdrawal. Is gamestop acting like a bank?
What about pokerstars, are they a bank? I deposit, I withdraw.. and that seems to be your entire definition.  
No, banks loan money or secure money. Thats what banks do.  They have vaults and safety deposit boxes, and they make loans.  Gox didnt do any of that.  It was not a bank. Its more like pokerstars.

Exactly. Just because you can deposit something of value there and then take it back out later doesnt make it a bank *per se*. Banks make loans, thats where their profit comes from. 
Its like the guy on here a few days ago, who posted about preordering video games at gamestop (aka deposit cash) then withdraw cash at another gamestop by cancelling the preorder and getting a full refund. That doesnt make gamestop a bank.

Until merchants give a discount for BTC, no one will spend them. 
Look, I gotta convert fiat to BTC to spend it. Coinbase takes 1% off the top. 
So you gotta give me 1% off or I'm losing money over paying you fiat. And fiat *itself* is losing 3% a year to inflation. So now we're at 4%. 
If the BTC store your shopping out isnt giving you at least 5% savings over paying in fiat *youre getting ripped off*.

I assume theyre trying to prevent people from using them as a trading hedge. For example if you think BTC is going to drop against USD, deposit BTC with Bovada and wait for the drop, and then withdraw. You'll receive more BTC back than you put in.
I dont know why they'd give a shit though, it changes nothing for them. They say its "processing fees" ... when I offered to give them $1.00 to MORE than pay for the transaction... they didnt like that.
@_date: 2019-02-21 19:52:27
No, no bonus on this one.  I just got another email saying 
"For example: if you deposited $100 you would need to risk the full $100 in order to withdraw your funds. Therefore, weather [sic] its 10 buyins of $100 or 1 buy in for $100 the full deposited amount would need to be wagered to not get penalized with a fee."
My reading of this is you deposit 10 buyins for 100nl, you need to pay $1,000 worth of rake (or lose 10 buyins) in order to not get penalized at cashout.

True, and probably important for an internet slots player who wants to piss away 20 bucks ... but they are likely below 1% of internet gamblers. Its sports and poker. And neither of those things really require in/out instant cashouts -- they tend to leave large amounts of money online for extended periods of time -- not in/out.&gt;Because some people can't bet with dollars and you can't send and receive dollars across the world in seconds (or an hour). 
If bitcoin existed years ago when I was playing for a living, I would have avoided it and recommended against it. 
The major gaming sites dont want to use bitcoin either -- the money they hold for players totals millions and millions, and theyre investing that money in ultra low risk (and low return) funds, but theyre investing millions, so that money adds up. They dont want to disencentivize that. 
Yeah, on the surface bitcoin seems great for internet gaming, but thats dunning-freddy-kruger --- the more you know about the topic the less sense bitcoin actually makes sense. 
Again with the stipulation that if you want to play a few hands of blackjack or Craps or roulette, yeah itll work great. But most people -- certainly most bitcoiners -- arent into that type of gambling. Its sports and poker. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:50:48
They lock in your deposit rate and use it as a cashout rate? I dont believe that, because then theyre on the hook every time the value drops. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:55:19






Those bitcoiner people are generally smart enough not to piss their money away on internet roulette. Theres also not many of them. Youre in an echo chamber, remember. 


Thats not todays internet gambler. Its not slots and Craps and roulette. Its sports and poker. These people leave money in their account for an extended period of time. Theyre not interested in doing quick in/outs -- theyre building a bankroll over time. 


Then theyd just buy bitcoin and HODL. Why gamble and risk losing a fast appreciating asset?

If bitcoin skyrockets like we all think it will ... the truth is a $100 investment will do you just fine. A 1,000 investment better still, but at the levels were imagining ... its kinda irrelevant.

Casual players just arent jumping through the hoops necessary to do it, and if they *were* inclined to do so, theyd get a vpn and play on pokerstars with the rest of europe. The games are better there.

Your first point used to be correct, but is no longer. The unlawful internet gaming enforcement ban prohibts the making of wagers online. In the definition section, "wager" specifically **excludes** any money spent on a fantasy sports game of chance.

Not to mention theres always a fee *each way*. 
Great post. 
As you clearly understand, it is not uncommon for gamblers to be making bets that have maybe a 3% edge. That edge is erased entirely if the market swings 4% during the bets duration. 
So the *true* bet is somewhere between -1% and 7% equity, and thats uncertainty, and a pro gamblers entire motto is *minimize uncertainty*.

The more i think about it the less correct I think I am.
If you buy once per month for 12 months, you will *not* at the end of the year have paid the same 'average' price as if you bought every day for 365 days. 
Its definitely true that it should average out and they should be damn similar, but the more frequent purchase will be closer to true average, while the monthly prices could be wildly inmacurate. 
So you should really, if you want to perfectly dollar cost average, buy a little bit every millisecond.  
Ok now im back to thinking in real life it probably doeant matter. Would be interested in seeing what would have happened if you bought every day at 1pm vs if you bought only on the first of the month at 1pm.

@_date: 2015-02-15 23:48:50
I work in a multi million dollar retail store, and on a given day 2% of our sales are done in cash. Sales are roughly 30k a day. So call it 500-700 bucks a day in incoming cash. 
We only switcbed to using armored trucks 2 or 3 years ago. Before, someone put the cash in a purse and the manager just drove to the bank.
Then one got robbed.  So...

25 bucks? Im down for a billboard selfie! Where do I sign up
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:10:06
The interval of time doesnt matter, it just increases variance. 
Average price is priceChange/time 
So if we buy every day for 7 days, we will have bought at the average price for that week. 
If we buy every month for a year, we will have bought at the average yearly price. 
Now, if we buy every day for 365 days, we get the same average price as if we bought every month for a year. Because a month is just a collection of days. And a year is a collection of months. 
Tldr: the more frequent your purchase rate the more accurate your price will be to 'true average'. But on a long enough time scale the difference becomes meaningless.

Those essentially cost nothing. A retail stores locations *rent* is 10k a month. Running these around is so comparitively cheap to a businesses operating costs its not worth the risk.

Hi, Loss Prevention Specialist here.   
You'd be surprised how bad minor theft can hurt a business.   
Lets look at a case of beer, its got about a 10% profit margin. That means for every case of beer that is stolen, you have to sell \*\*10 more cases\*\* just to break even.   
You dont make a single bit of profit until you sell that 11th case, at which point you make 10% of the sales price in profit margin. For a $15 case of beer ... youve now sold 11 cases of beer .. and made $1.50 profit.  
Its estimated that 1/3rd of small businesses fail solely because of theft. (Usually thats an employee in a small business).   
The higher the profit margin, the less this hurts the business, and a glass of lemonade is like hugely profitable, but the concept remains. It adds up \*big\*

I did this for a living for roughly 5 years, I've never even heard of a live playing being given a 100% buyin for a 50% stake. Your ROI isn't even close to that, especially since you didn't post A) who you are B) your stats: expected ROI, recent wins, etc. 
This is a terrible deal, redditors. Do not take. He is free-rolling off you. (And didn't even establish his re-payment history of staking in the past!) If you want to get in on some WSOP poker horses, head over to twoplustwo's staking forum. 
That said, poker really is awesome for BTC. But this guy? fuck no. 
Signed, 
Ex-Moderator of giant poker site, who quit playing on Black Friday
Double edit: Max Steinberg (who posts his entire staking history, commentates for ESPN, and is a seriously badass motherfucking beast at the tables, gives straight percentage. You pay 10% you get 10% of profit. Period. Anyone doing otherwise is **fucking horseshit**.) Real poker players also will not sell 100% of their action -- if they win, they'd get nothing! This guy is making you pay 100% while keeping 50% for himself. Do not touch.)
Triple Edit: Here  is Danny Steinberg (Max's brother, the twins are sick) selling action on his $10,000 buyin. What are the payouts? 










And Danny is a HUGE, HUGELY +EV player in this game. And he's only charging a 25% markup. Fuck you dude. You should be ashamed.
Fourth Edit:
You'll also note, that on the twoplustwo thread Danny is getting shit for **charging too much** ... at 25%!

First note bitcoin wasnt designed for brick and mortar retailers, it was meant for internet retailers. 
The biggest problem with crossing the 'real life' gap is the lack of a turn-key POS interface which insulates the retailer from the exchange rate problems, prints receipts, handles returns, etc. No one has made one yet, itll happen. 
Best Buy/Walmart could accept bitcoin for site to store purchases and it would work fine though.

6,000 per second vs 4,000 per TEN MINUTES.
Not going to happen, yo. 
Bitcoin is great for 'shop online, pick up at store' but its just not going to work in a high-volume retail store. 
How are you going to drive through mcdonalds and pay with bitcoin? Theyre going to want 1 confirmation (or youll just double spend that shit next door at burger king) and thats 10 minutes average. HARD RULE.

Your very link discredits you, in the very next sentence: A bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places. Therefore, 0.00000001 BTC is the smallest amount that can be handled in a transaction. If necessary, the protocol and related software can be modified to handle even smaller amounts.
In other words, right now a coin can "only" go to 8 decimals. But it would be relatively trivial to make it go more.

Again im probably an idiot, but I work in loss prevention and I see scumbags try and exploit the system every day. Right now im hunting down a group of girls using fake checks to buy thousands of dollars of merchandise from us.

The verification will not speed up as the hashrate grows. The verification will slow as more transactions try and get verified. This is why people hate SatoshiDice -- every bet is its own transaction -- and people say this is 'gumming up the works'
But Whole Foods would do more transactions in a day than SatoshiDice ever will. 
Bitcoin is in REAL trouble scalability wise. People think its going to replace visa/mastercard ... not in its current form. Visa does 8,000 transactions PER SECOND. Bitcoin maxes out at 4,000 PER TEN MINUTES
This is a REAL problem.

All of those arguments are just... dumb and shortsighted. None of the issues listed are 'glaring' or 'compelling' in the least. The guys just not thinking very hard.
 Yes, writing  a contract in bitcoin RIGHT NOW (without tying it to the USD equivalent) would be stupid because bitcoin is growing so fast. But that's not going to happen forever. Bitcoin will stabilize, making contracts perfectly workable. 
The second argument is just stupid. The value of bitcoin is not reliant on whether you think its technically a currency or not. You can call it a marshmallow for all I care. I dont know why this is a 'glaring issue' whatsoever. And if the exchanges were to disappear (which is an absurd proposition) Bitcoin will not be useless. New exchanges will open. Even if they don't bitcoin won't be useless. Exchanges are not required in the least.
Again, the current price is volatile because its new and growing. Eventually it will be old and stable.
And third 'morality note' argument. Bitcoin is illiquid RIGHT NOW. Not forever. It is volatile RIGHT NOW. Not forever. And the USD has no asset backing whatsoever, so why is bitcoin bad for not having asset backing? The USD doesnt. The Euro doesnt.

Homeless people arent storing bitcoin long term, so volatility is irrelevant to them. They use it as soon as they get it. 
Many homeless have no ID and no way to get a bank account. Hell, this is true for the poor all over the world. BTC gives them a bank accoynt innately. 
Lack of electricity and internet is not a problem. They get donated old flip phones, or the $9.99 7/11 phones, and sit outside starbucks. Most retail stored have free wifi.

NPR talked about this the other day
What makes money is time IN the market, not timING the market. 
Daytrading is fun and exciting and makes your dopamine levels skyrocket. Its physically addicting. But 95% of traders lose money doing it. There is no evidence that anyone has ever been able to predict tops and bottoms of a stock with reliability. With so many people trading, a few will get it right through pure dumb luck and get rich, but they won the stock lotto - they werent brilliant.  
Most day traders lose money.  All of it.  
The warren buffetts of the world dont day trade and never have.  They look for a company they think has strong future value and they buy that stock. Then they sell when the think the stock has reached its correct value.  
If youre truly a daytrader and cant get enough of it, put 80% of your investment in cold storage and day trade the other 20. Prepare to lose it.

@_date: 2013-11-07 16:05:32
Exactly.  In poker, and in stocks, and likely in bitcoin or any other zero sum competitive binary market, on a given day 55% of people will lose money to 45% of the winners. Longer term, 95% of people will be net losers of money to 5% of winners.
Unless youre certain youre one of the top 5%, day trading is no more than blackjack. You may get lucky here or there, but youre going to lose. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:25:25
No, youre incorrect. Visa eats the loss if the card was present during the transaction (so if the card got stolen or copied). The merchant eats the loss if the card is NOT present (internet, phone orders).

The limitations were relaxed when they got a $5mil investment. 
Coinbase buys and sells coins on gox from regular people, and then sells them to regular people. They dont have an unlimited supply of coins, they try and balance supply and demand so that an equal number of people are buying from them as well as selling TO them. In bubble run ups, that can be difficult as everyone buys and fewer people sell.

Thats not really fair. The 'average' profit margin for a company is anywhere from 10-50%. Very few companies can survive at a 2% profit margin.

Whats the difference between a bitcoin tip and a bitcoin transfer? 
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:13:09
... not really accurate. 
Most players use Seals With Clubs because its the only game in town. I dont know of another BTC site open to US players.
I'm a HUGE fan of SwC so dont take any of this as a negative -- I'm playing right now!
They do have low stakes, but they really really do not have tons of players. Highest I've ever seen is 300 people at a time, and thats spread out between tournaments, cash games, and different levels. 
This is solely because the online poker world HAS NOT caught on to bitcoin. There are several reasons for this -- The biggest companies like PokerStars and Party Poker are not going to use Bitcoin because they want to go full legal USD, which looks like it may actually happen. They dont want to piss any regulators off, so they wont touch BTC. 
Second, SwC isn't doing a good job getting the word out about themselves. I played online poker for a living for YEARS, and when talking to my old poker pals, none of them have heard of it. Literally none. I only learned about it on - and I am their PERFECT target customer. Never woulda heard of em unless I was ALREADY into bitcoin. 
Third: Bitcoin has that damned 3-5 day wait to get running. Look, shitty players who rebuy OVER and OVER and OVER are the reason online poker worked. And that just cant be done on bitcoin yet. So the bad players throw a few BTC on, bust out and go broke the first day, and can't easily reload to try their luck again. **edit**: This is kind of a minor point because its competitor (Carbon Poker) accepts Americans for USD using prepaid (international) Visa Cards you can get at walmart. That takes a *little* work, and they have a *few* Americans. However, the european fish don't have the same deposit issues which gives the American sharks an incentive to jump through the hoop  **/edit**
  
  
  
**TLDR SwC COULD be great, the only thing hurting them right now is that they have no players. Their software is pretty good, they have an Android app which is a HUGE first in online poker, but they're not doing a good job getting the word out that AMERICANS CAN PLAY POKER WITH BITCOIN.**

Yes, yes, I get what youre saying, but thats not what were talking about here. I know bitcoin prevents chargebacks, and merchants are liable for chargebacks.  
Were talking about double spends, which is not a chargeback - - its a fault of merchants accepting 0 confirmation payments, similar to using a stolen credit card. The merchant has no way of knowing someone is double spending, AND the double spend catastrophically destroys the entire bitcoin economy by forking the chain.

While gyft is cool and all, unless they offer a discount on the cards, I dont see any readon to use btc over fiat. The benefits in btc all go to the merchant, not the user.  (except for silk road where its mutually beneficial). 
Merchants need to start offering me a 5% discount before i spend btc. And theyre not. And thats bad.

You cant reach stability without volatility first.  Get over it. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:22:30
 is the way this will have to go.
Ugly truth that non-nerd bitcoiners need to understand: Bitcoin can't handle a huge number of transactions at once. It just can't. Visa does 6,000 transactions per second average. 
Bitcoin won't allow blocks over 1MB, so assuming a (rather small) average transaction size of 216 bytes, Bitcoin can only handle 4,629 transactions per 10 minutes.
4,000 per TEN MINUTES vs 6,000 PER SECOND.
Bitcoin is not going to work in a brick and mortar setting. Just not. The volume is too high. The confirmations are too slow even at single confirmation (10 minutes average). How are you going to go through the McDonalds drive through, and wait 10 minutes for a payment confirmation? No way.
But thats okay. Bitcoin is an internet currency, and it will stay on the internet. It will *cross over* just like you said. Walmart could do it today if they wanted -- they already do **'shop online pick up at the store'. Thats the future of bitcoin.**

So about 3k worth -- and youre likely one of the bigger owners (I'm purely guessing, but I own 7 btc. I would bet most people are in the 0-50 range) Stock/Forex/whatever investment brokers  won't even take your phone call unless you've got $5,000+ to invest... so yeah I think there's just not enough big money involved to move the price much to the downside. 
The upside of that is once the big money does start to take notice, we'll see a huge price jump. 
I bought at 29.6 once I was pretty sure that it wasnt going to drop. I think if it holds at 30 and then breaks, it runs...

Eventually bitcoin will stop growing this fast. When all the people who want them have them, the exhange rate will become more steady.

Youre just being obstinate now. 




Thats correct. 




This would take me a long time to answer fully, but in short we have no system designed at POS to account for btc payments. The register software would need to be redesigned - - we cant take pesos either. 




It requires 20 minutes times literally 10,000 people, times an average wage of $10/hr. You can do the math. 


Were talking about online retailers, and youre comparing them to a brick and mortar store as if they have equivalent expenses and needs. They dont.

Sealswithclubs.eu (down at the moment... Some prick is ddos'ng them..) 
The site uses 'chips' to play, where 1btc equals 1000 chips.  
So if you were playing 5/10 on sealswithclubs youd buyin with 1000 chips max (aka 1btc) which would be about 75nl converted to usd
You can play as low as 1/2 (200 chip max buyin, aka 1/5th of a btc or roughly $15nl)

Yes, but that doesnt make it less of a foolish idea. Certainly if the bitcoin community agreed to pay $100 more than an item costs if they accept btc, merchants would accept btc. But itd be idiotic to do that.  
Further, merchants that accept bitcoin *do* make more money for bitcoin transactions - - they save massive fees, no risk of fraud, etc. Saving money on expenses is equivalent to making it in profit. Penny saved, penny earned. 


I dont. A btc discount is *mutually beneficial* to both merchant and customer. Both save money over dealing in fiat.

You can google it. Its about 30% military, 30% welfare (food stamps, medicaid) and 30% everything else. Keep in mind police, fire, water, most of education etc (ya know, shit that actually matters) are paid via STATE taxes, not federal.

Zero. Thats completely backward thinking. I would never pay more in btc if i could pay less in fiat.

How did you buy? With coinbase out of coins perpetually, and mtgox with a queue of 15,000 I cant find a way in.

Confirmation confuses me as well. If only I can see my wallet balance... How does the blockchain know how many I have? 
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:28:11
try replying directly to him. I tried an hour or so to get in to mine, and got in. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:07:35
That makes no sense. If mrgox requires verification to sell, the people in the queue cant have already sold. They could be planning on selling, though. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:15:37
Yeah, this is going to encourage a few people to take profit and get out. But the upward streak will resume I think. NO ONE is short on bitcoin right now.

Thanks, ill spread it wisely.

The ten minute trans confirmation time is a big reason. Accounting is another. Training cost is a third. Theres lots of barriers before were there, but one day... 


You again ignore fraud. Most companies 'shrink' is 2-3% of all sales. Not of trans fees, of sales.

The fallacy is believing deflation will occur forever. Right now the market is very thin.  There are not many participants - -  its brand new.  
Eventually the market will thicken, and the price will stabilize.

People kept sending it money :p

Tell them they cant spend it just yet. But they cant lose it. Put it somewhere safe and it may pay for someones college one day.

Yes thats all true, but its not enough of an economy to push btc into mainstteam adoption
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:35:28
I think were still 2 to 5 years from btc becoming an everyday thing. Youre in the bitcoin echochamber - - very very very few people in the world have heard of btc and even fewer understand why they should hold it.

Ill be pre-ordering COD Ghost, IDK if you can trade for preorders?
Edit: Deal completed! I paid in BTC (and got a pretty solid discount) and he traded the pre-order over immediately. Awesome. This dude got me a preorder for COD:Ghost for ~$15 usd off, paid in BTC. LEGIT.

it provides some stability, and stability is good. the silk road will not abandon bitcoin in any forseeable future imo.

Ok fine, using your numbers btc only saves 33% of trans fees instead of 330%. "only".

Only if you have a visa card, which I do not.
