Take a look at [Shamir's Secret Sharing](  You can store a secret key among n parties, any k of which can act together to recover the key.
For example, you could hide the secret among 5 people, any 3 of which could decrypt the key.  That way, if you and any 2 of the people were killed in some kind of accident, the remaining 3 could recover the funds.  Likewise, anyone attempting to betray would need to convince two others to join them to steal the funds.

I'm only half-serious.  Obviously playing silly games with the plot scale doesn't change the numbers.
However, I think people make far too much noise about the relative valuations of currencies.

Yes, you *now* have to pay 25% more for it.  So just wait - there's no hurry.  USD and BTC will still be here tomorrow.  The conversion rate will change again, and sooner or later it will move to a number you deem fair, or your definition of fair will change.  Then you can resume conversion.
If a merchant charges too many BTC for their product, don't use them.

There are 256 difficulty levels, or 257, if you include 'no requirements at all' as a difficulty level.
Finding a hash input where the first 16 bits of the digest are 0000000000000000 (0x0000) it is exactly the same difficulty as finding a hash input where the first 16 bits of the digest are 1011100111111010 (0xB9FA).  The probability is exactly 1/2^16 in either case, assuming the hash function is a random oracle.
The same goes for all digests where the first 17 bits are specified.  The same goes for all digests where the first 18 bits are specified.  Continue this up to 256 specified bits.
There are 256 levels of difficulty, because a bit cannot be subdivided.  You can specify that a byte is allowed to be 0, 1, or 2 (but not 3 through F), but a bit is either 0 or 1, and is therefore either fully specified, or fully unspecified.

What I'm saying is that the rapid fluctuations in the conversion rate between $ and bitcoin are irrelevant to someone whose goal is to gradually convert their $ into bitcoin.  They will just buy a small amount of bitcoin whenever the conversion rate reaches a value they deem fair.
To someone whose goal is exchanging currencies back and forth to get more $, the fluctuations in exchange rate are of paramount importance.  I just don't care about those people, or their problems.  They see the trees, rather than the forest.

Make it a random string.  If you include upper and lower case, numbers, and that list of symbols, then you have a 93-character alphabet.  If you use 10 random characters in your password, there are 93^10 = 48,398,230,717,929,318,249 possibilities, which is about 65 bits of security.

If we had such a (publicly known) algorithm, we could ask Bruce Schneier to generate a curve from the entropy source of his choice (maybe he types simple variants of his name into Skein or whatever).  Then the community, having decided that Schneier isn't a malicious entity, could collective decide to use that curve after verifying that the open-source algorithm was executed properly.
Would you consider that a trustworthy process?  :D
@_date: 2013-08-13 01:34:06
With 256 bits in the hash function's output (the message digest), you have about 256 levels of difficulty, spanning about 77 orders of magnitude.  There is plenty of room to grow the difficulty.
Also, as long as the hash function behaves like a random oracle (an assumption), there will always exist input, the hash of which has the required number of leading zeroes, even if the requirement is 256 zeroes!
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:49:37
Hmm...the low output rate will make testing for biases tricky.  The Diehard tests are mostly simple Monte Carlo experiments in combinatorics or geometry, with known analytical solutions.  They are quite hungry for data, though.
Have you considered a transistor with base-emitter junction that's reverse-biased?  It is a good source of true quantum mechanical white noise, which could be converted into a RNG with a decent output rate.

Why is it so difficult to generate good elliptic curves?
In the absence of a security proof, it seems like it would be sufficient to have an algorithm which generates random curves from the entropy source of your choice (radioactive decay or whatever), then evaluates them by some fitness criteria.
I find it strange there isn't such an algorithm.

'Trillions and trillions' doesn't necessarily imply multiplication the way 'trillions of trillions' would.  It could imply addition.  In that case, it might only be on the order of

Anything which computes SHA256 hashes could certainly be used to try to crack a password hashed with that same algorithm.
The problem is that they would be no more efficient than any other brute force search method.  If you tried to reverse the hash of a 128-bit random password (to recover that password), it would require on average 2^127 attempts.
By requiring only a certain number of leading zeroes, Bitcoin makes the reverse-hash vastly easier.  Half of all hashes have a leading zero.  One fourth of them have two leading zeroes.  One eighth of them have three leading zeroes, etc.
