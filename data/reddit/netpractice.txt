I don't. Wish me luck.

That actually makes fresh fries for $133 seem reasonable.

Lol, I just noticed "Amazon" in your question, I don't know why it would matter for Amazon cards. I wrote this general review so I'm posting it.
eGifter allows purchases of amounts down to the penny for most cards, this is primarily useful for restaurant bills at places I might not come back to for a long time.
eGifter has never required a wait for confirmations. Gyft sometimes has and there is no way to know if it will or not making Gyft unreliable in the store.
eGifter's points work just like they should. Gift gives me a paragraph long error message that boils down to "You can't use your points unless you give/verify info" about 95% of the time that I try to use them. 
Gyft is often able to update your balance inside the app, eGifter (almost) never can. When Gyft cannot auto-update it allows you to manually log the purchase, eGifter does not.
Gyft sorts cards much better. You can swipe over to the next one making paying with multiple cards less painful. eGifter will not let you delete cards via the app so I have to do clean up duty on the website periodically.
Gyft will work without internet access if you've already purchased a card, eGifter will not. If this might be an issue I take a screenshot of the eGifter card(s). 
Their store selections are similar but not identical. eGifter does not have Target in the app.
Both apps have crashed on me, but sometimes Gyt gets into a state where it won't open until I reinstall it. I think that has happened 3 times. For perspective I've been using Gift for at least 2 years and eGifter for about 1 year. 
Egifter is a little bit slower to open and load cards. This wouldn't be much of a problem except that if you go to another app or browser and use the icon to return to eGifter it must completely reload and you lose whatever you were about to do, including any invoice that was showing. So if you find that you went to pay an invoice with a wallet that turns out to be empty use the back button to return to the invoice.
Recently I use Gyft for Target and eGifter for everything else. Gyft's sketchy points error and possibility of confirmation waits make eGifter's inferior app worth it.  
If you don't know, GameStop cards can be used in GameStop stores to buy Shell cards with no fees. The cards swipe at the pump, no problem.
I use foldapp for starbucks. 20% discount, refunds, super fast.

He stopped talking to everyone and handed the project to Gavin, so pretty much the opposite of your implication.

That's just way too many times to measure. USA forever.

I'm from the past, safe to say, it used to be higher.

There must be multiple histories!

A lot of people thought coins were worth over $1000. Maybe they were tricked, but nevertheless, for a time many people holding bitcoins declined to sell them for $1000+. There were lots of places to spend and sell at that rate, not just MtGox.

He gave Gavin the SourceForge project and the alert key. I think that's all he had to give, so it's pretty clear what he thought of Gavin.

This isn't a big problem because you can just send from Copay or Sentinel, correct?

There is a way that anyone can make a near duplicate of any bitcoin transaction. This is called transaction malleability.
It isn't a fundamental problem because the duplicate has to have the same inputs and outputs. But it can cause confusion. That's probably all that happened.
Electrum might just need restarted, or try upgrading, or try a different server. Blockchain.info you can just ignore.

Some miners might stop, especially those with high marginal costs.
We've only got one data point on this. At the first halving difficulty was about 3440000, two periods later it was down to 2980000, now it is 63200000000.
It's hard for equipment to be more specialized than "can only mine bitcoin", but it will probably continue to get more efficient.

Just a random thought, try making a few more 'accounts' in the Mycelium wallet.
It's the "key with +" icon when you are on the accounts tab in case you don't know, if you click an account it disappears though so switch to accounts and look for it right away.

localbitcoins shows how recently a user was logged on, what does it say for them?
You can't go by the action on the address because it literally belongs to localbitcoins and not the user. All the user has is an entry in localbitcoins regular old database. He doesn't control that deposit address.

They can be blamed in the sense that if you notice a shopkeeper has a gun to his head every time you visit his store you might find somewhere else to do your shopping.

Well that's a little less good, but still not so meaningful unless she explicitly told you that it was a wallet in her own control (why would she?) and not a hosted wallet like Coinbase or an exchange.
And even if it is her own wallet it is totally possible to not notice the extra amount until she reads your message if she has a busy wallet.

If it's a localbitcoins address it means nothing that it moved. They have no idea you sent more than you meant to and them moving it is just routine. When the recipient learns of your mistake he'll make his decision and I like your odds for an amount this small. A random  person doesn't turn in to a thief for 100 bucks.
