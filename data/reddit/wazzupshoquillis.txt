apparently someone was saying that these cars would’ve been cheaper if bought new, but they’re super hard to come by straight from the factory because of the low production rate. When you buy from a third-party there’s always a severe price hike because of how hard it is to buy brand new

probably a lot of everything, and even if I’m wrong about Wall Street, there is a ‘dump’ coming, I can feel it.

just looked through r/bitcoin, haven’t been on in a bit. apparently someone found that just this morning... i was too late ㅠㅠ
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:26
what? That’s exactly his point. Don’t do that because it’s ridiculous, of course you would be *devastated.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:53:07
recently? i’d day it doubled recently, not quadrupled. but I guess that depends on your definition of recent
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:23
sounds like it’s only affecting Europeans. Americans are fine
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:53
I never said when, keep the speculation going.
also, the world population will peak when we run out of arable land, and the sun is going to explode. I can feel it
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:37
people hate when you say stuff like that, but same. actually i think itll dip more than that
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:13
dude. do you know the answer to his question? it might’ve been confusing, but it’s not even really an analogy, it was just a simple, simple explanation about currency exchange. If you want to pay an American retailer, or in his case an American school for a student loan, and you have euros, How do you do it? you have to change your euros to dollars, which you do on an exchange. Bitcoin isn’t a stock, it’s a currency. You go to the right exchange, and you can trade your bitcoin for whatever currency you need. Simple man. people keep taking a bit coin add some stock they can invest in, but it’s supposed to be a currency. In which case you should look at it like any other currency

no joking in this thread, huh? lighten up bro
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:08:34
they didn’t ask about crypto mining in general
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:37:04
its not gonna be me, but just having been a part of the community to do it would be pretty freakin awesome
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:15:30
that’s why i usually let people know to buy when i sell, cuz it always rockets up right after i sell. it’s like i have it down to a science
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:20
i’d probably be down to follow through on a promise like that except I’d be nervous I would enjoy it too much on camera and then the world would see
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:18:07
i follow both the BTC and bitcoin subs, and they’re always talking about how r/bitcoin seems to hate them so much for no reason, but for a sub named btc, they spend an awful lot of time talking about every other currency and how bitcoin isnt all its cracked up to be
edit: I wanted to add to this comment though, because I wanted to be completely transparent with my own feelings about the communities. This sub is not exactly picture perfect either, they’re notorious for deleting certain types of posts, and seem to have a problem with anyone who wants to criticize bitcoin. bitcoin isn’t perfect, nothing is for that matter. And without criticism there’s no growth. This sub definitely has its own issues as well, there’s a reason there’s two subs.

just hit 18.2k on coinbase you were saying?

i fuckin hate reddit, but i cant leave. 
thanks for the stupid laugh, I needed it tonight
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:26
yeah dude, everybody knows what a satoshi is. Still a finite amount, and like I said, there are ton of people who are holding multiple, and don’t plan to sell
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:29:51


-Wikipedia 
not actually ‘Wall Street’, but just big wigs, possibly corporations, that are pumping into this noticing how much people are interested in it, and when futures start after the weekend, they can bet against bitcoin while dumping major quantities

posted in a bitcoin subreddit
did i miss some context? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:22
and there can’t be just one of those. people should be prepared for a few more of those transactions to rock the bitcoin world for a bit
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:53
definitely a major issue. There was also a video of a guy trying to buy a cup of coffee with bit coin, and showed how we had to wait around for like 15-30 min or something for the transaction to go through, because they wanted it confirmed before he left with his coffee. It’s some hurdles that need to be overcome for sure, and in some ways it seems like the bitcoin community doesn’t care about bitcoin as a currency, they just want it to rise and rise, even though stability is a huge factor in making this a commodity that can be exchanged for goods. and it’ll be interesting to see how it plays out, for sure
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:28
The way he asked ‘why are you bringing euros into it’ was just too good, I couldn’t decide if it was an honest question or a joke. It was more like a ‘wow, there really are this many people who don’t understand that bitcoin is a currency.’ Otherwise that would’ve made perfect sense
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:11
just hit 18k
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:51:48
90% of the people you know never will, since there aren’t very many to start with, and most of them are owned by people who want to hold on to them forever
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:37:37
don’t. it’s not worth it
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:13:55
bitcoin = blockchain tech 
and can’t fail
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:45:22
this one just got WAY more mainstream than any other bubble we’ve experienced. with so many people in this round just hoping for a payout, they will without a doubt get to a point where their greed is surpassed by fear of loss, and a ton of people will pull out to collect profit. then the dip comes
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:07:34
the calm before the storm

are you not American? Or just super pedantic? because I feel like I’ve known this for a long time
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:13
coinbase has insane fees for one, and i’ve heard other complaints. but it’s super simple to use, and for the most part it’s safe. just don’t leave coins on an exchange. They always say you should move them to a Wallet ASAP
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:28
it’s definitely going to be hard for you to watch, but I honestly think there will be a correction within the week. Don’t hate me if I’m wrong, just my opinion. But while everyone’s right when they say it’s never too late, this might not be the right time during a crazy climb like this
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:32:38
first the pump, then the dump
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:22:30
obviously it would be an awesome way you gain a 30-50% increase, maybe more, in your btc holdings. but super risky, and most people would discourage any attempts to do so. i *do* believe a dip is inevitable. but would never venture to guess at exactly what point that might happen. it’s a guessing game, and those moves come with high risk.
that said, ya, you could definitely profit from these times when people/companies are pumping/dumping, but it’s more luck than anything. gambling isn’t really encouraged here, even when it comes to just buying and hodling bitcoin in general. ‘never put in what you aren’t willing to lose’
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:18:47
oh definitely. it’s why i follow both subs, as well as a bunch of altcoin subs. just gotta ignore the people who feel the need to shit on everybody else.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:47
freaking insane. I saw it for sec, but Coinbase is showing mid 16’s right now with slight fluctuation. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:17:42
but usually if you’re a journalist, you’re not also a financial advisor with a degree in economics. with reddit, you never know
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:55
Wall Street pump, get ready for the dump
