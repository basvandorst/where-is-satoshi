Maybe use the money to go to school, learn programming, start a company, make a profit, invest in real estate, earn rent off renters, use the usd to buy more bitcoin? But sure blow it on a car, get yourself some “pussy” and see how far that’ll go when that’s literally the only thing you got from the one chance you had to do something with yourself.

You know damn well if you bought a pizza with 50k btc you wouldn’t know how to act once you realize what you’ve done.
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:28:55
Me neither :/ Bitcoin is ruthless, it’s like “hey guys come back, everything’s fine again!” Then it’ll body slam you with another drop. Survival of the mentally fittest I guess.

Exactly what makes btc not fungible?

Nice, cardano sucks right ..
@_date: 2019-04-10 05:48:33
Btc less valuable because the inflation rate slows til it becomes a deflationary currency where that by definition means it’s supposed to increase in value?

It's a glorified checkbook, there's no confirmations, your guys are literally putting the problem under the bed and playing pretend with each other.

Can you seriously say that data is completely wiped from the system? Because as far as I know data is never actually deleted. It's just not shown. What type of database are you using to store everyone's data? Because you can simply type in some SQL commands and see everything. I don't do the crypto tax thing anyways, just don't get why you'd say it's completely wiped from the system when it never actually is.

Btc will back other currencies
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:52:27
You’re right, we haven’t had it happen yet. Although a reason the world is currently agreeing that the petro dollar (usd) is the dominant currency is because we do enforce it through war, but that’s another convo. 
Yes but when it comes to a complete basic healthy economy, you need real money imho.
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:51:52
I don’t sell

Hey golds and bitcoin are alright in my book
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:47:16
I’m pretty sure what you just said solidified a dead cat bounce.

We’ve never witnessed the usd collapse, can’t really fathom that honestly, but that’s the nature of inflationary currencies, look back to the romans, it only works when the currency is backed by something, being in the USA Herbert Hoover said “we have gold (bitcoin) because we cannot trust government” said bitcoin because it’s a better gold in my opinion. We’ve devalued the dollar extremely well. Don’t know how much longer our economy can keep functioning, it’s like someone doing physical activity in the olympics with a terrible heart condition, you cannot keep an economy healthy when the currency is based off of nothing, point blank. I’m 20 and I only have my all my savings in crypto, Will use cash though for ‘for sure’ transactions. Don’t see the point buying something with bitcoin currently, it’s soon to be deflationary.
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:17:39
? Drop yourself one ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:11:07
I’m 20, and 100 percent of the money I save is in bitcoin.

Try paxful.com you can buy amazon cards and sell them escrow through there, it’s how I was buying bitcoin when I didn’t have a bank account or Id.
@_date: 2018-12-20 05:18:53
This looks like a serious scam.

where are you finding your definitions at? Dead Cat Bounce: a temporary recovery in share prices after a substantial fall, caused by speculators buying in order to cover their positions.

Dead cat bounce.

I’ve done the same thing, and now I’m kind of picked on because I invest in it haha, Im 20 had that job for around a year and managed to save about 1.5 btc, hopefully a time comes where I get my day
@_date: 2019-05-06 14:03:45
It’s all only savings, that’s the only weird part about it, even if I could spend it easily, I don’t thinks I’d want to because sooner or later bitcoin will be deflationary and wouldn’t make sense to buy one car with bitcoin today when you could’ve bought two next year you know
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:37:56
Right on it buddy, it’s called a dead cat bounce.
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:36:32
