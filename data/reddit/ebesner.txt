It makes sense. The exchange have the liquidity to bootstrap the LN. Moving that liquidity on a channel is probably a good thing for both customers and the exchanges. It also acts as an audit mechanism whereby all of the deposits are on the channel and the exchanges that are tempted to create fractional reserve coins could be identified more easily.

To add to your point, people need to specify whether they are talking about money supply or goods and services price inflation. Increasing the supply of money could lead to goods and services  price increase but so could supply and demand.

One cannot inflate the supply of Bitcoin, I agree but this would not prevent the inflation of prices in the event of a reduction of supply or an increase  in demand for basic necessities such as food, water and energy.

Print some satoshis on paper wallets until your bathtub is full and swim in those. At least they have real value and probably some therapeutic value as well...who knows.

I would propose a simpler calculation. 
If one could compensate the mining pool for renting their mining operation for a day or two by paying them the block reward plus a markup, this seems to better reflect the true economic cost of an attack. 
For example, with the price of a Bitcoin at $6800 USD, the bitcoin block reward for a full day is $12,3M, add to this a 50% markup and it would be close to $19M per day to rent the entire network, if such a thing is possible. It would be $9,6M per day to get 51% of the hashing power.
EDIT: The revenues from the block rewards during the attack would also contribute to offset the costs. So in the end it is more like $3,4M.
 Alternatively, you can create a pool to federate miners and put aside money to give mining bonuses to attrack 51% of the hashing power. This eliminates the need to rent the hashing power.  To be consistent with the example above, giving a 50% bonus on top of the block reward, would cost $3,4M per day to attract 51% to an attacking pool. 
 
EDIT: In the end renting a controlling stake of the hashing power comes down to the same thing as controling a bunch of mining pools and subverting miners into joining those pools. 
As you can see this is far less than the billions of dollars you came up with. 
EDIT: In your model, buying the equipment equates to having a majority stake in the network in which case game theory would kick in and as such, the attacker, by owning 51% of the network would be a fool to destroy the trust of the network he just bought.

The author states the following    "The S9 will return the original investment after 13,829 days while the T1 only takes 5, 423 to pay back the $2,700" 
Who, in their right mind would wait 15 years for a payback of the initial investment. Neither Bitmain nor Halong would be in business selling  equipment with such a terrible ROI. 
Numbers don't add up. Am I the only one seeing this?
EDIT: maybe I should read 13,8 days and 5,4 days as payback periods respectively but that seems very short.

I trust the Chinese to be rational.

I agree with you. It is unlikely to happen. Most miners and manufacturers have to much at stake to participate in such a plot against the Bitcoin network. The same is not true for many of the very small PoW networks.

From reading some of the comments, clearly many posters did not bother reading the article or visiting the Quebec energy regulator's website to understand the details of the decision. 
To sum it up, Hydro Quebec is proposing a dedicated block of 500MW of power and a dedicated service category for miners. This represents nearly 12,5% of the hashing power of Bitcoin.  Until this new tarrif is in place they simply cannot honor all the demands which represent 40% of it production capacity without jeopardizing it's ability to service its existing market. Even after, only a percentage of miners will be serviced by the proposed 500MW. 
The prohibitive temporary tarrif is only in effect until the new tarrif and the associated terms and conditions go into effect.

Maybe the social medias will be the path to widespread adoption of LN. 
For example, if influencers create their own LN nodes for their followers to easily connect to it, this could spreads like fire. LN nodes need to be offered as an easy 'one-click' solution to the masses. I can see mobile operators offering LN node hosting services to their customers. As a matter of fact, any large consumer based business could start offering LN node hosting just in a similar way they all offer a credit card account.  They could even offer bitcoin refill services.  Most people would then be able to participate in the LN based economy without the need to ever go through an exchange.

Bitmain has a major stake in manufacturing and mining for the Bitcoin network. It would not be in their best interests to destroy the network by doing a 51% attack. As a matter of fact they are likely to monitor the situation closely to avoid being perceived as a potential attacker as even that could damage the trust people have in the network.

Perhaps you could use ounces of gold as a comparison. The production of gold is fairly predictable and as far as I know, there is a much lower risk of inflation of its current global inventory. 
However, should there be a trend away from gold and into Bitcoin, we would still face the infinite growth of Bitcoin expressed in ounces gold. 
How about using something that people will always need such as an average standardized food basket and compare the evolving purchasing power of Bitcoin over time expressed in how many food baskets one can purchase, then the model is more likely to be stable over time regardless of fiat inflation.

This is probably to support their margin trading business. The btc on loan are protected though the margin call mechanism but in a flash crash it may not work fast enough to protect it all.

Isn't it what the Lightning Network is all about : a one-to-one bitcoin back transaction system that settles on the bitcoin blockchain?

There seems to be a paradox here. How can people be motivated to spend their crypto when it is more lucrative to hodl. 
Today, most people spend between  2% to 5% to transfer fiat to an exchange. Why would they do that to buy coffee?
My guess is the path to change will most likely be through other economic activities such as remittance and international activities which will benefit from removing middleman commissions or political restrictions. Perhaps nations such as Venezuela might become precursors without realizing it. 
I suggest the following paper for more details. I am not the author.

How do we know a stable coin is full reserve? Money they deposit in the bank?  That does not make it full reserve unless you have the hard cash issued by the central bank in a vault under you control or deposited in an account with the central bank. Most stable coin issuers probably try to make money investing your cash in short term Treasury bonds that are 100% guaranteed by the issuing government. Banks do the same with overnight rates of central banks.

That's a lack of determination on their part. Instead of creating some sort of stable coin based on a basket of fiat currency they could have issued a Bitcoin backed stable coin until Lightning becomes ready for prime time and then later do a one-to-one trade-in. 
I think the reason why they went with a basket of fiat is because they can trade your fiat for a token and get a good return on that fiat money while you get nothing on their token. This logic though may soon melt away and central banks flirt with negative rates. 
They can always adjust the basket from time to time with a mix of other assets such as crypto, precious metal, etc.

A vacationing American businessman standing on the pier of a quaint coastal fishing village in southern Mexico watched as a small boat with just one young Mexican fisherman pulled into the dock. Inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna. Enjoying the warmth of the early afternoon sun, the American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.
“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American casually asked.
“Oh, a few hours,” the Mexican fisherman replied.
“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American businessman then asked.
The Mexican warmly replied, “With this I have more than enough to meet my family’s needs.”
The businessman then became serious, “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”
Responding with a smile, the Mexican fisherman answered, “I sleep late, play with my children, watch ball games, and take siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings I take a stroll into the village to see my friends, play the guitar, sing a few songs…”
The American businessman impatiently interrupted, “Look, I have an MBA from Harvard, and I can help you to be more profitable. You can start by fishing several hours longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra money, you can buy a bigger boat. With the additional income that larger boat will bring, before long you can buy a second boat, then a third one, and so on, until you have an entire fleet of fishing boats.”
Proud of his own sharp thinking, he excitedly elaborated a grand scheme which could bring even bigger profits, “Then, instead of selling your catch to a middleman you’ll be able to sell your fish directly to the processor, or even open your own cannery. Eventually, you could control the product, processing and distribution. You could leave this tiny coastal village and move to Mexico City, or possibly even Los Angeles or New York City, where you could even further expand your enterprise.”
Having never thought of such things, the Mexican fisherman asked, “But how long will all this take?”
After a rapid mental calculation, the Harvard MBA pronounced, “Probably about 15-20 years, maybe less if you work really hard.”
“And then what, señor?” asked the fisherman.
“Why, that’s the best part!” answered the businessman with a laugh. “When the time is right, you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”
“Millions? Really? What would I do with it all?” asked the young fisherman in disbelief.
The businessman boasted, “Then you could happily retire with all the money you’ve made. You could move to a quaint coastal fishing village where you could sleep late, play with your grandchildren, watch ball games, and take siesta with your wife. You could stroll to the village in the evenings where you could play the guitar and sing with your friends all you want.”

I am no lawyer but I am wondering if a sales contract could simply state that upon bitcoins being transferred to the seller's specified bitcoin address with 3 confirmations, the transaction is deemed executed and the ownership automatically transferred to the buyer without any further dues.
In the future, a smart contract could replace the entire process of going to a trusted third party to execute a sales transaction.

Looking at bitcoin through a trader's eyes can be nerve wrecking I admit, but probably no different than FX traders. However, if you see bitcoin as an alternative to a debt based fiat system, which only fuels the perpetual growth of debt, speculation and consumerism, it does not induce the same effects.
A recession will not have any impact on the supply of Bitcoin. It will continue to be issues every 10 minutes until 21 millions are mined and no monetary policy will be able to change that.
Should central banks not be able to address a multi-sector bubble induced massive failure of greedy banks though QA, the entire debt/payment system could grind to a halt in a few days and all of the sudden cryptos would become an alternative. I must admit that today's cryptos are probably not ready to handle the volume but that's just a matter of time.
I remain excited about what the future holds for cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange in general and how it can support healthy economic activities without suffering from the downside of private bank issued debt based monetary systems. I wish a few more economists would look into how this would work.
