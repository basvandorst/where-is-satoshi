You better believe if your product becomes popular you will be competing w your manufacturer, and if it's something easy to manufacture you will be competing with hundreds of factories IF it becomes popular. Even large companies like Nike can't control this. But if you are popular you are probably making some decent money before you get undercut.

Since I have seen you ask this in several places and I think your comparison is horrible I felt I had to reply. When you started eBay 14 years ago they had already been in business for over 6 years. How many calls you think they got when they started? I think Purse will iron out all the issues by their 6th year. 
As for my experience I couldn't be happier with Purse, fast customer service when needed but most of my contact was trying to make sure I had understood their service before I did something wrong. Saved thousands through them. 
Also I have no idea why OP us doing a 5%, I avg 35%.

I think all exchanges are locked. There still might be one.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:56:51
Childs play!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:35:17
100% agreed!  
I fear the only reason price is holding is cuz all exchanges are locked.

This, of course, assumes they see these things (your viewpoints) as problems. 
"Crypto-Fiat is just the next sub-par kick-the-problem-down-the-road solution to the current monetary system's man-made flaws."
I agree, but what if it does make the financial market (banking/trading/lending) faster, more efficient, and cheaper. Would that not be a net win? allowing people to keep more of their wealth. I don't know, it might bandaid the problem for decades until the next one pops up. But IF it does do these things (state crypto) I don't see why they wouldn't be tempted to outlaw BTC. They could control outflows to dark money shadow/offshore banking. I hope not, but I have yet to hear a plausible reason in that scenario (where state crypto does work and people received those benefits) that they would benefit from not outlawing BTC. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:13:37
Wow. Just. Wow. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:11:16
Yep. Have also noticed.  At this rate it will be down to far to justify using it within a year, lol. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:48:10
Wow. This is exactly what I was thinking.  Do you think they outlaw BTC? Cuz I could definitely see that as an option, sell it to the peeps as a more secure, faster, cheaper financial system and also control/slowdown/eradicate dark money and shadow and offshore banking. What say u?
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:44:13
Ok so currencies will still be traded and paired as usual, they will just move faster more efficiently and all be connected to their countries blockchains and only allowed to exchange for other sovereign crypto. They would still compete against each other as they do now. Of course gold will still matter it has been money for millennia. BTC not so much. Make BTC illegal. Make cash illegal (if even need to, cash is on its way out anyway). In that scenario of course it would be in states best interest to outlaw BTC. They can effectively control/eradicate black market/money and shadow banking. 
I realize this couldn't happen anytime soon, and just wonder IF these state sponsored crypto work could that be an outcome. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 13:49:01
Do you have any published scientific papers?
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:34:18
So essentially you just don't believe they will outlaw it. I hope you're right but it is an interesting thought experiment...  What if they sell it to the populous as a positive because they can make all sectors of finance(banking/trading/lending) much cheaper. They can give more people more access to the financial markets. But also slow down if not wipe out outflows into black money and markets as well as have tighter (eradicate?) offshore accts. 
I know this would not be good for the people but I fear IF their private chains/state crypto does work , this could be an outcome. I know they can't shut BTC down per say but they could render it pretty useless in that scenario. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:18:47
They can't. I said they can't shut it down, that's not the part I'm talking about, they will make it near impossible to get your USD/CAD-coin in and out of BTC. Make business sell things only w the official crypto.  Shriveling the market. Bitcoin will still exist but won't be very valuable in a world only legally allowed to transact in state sponsored crypto.  That is what I'm wondering. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:51:52
This guy fucks 
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:58:20
The comments here seem shortsighted. What happens when the banks across the globe connect their blockchains and outlaw BTC? 
Serious question. I realize people could still use BTC but won't be able to buy much or cross over to state run currency. Effectively making it useless. I hope I'm missing something.

And in your world how do you trade your value for other things of value? In other words where do you store this utility from labor etc?
@_date: 2015-11-14 05:48:01
Thx and I get it. I typed this on mobile. Ironically,  you have used "u" more than I  :)
@_date: 2015-11-14 02:41:13
I don't know understand what you're asking. Are you saying if they get banned nationwide? Or right now with the current situation in New York?
If you mean right now, then yes they could continue to operate w Bitcoin because the AG has filled a lawsuit and they will hopefully have their day in court. Both FD and DK are continuing to operate in NY, just no more deposits for FD right now. The issue is the AG has pressure the payment processor to stop taking payments. But they are not illegal (yet, if ever).

I have been thinking this would happen for 5 years now, and while I feel it is inevitable it won't happen anytime soon. They will hold on and keep the status quo as long as possible. What we are seeing are minor breaks in the system. Imo it will be decades before we move to another economic and financial system. And I think the pressure will come from automation and job loss. I wish it would happen sooner so we can move pass the mundane antiquated systems and ideology we have now and explore humans true potential when the majority of us aren't chained to a cubicle and can follow our passions. I'm just glad when it crumbles down we will have this technology to utilize to keep the world moving forward.

I've been seeing people post about this in many different comment sections for a few weeks now. Just thought it was one of those "my dad made 5000 on the internet" type things. 
This cannot account for the volume. Imo if this Chinese volume is real (not bots on exchanges), it's because of the devaluation of their currency by the gov. But I guess zerohedge already has that scoop.
