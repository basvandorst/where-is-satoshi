Transferred BTC from GDAX to Binance an hour ago and I have nothing showing as pending yet in Binance. 
Is this normal?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:00
Is there anywhere that will display the BTC/USD exchange rates of two different exchanges on the same graph?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:13:23
What's an easy way to keep track of how much you're actually earning (or losing!)?
I mean, I've bought coins at different rates on the different exchanges with different fees, I've moved from coin to coin...
I can look at at the market rates and say, yeah, that's x% higher than the highest rate I've bought in at, feel good about that, but that's pretty shoddy.
Should I just Excel it?

I've just bought some btc on Revolut at a substantially lower rate than GDAX (below 19,000) which seems really weird. 
If I transfer this btc to gdax while the rate is is still so different, will I lock in that additional value?
Sorry if this is a superb dumb question!

While awesome, this r/ is populated by 99.99% noobs (no offence, I'm one too!).
Where else do people in the know hang out?

Loop da loop!
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:40:35
In all seriousness that is true. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:16:52
Wah!Fuck you Binance and you crashy ass exchange!

Order books will open at 9am PST in post-only mode and stay that way for at least an hour, according to their announcement:
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:17
Surely from the posts we can surmise what's gonna happen once trading goes live?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:34:34
Rode the dirty dragon and jumped off at a high back to the safety of BTC. now - how to split my lovely BTC to make the most of the coming wave?!
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:38:38
I'm in the same situation. No wallet, everything on exchanges, none listed here. Would love some advice

What colour Lambo should i get? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:34:51
I feel your pain! I have BTC stuck in transfer from GDAX to Binance, reckon it's going to take till morning to get there at this rate!
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:36:35
Can other people take advantage of this? I mean, mimic the people creating these walls and try to make these small gains on small investments?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:49:54
GDAX estimates this transfer will take around 9 hours, so I guess I'll wait :(
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:07:44
Noob alert.
You mean you expect the price will drop sharply from this high on Monday? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:20
Oh man this is so exciting!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:36:22
It's taking ages to move Bitcoin from GDAX to Binance right now. Some people saying change to ETH first then send that to Binance. I haven't tried that today but when I did that a couple of days ago it was quite fast (30 mins or so I think).

Thanks for the info

Dip on Binance BTC/BCC which I anticipated (people expecting a crash and dumping) but keeping an eye on the orders it seems that buying is stronger than selling, so that dip over at Binance has levelled off, and I reckon it'll go back up now.
Edit. I'm an idiot. Everyone ignore me
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:21
This. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:35
A little help please :)
I bought some BCH in today's dip expecting to rise before the Coinbase fiasco happens again. I'm on Binance.
I am expecting this to crash back down to at least today's earlier levels and I'd like to sell a chunk of my coin before that happens.
What's the best way to get set up and ready for that, and what do I need to be worried about and prepared for?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:35:03
OK. You have:
* a bunch of people excited to dump their BCH out of revenge.
* another bunch who appear to have been pumping the market who are quite possibly getting ready for a dump. 
* another bunch who hold BCH from the fork who may realistically expect the price to go up and will therefore hold because: 
* there is a final and fast growing bunch who are new to all this, don't know or care about the politics or the other exchanges, and who will see a new coin generating a lot of fuss, a lot of media coverage, called Bitcoin (yes I know!), against a background of BTC dropping and this new Bitcoin going skywards. They've seen the recent mega rise in BTC, this new Bitcoin seems more affordable, at the start of a curve not at the top, time to jump on board the gravy train!
That's what I see. I have no idea how it's going to play out!
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:40:04
Ok, dumbass question! Lol
I realise now that I can't get the btc out of Revolut. No worries. I used it cos I'd hit my limit elsewhere and already had an account set up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:36
HODL TO THE MOON!
Or something ;)
But seriously, because i think it has a long way to go up over the next hour or so.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:26:55
Thanks. I'm trying to learn. I'm not intending to day trade, but it is interesting to get perspectives on the motivations behind these fluctuations.
If I understand, you expect a slight gain, maybe to 19.5k, and then a drop as people cash in?
I can see how that would set fair weather buyers into sell mode, maybe dropping the price back down to 18-18.5k, but you expect the priced to hold around this point?
