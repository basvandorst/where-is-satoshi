Chat with your bank. After I made 3 purchases, the next time I was in the bank I had one of the officers  one up to the line and chat with me about coinbase / purchasing bitcoin. 
Once I walked them through what coinbase does for KYC and a little more about BTC and crypto they said they were glad we chatted. Our convo went a long way at putting them at ease.
 It's a time to educate the employees of the bank about crypto. As long as the employees feel better, there will be a less chance of on ramps being blocked. Its amazing how far a person to person convo will go.

Paper and hardware wallets (ledger, keepkey, trezor) are consider cold storage. Although, I'm not familiar with paper wallets... hmm. 
Any idea what kind of upgrades the Trezor or Ledger received - hardware/software specific or blockchain (forks, network, etc) kind of upgrades?

Yeah. If BTC is to be treated like a currency might as well! Plus the landlord was listening to a news report  about BTC when I dropped off the check. And I told him if he's serious about it, I'd be willing to pay $100 of my rent in BTC. 
Also, wouldn't be the first thing I've purchased with BTC, either.

Only cost about $200,000 to buy the house from my current landlord. And I'd pay you the equivalent of $900 in BTC each month!

That's pretty much all fiat currencies. They're back by faith.

I always recommend the book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" as a beginning's investors book. For cryptos, a good starting point I would be "The Age of Cryptocurrency", it'll give you a better idea on the details of how BTC started and a good foundation for other cryptos as well. Lately, I recommend the book "Money: Master the Game", very good general topic about money and investing.

Very true. After talking to the landlord about the potential of using BTC as a way to pay for my rent, it seemed more of a "light bulb" moment... going from "BTC is a weird thing" to "BTC is a money?!". 
Plus, last we talked, it sounds like I'd be I would only pay a small portion of my rent in BTC (maybe $100 a month) so that way the landlord would minimize his exposure to currency fluctuation and he would still get a majority of his money in USD to cover his monthly expenses related to my rent. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:18:44
Fair. I suppose getting the landlord to accept part of the rent in BTC is more to get him comfortable with the idea of cryptos and their potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:57:33
What if BTC was being held in a diversified investment portfolio. Would you recommend selling BTC to rebalance the portfolio? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:59:56
Well, if bitcoin is to be used as a currency, then it should be able to be used in day-to-day transactions. Plus, I make about $75 a day from mining in a pool.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:10
Well... more like I have looked at those notes and still have questions. Similar to why we still employ teachers - to offer guidance when people have questions. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:02:06
That is true with normal money too. 
But if people aren't willing to spent a digital "currency"... is it really useful in day to day use?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:30:30
Now, if only my landlord would accept rent payments in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:45:21
Not really. I'm trading currency for a good - in this case a place to live for a month.

1. Make a budget and figure out how much money you can allocate to investing. 
2. Read books about investing and cryptos. 
3. Diversify your investments so not all your investments are in one basket. 
4. Read more books.
... Also, all three of those are good. Just depends what kind of style of crypto you think has growth potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:16:15
Hmm, I mean if no one spends their BTC, then no one wins. Doesn't really fulfill the role as a "medium of exchange" if it just sits there. 
But I suppose most people are using BTC as more an investment than a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:55:21
It was more of showing the landlord that BTC could be used as a currency. Plus, he was curious and didn't think BTC could be used in "the real world". So, are my proposal he's curious. Of course, he'll want to take steps to minimize his currency fluctuation risk. But even if I'm paying only $100 BTC of my $450 rent to him in BTC, it's still a win and a proof of use for the fellow.

With how many people I see going into debt from "keeping up with the Jones" ... it's doesnt surprise me why so many people cannot accumulate wealth. 
Too much spending not enough saving or investing.

True, the economy of the US is built on consumerism! Sadly, I don't think people really understand what interest rates, inflation, deflation, or even how to create a balance sheet to view their personal situation. 
Understanding debt, investing, and savings, would be big steps for the US population.  
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:11:36
I'm from the US. But my statement is backed up from observation of my friends since graduation. A few examples:
(1). Buddy graduated from college with $20k in debt and started working at a $28k IT job. I helped him create a budget for aggressively paying off debt and in 2.5 years he was debt free. He spent 2 more years saving/investing and is now getting his masters with very minimal additional debt. 
(2) A buddy graduated from college debt free and was an Army officer. He is currently making $75k. I visited him down in Fort Bliss (El Paso, TX) and he spent his money on "Jones" like things and has about $30k in credit card debt. 
(3) My current girlfriend. She graduated with $50k in debt. She has lived simply for 2 years and has less than $20k left in debt. 
It really does come down to not spending more than you make and living within your means. Medical expenses are a different beast for sure. Everything else though, just requires a plan and not living excessively. 
Myself. I graduated with $55k in student debt. I spent 5 years aggressively paying down the debt. I have $7k left in student debt and investing nearly $1k a month (50/50 in stocks and cryptos) while saving $500 a month. 
It really comes down to financial understanding. Living within your means and hustling to get out of debt.

"Transfer to investment" would of been my pick. I've had to have this convo with my bank in a face to face manner. Even had to give them a little bit about how crypto work. They seemed very receptive and curious about it. Definitely reduced their "fear" of bitcoin after having that talk. 
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:57:58
Make a lot of valid points. It is super hard to find good info about bitcoin that isnt all meme and "hodl" crazy. 
Felt like late 2018 and early 2019 has been a hard struggle trying to find quality people in the crypto space with a head on their shoulders.

It's amazing how much pushback I get to recommending DCA to other investors. 
It truely is one of the best strategies for investing! Takes so much of the "timing" and make the process automatic.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:55:41
Fair point. Never thought about DCA being viewed as a "101" strategy. 
Guess I've spent too much time talking to beginner investors that I've begun to see DCA as the "only" strategy.
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:13:48
Your answer made the most sense. Because the government says debts and taxes are settled with this "fiat" currency. Makes sense. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:22:01
Agreed. After learning about BTC in 2016, reading The Bitcoin Standard in 2018... I had to jump into gold and silver investments. 
It's rather silly that people think it's one or the other. Also, silver is just to stack :)
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:42:22
Why cant I have both? Lol
