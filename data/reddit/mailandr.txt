Can my BTC, that I used to open a channel,  been sendt while my channel is open? No? So tell me, whats the difference to alternative blockchains? It's like trading BTC for XXX and using XXX to purchase things....

Congrats, biggest BS I found today.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:07:51
Let's assume 1k legacy txs are needed every day for LN opening/closing, would you still mine? Would you mine while get rewarded less? I assume it will be easier to run 51% attacks, with less work to be proofed.
This sub is full of memes without real technical explanation. Srry, i'm not convinced yet and so it's way easier/cheaper/faster to do txs with an alternative (for now).
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:08:46
Im talking about on chain BTC to BTC txs, without using LN.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:55:24
I'm still not convinced. It's still easier and cheaper to use alternative coins rather than running a node on a dangerous main net. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:47:06
What? Did you even looked into alternatives?
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:50:39
A BTC user talking about resources? You forgot something - /s
Faster cheaper while still safe, I can list you at least 5 alternatives.... btc king bla bla bla
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:40:10
How is this different to an alt-coin?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:40:48
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:45:28
Yeah I've noticed, but how do you keep consensus if the amount of miners will decrease? Miners will move away without something to proof and without rewards.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:09:43
I guess so, they are even telling me that it will kill all alt's....
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:33:34
Are you serious? It's running for a month now? It was only pushed out because people complained about fees and a full mempool. Even the dev team is calling it dangerous, at least they are honest.
There's no rational reason to prefer it over a blockchain that is running for months without flaws, the only reason is because people believe in it, but that's not a sign for the "best solution" and not a sign for success.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:57:34
Just trying to integrate...
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:18:02
Titel - BTC
Article - BCH
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:23:18
I can, that's why I never will have BTC. Why should I? while other projects give me the same service, faster and cheaper. Do you guys really assume that BTC will kill all altcoins? This is laughable. BTC is down to 35% market value, the rest will contribute to projects with real scaling solutions
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:05:47
5% on bitpanda
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:12:46
Yeah, but I can't do it while my BTC is locked away to keep the channel open.
Edit: I will not answer anymore, in my opinion LN is one of the worst scaling solutions out there. I'm not going to hate on you guys, you're in this game with money on BTC, but be serious BTC with LN will not kill anything...
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:00:46
I don't even want LN, wheres the point of LN when I can use a alternative without lockin away money...
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:06:55
For bullshit go to r/ethereumfraud, seriously the only guy that was posting there isn't posting anymore...
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:23:54
Btc community in a nutshell. You don't understand that coinbase had a huge influence in btc's mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:16:33
How long is segwit out? Im just curious...
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:10:34
I can't have 50 € disappear..... are you aware of the transaction costs?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:06:41
Explain, also explain why btc is not overpriced.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:32:10
"Proof"? Wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:37:18
Why not. Get a overall view and build your own decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:25:37
People are delusional, I hope you will understand how much influence coinbase have in btc's mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:28:37
He's not stealing the LN code, this is not how crypto works...
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:22
"This subreddit had turned into a a place filled with get rich people, trolls and idiots."
And your doing a good part on this situation.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:45:43
You're a ridiculous...
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:32:04
I'm not from the states and i'm not using coinbase. But i'm tired of your pitchforks and your childish behaviour, you don't recognise and approve that coinbase did his part with helping btc mass adoption. Remember 2 weeks ago? Everyone was hyping coinbase because it reached the first spot on app dl rankings. 2 weeks ago!!! Now your accting like a offended child. I guess there is fear, because BTC's future isn't that clear anymore. You've shitting your pants while at the same time you try to find someone to blame, someone that caused that fear in you, and NO it's not coinbase, it's the fact that BTC's future is uncertain and nothing else!
And for my last statement: if you have problems with the unregulated world -&gt; crypto isn't the right place for you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:40
Just do it like ETH. Make one for the technology (/ethereum) and for price/memes (/ethtrader)
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:14:33
How will the wallet manage the required amount of BTC? What will happen if you can set the amount, but your counterpart don't got enough BTC to lock away?
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:17:24
Bitpanda, charging 5% fee but it's a legit exchange based in vienna. The gold verification was done in 5 minutes via 3rd party app and video call.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:20:17
So you got your answer, user are converting into other coins for cheaper txs.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:52:19
Andreas and rogers situation and why it's so important, that's the titel. You can't have the answer without getting information from both parties.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:21:46
No problem, just use ETH!
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:33:16
I dont know. I dont hold BTC and I dont want to spread fud, try to find more informations and make your own decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:51:29
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:09:41
No, fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:32
Their service is always down after a price dump....this is nothing new
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:00:39
Now post this on r/btc and make your own decision.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:00:23
At least your smart....
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:37:02
What the hell.... look at the charts, the amount of txs fee (0-300) are still increasing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:38:49
Their service is always offline after a price dump. Jesus... get your shit together....
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:05:13
~~use~~ hold
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:24:42
Wtf... yeah this got eaten up. But all others, from 0-300 are still rising..... 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:14:56
Whats wrong with my history?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:14
HODL HADR!
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:08:41
Are you aware of the transaction costs?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:10:31
It's more like 200MB
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:08:45
Why preface? I'm literally telling him, throughout the whole conversation, to take a look into both sides, and for that I dont need to preface anything.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:09:54
Yeah its useless. All the devs working with and on ETH should have spoken with you before developing on ETH.../s
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:08:29
"Sum up what they did to US" ... dont use their service if you're aware of all this "problems".
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:26:26
Now sum up the things that coinbase did for btc mass adoption. People are so delusional....
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:18:52
This node dropped out the low fee txs, 20-30 sat fees (lowest in this chart) and above are still rising
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:43:03
Whatever man....
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:59:58
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:31:25
Remindme! One year
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:44
 -175MB after dropping alot of low fee txs
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:35:08
Just in case....
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:52:05
Well, you should take a deeper look into LN. All I can see is that people will be uppset because they dont understand why LN is not a solution for everyone and everything. No hate...
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:17:55
At least someone is honest in here.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:59:23
Everything else is on their own blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:24:53
Not sure if this is crypto or 50 shades of grey.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:52:58
Another proof that r/bitcoin is the biggest shitshow of all crypto related subreddits. Your digging your own grave.... just to get things clear: I'm not into btc and bch...
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:02:26
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:14:19
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:51:07
Again. Whats wrong with that? Look into all related crypto subreddits, r/bitcoin is by far the biggest shitshow out there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:52:15
He's trolling you...
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:02:17
Yeah, im not related to btc and bch. Just giving him advise to look into it from another perspective. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:40:35
Segwit adoption is still low and lightning is not around the corner. While more and more people are joining crypto. From a short term perspective= I dont think it's getting better.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:38

@_date: 2017-12-08 11:31:10
Your just caught in the wrong sub reddit. If you want to learn about the technology look up the other coins. r/bitcoin is just a shit show
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:43:33

What are you talking about? Paranoia is hitting you hard, I guess... don't bother me if you're not able to respond to my first comment.

@_date: 2017-11-03 06:27:27
If you want to learn about blockchain technology in general - watch devcon3. I know ppl on this sub dont want to hear about other coins (downvotes incoming).... Ethereum is way more active when you look at it from a technical perspective. Dont be a fool 
and get your head into it - you will love it! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:42:23
Transfer it to a exchange and withdraw it for fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:24:47
It is the worst time to invest, its not so clear how this whole BCH thing will end. If you still want to invest - invest in a “safe“ alt. (Nothing is safe in the crypto world)

@_date: 2017-11-10 16:06:33
Mining alt's will not give you instantly profit. It will stay equal - depends on your kwh price. If alt's go up in price - their value goes up so you will gain profit while you already paid for the electricity.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:37:30
Nice to hear. There will be a live stream on youtube also search for ethereum foundation to find the agenda for today.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:50:18
Good enough to mine alt's.

@_date: 2017-10-30 17:33:23
Yes. ETH is not a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:51:26
It's so obvious.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:13:13
Yeah, you are right. But i cant see how BTC is going to handle this. From a technical perspective they are loosing pace compared to other coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:25:10
ETH does. 494.176k yesterday - while BTC had 333.871k. Average transfertime: 0.78 minutes.  Fee: 0,001 - 0,006$
