That's why I always do limit orders at weird numbers. I like to subtract 17 cents from my price. For example, buy or sell at $1199.83. That gets me ahead of the wall and my orders get filled first and still get filled even if the wall can't be taken down.

Well, the merchant side pays the fee. Credit card processing companies charge typically 1%-15% of the transaction amount. This is the USA.

About the hidden part. It is hidden in the way most people don't realize it is a tax controlled by the government. Also, the consumer price index, which is the standard for measuring inflation, is very corrupt. It basically excludes all the major things that are affected by inflation like food and energy.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:18:16
Ok, but it is price increase due to money creation. When factories in China don't produce enough computer memory chips and the price goes up for a year or two, you don't call it inflation. When a nickel mine shuts down and the price of batteries goes up, you don't call it inflation. Money creation is how the price of everything uniformity increases. Each dollar is worth slightly less simply because there are more of them in existence.

Be warned that anything you cash out from Robinhood is going to greatly increase your tax liability for the year. I highly suggest you hire a professional to help you minimize taxes. You need fiduciary (not a "financial advisor"). I'm sure there are advanced techniques they can use like retirement accounts, trusts, etc.

I'm talking about the CPI. You're talking about the CPI-U, which has it's own problems because it is for urban spending (excluding rural spending, military spending, etc.)
Inflation is money creation, which is directly controlled by the federal reserve bank through printing cash, quantitative easing, and allowing the government to create money out of thin air to fund projects.

Screw HSBC. It is the only bank that has ever closed an account on me. The reason seemed to be that I transferred money to a cryptocurrency exchange to buy bitcoin. They are really scared of bitcoin, as they should be.

You can usually claim lottery winnings anonymously. Even in a state like Illinois that doesn't allow an anonymous claim, you can hire a lawyer to set up a trust and have the trust "claim" the winnings.
But even if you don't do that, there is a big difference between just having your name in the public record vs. posting about it on social media with your face and details about where you put the money.

It's not that hard to do it right. Use a hardware wallet. You'll need to write down the recovery phrase on paper and save it somewhere. If you're afraid a losing things, make a few copies.

It doesn't matter that it's the same level as 17 years ago. Did you invest 100% of your retirement 17 years ago and never saved anything since? Assuming you save for retirement consistently over time, you would have been buying in at all the lows over the last 17 years too.

You're right. The value of USD fluctuates so badly. Better to just pay with BTC.
They're both currencies. They don't have a value. They have an exchange rate. You can't say one is fluctuating and the other is not.

Generally the contract a business signs with the credit card processing company states that they cannot charge more for a credit card transaction than a cash transaction. Also, they cannot enforce a minimum purchase amount for credit card transactions. Tons of stores violate these terms though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:08:53
Typical return of the S&amp;P500 is 8% after inflation. If you buy in to it over time, then retire and sell out of it over time, you'd expect an 8% annual gain on all your invested money. You don't get much better than that.
Sure, you could get lucky and buy a single company's stock at a great time or buy bitcoin at a great time. But those have lots of risk. It's more of a gamble than an investment. You wouldn't bet red at the roulette table and brag about your 100% gain being a smart investment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:03:44
If you don't need the transaction to process quickly, then I believe the fee can be very low. Less than the typical fee for using credit cards.

I had a business account at HSBC that I was using for my 100% legitimate bitcoin-related business. After a year or two, they suddenly closed my account. I think they were afraid something illegal was going on (it wasn't). Or are they just generally anti-bitcoin and want to make it harder to use?
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:52:34
Bitcoin can be very volatile from day to day. But I believe the long-term trend is very clear. If you're not planning to hold for several years at least, then this isn't an investment. It's just a gamble.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:17:02
I will be selling 1/2 my holding in 3 years from now. I expect the price to be good by then.

I tend to agree. Bitcoin has proven itself in my mind as a crucial technology that isn't going away. And yet we are in its very early days with tons of potential usage still to come. When there is widespread adoption with many people and businesses using bitcoin for everyday transactions, the value will have to go up significantly.
I don't think paper money will ever disappear. Someone working at IBM should know their company has been predicting for decades the the end of paper in the office due to computers. That hasn't happened either.

In a way this just highlight's the post's point. The British pound has lost value over time due to inflation. If you measure inflation using cows instead of silver, the loss is even more extreme. From $1.33 in 1600 to $1666.00 now per cow.

You can't really say how much USD you have based on your BTC. You need to exchange it to USD. You are just saying how much you potentially could have. But if you don't exchange it, then the price can go up or down.

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:45:01
Whatever you're buying probably has its price pegged to USD. So you are effectively converting to USD to make the purchase. And the business you're buying from is probably converting to USD because you can't pay rent and employee salaries with BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-29 04:04:56
I appreciate you wanting to help get people into bitcoin and stay in, however, I find it a bit scamy how so many of the posts/comments on reddit seem like a hard sell sales pitch to try to convince people to help pump up the demand (and therefore price) of bitcoin. I would rather it grow (or not grow) at a natural rate based on real utility. Not grow because of a big bubble.

It would be too strong for me to say I'm *counting on* bitcoin going to $200k, but it is indeed accurate for me to say I expect it. I figure it will have a 7x increase every 10 years. That's in line with what we have seen in initial growth so far. And bitcoin is just barely getting started. As it becomes more widely adopted, the value will have to increase constantly. With today's price at $5k, that would put it at $245k in 20 years.

BTC (like stocks) is valued at what people are willing to buy and sell it for. There is no magic rule that determines this price. And there is no rule to predict where the price will go in the future.
There are plenty of strategies out there to try to predict where the price will be going. You can look for patterns in the past prices. You can read news stories related to bitcoin. You can guess what businesses will do with bitcoin.
You can try one of these strategies. Or you can resign yourself to the fact nobody can predict the future.

This transaction paid 40 sat/byte. That is way more than normal. There aren't many transactions above 22 sat/byte (over the last 2 weeks). And even just 19 sat/byte will get confirmed in under 40 minutes 90% of the time right now.






6 sat/byte is a pretty small fee. That's $1.23 for an average sized transaction (256 bytes).
Credit card processing is also relatively expensive for small transactions. A typical processing fee is $0.15 per transactions **plus** 2% of the transaction amount.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:05:10
Because the difference between $1900 and $2300 isn't much (especially considering the volatility of bitcoin).

Don't feel bad. It doesn't matter. I bought most of my BTC at under $200.
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:34:05
For those wondering, the fee is a bit less than $2 right now for a confirmation in about 3 hours. And about $3.25 for a confirmation in 1 hour. This is the average over the last 2 weeks.
Of course, a part of the reason the fee is high when looking at it in USD is because fees are paid in bitcoin, which has increased in value compared to USD. So, even if you're spending $2 worth of bitcoin, you probably bought it for less than $2.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:34:54


You would pay an additional transaction cost to RBF the transactions. It wouldn't be worth it for such a small transaction amount.
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:49:26
Bitcoin remains worth the same as always. But the USD and all other currencies continue to crash.
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:31:07
For a $0.50 lemonade, I think it would be reasonable to just accept payments with no confirmations and if it "bounces" later, blacklist the customer or try to collect from them same as any business would do in case of a counterfeit bill, bounced check, or credit card chargeback. 
RBF isn't much of a risk with a low-value transaction like this because the fee to cancel the transaction would be more than transaction itself.
