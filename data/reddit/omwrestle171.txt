Well short term doesn’t look good but I feel we have already seen the worst at 9150 might get a double bottom there. We will be much higher when the beginning of September rolls around. Either we will be making a slow upward movement all the way till October/November or we are going to shoot up to 16k in September. Just HODL!
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:55:56
Ha called it, right at 9150!
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:57:09
Check out July 2016 we are going through that cycle 13800 was a high and 9300 was the low we will slowly go up till November and hit ATH in December. Everyone be patient!

Siacoin hasn’t failed just hasn’t been fully realized and adopted, probably one of the better projects that has a true purpose and is a good coin to diversify a crypto portfolio. It just got caught up in the hype of 2017.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:42:56
I have a feeling it’s not going to hit it. 9150 was the low like a couple weeks ago double bottom action. August is going to be magical!

8700 ish will be the lowest not saying it will go there but there ya go
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:22:43
You will regret this decision in 3 months
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:00:28
Looking like another pump and settle to 9980 action might have to wait another 24 hours to see the fireworks

While I get your concern I feel this is a good example of how people will fear the dip as btc starts climbing back out of a correction and making new highs. If you think holding on to your bitcoin in a bear market is hard wait till you start seeing your portfolio make huge gains and get the itch to sell in a bull market, only to find the price doubles a couple months later!
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:35:37
I’ll call a lil dump at 11400
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:34:58
I’m with you we might wick below 9k for a couple seconds but should hold structure around the 100ema. We are doing the exact same thing we did in 2015 coming out of the bear market
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:17:33
If you want to know the very bottom it’s around 8700 there ya go, see you at 16k in the fall
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:38:05
Can’t help but think we are going down to 6k if you look at the rest of the market they have gone through this pattern months in advanced and bitcoin is just taking its sweet time doing it. Long time hodler just saying what I’m seeing.
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:50:30
Now are you scared that you might not see 10,880 again. HODL!
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:14:07
Buy the ticket, take the ride.
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:33:32
If it goes below 9k go all in
@_date: 2019-06-09 18:56:25
I am thinking the same thing, it’s better to just hold on! Don’t want to be left out of the next huge candle up. It is really funny how the 2015-2016 chart is looking compared to now when we broke out of the bear market. If it keeps on repeating itself June will be a boring month followed by some positive movements in July and August we will shoot to around 12k. Oh and sell your litecoin in July!
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:45:45
People will start selling in July prior to the halving just wait till litecoin pumps again and then sell into btc and never look back, study the BTC / LTC ratio you’ll thank me later
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:02:33
Hold the 100 ema as support, is did break through it for a brief period but we touched it multiple times during the previous bull market
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:46:15
Next stop $10,200
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:52:05
I will probably not explain it correctly but it is when the mining award gets cut in half. So instead of the current 12.5 btc per block miners will get 6.25 btc. Please google it for further detail, but expected date for this to happen is May 2020 and this will be the 4th halvening in bitcoins history.
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:05:05
I’ll take another stab at your questions and say people are probably buying bitcoin to make a profit, but I would also say people buy it as a hedge against their own government/economy. So to be used as a form of currency might happen but as for now it is acting as digital gold.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:42:32
Step 1 - HODL
Step 2 - DCA buy
Step 3 - DCA sell a year after the halvening
Step 4 - Thank me Christmas 2021

You are relatively early, 10 years from now if you hold it will be the greatest thing you would do if this pans out as a world reserve for finance in a digital age of currency.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:15:40
Ok man wick down to 6700 6.9 was a good call though
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:56:37
Nah BTC Gonna hit 6.9k then hit 9-10k
