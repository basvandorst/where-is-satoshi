From the article in [The Guardian](


Consumers need to demand better payment networks, without single points of failure... or just switch to Bitcoin and wonder why you ever relied on banks/credit cards in the first place ;)

Also let the customer split the bill within the app, so each person at the table has a payment address and the confirmations start flowing in while the chef is busy in the kitchen.
This is especially appealing if the restaurant offers a discount for payment in advance with Bitcoin, thus passing on the savings of the credit card fees to the customer.

That's a pretty broad stroke of the brush... Some Technical Analysis methods are by their very nature better suited to certain types of instruments than others. At the same time, RSI will always provide useful insight about overbought and oversold natures of the market regardless of the liquidity or maturity of trading.
No one TA method will give you any insight, but a trading strategy built on a foundation of TA methods will give you a sound approach to trading and a basis for comparison.
I would consider anyone serious about trading Bitcoin yet ignoring any Technical Analysis indicators, is very foolish.

You would need advice on whether profits from investments denominated in bitcoins are subject to income tax. In most countries this is a grey area with language to categorize whether your investments were of a personal nature, or that of a trader with the intention to make a profit/income from your trading.
I don't know how authorities would determine whether a deposit to just-dice was made with the intention of gambling or as an investment, so it would make sense to pay income tax on profits from just-dice regardless and keep in the clear.
If you are indeed clear of any income taxation on the securities trading profits, then you only need the bank statements showing when you've purchased bitcoins on an exchange.


An argument can be made that keeping a record of every bitcoin is akin to recording the serial number of every bank note you've handled - therefor this level of record keeping is unfeasible and unwarranted.
Keeping bank statements along with a personal record of your bitcoin balance each month is advisable, as this shows that you made the effort to keep records. The onus is then on the authorities to find evidence to counter your record keeping.

Most common goods fluctuate in price within a country, and aren't at all comparable across different parts of the world. However, Big Macs are a good base product for this.
Ideally, we could leverage data from the [Big Mac Index]( and display it denominated in XBT. You would still need a current price for XBT in each of the local markets (local-bitcoins API?) since McDonalds doesn't sell Big Macs for XBT (yet).

Absolutely, purveyors of illicit goods are 'high risk' individuals, and we can expect they will continue to use any possible avenue to sell their wares for whatever currency their customers are willing to pay with.
The point I'm making is financial institutions should make their risk assessment on the individual, not the currency they are using.

I recall there being a similar document published by HM Treasury (UK) last year (I couldn't find a link to it just now). It would be interesting to see the similarities between the US and UK objectives.
Of course Bitcoin, being open and nimble, could encompass both countries' objectives to become the defacto standard for a modern payments network.

It is the same issue across all currencies and exchanges. Last week I tried to set an alert at 1200 CNY it wasn't available, however now the app can set an alert up to 1206 CNY - which is still below current price.
I believe the developer is doing some calculation like: 30day EMA +/- 20%
This fails to take into account periods with rapid price movements. The developer could push the range out to +/- 50%, use a 7day EMA, or allow numeric input so users can set their own "To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛" alerts ;)

Assuming that the intention of blocking BTCChina is to stop the flow of money out of China, then blocking other exchanges is of importance.

Too long, but I did read through (*unlike the OP*)
The most interesting argument is on page 6 under "Foreign Currency Exchange Services - Not Subject to money Transmission Act." - basically if a customer sends you fiat, but you only hold Bitcoin in their account then money is not transmitted.
This should mean that only exchanges such as Mt Gox that hold fiat currency on your account have to worry about money transmission in California.

He completely misses the point of "comparative value" - everything we can perceive has some value.
His greenback centered world view is simply too strong for him to perceive that bitcoin has any value compared to the greenback.
Anybody who does business online and across borders immediately recognizes the comparative value between bitcoin and any fiat currency they deal with. As a result, bitcoin has value intrinsic to it's means of exchange between fiat currencies.

You should keep bank statements showing the transfers to the bank account of each exchange where you've purchased bitcoins.
What is more interesting is profits from mining bitcoins. Early solo miners are able to refer to the timestamp of the blocks they've mined in the blockchain. Pooled mining is simply a matter of recording the dates of pool payout transactions.

They appear to be reusing Bitcoin addresses for ransom payments (perhaps a bitcoin address per C&amp;C server?):




The C&amp;C server is checking that a tx id is valid, but they might not be storing which tx ids have already been claimed.
Could you test on an infected machine, lookup the payment address on blockchain.info and copy the tx id of a payment already sent to that address, then enter that tx id on the workstation. If it decrypts your files then we've found a loophole.

I intend to do the opposite and declare my gains from actively trading bitcoins as profits that are eligible for income tax.

Since that's the first date that Satoshi got the 'word' out about Bitcoin, we should each make an effort to spread bitcoin further on November 1st.

Chrome/Firefox extension that sets up a multisignature transaction between a 'buyer', 'website', and 'seller'. 
* Extension creates green address
* Buyer transfers exact bitcoin amount to green address
* Extension creates multisignature transaction sending funds to Seller
* Product delivery or escrow resolution happens on other channels
* Buyer opens extension to see list of 'open' transactions, and confirms release of funds to 'Seller' for the item they have received
Use case: replacement to bitmit, that could be hosted by any website. This is a key part to enabling this, users are more likely to trust an extension to set up the escrow than each individual website implementing their own methods.

Couldn't agree more. SR was an easy excuse for traditional financial institutes to exclaim that Bitcoin is 'high risk'.

Agreed. Consider it as a 12 month rolling window of ownership:
* keep records of how you have obtained bitcoins
* keep a record of your bitcoin balance each month
* as long as your balance is &gt; bitcoins obtained in previous 12 months, then you are in the clear


Caveat: Income tax will likely apply if you invest your bitcoins in securities or actively trade bitcoins on an exchange (fiat or alt-crypto). This is a separate matter compared to holding bitcoins as a personal currency, and will apply even if such investments are made with bitcoins you held for 12 months.
