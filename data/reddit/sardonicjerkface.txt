ummm, no.
All it would take to hack the BitCoin PROTOCOL is enough reverse engineered clients in the public domain to outweigh the number of legitimate clients; a slim, but real possibility.
Since the validity of a transaction chain is validated by peer clients all it would take is more rogue clients than legitimate clients to undermine the entire system. Anyone who thinks this is not possible should research photonic microprocessing capabilities.
BitCoin is popular right now for all its benefits, which are many and valid, but ultimately nothing is 100% secure when it comes to computing. I do not have reason to think it is a con scheme, but I don't assume that it isn't either. It very well could be, and anyone participating needs to understand the risk they are taking. The only way to truly enforce sound currency is with metals, which don't have counter party risk, infrastructure dependency risk, system integrity risk, or default risk - unlike anything else.
