You should include more classmates.

damn those ddos'ers with their small fiuteks! thanks mate, hopefully it won't take long

One of the options at tje bottom sjould be 'Remind me too!' ;)
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:38:38
Ok, I think I get it now, it's weird a bit... a bit more complicated then I thought it would be :)
Well then, I'll better ask btc.sx how they're doing finding my btc, cheers :)
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:41:22
Ack, like BobAlison said, counter-intuitive :) Ok, I'll just have to read up some more on this stuff, ta!

Wasn't the first european one opened in Warsaw, just the other day?

Used  and it helped, finally I'm in
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:35:37
javascript enabled, time is correct, bitcoinity.org and genesis block run fine, don;t know what do
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:09:36
It still doesn't work for me, tried with different browsers but still can't connect to them, anyone else?
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:24:33
I have no idea what's wrong, everything else is running fine, maybe I need to delete some cookies or some shazzam
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:20:29
Not anymore they aren't, they trade on BTC-E now.
Edit: Nvm, they trade both now.

Hmm, strange that it had to use 3 different output addresses, I thought mine was only 1N1q1hmjg1iB9aDCfCsbAMkh5yWMWACZ5t. Just as a curiosity, why does it get sent like that, and not just the whole sum from one address to the other?
But anyway, they should have it then, they're saying they've got some problems finding it but hope it's just a glitch :)
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:21:29
any idea how to do the dns thingy? a bit lost here :)
edit: nvm,  helped, thanks :)

They are really going for a gold standard now.

i'm a bit scared :)

are you trying to push traffic towards ?
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:06:56
a couple trades every 5 minutes? hardly normal, and just like the last time
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:40:00
this Tom Carper is fun :) making anecdotes and stuff :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:02:12
I agree, the whales are a-romping.
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:48:56
why not start with bitbargain?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:09:44
just summarising so far, talking a lot about silk road, 'bad apples might spoil the bunch'
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:59:41
well this one is taking an hour now grandpa, are you sure it will be ok?
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:11:08
Maybe it's the fat cats, discouraging people to buy so that they can loot it themselves! 
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:28:42
I've never seen it lag this much, is this normal with them?
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:11:45
Doesn't seem to be doing much, stuck on $368.10. Any news yet?
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:14:21
well, for a late starter like me it was trading with leverage, using btc.sx at the moment... you buy, hold...???... 10x profit
read up on day trading and leverage... there's always a chance you can lose all you have :) but as others here can tell you, it's only going up, UP, UP! for now :)
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:47:24
let's just use the bitcoin community power of healing! by spamming their customer support! yay :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:27:41
Lucky you :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:36:09

Trade with confidence on the world's largest Bitcoin exchange!
Edit: we're finally seeing some movement.. looks like we're going to be ok after all...
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:49:39
Yes it's a daily, so you can't go long for more than 24 hours (long = buy and hold) and opening a position is quite costly, and it freezes when there are violent changes so you can't do anything ... I can't wait for the competition to open up their platforms to bitcoin so that trading isn't that constrained...
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:18:46
Yes, and here's my post about it: 
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:22:55
And your swords!
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:05:49
I care, a couple posts down, use my ORIGINAL thread for discussion (and upvotes :) )
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:46:31
Im quitting, I've learned a lot about daytrading so I'll switch to that for now, and fuck my customer service job. I don't even have a lot of bitcoins, but trading them and branching into shares is going to allow for some plushy living, it seems.
So yes, quit, if you can. Robots will take over most of the jobs pretty soon anyway :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:56:41
YES! Thats exactly what's happening! Glad somebody finally noticed as well!
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:38:09
are you suggesting... a c-c-c-crash?
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:16:11
Could someone please explain, in some detail, what the lower graph means?
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:35:00
Sure :) The more the merrier :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:38:04
yes, that means it's still down
@_date: 2013-10-24 11:41:04
i kinda like it, it's damn annoying when the close position button is greyed out, but you just have to put in those stop loss orders and maintain them... how do you use 'trailing stop' by the way? Does it work only on close on profit orders? How many pips do you use?
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:32:37
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:18:07
Yeah, am i rite??
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:58:09
barely any.

The ultimate tip :)

OUT OF NOWHERE
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:24:47
so just like in April then? DDoS Mt gox and grab the bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:01:17
Yeah, right, you know what's really going on? Everyone is buying coins on the cheap as we speak, no time to waste! BUY BUY BUY!
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:17:20
Yeah!
