I'm so jelly of my American counterparts :(

Ya I just see it as another bank account minus the fees and general douchiness......

Have you tried looking for wallets on his computer?

Congrats! You bought the dip now hodl!

I like livecoinwatch and coingecko

Congrats! Excellent choice. Unless you can easily walk to work/supermarket or whatever, it just makes more sense to have a car especially if you live in an area where it snows like a motherfucker for 8 months of the year.

That's very good advice for a hodler like me. Every time I look at prices, I feel like trading...

This guy at work told everyone he had 1 Bitcoin (half of which is sold for shitcoins) and now people won't leave him alone. Given the demographic in the city we live in, it probably wasn't the greatest idea to tell anyone...

That's good news now if only the banks could stop with those stupid cash advance fees. I like the fact that I can get my crypto instantaneously but after the whole coinbase fiasco, I don't think I will ever use my credit card on an exchange again.

Most impressive!

If you can find a piece of paper that has 12-24 random-looking words on it, that is his private key and should give you access to one of his wallets...like maybe try and see if he has any important papers stashed away somewhere like in a drawer

it's definitely smart...I wish I could bought more crypto before they implemented those codes....
