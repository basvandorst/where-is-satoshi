I was one of those. They were very cheap in those years you the point where you could forget about them if you didn't have many but years after you'd realize that something that used to be change now can afford a house, a car or at least a good computer

Yeah, it's normal that the price drops in a volatile investment like this. The thing is bitcoin was just doing fine a few days ago, even rising at a steady rate and then panic. It's not a long term issue unless something else was going on that I'm not aware of but I doubt it.

If only it worked as a currency...

I ask for betcoins.co and what I knew was it's not trustworthy
Many offers of freebitcoins.org and similar sites are surveys and phone SMS, almost all offers are doubtful.

SEPA transfers: What a pain. (Not only with Mtgox)

Bitcoin does not represent an economy like other currencies, in fact, it's merely an intangible product. Bitcoin has no control and that's one of many consequences, there is not a central bank who stabilize its value, nor an economy which works entirely or in an important part in bitcoins.

I don't know if you're ironizing but having an Android phone is not needed.
 is a good example and also bitcoins are an excellent way to send money to Kenya and Bitbob allows them to cash it.

Oh yes but if you don't reveal your name, I wouldn't trust in your advice.

I've buyed some coins trhough click and buy and seems to me a bit expensive.

Maybe I'm wrong but probably the 70 or 80% of all bitcoins have never been spent with bitcoin goods.
I'm an enthusiast of Bitcoin but I try to be reasonable.

Sounds like some idea of mtgox.

Little stores that convert its bitcoin prices to dollars and vice versa.
For me a small economy would be one which works  with bitcoins in a substantial part. I would like to know of a company which pays salaries in bitcoins and/or buy goods to its providers with bitcoins. No, I only know micro stores with no employees that "accepts" bitcoins adjusted by the dollar exchange value.

Tradehill SEPA transfer is free as far as I know. I did it once.

Almost all the stores accepting bitcoins today are using it in relation to the dollar value (And that's logical, their expenses are in dollars). Its stability (not the value itself) is important.
And unless bitcoin were a territorial currency, it should be a complementary currency. Thinking about bitcoin as though the relation with another currencies is not important is an error.
Today bitcoin lose or gain value within hours, looks more like a gambling game than a currency and it's hard to use it in the real life.

I didn't understand what's the problem with it.
@_date: 2011-09-11 04:47:13
There is no a real economy to spend bitcoins.
The unstable exchange value makes hard to hold bitcoins even for some days.

Who has said that Bitcoin was a panacea?
Bitcoin certainly is a revolution, I can send money (and I'm doing it right now) from one country to another in a fast and cheap way.  It's a big change. It doesn't save Africa of hunger, nobody has said such thing.

I agree. But instability is still a problem for that.

You could buy through Virwox (buying Linden with dollars and then...) or btcnow.net or youtipit (only if you have no hurry)
@_date: 2011-09-06 04:46:07
The only problem on bitcoin is its instability and this makes itself unsuitable for business. The price dropping it's nothing to do with deflation or inflation or -ations

Bitcoin is more than a speculation commodity. Sadly the most of people only stay in the bitcoin thing for that.

No, these are private keys created ad-hoc to make the cards.  You should import that private key to your wallet if you want to use the coins.
