Terrorists groups use USD from an embargoed Iranian bank and nobody's give a shit about that... Same for a public blockchain.

It's not an attack, it's just happening more frequently lately.
And i really think the way we're mining wasn't predicted by Satochi. Difficulty calculation isn't fit for this kind of *variable* network computation power. And we're heading there at full speed !
I get so much notifications from my node since the latest difficulty recalculation. Bitcoin process is taking much more RAM than usual due to the size of the transaction queue. I take at least 20 or 30 blocks to catch up for the time that is "lost" by not finding the block.
Increasing the block size will just delay the problem and we will get more and more delay due to miners focused on "Hey, the market is low, i will not buy mining power today"

Aww look, another bad luck 425920-&gt;425921...
Aww look, another bad luck 425922-&gt;425923...
And bitcoind is triggering another alert because &gt;1GB of RAM usage. And no, i'm not watching it more, i'm getting more alerts. At least 5 per days when i only got 5 per weeks until 6 days ago.
But as someone posted, i must **see things that doesn't exist**.
My point is: were heading towards a market-driven cloud mining, where we, users of the bitcoin economy, doesn't own the compute power and we can loose a tons of GHs/s in an hour because *there is no demand for it*.

Signalling is not the same as running code without community consensus. We saw it with BIP148 and uacomment nodes.

By trying to spread the "bitcoin node count doesn't matter". We already know it.
**The guys behind this massive increase of bip148 nodes think it's a vote. It's not. It's a stance against network abuse** and the chains will split regardless of the numbers of nodes. The ones who matters are the nodes who stays up, refusing non-segwit block after the 1 August deadline.
Edit 1: But the guys who don't know how BIP148 works will listen the ""hurr, durr, look, it's easily manipulated and will lead to nothing but problems". And that's what bothering me. Disinformation.

Do you think we could provide a full chain dump to help the ones who want to get on board at the last minute ? 
I mean i have some gigabytes to spare and i do a full backup of the blockchain every week anyway. Providing a link to that .tar.gz is nothing.

The origin is trusted and the changes from the trusted source are public and signed. The builder then ensure the user (by cryptography, who know, the kind of thing bitcoin rely on...) that the changes that are compiled are exactly the one publicly available.

Every bits of hashes/seconds help !

It means every transaction coming out of my electrum server after the 1st of August will be on the BIP148 chain and not the legacy one.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:20:52
I may be able to publish one. I'm just waiting for either a "BIP148" checkbox on electrum wallet or core dev pushing BIP148 into the master branch.
I'm a strong supporter of BIP148 but I want everybody to have the choice to stay on the legacy chain if they so desire -or want to split coins-. And actually, the electrum wallet is picking server at random whether or not they support/enforce BIP148.

Not begging for UASF. I'm begging for myself :) It take a significant amount of CPU/IOs/Storage and electric power to run a community node.
I'm looking forward to keep this Electrum server up for a long time. It was previously deployed with a 13.2 full node and Bitcore (Copay Wallet) from Bitpay.
I'll modify the banner during the scheduled maintenance to avoid confusion.

Hope they'll have a way to select which type of node you want to connect to, the BIP148 ones or the legacy ones. For now, it's just another electrum server showing on the global list.
