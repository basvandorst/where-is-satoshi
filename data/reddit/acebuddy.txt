My intuition is that for every $1 that wants to short on Monday (when futures begin trading) there's $10 that wants to hold it as an alternative asset. It may get smacked on Monday but I think institutional money is only going to drive things higher.

No, time won't tell. That valuation is insanity.

Sure you need a coin for a blockchain. You don't need bitcoin. Any technically sophisticated coin will suffice. Please explain to me why bitcoin in particular has to be around for blockchain technology to gain widespread use.

Crypto is worth 1/8 of all the productivity produced all around the world? No, that's completely insane. Crypto doesn't make anything. If you want to know its market cap limit, look at gold. It's not the same, but it's the closest thing we have to compare to. 
And gold is actually scarce, new cryptos are made every day and you can divide them up into tiny bits and still use them. You cannot do that with gold. 
Gold is around $7T, for comparison. 
Also, gold has a hell of a track record. The most amazing thing is you folks think Cryptos are a store of value.

I agree for the sake of productive assets like stocks. However, it is comparable when you compare its market cap to gold.

USD is very stable over the short term, and it is predictable over the long term. It decays roughly 2% per year, and you can pretty much count on that over the long run, so you can plan in advance to counteract it by purchasing assets that grow over time faster than the dollar decays. Stability and predictability are both great attributes. No currencies are stable over the long haul, we both agree on that. Bitcoin isn't even stable *in the short run*. It fails the first sniff test of being either a good currency or store of value. 
Will more blockchain usage make bitcoin more valuable? Maybe, sure. But it's not even close to a linear relationship, and it will likely share those gains with a host of superior digital currencies.

So now youre saying that bitcoin is useful as a means of exchange, which is quite contrary to what most people see it as (store of value /investment). Is it an investment or a currency? Good investments make bad currencies and vice versa.

People like you are the reason I can't take this community seriously at all. You blatantly ignored the more problematic number (22T) and instead compared someones net worth to a burger chain.  The 150B isn't the problem here dude, it's the 22T.
And then you put a smiley face at the end because you think are a genius and you just tore down his argument. It's so cringey.

Gold was a decent investment, but nothing the likes of what OP was suggesting. If bitcoin goes anywhere near 1MM it will make a terrible currency.

That still doesn't necessarily make it a good investment... I never said it wouldn't be used for anything at all, I simply implied that for it to become a good currency, it has to become a bad investment. It's one or the other, you can't have both. Things that go up a lot make bad currencies. Things that don't go up a lot make bad investments. And the bitcoin community can't seem to agree on which it is.

I'm extremely familiar with the concept of a market cap, thank you very much. How nice of you to assume I'm an idiot. 
That market cap is insane. That's the same value as the entire S&amp;P500. You're telling me that cyber tokens are worth all of that productivity? You know, the companies that make food, cars, cloud services? Give me a break, dude.
The fact that you think that market cap is reasonable makes you sound like an arrogant fool.

Great, so let's say blockchain improves everything by 20%, just to make a point. How does that relate to bitcoin's price? Bitcoin needs blockchain, blockchain absolutely does not need bitcoin. And if anything, the absurd cost of bitcoin would work against the productivity gains from blockchain. People that want to use blockchain for large transactions want one thing, price stability. They don't want an asset that keeps going up. Why? Because assets that can go up can also go down. The reason the dollar is so amazing is because it's very stable, or at least more stable and predictable than anything else. Bitcoin has none of those qualities. If anything you're making an argument for ethereum, but even that tech has been superseded already.
Bitcoin's value does NOT = Blockchain's value.
I can't believe I had to explain that in this subreddit... Oh wait, yes I can... because it's mostly full of  people who have no idea what they're talking about.

You have to be kidding me.

If you're worried about $50 in fees (assuming you use GDAX and not coinbase retail) on a $30k investment, you're really in the wrong space. 
Fees matter when you trade a lot. They're almost irrelevant if you expect the asset to appreciate. It's a one time fee, non compounding. The place where you hold your coins is way more important than a tiny fee.
