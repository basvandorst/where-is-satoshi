The funniest part of it all is fiat money is just numbers on screens. Most of it doesn’t actually exist but is loaned out in an interest earning manner. Becky needs to shut up.

He looks so ridiculous in that movie.

To be fair most "normals" still don't know about bitcoin, at least that I talk to. Explaining it is really difficult as well. "So it's this digital cash thing that uses a public ledger that is part of a distributed computer system. If you use it you are part of it so as the system grows so does it's resilience" then you have to go right back to "ledger" and simplify x 100.

should've given it to me...

did you ever find a fix for this? I have the same problem - didn't realise my fees were set so low and tried to send from the wallet for the first time today. The fees are in the double digits of satoshi, which I now know is a bit on the low side. Unless the transactions go through within 24 hours I'd like to know how to pull them back.

This is very legit, I saw it live. I'm also fairly sure that the way he said "I don't know what that means" he's actually referring to bitcoin itself, not that he doesn't know why he was given the instruction. Doesn't bode well really for the credibility of the SEC.

I think you're over analysing. Up until that point I was watching the whole thing and he came across generally as a clueless buffoon. The way he pronounces "bit coins" as two seperate word is also a giveaway as is the fact that he says straight after "I don't even know what that means".

thanks for your help, but all of things you mentioned in the second paragraph are options that, as far as I am aware, are not available in multibit HD. Sorry, I don't use bitcoin-qt.
EDIT: confirmed
"Replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions
A change to Bitcoin Core in version 0.12+ involves replace-by-fee transaction support. RBF is an optional extension to a standard Bitcoin transaction that permits the sender to perform a repeat broadcast of an earlier failed transaction with a higher fee attached. Typically this is to "free up" an earlier transaction that has been accepted into the network as valid but because the fee is too low is being ignored by miners. Repeating the transaction with a higher fee allows the sender to override the earlier transaction in the hope that the miners will add it to a block.
MultiBit HD does not currently support the creation of these types of transactions and relies instead on setting an appropriate fee to the transaction to ensure timely inclusion."

Thanks. Repair wallet is an option. I'll ramp up the fees and try

This reminds me of a story a shopkeeper I know well told me today.
A few weeks ago I told him (the shopkeeper) about bitcoin and how I was starting to learn about and invest in it. He was intrigued but hadn't heard of it. When I went in today, he told me that just after I was last in, someone else came in who he happened to mention bitcoin to. The guy said he had bought a bunch 8/9 years ago, which would be right at the start of BTC history when it was dirt cheap. The shopkeeper happened to mention its value today. He said the customer had forgotten about it and had no idea of the huge value increase, he apparently turned round and went straight back out the shop.
I'm guessing someone in my town just became very rich and it was partly attributed to me...

so I ended up raising the fee settings and then rebuilding my wallet. Rebuilding as in renaming the wallet data folder and restoring the wallet using wallet words. (Repair wallet does nothing).
When it restarted my original amount of BTC was back in the wallet and the transactions I'd made weren't there. Great, I thought. The transactions didn't go through and everything has reconciled. So I closed the wallet, then remembered I had to check something and re-opened it.
...at which point it decided that the BTC wasn't actually in my wallet and that it was going to attempt the transactions again. Further, the change left over from the transactions, which I should still have, is now showing as unconfirmed as well!
Honestly, multibit HD is rubbish and as soon as I get control of this situation (if I ever do?) I'm ditching it. Complete rubbish.

wait what? I thought the front page was just the globally most popular articles. I didn't realise you had to be subscribed to a sub to see it. here was me thinking that all my favourite crypto articles were making the reddit front page for all and it's just because i'm in their subs!

I use electrum and Jaxx. When sending I think electrum allows you to specify a fee at sending time based on speed, so it's more adaptable. I've never liked multibit because 1/2 times I start it I inevitably have to repair the wallet because my balance is unconfirmed...
