Enjoy the revolution :)

That was quick. Way to go SS team!
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:17:27
I think they are hiring a webmaster to revamp this. At least that's what I read on their facebook page. Hope that gets cleaned up, as it's not an attractive way to solicit new members.
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:50:34
See you then! 
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:13:52
haha. In the interviewee's defense, perhaps he meant "killed it from the continued appreciation". 
Although, we could add this to the BTC died blog. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 00:10:24
Technically we started accepting it in December 2014, however didn't publicize it much while we got the staff up to speed...and well other things were going on, but I decided to share the news with everyone, so when you come to Denver you know where to stop :)

I agree. While a lot of his knowledge on the banking world is solid, 'shallow' is the best way to describe his views on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:23:16
From my understanding, if the company is exchanging Bitcoin for goods and services, it's much different than exchanging Bitcoin for other cyrpto-like currency. That makes you an exchange or moves you into grey area that may be considered a Money Service Transmitter, talked about above. 
Full disclosure: worked for Amagi Metals, now work for Anthem Vault. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:37:59
Anthem does not accept Bitcoin right now for gold/silver (recent development). Thanks to financial guidelines and reg in the US we can't have a cryptoasset and accept Bitcoin without pissing off the powers that be. We hope to find a way around that soon.

TL;DR  King believes banks will adopt block chain technology within the next 10-15 years and between now and then there will be a bigger move to a cashless society.

Compared to their old site, believe me this is great. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:49:36
It will, but then you learn not to drink so fast.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:12:25
You'll be happy for making such a decision. I did 1.5 years ago and I absolutely LOVE it here. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:37:45
feels so good though.

I've used one before in NH, but as someone who lived in Boston for years...I'm SO surprised to see it in South Station. That's amazing!
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:20:52
Yikes. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:47:48
It was there briefly for an event. I've got a picture of me and it from last year. It's on my instagram page  :)
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:45:18
I'm more than just PR! This is me in my normal life hahaha! But, for real, thanks for sharing my videos!
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:43:53
That's relative. Their album hit  on iTunes yesterday for top selling hip-hop album and he's been around in the lime light for well over 10 years. Mayday is definitely new though.
@_date: 2014-12-01 16:49:13
Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:24:01

I recently received an email from someone named Shakil Khan trying to sell Coin Desk advertising. I checked in with a writer at CoinDesk.com and he confirmed that this was a fake account and to block them.
BitcoinJournal.net was asking Amagi Metals for $2,500 to have articles written on Huffington Post and other media sources. In their one sheet they offered broken links and had no clear examples of clients who got major news coverage. Also the images used on the page to describe their writers were google stock images. Partick McDowell was the person running BitcoinJournal.net.

I carry a large umbrella: educational videos, customer service, press, interviews with PM influentials, writing and overall company strategy. I've been in the metals world for some time now...I used to work for the movie Silver Circle that talked all about silver and the Federal Reserve. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:19:59
oh garsh...i added a nice little wink in there to let you know I was busting your chops. Continue spreading the optimism, please! 
;p &lt;--- here's another one to ensure the troll-vibe.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:13:22
Amagi Metals offers partial payments in Bitcoin. While we do not have a streamlined process, the option is there and is best taken care of over the phone.

We are so excited for the weekly giveaways and our BBF offer! Hope everyone signs up! :)

Oh man. That is terrible news. Who would let him speak? 
I've been to Dragon Con in the past, but I'm bummed to hear this. I guarantee there were better spokespeople in Atlanta. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:20:03
I'm meeting them here in Denver today at their release party!! :) I'm going to wear my Bitcoin shirt!
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:37:13
They did have 1 ozt. silver circles, but we sold out and decided not to make any more. I might have one or two I could sell you, so you can have one! :)

I have nothing more to say than I'm sorry for your loss. It pains me deeply to see something like this happen. Thank you for sharing your story to remind us all to be diligent about our bitcoin storage. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:54:33
I see that you're only speaking to the men of this subreddit, but if my silly-old woman self may say...I'm excited too!
Thanks for posting and sharing your optimism ;P
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:30:43
Thank you for posting this. Bitcoinjournal.net is also a bad player. Be on the look out for emails from high-profile bitcoin blogs who are selling advertising. I've had a few solicitations that are fraudulent. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:52:33
It happened! I even got to buy a shirt from Murs with Bitcoin. He just handed me his phone and said "Blockchain, right?"
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:42:47
This system will be full-reserve, have yearly full audits, as well as open doors for clients to visit the vault and their metal. The name Blanchard is synonymous with sound money. James U. Blanchard III, Anthem Blanchard's father, lead the activism efforts that legalized gold and his legacy continues today within Anthem Vault. 
We are happy to answer any questions - 1-855-4-AVAULT -- thanks for the feedback r/bitcoin!

If you do not select "Place Order" your payment will be received, but the order will not complete in our system. All will not be lost, but it will require some extra manual work to ensure the order is placed. 
We will have some coupon codes very soon for Bitcoin users (promotional campaign on the way!), until then do note that all orders over $5,000 always enjoy free shipping. 
Thanks for the thoughtful feedback.

Bitcoin payments are back up.
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:02:38
Let's say they change it to 10% (18% was the record with Volkkman as Fed Chair)...tax revenue most likely wouldn't cover the $1.7 trillion in interest payments. Thus US defaults.

**who's the customer?**
How every innovator should be thinking.
Great insight, thanks. Even as a non-coder it made sense and I feel a bit more updated.
Would you consider the idea of auto-payments an important use case to discuss? It's a bit of a sub-genre to CC replacements, but so many services use auto-debits and payment plans. How do we solve this?
@_date: 2014-06-10 22:14:51
Not that I talked to. Murs was all about it. He even had his Blockchain wallet ready for me to buy a shirt off of him.

Hey there! I'd be happy to donate to the local "No Kill" shelter here in Denver for you. It could be a great opportunity to have them start accepting Bitcoin donations in general :) I'm a few days from making an adoption from them too, so I'll be by soon. It's called 
*sidenote: after volunteering for some odd years in shelters and rescue leagues, a popular misconception is that the 'no kill' shelters are better than the 'kill'. Truth be told, most 'no kill' shelters also have intake limits, meaning sometimes they have to turn dogs/cats/etc away. This is when dogs are moved to a 'kill' shelter, but they are still given a fair chance for re-homing and rehibilitation. Just wanted to share. I support both, because both help find homes for animals efficiently!*
You're sweet for making this donation!

I use Keepkey and have no complaints thus far. You can also buy it with Purse on Amazon and save some btc!
@_date: 2015-11-19 19:41:26
Agreed. I'm sure it's in the works, but it'd be great to hear about what's being developed from the community. Perhaps there would be security compromises if they shared, though.

What Bruce said: There are some pretty horrific stories out there of 'local bitcoin' - styled exchanges that caused a world of hurt in civil asset forfeiture for the people running the operation. Find out money transmitter laws in the state, if there are any specific classifications of Bitcoin in your area/state, and for good measure you can always add a disclaimer to your materials saying you do not promote the use of Bitcoin for illegal items, substances, or services. 
Aside from that - being previously in the area, I think this sounds great and I could connect you to some BTC folk in the area!
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:06:33
thanks! haha

We have publicly released Episode 1: 
Episode 2 &amp; 3 are available to view via a private link if you donate 25 FRN's or BTC to the Indie Gogo Campaign (please do! :) and Episodes 4-6 are in post production. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:13:48
If you donate $50 or the equivalent in BTC you will be on our donor list to receive the DVD of Season 1 upon completion (~Summer 2014). However, this week with BTC we are giving away some scenes to BTC donors from Episode 4 which covers alternative currencies. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:26:38
it's the last day of the campaign, we have been working sun up to sundown to spread the word. I don't find this "fishy" at all. It all goes for a good cause and it'd be a fun twist in my own life, renaming my dog. (for the record, I'm not a star in the show)
