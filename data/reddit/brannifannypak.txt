After some thought, I can see where you are coming from here. The ideals that libertarians believe are similar to many core beliefs of systems that turned facist. Im not much for politics as politicians make choices based on money, votes, their own religous sentiment or public sentiment, and not data. Im going to guess you wanted bernie sanders. Free college for everyone makes total sense ��.

Okay so at least you’re acknowledging taxes must pay for this. College is a waste of time for most. What should be “free” is internet, electricity” and water. All this is possible with solar energy now that we have the means to store that energy efficiently. I dont want my tax dollars going towards peoples shitty kids for college or anything for that matter. I want my tax dollars going towards “free” internet, water, and electricity. These base necessities being costless would certianly open up some cash flow to afford food for those families. Sure you could set limits on these things so phil mickleson doesnt abuse it to water his private greens or something. These would be far better uses of tax dollars than “free” college for everyone... I know too many people who wasted money on a college degree and are stuggling because of it. 
Now if bernie sanders said hed reform health care by actually fixing the problem (billing procedures and exorbent costs for procedures and such for no fucking reason) then Id be behind him. It isnt hard to figure out what costs should be... look at the rest of the developed world. For example  lol at obama care. Fake action. Doesnt fix the problems.

Sounds like you want everything for free?
