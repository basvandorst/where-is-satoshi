Please spread the word, I'm limited by the reddit's spam filter. :(

Theorical question: is it possible to build a version of bitcoin that lock some coins, say MtGox ones ? What would happen then ?

What about that ?

Several minutes is nice, but human typing randomly is much less random than you might think.

Can you explain how someone could verify that ?

It shouldn't be used from the live website, as stated on the security checklist in the frontpage. It's recommended to download the zip archive directly from Github.

Do you have a link that show this kind of js attack against the browser ?

Hi, I'm one of the authors.
Let say you follow what is recommended on the website, download the zip file and run it on a live CD. What does the web browser could do to harm you ?
The only risk I see is that the crypto is broken, but this risk is present for any kind of tool that generate wallets. WalletGenerator.net use almost the exact same code for that as the trusted bitaddress.org (only 2 values are changed for the different currencies).

Late for the party, but check  it might suit you :)

Well, ok, but what is actually signed, and how does that prove anything ?

You can try 
If you want custom, just replace the bitcoin.png in the wallet/ directory once you have downloaded the zip on github.
