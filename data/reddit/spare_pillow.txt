You have to also realize that this depression would be on a global scale... Firms in every major city in the world trades with the US and holds our investments. A world depression would be like nothing we have ever seen. The US as a whole may not even emerge as a superpower anymore. It would open the doors to militarization, and global wars.

Investment analyst here, with a degree in economics. 
I can tell you that the Fed has an incredibly good idea of what it's doing. Without the actions of the Federal Reserve after 2008, our country, and the rest of the world would be stuck in a severe depression. It was the Fed, and the Fed alone that saved the entire system from collapse. If you think that the Fed has done nothing but evil then you do not understand how the financial system works. Without the Fed there would have been no liquidity. Nearly every bank would have failed, and it would have spread to a global scale. 
You know what that would have meant for us 99 percenters? Unemployment like we haven't seen in almost a hundred years. This quote is extremely ignorant of that fact.

You do understand that over one in four jobs is connected to the housing industry. Do you also understand that we hit ten percent at the bottom of just the recession? We would be looking at a global economic collapse. 
They deserved to lose their jobs? what kind of person are you? thats horrible. How would people feed their families? I sure glad you do not have the power to make these decisions.

My argument wasn't that I don't think the system is messed up. I would love for there to be a better system that is safer for all of us. My only argument was that the Fed temporarily saved us from another depression. They put a bandaid on the system and made some important structural changes. 
The Fed cannot, however, stop corporate greed that started this all.

Why am I here? I love the thought of bitcoins, as an alternate way of holding wealth. It can easily be used as a both a confidential way of buying and selling, as well as a safehaven from other investments. 
This stuff is not theory, man. Without the Fed, all of the major firms and banks would have collapsed because they were all so interconnected (still are today). If the Fed would not have loosened liquidity the economy would have ended up 10x worse. There would be no way for any financial company to buy or sell anymore.

Thats simply not true at all... 
The financial crisis had very little to do with the Fed. Rather, it was banks who were providing subprime mortgages to people who could not afford them (greed from the banks). Since the investments were rated highly (because they believed that the housing market would never stop rising in value) many investors held massive amounts of this debt, and entire firms were built to buy and trade these debt instruments. When the bubble popped, these investments were then worth nothing.

You are correct. And I agree with you. However, that would have taken decades.

The Fed does what it can, but the Fed is tiny compared to these corporations. They really only have the SEC to help them. 
I do not entirely disagree with you here. The Fed's fix was more short to medium term without dealing with the longer term. I dont know about you, but I dont want to be here in America when that collapse happens. Id like to be on a farm where I can grow my own food and not rely on money. On a humanitarian level, I would prefer to not have another depression.

I am defending the Fed because they have done the job that they were designed to do! Which is keep a stable economy. They have done an excellent job of that. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 04:28:29
Yes! Absolutely correct. The only problem with that is everyone working for any bank, for any financial company, for anything to do with the housing market would have almost certainly lost their jobs. The FDIC would have insured deposits... but we would still have to deal with 30%+ unemployment. That takes decades to fix.

Oh man, I dont even know where to begin here. That is so incorrect. You obviously know nothing about monetary policy and macroeconomics. Low interest rates means business can borrow at a cheap rate, that means more people can be employed because businesses will expand as a result. It also forces investors to invest in economies rather than government bonds. Higher interest rates would wreck our economy right now.

We have small recessions nearly every decade. When they happen the Fed makes adjustments to bring the economy back to stable measures. Since employment is back to normal, I would say we much more stable than we were in the recession. That being said, if you take a look at the US GDP in the last 100 years I would also say our economy is very stable.

This has truth to it, but not entirely. You are correct that the "too big to fail" mentality by these large firms is troublesome. Now that these firms know that the government will bail them out, then yes, they will in theory make riskier investments. However, after the financial crisis, many things changed. The Fed imposed capital requirements for these firms so they must have more capital to cover their risky assets. The Fed also has complete access to these firms and can audit their risky investments. These new changes make it harder for firms to be able to make risky investments that cause the crisis in the first place. 
Corporate greed will always exist. My argument was only that if the Fed would have done nothing, then it is us who would still be suffering.
