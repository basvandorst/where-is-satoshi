Give me an hour or two. If it goes through, I'll PM you my address.

If the price goes up then yes. If the price goes down then no.


Which graphs?


You're welcome.


Did you just assume my religion? (somewhat, but not completely, tongue in cheek in case this wasn't clear).

Losers, not loosers. Looser is the opposite of tighter. But maybe that's what you meant, you have to be pretty loose to trade certain altcoins.

No problem. And despite what Infectedbtc said, I am indeed doing trying to do something. Transaction accelerators used with a a looping script and a very accurate clock can do  wonders. I've unstuck a few transactions this way.

Bitcoin isn't traded on the NYSE. 
People do, however, often arrive to work at 8.

This is false. I am indeed doing something. Two guesses for what.

Not just on gdax. All over the place massive buy orders are driving up the value. A thousand bucks in the past hour.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:13:34
So, buy low, sell high? 
Wish I'd thought of that. No wonder I always lose money.
I kid, I kid.

If you read through the FAQ linked on the sidebar you'll get a fair bit of information about this, including suggestions for wallets if you don't want to d/l core.

Try a transaction accelerator.
Don't pay for one, though, most of those are scams. Use a free one. But good luck, they're *busy*, and often limit themselves to 100 / hour. So if you don't click submit within two seconds after the top of the hour it won't work. Be ready.

Buy thousands of bitcoins. The price will move up.

- Find Satoshi. He's likely hiding in a cave somewhere near Luke Skywalker. 
- Once you find him, let him know his amazing invention has succeeded, and Bitcoin is all the way up to $1 per coin! 
- Give him $100, and in return receive 100 BTC from him via paper wallet. 
- Profit.

Try a transaction accelerator.
Don't pay for one, use one of the free ones. But their limits are often significant. Like a 100 / hour, which literally get used up within ten seconds after the top of the hour, so you have to be ready with your mouse finger at the top of the hour.

Personally, I'm pretty sure it'll go up, or down, or remain the same, sometime in the short, medium, or long-term.

Personally, if I could go back in time I would've bought bitcoin at $0.10/BTC.

Absolutely! Provided the price rises from here.
No! Not at all! Provided the price drops like a rock.
Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which of these will happen.
I wish you luck on your mission.

People do the same with other currencies all the time. That's the whole point of the Forex market.

Reason 1:
More buying than selling.
Reasons 2-5:
See reason one.

Coins other than your main currency (usually bitcoin or ethereum) that you bought intending to sell once the price rose, but instead the price continued to go down, and thus you still have the coins awaiting the price to go up again so you can sell at a profit.
That bunch of coins you're stuck with is called a 'bag' of coins. The term isn't exclusive to Profit Trailer.
