Would it cause any drastic problems to change the on-chain protocol to have more decimal places?
@_date: 2019-07-06 14:29:27
Makes sense, thanks :)
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:31:02
Thank you, this is very clear. In short, transactions are not "consolidated" until a downstream transaction is made from the upstream inputs? I made the mistake of thinking they were already consolidated at the address.
@_date: 2019-07-06 14:30:30
Also makes sense, thanks :)

2nd point : Instead of actually using NiceHash then, let's just say their rate is a good approximation of the cost of hashpower if I was to mine with this much power myself?

@_date: 2019-07-31 04:02:23
So do you know if my calculations are correct?
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:43:47
Only if the receiver trusted a single confirmation. I assume they waited for more.
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:28:23
I think my misconception must be based on how I think about addresses. What you're saying is that only TXs are stored on the blockchain, not addresses. So my intuition is telling me that all those incoming TXs are already "consolidated" at the address. But in reality they actually remain separate inputs that need to be consolidated into the outgoing TX?
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:15:02
I made a couple of edits to try to clarify, thanks :)
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:08:29
Perhaps I mean "reversible" or "doublespend"? See here : 
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:34:38
@_date: 2019-07-16 10:19:39
It's the same in the UK :(
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:42:00
I'm just asking if the maths checks out? And I don't think what you've said makes sense anyway as I'm pretty sure this kind of attack can only be used to reverse your own TXs, not somebody else's?
@_date: 2019-07-31 00:26:51
Sorry if it wasn't clear but you missed the "k" at the end of my "$50k" :)
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:32:22
Thanks, and more inputs require more bytes?
@_date: 2019-07-31 00:24:54
I don't think this is true. I think with less than 50% of the hashpower there is still a chance that you can mine a self-generated invalid transaction in order to reverse/double-spend the BTC later? Please see the second paragraph of the link I sent you. It just becomes exponentially harder to keep giving the same invalid TX further confirmations? I don't understand the exact details which is why I'm asking here, but I'm pretty sure a single confirmation isn't 100% attack proof to anything less than a 51% attack, otherwise almost everyone could rely on one confirmation...?
Edit : I was talking about $50,000/day but obviously that's still way less than 50% of the hashpower.
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:40:44
Sorry, are the units in bytes, so is the blocksize around 1.2Mb? And how does this fit with the supposed 1Mb blocksize limit?
Roughly what bandwidth does your node use? And what affect would increasing blocksize have on this?
Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:36:03
Great thank you. I think I've been reading too many news stories rather than getting involved in forum discussions with people who know what they're talking about. Media articles still often refers to the 1MB limit!
So do you have any idea about the proportional change in bandwidth and RAM usage as block size changes? Is it a linear relationship?
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:12:31
Great, yes this all makes sense now. I think it's really helped my understanding and hopefully I'll be able to educate others too as lots of people are showing more and more interest in how bitcoin works. Genuinely thanks a lot for the time you've put into explaining this :)
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:42:24
Thanks, do you have any idea how much bandwidth an average node uses? Or perhaps there is something online showing the bandwidth being used by each node? And would an increase in blocksize proportionally increase this bandwidth usage?
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:53:59
Thanks. At the moment I just want to understand what the issues with increasing blocksize are rather than debating the whole scaleability argument.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:22:56
Yeah, did the price hit 0.1 in 2010 because that's what the graph suggests? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:15:23
Thank you for your reply and sorry for my delayed response. Just to clarify, mining cost increases with competition due to reward sharing or difficulty increase or both?
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:45:04
I'm reading around 200Gb upload and 20Gb download, so I see what you mean about reaching caps. So would blocksize affect this proportionally?
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:21:14
Thanks, that makes things a lot clearer :)
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:39:46
Great explanation, thank you. So if other solutions prove effective could there be an argument for *reducing* block size, as someone else mentioned above?
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:21:39
Thanks, yes, for some reason I thought it was higher but I can see you're right now :)
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:54:49
Perfect, thanks :)
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:12:30


Sorry, I appreciate that this assumption is wrong but why so based on what's been said so far:


So if number of users doubles, network usage doubles, bandwidth/RAM requirements double, so the number of miners required to keep the network running doubles?


Sorry once again, I realise that I'm taking a very user-centric (as opposed to miner-centric) view on this but around 21st Dec 2017 network usage was so high that, while TX were effectively processed at the same rate as usual, the fees were so high that from a user perspective confirmation time dramatically increased per BTC spent?


Surely this is a balance? High difficulty secures the network but it also increases the overall cost to everyone? And I guess the equilibrium I then refer to is about finding this balance that makes bitcoin both usable for users and profitable for miners?


Yes, as with all your posts you have answered all my queries and given a great summary at the end. This paragraph makes the most important point and has definitely improved the way I think about bitcoin and clarifies my thinking on the equilibrium I'm thinking about.


So by this final sentence do you mean that bitcoin should be designed so that it makes sense for regular bitcoin savers/transactors/users to run their own nodes? Or just that they should be able to afford to pay miners to run them?
Thanks for all the time you've put into your explanations, hopefully it helps other people too :)
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:59:35
Again, thank you for such specific answers. Sorry though, as this brings up a whole heap of new questions not directly related to block size…
Doesn't this mean (assuming roughly the same proportion of bandwidth &amp; RAM per miner) that if the number of miners increases in the same proportion to the number of users that the system will scale effectively?
So when we had lots of new people getting involved at the end of 2017 and the network slowed down, isn't this just because there were not enough miners? And with the increased load causing an increase in TX fees, doesn't this increase the incentive for more miners (even if there may be a significant lag before the number of miners catches up)?
Or is the issue that if more miners keep mining when the network is no longer busy that the difficulty increases accordingly which is not good for anyone...?
I guess what I’m seeing is the potential for a kind of equilibrium being reached where it’s only economical for a certain proportion of miners to mine when the TX fees are high (part-time miners, as it were). This way difficulty does not increase unnecessarily when network usage is low (the part-time miners *are not* mining), but also that fees do not increase excessively when network usage is high (the part-time miners *are* mining). Does this make sense or am I still misunderstanding things?
Further thought… Or is it more that my suggested increase in miners then results in each miner having to share data with more other miners so that the indirect effect of more users is ultimately a quadratic (or non-linear/exponential) increase in bandwidth/Ram usage?
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:18:14
Thanks, I had got the impression that 6k USD was as cheap as it gets but now I've done more research I see that you are right that there is a huge variation in costs around the world!
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:38:17
Thanks, I have been doing a fair amount of reading but these questions are the points I've reached where I need to actually discuss things with people to further my understanding clearly. I didn't realise that my questions came anywhere close to trolling, sorry.
So roughly how many other nodes does each node interact with? Or is this entirely determined by the bandwidth available to each one?
And regarding RAM, would increasing the blocksize increase the RAM requirement?
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:29:22
Haha, I meant permanently even once sober. This happened to me once with a PIN number I'd used for years!

@_date: 2019-03-03 15:32:29

Can't we make it standard practise on here for the puzzle maker to always send a specified amount of BTC from the prize address? 0.00011111 BTC for example. At least then we know they know the privkey and didn't just find a random address full of BTC. It doesn't guarantee the puzzle links to the privkey of course...

Google "bitcoin bug" 
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:58:05
This is the primary issue with Bisq in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:17:57
Here's the goal: Someone sends BTC to my address. I pay them fiat when the TX hits 3 confirmations. I don't want to keep refreshing a block explorer waiting for the 3 confs. I also want to pay them a soon it gets the 3 confs (e.g. can't just leave it until the next day). So I want to get a notification as soon as any incoming TX hits 3 confs.
An additional use would be for my exchange deposit addresses. Fexample, I can trade my BTC on Bittrex as soon as the TX gets 2 confs and I usually want to trade it ASAP. Therefore the same as above but where I can specify the conf number would be ideal. Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-08-13 04:01:54
Thanks, yes, I assume we would hear about it if it happened. Unless it was a really dodgy trade! Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:16:00
Is gold staying at 1k because it's still being mined and hence inflating itself?

Thanks, any you know of that give notifications for a specified number of confirmations?
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:43:11
Hmm, pretty sure ShapeShift never accepted my bitcoin with zeroconf when I used to use them!
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:13:17
But a physical "coin" isn't divisible and so I think it's probably the name that's causing this issue. I also wasn't sure how it worked when I first got involved. I remember buying 1 DASH before any BTC because I could buy a whole one and wasn't sure for BTC. I agree it seems silly now!

@_date: 2019-08-17 07:06:24
I agree that Monero's privacy features make it a very interesting alternative to bitcoin. But I think people are trying to overcome bitcoin's transaction limits with things like the lighting network. In the situation I described I don't think people would be making actual bitcoin transactions with every exchange. They would use something like the lightning network or a third party exchange system that doesn't directly exchange them, just switches BTC for fiat in your account.
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:51:31
Thanks, any idea what this tool is calculating then? 
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:11:13

Oh yeah, but also mixed up the tons.
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:49:53
@_date: 2019-08-12 22:25:18
Thanks, that all makes sense. Someone else mentioned that if bitcoin became the primary global currency, a nation or wealthy entity could build a secret mining farm to match the existing network, and then attack the network without anyone knowing the origin of the attack. I think it fairly impractical in terms of cost and hardware but I wasn't sure if they could hide their location in such a case.
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:55:16
Thanks. Is it possible for the people who run the pools to know how decentralised their pool's hashpower is? I.e. Whether it comes from many different sources or a few sources etc? If so couldn't they make such information public (without naming names necessarily) making for a much clearer picture?
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:14:37
These console wars are so stupid. We all know Nintendo are the best ��

Thanks, for my first paragraph it's not for any website, it's for personal trades.
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:32:00
Thanks again. Regarding the covert attack, the motivation someone was discussing with me was to destroy bitcoin by undermining people's trust if it became the global currency. So the possibility of a hard fork doesn't necessarily mitigate that kind of destruction.
Is there evidence of &lt;50% hashrate double spend attacks occurring more recently than 2013?
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:50:07
Thanks, sorry I missed your reply. This is really interesting information and I'm glad it's so simple to work out. So for 50k USD there's roughly a 50% chance of a double spend attack working after 1 confirmation? So this suggests that, although I agree it would be stupid to do so, it should actually be pretty safe to rely on 1 confirmation for trades of around 1 BTC? And 2 confirmations for significantly larger sums?
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:51:46
No worries! :D
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:36:02
Sure. And they can even hard fork to break down satoshis further if necessary.
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:30:54
Thanks, yes, I guess my point boils down to individuals vs government. Perhaps the majority of individuals will want to store their wealth in bitcoin even though this is not good for the economy. Governments can do little to control this, so will the short-term choices of the individuals kill the economy? Or is the bigger picture that the majority of people don't own the majority of the wealth, and the wealthy will keep their wealth in government-controlled currencies? My real question is, what will happen if the majority converts all their wealth into bitcoin because they can buy more with it later on?
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:09:31
Thank you for your detailed response. I have a few further questions if you or anyone else has time to answer them.


Although it would incur greater energy costs, couldn't they pull off this process slowly to avoid suspicion? And then attack at the end of a longer private mining period?
Next, if such an attack occurred, would there be any evidence on the block explorers? Or would refreshing the page suddenly just show the new history with the old one disappeared? Would the attack be obvious to other miners? 
Finally, I have read that the reason 1 confirmation is less secure is that with less than 50% hashrate there is still a (probabilistic) chance of releasing a privately mined block successfully. So it is possible for someone with large mining capacity to perform a double spend if their trade partner was stupid enough to only rely on a single confirmation for a large amount of BTC. Is this true? (there's a website that gives the probability of this happening based on the proportion of the network hashrate used) Is there any evidence of this ever happening already? If it did happen would anyone know other than the victim, for whom the TX has suddenly disappeared from the block explorer?
@_date: 2019-08-13 04:10:19
Surely zeroconf was obviously going to be exploited from the outset? Isn't it pretty trivial to create a transaction that will never be validated? I don't understand how the developers overlooked this. It's as if they assumed confirmations served no purpose...
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:20:40
Thanks. I just don't understand why people aren't more interested in this. Isn't it one of the best measures of the security and success of the network? We've got 33% of the network operated by Bitmain (BTC.com &amp; AntPool) and from previous discussions on here it seems nobody knows whether this is 100% distributed between individual miners or 100% under the direct control of Bitmain? Add in F2Pool, Poolin and BTC. TOP and we've got 65% of the network operated by Chinese entities that, as above, we appear to have no idea of the decentralisation within this 65% and of the connections/cooperation between these four entities. How do we know, *for certain*, that over 50% isn't under the control of one group within this 65%? I've been attacked on here for raising this before but I don't understand why people interested in the success and security of bitcoin aren't more interested in more transparency in this regard? And if asking this question seems paranoid (what I've been called before) isn't it something we should all be paranoid about?
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:11:41

What was this, please?
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:47:07
I'm confused. Does RBF allow you to change anything other than the fee, such as amount or recipient?
@_date: 2019-10-21 14:10:45
I'd be interested if you could find the original quote. This is something I learnt a long time ago as I grew up loving science "news" but the more science I learnt the more I started criticising the news, until I realised that all news is pretty much bullshit... I don't get why other people don't follow this logic though, as most people are an expert at something and also complain about the inaccuracies related to their expertise...
Edit : Someone mentioned this further down - Gell-Mann amnesia effect
@_date: 2019-08-13 08:26:54
Great info thanks. Is the last bit because a very low fee can get rejected, and RBF would let them replace a suitable fee with a very low one?
How often do you get simultaneous blocks?

Gold is over $48m per metric ton. I think you're mixing up your tons and tonnes! I did round all my numbers but I shouldn't be out by a much as a factor of 7. Let me know if you think that was the issue?
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:42:01
Thanks. I have a very poor understanding of economics so bear with me... From my perspective as a consumer, I'd want to hoard my bitcoin like you say, but I also need food etc. I'd still keep my money in bitcoin over fiat because it's deflationary, but I'd have to exchange it to survive too. So, is your point basically that governments want a semi-"crappy" currency so that people are more willing to part with it? And that's what keeps the economy flowing and growing, as it were?
If this is the case, won't consumers still choose bitcoin (if allowed to do so), and then this will result in a weaker economy in the future? As we know, people don't make personal choices based on their large-scale future effects? Individuals don't care about the collective. So successful economies would be the ones that ban vendors from accepting bitcoin (or equivalents)? But I still don't see that working, people would just exchange bitcoin to fiat immediately prior to purchase? And it's pretty tough for governments to control that kind of thing.
Feel free to rip apart anything that doesn't make sense there!
@_date: 2019-08-11 10:07:03
Okay thanks :)
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:12:43
My question is more of an economic one though. What would happen if a deflationary cryptocurrency could cope with this situation and it became the most popular way of keeping wealth?
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:26:34
I travelled through rural China around 12 years ago and I'm pretty sure the major banks had ATMs that accepted my UK Visa debit card. Bank of China definitely. Same more recently too. When I say rural I mean, yes, there are places without ATMs or banks, but when they had them they worked for me...?
Edit : The bigger issue now is actually being able to spend your cash in China because they're almost entirely cashless everywhere.
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:56:01
Sorry for the large delay in seeing your response. Thanks. Yes, I guess I was envisioning this as a scam pulled off by existing miners (with over 50k USD hashrate) as a means of additional (while unethical) income. If they could gain people's trust through private trades and then try to convince one to rely on a single confirmation for a 100k USD trade then use this attack method? I'm not saying it does happen but could it?
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:49:21
Yes, I used 0.003 for 0.3%. This post explains the calculations better than I did : 
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:59:47
Okay thanks :)
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:05:16
Here's an analogy I just thought of. Before the internet governments had near absolute control over the information the population were exposed to through TV and radio. This must have kept nations more stable if managed properly. The consumers have since chosen the internet for selfish reasons (more choice, more interesting etc) and in doing so weakened government control over what information they get, and arguably weakened the stability of the nation. Nations like China have kept closer control, and this must help maintain stability.
Bitcoin seems similar. Consumers may choose it due to the benefits it brings them directly, even if there are indirect future negative consequences for the nation as a whole. Governments have had to adapt their media control to the internet, will they have to adapt their economics to work with the deflationary cryptocurrencies chosen by the population?
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:25:35
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:12:55
Oh, so the total spent amount is constant but more can be shifted into the fee? I didn't know the recipient could be changed, that's pretty important! Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:58:24
So the SatoshiDice scammers were large scale miners? But I think the maths checks out that 0.3% hashrate can give you over 50% chance of attacking a single confirmation, as it were? See the top comment.
@_date: 2019-08-10 04:36:50
What are your thoughts on my comment here? Do we know for certain that an attack on BTC isn't possible too? Or, phrased slightly differently, can we be sure that BTC isn't unacceptably centralised? 
@_date: 2019-08-10 22:00:59
Also if it's an exchange with KYC then the address I'm monitoring is hardly private anyway! :)

In an apocalyptic survival situation gold would probably be the first thing to reestablish itself as a store of value though? You might be able to trade shavings of your gold for food and weapons etc. Assuming you make it that long of course!
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:58:48
200k tonnes of gold mined at $50k per kilo is roughly $10t of gold in existence. Bitcoin's market cap has been around $50b-300b for the last two years. Which means...
**For over two years the total value of bitcoin has been between 0.5% and 3% of the total value of all the gold ever mined.**
That sounds pretty impressive, does my maths add up?
@_date: 2019-08-13 02:06:49


Is this when they release a longer chain that overrides the existing blockchain with their own version of the transaction history?

@_date: 2019-08-14 13:45:20
Very interesting, thanks :)
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:41:07
I wrote this a while ago. Does it look roughly correct? (I just noticed that others have replied and I missed them somehow so I'll check those now)
Basically I wanted to get a rough idea of how much a 1 conf double spend attack would cost. And 2 confs etc. It looks like it would cost over 10k USD for any reasonable chance of a 1 conf attack, meaning that it's unlikely anyone would double spend anything under a 1 BTC trade using this method? So, although inadvisable, we should be able to rely on 1 conf for trades under 1 BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:50:59
Ah, probably a good thing, ShapeShift with zeroconf would have been a disaster!
@_date: 2019-08-12 09:50:47
If everyone agrees it's of benefit and with no risk I think it would go ahead. I guess slightly larger transaction size would be the issue though...
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:56:51
Thanks, yes, your detailed breakdown explains exactly what I was imagining and, like you say, makes it look pretty ridiculous. Another user (I think, I'm getting confused whom I'm replying to) said that the greatest risk of 1-conf is that reorgs can happen when blocks get mined simultaneously? So 2+ confs is highly recommended, but not because of anyone with bad intentions.
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:12:40
True although I think that argument had good points on both sides whereas I don't see much against some extra decimal places, but I could be wrong. If 1 sat becomes worth like more than an hours wage it would be pretty essential.
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:33:29
Thanks but that's not the issue. I put in an address that's definitely been at zero for at least a day (on the blockchain, not some exchange interface) and it's showing I have 0.3 BTC. That would be nice if true :)

Yes, a typical altcoin, a bitcoin clone, except with investors with unprecedented wealth and power. Imagine litecoin's 20 biggest holders were the top 10 GDP countries plus the top 10 largest corporations. Imagine the connections and marketing power litecoin would then have to convince payment systems to adopt it and users to buy it and pay with it. Are you honestly saying that this wouldn't be way more successful than litecoin? Surely it would no longer be a typical altcoin/shitcoin. It's backing would have consumer trust and marketing power many orders of magnitude greater than any existing altcoin. My question is, couldn't such powerful backing make this coin overtake bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-06-19 06:00:59
Thanks, yes, this makes sense. But I think by its very nature (the difficulty adjustment system) mining is highly competitive. We're talking about a 50% reduction in turnover. So unless you're suggesting miners are making 100%+ profit then the halving will put all miners into loss. Alternatively if the price of BTC doubles this will keep things as they are. Assuming BTC price does not double then many miners will be forced to retire by the reduction in turnover. I think based on what another user has said this is more likely to lead to a reduction in hashpower (due to miners retirement) than an increase in fees?

Thanks, that's a very good point about the "balancing act" of control sales. Do you feel like corps/govs just gradually buying into bitcoin and mining is more plausible?
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:45:59
Yes, but not by enough to encourage the same number of miners to start mining again. Difficulty adjustment maintains hashpower when other factors remain constant, but it can't act to maintain hashpower when the reward has been halved, surely?
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:31:04
It looks like transactions per block are increasing at around 200-500 per year, but I'm assuming this will be (or is already) limited by block size? The increase in fees per transaction over time is hard to extrapolate because of all the congestion the last couple of years causing lots of spikes. I guess fees will have to increase as a byproduct of maintaining miner profitably due to the halvenings? How would you go about extrapolating total miner fees received per block over time?
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:24:28
Great, thank you.
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:45:13
See my other reply. It halves the reward, which will turn all miner profit into loss unless fees increase.
(Edit: Or BTC value increases enough)
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:22:44
No, you're missing the point. The majority of people trust established institutions with power and wealth. You don't have to work for Honda to choose a Honda over a brand you've never heard of.
@_date: 2019-06-17 12:00:56
Thanks for this. So the holders hold out, possibly with a restricted ability to make transactions, until the miners give in and switch to the hodlers' fork? But the threat of this should be enough to stop it happening in the first place?
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:07:32
Maybe. I always thought the smaller a business, the less resilient to hardship. That's why super-corporations are taking over all the family businesses...? Also I was discussing decentralisation in another post. As far as I can tell we have no public data on how much of the big pools' hashpower is decentralised? E.g. I think Bitmain's pools make up ~30% of the hashpower of the network and we have no idea what proportion of that comes from farms under Bitmain's influence versus individual miners contributing to the pool?
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:37:18
Yes, but if you want your TX to be processed in a reasonable amount of time you need to pay a competitive fee. I'm pretty sure either more transactions (per time) or a reduction in money hashpower indirectly leads to an increase in "practical" fees, regardless of what fee you want to pay. Perhaps I should make that point clearer. Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:37:31

@_date: 2019-08-15 04:21:36
Doesn't bitcoin allow for something a bit different to happen though. I'm thinking it allows for more of a "bottom up" process whereby individuals will choose bitcoin because it's deflationary. Then vendors will succeed by making it a payment option. I'm not saying this will end with a stable economy, but historically the government/leaders have chosen the way currency works (top down control) and everyone else has had no choice? What do you think?
@_date: 2019-06-17 07:28:08
Thanks. I could be wrong about this. Do you know what hashpower is controlled by the largest single entities such as Bitmain and Bitfury? In my hypothetical scenario I said that each "backer" might control around 1% of the hashpower. Blockchain.com appears to show Bitfury as controlling 5%?
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:20:17
Information on Bitmain's website is not evidence about what Bitmain is really doing. Here's a website saying that we have no idea how much of that hashpower is under Bitmain's direct control : 
Now we have two totally unreliable websites saying opposite things, neither of which count as evidence. So I guess the answer to this is that neither of us have any idea, perhaps nobody outside of Bitmain knows. But I still don't understand why you're so sure that none of these massive mining farms produce a significant cut of the hashpower when compared with individual users? Where's your data coming from to reach that conclusion?
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:26:32
Good point. Isn't that quite likely to be the case?
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:26:31
Thanks. My new understanding is that this will not cause fees to increase but that, without an increase in BTC value, miner profits will decrease, leading to some miner retirement, a reduction in hashpower, and a minor reduction in network security?
@_date: 2019-08-11 04:06:02
Thanks, but this seems to give an incorrect balance for my address (doesn't match blockchain) and I can't see any alert/notification options? Or does it just notify me of transactions itself?
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:43:37
Okay so Bitmain owns the BTC.com and AntPool pools, which currently contribute to 32.5% of bitcoin's hashpower. Do you have any evidence as to how much of that hashpower is contributed by individuals such as yourself versus mining farms under direct or indirect control of Bitmain? How are you so sure that they don't control 30% of the network?
@_date: 2019-06-17 07:40:53
But Bitfury controlling 5% of the hashpower is even more centralised than the situation I described, isn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:58:13
Ah, yes, so if half the miners retire they each double their chance of solving a block so their effective reward per time would remain the same? So the halvening means hashpower will decrease if BTC value doesn't increase? So we need an increasing value with each halvening to maintain network security?
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:25:57
Thanks, so you're saying that even though bitcoin is tied to quite a centralised system, their only motivation is the success of bitcoin itself?
I guess I would worry that the miners/whales/devs might face more pressure to form ties to other corps/govs as bitcoin gains popularity?
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:12:35
With bitcoin core, do you know where the entropy/randomness comes from in order to generate truly random keypairs?
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:23:28
Thanks for this. I'm still seeing things quite differently though.


Wouldn't a 50% reduction in turnover cause *all * miners to go into loss? Unless some miners are making over 100% profit which seems extremely unlikely? 


I didn't say that. I said that to keep a constant hashpower (through each halving) the price is required to increase (double I think). That's a negative rather than a positive, isn't it? 
Let me try to explain what I see happening more clearly:
Half the reward means half the turnover. This will put all miners into loss. Many will stop mining, at least temporarily. Some will continue because they know they need the network to keep functioning to maintain their livelihood in the longterm. Difficulty will drop accordingly. This will make mining profitable again for *some* miners, but how many is hard to tell. Wouldn't it be close to half the hashpower? If we strip away everything then effectively the reward per time has halved, so we need half the number of miners (half the hashpower, anyway) to double the chances of each miner getting the new half-reward and make the same profit as before?
So what's stopping half the reward resulting in half the hashpower? This can be counteracted by a doubling in price, of course, which could happen.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:57:28
Thanks, but sometimes we might choose to let convenience trump privacy.
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:37:23

@_date: 2019-06-18 00:54:59
Good point, thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-18 02:27:15
I see, that also makes a lot of sense. When do you think the power of hodlers/transactors will become equivalent? I guess when the fee curve crosses the reward curve. Have fee increases been fairly steady when you iron out the spikes? I can take a look myself when I get a chance. Thanks for an the info, it's really boosted my understanding.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:28:17
Thanks, yes, and the halving could lead to such price gains that their profits could actually increase. We'll just have to wait and see I guess!
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:35:31
Perfect, thank you.
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:55:48
Sure, but the halving must have some kind of significant impact as this is the main source of income for miners. I agree that if the BTC price (or at least it's purchasing power with regards to mining costs?) doubles then that will mean that miners make the same amount of profit. But if the price does not double then mining is (much) less profitable (a halving of turnover will likely put all miners into loss) so this forces miners to retire which surely reduces hashpower and hence reduces network security? I agree that if all things remain equal then the difficulty adjustments will keep hashpower fairly constant (if miners retire then mining adjusts to become more profitable encouraging more miners) but the halving of the  reward is directly linked to their income and its effect is surely "external" to this negative feedback system?
In short, if price does not double then won't the halving certainly cause a reduction in hashpower and security?
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:43:48
How are miners going to keep making profit if their reward is halved, the number of TXs per block stays the same, and nobody increases their TX fees? Mining will have to reduce in hashpower until the fees become competitive enough for miners to profit again.
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:09:00
Yes, that all sounds right, but overall there would be a reduction in hashpower, and the higher the hashpower is the safer the network is from various attacks? So maintaining network security (at its current level) is somewhat dependent on the BTC price rising with the halving to maintain miner profits?
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:20:10
Thanks. So we have an "excess" of security as it were. How much of the hashpower do you think would need to be cut before an attack became a genuine possibility?
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:20:46
I'm pretty confused, what do you mean by economically-significant wallets? I thought miners could decide which transactions to verify, and whoever solves the block, it's the TXs in that block that get permanently verified?
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:08:55
You have a confusing perspective. We both agree that we shouldn't be trusting the motives of large corporations and governments but when I query a clear conflict of interest on a bitcoin mining company's website you call me paranoid. You believe that only a tiny proportion of the 32% is under Bitmain's control without any evidence at all? What percentage are you saying they control and where does that figure come from? How is it paranoid of me to query this?
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:05:30
Thanks, yes, this is the answer I'm looking for. So you're saying we couldn't get enough entities to work together on something to make it seem unbiased for anyone else. If it involved a thousand entities then maybe others would trust it as being in no one group's favour, but that kind of cooperation is totally impractical?
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:59:05
Thanks, yes, I get all that, that's why I own bitcoin. But if you read what I'm describing it's more akin to bitcoin than to fiat. In fact, it's identical to bitcoin just with a different group of people doing the mining and holding a significant proportion of the coins. So everything you're saying is good about bitcoin is good about the currency I'm suggesting. The main difference is that the coin I suggest would be adopted faster because the people who benefit from this adoption have more power to directly increase the adoption themselves. If you are suggesting that they might play the system unfairly and mess everything up as has happened with fiat, then what's to stop the current bitcoin whales/miners from doing the same thing?
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:31:34
Thanks, but I'm not talking about pools. What hashpower do Bitfury and Bitmain control directly, as in, is being produced by their own mining farms? Try to see the point I'm trying to make. You're saying that bitcoin is highly decentralised, so tell me what is the largest amount of hashpower controlled by a single entity? I appreciate that both of us control tiny amounts of its hashpower, but that's not relevant if someone else controls too much. You say consensus is not determined by miners, but you haven't said who it is determined by...? Please help me understand your point of view.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:31:00
So I guess you're saying that the time-tested success of BTC so far outweighs any advantage such influential "backing" might bring to a future cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:08:43
But this is self-chosen anonymity so for all we know many might already have made significant ties. My point there was that they are not known to the public, but they could be well-known to people who want influence. And regarding censorship resistance, it's either a censorship resistant system where someone with power owns 1%, or one where they don't, so surely they'll push for the former. I'm not saying they want their 1% to be able to censor things, just to have 1% of the wealth. But again, it might be easier for them just to buy 1% of BTC perhaps?
@_date: 2019-06-17 07:18:00
Perhaps the word "backed" was not a good choice on my part. If you read my description I said that a proportion of the coins is owned by the corporations, as is a proportion of the hashpower. The network protocols are the same as bitcoin and miners (by consensus) can take the coin in any direction. As I keep saying, the system is identical to bitcoin just with different people involved. Bitcoin also has a significant proportion of coins and hashpower owned by just a few individuals/entities. I'm not sure how I can explain it more clearly. Try reading some of the other responses as they seem to understand the point I'm making.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:54:34
I guess my point is, I think around 50% of bitcoin's hashpower is controlled by three entities. Wouldn't 20 corporations/nations be even more decentralised? And their motives/connections, while not transparent, might be easier to predict too.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:05:38
Thanks. I've had more time to think about what you've said and it seems obvious now! It's the miner fees that drive everything, right? So it's the people moving the most BTC around and who are willing to pay the most in fees who have the most influence? This influence costs them money which means everybody is only going to pay for genuine transactions that they need to make. So it's the people actually using BTC as a payment system who have the power, not the miners and not the whales. Does that sound correct?
Do we know which single entities are responsible for spending the most on TX fees and therefore have the most influence in this sense? The biggest exchanges when people make withdrawals perhaps?
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:16:09
True, but that argument only makes sense generally and when you have not specified whether she likes flowers or not. The details of my description explain why the "backing" can lead to more success than no backing. Currently we have bitcoin with no backing, and I'm talking about bitcoin with backing. The level of details involved is the same as clearly bitcoin is not currently backed by any major powers, so your Sally analogy doesn't really apply. I am willing to accept that the major powers may go with bitcoin, instead of creating a be currency, if that's what you're suggesting?

I agree that the network is very secure but doesn't greater hashpower reduce the chance of certain attacks?
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:40:46
Thanks, but I guess what I'm saying is that the "backers" in my scenario are just the equivalent of the current bitcoin whales and miners? They hold the same power and influence, it's just in my scenario they're there by design, whereas with bitcoin it came about more organically. But are the end results any different in terms of turning backs and getting ripped off?
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:48:02
Thanks, yes, others are echoing this. What percentage drop in hashpower do you think would actually put bitcoin in any kind of real risk?
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:53:38
I think it's because doing that would destroy all trust in bitcoin and its value would plummet. That would never be in the advantage of the majority.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:52:22
Well, in this sense, slow adoption is the problem. Slow adoption is not immediately obvious as a problem, unless institutions with power and wealth can keep their power and wealth by using their power and wealth to create an equivalent coin with faster adoption. Do you see what I mean? And just to clarify, my description above does not involve such institutions acting as third parties, they just replace the devs/miners/whales in the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:47:22

@_date: 2019-12-03 23:51:31
True. But there are two factors to consider. Such an attack would be very expensive. And, as far as I understand it, the "majority of nodes" consensus can reject the "majority of hashpower" attacker's decision with a hard fork. Damage would be done but it wouldn't necessarily end all trust in the system.

You said "the exact same technical properties as bitcoin". There is no way such a coin would succeed as it already exists in adopted form. This means your original argument of a flaw of bitcoin is that it can be cloned is not a valid flaw.

I think your misunderstanding comes from thinking that the cost of 1 coin is relevant. 1 coin is just an arbitrary unit. If we measure bitcoin in satoshis the "cost" is 100 million times cheaper... If your argument made sense someone would have done it already. The reason they haven't is that nobody (knowledgeable) would buy it as bitcoin already exists...

For people complaining about traders having large sums of BTC on LBC. You know those traders with 200,000+ trades with automated trading systems setup so you can buy how ever much BTC you want at any time of day as quickly and efficiently as possible? Well they sell a lot of BTC. Perhaps they have a lot of BTC on LBC because they're actively trading it. That's what LBC is for.
Edit: One trader is currently selling 24 BTC. Of course it's a risk, but they're not just people too lazy or stupid to move their funds somewhere safe (as many people are inferring). They're taking a calculated risk to make good profit through trading large amounts.

@_date: 2019-09-24 14:09:02
Thanks. It would be nice to compare it directly to USD (etc) inflation all on the same graph but I guess I can find separate graphs of those easily enough :)
@_date: 2019-09-15 10:20:32
Haha yeah pretty much what I was thinking...
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:58:39
Wow thanks, lots of great strategies. Were you manually entering the seeds somewhere or could you automate it to some extent? 
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:22:44
But in the non-bitcoin cases it's much easier for someone else to get between you and your funds. Either through theft or blocking your access to them. Assuming they don't have this tin of course! Handled appropriately the bitcoin is effectively 100% secure and accessing/spending it only requires basic internet access.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:18:35
Yay, well done! Did you get the BTC? Fancy donating a small fraction of it to the next puzzle? I made one of these last year but nobody donated anything to the next puzzle so I ended up funding this one myself again...
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:41:02
Yeah. People would (illegally) keep their wealth in bitcoin and then insta-convert it to fiat via decentralised exchange apps when they want to buy something. You've raised a valid question but it's just too easy for people to use technology to circumvent a ban.
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:59:29
:) It is pretty hard. Might need to find a friend to help with the first word. For the second word I guess the number of letters is important.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:23:51
Also do you think you could give some tips on how you solved various words to give others a better chance in future?
@_date: 2019-09-24 10:57:51
Any nice graphs showing the inflation rate of BTC and fiat currencies over the last 5/10 years?
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:42:02


What do they even mean by this? And how is something inherent to it...?
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:18:45
Yes, it was :)
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:27:59
Once it's been solved it would be nice if you could share how you figured some of them out so quickly to help others develop strategies for future puzzles.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:20:04
I guess we'd need to look at the total global non-ASIC hashrate of all the altcoins to judge it properly.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:07:57
Thanks, yes, this all makes sense. Won't regulated exchanges eventually die out too? Along with fiat, so we just have crypto DEXs? 


Yes, although this still wouldn't surprise me. It's like how they banned weed almost globally with enough propaganda. They just need to blame some bad stuff on crypto and people will support a ban. Whether they could enforce it though... Probably not.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:15:54
What you just said but the other way around...
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:20:12


Can you clarify what you mean by this? I agree about everything else.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:49:50
What's guaranteeing this other than their reputation though? If they lost more funds than they could reasonably make back by staying active, would they pay out?
@_date: 2019-05-13 05:50:31
Yes, thank you for explaining this further :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:49:28
Thanks. That doesn't seem a lot if a superpower sees bitcoin as a genuine threat?
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:43:33
Okay thanks, I'll look into it :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:23:15
Thanks, yes, my understanding is limited. If a state controlled 60% of the hashpower, why would 10 confirmations help? Wouldn't roughly 6 of those confirmations be state-controlled and untrustworthy?
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:11:05
Thanks for your detailed response. Although more expensive, couldn't they attack with more general GPUs? Or can new algorithms always be made to prevent this?
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:03:45
But what about matching the current hashpower with ASICs and having a load of GPUs to then target any algo switches? They just need more ASICs and more GPUs than the crypto community. Possibly not that farfetched for a wealthy nation?
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:17:30
Thanks, yes, you've made my point more clearly than I did. So, does anything close to this exist yet? Closest yet appears to be "protected" funds on exchanges only protected so far as they'll payout no more than they need to to keep making profit... Not particularity great I think we can all agree...
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:22:09
I've repaid you for your time by increasing the value of BTC by 25% since we started this conversation. It was the least I could do :D
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:57:47
Yes, makes a lot of sense. I'm actually just trying to figure out how you sign a multisig transaction...? The signing form I'm looking at only has one private key input. Do I sign multiple times somehow, or input multiple privkeys at once?
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:21:42
Very true.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:52:02
You're overestimating people's technical ability and trust in themselves. You can't fall for such a scam without actively doing something stupid, whereas operating a trezor requires actively doing something not stupid. Think about older generations, or kids who have grown up with minimal PC experience.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:38:54
Thanks, so in a new crypto-based system, third-parties will be forced to be more competent.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:45:14
Yes, assuming you can create the private keys securely and store them somewhere safely. And I don't think many people trust themselves to do this properly (yet)... Which is why they're still going to trust the banks more than themselves. I think most people here are saying that technology that empowers non-experts to setup and keep their own keys securely will eventually outdo any kind of third-party "savings" system for bitcoin. I can see that happening with advances in identification systems etc.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:10:41
Thanks, yes, I agree with this. It looks like any kind of reasonable third-party protection just isn't possible.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:08:00
Thanks, all good points.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:52:39
Yes, so what I'm asking is, what if they didn't attack with ASICs but used GPUs instead? Or would that be insanely expensive to hit the required hashpower?
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:48:30
Thanks, could you elaborate?
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:29:30
I see. More profitable because if my chain ends up longer I've got the reward?
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:51:34
Thanks, yes, well I guess this leads to the related question of "what methods of fiat storage are the most secure?" Sorry to hear about your father's situation though... :(
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:22:50
Yeah. It feels like the network should agree on a plan of action like this. By having one it could prevent such an attack happening in the first place.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:32:14
Okay, thanks :)
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:03:32
Thank you :) Would you be able to comment on the following setup if you have time please? Use a fresh OS​ to download Electrum, go offline, create wallet and write down keypair, zero fill hard disk. Repeat the last sentence. Repeat a third time but this time use Electrum to create a 2/3 multisig wallet with the two previous master pubkeys. Distribute the 3 privkeys to safe but distant locations. Any flaws with this? Any simple ways to improve it? Before I used offline browser-based generators but I've heard the JS can give erroneous keypairs. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:48:20
I wasn't really taking about reversing transactions as I think this undermines the entire bitcoin system. More that a third-party would be forced to pay you back anything they lost. But as others have pointed out this won't work in practice on a large scale...
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:27:32
Thanks, yes, this is good information. But would you agree that the above is currently safer than keeping your wealth as BTC on an exchange? If so, what's the safest third-party BTC storage system out there?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:30:16
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:19:17
What if the attacking government used GPUs instead? Couldn't they always afford to buy/make more "regular" hardware than the "regular" miners, if they really wanted to?
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:24:57
Thanks for all the fine details. But for a country like the USA these costs, while huge, are still possible should they see crypto as a big enough threat to the dollar? Any idea how much the cost would increase if they had to build a second GPU facility to counter an algo switch response? I guess the "regular" miner hashpower would massively decrease with an algo switch though, so perhaps that's still within reason?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:02:58
But if they have more money can't they always mine faster?
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:38:16
Thanks, yes, very valid point. So we're back to the main point everyone's making, neither exchanges or banks can guarantee your funds won't be lost. But I think for a non-bitcoin expert (i.e. can't create a cold wallet) a major Western bank beats a crypto exchange which beats personal storage, in terms of current risk? Or do you disagree? This ranking could well change with future financial crises and currency collapses...
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:39:47
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:52:21
Yeah I think this is really important. Changing the algo won't work because they'll just beat you at that one too...
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:52:51
Thanks. I'm thinking longterm where people are suggesting bitcoin will challenge the dollar as the next global currency. Or allow its enemies to bypass sanctions etc. A lot of people forecast bitcoin to become a genuine threat to traditional power structures. So aren't the odds of them fighting back pretty high?
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:11:15
This is what I was thinking. The state just needs to own more ASICs and more GPUs than the crypto supporters. Which sounds relatively easy if they really wanted to...?
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:36:43
I see, also interesting, thanks for all the help :)
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:38:45
Okay thanks :)
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:59:44
Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:44:22
I see. So it's the fees that encourage the miner to fill the block with transactions? If the difficulty was too low, the TX fees were too low, and the reward was too high, then it might make sense to go for empty blocks to give you more time on the hash function? Although I guess the TX verification time is very small comparatively...? But the reason the network gets congested (TXs left unconfirmed) is that miners are going for the hash function prior to being able to verify all TX made?
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:13:29
I've just found coinb.in which looks promising. I'm confused as to how you sign a multisig transaction though... In 2/3 are 2 private keys used to sign simultaneously or does 1 sign followed by the other? coinb.in seems pretty easy to create a multisig address but I'm less clear how to move funds out of one... Thanks
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:07:02
I'm not suggesting they control bitcoin to use it, but to make it valueless so that fiat can continue to reign...
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:07:34
Yes, this too.
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:47:53
!lntipbot 100
@_date: 2019-05-22 09:59:54
Was also going to ask this. OP missed the part explaining how this happened in the first place...?
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:24:12
A friend who knows more about bitcoin than me... A company that is legally required to repay me even if they lose my bitcoin... Your argument doesn't really get my point. If nobody wanted third party protection everyone would have piles of cash and gold under their bed. I'm not talking about me or you necessarily, but few people will trust their wealth in something they don't understand, and with mass adoption you can't expect everyone to understand how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:40:59
Very well put, thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:35:30
No need to get personal. Fiat has its weaknesses, bitcoin has its weaknesses. We both agree bitcoin is better, but you jump to conclusions about my opinion just because I point out one genuine weakness...?
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:38:40
Thanks, yes, I've read similar advice since posting that!
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:41:52
Thanks. What would be the best way to create BIP compatible seeds on an offline device? Or do you recommend using a HW? Could I use a HW to create multiple keypairs by "reseting" it in between each pair, or is each device's privkey hardcoded? I'm also very interested in the metal storage you mentioned as I don't really trust hardware to last over long periods of time, especially if I wasn't periodically testing each of the 3 devices (2 could fail without me realising). Sorry for all the questions! I'm basically looking for the best option for a 2/3 multisig cold wallet that would be left alone for ages. Others say don't use offline JS keypair generators and you've advised against Electrum. I'm happy with creating offline devices (e.g. Raspberry Pis) but I don't know the best way to generate keypairs on them... Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:01:15
This would be my worry too.
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:01:34
Well, kind of. I think being beaten by the might of a world superpower doesn't mean it's not a good system, just not the ultimate system...
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:26:23
A few questions...


Can they do this completey separately to your key generation and then somehow link their key up (without access to your keys)? How does this work on simple terms? 
Do you have any recommendations for generating multisig keypairs offline? e.g. Like an offline paper wallet generator but with a multisig setup? 
Which third-parties currently provide a service such as you describe above?


Is this what Hodl Hodl and LocalEthereum use?
Thanks for all the great info :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:51:18
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:17:46
Thanks, sounds realistic.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:29:42
Yes, something like this sounds quite plausible.
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:12:17
Thanks, I'll take a look.
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:48:52
!lntip 100
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:17:26
When a miner solves a hash function and broadcasts it, do the other miners just check it's valid and then see that block as solved and move into the next one?
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:43:18
Thank you for your detailed reply. This all makes sense. What kind of mitigations and protections do you suggest?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:11:24
I think an idea that other people have reached too is that once they outcompete the bitcoin network it becomes really cheap to outcompete any of the new "hydra heads". I'm assuming the global hashrates of altcoins are much lower than bitcoin's? They just need a second GPU-based farm to attack any further contenders...
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:44:52
Hmm, that's a very good point about proof that you didn't use the keys yourself. To me that suggests that third-parties are very unlikely to store anyone's keys, just your funds with their own keys...
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:25:25
Cool, thanks for the GBP info. For your first paragraph, what options currently exist?
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:15:45
Thanks, it's all starting to make a lot more sense now. And they'll go after the TXs with the best fee/size ratio to maximise the fees they can get out of one block?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:29:54
This is a good point. They'll have to step up to compete in the new system.
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:06:14
And by what factor would their costs multiply to match the hashpower with more general miners like GPUs? Will it always be possible to make a new algo that their processors can't process effectively?
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:28:44
True. Although if the dollar is genuinely threatened...
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:07:25
Haha okay, yes, this could well be the case. Although perhaps other powerful countries are less incompetent?
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:07:20
Thanks, this makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:49:31
Got it to work eventually! 
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:03:26
Brilliant, thank you for all this. The last (hopefully) thing I still don't understand is how to create an offline multisig wallet without Electrum? Does the Trezor script let me do this? What can I use to generate the 3 seeds for the 2/3 wallet that will still be recoverable even if Electrum (or alternatives) die?
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:51:02
But better than losing control of the network?
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:24:20
Cool, thank you for the detailed reply. How did the accidental 2-block reorg happen? I don't mind if you send me a link or just say you've typed enough for today though! Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:02:58
Thanks, I'll need to have a think/read about about all this. If 2/3 multisig is even possible between 3 HWs (?) I'm assuming it's an unnecessarily expensive method for a long-term "left untouched" cold wallet? Raspberry Pis and metal storage makes more sense?
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:01:30
Okay thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:51:10
How so? Unless bitcoin supporters can match the nation's hashpower attack wouldn't the nation gain control of all BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:39:18
I just don't see how that can work. If you're a billionaire you're going to pay people to help keep some of your wealth safe, even if that's a cold wallet in a bunker with security staff. It's like saying people shouldn't rely on doctors and should just educate themselves in medicine. As you say, nobody is hackproof, but I assume they'll take out insurance and guarantee your funds that way. A fully-insured crypto cold wallet service is a lot less likely to get hacked than my mum, for example. Where do non-experts keep their wealth once fiat is dead?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:28:33
True, and I guess the software will become more and more user-friendly.
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:31:55
Thanks, yes, but an individual's bitcoin can be stolen or destroyed much more easily!
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:03:56
I think 2008 is a long time ago for most people and as long as these crises happen far enough apart they'll just be portrayed as anomalies and people will still trust the banks. If they increase in frequency/severity however (which knowledgeable people are telling me they will) then I think you're right, that's how things will change.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:29:09
Thanks. So like the banks, as long as the whole thing doesn't go belly up, these exchanges do offer a similar level of protection?
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:42:19
Banning would probably happen first. Are you saying that bitcoin will never challenge the dollar? Or that if it does challenge the dollar you don't think that it will be fought?
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:06:09
Bit of a thought experiment... If I created a 24-word seed with python-trezor and then stored 16 out of the 24 words in 3 different locations (e.g. AB, AC, BC) what kind of time-frame are we looking at for a thief to crack a wallet if they have 16/24 words? Is this equivalent to an 8-word wallet? And... If it's easily crackable, what if I shifted it so, for example, only 14 words are at each location. Now I only have to crack 2 missing words (easy?) whereas the thief has to crack 10 (significantly harder)? With such shifts I can exponentially increase the thief's difficulty while only minimally increasing mine? Does any of that make sense? What would be the optimum distribution of the 24 words...?
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:37:01
I think the problem is that a safe becomes less safe the more wealth you have and the more well known your wealth is. It also puts your personal safety at a greater risk.
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:30:55
Thank you for such detailed info. Your Raspberry Pi suggestion is pretty much what I was thinking. Without multisig there always seems to be a compromise between protection against destruction (keeping backups) and risk of theft (increased with each backup). Can I feasibly set up a multisig system using your suggested HW/metal combination?
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:34:40
Yeah, I thought about this further. Their best strategy would be ASICs and GPUs. They beat the current algo with ASICs, and then as long as their GPUs can outcompete the GPUs of the crypto supporters, they can beat bitcoin algo switches or altcoins too.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:54:20
But they can never ensure that's the case, right?
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:52:54
So is there a way to protect from such an attack?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:37:05
But they only need to outcompete everyone else. How many of the non-bitcoin ASICs are actually in use? I imagine a tiny amount in comparison? Non-PoW seems like a potential solution.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:13:30
Thanks, agreed.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:41:36
I think it's safe to assume that neither of us have referred to accurate statistical data... Firstly I accept that mindsets may change slowly over time but, baring brain wallets, a cold wallet is little different to keeping gold and (I'm fairly sure) the vast majority of people with saved wealth save it in banks via a third party rather than stashing gold somewhere?
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:53:04
So perhaps a temporary switch to PoS with an agreed return to PoW after the attack has ended?
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:19:55
This is probably a very valid point :D
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:03:50
Thanks. Would them attacking with GPUs be a more expensive but also more effective strategy? With a 51% attack can't they just "fake" transactions to steal your BTC (sorry, my understanding is weak here)? And regarding the democratic approval time, I think it depends how scared they actually get!
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:25:32
Thanks for the detailed reply. So I guess you're saying that as more banks and currencies fail, bitcoin will eventually become "safer" for the masses, despite some of its associated security risks. And by its nature it can't be fully protected so we'll just have to adapt (and the technology will adapt too). I guess a kind of iris/fingerprint/DNA unlocking system combined with tests for stress/drugs (to prevent kidnapping etc) could eventually give everyone complete and highly secure control over their wealth?
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:20:08
If you have a private key to access your funds but you lost or misrecorded a few of the characters it will try all the missing character combinations to find the correct private key. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:43:57
I suggest you stick to crypto and concern yourself less with biology...
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:05:49
Thanks once again for all the details. Do you mean that with each block, miners often start out mining an empty block (on the chance they might solve it first) but whilst they are doing this they (in parallel) start to add transactions to blocks and then try to solve them too? Once they have a block with some TXs verified, they might as well try to solve that one instead of the empty one, to get the fees too? So a relatively empty block may be solved quickly by chance, but after a few mins most miners are working to solve blocks full of TXs?
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:00:38
You're massively overestimating humanity with regards to technology. Older generations are very wary when it comes to technology. And (I'm a teacher) most teenagers have never used a USB stick before. What you're seeing as a minority who can't/shouldn't use bitcoin, I'm seeing as a majority, and that's why I see my OP as being so important in terms of mass adoption... Most people are not going to trust their life savings to a USB stick and some words on a bit of paper.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:58:14
Yes, this makes sense. But they will fight back too in a kind of arms race. What if instead of ASICs they use more general GPUs, then all they need to do is match the crypto supporters' hashpower to defeat any network? I appreciate there are lots of alternatives but couldn't they fight these too? E.g. PoS, buy the majority? I guess my point is coming down to something like... If "they" have more power than "us" don't they nearly always have more chance to "win", as it has always been? Wouldn't they start paying smart people lots of money to come up with equally good ideas to protect their interests? Thanks
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:41:50
Thanks. My thinking is that once I've tested the multisig system it's not really any more complex, it just involves storing 3 keys instead of 1, which makes it both theft and destruction resistant. But the initial multisig generation seems to be the limiting factor. I'll be honest that I am likely to split funds between various systems we've discussed to avoid eggs/basket...
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:00:50


What about just someone with more funds? Won't superpowers always have more funds than the miners?
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:53:16
Thanks, I'll take a look now.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:07:37
Sorry, yes, I misinterpreted what you said. It's okay for a third-party to "secure" your own keys, but not to "insure" them, as you said before, because you could just move the funds and then accuse them of letting your funds get hacked and claim the insurance.

Thanks, great answer! I knew about multi-sig but didn't really think about it in this way. I'll need to read this again in the morning and reply in more detail then, thanks :)
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:39:57
Ah, I see. So what you're saying is there isn't yet any agreed multisig system so it would (currently) be dependent on individual projects that could make it very hard (or impossible) to recover the funds should those projects become unavailable?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:03:32
Very good point... So any solution to this?
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:02:42
This sounds like a good solution.
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:18:43
Morality aside, hasn't firepower been the basis of economics since... Well pretty much since the first cells started trading energy a few billion years ago! So yeah, quite sound.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:47:21
Haha thanks. I like to think there's always things people are individually not very good at perceiving though... I forgot to wear shoes on a trip out the other day... :D
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:06:00
Thanks, yes. Unless they simply underestimated it back then? What do you feel are the pros for them? Or simply they saw it as a technology they could never defeat in the long run?
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:06:55
Yeah, although the global banking system is pretty powerful and will probably do what it can to get in on the action once they realise that they need to...
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:31:31
Thanks for the clarification, I was mistaken on the details.
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:50:25
Nobody else here seems to have a problem discussing the points I have raised. Are you saying that storing your own keys doesn't come with any risks? That would be ridiculous...
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:57:57
What kind of mitigations? Couldn't they use something like Tor to make their attack unidentified from other miners?
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:47:09
Your post introduced me to the !lntipbot 100
Thanks! 
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:27:27
Thanks, interesting idea :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:24:53
Yes, although it would reach the point of being cheaper for them to develop the equipment themselves.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:32:09
Yes, true, once more people realise this is now an option the mindset will change.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:10:30
Thanks. I think this helps me think about my OP more clearly. What I'm saying is then... For a non-expert who can't store BTC securely themselves, GBP in a major bank is currently more (just more, not fully) secure/protected than BTC on an exchange. So my question is, what is the most secure/protected form of third-party BTC storage currently available? And what better third-party systems do people forsee becoming available? (again, I appreciate that "bitcoin" and "third-party" are not the best of friends, but I feel this is still a practical and important question!)
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:52:10
Can you put some kind of figure on the cost? And why does it matter if the plan is public?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:26:51
I see, thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:12:53
Not everyone. Just crypto supporters. I think it would be easy for a wealthy state to outcompete them in terms of general processing power.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:50:43
A lot of people are talking about algo switching. Obviously that would be pretty disruptive for the network but might save it. I think next I'll look into the cost of matching hashpower with GPUs instead of ASICs. That would be a much more effective attack against algo switching I assume?But much more expensive?
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:00:31
Because without 51% of the hashpower they can't control it, unlike their national currency.

@_date: 2019-05-26 14:26:56
Thanks. Do you know under which legal system(s) this is protected?
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:29:12
But I can transfer that cash to a bank account, which while I agree isn't completely secure, seems more secure than the third-parties I can currently transfer my bitcoin to?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:19:37
Sorry, I'm struggling to find explanations of mining that aren't either way too simple or way too complex. Is the system designed so that a miner must verify all the transactions in a block before it can attempt to solve the hash function? Or does solving the hash function automatically verify the block's transactions somehow?
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:38:25
This is definitely a possibility. Hard to tell whether they'd fight over it or rally against it though... It goes against the interests of the most powerful, but then they'd be the most capable of gaining control of it...
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:49:59
I see, thank you, yes, this makes more sense. Hold out against the seige until they run out of resources?
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:01:27
Change algorithm?
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:36:45
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:18:06
And we know what's happened to the guys who've tried to change that over the last couple of decades...
