They do. But the guy with a truck is just ripping off the subsistence farmers because he knows they have perishable crops and no means of getting them to market.
It's a serious and classic problem in aid delivery. Even if you can get the road built you can't necessarily guarantee you're not just enabling bad guys to rip off the starving more effectively.

It really depends on where you live. I was in Northern Zambia last year, astonishing 4G network thanks to Chinese infrastructure investment, but most people are walking and cycling for up to eight hours to buy food from the markets and don't have running water or electricity at home. Men work one to four days travel away from the subsistence farms their wives run to feed the children, motorised transport is extremely rare for the majority of people not from a tribal elite background.
Phones are restricted to the few with good jobs (&lt;$100 USD per month), and even then you're talking about iPhone 3G era handsets or cheap 3G feature phones (cheap meaning a months wages). These people are so poor they are risking their lives poaching Puku with [homemade guns]( for food.
So really this means clever and already relatively well educated people with internet access and access to money. 
Edit: Heres a picture of the phones on sale in [Serenje](  bear in mind the prices are in Kwacha, 1000 kw = $105 USD and the best paid workers at the national parks in the area earn around $90 USD a month.
This is a Puku:

They're one of a billion species of antelope. Grass feeders, so they do taste great.

I couldn't believe it, that's why I took so many photos. The anti-poaching patrol showed me their lone gun (one gun for 6 men). I thought it was an AK74 at a distance, nope, it was an actual AK47. 
Here are the posts I made about them at the time:-
