Holy shit this is amazing. You should really contact the team at Bounty0x. They are planning on initiating crowd funded bounties soon and I think you would be the perfect person to be the face
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:51:21
Did you read the post?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:38:30
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:34:01
Where do you see that? That still seems pretty high
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:33:52
I want one
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:20:02
Do they charge higher fees with a debit card?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:47:48
That was just allowing people to withdraw the BCH they got from the fork. They won’t let people buy it on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:59
What makes you think that? Do you think they want it to fail? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:47:53
How much do you want to send me?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:26:39
Ohhh okay gotcha. Cool stuff. I’ve just been spending a lot of time over in rbtc and they’re constantly saying how bitcoin is going to fail because of the high fees and I’m just trying to gather more information on that 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:59:00
Damn, so almost 10% of the tip is gone in fees? How does it scale? Like if I wanted to do a $0.50 tip?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:06:35
How much does it cost you to send that tip?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:34:32
how much BTC are they loaded with?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:20
Why would they want it to fail if they could make a ton of money from it?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:45:50
You can transfer from Coinbase to GDAX for free, then withdraw from GDAX to an external address for free as well. So it only works if you have your coins on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:59
I’ve been watching those buy walls as well, someone big is helping push the price back up
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:44:42
Thanks! So I’m kind of confused, how do I go about doing something with this tip? Can I transfer it to a wallet? Or can I use it to tip someone else with?
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:54:19
Ahhh, that makes sense. Do you have any idea why they are all convinced LN won’t work to decrease transaction fees? I just feel stupid because everyone on that sub is positive BTC is going to fail, but it seems like everyone here feels the exact opposite. Is there somewhere to get more information without so much personal bias? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:53:27
They are. I’ve done it. Unless they changed in the past week. I’m assuming they’re making so much money from the Coinbase fees and taker fees on GDAX they’re okay taking that loss to ensure users stay on their platform 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:37:13
Yep. Now is the time to get in
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:49:42
I'll take it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:04:27
I thought the point of futures were to protect risk of an asset. Like if I’m a wheat farmer I would put some money into the short of wheat prices so if there was a drought and I lost all my crops causing the price to drop I would have some protection from losing all my money due to the futures contract being paid out. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:11:09
Is there a mobile GDAX app?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:32:09
I meant compared to the bank account transfer
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:22:49
You’re right. Look at his comment history. Awful ass men’s rights shit
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:03:57
I thought the alt right were the isolationists that don’t want to interfere with other countries? Also pretty sure most people are generally against war, I don’t really get your point
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:45:31
Well duh, it was a general example. It’s obviously way more complicated. But the main point is if you have enough money you can manipulate the market in your favor 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:40:27
The way you state your facts matter
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:34:30
Lmaooo you’re joking right
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:41:35
You’re right. That’s why you need a bunch of money to do it successfully. You can also use buy/sell walls to trick people/ stall the price
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:18:32
Did you end up getting paid in full?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:13:09
Is this your troll account to make r/bitcoin look bad by calling for random boycotts? I know r/btc has been jerking it to that recently
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:40:00
There is a lot of overlap and the person I was talking about posts to both. Stop trying to defend these people. Their view points are harmful. 
Edit: I see you are active in TD so I’m sure you’ll have a nuanced view of the situation 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:24:15
We did it
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:13:08
Do you know how black people got into those specific areas? Through over 200 years of slavery, segregation, and government oppression. If you’ve ever looked into the causes rather than the end result you may end up with the whole picture and not come off as racist
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:10:37
Don’t forget bounty0x.io they have their alpha platform up and running
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:09:57
How would they know if you did the project correctly if they didn’t get to see it first?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:32:12
You sell down to 9500, people get scared and panic sell down to 9200, you buy at the lower prices
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:09:35
So you support this post? I understand men face issues women don’t. Why does that mean men should hate all women? 
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:17:23
Damn and I’m getting downvoted for calling him out. Why is this sub so toxic sometimes
Edit: looks like we must be on r/all since my comments are starting to get upvoted
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:47:21
That’s the problem bounty0x is solving. But in general the host is a reputable source so you have to trust them. There’s a huge issue in this space about exactly what you’re talking about
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:44:00
Yup. OP listen to these people. Coinbase has always had the 3.99% fee for credit cards. Your bank was who decided buying crypto was considered a cash advance which caused the extra charges from the banks end.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:11:31
M’baguette 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:11:17
We better not let the hacker 4chan hear about this or I bet he’ll be all over it
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:43:36
I’ve read that double spending is only economically feasible for amounts over 50k usd. Is that false? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:16:04
Haha came here and just looked at the current price. This is why you wait to start bragging OP
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:24:22
We did it
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:08:24
Only if you have money in a USD wallet though I’m pretty sure
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:01:33
One time fee? Forever? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:33:53
What about 0-conf
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:30:33
The leading zeros are a big thing. When there are three or more leading zeroes it sometimes becomes tough to recognize just at a glance how big the number is without counting out each zero. I can easily tell apart 1.18472 vs 12.183728 
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:50:33
Sounds like tether 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:49:25
If you’re really comparing being called racist to all of the actual shit minorities have to deal with in this country you can go fuck yourself
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:30:18
So we need more women to commit suicide is what you’re saying? /s
Also most feminists I know are aware of those issues and realize they are important. 
Your first paragraph is so hypocritical when you start out saying “the left is like a woman” and then try to lecture me on logical fallacies
