Absolutely.

So dumb. The Americans are killing their own monopoly on owning the world currency. There will be an alternative and if that alternative allows transfers without questions people will use this.  
Wait ... isn’t that what Bitcoin does?

Bottom line is anyone who has watched this since November 2017, can tell Bitcoin is "worth" around $7000 in the public mind.  Below we buy and above we sell.  Meanwhile the professional manipulators are getting rich and the hodlers (like me) will be rewarded in the end.

Awesome.  We get so slanted and opinionated and focused. I personally disliked Yellen to the core.  
When she responds like this it reminds me that Bitcoin is issue number 671 in her mind and she’s just repeating what others have told her.  
We need to stay above it.  Bravo to OP.

35% is tough. Many out there that lend at 50%
@_date: 2018-10-22 19:38:21
Doesn’t anyone seriously think Tether doesn’t have at least 50% of their stated amount?  
If they have 50% and they run Bitfinex. Other than an indictment from the US government they’ll always be in business.

**KYC required.**  And changely will take your money first, and then explain they need information second.  And you’re trapped for your own money to be released. 
When Trezor integrates something into their software to run smoothly and then say they *“bear zero responsibility”* for it, I find this to be disingenuous and poor business practices.  
I really hope to enact this feature there’s a huge pop up and lots of explanation and this is not enabled by default.

Do not trust the dollar vigilante.  
My friend got screwed for a big amount of money on their site when they promised him Mexican citizenship and never delivered.  
Maybe my friend was naive.  But still was scammed.

So wish I was a kid.  
But I’m aware that the banking system is fully government controlled and stifles decent and enforced the status quo 
This ultimately favors the rich and connected and hurts the lower middle class and poor.  From lack of choice to fees to rulings like closing this guys bank account. 
Bitcoin is like Poker.  The rules apply fairly to everyone and no special breaks.  It’s perfect but way better than our current system.  
*Edit:  Strange argument to attack me personally saying I’m a kid.  Even a 15yr kid could see this*

This is fantastic news if true.  I had a wirex card and many people I knew had them as well.  
Super simple company to work with.  USA is nice but come home to Latin America soon as well!

Well said.  Remember neocon and conservative is very different.

Modern banking is a tool of government tyranny especially in India &amp; China.  
Most are happy in the USA and Europe but that certainly doesn’t make it moral or ethical or right. 
If a government tyrant took over the United States tomorrow they could freeze all bank accounts of everyone they didn’t like. Imagine if you’re a Democrat or Republican tomorrow banking didn’t work for you.  
This is exactly what happened when the Roman Republic transitioned into the Roman Empire.  They stole all assets of perceived enemies.  Same in France during the revolution. History has many other obvious reminders. 
Not to mention I’m sure the guy who didn’t get his paycheck due to this bank closing feels so happy that it’s working for most people.  
Keep your eyes closed and live like the sheep or wake up and join those of us fighting for liberty and freedom against despotism and tyranny.

From February 2015 to November 2015 we sat between $220 and $280 the entire time.  
*Note:  I remember being so happy when we’d raise up $10 for the day!*
So get comfortable boys.  This could last a while!
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:52:59
In 2015 we sat between $220 and $280 most of the year.  
I feel like 2019 could be a repeat of 2015.

This guy has his pulse on the market.  He told us all to buy Bitconnect and that was brilliant. 
I’m selling my Bitcoin today. Thank you Carlos and please let me know if you have anymore excellent advice.

If they’re making $1.3B a year why do they need to raise more money?  Especially a paltry sum like $400m
@_date: 2018-10-22 19:32:36
Companies like Bitrefill cashing out their coins.  
People in India and elsewhere being paid for work spending their bitcoins. 
Iranians and Venezuelans taking in payments from overseas as their countries can participate in the normal banking system.  
We need to keep building this ecosystem much bigger of course.  90% is still mostly investments.  People buying hoping their coins rise in fiat value.  
But even if 10% is the normal economy like you say.  That ain’t that bad.   And getting bigger everyday.

Scary stuff. Why we need Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 19:25:51
When we talk regulations.  We’re talking about the exchange of Bitcoin to fiat or vice versa. 
This is why we want as many pure on chain businesses and companies as possible. Those can never be regulated and always will be immune to the whims of government.  
Companies like Coinbase and Bitpay are reliant on regulation. 
While companies like Trezor and Blockchain.com, are fully on chain companies that can move countries in an instant if their current home countries dislike their business practices.  
**Super important to understand the difference.**
For now we need both. Ideally we will move to a world when only on chain companies are needed.

That’s a USA viewpoint and not true at all. Look at Bitrefill. Crypto is the best and only way to immediately load a prepaid phone or gift card from your home.  Outside the USA we don’t have pretty banking and the governments are corrupt as hell and the banks can’t be trusted.
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:41:47
Go to Latin America where I live or Africa or many Asian nations.  Banking is a total and complete nightmare.  Panama papers made it much worse for everyone.

Bitcoin is one of the few if not only ways to hold and hide funds from government.  Bitcoin will be and is used by the ultra rich to hold a % of their wealth and this trend will grow especially outside the USA where you can’t trust your government and won’t trust a dollar or euro.  
Small guys owning a bitcoin or two is what you’re taking about but when the CIA needs to pay a Russian or Iran spy $10m for info, those guys ain’t taking dollars in a Bahamas bank because it can be frozen. They’ll want Bitcoin and the fundamentals are strong and more people get it daily, more exchanges are opened, more ATMs and debit cards are available.  
I actually think the price should be higher but Wall Street funds are shorting it and manipulating it and that’s been proven and has support from the US govt.  You’re looking at this from a USA viewpoint which is 25% or so of the world economy.  A lot but not all.
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:48:24
Wow. Never realized how tiny this was. Bitmex does a billion daily.

You can open a bank account in a day and if your bank account is frozen you have SOME recourse and normally the IRS gives back at least half.  Trust me, I am no fan of the American banking system and a major fan of Bitcoin but what phileo said is coming from a USA/Europe viewpoint and that is not the entire world.

Charlie Shrem scammed DASH for a good amount.  I appreciate his help early and definitely agreed with a lot of political positions but personally he doesn’t seem like a good and honorable person. 
I wouldn’t be shocked if the twins are right on this one. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:11:13
Possible but unlikely. Would break our ten year trend and seriously be a major problem long term if we dropped to 1k and sat there.  
We’re still 6x over the start of 2017 and about the same price as a year ago when the insane craziness happened with Tether getting the subpoena on Dec 6th which brought the system to insane levels.  
Now Tether has sold the fake billion and is back to what they should be and the price is where it should be as well.

I understand we’re all pro-Bitcoin and this is another excellent example of why we need Bitcoin. 
However, I’d also like to say the people are Venezuela are suffering and it’s a sad situation and we should all hope someone puts a bullet in Muduro’s head sooner than later.
