Seems like you got a lot of cash so sell whenever, however if you don't and you just invested a lot of your money , hold hold hold hold .
And then once you do that. Hold again.

Iiberals hate bitcoin because they like to control wealth, and bitcoin they cannot control.
Republicans don’t understand bitcoin and if they do are scared of it because it’s “new” and conservatives generally like to stay away from change
Trump will do what liberals hate so all in all Trump is pro bitcoin

The price of one bitcoin at that point would be very expensive. Most people would hold for example ".002343" mbtc not one whole bitcoin.
Bitcoin is divisible! There is more than enough for everyone.
