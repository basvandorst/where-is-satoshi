The post a few days ago where the dude paid almost $700 for porn just because he "wanted to use some bitcoin" lmao.

Considering this is literally "no man's land," I have to agree that no one can predict what is going to happen in the crypto space.

But isn't it almost **all** fat kids in Capitalism, and aren't all the kids in America - fat or not yet fat, stealing food? (literally and figuratively, while humans starving to death all over earth.)

I was once holding a portfolio of coins as well, but I recently went all BTC.  At least for the time being.  I am fearful that at any moment the world's elite will collude to buy as much of it as possible, literally skyrocketing the value to astronomical numbers in no time at all, as well as the possibility that a government or two could collapse overnight. 
Do you think the recent allegations against vitalik hurt ethereum at all or do you feel the system is independent of him now?

I literally think about it every day.  I had all the information but FUD kept me from buying and holding... I would buy and then sell if it went up a dollar or two; eventually I made a couple vital mistakes and lost a lot.  Also lost a lot when cryptsy went under.  Now I have lots of locations of storage and never put all the eggs in one basket.
Just stay focused on chipping away!  You are still in the very early 1%!

Thanks for the comment.  I agree with this completely. I believe the bitcoin chain is going to disrupt everything.
