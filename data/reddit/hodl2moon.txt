nice score.  if you asked for this brand, what did you like vs the trezor?  
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:28:15
this is what i came to see what people thought of this vs the trezor?

hey, 0.04 added in today's times is nothing to balk at, let alone when prices go back and beyond where they will be.

Can confirm as both a longtime migraine sufferer and btc hodler

Great video and very informative. I knew what DCA was but you broke it down nicely and added some other good points. I would like to add that if buying weekly you might want to factor in transaction fees (depending on method of acquisition) since that would be a bit more impactful. At this point I stick with DCA and do sometimes vary if there is a market dip. Luckily I haven't been burned so far. Sure I don't always catch the bottom but it's almost always lower than when the auto would draft. Thanks again!

I'd like to think I'd put 1/3 in. Congrats and best of luck!!!
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:05:16
Timed that dip about perfectly. Woke up to 6.6 and almost bought 1k but fell back to sleep watching the ticker. Ragrets.

congrats! recent medical issues have cost me part of my stockpile.  once i get back on my feet i hope to regain and surpass the 1.75 i held.

Glad I never signed up. Just deleted the app
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:06:25
Glad I bought.1 at 7.3k but wish ida just blown my weekend money. Still glad I caught a decent dip.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:12:23
Does it have an app ?
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:17:52
no judgement here.  as long as you can be functional and not endanger anyone else, go for it. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:18:01
Very familiar with it. Was the new go to add med for teens I saw a huge switch from the adderalls and Ritalins bc it "was less addictive."
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:19:12
apparently i cant link it so i will dim you it
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:57:35
Not gonna lie I initially read that as lines of "coke" and was a bit surprised at the candor of the tweet. I'm working on getting that coffee made. My apologies but good post.

It's really easy if you get some DMT. Basically dissolve it in some ejuice or PG/VG if you prefer. Heat a bit to fully dissolve and make it evenly suspended. Their are plenty of TEQs online you can check out. Good luck and happy space travels. Feel free to shoot me a DM if you have any questions!! 
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:14:47
I prefer geltabs if I'm going to dose. Actually prefer mushrooms over lsd and if we're being honest i prefer lsd + fungi + a couple hits on a DMT vape cart. Oh and add Tipper live and I'm golden ����

especially given the context of this, it a public presentation, &amp; also the possibility of personality traits that might contribute (speaking from experience and not judging) that could all culminate in this rush of information.  if the context is valid and ultimately understood, then that's all that matters.  
i've had a customer at one of my previous jobs ask me if i was ok because i was talking really fast.  i was so perplexed by their statement.  i seriously and calmly asked if they comprehended everything we discussed and they eventually said yes.  it's like they were trying to call me out on me being high, when in actuality we had a fairly high level conversation and they received what they came for and thanks to me and my work knowledge, for even cheaper.  
after he left i was still shocked.  i was just multitasking and busy.  at that job you have 10 things you need to be doing and can't just sit around and shoot the shit.  this was in a city known for their impatience, so it's not like i was offending their southern charm.   
if i spoke half the thoughts going through my head i'm sure most would think i'm crazy, but this was me just talking to them about their current situation and need.  i addressed that specifically, identified the problem, and quickly resolved the issue.  sorry for talking to fast and getting your product for basically free and faster than most places.

Sadly after years it just doesn't do anything for me despite years of abstinence. Ah I miss those early years. BTC still giving me thrills and chills.

I think I got the right ratio of water:ground coffee today.  took me a bit to grind the beans, as I used a new hand grinder.  just backed a bean roaster on kickstarter that i wonder how it will turn out.  i was going to back (and may still..damn need to check)  a home brew machine automated by a Raspberry Pi.  Figured i'd rather have some cool technology than try and get some "primo" machine.  i started/got used to drinking cheap black coffee while on clinical rotations in a hospital, so my taste-buds aren't too discerning.  I'd be hard pressed (seriously no pun intended) to tell the difference in quality, if in a blind taste study. 
working on the second cup now.  if i were to answer the door the post-person probably wouldn't scream at first glance, so we are headed in the right direction.

Has to be one of the best clips I've seen this week 
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:16:59
Haha. Yeah they are. Unfortunately I'm no kid anymore and my friend and I have made them. It's pretty easy and they are super convenient. Having "the machine" or pipe is still the best way to blast off. These I use for more measured hits that get me where I want to go. He even makes his own deemster. I haven't done that in over a decade. 
Bonus point  for having visited the elves and used that exact term and  for knowing about the DW. Make sure your OpSec is good and you'll be fine. Happy space travels ��

TD Ameritrade needs to give someone a raise. Bout the most non FUD story/headline I've read in quite some time.  
I like my btc prices just like my high, over the moon.  
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:02:57

@_date: 2019-09-12 21:40:18
So hodl? I could deal with that reasoning.
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:15:27
Same. Gimme gimme.
