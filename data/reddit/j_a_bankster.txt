Samson Mow seems pre-occupied 24/7 trying to downplay Bitmain... Does he not have a company to represent himself? And does he not see an irony in him trying to shit on Bitmain all day long, a company earning billions in profit yearly, when his own company barely turns over a couple million per year? Doesn't Bitmain earn in a month what Blockstream has earned in its entire existence?
It's like an amateur tennis player critique Roger Federer...

This ''article'' is describing a consequence, not the original intend... Bitcoin was designed to be one thing and one thing only; an electronic P2P Cash System....
Given the immutability and decentralization together with its properties to be used as frictionless cash, Bitcoin's popularity, utility and economic viability soared from the very start for years in a row.... The one thing that did not work out was to find a consensus to scale and keep the blockchain friction less and functioning as originally intended.. In this regards Bitcoin has failed.... The only reason Bitcoin kept rising in price and is still very expensive is nothing but good old greed and Lambo dreams... You can virtue signal about all kinds of things but this is the bottom line...
Bitcoin was meant for everyone on this planet, not for the wealthy buying mansions... the digital gold narrative, together with this narrative that Bitcoin is for the rich sending millions across the Ocean is merely a biased justification.... Without utility for all - from a Somalian farmer to a Swiss banker - the blockchain will be nothing than the worlds most expensive baseball card collection, and destined to be overtaken by a competitor...
