"Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer" means your browser doesn't know the certificate issuer. It doesn't mean that the certificate is wrong per se. The issuer is COMODO, which has a bit of a history regarding trust... cheap certs, but meh. I didn't know that FF (nss) removed them, but I'm glad they did.
Also, the NEO&amp;BEE shares where moved from LMB to Havelock, in case you wanted to buy some: 
Edit: I don't know how I interpreted that you use FF. Checked with current FF and it still knows the issuer. You still can import the COMODO root cert into your browser manually and you should have a trusted connection. At least as trusted as you trust comodo ;)

Due to last minute changes to the Bcash (Bitcoin Cash) code, there are issues in the Bcash Bitcore backend server code. As a consequence, we were not able to release full BCH support in TREZOR Wallet in time. This is being addressed as of this moment.
You may still use our tool to send your BCH to an exchange, once Bcash forks. It may take hours for the first BCH block to be mined. The coin-splitting tool will only be available then.

Use bitcoin for what it is. A means to exchange value. I want to say: use it to buy stuff instead of using credit cards, paypal etc.

Hi. long time reddit lurker and bitcoin enthusiast here. Just had to make an account to report how smooth my order there went. Until now, I only had the chance to buy digital goods with my btc (humblebundle, usenet account etc). After reading this post, I discovered that lieferservice.de not only has my favourite Indian restaurant, but also my favourite Sushi place in the list for my town.
Decided to go for Sushi today (I'm eating it right now while typing this) and I have to say that the technical implementation with bitpay on the website is absolutely professional, even better than the humblebundle coinbase one.
Tomorrow I'll try their android app.

It depends on what kind of wallet you set up. I don't know how online wallets handle this, but the usual wallet you have on your local pc/smartphone let you make as many public addresses as you like. Some prefer to make one per transaction which makes sense depending on your usecase.
I have a few fixed addresses I use more than once and use single-use addresses for the rest.
