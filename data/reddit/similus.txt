There is a chicken and egg problem.  As long as nobody uses LN the fees won't go down and if the fees won't go down the opening and closing channel makes it too expensive to use.  So my excitement for the time being is rather limited. Maybe when/if exchanges adopt segwit  there will be some improvement. However I don't see any real incentives for exchanges to make the changes as they are making a killing these days. And people don't seem to be deterred of expensive transactions.

At the level of adoption we have right now, I don't think this is possible. The natural scarcity  and predictable emission rate  precludes bitcoin of any sort of stability. Only when we reach  levels of adoption such that your grandmother is comfortable with paying with bitcoin or a bitcoin backed asset, will we see a stable price, in terms of Gold.

If the fear is centralization and the lightning network works as promised what's the problem of having greater block size limits if blocks won't be filled anyways due to LN? It's the same thing as with global warming, even if science supposedly isn't certain about global warming, it makes sense to curb carbon emissions just in case man mad global warming is real.  As I see it if LN doesn't work as promised we will have a big block problem at our hands, that could potentially usher the demise of the network.

They do have money, but Chileans are financially illiterate and very conservative. The banks took care of that. If you want to invest you can't do it by yourself you need to talk to a financial advisor  in your bank and they will offer you their products. It's almost impossible as an individual to buy a stock, you can only buy the ridiculously expensive mutual funds.  It's the most patriarcal bank system you can imagine.  Thank god for bitcoin.  I truly hope I see the day were banks in Chile die a slow and painful death. It's the most disgusting oligopoly I know of.

I think he means an economy where the borders of the 20th century are irrelevant and trade is a all settled efficiently on the blockchain, in what is essentially a global free trade. The diversity in the economic interactions will come more from the blockchain, because different blockchains will be better for different purposes. We will look back at sovereign currencies as the arcadic way exchange of value was done in the the last century.

So are you the miners still in control of the updates? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:09:29
I wish there was more research in that area, all what you say makes sense but it has never been tried before because of the current paradigm. I hope that one day there is a deflationary school of economics which studies that at an academic level. With respect to the housing, what you say is true in a country with lots of space and a decentralized economy but when you have centralization pressure because of economic opportunities, houses or more correct land is an appreciating asset and a deflationary economy would result in a pseudo feudal state where the very few rich own all the land and rent it out the the poor. So that land owners would somehow replace the banks in that regard.

I mean he is not wrong, that's why we tell people only to invest what they can afford to lose. The only problem with his analysis is that calling bitcoin a bubble is very reductionistic. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:17:56
That's actually quite funny 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:24:20
I can tell you that statistically the stock market will inevitably rise a yearly average 5% in the next 30 years.  The whole idea of pension funds is that long term there are investments that will inevitably rise unless there is some apocalyptic event.  So Bitcoin is in a similar league. People who today pay $8000 per bitcoin belive that cryptocurrency will play an important role in the next 30 years and bitcoin will be a part of it.   And since it is an asset with limited supply the rational is that it will inevitably rise. Now if you are here for the quick buck you better be patient if you get unlucky. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:50:28
Very insightful, so you think it's just impossible to have a deflationary based economy because the incentives for growth are just not there?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:40:25
The next great financial crisis will also be the last one 
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:45:55
Although true for consumer credits , what I can't wrap around my head is how you can have a mortgage in a deflationary based economy. Maybe deflation at that point is low enough that it's less than whatever a bank charges you now, but then again who would lend you that money? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:18:01
