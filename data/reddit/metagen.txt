there is NO argument  
he does not like log scales, fine but WHY? because "real markets" dont behave that way!  
i see... lol  
edit : if you dont "crush" the graph you would see data  in the very past as a flat line wouldnt you?
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:49:29
yeah, anyways i dont see what the big deal is even if he used coupons  
lets say he used throwaways to ask himself for a btc donation adress to make it look like he has no ulterior motive, so what? he gave away pizza that other people would have to pay 1000$ for and all he got was not even 500 in donations  
also the guy who suggests its not charity but vanity because people thank him can go suck a dick

"you'd begin to be concerned about what I'd call "FBI-Level" issues we would have if money laundering occurred in any significant way in our games. So official our stance became against it.

@_date: 2014-01-05 22:26:48
you misunderstood, your financial interest stems from the fact that you hold fiat  
is it any different from someone holding bitcoin?  
you think bitcoiners are working for some secret cabal of masters?  
call me crazy or whatever you like but i dont see the difference, there are lots of people around here with no basis to their criticism just bashing at btc because they feel like they missed out or feel threatened by new technology  
its not the first time in history

and that is relevant how?  
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:21:38
knowledge isnt bad for cash too, it requires you know how to count and look for the anti counterfeiting measures, also it requires a wallet, lockbox, vault etc!  
if you want to reduce btc to a minumum you can share your memorized private keys and require absolutley nothing  
but if you want extra functionality you need to bring all the big boy stuff, like with cash

Oh you know him so well. Whats wrong with sending pizzas there are good reasons to do it, pizza places are everywhere and pretty much everyone has at least one kind they like to eat. Its also a very direct way to help, little gets lost on the way in the name of bureaucracy. Maybe he has more money than time in any case its not up to us to judge him, i doubt the people with full pizza bellys give a shit that we think hes vain or a scammer! Let him decide how he does it.  
If you did fork a penny or volunteered then dont feel adressed by the fuck you. otherwise...

yeah, no! these marks were made with modern day tools as a carpenter myself i can tell!
a 1800 sawmill would use a straight blade thats being yanked up and down, no way it would leave marks like this! if you look at the surface you can spot these parallel lines they are caused by a plaining tool, a 1800s worker would have used a hand plane  
maybe its "antique" wood (lol) but the guy didnt do anything but cut them apart with power tools and slap on some glaze  
there is no craftsmanship involved here whatsoever

ill just point out that i heard the same kind of shit years ago, you think anyone imagined that 500k $ house transaction at the time when it was 2 pizzas for 10k btc?  
laugh all you want private enterprise has taken over spaceflight  
no one conciously pushed the btc value its just a matter of market forces  
take a look at the canadian coin if you want an example of what happens to those  
edit : half a million is not even enough to get yourself a bank licence lol

did you see the part where they wanted to steal directly from accounts with 100k+?  
trust your banks people! LOL
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:17:59
The cost will be that they will tell you to fuck off.
You will have trusted the insurance, get stolen from and now have to provide proof of your innocence.  
At least thats the only thing i can see happening, insurance fraud is not a new thing anyone who had to try and deal with insurance companys knows that!

Not on an exchange but thats not the point, assuming the shipyard accepts bitcoin its still no good. No one except one person on the world owns enough btc to pay for such goods. Price needs to rise dramatically if we ever want to buy/sell companys, big scale contracts etc

i dont agree with you on bitpay, they seem to have created a profitable business  
consider a situation like cyprus coming up again, that would drive many people to convert their vulnerable assets to bitcoin (or at least something that cant be stolen as easily) which in turn would affect the banking system as a whole  
now depending on the scale of this hypothetical event people invested in fiat would feel this to some degree  
i dont think this is far fetched, trust in the system is at an all time low

alright so one in a thousand sawmills used a circular saw in 1813   
as you can see from your link they didnt became widespread untill steam engines were  
"Made out of the floor joists of a barn built in 1918" ok so that makes our discussion superfluous  
i still stand by my point, its old boards cut apart with modern power tools sold at an outrageous price  
to each his own i guess  
EDIT: It is common practice to define "antique" as applying to objects at least 100 years old  
and i doubt that includes plain boards and rocks  
its just a marketing ploy to pull in clueless people and rich hipsters  
wat no btc orders? btc must be for hoarding! derp

@_date: 2014-01-16 22:29:40
your argument is flawed imo, maybe they get "half" but its twice as valueable
you say in another comment the value of the materials fall when you buy them but thats a silly way to look at it as the materials/tools are transformed into your plane/house whatever and the faster you do it the more your profit margin grows
but you blame it somehow on deflation  
let me ask you this in an inflationary system do your tools become more valueable as time passes? did you ever sell a car or truck higher after you drove it a few months?
edit : your argument is basically - if i bought the ingredients for the 10k btc pizzas back then and took 5 years to make it i could now sell my pizza only for btc dust

This is not true, utility increases when price rises.  
Imagine BTC being worth a fraction of a cent, who could buy anything using btc and who would merchants sell to?

The risk is their wasted time, they could have used their computer to play oblivion instead as you have mentioned.  
You say they dont deserve it, i say they are heros because without them the protocol would not have cought on. 
They used their hardware to secure the network and now they reap the rewards, you realize hardware breaks down by using it right?

purchase a bitcoin? and do what? i dont think you grasped the concept  
if you accept btc for your automatic crane things it might lure in a customer you would not have gotten otherwise  
the cost and effort of accepting another form of payment are minimal and the potential gain huge  
no one cares if you buy a bitcoin or not

you want corruption? how about this  
RBI Bhopal was rocked by one of the most sensational frauds in the history of Reserve bank of India, when the then Regional Director Uma Subramaniam received a call from a person claiming to be a relative of the Governor Dr Y V Reddy, who "badly needed Rs 20 lakh in cash". Without verifying the identity of the caller, the Regional Director arranged the money by coercing her employees to immediately withdraw all their cash. Subramaniam herself went in an autorickshaw and handed over the cash to the unknown person, who quietly walked away. Later it was discovered that the "Governor's relative" was an impostor. The Regional Director was charge-sheeted following a departmental enquiry and was demoted from CGM rank to GM for her foolishness and gross negligence of duty. But subsequently she found favour with the RBI Top Management and was not only reinstated to her earlier position, but also given important portfolios like supervision and regulation of commercial banks and NBFCs.

fyi you are getting downvoted because you dont contribute anything to the discussion  
all you do is call people pathetic morons  
have another downvote
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:07:46


what are you talking about btc inflates since 09 and will continue to do so for a very long time
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:30:32
"To be successful, money must be both a medium of exchange and a reasonably stable store of value."  
btc IS successful and to demand stability now is just naive  
the points he brings up are irrelevant the problems do not exist
if you see btc fulfills one of your needs, use it! the end  
krugmans opinion is worthless
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:47:20
Its a great way to get people interested and let them play around a bit without having to worry too much
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:35:46
you will eat him alive!
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:58:46
i would say because the notion that you better spend it now before others slowly steal it from you has gotten us to where we are today
if a person needs something he will buy it
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:58:55
because there is some fuss around its open source status or something
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:53:59
Just wanted to add that this clown got the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences which was ceated by the Sveriges Riksbank not the actual Nobel Prize thats for real science   
edit : another one of his insights "By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:49:35
but those will only be successful if they do something better than bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:46:29
 would be one way
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:19:55

even if satoshi uses his coins i would argue that he created something useful and deserves reward  
clearly he had a good idea maybe he will come up with more and now has the means to realize it
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:49:03
they could ban the exchange of USD to Drugs... oh wait

"Think of an activist buying a forbidden book, a secure laptop or flight for an undercover journalist, medicine for that condition insurance companies shouldn't know about. Or perhaps something which is illegal today: It could be abortion, a gay magazine, a given medicine, drugs, weapons, alcohol, gambling, services and a long etcetera depending on the country and period in history." or perhaps a hitman? .. not judging here lol
@_date: 2013-03-14 19:49:39
