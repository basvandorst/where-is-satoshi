One can directly buy from Coinbase. Bitfinex only offers a platform on which sellers and buyers can trade (it could be possible that some or most buyers or sellers are actually Bitfinex of course.) Remember, do not trust. Verify.

You could hack it, with an insanely (and as of now non-existent) super/quantum computer.
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:09:03
If how BTC is traded remains the same (unless there is a decentralized exchange? is leverage possible?), then will it not remain suppressed?
I see the true value of Bitcoin coming after it is no longer possible to easily exchange it with others, post government-crackdown (assuming this thing isn't CIA to start with), because by then it could be very valuable \*for use\*. Hope that makes sense.

I own 2 of the main Bitcoin debit cards from  and from  I also own 2 prepaid cards but those aren't anything special since you have to preload them with Fiat.
I love using my Bit-X debit card everywhere, likewise with my Xapo. Once a make a transaction, the Bitcoin is sold at the current exchange rate, not one from before or after.

Probably not.
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:27:10
Absolutely! No need to organise Local Bitcoin meet ups and wait for several hours often. The fees, I've had 3% to 8% (usually 5%) are fair enough and beat Local Bitcoins, especially once you take into account the debit card's convenience and ease of access to funds.
The card doesn't exchange from BTC to fiat then to BTC again, it only converts the amount of BTC needed for the transaction to go through.
As they mentioned in the article, I think fees will continue to drop in the future.
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:07:14
Less than 0.25%.

@_date: 2015-06-10 05:37:47
Personally it's between  and  Bit-X has a 0% fee promotion right now until September. They actually have pretty solid liquidity and when the fees are around, they are pretty low. They trade USD, EUR, GBP, BTC, LTC and GHs. Bit-X uses multi signature addresses and transactions and is also licensed. So I like them! Kraken pretty professional too for EUR trading! I love both site layouts.

This isn't a debit card, it's a prepaid card. The difference is that with debit cards you don't need to manually load it (examples:  and Xapo). With prepaid ones you lose out on fees each time you load it and if the exchange rate changes.
EDIT: No ATM withdrawals? Hmm my Bit-X Card and Xapo are preferred, they are true debit cards.

This isn't a debit card, it's a prepaid card. The difference is that with debit cards you don't need to manually load it (examples:  and Xapo). With prepaid ones you lose out on fees each time you load it and if the exchange rate changes.
It isn't the first card in Europe either Bit-X and Xapo launched theirs long before.

Partnered with Bit-X who have released the card already (CCEDK release theirs in a few weeks).
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:28:45
 and Xapo.com have true debit cards (that is: the balance is converted from bitcoins to fiat at the time of transaction). With Bit-X the balance can be in any of the offered currencies, BTC, LTC, USD, EUR, GBP (each have their own wallets on bit-x).
A debit card converts from bitcoin to fiat once a transaction is made. Your 1 btc stays 1 btc until spent (if $10 is spent, only $10 is converted). 
A prepaid card needs prior exchanging by the user to make the card hold fiat. Your 1 btc becomes $ and stays that way.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:16:45
How does one update? Just download and install it?
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:55:29

@_date: 2015-05-31 11:36:54
They seem to be working fine but still aren't debit cards like Bit-X and Xapo's. You need to manually fund it and you'll lose out if the exchange rate changes.
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:16:00

@_date: 2015-05-28 12:55:20
In a nutshell yep :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:43:02
It would create more units.. So bitcoin would become inflationary. As of now there is a total of 21,000,000 * 100,000,000 units so 21*10^15 units. Now if suddenly we add more decimal points to say 9, we will have 21*10^16 units in circulation.

Xapo doesn't have a functional card (at least for me at the moment) which is why I use  instead. 
With Bit-X the balance can be in any of the offered currencies, BTC, LTC, USD, EUR, GBP (each have their own wallets on bit-x).
I also trust Bit-X more than Xapo (support issues and underdelivery is huge with Xapo).
@_date: 2015-01-20 11:02:19
Check out  multisignature addresses and transactions are the norm.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:51:24
Hmm it could affect it. When you think about it, if you keep adding smaller units, you have an infinite number of them that are usable and tradable. Exchanges would reference these individual units rather than the original unit (1 bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:41:12

One well generated wallet is fine.
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:29:06
Will try my best (I'm not exactly an expert but from asking a lot I have developed a sufficient understanding). Any questions just ask!
First of all make sure you are on a clean laptop (you are relatively sure you don't have a virus or any other malware on it). Make sure you don't have any extensions that could intercept your data, disable or pause all extensions running in your browser (chrome recommended).
You will be using  so to download the webpage go to  and click "download zip". Download it.
Then switch off your internet on your laptop (wifi off) and close all applications/extensions that you don't need and/or were downloaded from the internet.
Extract the zip and run the webpage offline in order to generate a paper wallet. Go to the "paper wallet" tab and click "hide art" and generate 1 address if you want to create just a simple paper wallet. After checking the box "BIP38 encrypt", encrypt it by entering a passphrase (use a mixture of characters, numbers and letters both upper and lower case, make sure to note it down on paper with a pen if you don't want to forget it).
Click generate and print it, file print or right click print or click "print". I would recommend using a non wifi connected printer which you connect to your laptop with a USB cable. A nice printer to use is a photo printer which you can use by inserting an SD card or USB or by connecting it to your laptop.
Make sure it prints clearly and if you want to safeguard it you can laminate it and store it in a fireproof safe. Make sure to note down the BIP38 passphrase you used (when you want to spend funds from the address you will have to enter this passphrase).
Close all applications which you used and make sure you didn't save the paperwallet on your laptop.
Keep both the paperwallet and passphrase together or seperate them for heightened security (in the case someone finds your paperwallet they won't be able to spend the funds unless they have the passphrase).
To spend the funds, load up a  wallet and import the private key. Make sure to sweep ALL funds from the paperwallet to a new address (new paperwallet address if you want or blockchain address).
If you are going to use  ensure you have a strong passphrase, use 2 factor authentication on both your email and blockchain account and set up a second password to spend funds.
Hope I helped?

@_date: 2015-01-18 21:42:51
Thanks for the kind reply :), give it a go or use another exchange than coinbase in the meantime while you learn more about generating paper wallets ( is a healthy alternative).
As far as I understand/know, the 'big deal' with being offline when you do these things is to prevent an internet connected application/extension (which operates while connected to the internet) from transmitting sensitive data that you generate (in this case a private key) over the internet to others (potentially thieves). It minimises the risk of an application spying on you while this data is generated.
Hope this helps?

They were never set up in the first place to use a card with Crytpos. Plus that was a prepaid card, like ANX, not a debit card like Bit-X/Xapo.
@_date: 2016-03-20 13:22:03
I am a user of all 4 debit cards: BIT-X, Xapo, E-Coin (Wirex now) and AdvCash. I have my validated reasons to side for true debit cards from BIT-X and Xapo over E-Coin and AdvCash who earn through deception (lower exchange rates and murky hidden fees). I am all for the healthy competition, it's the driving force behind the rewards scheme with BIT-X and the quality of Xapo's service.
How were you unimpressed by your BIT-X card in the past? I'm curious.
How are BIT-X/Xapo's cards 1 way rather than 2 way?
@_date: 2016-03-28 11:07:18
Look into BIT-X: 
You can keep your balance in BTC, LTC or USD/GBP/RUB/EUR or a combination of all of those. Low fees and you get rewards the more you spend!

@_date: 2015-01-22 06:35:21
Don't you just love the new million dollar forum? 1 million dollars (more even) has been injected into this forum and look at it..
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:07:06
 for USD/EUR/GBP or GH/s.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:51:17
They do have a licence and address though.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:14:53
If it allows US residents to buy bitcoin, it will.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:21:13
If you want to go with a safe option such as  where multisignature wallets are used as the norm and user security is at a superior level than other exchanges. All while you can trade your BTC if needed and/or buy GH/s (BitFury partnership confirmed so they have legitimate hashrates!)
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:21:06
The currency exchange fee is around 2.5% (you can just use EUR instead and avoid this fee).
Worst case, 6% is still much better than cash-in-hand from LocalBitcoins and you can use this card anytime and anywhere.
Lower fees if you buy an item rather than use it at an ATM.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:14:04
Has an audit even been done? They could (are most likely) be running on a fractional reserve.
@_date: 2015-05-01 13:12:19
Pretty embarrassing..

ANX cards aren't debit cards they are prepaid cards.

BIT-X is an exchange that was launched Q4 of 2014. They launched the first Bitcoin debit cards!

This is annoying me. Fuck the US government.

Shift wasn't, and Xapo was in a beta program.
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:21:47
Never got mine and I've heard bad reviews about it (support and getting the card).

This has so much to do with Bitcoin */s*
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:11:04
They don't exactly hold bitcoin but covert bitcoin to fiat and use that fiat. Still better than a prepaid bitcoin-funded debit card!
@_date: 2016-03-28 23:20:44
Well over a year, they launch there Debit Card range around 1 year ago and I started using the exchange frequently a few months before then :)
@_date: 2016-03-20 08:04:06
Every other card offers this, in a better way. BIT-X/XAPO: Spend when the price is high and buy when it's low. And you DO need to worry about volatility, unlike with the aforementioned card brands since you're deciding when the best time to sell BTC to fiat is. It's a hassle to sell Bitcoin just so that you have fiat to spend through a card, why not let the card do it for you? All there is to do is choose a time when you want to have cash and boom, your BTC, LTC is sold.
Anyway, with BIT-X you have the option of exchanging BTC to USD, EUR, GBP, RUR in advance and spend that directly through the card too!
@_date: 2015-05-23 16:53:19
Choosing that provider maybe? Or not making backups to have it up by now? Maybe I'm wrong, just saying.

I've had between 3 and 5% with them, not too bad for instant cash whenever and wherever. 
They announced that a prepaid card would be released soon.

No problem. Will do so again.
EDIT: Yep, the 'benefits' are pretty superficial if that's the right word.
The product is solving an issue that never existed nor is it bringing anything worthwhile (for the consumer at least) to the table.
@_date: 2016-03-20 14:01:27
I didn't try to come across as spreading FearUncertaintyorDoubt, I apologise. With BIT-X and Xapo you can convert fiat back to BTC (LTC too with BIT-X), since they are exchanges.
Never had issues with BIT-X cards (they released a new range recently) or support.
To each their own I guess. :)
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:58:23

The chips that will be used in everyday items, I assume, aren't extremely powerful. That plus the fact that you lose 75% of revenue makes it extremely likely that it won't be worth your time.
It may seem to the user that "wow I've earned 0.005 BTC" when in fact the electricity costed them much more.
Similar thing with Pay to Click ads (but rather than electricity it's time that's waster). 0.00005 BTC for an hour of sitting there? Not worth it.
Kind of not the same but oh well you get my point I hope.
@_date: 2016-01-25 20:32:30

Welcome to what "banking the unbanked" means - influx of people from all over with big dreams.
It'll die off as the BTC economy establishes itself more. Remember this is a brand new economy. Just like the internet was full of crap back in the day - so is the crypto space.

No thanks
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:47:56
All assets are inflated sure - but no knowledge of anything can make us map something out. One could also think we're about to head into the dark ages of BTC. When it's compressed, stretched, tested by all means possible. And I would argue against there ever being a blank page start to something.

Good luck spending Bitcoin everywhere directly. :P
This serves as a bridge until full Bitcoin acceptance is present.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:34:19
Not sure about fees but I prefer Xapo or Bit-X. Bit-X has plans to launch a prepaid card like advcash's, with lower fees I assume.

I see.. Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:41:23
From my experience, it beats LocalBitcoins.
I've had fees from 2% to 7% (ATM transactions cost more). The average I would say would be 3% to 4% which I'm fairly happy with. Their fees have been lowering since it was launched.
Fees and limits:

So USD is with value, inflation will not lead to its death (?).. All of this is very abstract. There is no right and wrong in what is made up.
We're going from 1 system to another, same problems except for the fact that the new system would have fixed/predictable monetary policy/immutable ledger/other characteristics of Bitcoin. Systems of corruption, inequality, etc will persist.

Sorry but since when is Bitcoin a product that we need to "actively market". It's the pushing of the currency onto people who are perfectly happy with the current system that makes it seem like Bitcoin is shady/unnecessary.
Don't get me wrong, I am an active Bitcoin user and investor, let's just not get carried away and thinking Bitcoin can totally replace the current "banks-are-evil" system, simply because it can't, not at this moment in time.

 is my first choice then  Bit-X is very reliable, very simple to use and still have awesome features for the more experienced traders.

I agree with you there, it's another scheme to make money (for now). However, if it did become used worldwide it wouldn't be compared to anything and so it wouldn't really fluctuate (I assume it'll reach a price point of acceptance). It's volatile now that it is in the early stages, people will use/hoard/trade it for now. As time goes on and if it sticks around, it would become like any other currency - more or less stable (at least in comparison to the goods it can buy, USD/EUR/GBP/etc as compared to BTC will lose value since one is "more better" than the other).
I'll think of a more succinct way to write this if it's too wordy. Tell me please.

A legitimate CloudMining service is  the GH/s is provided by the known ASIC manufacturer BitFury. You can trade GH/s with any supported currency (BTC, LTC, USD, EUR, GBP) all while they mine for you.
Any questions let me know.

@_date: 2015-03-24 08:24:06
There has to be something to link both 'extremes', from using only fiat to using only Bitcoin. This card will provide that link. You'll be able to spend your Bitcoins at every MasterCard accepting outlet, while the community grows and more shops begin accepting Bitcoin directly.

The first Bitcoin debit card with its own reward system!
For every 0.01 USD, EUR or GBP spent through the Bit-X Debit Card, your account will be credited with 10 satoshi (0.0000001 BTC). Bonuses are credited automatically every day at 12:00 AM UTC (00:00 UTC).

OP is asking about a Bitcoin debit card which can be used with your Bitcoin balance.
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:24:26
As I have written in the past:
Will try my best (I'm not exactly an expert but from asking a lot I have developed a sufficient understanding). Any questions just ask!
First of all make sure you are on a clean laptop (you are relatively sure you don't have a virus or any other malware on it). Make sure you don't have any extensions that could intercept your data, disable or pause all extensions running in your browser (chrome recommended).
You will be using  so to download the webpage go to  and click "download zip". Download it.
Then switch off your internet on your laptop (wifi off) and close all applications/extensions that you don't need and/or were downloaded from the internet.
Extract the zip and run the webpage offline in order to generate a paper wallet. Go to the "paper wallet" tab and click "hide art" and generate 1 address if you want to create just a simple paper wallet. After checking the box "BIP38 encrypt", encrypt it by entering a passphrase (use a mixture of characters, numbers and letters both upper and lower case, make sure to note it down on paper with a pen if you don't want to forget it).
Click generate and print it, file print or right click print or click "print". I would recommend using a non wifi connected printer which you connect to your laptop with a USB cable. A nice printer to use is a photo printer which you can use by inserting an SD card or USB or by connecting it to your laptop.
Make sure it prints clearly and if you want to safeguard it you can laminate it and store it in a fireproof safe. Make sure to note down the BIP38 passphrase you used (when you want to spend funds from the address you will have to enter this passphrase).
Close all applications which you used and make sure you didn't save the paperwallet on your laptop.
Keep both the paperwallet and passphrase together or seperate them for heightened security (in the case someone finds your paperwallet they won't be able to spend the funds unless they have the passphrase).
To spend the funds, load up a  wallet and import the private key. Make sure to sweep ALL funds from the paperwallet to a new address (new paperwallet address if you want or blockchain address).
If you are going to use  ensure you have a strong passphrase, use 2 factor authentication on both your email and blockchain account and set up a second password to spend funds.
Hope I helped?

 uses market exchange rates! Xapo and Bit-X are currently the only debit card solutions that use Bitcoin. Bit-X also uses Litecoin, USD, EUR and GBP.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:08:24
I really like Xapo too actually, but there are a few things that could improve that have already been done elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-11-21 13:47:39
BIT-X and Xapo launched theirs many months before CoinBase.

False to both of those
Please read the guide! 
Xapo and Bit-X are the only market leaders (even though I don't like that term since it's quite subjective) in the Bitcoin Debit Card market. E-coin might be one of the leaders in the prepaid card market.

How much? (if you don't mind replying!)
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:37:52
Great for users to easily and conveniently spend their bitcoins wherever. I have had so many occasions when I wanted to purchase something but didn't have cash on me yet did have my wallet (which this card would have been in). It would be ideal.
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:28:10
It depends if you have USD card of a GBP card. If you have a USD card, you'll pay in GBP in the end but will be charged a FX fee of 5% with Xapo. If you have a GBP card, no need to pay this 5% fee.
Take a look at  's cards. Fees can be seen here:  You can choose a GBP card and the FX fee is 3%. Even lower if you pay more for the named white edition.
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:30:50
Those aren't for the new cards!

It's a prepaid card. Users have to sell their BTC and fund the card manually.
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:00:04
Is there margin trading?
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:18:57
Also with Bit-X there a few things that I prefer such as the security settings that users can control themselves aswell as which wallets to use in transactions. So you can split wallets up into savings, spending, etc, etc and have the card only have access to the BTC wallet named spending.

Litecoin is the most popular alt currency. Fake ponzi mining does suck, luckily BIT-X has a mining-capacity confirmed partnership with BitFury, the ASIC manufacturer (

BIT-X's Bitcoin MasterCard looks very promising!

@_date: 2015-10-04 18:48:57
You do suffer from their lower exchange rate however.
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:34:28
And it's very secure? (even the chrome app?)
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:53:35
Will do for sure!
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:30:34
Check out Bit-X.com then!

The 4.95 monthly inactive fee is charged after 1 year of activating the card. Likewise with the monthly fee of 0.95. These 2 fees are for the Named edition. The Named White card is slightly more expensive but you benefit from no monthly fees for the card's life, a lower ATM fee and a lower FX fee in case you spend in another currency than the card's currency (USD, EUR or GBP).
Xapo charges a $12 annual fee, regardless of the number of transactions made (free for the first year like with Bit-X). Source:

The only real alternative to Xapo is Bit-X:  They also have lower fees than Xapo!
Plus they have a cool cashback program!

Old cards were available before October 1, however their fees are higher than the current named option cards.

They launched a few months prior to their bitcointalk service announcement.

They lure users in with nice fees on the outside but in reality fees are much worse. Unfortunately, users don't realise for quite some time.

No, people do yet they are held on behalf of several hundred if not thousands of individuals. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:17:08
Likewise with you. Please look at the card guide page again and read it (you obviously haven't). 
Name embossing is free. 90% can be used. Monthly fees don't apply for 1 year and after that they cost 0.95 usd monthly if you don't do at least 1 transaction. No atm fee if you buy the named white edition and 4.95 usd if you get the named edition.
Sorry but e-coin just doesn't compete but I don't want to have the same discussion with you again.

Old news, not important.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:57:02
Sure, thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:51:30
How so?
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:45:02
Yh why not?
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:30:19
Personally, I have experienced lower fees than Xapo and expecially e-coin (since that card is a prepaid card).
@_date: 2015-02-11 17:45:20
Possibly companies like coinbase, bitstamp, BIT-X
@_date: 2015-03-27 11:20:51
Definitely not the worse possible wallet. Secure it well and you're set.

How does one get ready? Obviously, Bitcoin is just another capitalist invention, then?

I love bitcoin and here's why:
I can send money to anyone, anywhere in the world at anytime, instantly and for barely anything. A few clicks and boom they have that $100 for the clothes they wanted to buy. A few clicks and boom you just sent your parents/siblings/girlfriend $10k for their own lives. Not 10k - $100 in fees, not $10k after several days. No. $10k instantly wherever they were and are now.
That's why I love bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:24:07
That's decent.. How large was the tx? How many satohsi/bytes effective? Would be a useful metric thanks! If you feel like it - you can just link the TX.

BIT-X has a debit card in the works!

That's if you get the non named card. Named cards currency conversion  (ONLY if you pay in a different currency is 3%). I think you're the one misleading people..

@_date: 2019-05-24 20:25:41
Lol a selling point of this tech was "low fees". Now we're at $3 per transaction. I get it - target market. But still..
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:39:03
Wasn't this guy some wacko?
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:09:28
People don't care about holding ACTUAL Bitcoin, that's the shame..

Ok - thanks
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:25:56
Good point
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:53:39
That's called delusion, and it'll lead to demise.. No one fucking using Bitcoin.

Something about how there is no inventive to attack the network since you make more supporting it. I think?
Anyway, theories are just theories. Everything is controlled at the end of the day..
