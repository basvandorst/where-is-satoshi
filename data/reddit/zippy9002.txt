It’s money man. You really don’t know what people do with money? I save it, I invest it, I spend it.
I spend it on stuff online, on restaurants, I pay rent with it, I loan it to family and friends when they need money and they do the same for me.
Why do we like it better than what the banks offers us? Cheaper, faster, never closes, less bugs than my bank app.

It isn’t what’s going on... some big player started mining and we haven’t had a retarget since... blocks are getting mined every 8 minutes instead of 10 minutes. Once the retarget hit the mempool will be full again.

I tried to order but bitpay is not compatible with my wallet (bread which is one of the most popular one). I tried to find an address to send the funds to but bitpay did not seem to want to give me one.

Too bad :(

@_date: 2018-01-01 21:28:46
Banks never works when you need them (their opening hours never work with my schedule) so I want to kill them now. They keep my money in holding for a weeks each time I deposit a check (so now I don’t accept checks anymore and only accept bitcoin and I get the money way faster). I constantly have to go back to get a new card because the one I have stopped working (a bit better now with Apple Pay). Or they freeze my money for no reasons because of fraud or something and I have to take time off work to go in and prove that I’m me. For me the overhead with banks is just way bigger than with bitcoin. And I live in Canada ���� not a third world country.
Just let’s kill the banks ok? Oh and I pay all my taxes, I think it’s a terrible idea to try to do tax avoidance with bitcoin, Monero is much better for that.
Bitcoin isn’t an added extra layer of complexity, it’s electronic cash, it remove the extra layer of complexity that we get with banks.
It does everything a checking account do (but faster, cheaper and globally) without the problems associated with a banking institutions. And then it does more since it’s also smart money (programmable).
Why would anyone want to keep dumb money instead of smart money? How many people still have a dumb phone instead of a smartphone?

@_date: 2018-01-02 01:06:23
Complicated nah, different. It’s no more complicated than switching from iOS to android or vice versa. Bitcoin network has never been hacked, learn to use it properly and you’re safe. If funds get stuck in limbo at least you know what’s happening unlike the banking system.
Credit cards have their own history of being hacked, but when a hack like the Target hack or the Equifax hack it’s your whole identity that is compromised.
So yeah the edges might be a bit rough still but there’s only upside from here.

Bitcoin is money so I don’t have to change it into something it already is. And yes, just to be clear I do all of that with it.
Not everyone is lucky as I am to know so many people that accept it, I get that, but keep in mind a lot of them are people I convinced to make the switch. My next step is to convince my employer to pay me directly in bitcoins, that’s gonna be a bit hard.

@_date: 2018-01-23 03:38:38
All the comments are saying that the IRS is right to crack down on Bitcoin and if they don’t civilization itself would collapse into barbaric slumlords... in my views taxation is one of the last remnant of our barbaric past and getting rid of it would go far to free us from what they call the “establishment “ and further civilization and respect of human rights.

None of my friends own a computer, they do everything with their phone and I’m not going to plug a bitcoin wallet on a public computer, that just sound crazy.
There’s no other chrome extension installed. I’ve download chrome for this purpose only it’s fresh and brand new. I’m not running an antivirus since modern operating systems don’t need them (I’m not using windows).
I’ll be contacting support in the morning as a last resort. Hopefully I’ll get a refund out of it.
It’s very infuriating since I did contact support before buying the product to make sure it was compatible and they assured me I’d have no problems. Very bad experience so far.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:05:00
They are brand new wallets ordered directly from Ledger. I open it up, follow the instructions, but their apps (the chrome extensions) just don’t want to connect to the Ledger, the farthest I’ve been is when they’re asking me if I want a segwit or legacy wallet and it keeps getting unresponsive, asking me to connect the ledger and enter my pin code and it doesn’t matter how often I do it it doesn’t work. I’ve got a recent high end computer and ledger support told me it is compatible and I’ve never had any USB problems with it before.
I’m intermediate to advanced with computers and I just can’t make it work which is the first time in my life I can’t find a solution so I can’t recommend it to anyone. Garbage product.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:41:30
I’ve just received a Ledger Nano S and it doesn’t even work (I ordered two of them and neither will work) so I’m going with trezor now.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:56:04
Yeah hmm no. My buddy had to do just that, his money got stuck in limbo for 3 months with nobody knowing where it was. It finally got thru (minus 12.5% fees) after 3 months and loosing his contract that was time sensitive... hundreds of thousands lost. Same transaction with bitcoin would have cost thousands less and have been cleared in minutes. And you can program in the reimbursement feature if you want it.
Since that he started buying crypto.

A lifetime subscription to a website (I did not have a credit card at the time but I had bitcoin!), I’ve bought many things since then!
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:41:38
With my bank the rare times I do accept or send electronic payments it often takes hours to see the changes reflected, or for me or the other party to get the money, also the limits are ridiculously low (2k a day).  A couple of days ago I made a payment to my credit card and for some reason (probably the holidays) it was post dated to Jan. 3. Then the money of my payment would sometimes appear or disappear on my balance, it’s very hard to keep track of my finances in that situation.
And I’m dealing with one of the biggest, oldest, most respected bank in the country! And I also pay for their premium most expensive account...
So great for you if you have good service, not everyone in the first world has it so I can’t even imagine for the rest of the world, that’s why smart money is the future IMHO.

Are you saying that Bitcoin will stop this consumerism madness and singlehandedly save the planet? While at the same time making sure everyone is getting nice retirements just by hodling into their money? And that in order to make people depart themselves from their hard earned money, entrepreneurs will have to make fucking mind blowing products instead of cheap polluting crap made by abusing people in developing countries?
Sounds like a brilliant idea ��, why don’t you want that again?
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:30:00
If you look at other developed countries you realized that it isn’t that big of a stretch (when it is one at all). For example, look at Canada from 1980 to 1990, it’s economy experienced nearly a 6% annual inflation rate for the whole decade! And that wasn’t that long ago!
The petrodollar as always had a strategic advantage but most fiat money is not that privileged.

Its 95%: 
So making them pay even more is encouraging class warfare. Í´d say to cut almost all taxes and crowd source everything.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:22:35
Saying the “rich will get richer”, doesn’t change anything since they are already getting richer.
Once equilibrium is reached I don’t think we’ll ever see 20% deflation per year, we’re seeing numbers like this right now only because we’re in a phase of fast adoption. In the future I’m expecting 1-4% with maybe 6% deflation for record breaking years we’re the economy exploded.
So yeah if you’re an entrepreneur looking to make 10% more per year it’s still worth the risk.
And yes we will all have to get used to get pay cut, it’s actually a fucking brilliant idea. Right now inflation makes my salary worth less and less and I have to go fight to just stay at the same level, in this new system I get the fat end of the stick and now my employer has to fight to pay me less. It’s empowering the poor against the rich.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:54:18
1 million isn't that far fetch actually, supply is extremely limited, at the next halving in 3 years it will be cut in half. Since the value of the network is the square of the participants assuming we keep the same number of participant in the game and in 3 years we will have a 100k bitcoin, and 4 years latter a 1 million bitcoin, that's assuming the number of people entering the network and exiting it stays stable. All data show that it will likely grow. Right now almost nobody's in the game, I predict a 1 million bitcoin within 5 years with 80% certainty. in 10 years? 100 millions.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:10:05
It would be new territory for sure, and it would require a high level of “enlightenment” (for lack of a better term) from the masses to go thru the slowdown. But I think they are the one who ultimately have the most to gain from it.
If that currency is bitcoin it would not be a “true” deflationary currency in the sens that currency is gradually destroyed, it would be a low inflation currency for a little while until the last Satoshi is mined and then it would be a limited supply currency. At that point why would it’s value grow if it is not because the economy has grown?
I am in no way an expert, but I don’t see why the rate of “deflation” or increase in value of the currency would be any different from the growth of the GDP.

It sounds more like a slippery slope. As you say yourself, it would eventually reach equilibrium, at that point we can build a solid economy based on savings instead of a weak economy based on debt.

In 5 Minutes: The Bitcoin
A currency about to change the world of finances?
Speculative bubble? Alternative Economy? Experimental bank from the mafia and for fiscal evasion?
Recently, a lot of traditional businesses and on-line website announced starting accepting payments in bitcoins, so much so that the financial regulators and governments of the world are starting to look into it. In 2013, the incredible rise of this cryptocurrency reach pics of values, showing a impressive dynamic. Which is also worrying.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
What is a bitcoin?
Currency and a decentralized payment protocol without a central authority. Created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonyme).
How are bitcoins created?
Their creation is manage by an informatics algorithm programmed to generated on a regular basis and at a slower and slower rate the bitcoins.
This mechanism is secured by a cryptographic procedure called the proof of work.
HOW TO OBTAIN SOME BITCOINS?
On the Market
By buying them on a marketplace like MtGox, Bitstamp or Bitcoin-central. The bitcoins are then stored on a digital wallet with its associated unique bitcoin address.
By mining
The bitcoins are distributed for solving proof of work, which are complex mathematic equations.
By giving processing power to the network, which mean by continuously running an open source software to secure the transactions on the network.
Transfer of bitcoins
When a transaction is done a electronic signature (a key) is incorporated in a bloc of transactions (a group of recent transactions).
Every single computer of the network must verify a part of the bloc of transactions to verify that the user really posses the bitcoins.
Saving the transaction
Once authentified by the network, the electronic transaction is secured and the electronic signature is anonymously and forever saved on the network.

@_date: 2017-08-12 22:30:34
Bitcoin has been designed to be self stabilizing: every ~4 years bitcoin's inflation is cut by half that means that we're much closer to a stable economy than people realize, there's only 5 millions coins left to be mined in the next century!
Also if you look at bitcoin volatility over time you will notice that it has only went down. You might think that today it is volatile, but the old folks here remember when it was 100x more volatile than today.

Fellow Canadian here. If you're just starting to think about it all the website will have fairly low limits. It will take a few weeks to get them up and pass the approval process.
The other way is to buy from somebody on local bitcoin or to go to an ATM but the fees for both of those are insanely high. If your in Montreal head over to the bitcoin embassy they may have other idea.

When you buy and sell from an ATM it's anonymous, some people don't mind the fee just because of that.
Also I've been lucky in the past going to an ATM, and meeting someone there and ending up buying or selling to that person ! No fees and anonymous!

Sure there's a lot of "prominent" economists that would say that but that's a fallacy called appeal to authority.
The problem is that when governments "ease" the access to capital it misallocate it to unproductive part of the economy, making the recession even worse.
I don't really have the time to give a university class on this, specially since others have made a much better job at this on this forum and outside of it but I'll give you this as a starting point:

NN is a solution in search of a problem, a lot like RV funding fake transactions on the legacy chain to drive fees up and come up with his own solution; BCH. People who favour NN are like BCH chills, they see a fake problem and want a fast, not thought thru, solution (like increasing the block size). Works short term at our expense long term.
Bitcoin is all about decentralized governance that’s what attracted me to it back in 2013, this is the first time I see this sub cheering for more centralized governance, it’s the first time I’m scared for the future of bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s governance model has nothing democratic to it. 
Direct democracy need 50% +1 to make a change... our modern “representative“ democracies will elect leaders with less than 50% of the popular vote (here in Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau came into power with barely more than 30% of the popular vote).
By contrast you need a supermajority to affect any change on the bitcoin network and the consent of every participant.

Not really, you seem to not appreciate the old nodes contributions to their right value, you seem to see them as a useless nuisance.
You’re half right, they aren’t as valuable at validating transactions as modern ones but I happen to value them even more than modern nodes, why you might ask? They are the guardians of our governing consensus rules and that’s has more value than financial transactions. If this experiment is successful it will disrupt society at an 100x order of magnitude than bitcoin’s disruption of financial markets.
And that’s old nodes greatest contributions.
But there’s more. They allow the network to try other solutions than just Segwit, if everybody was moving to Segwit we would cut ourselves options.

Purse is a website where they allow you to buy amazon stuff by betting on discounted gift cards that people buy and resell on purse to get BTC. I think it’s really complicated and not for everyone at all, but you can get 10-25% off on everything if you’re willing to put up with the overhead.

It's kinda like with linux (well it's actually a form of linux...), the OS is wonderful but seriously, nothing work with it.
Plus I'm one of the few guys out there that really like small screen, and their's no flagship android phone with a small screen... If the iPhone 6 is going to have a larger screen I think the 5S will be my phone for a really long time (currently with the 5).

Deflation is good for everyone, especially in the long term because it will turn the system from a consumption system (ours, which is economically flawed and impossible to sustain) to a production system (where the real wealth come from). I know most of the people like you think inflation is good but that's bad rhetoric, it's only propaganda taught by the state "educational system" to advantage a few. Every good currency is limited in supply. If you want to know more about sound economics you can go towards fee.org and learnliberty.org
