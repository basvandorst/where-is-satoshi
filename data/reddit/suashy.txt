Estimated 10% but the actual supply is less than bitcoin due to many people not redeeming bch, especially coinbase users. The actual value would be much less, expect a dump as soon as coinbase releases it due to the supply influx.

Which is ~100gb btw

Will likely be more cost effective to buy bitcoin directly than investing in mining
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:52:48
Its divisible to many places, so simply smaller units would be used rather than increasing the total supply

What site is that?

@_date: 2017-11-30 01:23:48

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:29:06

To those reminiscing about $5 coins and such, hope that you will miss $300 more. Here is to the future!

I knew this was a possibility but I was looking more into something I could check and see the value. Something along the lines of the iOS app coincap.
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:53:17
I was hoping there would be some app already made where it was more automatic.
