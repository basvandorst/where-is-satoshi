All we can do is hope for the best lol. But yea, I still have hope for bitcoin! Considering the amount of people that still in the industry, I think Bitcoin will hold on.

Maybe, but Exchanges are not really honest themselves. Here's an article about how they try to manipulate markets : [
I'd stick to my "charlatan" P2P sites. thank you.

Yeah! And I found this article on why Africa is so into Bitcoin. [

I have relatives in Nigeria and told them about Paxful. They have been using it ever since and so far they had no problems. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:53:39
Yeah I heard about the Poloneix issue, that must have sucked. Anyway! I'm using a p2p website called Paxful \(which is my wallet also\). Personally, they're great with payment options and customer service. Check it out!

Low trading volumes and ridiculous fees, why would I bother?
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:49:05
This is terrible... Just like their UI/UX design. TBH, I still don't know why people use their site.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:50:57
Neat article and nice recommendations! I also found this video about Bitcoins for beginners that helped me a lot [ Btw, what do you think about Paxful? I'm using it now and satisfied with their service. Was a bit surprised that Paxful isn't on the list. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:40:26
Again, maybe. But still, I'm not comfortable with the fact that they CAN manipulate it makes me uncomfy. I'd choose my p2p as I'm used to it.
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:52:31
Neat article! When I was searching for mining infos, I stumbled on this video that helped me understand mining. You can check it out here [
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:47:14
Bitq seems to charge fees on every move you make? lol
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:49:12
 It's not gonna be long when mainstream/major companies would hop on Bitcoin, mostly taking advantage of it lol.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:30:26
I get that it is decentralized, but it's the amount of fees I need to pay I'm uncomfortable with. I was using LocalBitcoins before but now they require an ID to transact. Now, I am trading using Paxful and so far it hasn't failed any of my transactions. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:43:16
Nice. It's great to see Paxful users on this site. How long are you been with Paxful??
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:25:42
I thought abt the same thing lol but anyway I hope bitcoin continues to go up
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:56:28
I lost my breath reading this. Though, I agree on this generally. Cryptocurrrencies hold so much potential for us and the next generations. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:38:15
Hey! I've been on P2P sites since the start of my Bitcoin journey and I guess I'm satisfied! I love the idea of I'm trading with different people. you just have to be careful though. I was on Localbitcoins before but since they had this KYC rule, it just didn't work for me, and let's not forget about their   
poor customer service. I'm using Paxful now and it's great. The amount of payment options available is a bliss. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:20:04
BISQ might not have the KYC rule but it has high fees and its hard to use!!! I find Paxful better as it offers numerous payment options. I get to use my Itunes gift cards to buy bitcoins which is neat.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:49:21
"*Bitcoin doesn't work* ***exactly*** *how* ***I*** *want it to be, therefore cryptocurrency useless!*" You have the resources, you have the ways to do want to you want to happen, just do it and stop complaining 
@_date: 2018-06-22 04:52:29
That's great to hear from a local there! What other businesses are you into?
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:37:47
I don't know much but I guess it's because of the benefits of using blockchain as it removes intermediaries (like Paypal, banks, etc..)  in the process. It allows you to directly transact.
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:50:11
He (Ray) was shocked of the amount of the Nigerians that are into bitcoins! This just proves that for them, Bitcoin is something that holds potential and it's awesome they are being involved with it. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:21:08
This was actually covered the interview of  Finance Magnates to Paxful's CEO, Ray, [here]( Great article and the podcast is nice to listen to.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:50:26
But with their currently situation, I won't really trust coinbase with anything right now tbh
@_date: 2018-06-22 04:42:11
IKR!!  I've been watching/listening to some of his podcasts and dude he's an inspiration 
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:13:25
That's nothing new, I used to be blocked on their twitter when I was asking simple questions. They seem to suffer from a lot of 'technical' difficulties. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:13:08
If you are into trading, P2P platforms would suit your needs better.
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:16:30


complaints. yea. Coinbase's poor subreddit is BOMBARDED with complaints.  
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:18:17
