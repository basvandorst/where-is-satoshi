So, if you use a credit union that doesn't have reach like BoA, often

Also, unless I'm misunderstanding, this has nothing to do with the transaction malleability issue that stopped withdrawals. 
Basically, they have a shitty system that doesn't take Bitcoin rules into account, but it's always been that way and it still is now.

The only pool that it matters for is GHash.IO, which isn't in the supported list.
Also, supporting getblocktemplate doesn't necessarily result in decentralized mining clients through verified pools. There is no concept of a fault-resistant mining client that inspects the template to prevent 51% attacks. There is no client currently that is able to choose by some criteria which transactions to include in the block to be submitted.

Fucking great. I thought I had moved all my coins to cold storage, but apparently I had 455 LTC there. UGH.

Software engineer, agree with this guy. I have a friend that works at Google, Microsoft, etc. 300k/yr is for specialties (NYC hedge fund, robotics, x86 assembly, etc). NOT btc forum software.

As a developer, yes. It's not just about accepting Bitcoin payments, it's about integrating Bitcoin payments into an existing, sometimes monolithic payment system. 
Also, It gets significantly more complicated if you don't want to use a Bitcoin service to process your payments.

Thanks, I saw one or two ideas I'd like to implement for myself.

This exactly. Every exchange likely keeps upwards of 90% of their user's bitcoins in cold storage for security reasons. A mass withdraw would be processed eventually, but a lot of delays due to cold storage moves would happen.

I checked all over the site but could not find payment options.
Does vultr accept bitcoin?

Sounds good, I'm still waiting on my (never going to arrive) 60GH/s unit from BFL.
My worker name is "MisterMcDuck" (using short name).

No. Difficulty is not a function of price. While the crash may result in less investment towards bitcoin machines, it is still profitable to mine BTC so anyone still holding a bitcoin mining machine will still mine.

This seems like BS/FUD more than anything else. 
There are plenty of tech-savvy bitcoin users, but there was no discussion about how the API is prone to attack. Does he mean by brute forcing? The API key is 32 bytes long. Even without anti-hammer protection, I'd be very surprised if anyone actually was able to find a key via brute force over the internet. 
If not by brute force, then Coinbase's API isn't prone to attack. Users are prone to exposing their API key and having their funds stolen. This is true with every service that provides a private key API system. 
Also, where are these reports that people have had their API key used to steal funds? I admit that I don't browse this subreddit constantly, but I imagine that'd be big news.

Short and sweet:
There are multiple cryptographic algorithms at play with bitcoin, but they all have alternative algorithms that would be relatively straightforward to switch to if serious doubt were cast upon the algorithms currently in place.

I agree with this. It sounds like the paypal rep didn't care. Probably playing solitaire during the pauses.

FYI, there is an underlying framework for individual miners to choose which transactions to include that's being used in existing pools ([GetBlockTemplate]( The miners and pools have to support the functionality, and there hasn't been a lot of push for that since most miners are currently unable to intelligently decide which transactions are included (and don't care to).

The difficulty of mining bitcoins increases or decreases with the amount of time it took to mine the last 2016 blocks, not the amount of bitcoins, which is 25 until around 2017 when it will halve.
I think that's what you were trying to say, but I was a bit confused so I thought I'd clarify for anyone else reading. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:53:51
Nope, encrypted and/or cold storage. 
I'm less worried about keygens etc (since i'd run them sandboxed or in a VM) than zero day attacks. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 00:57:29
I'm also curious, as I've heard the number as quite a bit higher. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:28:56
Downvoted for my first thought, and the only reasonable explanation. Pretty good
