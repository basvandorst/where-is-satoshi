I'm kinda relieved by your response, given your previously brutal assessments...!
Maybe we should have tried meowlance.com with a logo of a cat :)
If you'd promote and support us that would be great. Thanks

 We'll be posting some more official announcements very soon, but hopefully you don't think Moneo.io is too bad!
We've spent the past two months working with 100+ clients and freelancers to build a product that works.  The site and payment system has been 15 months in the making.
Any feedback is welcome ;)

There are definitely a lot of freelancers getting paid in Bitcoin, and we conducted a survey of about 50 blockchain freelancers to validate that. The most common services are technical / development.
Graphic design / creative work is also popular, I guess (for us) it depends on how we position ourselves.
If you're interested, check out our site:

I think it's a case of personal preference, and (so far) freelancers seem to be happy, and we're getting good people on our site.
We've done a lot of research, conducted a lot of surveys (spoken to 90+ blockchain developers, startup founders, lead developers, etc.).  The name hasn't come up as an issue, in fact general comments have been very good.
If we fail, it will because we fail to execute properly.  I think $3k would be better spent acquiring customers at this stage (which is what we're doing).
If we started to get a lot of feedback that our brand / site was cheap, then of course we'd do something about it (almost everything you see is a result of learning from customers).
BTW,  is a good place to generate names (if you have patience) and get them for a few dollars...
