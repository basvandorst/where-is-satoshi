Cpyprocapital has been payment processor for cex for like 2 months now.
I believe they use their services to avoid problems with banks.
Now it is cryptocapital's task to take care about bank related stuff and cex only uses their services.
I don't see any reason for concern about this.
I trade with cex on BTC/EUR market with similar volumes and I haven't had any problems with deposits and withdrawals. Only my first fiat withdrawal took over 2 weeks due to some additional identity verification but it happened long time ago.

They don't seem cheap to me these times.
If an exchange sends 2000 withdrawals a day within 2000 transactions then with 2 inputs per each transaction they waste 2000×180×2 bytes of data daily which with 0,0007 BTC/kB fee costs them 0,0007×2000×0,18×2=0,504 BTC paid on fees for inputs daily.
While if they processed it within batches of 20 withdrawals per transaction then they would have paid only 0,0007×(2000/20)×0,18×2=0,0252 BTC fee paid for inputs daily.
That is a very significant difference.
It is also not so much about people but rather about services which work with bitcoin. They should implement solutions for batching withdrawal requests.
