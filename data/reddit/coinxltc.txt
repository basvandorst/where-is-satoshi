True both are to blame. But the community as well.
They publicly announced their partnership and the new system. Everyone with a technical understanding who read the announcement/faq should have seen this obvious flaw in their "security" system.
It is really hard to understand why this wasn't discussed here or on bitcointalk.

Trolling? Did you even read a single link I posted?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:47:04
If BitGo signs their transactions it can't be a cold storage. BitGo only has one multi-sig wallet system (check their website). The posts clearly says that they replaced their system with BitGo's solution.
Reminds me of Mark K. who accessed the cold storage via a firewall. We all know how that ended.

Great project but Bitfinex should not be given any multisig keys. What m-n multisig does the 2WP of RSK use? EDIT: Apparently n/2 of n. Still Companies that have been hacked should not be given any keys.

I am afraid that this will happen more offen. Bitcoin attracks a Lot of scumbags from the fraud scene. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:30:44
The most likely possibility is that the bitfinex server were hacked and false signing requests were sent to Bitgo.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:07:06
Bitfinex has all user deposits in 2-2 multisig adresses (2 keys are needed to move funds). 1 key has Bitfinex, 1 key has BitGo.
If an user initiates a withdrawal Bitfinex signs the transaction and sends it to BitGo so that they can sign the transaction.
So if someone gets access to Bitfinex's servers he can sign a transaction with the Bitfinex key and then send the transaction to BitGo. BitGo doesn't know that it is the hacker who requested the withdrawal and signs the transaction. -&gt; Funds gone.
There is the chance that Bitfinex used some hardware tool (yubikey or RSA SecurID) to authenticate signing requests with BitGo. But this highly unlikely since this would require some human interaction and no bitfinex employee would allow such high withdrawals.

How does the routing work? How does node A knows that B has an open channel to C which has an open channel to D?
@_date: 2016-04-05 20:09:48
Thanks for your explanation. But how does FoodMarket know who to send the tx to? I guess that when I open a channel they store my ip address, what happens if I change it? Does the wallet contacts all channels on start up an authenticates itself?
And one point I never understood, why didn't cause this any blockchain tx (besides opening/closing)? How can I spend the received 1 BTC without the blockchain providing prove that I received it?

I am happy with cinfu. Good prices, good locations, fast support and haven't had any issues with the server yet.
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:58:56
This sounds all great but if people can do 100 of 100 multisig tx with the size of a normal tx, they cheaply attack a nodes resources. Not sure how fast Schnorr verification is but I am sorry that a block full of 100 of 100 ms txs takes a while to process.

Good work. Just a small fix: copay has 4 fee levels plus a custom fee setting. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:07:19
I very much like that decision. I would not trust a third party to watch the blockchain for me.
So only the person that initiates the channel is "allowed" to announce? Otherwise the other node could simply announce the channel and my decision not to announce doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:04:06
Thanks for the explanation. What is the current sync interval for channels/fees? Does it differ from implementation to implementation or specified in BOLT?
Could it be a solution to "outsource" the routing to nodes that you have a channel with? The client simply asks all connected nodes what routing to x would costs and picks the cheapest one. This way the end user doesn't need to store the state of network and doesn't need to be updated about everyone's fees. 
99% of nodes won't be useful nodes anyway (only online when needed, few channels, low capacity and probably many one way channels).
You could also not broadcast and store nodes that have only one-way channel from themselves to other nodes (like Eclair Android wallet). 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:22:49

My facts were never wrong, other than yours. My Post was just not about svp mining in general, just about Antpool beeing a dangerous Pool. 
You wouldn't blame a person who is bashing isis But is not mentioning al-quedia. 
Besides, btcnugget! = btcc and they didn't not Put thousands of svp users at risk. If all other pools would have done propper validation Checks, no one would have cared about some shitty Pool producing invalid blocks.  That is the Beauty of bitcoin,  at least in theory. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:13:17
All chinese miners already set it to 0. So this change is natural but it should be changed for relaying as well. Otherwise it will bloat the mempool.
Change doesn't mean fee will be the only factor in the future. There is some talk about using deltas.

There are too many people building services on top of the blockchain and not enough building the infrastructure for it. Services like This are way too early and will be one reasons why bitcoin will fail. The blockchain is Not able to handle thousends of txs per second on-chain. The blockchain should  only be used for settlements and high value txs.
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:01:28
People are forgetting that a malicious miner could fill up his Blocks with transactions which take a long time to verify. This causes all other miners to waste hashing Power, while verifying. Since the malicious miner collects the Fee He can Do it for free and as soon as 20mb Blocks are allowed. 
20 mb blocks open the door to spammers and malicious miners to destroy bitcoin.

So why 20 mb? 20 mb blocks are a joke compared to visas transaction Volume.
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:26:02
Not talking about UTXO. And general prunning is not very useful for the network. Somebody has to keep the full blockchain. If you use a prunning node  with 20 mb blocks full of spam a 80gb prunning node would only store a transactions/block for a month -&gt; prunning nodes would become useless.

I haven't seen blocks with free tx by Antpool/F2pool in a while:
General topic discussed by the devs:
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:44:44
For all who didn't read through the whole Thread:
F2pool Operator said that they won't be able to handle 20 MB Blocks and that pools by asic manufactures (Antpool, bw Pool) will take over the network. 
By his calculations 20mb Blocks will cause a 1% orphan increase.
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:58:23
So what is the node telling peers asking for blocks now?
"Don't have blocks?"
Scenario pruned:
1. Node receives a new block
2. Sends out an inv (new block) messages to all peers
3. Peers reply with getdata (block id) messages
4. Node sends block (block) message
There must be a return message if a node doesn't have a block already implemented (asking for invalid block range). Prunning nodes code use the same reply for getblocks request they can't fulfil.

See my reply above.
What a Bad actor would gain?
Damaging bitcoins reputation or destroy it at all. Some actors have more to gain if bitcoin fails. It is false to assume that all actors want to profit from bitcoin. The argument that even a malicious miner doesn't want bitcoin to fail is naive and dangerous. Mike Hearn and gavin use this argument a lot...
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:07:28
It is a strange coincidence that it has happened a couple of times to chinese pools. Since there are 1-2 tx per second it is quite unlikely that they didn't receive any transaction between the old and new block.
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:16:11

Time to get rid of free and dust transactions.
This could also be UTXO spam. With the current network policy you can basicly increase the amount of RAM needed by 68 MB per month at no cost. On the other hand this costs node operators (only RAM costs) ~ 2805$ per month (0.006875$*68MB**6000). These numbers aren't that dramatic but they don't have to be.
Besides getting ride of free transactions at al, devs reintroduce the rule that outputs need to larger than 0.01 for free transactions.

But great stuff you are doing. Lets hope that pools do not implement full Rbf.
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:38:42
3 things to consider: 
1. Maybe there isn't a malicious miner on the network yet. But they will surely come.
2. With 1mb Blocks there is barely an advantage. With 20mb blocks this advantage is multiplied by 20.
3. There could already be some behaivor like This on the network, But it is Hard to detect. 
A lot of users tend to think way to naive. Just because an attack isn't happining right now, doesn't mean it won't. Bitcoin will be attacked all possible ways over the next years (fraudster, Trolls, banks, goverments, altcoin devs...)

I do not agree. What service to pruning nodes actually provide? Sure they do validation but having 10k nodes doing validation does not make the network more stable than having just 1k.
What is import to have full nodes that provide nodes that have been offline for a while and SPV wallets with blocks (headers)/transactions. Pruning nodes only help users that they online all the time but most users start their client occasionally.

You say that most trades don't need to be hedged since they are internally matched. This seems highly unlikely if you consider the volume (800m) and 15 different markets. 
So you need to convert customers bitcoin to fiat and hold with the LPs. This could become very expensive for you if the bitcoin price rises and the user wants to cash out.
Since you have no fees and apparently no extra market spread I don't how you recoup your costs.
Your costs: BTC-&gt;Fiat, LP fees, Hedging against Bitcoin price rise + server/staff

They are just there to increase the the number of BU nodes. They are counted as BU nodes on sites like coin.dance.

This isn't and will never be the reality. If this is the requirement that bitcoin stays limited to a small group of techies.

Wow, the UI is awesome. I think the best I have seen so far.
There is only one thing I don't like. It features dollar too much. Everything is dollar on default (transactions, balance, send, receive). Would be nice to have bitcoin as default currency. Tapping is not stored. 
Great app, but you barely notice that it is about bitcoin.

You are wrong with your fourth argument. Just because it isn't happening at the moment doesn't mean it won't happen. Happened my times in the past.
There have been many more attacks in the past/present. And they are almost at no costs since there is always some shitty pool that accepts spam/non-standart txs.
I am not against the increase but we need to improve the anti-spam rules first.

That is definitely not true:

He was just over optimistic. No reason being a dick @_date: 2017-02-09 23:35:29
Not sure how you calculated the number but I guess that it is based on the assumption that the majority of the people does one open and one close transaction per month.
So we are comparing 1000 tx/s (on-chain scalling) with millions of transactions per second (lightning) while keeping bitcoin nodes decentralised.
@_date: 2017-02-12 20:40:45
True. Most of the merged code is cherry picked from Core without proper referencing. The BU commit history is a mess.
The only upside is that the more BU diverges from core the harder it is to copy from core.
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:35:44
Good job coinfloor. I don't expect much from Bitstamp but I hope Kraken steps up their game. @_date: 2017-02-09 08:13:10
BU is no long-term solution. Lighting is the only way to achieve 1000 or more transactions per second. 
With BU you would need 333 MB blocks with leads 1,4 TB blockchain growth every month. There is no way CPU/SSD producer can keep up with that. Only a few centralized nodes would exists.

Can anyone explain why Chinese pools still produce 0-tx blocks even if the previously block was mined in china? I still see 0-tx blocks that were mined 1 minute after the previous block. With the recent improvement to the verification and creation of block in core it shouldn't take longer than a few seconds. And I can't image that a blocks need almost a minute to pass through Matts Fast Relay Network.
Seems to me like Chinese miners are doing it intentionally.

Thanks to the fiber network, blocks are relayed to all participants in less than a second. Block validation with core 0.14 takes much less than a second. 
So every empty block mined more than 2 seconds after the previous block is intentional or due to gross incompetence.

I am 100% sure long term all pools will stay/switch back to core. There is no way that the 2-3 BU devs can keep up with the quality of Core which is developed by 15-20 people.
And since the BU codebase differs more and more from Core I highly doubt that they are able to merge all core commits.
But it will probably take a year till the pools realise that 0.12.1 is outdated.

The problem is that large tx take longer to verify than expected and could be used to ddos nodes / increase the orphan rate. 20mb won't help with that. They given even more space to large tx.

There are mechanism that you don't have to do that (watching the network). And they work pretty well. Haven't heard of a single successful double spend attempt against bitpay,coinbase or gocoin. The only danger is Peter Todd talking miners who don't understand full-RBF into using it. Kind a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
There barely is any use for fee bumping. Even during the spam attack everyone of my tx got confirmed within 2 blocks. The only Problem are clients with poor fee settings or non at all. And that is a Problem of the client and not of the network/bitcoin. If all clients would use the bitcoin core fee policy there wouldn't be any stuck tx.

Haven't seen any good techical repsonses to technincal arguments against the raise. All responses are ideological (bitcoins should be for everyone) or are about the mooresche/nielsen law.

How is that possible?  I thought the isdust check prevents from relaying /mining outputs that cost more than they are Worth. Attacker send 0.00001 outputs, so even above the Minimum of 546 sat.
@_date: 2015-08-01 09:24:25
It is not trivial at all. Check the recent pull requests. There is a major discussion going on how to do it right. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 11:50:24
no it is not. Mempool is full of tx, downloading a block through the relay network should take lass than a second and verifiying as well. So there is a gab of 2 seconds between receiving the header and having the full block. SPV mining is no explanation for the large amount of empty blocks.
Besides AntPool mined the block before. I doubt that getblocktample takes that long.
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:05:32
But these transaction have no use. What is the point of transaction that are worth less than a cent and are not related colored coins? This is pure spam to damage Bitcoin.

Sadly you won't be able to spend these till the backlog clears. Wondering how much tx bitcoin core/other clients can handle.

They stay in the mempool till the client is restarted. 
Yeah upvote the post that is based an two misconceptions.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:45:30
Full-RBF means that zero confirmations are dead. With smarter fee calculation algorithms, FSS-RBF and CPFP there is no need for full-RBF. It damages bitcoin badly. We give up zero confirmation payments so that a few users that didn't pay a proper fee save a few cents getting there tx unstuck. 
With the coming block size raise i doubt that there will be any stuck tx. If there should be FSS-RBF and CPFP are totally fine.  
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:56:40
Good question. Standard bitcoin core doesn't relay/mine tx with outputs smaller than 564 satoshis. Some node operators and miners must have lowered the number to enable Spam.
@_date: 2015-07-01 00:16:40
This is regarding the UTXO database. All unspent outputs are stored in RAM.






-&gt; 756 MB, an attacker could easily double that number per year.

Warned about them two weeks ago:

@_date: 2015-07-15 16:30:17
Wow that is bad. Coinbase/bitpay don't even check if the fee is High enough to get mined. I thought that is the first thing they do and that this triggers "wait for one conf. " 
This is not an argument for full Rbf, just a proove of bitpay/coinbaises incompetence. 
Pinging and I hope the two biggest bitcoin companies release a statement how this could happen (not thinking about relay policy != mining policy)
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:07:12
He still has to pay few 100k $.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:30:08
984 vs 10k -&gt; proves my point (I know that some spv clients also send less than 0.0001(needs to change))
What do you mean with half a cent? 0.0001 is 2,6 cents.
I wouldn't consider bloating the blockchain/mempool and wasting nodes bandwith for a bucks a desaster but a thing that needss to change. Especially since the change is easy and wouldn't hurt anyone.
To quote Peter Todd:


I don't get why this pull wasn't merged:
Basically everyone was in favor except Jeff.
I doubt that anyone really thinks the price will go above 1000$ anytime soon (10 cents fee per tx).
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:03:23
0.00001 per 1kb, with 20 mb blocks you only need 28.8 bitcoin to fill blocks a whole day. Sure most real transactions would go through since users can easily pay 0.0001 but you also need to consider the load for nodes. A lot of nodes/block explorer already struggeled today. We don't need to make the situation worse by allowing cheap spamming.
I really don't know why most redditors and some core devs are so reluctant to fight spam.
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:09:40
minrelaytxfee=0.0001 (the old minimum before Mike lowered it)
limitfreerelay=0 (no free tx at all)
Works also with all 0.9.x/10.x versions. But you should update to 0.11 anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:39:58

Sadly not possible. This wasn't sarcasm
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:49:39
Not it is not. Intercharge fees are 0.23% + € 0.02 per tx (EU) (doesnt include assement and payment provider fees).
0.00001 is less than a cent. Even with 0.0001 it is cheaper.
EDIT: Mastercard US:
1.58% + 0.10$

Lets hope they successful before this report was leaked (wonder what employee is that stupid).
Quite a few questionable security policies:
* No live monitoring of the hot wallet (most coins were stolen because of deposits after the first drain)
* No 2FA for server access
* Employees open attachments from strangers on work computers that are crucial to security
* Apparently macros are enable on default in word (not even Microsoft recommends that)
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:36:02
With 260 bytes per tx and average block size of 900 he would need ~ 498456 tx.
Fees: 498456*0.00034513 = 171 BTC
Outputs: 498456*0.00002 = 10 BTC
So ~ 48k USD/24h.
With the Litecoin spam fix and a minimum fee of 0.0001 BTC he would have to pay 73k USD/24h. Seems still very cheap.
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:16:19
You only need 1.5 bitcoin to send 144000 tx daily. Very cheap for a person who is trying to make a point or wants to destroy bitcoin.

I like Peter Todd's approach. Half of the nodes using this patch, half of the nodes not. Prevents Tor users from being kicked out and prevents attackers from blocking the entire network with fake tor connections.

Do you see Visa processing transactions for free? Or transactions that have less value than a cent?
Do you really think this transactions have any use to bitcoin? This is obviously a spam attack (has nothing to do with luke's gambling blacklist).
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:58:05
Well it is a trade-off. How many people use 0 confirmation payments and how many have their tx stuck if there is no spam attack going on? All vs very few. 
With Full-rbf you basically make everyone to wait for multiple confirmations on every tx instead of making a few users that were too stupid/cheap to pay the right fee for a few blocks.

@_date: 2015-07-11 18:42:04
I haven't said any false things but besides that I totally agree with ferroh's posts.
1. 1 block is not enough, block can be orphaned and you don't know witch tx is in the "real" block. So you need to wait for multiple blocks. 
2. There is a difference between "no need" and "no use". I never said that full-RBF has no use. I said because of better alternatives and the negative consequences on 0 confirmation payments there is no need for it.

This change is completely useless. There is only a very small number of people that benefit from this: people that are too cheap to pay a proper fee when blocks are full. This can be fixed with FSS RBF.
I think opt-in RBF is just the start, we will have full RBF within a year and Peter finally succeeded his mission to kill 0-conf-tx.
I his latest pull Peter wants to make opt-in-rbf the default for all tx. If this gets merged and adopted by other other wallets, it will make bitcoin payments very book. Say good by to instant payments and say hello to waiting up to 1 hour.

This would solve the 8 MB block size issue, but what is practical max block size now? 3.4 MB? I never understood why the original block weight limit was 4 MB.

Where did you get that number?

Great project, but you should really mention that people need to forward port 8333. Otherwise they will hurt the network with these servers. 
2-3% discount for bitcoin payments would be nice (paypal fee/risk).
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:01:51
Ok, saying it keeps spam tx is wrong. I was trying to point out the difference to the bitcoin core approach:
Which tries to keep all regular tx and rejects all spam tx.
The Bitcoin XT approach could be exploited for double spending attacks. The attacker spams the network with cheap (0.00001 fee) txs and hopes that the original tx gets kicked out of the miners mempool. Then his double spend tx gets into the block.
@_date: 2015-10-08 09:17:53
Time to make minrelaytxfee=0.0001 a default setting
@_date: 2015-10-08 08:47:34
Yeah, thanks for writing this. The dev guide is the best ressource for anyone who wants to get a deeper understanding of bitcoin. 
Btw: who is paying for your work at bitcoin.org? Theymos?
Hope you got compensated well by 21 ;)
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:59:53
Don't let spam tx in the mempool at all. Never had any problems with proper relay settings. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 18:42:13
The current spam tx pay 0.00001 per Kb. I filter out all tx with fees smaller than 0.0001
@_date: 2016-05-21 05:59:43
A warning that this transaction can easily bei double spend would be enough for the moment. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:53:12
Why is the transaction so large?  3 Kb seems a lot for 1 input and one output. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:53:40
Fees will drop as soon as people start lightning. Just way till wealthier people/gamblers opened their channels. This will take pressure of the chain.

@_date: 2015-10-07 21:09:34
For all node operators that use a higher minrelaytxrelay (0.0001) setting: use the latest bitcoin core version from Github. Peter's rolling bloom filter patch will save you a lot of bandwidth. Otherwise your client redownloads every rejected transaction from all connected peers with default settings.
BTW: A bitcoin xt node with default settings would have kicked out a lot standard tx's by regular users and kept the cheap spam tx...
Checked my nodes: ~ 500 txs in mempool (limitfreerelay=0, minrelaytxfee=0.0001)
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:30:25

Bitcoin Core kicks out the transactions with the lowest fees.
I remember that Bitcoin XT used to randomly choose transactions. Not sure it still applies.
No idea what Classic und Unlimited do.

You need to notify the Bundesbank if you receive / send transfers over 12,500€ from / to foreign accounts. It is only for statistical purposes. The IRS (Finanzamt) is not involved. 
Not reporting is only a misdemeanor.
You should get a lawyer. There seems to be a overreach and obvious misconduct by the police.

So two people (including him) voted for an increase who gives a fuck. Bitcoin.com is a joke as a news site. As is Roger ver. I wish he would leave and join the ethereum community till they get sick of him and pass him to the steem community.

Yes. One of the few left. I prefer a private western mining compancy that supports the community with donations and researches any time over a public chinese mining pool any time.

This is bad (sad) news.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:42:45
Interesting that some investors didn't trust the miners after segwit was locked-in. They waited till segwit was active before investing.
Looks like some some people expected some foul play.
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:23:28
Kraken uses Vogogo too. Why do they need a middle man? Why not directly accept wire transfers like bitfinex or like they Do in the us and europe. 
Also interesting that Vogogo is shutting it down.  To much fraud?  Pressure from banks?

Why does Kraken allow that 2FA can be set for funding only? If you can remove it with the password this more than useless. It is dangerous. They should reimburse you.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:33:04
Also it confuses new users and shows instability. Will we now have a new ethereum with every fork?

I don't get why this is Coinbase's fault? If they send a tx with 100 Ether and polo credits 100 ETC and 100 ETH coinbase doesn't loose any ether.
How can you prevent that the tx gets relayed in both networks?
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:25:35
You can't be serious. You really don't see the problem with offering 2FA for withdrawals that can be turned off with just the password? 
This is some serious incompetence. I have always defended Kraken against criticism but this ends today.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:44:26
But an attacker could create 4 MB blocks?
@_date: 2016-07-25 00:09:42
What the fuck are you talking about?
1. There are serious issues with the other Chinese pools (SVP mining, full rbf activation, accidental hard fork, poor connectivity, block withholding).
2. The major issue is that no country should have 70-80% of the mining power. At moment it is China. If it would be the UK, I would advise to stay away from UK pools
This has nothing to do with racism. Please inform yourself about the risks of the Chinese mining cartel before posting BS.
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:58:01
Time for a new favorite block explorer. I will not support the chinese mining cartel.

The downside is that he stopped selling his awesome hardware node. The site is redirecting to 21.co.
I doubt anyone will buy a 21.co computer just to run a node.
Luckily there is bitseed.org

Similar to a debit card. If I understood correctly the channel can be refunded if exchanges support lightning channels.
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:05:35
Thanks for the summary. Not sure what impact the regulation will have.
I hope they don't consider Bitpay a wallet provider since Copay uses their API? 
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:26:48
Good to see that coinbase is finally improving their merchant service.
But how is coinbase able to offer btc and usd price based refunds? 
Either they sell the overpaid coins when they are received then they have to pay extra if the merchant choose to refund the original btc amount and the bitcoin prices increased meantime. -&gt; The exploiter doesn't lose money
Or they keep them and then they have to pay extra when merchant chooses to refund the original USD amount and the bitcoin price decreased in the meantime. -&gt; In this case the exploiter profits
Seems to me like a serious issue that can be exploited by malicious merchants:
1. Overpay
2. Wait till the prices increases or decreases
2. (a) If decrease choose USD based refund and get more BTC back than you paid
2. (b) If increase choose BTC based refund and receive the same amount of BTC back.
3. Enjoy risk free shorting.
@_date: 2016-07-25 00:46:53
Ethereum Classic is the DAO attackers only chance to monetize his stolen funds. So I highly doubt he is behind this.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:54:46
This is not true. Even with lightning and sidechains this will Not be enough to open and close channels when bitcoin hits mainstream. The current concern is that a 2 mb limit combined with segwit is pratically a ~4 mb limit. That is why the devs want see first that the 1.7 MB segwit limits works fine and till the block relay is improved (changed to udp).
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:21:04
Yeah not sure why he even wastes one second with these lunatics. The are obviously immune to facts and logic.

No I pointed out that you allow users to set the funding option without setting the login option. 
There needs to be a check in your code for proper settings. It doesn't matter how intuitive or clear it is there will always be users that will use it wrong as long as you allow it. 
Strongly disappointed inwho I always thought of the most competent person in the exchange biz.

Why are the Binaries build with minupnp activated?
@_date: 2016-07-31 17:46:56
Segwit will probably come with 0.13.1. So if the 0.13 release works without any problems we can expect miner voting soon. 
But some pools (f2pool, antpool) will probably need months to "test" segwit.
So I expect segwit to bei active at the end of the year. 
Don't blame the core devs,  blame the incompetent chinese pools (except btcc).
@_date: 2016-07-20 01:11:16
No one should use this wallet.

@_date: 2016-07-26 06:45:23
You don't need to set 2FA for login. That is the problem. This way users think they are safe if they just set it for funding. Which they would be if Kraken would require 2FA for the removal of 2FA. 
They should never allow users to set 2FA just on funding. 
The system is very conterintuitive and you need to read several support articles to understand how the system works.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:34:34
This! People seem to overlook that bitmain obviously wants to prevent segwit2x. 
They even say that they have patent concers regarding segwit so why would they activate segwit2x? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:38:22
Segwit2x nodes will reject non segwit signaling blocks starting 1. august. Core nodes do not do that. So they will build on invlid blocks. I would not call that compatible.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:42:02
Are the peers changed if they perform poorly (invalid blocks / slow)?
EDIT: Peers that send invalid compact blocks are banned.

Nice to see some positive feedback. Kraken has been getting a lot of heat recently.
I know their UI is one of the worst in the biz and they have some support problems but people are forgetting that Kraken is the oldest exchange that has not been hacked. That should be worth something. I happily accept a few flaws if they stay unhacked.
I think Kraken is the most trustworthy exchange and jesse does an awesome job.

Wow that is bad. A company forces their policy onto a subreddit.
I don't see the problem with theymos. People would don't feel they can freely speak should go to r/btc, r/bitcoinxt, or start a new subreddit.
Every subreddit has his on removal policy. For example is more leftish and likes to remove posts that don't fit in the political view while is the opposite. That is the nature of reddit.
We should be thankful that theymos prevents this subreddit from becoming a pool of hate and FUD like @_date: 2017-06-14 07:41:04

Also they use uasf as an excuse to torpedo segwit2x. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:49:57
Segwit2x will reject blocks that don't signal Segwit readiness. You said it yourself.
Core doesn't not reject these blocks. So Core miners may build on a block that segwit2x miners reject.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:12:40
Segwit2x uses bip148. If Segwit2x activates before august how will they be able to tell the difference between bip148 and segwit2x miners? Both reject non segwit blocks.
