If the government treats it like a stock, wash trading is actually 100% illegal.  Like, federal "pound me in the ass" prison illegal.

The volume on okex specifically, or also the volume on the other exchanges the article you linked references and implies do not have much fake volume?

In order to believe that the price is going to go up and you're going to make lots of money, don't you also have to believe in the potential of bitcoin?  If you just thought it had no potential it seems like the logical conclusion would be that you're not likely to make money by investing.

I'd like a source for that claim.  Off the top of my head I can think of at least one recent high profile case where they convicted someone that I bet you've already heard of.

You're surmising he's some sort of weird dick eating contortionist?

Easy mode: Second sentence.  At the very least if you're making this claim, you should be able to link to some statistics about their conviction track record.
Hard mode: Last sentence.

It doesn't matter how you personally believe it should be classified, it matters whether it's being used in a way that falls under trading regulations that you haven't read.

That article simply doesn't claim what you claimed, and based on your "90% wash trading" claim I don't even believe you know what a wash trade is.

Actually, it was unrelated to the 2008 crisis or Madoff, as a more intelligent person might have reckoned by my use of the word "recent," but...  In the case you mentioned, who do you believe violated exactly what law?  Or, if you think the law isn't adequate for prosecuting one or more of these people, how do you believe the regulations should be improved?  
It's odd to me that you think there should be a large enough number of recent high profile cases such that the average person would be aware of quite a few of them and suspect that a stranger on the internet also knows about it.  It's not like we just have high profile people openly and blatantly violating these laws in a way that's easy to identify and prosecute.
