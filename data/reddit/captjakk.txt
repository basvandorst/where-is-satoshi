When I dabbled with alt trading it definitely felt like gambling, with skill you can improve odds but not by enough to make it not gambling. Long term investment is different though in my opinion.

Right but not if goods and services are paid for with bitcoin. When people stop accepting dollars for things because they prefer bitcoin or something else it causes the dollar to lose utility and therefore be devalued. I’m aware that it doesn’t disappear but it does become less useful.

The trouble is that as the ratio of buyers to sellers tips heavily in favor of buyers the buyers. And as savings gets poured into it and out of the dollar, that CAN not necessarily will, kick off a spiral. The good news is because we have a number of other financial instruments that the government is ok with people buying, It seems unlikely that they will react poorly to this. And the fact that there’s a consistent circle jerk in this sub about the price of bitcoin in dollars, that indicates to me that a number of people are still just trying to get fiat rich. So yeah, for now it seems unlikely that the dollar will spiral but history has a damning trend.

The reason to HODL is not for profit. It is for abandoning government fiat Monopoly money in favor of honest democratically enforced monetary policy. As such prices declining should be as meaningless as prices rising.

100k yes, no doubt. 1M is likely too high in today’s dollars. From then it will come down to how much grace the fed has in dealing with it. Capital flight is a 2 for one. As people are buying crypto they are also selling fiat and driving the price down. The fed may compound this by trying to inflate their way out of the problem which will only accelerate the process. But if BTC captures half the global gold market alone it will be worth ~150k in today’s dollars.

This is a strawman. Every technology is built implicitly with that assumption. Assumption of possibility of success is a prerequisite to invention. It also does not affect the properties you try to design for as the properties themselves stand on their own. Finally, Bitcoin’s antifragile design is probably the design that assumes the most hostile environment around its existence.
So unless you’re trolling this claim is irrelevant at best and wildly off base at worst.

Legality only matters if you choose to follow the law. Like all forms of consensus you choose whether or not to fork off of the protocol or follow the rules. If the government criminalizes it you can be sure that there will be a sort of virtual cesession from the us governing rules. This will ultimately accelerate the pace Towards the terminal state of governments losing credibility and collapsing. If they’re smart they’ll retain “authority” by only passing laws that people wanted to follow anyway. If they aren’t then you’ll have to make the choice of freedom or submission. The choice is obvious to me.

It is also important to be able to do securities trading in a decentralized way. Many (all?) ICO's today are probably worthless, but the concept of being able to issue securities is an important innovation in finance that allows capital to be unlocked in ways that otherwise wouldn't be. This ends up being important because investment is an accelerator for wealth creation. Currently, Bitcoin is focused on fixing money, which it should be, but other forms of disintermediating finance will still be important going forward. Remember, banks/gov'ts don't JUST have a stranglehold on money, but also equities, debts, and derivatives markets. It will be important to disintermediate it all in the long run, things like CoCo's are a step in that direction that should be welcomed by the Bitcoin community.

I mean this should be obvious right? Any asset that is trivially tradeable gets about a 20% price premium just for being liquid. Crypto brings unprecedented liquidity to asset trading of any kind. So it stands to reason that if you took every asset class today (already trillions of dollars) and then give it the 20% liquidity bump, that we would easily exceed trillions of dollars...
The simplest financial product in existence is SoV, then currency. After we tokenize debts, equities, real assets, derivatives, etc. You're talking 10's of trillions. Not to mention the capital flight will cause the USD to plummet which will mean that by the time its all said and done it'll be way more than trillions due to an accelerating devaluation of fiat currency.
I view "cryptocurrency" as equivalent to the economy itself at this point. No idea how much share bitcoin will retain over time, but crypto will likely subsume all asset classes in existence for the sole purpose of making assets liquid.

Fee prices are a measurement of how urgently people want to move their coins. This may be related to price volatility but also may not be. If and when volatility stabilizes, the need for large numbers of on chain transactions that are all happening at the same time will go down. That said by the time we get there the adoption may be high enough that steady usage may still eat up the level of on chain space.
Imagine the following scenario: let’s make up numbers for ease of explanation, let’s say each block holds 100 tx. So the fees will be 0 until the 101st tx. After that what matters is the price elasticity of the cost of moving money. If each one of those tx was so urgent that it was worth 10btc to be included in the next block. The fees would be 10btc per tx . 
The urgency of moving this money is in my opinion more due to market volatility than to market price. As volatility declines so will the fees. Together with off chain solutions and capacity increases, it’s very feasible (and necessary) to have channel open and close fees be affordable.
Note: as I understand it it has never been Cores position to Prohibit capacity increases. But with nonlinear scaling solutions already under Dev, it is at the bottom of their list as far as preferred ways to scale bitcoin. If it is 100% necessary to do a modest capacity increase to get adoption over the “finish line” then I’m sure it won’t be a tremendous issue. The main problem is that if that’s your only solution (aka Ver and BCH) then you’ll lose decentralization along the way to full adoption for sure.

Counterfeiting means that there are copies in the money supply. I am just tired of people who misunderstand how the system works stating wrong premises and then drawing wrong conclusions in such a way that newcomers see that and hen turn around and propagate that information. I’m not claiming you’re spreading disinformation, just misinformation.
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:33:11
You clearly misunderstand bitcoin and are trying to apply incomplete definitions that don’t map one to one with the old financial system. It’s people like you that cause further misunderstanding by other people who take your incomplete definition and mistakenly try to apply it outside of what is true. So no I’m not going to shut up. If coins are double spent, there are still no counterfeit coins in the economy, it’s just that they ended up in a different place than you thought. If you wanna take a legacy financial concept it’s a payment reversal, not a counterfeit.

I was around back then and the only people who were pushing 2x were larger bitcoin businesses. Pretty much all the users that wanted larger block sizes forked off in Aug’17 with BCash, everyone left didn’t want larger block sizes. When it became clear that the users would reject it, the NYA was called off, since neither businesses nor miners control consensus, the nodes do, which were mostly run by end users.
I also doubt that the deal going through would have changed the dynamics of segwit adoption. Remember segwit activation is a consensus change that merely required a sufficient number of nodes to upgrade due to it being a soft fork. Segwit adoption OTOH requires changes to every Wallet’s address generation and transaction signing code. The NYA was about activation, not adoption. And since adoption is substantially more work with very little benefit to some of these players, it was not prioritized.
As someone who has had to write address generation and transaction signing code for a bitcoin startup before I understand the nuance of this problem a little better than the average user. The issue is that segwit is quite complicated (and clever!). If you want to get a taste for the level of effort involved in understanding and implementing it, take a look at bip144. So consider the incentives of the businesses here. Today, fees are palatable, so from a cost reduction perspective Segwit adoption is marginal (not useless, but benefits are small). Also any business that had an MVP that existed before the existence of segwit, necessarily did not need it to continue operating, so from a revenue generation standpoint, it was not important either. The only products for which this was not true are systems that required malleability to be fixed, which pretty much no one needs except lightning right now (I may be wrong on this one).
All that together leads to an incentive structure where existing businesses have it on their “someday” roadmap rather than imminently. Stack that on top of the fact that most bitcoin companies are still startups and not profitable means they cannot afford to spend a lot of Dev cycles (expensive) to get marginal gains to their product. Net new bitcoin companies don’t have this problem because they don’t have sunk costs into their addrgen and transaction signing code yet, so they just start with segwit from the getgo.
Finally, it goes without saying that there are still some players in the space who may be acting in bad faith, but I’d argue that it isn’t as prevalent as the conspiracies suggest. The NYA was more likely a sign of cluelessness than malice. They simply didn’t know they couldn’t do what they were trying to do, and they wanted to do what businessmen do to solve problems, shake hands and make deals. Now those of us who build for a living know that isn’t how it gets done, and Bitcoin is an especially weird beast here that everyone was learning for the first time just how the levers of power work here (including us as users I might add).
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:56:04
Correct. And they are leasing the space to other companies, so it won’t really be in their control even when it is full.

51% attacks do not counterfeit bitcoin. They reverse history and can in some limited sense steal bitcoin. Stop spreading misinformation.
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:44:22
I apologize for the harshness. It’s just that rampant misinformation is having a real negative effect on the space right now in the form of regulation that is poorly thought through and makes assumptions that don’t hold true.
As with everything these thing come down to definitions. If you limit your definition of counterfeiting to “producing a fake” and you then apply it to the coins themselves, that is false at worst and misleading at best. If you were to instead apply it to a transaction, it would be more true however the issue is that transactions are a “use once only” sort of deal. This does not map onto the old system. If you counterfeit a bill, it can continue to be used, thus inflating the supply of money. If you “counterfeit” a bitcoin transaction, you can at best get free products or services, but the receiver of your counterfeit cannot further propagate that “money”. 
So yes in a highly specific and literal sense it can generously be named a counterfeit transaction, I am just highly sensitive to the connotation that gives to people who are less familiar with the system. It causes a sort of mania where everyone loses their shit, and then the regulators make rules that snuffs out the builders who are making cool shit.

The flip side here though is that if places like Coinbase gauge you too hard. It’s not difficult for that market inefficiency to be resolves. I am actually happy the barrier to entry is lowering.

@_date: 2018-06-09 16:55:14
In your original comment you said “Outside of a 51% attack you cannot counterfeit Bitcoin”. So while your last comment did more subtly convey the difference, the comment I reacted to originally very strongly implied the currency itself. So we’re probably in agreement here, I’d just ask you to be more cautious about how you phrase things and realize they have ramifications beyond what may immediately be obvious. I’m dealing with this firsthand at work right now where people’s secondhand poor misunderstandings are causing a lot of unnecessary pain.

I don’t think you understand what “market manipulation” means. Unlike with alts there is very few if any individuals in the world capable of putting a ceiling on bitcoin prices through manipulation. There are too many markets. The most probable reason is due to tax season and people trying to sell enough to afford their tax bills from last year, the rest is just weak hands panicking.
