I just gave you the math.

Of course, 87k USD is just an arbitrary number that I have chosen to demonstrate my point as it is the current USD amount of block reward, so I used this amount as the minimal USD amount of block reward in the future needed to guarantee a high enough hashrate. In fact a much bigger hashrate will be needed as all of us assume the price per 1 BTC will be higher, thus the security needed will have to be higher.
My point is not that if the fees are 20 USD per transaction the 2nd layer scaling will up the slack - thats obvious. My point is that we will have to pay at least 20 USD on onchain transactions in order to  give miners the same USD value incentive they have today to secure the network. And thats bad as 20 USD is a huge fee and I dont see any other solution, do you?
Well sure, your last paragraph is the reply in lines with "idk, hopefully we will come to some magical solution", which is a possibility but not something that gives much confidence.

what does it matter that there are billions more users in the future when the block space enables only approx 4200 transactions in one block? In the case of 5 cents tx the block reward purely from tx fees would be 4200 x 0,05 = 210 USD per block, which is way below the current huge 87k USD block reward.
Please read the question asked before answering or calling someone dumb, thanks.

how does that help? It makes it even worse afaik. The higher the price per BTC, the bigger the reward for attacking the network, thus a bigger hashrate than now is needed, meaning a bigger USD reward per block mined is needed. Meaning users paying more than the current (arbitrary) number of 87k USD per block reward is needed, meaning more than a 20 USD per transaction fee. Shitty situation.

I see, so we dont really have a solution to this so far. Thats what I feared.
