Getting rich quick involves a lot of risk.  If you have a high degree of risk tolerance then go for it, I guess.  But there is a very significant chance you'll get burned.  
The reason people tell you not to invest what you can't afford to lose is. . . you may very well lose it.  
without regard to speaking on the tax implications - why on earth anyone would risk their downpayment on anything as unstable as bitcoin on a house is beyond me.  But everyone has their own tolerance levels.

Everyone operates on imperfect information.  But the difference between speculation and investing is - investing contemplates building growth and value over time.  Speculation is hoping that someone else will value the item more than you.  SEC regulates stock markets.  That means - there is no hiding the ball.  Financial reports are public.  Any event that could have a material impact on the value of the company must be disclosed - by law.  And the reason for this is - yes, in the bad old days, a shit load of scams did happen.  Then the 1933 and 1934 Securities Exchange Acts were past - to prevent the scam artists form taking advantage of unsophisticated investors.  There's also a shitton of State bluesky laws that also layer on top of this to prevent scams.  When financial reporting was deemed insufficient in wake of Enron, they passed a whole bunch of new accounting regulations in Sarbanes Oxley that require even higher levels of compliance and certifications of financial reports by CFOs and CEOs ON PENALTY OF JAIL that they records are accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge.  This is the reason that there is a huge amount of trust in the stock market the the investments measure in the TRILLIONS of dollars.  
Get your head out of your ass.  Investing in Stocks and speculating in Bitcoin ain't even the same thing.  Not by a zillion miles.

Re: "volatility affects only short term"

Try to play on-line poker.
If the government ends up viewing bitcoin as a threat that can't be tolerated, they can make it damned difficult to interact with actual monetary systems.  I'm sure there could always be end-arounds for the highly technically proficient.  
But its utility for most users could be greatly diminished.  And it very well could end up being relegated to a relatively small number of users willing to engage in subterfuge or get around US laws or overseas users in countries that don't view bitcoin as a threat.  
That may mean it continues on in some form, but it is certainly not the path to widespread acceptability that the absolutely insane valuations are predicated on.

Need to distinguish between a. regulations to control, b. regulations that effectively are bans, and c. outright bans.   US government has several legitimate concerns:  ability to trade anonymously and hide transactions, ability to launder money, ability to evade taxes, ability to engage in otherwise illegal activities.  To the extent those things can be regulated, they will be.  To the extent they can't, if the threat is big enough, then look for regulations that are bans or outright bans on the apparatus that allows interaction with main economy.  
As for taxes, there's way more concern than employment taxes - every transaction is a taxable event.  If you buy a pizza and pay for it with bitcoin that gained value, then you owe capital gains tax.  If at a loss then it can be used of offset gains.  Either way it has to be recorded and reported.  
I don't know what to tell y'all, but bitcoin is never going to be a global currency.  It simply isn't useful in the way that currencies are useful.  It's closest analogue is a commodity - it's a digital commodity.

JFC. . .This is stupid AF.
Currency isn't an "investment".  Not one single financial professional would advise you to put your retirement or savings (beyond a small amount of cash to have on hand) in dollars.  Put it in stocks or bonds depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.  You can invest it in something that generates income and might appreciate, like real estate.  
You have dollars on hand to buy shit - and maybe for emergencies.  It happens to be really useful for that.  A lot easier than saying "I'll trade you three shares of Apple for that. . . whatever."
The measure the desirability of bitcoin as an "investment" against all the tens of thousands of investment options other than USD.  And think of it like what it is - a digitized commodity.  It doesn't generate any cashflow.  Period.  Full stop.  The only value as an "investment" is whether someone will pay more for it than you did when you go to sell.   If you're a gambler and like to flip commodities for a living - then measure bitcoin against pork bellies, or orange juice, or oil, or copper. . .

Worth reading to the last few paragraphs: 
Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news.
She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, “Cinemark, the best seats in town.” She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn’t support her.
“Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,” she said. "And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.”
She found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this.
“And maybe I’m going to lose it,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.”
She had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.

That wasn't a statement of a feeling.  You don't.

But we took the time to build that up, saved a little bit at a time, put it into investments that were long term stable.  Didn't get there fast.  But got there.  Now our mortgage is way less than rent would be and we gain equity in the house with each payment and uptick in real estate.

Start with - buying bitcoin isn't an investment at all. It's speculation.  There is no cashflow from bitcoin, no intrinsic value.  Whether you are positive or negative only depends on what someone else will pay for bitcoin when you go to sell.  It's a digitized commodity. 
Second.  It's duplicable.  Blockchain has some utility, but it can be duplicated easily (and already has been countless times).  Bitcoin's sole advantage is - it got there a little ahead of everyone else - so it has a bit more utility because of network effects.  
Third.  It's useless for most things that currency is useful for.  It can be a store of value (big deal, there are tens of thousands of stores of value).  It's main utility are threats:  Ability to make illegal purchases anonymously.  Ability to evade taxation.  Ability to move large sums of wealth more or less instantaneously without having to go through the banking system and adhering to lots of pesky rules about knowing your customer.   Ability to launder tainted cash.  
A large amount of our security is predicated on making large transfers by bad guys difficult.  These are not hypothetical threats BTW - criminal enterprises from tax evasion, to arms sales, to terrorist activities have been brought down or halted because of controls on the banking system.  This is a very good thing - and the nations of the world won't allow for a wide-spread system that allows this to be evaded.  At the very least, controls will be put on that make transfers traceable and give the government control over freezing and confiscating bitcoin when needed.  This will undermine much, if not any, advantage bitcoin actually offers.  What's left will be. . .nerd money.  Kinda neat, not particularly useful, limited to a small percentage of the population that has no real use for it because state currencies work fine in most of the developed world.  
Finally - the recent run-up is almost certainly the product of irrational exuberance.  The coyote can only run so far off the edge of the cliff before he realizes there is no more ground underneath him.

The Greater Fool
Late last year a number of us were warning that Bitcoin was an obvious bubble.  Those warnings were routinely dismissed (you don't understand the technology! but the blockchain! there are only 21 Million coins, blah blah blah, etc etc etc).
As soon as we said this is LIKE Tulips, or Beanie Babies or other speculative bubbles with no real foundation in value we were greeted with endless drivel about how it this couldn't possibly be like Tulips (tulips are flowers you fucking moron) or Beanie Babies (this is a distributive ledger, not stuffed animals).  
All of that was quite besides the point and completely missed how it was like those speculative bubbles - which ALL work in exactly the same way on the way up when emotion takes over and there is always a greater fool, driving the price even further. . .and that momentum itself creates greater fools.  
And they all end the same way - they run out of fools.  Eventually the idiots at the top are the ones stuck, and the whole thing collapses.  Has nothing to do with the underlying asset is - that's just the MaGuffin.  It could literally be anything, Tulips, Beanie Babies. . .digital chits. . .
Anyway, the rest is history, it's now 1/3rds ATH headed to 1/4 ATH. . .
Could this give away all gains in the last 12 months?  You bet.  
Could this take years to build back any confidence - undeniably it will. 
Could something happen in those next couple of years that drive it to nothing?  Maybe more likely than not.
That's not to say, don't play this game - if you have fun - do it!  Just make sure you're playing with Monopoly money.  Money that you literally do not need for any reason at all - and wouldn't care if it disappeared.  
This is a lottery ticket.  You may make some money, probably not, only use mad money and you'll be fine.

You say things like "bitcoin is digital gold" without understanding what gold is.  That's my issue.  It's total bullshit.
A bitcoin costs roughly 5X what an ounce of gold costs.  IDK about you, but I work hard for my money, and I'm not going to buy something that costs 5X what an ounce of gold costs without getting something for it.
Now - I might spend that on a lavish vacation and enjoy the fuck out of that.  I might spend it on a used car and get some use out of it. I might buy my wife a really nice present and get a happy wife/happy life return.  I might spend it on a few shares of Apple as in investment - and the only reason I would do so is because I hope to get a return on that investment.
Now sell me a bitcoin.  I can't eat it.  I can't wear it.  I can't do anything with it that I can already do with money.  It doesn't give me pleasure to own. I can't display it for all to see.  
So why would I own bitcoin?  Because it's innovative? fuck you.  I'm not spending 5X what an ounce of gold costs because its fucking innovative.  
Because it's not part of the banking system?  Please, I'm not a fucking sex or drug trafficker.  The banking system suits me just fine.
Because of network effects?  You've got to be fucking kidding me. 
The only reason I would buy a bitcoin is because I think the price is going higher.  That's it.  Convince me the price is going higher and I'm in.  Otherwise it's as useful as a beanie baby to me.  
So it had a good run, and there's enough true believers out there who still think this is some kind of game changer.   But everything bitcoin does (or actually doesn't do because, let's face it, there's still lots of problems here) the banking system has figured out a long fucking time ago. 
But it is useful for illicit trade - money laundering, black market stuff.  I'll give you that.
Other than that. . . it's about the furthest thing from gold you can imagine.

This headline is so fucking stupid.
1.  Not a myth.
2.  It didn't involve everyone doesn't mean it didn't involve investors.  Just like bitcoin, only a relatively small number of nerds have bought into this nonsense.  That doesn't mean the consequences to them aren't very significant.
3. The overall economic repercussions were minor.  As the repercussions of the bitcoin bubble crash have almost no impact to the overall economy.  Bitcoin is a just non-player in terms of overall world economy.
Here's what's not a myth:
1.  Merchants did engage in a tulip trade which commanded fantastic prices for a short period of time.
2. The market did ultimately collapse when they ran out of greater fools.

There's about 27,000,000,000 worth of bitcoin already mined.
10,000,000 is .037%
So no, there is no measurable impact on supply by mining.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:28:43
That's ridiculous - the overall supply isn't impacted that much by mining.  Over 80% has already been totally mined and only a teensy tiny fragment of a percent is added any day.  Virtually all bitcoin will be mined by 2040.
The impact on supply of mining is effectively zero.

"Bitcoin has similar characteristics to gold in that over time the people that hold onto it have been rewarded in its appreciation." 
This is so vague as to be a meaningless statement.  What other things have people hold onto have been rewarded?  Please.  
"The fact that bitcoin is a technology that is valuable and gives control to the users and the entire world can participate outside of what their government thinks is a value proposition."  The black market, sex trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, drug trade are the only real value adds here.  
"Bitcoin takes that power away from them."  Nonsense.  Bitcoin is not money.  Repeat that again as many times as you need to to understand. Bitcoin is not money.  It has zero implications on monetary supply.  None. 
Anyway, you're too far bought into this BS to have a productive conversation - so go ahead and believe what you want to believe.  But just know it's a load of nonsense.

That's why I'm going to spend my hard earned money?  You've got to be fucking kidding me - there isn't a 100B dollars investing in bitcoin because of such nonsense.  
"There is also a limited supply". Everything has a fucking limited supply - that's the entire study of economics.  
"why Bitcoin was invented - out of the financial crisis". What problem in the financial crisis does it solve?  
"Now that bitcoin exists, there is competition to the legacy financial system" To what end exactly?  Besides which, it doesn't answer why I'd spend money to own it.

Sorry - y'all keep confusing money with investments.  Money isn't an investment.  You trade with it.  When you want to store it, you convert it - to something else - stocks, bonds, real estate. . .and what you convert it to depends on the level of risk you're willing to accept and the level of returns you are seeking.
Bitcoin isn't, and never will be, an alternative to money.  It's just another commodity that you can convert money too.  And it's a risky as hell one.  So yeah, you can convert it, and maybe you'll see huge returns.
Or maybe it'll lose 2/3rds of its value in 6 months.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:21:46
Another way to think about this is:  why is gold expensive and silver (relatively) cheap? 
They're both noble metals.  Both relatively inert.  Both rare.  Both extracted though similar mining processes.  Both can be smelted and turned into coins and jewelry.  Both are used as stores of value.  Both have some industrial and electronic uses. 
There are actually fewer known reserves for Silver.  So why is silver cheaper? 
Gold is unbelievably beautiful.  It can be made into wondrous and highly sought after adornment.  It has heft - you know it when you hold it in your hands.  Silver is valued too, but it doesn't have that je ne sais quoi that gold has.  Gold is expensive because gold is highly desired - it is highly desired because it can be manufactured into items that people deeply desire.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:27:13
"digital gold"  Nope.  Gold has many industrial uses, and is highly desirable for use in jewelry and other adornment.  
It's digital Beanie Babies.  For the moment, in demand because its tradable and other people will pay money for it - but there's no intrinsic value of use.   
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:05:11
That is simply not true -  2/3rds of mined gold is used for jewelry, electronics, other industrial, and dentistry.  Only 5% goes to central banks.  And 25% to bars and coins (much of which is really in the form of collectibles). 
The vast majority of mined gold is put to use.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:38:12

Anyway, I know what bitcoin is - it's a virtual commodity.  No more, no less.  It's value is only derived from what someone else will pay for it.  What someone else will pay for it is entirely based on what they will believe yet someone else will pay them.  In other words, it's 100% psychology.  
Gold is not psychology.  Gold has a real market.

Ok- I'll try this another way.
Let's say you believe your country's currency is complete shit.  Let's say it actually is complete shit.  
The measure isn't whether bitcoin is a better store of your wealth, it's which of the any of the 1,000s upon 1,000s of other investments are a better store of your wealth.

A Taxonomy of Bitcoin Users
The Techbros (see also The True Believers) - they're really into the internet of everything.  They think analog money is antiquated.  They're digital 24/7 and money should be no exception.  They're huge believers in the future of blockchain and can nerd out in the technology all day long.  Hodlers highly present. Subset of Techbros are the True Believers that think Bitcoin has the power to change the world, right all wrongs, create equality where there is none.
The Criminals - Bitcoin is merely utilitarian.  It allows easy transfer in exchange for contraband.  It provides an avenue of commerce for all kinds of illicit behavior from illegal drugs to sex trafficking to terrorism to money laundering.  
The Day Traders - they're not in it for the tech, they're in it for the rush.  They couldn't care less about blockchain (hell, they might not even understand it). They see a volatile asset that can be exploited for gain.  It could be oranges for all they care - anything that moves this fast can be profited off of if you know how to play the game.
The Hedge Funds - Institutional traders that agglomerate huge sums of capital that can be then used to manipulate markets.  It's a market and they're going to be present because they can move it or because they can manage the risk.  
The Libertarians (see also former Goldbugs, and Trumpkins)- fringy right-wingers that distrust central banks, and really, government of all kinds.  They think money should be deflationary and hate the idea that central banks can "print money" and undermine the value of their cash.  For some reason the idea of storing wealth in other assets that rise in value never occurs to them and they often confuse assets with money. They're highly resentful that trades in bitcoin are taxable events and hold things like "taxes are theft".  The extreme libertarians trade in conspiracy theories about jews and global banking.  In a prior generation they would have been advocating for return to a gold standard - this is the new gold standard to them.  
The Black Hats - Anarchists (left and right) that want to burn the system down.
Aunt Sally - Aunt Sally doesn't know anything about bitcoin really, but she's heard people talking about it and she's curious enough to put some money into it.  Aunt Sally has a lot of questions.  She's a little disappointed in you right now.
FOMOs (see also bandwagonners) - *sigh* these are lambs lead to the slaughter.  They see people around them getting fabulously wealthy instantly and want in.  They tend buy at the steepest part of the chart on the way up, and sell at the steepest part of the chart on the way down.
The Ruskies - Russians are exceptionally adept at identifying any weakness in western hegemony and then driving a wedge into it.  Bitcoin provides yet another avenue to throw a stink bomb into the system.  Their use is purely exploitative.

"bitcoin/crypty will probably be the only thing that's really yours" - so the entire system of personal and real property just what, vanishes?
"so owning some bitcoin seems like the smart thing to do.And since there are almost 8 billion people in the world, all of them will compete with each other for bitcoin which is limited to 21 million or some other crypto, or a centralized digital currency, or maybe none of this actually works out."  Or another better crypto, or another centralized currency, or currencies, or maybe none of this actually works out and people continue to use fiat.  
"can happen long term only if bitcoin is used by only a very small population."  Yeah. . .and if I had to put my money on something it would be just that.  Bitcoin will continue to be used by a very small population.

@_date: 2018-11-23 23:35:02
I can't remember the first time I heard of bitcoin, but I remember last fall was the first time I took a close look at it.  I spent a lot of time that fall watching with interest, then with trepidation, and finally with outright horror at the bloodbath to come. I learned what the hell it was, how it works, what it was useful for, what it wasn't useful for, what were the barriers, where were the potential pitfalls, etc.  I read all the sidebar material, and then article after article, and white paper after white paper.  I looked at youtube videos of people considered the leading authorities in bitcoin.  And I looked at the trading.  I looked at insane rise in price and I saw story after story of people selling assets to purchase bitcoin.  
After processing it all - I identified several red flags and concluded the insane prices were based on psychology and nothing else and that bitcoin was going to crash and crash hard.  
I feel pretty well vindicated a year later.  
Redflag  Bitcoin isn't what most of the promoters say it is.  It isn't a currency.  It isn't even particularly useful as a median of exchange.  There's almost nothing it does that  the traditional banking system doesn't do better. 
Redflag  Bitcoin isn't used for much of anything.  99% of owners simply trade it.  What little use there is in commerce is mostly illicit or symbolic.
Redflag  Bitcoin is a threat to controls on banks and money - a lot of that regulation was for a lot of good reasons.  Those reasons don't evaporate with bitcoin.  I concluded that it is almost near certainty that regulatory crackdowns will prevent the fulfillment of the vision that is promoted.  
Redflag   it is not nearly as secure as the promoters indicate.  There seem to be dozens of ways people can be separated from their bitcoin.  The higher the value, the more likely that is to happen.  Moreover, storage is greatly problematic - a recorded key is hackable or can be stolen.  A memorized key can be lost forever in an unexpected accident.  Exchanges are far from secure.
Redflag  - Tether and Bitfinex are shady AF, almost certainly have contributed to bubble. The chickens haven't come home to roost on that one yet.  
Redflag  - Bitcoin is a paradox.  The idea of a "deflationary" currency isn't a good one - but even if it were, it's completely contradictory.  You don't spend deflationary currency, you hoard it. But if you hoard it, there is no utility.  If there is no utility, then there is no real value.  But if there's no value then the price craters, but if the price craters you should spend it. . .etc.  
Redflag  - it's too volatile to be a good store of value.  Best left to speculators and hedge fund operators.
Redflag  - no one can tell you what the true value is.   There isn't a liquidation value.  
Redflag  - no definitive path to useful transactions. 
Redflag  - the promoters of bitcoin include a lot of people who want to see systems disrupted, governments topple, banks fail, and people have complete freedom to engage in any transaction, even illicit ones, even dangerous ones, out of inference from states.  
Redflag  - Bitcoin is cumbersome.  Every trade is a taxable event.  This is going to complicate tax filings for many users.  For that reason alone I would not expect widespread use for average taxpayers who want to file a 1040ez. That alone will greatly limit reach. 
Edit I'll add a 12th red flag.
Redflag   While the volatility makes it useless as a store of value for most people (who need some degreed of predictability in their savings - they're usually building for something - a house purchase, their kids college tuition, retirement, etc) it is great for is highly sophisticated traders with access to extraordinarily sophisticated tools and analysts who can use superior information to make money.  That's great if you're a shark.  Minnows get destroyed.  Since I'm not a hedge fund and I don't have access to quants, high speed trading equipment, and sophisticated algorithms that can spot arbitrage opportunities, I'm at a huge disadvantage - most ordinary people trading are likewise at a huge disadvantage.  And that doesn't even touch on the ability of large capital to move relatively small markets like this. 
The 10th one is along the lines of "judging you by the company you keep". Not everyone in bitcoin is a nihilist, but nihilism and anarcho-capitalism is definitely a lively strain in the bitcoin community.  
Not much has changed in a year.  It's a little less dangerous as an investment since most of the upward price swing is gone (I still wouldn't recommend it) - but longterm utility to me seems greatly suspect.  
I concluded then and maintain now that bitcoin is best characterized as a synthetic digital commodity.  Its real utility is almost entirely confined to illicit trade.  And most of the value is derived from speculation.  Unlike actual commodities (metals, pork bellies, oranges, etc.) there isn't an actual consumable product that has a market. That is an inherently unstable condition.  
Not in the business of predicting which way the price will go - in fact, I predict it will continue to swing wildly.  But it won't end up doing anything the promoters say it will do.  And for those reasons, I continue to stay far away.

That . . . is. . .curious. . .framing.  Isn't it? 
The "plunge" is mostly based on psychology and manipulation?  OK, what about the insane runnup in price.
BTW, there's a clear answer to the difference here - you're just not seeing it.  Enron, Worldcom, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Bros weren't commodities, they were companies.  Companies with huge amounts of overhead, liabilities, and debt.  They failed because they couldn't overcome these liabilities - otherwise they would just scale back.
Bitcoin is just a synthetic commodity.  It's always going to have some value.  It won't go to zero.  It may well go to $3000, or $300, or $30, or $3. . .or $0.30 - whatever - at some level it will continue to live on.

It's 80 fucking percent off the high.  Of course it was in a bubble.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:52:45
You are very confused.
Bitcoin's value is wholly unrelated to fees.  There is no "profit" that is generated by bitcoin such that a holder of bitcoin gets a share of. 
It's more like. . .copper.  Copper isn't a company.  Copper doesn't generate profits.  Copper is a commodity.  It is useful.  People need it.  You can buy copper and use it, or you can buy copper and hold it in anticipation that someone else will want it more than you and pay you more for it. 
Of course, unlike copper, bitcoin doesn't have any physical properties.  It has no independent utility.  There's nothing you can make with bitcoin.  You can't admire it for its beauty.  It is an intangible.  Code.  
And it is entirely artificial.  
Bitcoin is an intangible, synthetic, digital commodity.  Because it doesn't actually have any independent utility, any value it has is because the people who own it believe that other people will want to own it more than they do and be willing to pay more money for it.  
At the end of the day, what has driven bitcoin to incredible valuations was for the desire for more fiat.  
Ironic, ain't it.

If Bitcoin can be taken down by a series of blog posts, it's even weaker than I thought (and I think it's pretty weak sauce).  
BTW, worth reading the three posts in the "coordinated assault".   I thought the first one lays out many of the vulnerabilities of bitcoin making it clear that this disrupter technology is extremely vulnerable to disruption.  I also agree with the premise in the third that clever ideas are not necessarily good ones (and bitcoin is a great example of that - in fact, I think it's a very clever and insidiously bad idea).   I've also been fairly certain that a centralized digital currency divorced from the clunkiness, expense and limitations of blockchain has most if not all of the benefits of a digital currency with none of the nefarious downsides.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:10:52
When those of us were pointing out last year that bitcoin was an obvious bubble and dangerous to buy we were shouted down as being obviously ignorant about bitcoin's promise and future.  We were told it's value was 5, 10, 20X the insane run up in price.  We were dismissed as being no-coiners and told repeatedly that we just didn't understand the technology and how revolutionary it was.
Of course, that's the fevor and unjustifiable optimism that accompanies all bubbles.  There's always a reason why this one is different (if you didn't believe that with your heart and soul you'd sell because the signs of bubble were obvious).  
But what we didn't say was - bitcoin has no future, or bitcoin is going to die.  Just that it was absurdly and obviously detached from any justifiable support for the price. 
I think bitcoin will soldier on, the Esperanto of money, a nerdy side-show that attracts a hodgepodge techies, misguided idealists, taxation-is-theft libertarians, nihilists, anarcho-capitalists, the shadowy underworld, and probably dark-op off-book state-sponsored actions that can use it to move resources out of the prying eyes of pesky oversight, but which never gains the traction and widespread use that promoters would have us believe
In the 2007/2008 housing bubble no one thought homes were going to be worthless, just dramatically (and ruinously) lower than the speculative value that had run them up to absurd levels.  
Just as during the 2000 tech bubble when others were warning me that tech stocks were untethered from reality they didn't mean tech was going to disappear, just that the multiples that stocks were trading at were unsupportable.  I had lots of reasons why I believed the tech stocks would hang on.  Well, that was a hard lesson learned. But I learned it - fundamentals matter. 
What I damn well didn't do is make up a bunch of reasons why those who sounded those warnings we actually wrong because not every tech company went bankrupt.

People keep asking what is "bitcoin's fundamental value".
This is an unanswerable question.  There is no "fundamental value" - it's entirely dependent upon the market psychology at any given moment.  It's definitely not like a hard asset that produces a revenue stream.   It's not like a company that makes something and has an EBITDA and growth rate that can be analyzed.  It's not even like a commodity like oranges, or pork bellies, or oil that has an end user consumer and is a market based on demand for the asset itself.  It's not the least bit like gold that has desirable physical properties that make it useful for things.   
The value is only based on what people will pay for it, and they're only deciding what they will pay for it based on what they think they can get for it down the road.  The "value" fluctuates all the time.  
If we had a super computer, and could program it with a zillion variables that determine it's "intrinsic value" almost all of them would change as it approaches that value.  It's a little like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this regard.  
The market for bitcoin is 100% psychology - there are no fundamentals.
Play wisely.

This Bitcoin bubble burst is a fantastic learning opportunity.  People should take advantage of it.  
Somewhere down the line, there's going to be another asset bubble that gets bid up to impossible highs.  It's going to have an evangelist class that spin tail after tail about how the valuations are not only completely justifiable, but actually quite low.  It's going to have a class of folks who got in early enough to make sums of money that defy belief in short order.  It's going to be opaque enough that almost anything is justifiable.  It's going to generate tremendous regret amongst those who didn't get in early.  It's going to create a sense of momentum that seems unstoppable.  It's going to create a mythology that distinguishes it from all previous bubbles.  It's going to generate a huge sense that the world will be divided between those who saw the light and got in, and all the suckers who couldn't understand it and missed out.  Eventually, it's going to attract people who's only interest or understanding in the asset is the ability to ride it up to the moon.  And you'll see people defer debt, and max out credit cards, cash in savings, transfer assets, even mortgage their very homes to get in.  And your Aunt Edna will call and ask what you know about it.  And that's when you know that the whole thing is going to come crashing down.

"You actually trust big banks and people with unlimited money to point out the bad guys for you"
I think the big banks should be broken up because I think too-big-to-fail is dangerous.  But that's a completely separate issue from whether I trust them with my money.  Of course I trust them.  
"You let them play God and trust them when they seize and ban people in seconds."  
Nope - no one plays "god" we have due process.  People's assets can't be seized indiscriminately. 
"but often its just people they dont like or political enemies"

"Jesus are you really naive enough to belive financial establishment will ban the bad guys for you?"  
Banks follow laws, laws that are written by congress, a congress elected by people.  I don't like all the laws, but I follow them, because that's how democracy works.

That isn't a business model - it's an asset bubble - and it's about as stable as beanie babies.  
Profits, generally, are received in dollars. And then reinvested into the company to grow it in form of CapX or R&amp;D or to make more inventory, or distributed in the form of dividends.  When companies do hold onto large amounts of "cash" its actually investments that keep up with or exceed inflation. The other way companies (and shares) become more valuable (and higher share price) has nothing to do with cash flow but relates to the value it creates over time through innovation, or market capture, or efficiency gains, or talent development.  
You've bought into this mythology - but bitcoin itself isn't a business at all - and gains you've seen aren't "profits".

"Store of value is one of the definitions of money."  No, that is not a defining trait -  regardless, you can certain store wealth in money (though it's not a good one).
"Gold is, but dollar isn't money...technically."  Don't know what you mean.  Dollars are money in every regard.  
"If you hold US dollars for 2 years you can lose 5-10% of the value!!!"  The inflation rate for the last 10 years has been between .1% and 3%, averaging less than 2%.  So no - not recently.  And regardless exactly zero people advocate storing significant wealth in dollars.  There are zillions of alternatives.  
"I think bitcoin, like gold has a place in the economic ecology."  So does blackjack for that matter. 
"The dollar does too."  That's good, because, you know, that's how the vast majority of commerce in the US is conducted. 
"I personally think its great to have multiple forms of currency."  Why?  
"I think it's great to have thousands of cyrptos."  Thousands of cryptos that will never be used as currency serves what purpose exactly?

No.  It's trade.  Bitcoin isn't money, it's a digital commodity.  
@_date: 2018-07-13 19:48:53
Not all crypto uses blockchain - but regardless, sophisticated users of crypto can easily anonymize their transactions and move vast sums through TOR.  with Bitcoin you can skip intermediaries and all those pesky "know your customer" laws and headaches of having to be legitimate when using the banking system.  
Using cash is hard (for illegitimate transactions), and gets harder all the time.  Gone are the days of anonymous Swiss numbered bank accounts.  Moving physical cash is logistically challenging.  
In fact, the only real way to monitor bitcoin is when it interacts with the banking system.  Otherwise huge sums of money can be moved anonymously without any interference.  
@_date: 2018-07-15 05:14:45
Society has built a shitload of obstacles to making it more difficult to do this at scale.  The concern is less about street trade and more about the big players who have to move massive amounts of cash. 
This isn't a scare tactic - it's fucking real that bitcoin is going to be used for very nefarious purposes and will facilitate  massive amounts of illicit activity.  You might want to write this off - but people will be hurt, some will die and bad guys will be able to shuttle cash to where they need it with a tiny fraction of the transactional risk that exists today.

ZOMG - if bitcoin craters what will people do if they're forced to hold all their wealth in inflationary currency? 
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:21:38
1.  no.  Inflation is low, not fast.  I know what this is.  And in gambling, you can lose it all in an instant.  
2.  Bitcoin isn't money - it's a digital commodity.  Probably one of the highest risk commodities there is right now.  High risk commodities could go high, or they could lose 2/3rds of their value in a couple of months. . .oh wait. . .that happened.  
I know I'm not forced to participate - I wouldn't go near this toxic stuff with anything other than money I was 100% comfortable with losing.  
I don't think all investing is gambling - lots of safe blue-chip stocks, bonds with guaranteed returns, other instruments backed with guarantees like annuities. . .there's other forms of investment that tend to do well over time (real estate, collectibles in some areas, etc.) - your risk tolerance for bitcoin has to be massively higher than just about anything else (except maybe junk bonds and penny stocks -those are also risky as hell).
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:04:58
I mean, they apply that term, but probably out of affinity for tin hatter wing of the libertarians that have had a hard on for the gold standard since it was eliminated in the 70s.
It's not digital gold either.  Gold has physical properties that make it extremely attractive and useful in certain electronic and industrial processes.  Vast majority of gold is put into use, not stored as bullion.  Certainly some people, institutions and even nations do use it as a store of wealth - that that is far from its only use.
One way in that gold and bitcoin seem similar is it tends to encourage emotional responses to it that inflate its intrinsic value.  I'll give it that.  
That being said, gold is a commodity and what I characterize bitcoin as is a virtual digital commodity.  There is no substance to it - unlike gold or any other commodity, there is no utility, and no aesthetic quality to it that gives it a value.  
In fact, because (for the vast majority of users) there is nothing that bitcoin does that money doesn't already do much better, the only reason why I'd want to purchase a bitcoin with money is because I believe someone else will offer a higher price later.  
The inflationary/deflationary thing is a sideshow.  There's a million investments I can make that aren't subject to inflation.  Sure, I can put my money in bitcoin, I can just as easily (actually, its easier) put it into gold, or pork bellies, or real estate or any number of stocks or bonds.  Or hell, I can buy a CD or put it in a money market account that guarantees not only the deposit, but a rate of return above inflation - try doing that with bitcoin.  
There is one exception to the fact that money does everything bitcoin does but better, and that's if I'm a sophisticated criminal or have a reason to hide my transactions, then bitcoin has some extremely attractive qualities that make it better than money.   
Other than that - the real reason people buy bitcoin is the juice - it's a really really volatile digital commodity - and with a little luck and timing, you can make a lot of money in a hurry that way.  
You can also lose a lot of money.  
And a word to the wise - there are hedge funds out there - hedge funds with billions of dollars in assets that they can deploy with a press of a button - hedge funds that spend vast sums of money hiring mathematical geniuses to scour markets for any arbitrage opportunity - hedge funds that have developed extraordinarily sophisticated models to identify ways to take advantage of the market.  These hedge funds are going to be way way way ahead of your average trader.  And you can bet your bottom dollar that they've identified bitcoin as a market that can be exploited.  
Buyers beware - these waters are filled with sharks.

Money is legal tender, typically the form of coins or notes, but also includes instruments like travelers checks, and also includes demand deposits, other check deposits, and negotiable orders of withdrawal, etc. which in total constitute the supply of the medium of exchange as defined by a government.  Gold is not money unless it is minted in the form of a coin and becomes part of the medium of exchange.  
The Venezuelan Bolivar is clearly money.  
Bitcoin is clearly not money because it is not legal tender.

@_date: 2018-07-14 19:31:23
Use of bitcoin to launder money in the Russian indictment released yesterday:  
COUNT TEN (Conspiracy to Launder Money)
56. Paragraphs 1 through 19, 21 through 49, and 55 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
57. To facilitate the purchase of infrastructure used in their hacking activity—including hacking into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and releasing the stolen documents—the Defendants conspired to launder the equivalent of more than $95,000 through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.
58. Although the Conspirators caused transactions to be conducted in a variety of currencies, including U.S. dollars, they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains, and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity. Many of these payments were companies located in the United States that provided payment processing services to hosting companies, domain registrars, and other vendors both international and domestic. The use of bitcoin allowed the Conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.
59. All bitcoin transactions are added to a public ledger called the Blockchain, but the Blockchain identifies the parties to each transaction only by alpha-numeric identifiers known as bitcoin addresses. To further avoid creating a centralized paper trail of all of their purchases, the Conspirators purchased infrastructure using hundreds of different email accounts, in some cases using a new account for each purchase. The Conspirators used fictitious names and addresses in order to obscure their identities and their links to Russia and the Russian government. For example, the dcleaks.com domain was registered and paid for using the fictitious name “Carrie Feehan” and an address in New York. In some cases, as part of the payment process, the Conspirators provided vendors with nonsensical addresses such as “usa Denver AZ,” “gfhgh ghfhgfh fdgfdg WA,” and “1 2 dwd District of Columbia.”
60. The Conspirators used several dedicated email accounts to track basic bitcoin transaction information and to facilitate bitcoin payments to vendors. One of these dedicated accounts, registered with the username “gfadel47,” received hundreds of bitcoin payment requests from approximately 100 different email accounts. For example, on or about February 1, 2016, the gfadel47 account received the instruction to “[p]lease send exactly 0.026043 bitcoin to” a certain thirty-four character bitcoin address. Shortly thereafter, a transaction matching those exact instructions was added to the Blockchain.
61. On occasion, the Conspirators facilitated bitcoin payments using the same computers that they used to conduct their hacking activity, including to create and send test spearphishing emails.
Additionally, one of these dedicated accounts was used by the Conspirators in or around 2015 to renew the registration of a domain (linuxkrnl.net) encoded in certain X-Agent malware installed on the DNC network.
62. The Conspirators funded the purchase of computer infrastructure for their hacking activity in part by “mining” bitcoin. Individuals and entities can mine bitcoin by allowing their computing power to be used to verify and record payments on the bitcoin public ledger, a service for which they are rewarded with freshly-minted bitcoin. The pool of bitcoin generated from the GRU’s mining activity was used, for example, to pay a Romanian company to register the domain dcleaks.com through a payment processing company located in the United States.
63. In addition to mining bitcoin, the Conspirators acquired bitcoin through a variety of means designed to obscure the origin of the funds. This included purchasing bitcoin through peer-to-peer exchanges, moving funds through other digital currencies, and using pre-paid cards. They also enlisted the assistance of one or more third-party exchangers who facilitated layered transactions through digital currency exchange platforms providing heightened anonymity.
64. The Conspirators used the same funding structure—and in some cases, the very same pool of funds—to purchase key accounts, servers, and domains used in their election-related hacking activity.
a. The bitcoin mining operation that funded the registration payment for dcleaks.com also sent newly-minted bitcoin to a bitcoin address controlled by “Daniel Farell,” the persona that was used to renew the domain linuxkrnl.net. The bitcoin mining operation also funded, through the same bitcoin address, the purchase of servers and domains used in the GRU’s spearphishing operations, including accounts- qooqle.com and account-gooogle.com.
b. On or about March 14, 2016, using funds in a bitcoin address, the Conspirators purchased a VPN account, which they later used to log into the  Twitter account. The remaining funds from that bitcoin address were then used on or about April 28, 2016, to lease a Malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com website.
c. The Conspirators used a different set of fictitious names (including “Ward DeClaur” and “Mike Long”) to send bitcoin to a U.S. company in order to lease a server used to administer X-Tunnel malware implanted on the DCCC and DNC networks, and to lease two servers used to hack the DNC’s cloud network.

"BTW, the dollar doesn't count as money because it's not a good store of value." 
Dude - I defined money for you above.  Here it is again:  
Money is legal tender, typically the form of coins or notes, but also includes instruments like travelers checks, and also includes demand deposits, other check deposits, and negotiable orders of withdrawal, etc. which in total constitute the supply of the medium of exchange as defined by a government. Gold is not money unless it is minted in the form of a coin and becomes part of the medium of exchange.
If you want a store of value - invest money into something - money is for exchanges, it isn't for long term storage of wealth.  
As long as y'all can't figure that out, you'll be totally perplexed about what bitcoin is and isn't.

"When's the last time you used a CD to buy a sofa or a house?"
I use this thing called money to purchase stuff. Its handy - accepted almost everywhere.  I can do stuff with it on-line even!  
"Something that can be used to purchase everyday items, but that is deflationary... pretty attractive."
Why?  
"True international currency (not controlled by any one country or group like the EU)" 
The benefits of this to me being. . . .what exactly? 
"Investment / deflationary"
Money isn't an investment - it's an absurd concept to begin with. If your investment collapses any advantage of being deflationary get wiped out with it.  Hell, it's lost 2/3rds of it's value this year - dollar's looking pretty damn good by comparison. 
"Digital (unlike gold)"
But money is already digital. And converting gold (if that's what you think you need) to $ is as simple as executing a sell order. 
"Can be used to buy everyday items from everyday people."
Money does this right now - and it does it really fucking well.
"My prediction is that bitcoin will stay in the $5,000- $10,000 range for the next few years before slowly edging up to $20,000 and beyond by 2030."  
My prediction is that all predictions on bitcoin are worth the price you paid for them which is bupkis.  The truth is - no one knows what the price of bitcoin will be in two weeks, two years, or two decades - it is 100% market psychology.

"You do realize that if everyone thought that way, we'd have none of the innovations we enjoy today."
That's an absurdity.  I can distinguish between things that advance society and things that can be extraordinarily destructive.
"If a new generation that's been raised in a digital culture embrace Bitcoin, then it will be adopted."
Don't smoke your own supply man.
"It's global and non centralized."
So?  I can use dollars anywhere and even when I can't they're easily convertible.  Transactions are instantaneous and with minimal fees. 
"but it will almost certainly run along side as an alternative currency that is not tied to any one country or region."
I don't dispute that a tiny fraction of overall transactions will continue to happen in nerd bucks.  People still operate ham radio.  Doesn't mean it's all that meaningful in grand scheme of things.
"I fully support Bitcoin and see where it is headed."  
Good for you.
"but as a network security specialist for years, I sometimes also see it as something that is possibly one of the most robust entities to ever come out of mankind's imagination."

Dude - y'all need to drop this delusion.  Crypto isn't money and will never be used as such (except for a relative handful of nerds).
Like, think about this for 10 fucking seconds.  
1.  It's WAY too volatile to ever be currency.  Only a small fraction of people will have the risk tolerance to be in at all. 
2.  Every transaction is a taxable event.  Every. Single. Transaction.  Now you're going to have to transform whole segments of society that fill out a 1040 ez form into 1040 with long schedule Cs - tax headaches for people who make basic wages?  LOL no.
3.  People who hodl bitcoin won't want to spend on the way up (my pizza will be worth 20% more tomorrow!) or the way down (I'll lose 10% if I buy that cupcake).  Either way - this isn't transactional currency.  And that's just for everyday transactions.  Try closing a fucking complicated financing deal with bitcoin?  It would be a fucking nightmare - trust me, I do this for a living.  How are you going to pick a price months out on an asset that can gain or lose as much as 20% in a fucking day?  
4.  It's complicated.  Oh, sure a few nerds will get into it.  Got to think about Aunt Sally.  WTF does Aunt Sally know about hard wallets, soft wallets, cold storage, exchanges, hard forks, soft forks, 51% attacks, lightning network. . .it's going to make her head spin.  You know what Aunt Sally does when her head starts to spin?  That's right she orders a gin and tonic and pays for it with good old fashioned greenbacks.
To be attractive, currency must be stable.  Currency is also (slowly) inflationary for very good reasons.  Y'all need to stop conflating investments with currency - really bad idea, never going to work.  As a practical matter, the only thing people actually do with bitcoin is trade it. 
That and engage in illicit activities - bitcoin will be useful for black markets, human trafficking, terrorism, drug trade. . . that is a useful feature of bitcoin.  Without a doubt illicit acts are bitcoin's killer app, and for that reason alone I predict heavy heavy regulations.
But other than that, the broad population doesn't need it and won't adopt it.

One very key reason why it's not coming back any time soon:
Bitcoin was relatively obscure until last year's run (yeah, I know some of you have been steeped in this stuff for a while) - the vast majority of people first became aware of it as an asset to be traded in the last 12 months.  It developed a brand identity (to the moon) and a mythology (if everyone moves from gold to bitcoin. . .if everyone realizes that cash money is inflationary. . .if everyone realizes the possibilities of bitcoin, yada, yada, yada. . .) that justified not only current insane valuations - but incredibly insane future projections (it's going to 50K, 100K. . .dare I say it? a million someday!!! - Lambos for everyone).  And that was fun for a while.
But it became an obvious bubble.  And the frothier it got, the more insane the mythologizing became and the dumber the money went in.  Stories started circulating of people maxing credit cards, taking second mortgages, deferring payment on student debt. . .bad bad stuff.
Now it's brand is going to be:  "oh yeah, bitcoin, that the thing my buddy lost his life savings on."  "Q: How can you make a small fortune in bitcoin? A: Start with a large one."  Its quickly become a joke, a cautionary tail - right up there with - Tulips, Beanie Babies, Pokemon Cards. . .The branding is horrible now. Throw in the bitfinex/tether scam and there isn't going to be a recovery for this. The longer it stays here, the more sentiment will turn against it - the worse it will get. Forget smart money, even the dumb money is going to stay away for a long time to come.  
Remember, the price is 100% psychology and the sentiment has turned sour.  The true believer level where you might find support is way south of where it is now.

It's 6X the price it was this time last year.  6X is a huge multiple  - what's it based on - a favorable ruling?  A technological breakthrough?  A huge vote of confidence by a world economy? Nope. Nope. Nope.
It's total speculation.  Market psychosis.  FOMO.  
What is the correct market price today?  
No one knows.  Anyone who tells you that they know if a lying liar.   
There's no intrinsic use - there is absolutely nothing to go by to provide any kind of guardrails on it at all.  It could be worth 1 dollar or 10,000. . .no one has any idea.  
What I do know is this - it is wildly subject to manipulation.  There are people making scads of money on pump and dump on bitcoin - play that game at your own peril.  
Because the value is wildly speculative.  Because it it subject to manipulation.  Because you can't actually use it to transact any business and there is absolutely zero path that shows a way to actually conducting business in bitcoin - the entire thing is a house of cards.  
Block chain is interesting and digital currency has great utility.  But bitcoin is a dog with fleas.  When you see the blockchain being used to transfer dollars instantaneously and cheaply, then I'll be a believer in that technology. 
Bitcoin is living on borrowed time.

If she left it in the market, and worked and lived on her earrings and didn't even put away any more savings - On her 28th Birthday she's have $113K - That's a downpayment on a house.
But let's say she says no, she's going to keep it in the market and continue to live on her earnings.  On her 38th Birthday, she's have over 300K.

You realize it's a third of its value since December when those like me were sounding the alarm bells then and laughed at. . .
I don't have to have skin in the game to know a bubble when I see one.  
The value is completely speculative.  It produces no income, it can't be used for anything except trading, it lacks any intrinsic desirability or collectability - no one displays their bitcoin.  
It's only function is trade.  Money is a far superior medium of exchange in every possible way.  As a store of value it ranks up there with junk bonds.  It is superior to currency in exactly one regard - the black market - which makes it extremely vulnerable to regulation by all the major world economies as the threat materializes.  
There will likely be a form of digital currency in the future - it will be run through central banks.  It will not be bitcoin - which one day may have some residual value among the nostalgic and the curious.

I don't have a question.  IRS doesn't have a question.
The only people who have questions are ignorant people new to the concept of being taxed on value from trading assets.  The IRS has a great deal of experience taxing these kinds of transactions whether the property in question is real estate, tangible personal property, intangible securities, commodities, and all manners of collectibles - everything from art to rare coins (which, FTR, do not get treated as tender for the purposes of assessment of taxes on a transfer). 
LOL at all you bitcoin fanboys think that you get some kind of free pass on nerd bucks because you think the IRS can't figure out cyberspace.  
They are way way way way ahead of you - and this isn't some weird grey area of the tax code open to interpretation.   Transactions involving bitcoin are taxable - all of them - unless otherwise specifically excluded from the tax code such as the new basis on death rule that applies to all property.

What function does bitcoin serve?  
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:01:10
The network might possibly have some value down the road - who knows - it isn't actually used for anything right now. 
Down the road, all sorts of other things will also come online - some we can predict, some we can't. Absolutely no one can say with any certainty that bitcoin will thrive, survive or die in that environment.  
The reason I think bitcoin will not succeed as a currency (it may well limp on for years as novelty nerd bucks for a while) or as a store of value is because a.  It's way too volatile to be a store of value, and b. it's far inferior to greenbacks as currency and actually just gets in the way of transactions.   
Eventually the feds will produce a digitized greenback or someone will figure out a way to put dollars in a blockchain and eliminate the unnecessary bitcoin which is only serving as a middleman. 
And I know the libertarians will go. . .but but but but inflation.  
That's stupid AF (for at least a couple of reason) and it displays their complete lack of understanding about money and economies.  First, no one (as a rule) stores their wealth in cash under a mattress.  Interest bearing accounts, money market funds, bonds, stocks, annuities and all sorts of other cash flow producing instruments completely offsets the worry about inflation.  So that's a stupid argument.  Second, deflationary currency is a stupid AF concept to begin with.  Central banks must have the ability to expand or contract money supply to keep economies betwixt the scylla and charybdis.  These libertarian anarcho-capitalist theories are based on a fantasy.

Yes.  Every transaction like this is a taxable event. 
Your bitcoin had a value when you acquired it.  That is your basis.  It had a value when you disposed of it.  The difference between that is a gain or loss.  Gains are taxable.  Period.  Any disposition is a taxable event.  Trade it for USD - taxable.  Purchase an ice-cream code - taxable.  Exchange it to dogecoin - taxable.  Pay rent with it - taxable. Use it for a downpayment on a house - taxable.  Taxable. Taxable. Taxable. All of it taxable.  Failure to report it or misreporting it - a federal crime.  
The good thing is - you can use loses to offset gains - A LOT of people are going to have losses going forward.

That. . .is a fantasy.  it will never been a global reserve currency.  It may achieve some utility for the black market - in fact, I think this is bitcoin's killer app so to speak - something that central governments will work very very very very extremely very very very very hard to limit.  
Someday there may well be digital currencies in the future - but they'll be run through central banks - it won't be bitcoin.
The best characterization of bitcoin is that it is a digital commodity.  It doesn't produce income, you can't rent it, or store stuff in it, or consume it, or make anything with it.  As a currency, it is remarkably not useful and severely hampered by the reality that all exchanges are potentially taxable events. 
It's primary function is to be traded.  It's not a stock, it doesn't give you a right of ownership in an asset.  It's not a bond with a right of payment.  
It's a virtual digital commodity - and the reason it has value is because someone else will pay you for it.  A lot less than they were willing three months ago.

I'm no Japanese attorney, but in the US, this concept is known as Quantum Meruit - and it's an action in contract law. 
I'm not sure how it would apply in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding in which all contracts are voidable by the trustee.  
In US, a court in equity could find under the doctrine of unclean hands that a defendant cannot enrich himself through various bad acts that have caused the loss to others, even if within technical rights under the law.  would have to find that there was "bad faith" - but I would expect that there is ample evidence of that here.  
The plaintiffs possibly could sue (under US law) for specific performance - they could ask for the bitcoin back instead of the value in yen of the bitcoin at the time of the bankruptcy petition.  No one would be made whole, but the shareholders wouldn't make out like bandits.  
This is so blatantly unjust.  I hope Japanese courts are able to figure out a better outcome.

Sophisticated (and not necessarily very) criminals will easily be able to use bitcoin to move potentially huge sums of wealth instantaneously to other well disguised entities and launder money with an ease that organized crime entities could only have dreamed of - this is absolutely a threat to world order - so much so that I expect the major economies of the world will be putting severe restrictions on how it can be access and exchanged.  
Not sure what you mean by the fed won't audit itself - it conducts audits on itself all the time - that's how controls work.  
The philosophy behind it is a mishmash of anarcho-capitalism and Ayn Rand libertarianism with some black helicopter tin hattism thrown in for good measure.  It isn't intellectually serious.  
I've watched enough of Antonoplous to know it's pretty bright and very wrong about some things about the role and importance that central banks play in large economies.

"Is the system inherently flawed like he (AA) argues?"
I don't know how you can argue something that's been in place for hundreds of years is "inherently flawed" except to say all systems designed by man are inherently flawed.  There is no perfect governance, there is no perfect organization, there is no perfect system.  The real question is - does it fulfill it's purpose and the answer to that in undoubtedly, yes, with the understanding that systems can always be made better.   
"If yes, do you share his reasoning?"  No, obviously, I think its ludicrous to suggest that systems that have been in place can for hundreds of years and that interact in innumerable ways in the economy and with quite literally billions of people can be simply replaced with an idea that is a few years old and wholly untested in any kind of real scale.  
Even if what he wants were desirable, and I'm far from reaching that conclusion, it would take a quantum leap in complexity to even work.  This is what AA just blithely skips over.

3.  Because bitcoin can be used for lots of nefarious purposes I expect governments all over the world will begin to recognize the threat and attack it (states are slow to regulate, but come with a kick when they do).

You guys have convinced yourself that bitcoin is good, and therefore, it has no deleterious consequences.  But you're not thinking clearly. 
Bitcoin isn't being disproportionately ridiculed for demand of electricity - the demand is massive.  That there are other large demands doesn't excuse bitcoin.  I spend a lot of time critiquing carbon emissions due to auto-mobiles and the way we build cities.  And if some asshole on the internet said "whatabout" bitcoin I'd have the same response - that has nothing to do with this problem, you're just making an excuse to defend your interest.
The real problem is - bitcoin serves no purpose.  Money already exists.  Bitcoin isn't actually used for anything other than trading (and supports of illicit behavior).  Trade can be handled by any number of asset classes - we don't need a huge energy suck for that.  Supporting illicit trade and tax cheats is an absolute negative.  So yeah, it's a waste of energy, and a huge one, that the world doesn't need at a critical time in geologic history.

That's a tautology.  
"And "stable" investments are only "stable" becuase they have already satutated the market and minimized volatility?"  No - things that have markets and supply chains, or spin off predictable revenue streams, or are indexed to something are stable.  Bitcoin has nothing to ground it. 100% speculation.

Bitcoin will never be stable - that's a fantasy.  Decentralization ensures that will be the case.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:43:30
Why would I predict whether there will be 200 centralized currencies?  
Countries that are corrupt, and insolvent, and have horrific monetary policy will continue to heap misery on their people.  
And bitcoin lost 85% of its value this year.  Bitcoin doesn't fix any thing.  It's just a nothing fucking wild ride of an asset class.  And yes, if I were in an area of great instability I would move cash on hand to something more stable, like dollars, and hold wealth into something else that generates money.

"Good point. Better avoid trading cash, cryptocurrencies, foreign currencies."
"I guess you just like keeping ammo and canned food in your basement."
Not at all, that's the alt-white anarcho-capitalist wing of the bitcoiners you're thinking of.
BTW, I usually don't judge people by the company they keep, but bitcoiners have some pretty shady fellow-travelers.

Pretty simple, he's a bullshit artist and I don't like bullshit artists.  
Snakeoil salesmen are bad news, always have been, always will be. 
But this brand is both particularly noxious and I think dangerous.  I think the world is extremely fragile right now and we need less bullshit in it.  AA is not going to bring the system down himself obviously  - but he's not helping either.

Thing is, if you ask me "is the banking system perfect" the answer would be good lord no.  If you asked me should we be doing things to fix it, the answer would be "100%, absolutely". No bank should ever be "too big to fail" and any bank that even approaches that size should be subject to anti-trust.  And banks need more stringent stress tests.  And banks need more controls on trades - for example, no legitimate bank should ever have a trading desk in anything as shady as bitcoin.  There's a whole host of regulations that could be tweaked - including a lot of consumer protection controls that could be better.
Notice something here - all of these fixes involve what?  A better regulatory scheme than we have.
What does AA propose?  Burning the entire fucking system to the ground, chucking out the regulatory scheme altogether, and relying on absurdist libertarian principles that somehow work out alright in the end because we'll have a benevolent capitalism (somehow).  Nothing in human history suggests that's remotely possible.  It's all a bunch of nonsense.

*global warming is a fraud, ice sheets are depending on Chicago any day*
*takes breath*
*even if it isn't a fraud, there's no way to stop it*
Dude, there's this thing you might have heard of - science.  And practitioners are called scientists.  And the scientists, that is, the people with the training and knowledge, are in incredibly broad agreement on this point - the world is warming, rapidly, and the source of that warming is anthropogenic.  
The consequences of this are going to be dire.  
But here's the kicker.  We are not helpless.  The commons can be managed.  It's called governance - and it happens in big ways and small all the fucking time.
So stop putting your head in the fucking sand.  Understand that this is a real problem.  Get busy advocating for your government to work with others to fucking avoid the worst impacts of an impending disaster.  
Or go play with your nerd bucks and feel good about doing your part to creating misery for future generations.

Mostly that it serves no useful purpose.  But what gets my ire up isn't bitcoin, it's all the fucking hucksters and promoters that string together a series of beliefs (charitably) to create an image of both what it is, and what the world is, that is badly divorced from reality.  Real people get taken in by it and real people are going to be hurt very badly.  
That's most of it.

uh, for one, gold is not stable. . .
It's not the wild fucking ride like bitcoin - but bitcoin is in a class of its own since it is 100% market psychology.
Gold has industrial uses, and used used in fashion, art, jewelry, etc.
Currency well controlled by monetary policy in well run countries is, by comparison, way more stable.

Banking has a lot of problems.  And it definitely needs reforms.  But just because the part is true doesn't make a whole bunch of other shit he says is true.  That's what the AAcolytes are missing.  
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:55:42
1.  There are oodles and oodles of better way to store value.  In fact, bitcoin is one of the worst if you want stability and predictable growth (neither of which are or will ever be, a salient property of bitcoin)
2.  You obviously are unaware of the powers of the state.  Now, of course, criminals can and do use bitcoin to make it hard on law enforcement.  But seizure of bitcoin can and is done with crimes reach a level of interest to invest the resources.  It does shield a lot of low level criminality though - and that is a bug, not a feature. 
3.  You are just justifying protections for criminals.  There's a shitton of good reasons to have heavy controls on the use of money.  You're pitching a libertarian fantasy that would devolve into a hobbsian world of strong men.  Dark times indeed. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:29:14

Science that pays for results isn't science, its propaganda.  Propaganda is bad enough when it's just propaganda.  But when it's a masquerade backed by billionaires it moves policy.

In my lifetime gold has been as low as $35/ounce and has high as $1700/ounce (more than 800% the rate of inflation over that time period). It gained 400% then lost 30% of that in less than a decade. 
Within that it had many spikes and many dips - it is volatile by most reasonable measures. 
That might be rock solid in the bitcoin world, but not by most standards.

"deflationary" is exactly the property that dooms bitcoin.  It makes it useless as a fucking currency.  Deflationary = hoarding.  Hoarding means no circulation and highly inequitable distribution, and highly volatile pricing (not coincidently the the properties that bitcoin is known best for).
"unconfiscatable"  1.  That's not true. Bitcoin is confiscatable when criminal use of it rises to attention and concern of law enforcement.  2.  unconfiscatable is definitely not unhackable, unstealable, un-loseable as we've seen time and again.  3. You say it like it's a good thing - the ability to confiscate money is one of the tools the prevents a lot of horrific things - human trafficking, child pornography, arms trade, drug trade, tax cheating and evasion.

That's a weird read that crypto is a continuation of democratization.  
But even, for the sake of argument you're right, a world without controls is a hobbsian one - a world of strongmen, and winner take all - it is brutal, not a liberal Paradise.  Tyranny is bad but so is anarchy.

I'm not going to reply to your wall of text except to say the statement:  
but it will be better or it will go extinct.
Is correct - it will go extinct (well not exactly extinct, irrelevant, like. . .linden dollars or something).    And the reason it will go extinct is that it doesn't nothing that actually money doesn't already do, but better.  The only real advancement of bitcoin is anonymity - and that is dangerous (which is why it will be regulated). 
FTR, I think a centralized digital currency is likely.  And it will not be bitcoin.   It will be:
1. centralized
2. inflationary
3. stable
4. non-anonymous
5. quick
6. scalable
None of those things that bitcoin can offer - it will be rendered a novelty in the long-term.  That's my prediction - take it to a bank.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:41:24
The theory presented is that this massive hedge funds and banks have depressed bitcoin in order to purchase it.  
OK - so why is the price half or less than when they purchased it.  If they're manipulating the market by purchasing they're not doing a bang up job.

Some facts are spot on - and then he draws huge inferences from them and makes large leaps of logic.  
It's a neat trick, he puts just enough legitimate material to work on the uninformed. In fact, it's the same exact BS practiced by other BS artists throughout time - they cherry pick facts for legitimacy, draw unwarranted inferences from them, make conclusionary statements without having to prove anything.  AA does it all the time.
Once you're tuned to it, you'll see the pattern again, and again, and again.

Like all conspiracists, he cherry picks facts (for respectability), arranges them in a seeming logical way, draws inferences for listeners that connect the cherry picked facts in just the right way to create an image that seems informed to the uninformed, but is really just a picture that he's drawn for you.

Not going to get into it  here - no time.  He's obviously well informed and knowledgeable about technical aspects of bitcoin, how it works, why it works, potential uses, etc.  He uses this to give himself the air and image of an authority - he is an authority on bitcoin itself.
He's somewhat knowledgeable about banking - but much less so than bitcoin.  He does have a few facts on hand that he uses in most lectures, and you can't disagree with those.  But they're cherry picked - with large gaps between them, and then he draws the rather exotic inferences to paint a picture for an audience that considers him an authority on the subject.  And when you point out that the inference or the leap of logic he asks the audience to accept is just that - everyone goes, well "NO WAY - DO YOU DISAGREE WITH POINTS A, B, and C THAT HE SAID?"  And the answer is of course, not, but he's using those as a sleight of hand to force a conclusion that is totally unwarranted.  It's the same thing you see with lots of conspiracists - like Corsi, Stone, Jones and others.  Unfortunately it works on way too many people.  
Once you see this pattern with him, you can't unsee it - he does it over, and over, and over.  Watch a few videos - you'll pick up on it.
