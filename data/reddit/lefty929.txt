Is there an official statement from them saying that they hold full reserve? If so, why isn't it posted front-row-center on Tether's website?
Why does Tether's website contain childish passive-aggressive quotes like "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you."
What kind of reputable, professional company writes stupid shit like that on their website while addressing claims targeting their credibility?
Smells weird to me.

Stop talking about btc futures. The volume is too small to impact the price.
When are people gonna *actually read*?

It's not an opinion. With volume this small futures have no impact.
If anything this is a testament to how idiots can spread lies like wildfire.

Banks are the most heavily regulated industries in the world. They need to hold on to something like 10% of their cash on reserve by law. As well as being subject to the most insane regulatory scrutiny, stress tests and other exercises every year.
Tether, being in the much riskier crypto space, should theoretically have a MUCH higher reserve requirement.  For the time being I personally think tether should have something like an 80% reserve requirement.
But they *don't have any reserve requirement at all*. We don't even know IF they hold reserves. Furthermore we don't even know if they actually received payment for giving out Tethers.
So here's a company that supposedly has received $2 BILLION in cash and given out as many tethers. Yet they haven't provided ANY AUDIT INFO from a single reputable auditing firm, despite their site saying they undergo audits all the time. 
Tether underlies the whole crypto market and this shit is pretty worrisome to me. I don't usually fall for bullshit FUD, I'm still HODLing but this more than any other reason makes me seriously consider cashing out and waiting to see if either 1) Tether fails or 2) They truly are just backlogged.
Tether could be doing a lot more to reassure us than putting up a response page saying "trust us".
Nonetheless, this is pretty worrisome that this audit relationship has dissolved.

Mate just to be clear, empirical evidence has shown elliot wave to be no different from a random walk i.e. throwing darts at a dartboard gives you the same success rate as this technique

It's an irrational market mate. Its moves are totally random.
Despite what you read on the internet, no one has any fucking clue where prices will go
