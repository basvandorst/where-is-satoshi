Just don't forget you will still need a credit card at the hotel!

Oh yeah that would be it. I assume people respect hotels in Asia.
People break our flat screen TVs at least once a month. It is also illegal to smoke in hotels where I live so we can charge them 250$ for that.

Really how many hotels do you stay in? Expedia does not pass on cc info so unless those hotels trust you not to damage a single thing they are pretty stupid. It also says on every Expedia reservation you must brig a credit card with you or prepare to pay a deposit.
I know you instantly put on my shit list if your refuse to provide a card.

How could it be banned??

Look websites do not dictate the rules of the hotel. 
If you want to check in I need a credit or debit card. 
I'm not trusting shit in my hotel and then have to pay out of pocket when my boss comes bitching.
Almost as bad as people who refuse to show ID....

It makes tax evading a level playing field. The US may step it up when it comes to tax loopholes if the layman can dodge taxes.

Not at every hotel you mean. 
Why a hotel would rent w/o a deposit is ludicrous though.

Pointing out a untrustworthy trading source? What an ass.
