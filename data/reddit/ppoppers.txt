Why would someone lie about this?

You should make one of your nice videos on the production process!

I hate this guy so, so much. I love dark wallet and the idea of some of his other projects, but shit. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 12:59:12
Yes this would be too good. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 03:05:35
I'm sure this is *discrimination* or something, but anytime I see someone vaping on camera, I automatically loose all respect for them. Just like, stop, don't do it. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 01:41:51
I keep seeing chicken references, can you explain? 
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:32:18
This is so cute. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:44:30
Yea, I don't know how it does it, but it's amazing. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:45:51
Eh, Steve Gibson vetted lastpass, I trust them just from that. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 02:16:13
Aaww that's cute. I obviously didn't watch every minute of the video :/

I don't think that's the issue. From his wording, he believes that if we (unknowingly) receive bitcoin that was, at some point, involved with money laundering, that we could be held responsible for that. I know this isn't true, but need something more official. I'm going to reach out to BitPay and see what they can send, as well. 
I should say that if we end up accepting Bitcoin, the board is defiantly going to want to cash out instantly, so holding and riding the market isn't a concern. I would love to hold, but that's most certainly not going to happen, so I'm not even offering it as an option. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:12:48
I don't know why I didn't think of them first! 
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:57:11
I run Lucie's Place, a non profit in Central Arkansas who is working to open a home for homeless LGBT young adults. It wouldn't be a *glamorous* thing to raise money for, but we need around $25k to open our home. This amount would be well within a realistic amount for the bitcoin community to raise.

More info?

I don't remember who it was, but some guest came on tnt recently and said Snowden should be quartered and shot. IMO I don't really think that's a) a valid opinion and b) an opinion that the host should have let slide through. It just felt icky. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:13:55
Yea, the problem is that he has raised these concerns, the rest of the board has heard them, so now they want to have a conversation and vote on it. Sigh. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:12:34
Wait, are you in the wrong subreddit? 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:02:11
mycellium takes care of the issues surrounding change with a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 20:02:41
More like buttcoin
@_date: 2014-10-09 02:36:26
I'm so, so frustrated by the whole thing (and I'm currently [getting this]( which helps nothing). 
During the outage I sent several emails to hi asking for emergency withdrawals, they were all ignored. Once the site was back up, I tried to log in and it didn't recognize my account. I got sent a reactivation link, but it didn't reactivate my mintpal account, but ended up creating an account in the moolah support forum. Sent several emails trying to get it figure out, have heard nothing. 
I would love to be part of a settlement, but I didn't have a lot in there, so I don't know if it would be worth it. I think a couple thousand Hirocoin, .1 Bitcoin and several thousand Jackpotcoin. Thoughts?

[This is already a thing!]( 
@_date: 2014-07-11 01:13:45
Oh, where is this from? Someone on grindr (lol) had this as his profile picture and i figured it wasn't original. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:13:13
She is actually the one who emailed me back when I sent them a message!
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:30:48
I've never had gold before :/
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:49:00
They have come close, at least. My mortgage is 3.75
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:35:43
We would instantly cash out through bit pay, so market fluctuations don't affect the cash we see. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:37:54
I havn't been listening, I don't do triangulation, but I may need to start! Now that Tom &amp; Brian are gone from twit, I've been loving the network less :/
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:02:24
I don't even know how I would react to this news if it was me. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:34:49
I missed out :(
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:13:22
Link? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:29:22
Oh I miss high-school. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:29:29
I hate this guy so much 
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:50:09
Wait is this a real bot!? 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:11:21
Oh, I'd be interested in seeing the entire thing! Book binding is interesting to me, though I know nothing about it and have no idea what the process looks like. A little 1-2 minute video would be neat
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:31:13
As a non profit using bit pay, we would receive donations with no fees attached (unlike the 2.2% + $.03 we currently get through paypal). Done. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 01:03:46
Came home from a rough backpacking trip and found this. Good!
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:22:28
Yes yes yes
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:57:02
Okay, I will open yet another ticket. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:44:17
The organization has only been around since 2011, so it's still relatively small. But, we're on track to open our doors by the end of this year, which is super exciting. It all depends on how quick we can get this final stretch of cash. We've got a few grant requests out and I feel really good about those. We've actually been getting some good press lately, including an Al Jazeera America article!

Awkward :/

That address is copied and pasted from the OP post. Only receiving 2 tips for this service is absurd. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 03:25:41
For all this, I was expecting far more than one miner.

I had no idea we got new $100s
Edit: it looks like we didn't I don't understand. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:22:46
Aw I can't wait for that to happen! 
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:34:20

Oh hello! 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:08:49
I started [Lucie's Place]( and I/we work with homeless LGBT young adults in the Central Arkansas area. It's been a labor of love, but certainly took quite a bit of money up front from my own pocket, which I never expect to see back. But, .1BTC would certainly help a bit! So, this isn't really a 'this is what I would do', but more of a 'this is what I'm doing and will continue to do'
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:57:33
This is my first time working with the bittip bot, but I *hope* I successfully forwarded that to the LP bitpay address (1BbxRCKdPPvUCmoLW7wAxQAephtBgcQ5iq). I'll check and make sure it went through

Most impressive of all, you only have 1 unread email in your gmail. Inbox zero is a dream of mine, but I currently have 8,000 unread :/
