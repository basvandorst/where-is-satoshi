I'm going to give you a long-ass answer, because there are certain things you really DO need to understand!! First of I'm going to tell you what you're going to do RIGHT NOW! Then I'll give you an explanation that I hope you'll read because you certainly need some help (and no, I don't mean that in an offensive way like most of the others seems to do...)
Firstly; you will sell all your Bitcoins right NOW! Get that money of that market! (If you are so certain of being able to earn this money back, then there's no need for you to do that today! Money out, earn the rest back later.)
Secondly; according to you, you'll then have about 280k $ which you will put in two different savings account in a **trusted** bank. One account will hold 200k $, and the other will hold about 80k $.
Thirdly; tell your sister EVERYTHING!
Fourthly (lol, that a word;p); if you don't have one already, get A JOB!
Fifthly; don't think I've got another point :P ...yet.
Allright, so to the explanations... First, who am I to give you advice? (I'm not too familiar with all the different english terms for "money transactions" etc., so sorry if somethings unclear.) About eight years ago I wanted to figure out what all of this stock-market-easy-money-thing was all about, so therefore I invested about all my "savings" into the stock-market. I was about 20 years old and had about 3-4000 $. Not much, but it was what I had, and it was just an experiment on my part really. I just wanted to learn, and I saw that money as already lost! As about two years went by, I had tried a lot of different things, day-trading, long-term trading, low-risk and high-risk trading etc. etc. I felt I learned a lot, and I wanted to invest more, but this time with a goal to earn some money out of it. So I put in an additional 10k $ and had about 15k $ as the first money actually had grown a bit in the end. Today that money is about 75k $. Nothing great, but it's been just a hobby, as my main focus has been studying and now working. I'm just trying to say that I have some experience with this, and I've experienced all the good and bad parts (I've been down to about 1000 $ and up to 100k $, so it's been a fun journey.), and likewise as you, I've been selling low and buying high over a long period of time...and I feel with you!
Why sell all your bit coins right now? Because you need to learn how the market works before you invest in it! Blindly investing in some stock/company/resource/currencies/input-whatever-you-like-here, is just gambling! Then you might as well go to Vegas and have a crazy good time at least! So get your money out! I'm not very familiar with bit coins, but from what I hear (and seen now with a quick glance at the graph of it), it's crazy volatile and soooooo risky! Obviously you want some quick money, but T H A T W I L L N O T H A P P E N. "Easy come, easy go" is a saying for a reason!
Put your money in a safe place! And why split them into 200k and 80k? Because those 200k is your sisters money and you will NEVER touch them again! "...a verbal contract between my father and I..."; a verbal contract is just as binding as a written one!! If your father wanted your sister to have that money, IT IS HER MONEY!! And why do you think your father gave you all the money for (let me help you..) safekeeping!? 
Why haven't you told all of this to your sister?? She might hate you for it, yes, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't deserve to know!! And you certainly deserve at least some of the hatred! SHE NEEDS TO KNOW! What you should say and do, is that you give her those 200k when she is 21, and you'll owe her about 140k (175k - 30k - 5k - more??) which you will (here comes my last point..);
...get a decent job for and W O R K  Y O U R  A S S  O F F  T O  G E T  A N D  G I V E  T O  H E R!!!!! END OF STORY!
Some general investment advices:
With those 80k you got left, you can do with as you please. If you really want to learn to invest, you need to learn how it works first. And bit coins is a bad place to start! There's a lot of reasons for that, but firstly because it's so volatile. Secondly, because you should invest in something that's more hands-on. "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet..." WTF is that?! It cannot get any more unsafe than that! If anyone ever should invest in this, losing all the invested money should not affect them any, meaning you should see the money as already lost! So, will you put your livelihood into that? Will you want to say that your livelihood is already lost??
"I know I can earn this money back, I just need to figure out how."
There's no solution to markets! You cannot know that you can earn the money back! There's nothing to figure out!! Especially with bit coins!!! 
"Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin." How is this in any way, shape or form safe? Aaahhh..I can go on about this, but I'll leave it be.. All I can say is, and people with some knowledge about these things should agree with me!, bit coins are a bad place to start investing a lot of money. 
Another thing, how have you not learned anything about your investments so far? You have lost roughly 400k on this investment, and you still want to invest all your and your sisters money back into it?? There's nothing stopping you from loosing another 300k!! Do you not understand this?!
"How can I guarantee that I earn high returns?" Argh!! C'mon man! In markets, there is no such thing as guarantees!!! If anybody tell you that they can guarantee anything in these matters, YOU SHOULD **ABSOLUTELY NOT** TRUST THEM!!!
When it comes to money, nobody can be trusted... You have lied to your sister... do you see?! Even your sister can't trust you! So the question remains if you can trust yourself? ...it seems not... :/
