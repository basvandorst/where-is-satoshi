I've used bittrex a few times and have even used their support system twice.  Never had a problem, they even helped remove my 2fa requirement when I stupidly factory reset the device that I was using without saving the passcode to setup 2fa. Every time I had to use their support system I've had my issue resolved within 72hrs. 
Maybe I'm just lucky, maybe others made mistakes, maybe some are lying to spread fud.

I do wish you the best of luck, hopefully your situation gets resolved. I've just seen so many posts about this type of problem that I wonder how many are honest, how many are user error, or am I just VERY lucky in my experience with bittrex.

You make a couple of fair points that I would like to try to respond to starting with the intro to your post. 
I agree that many Bitcoin "participants" right now use Bitcoin as a  store of value, I think that there a few reasons for this. First and likely largest would be the influx of investors that Bitcoins astronomical rise in value has brought, many people who have bought Bitcoin see its potential to make them very wealthy without actually understanding or caring about Satoshi's original view/plan/desire for Bitcoin. The second reason I see many 'Bitcoiners' not currently using Bitcoin as a currency is because the technology just isn't ready for that yet. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, I would dare to say that we are still in the beta stage. This is also my answer to your second point.  Bitcoin is much slower and more expensive to use as a currency right now, and there are no guarantees that will ever change.  Many of us hope that one day it will change and Bitcoin can and will be used as a currency, but maybe Bitcoin will go the way of gold and only be used as a store of value and one of the altcoins that are faster and cheaper will be the actual currency. 
Now on to your final point and the one that persuaded me to put the effort into typing a long post on a mobile device(it sucks). Regardless of who wrote the original Bitcoin whitepaper, naming rights and branding are important and powerful. The reason people are pissed about the name Bitcoin Cash(insert Dark, Gold, Unlimited, Platinum, Diamond, etc) are twofold. Imagine Wal-Mart naming their generic cola Sam's Pepsi, or Coke Walmart. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have built brand value with their customer base and wouldn't be happy to have their customers confused with some other product that they have no quality control over, among many other concerns. The second reason I see is that many Bitcoin users don't want new investors to get confused between products and possibly not get what they thought they were buying. Bitcoin forks are fine, actually good in most cases.  Look at Litecoin, the creators had a vision of what they thought Bitcoin should do better. Obviously the Bitcoin community disagreed so there was a hard fork and a new coin was created. The reason that Litecoin doesn't receive thesame vitriol and hate that Bcash, Bgold, etc do is that Litecoin chose not to try to use parasitic marketing(using the Bitcoin brand and name as is they are the same thing or part of a product family), as well as the fact that Roger Ver has made it VERY easy and somewhat fun to hate him and anything he touches.

This is what I want to put more attention to

P2P cellular is great in highly urbanized areas, where many people have cell phones. But it cannot work across large empty areas (like oceans) for global communications. 
The best known p2p cellular texting app, at least known to the western world, came from the uprisings in Egypt.  But that technology cannot at this point transverse large expanses of empty area (land or sea).

This is a shitpost, OP is obviously trying to convince people that something is broken.  There is no other reason to try to show that OP has to transfer BTW and pay artificially inflated fees (we all know why and who is behind them by now). It's either more fud from the btrash camp or a BTC user that doesn't know enough to be an early adopter.  Don't fall for the fud, just hold.

Well, this new technology couldn't depend on or piggyback on existing telecom or cellular systems since large companies own the infrastructure that our communication travels on. And those companies mainly try to protect or expand profits, as well are subject to central government rules, they are the main weak link in a truly fair community trading system.

So fucking happy to see this dip... Buy, buy, and buy some more

I hope it was Roger Ver

My concern is the telecom  companies that currently control internet communication. IMHO that is the weak link for a true revolution. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:58:38
 But that doesn't address the issue of trying to pass communications over oceans. This is the hurdle we must pass.
