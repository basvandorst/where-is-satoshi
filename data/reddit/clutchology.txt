...in the mainstream media. Paul Krugman's just a guy with a blog, using your logic.

Bitcoin is more efficient than massive banks with massive infrastructures which will be put out of business if it goes mainstream. Kthxbye

The only thing that matters is the argument itself. Not reputation which was earned posting pictures of cats. Argument, evidence, or nothing.

The drug users are sick! And this guy knows what's best for the homeless. Give him all of the guns and he'll make the world a better place. 
Fool. No thanks. If I want to be a homeless drug user, please, casually fuck off. I don't even know you, yet you think you know what's best for me? Or a billion others?

Sorry, champ. Adam Kokesh is not the face of Freedom, nor should he be. If we get a shot at an actual dialog with a mainstream candidate, you're saying we as a movement would produce Adam Kokesh to make our case? 
No. Stefan Molyneux is light years ahead of anyone in a head to head exchange. Kokesh doesn't speak fluidly or convincingly at all, although I do respect some of the what he's done.

And why does the U.S. Government need the federal reserve to issue currency at all? Nonsense about a lack of politicization? And why are we paying federal reserve dividends to a cabal of bankers every year again? 
Because this bullshit passed on Christmas Eve in secret and transformed us all into permanent debt slaves? 
Here's a question: if every dollar magicked into existence comes with interest, doesn't the supply of currency always have to expand in order to pay that interest? Gee golly the fed saved us from variable currency rates!

You stress test in production? Fool.

Great guys. A liberal is here to make things better for us. He's going to prevent monetary inflation! Liberals are so good at that, you know. Just give them the power...they're just going to make things better, don't worry.

Victimless crimes aren't crimes. His criminal enterprise likely decreased violent crimes inherent to black markets precipitously. You should thank him.
