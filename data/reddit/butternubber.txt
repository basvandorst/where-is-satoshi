Double spend the inputs to a safe address with a healthy fee, and never send without healthy fees ever again.

If LocalBitcoins puts a turd on their plate and you get E Coli from the pasta also on the plate, the plate was compromised.

The problem with mobile wallets is that even the best mobile wallet software has to run on an incredibly hostile environment. If you have to do this though a wifi only device might offer a small margin of safety over a device with cellular connectivity as the latter includes an entirely separate operating system with the ability to bugger  anything running over it as a necessary condition of accessing the cellular network.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:25:10
Well then what the fuck else are they doing with them. Maybe they aren't waiting for them all to withdraw at once, but... I'd hope they at least have the coins that they are supposed to have.

Seeing as Andreas is about as far as one can come from actual Bitcoin aristocracy I can't count that for much. As loathsome as many find him Mircea Popescu vs. Yanis would be a much better debate. Mircea at least controls enough Bitcoins on his own to be firmly planted in a Bitcoin aristocracy.

This seems incredibly dangerous mostly because some elliptic curves are easier to break. Now, what would be a helpful alternative is more address spaces for differenct kinds of transaction signing algorithms. For example RSA at large key length is going to take more bytes for a transaction, but for large numbers of coins the extra security will be well worth the transaction fee.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:52:31
For maximum paranoia protection, print the signed transaction in a good OCR font and then scan it onto the online system. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:41:18
Not very "mobile" then.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:13:26
Well there's an actual problem here. Many people acknowledge that Bitcoin is money in the realest sense, but on the other hand at the moment many of the people who see that are scammers.
The solution is legitimate adoption. The remitance market is probably prime for this.

Of course the keys and signatures would need to be much bigger, but with that comes greater certainty and safety. Think cold storage. and security for Billion+ dollar addresses.
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:28:46
Get your keys, import them into a better (non-web) wallet and respend from there.

But they still served the shit. Don't blame the mice when you find them in your kitchen. Place the person who invited the mice by spreading crumbs. If you have a platform and incorporate a third party element into it you are responsible for whatever harm that element brings.
In Bitcoin this responsibility is based not in law, but fact. LocalBitcoins chose to fart on their plates and some of their weaker customers who trusted them are now ill. It doesn't matter where what was served was contaminated, but that LocalBitcoins served poison. Yes the consumers ought to have known better, but in the future knowing better means escewing a venue that sells turds as sausages on the virtue of both being cylinders.

Old Thinkpads (All the way back to the IBM branding) are going to be golden for this application. The thing is if you want offline storage, keep it offline and find otherways to pass things to sign and signed data to and from the internet. Optical (QRcodes etc) would work. Printed and scanned text could work. Just... When you say offline, commit to offline.
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:15:12
Well one way to protect the fungibility of Bitcoing is "lossy mixing" where a number of coins go to addresses that demonstrably belong to assorted other parties in order to make identifying which party spending coins from the hack might be actually be related to the hack. The Bitstamp hackers can probably keep spreading these coins in further transactions losing some along the way while also spending some coins themselves.
Is it expensive? Very. Compared to what getting these coins likely cost them? The Bitstamp attackers still recieved these coins at a bargain.

I think using the Bitcoin logo as the impression for the wax seal is kinda stupid as it makes the thing an identifiable targe, but a wax seal on a document can be part of a layered approach to detering against physical tampering.

Nope. Some reliable parts of the Bitcoin universe will persist outside the Fiat universe. BitBet seems to be exactly that kind of part.

There is a contender to the Bitcoin Foundation title which is working on an audited release of the code necessary to run Bitcoin as a fully validating node. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:24:42
It's unlikely all of the large No bets were Mircea.  It isn't unthinkable that there are older holders of substantial BTC that would trust the platform enough to take the No side of the bet.
@_date: 2015-02-19 00:43:00
Also note that bitnodes.io only shows version 0.8 and newer nodes. Some people choose not to or simply can't run newer version. None of the LevelDB clients work on my flavor of *nix so it is to the past and hand patching for my node(s).

There is no way to demonstrate that. Even if he did it can't be proven.

If you have a spare box around it can be a lot of fun learning OpenBSD's pf which the FreeBSD pf/pfsense are based off of. Tends to be less bloated and so much more powerful when you get the text to feed it down.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:02:17
A valid concern. Especially considering many of the organizations pushing for multisig are ones that want to be your second and third signatures.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:01:36
No, and this isn't a bad thing. By default you are the sole master of your keys and signatures. Multisig mean you are bringing in a second or third party which needs to be trusted. Making multisig a default instead of a special case would involve breaking the trust model.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:06:07
It might have uses, but it makes no sense as a something to default to. There's maybe a role for multisig in escrow. Maybe a role for certain kinds of back up funds storage. For most people with significant bitcoin though full control of private keys and responsible practices are safe. Attacks on second and third keyholders are a serious risk with multisig.

If you care about your privacy at all you'll need to run your own electrum server which involves having its own copy of the blockchain. You can do this on a VPS though. It's win-win you get a very well connected node and your wallet updates balances fast.

Really the only change is NVIDIA GPUS caught up to how well AMD GPU's mined in 2012 and even then not entirely. And then there's the problem of electricity consumption.
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:38:24
That. The reason people were angry about the Dual EC random number generator the NSA pushed was because it shrank the space private keys derived through it could fall into to a more brute forceable window.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:57:18
No idea, but since the birth of GPU mining in 2010, ATI/AMD has always hashed better at their price point and power consumption. 1 GH/s or higher from a fire risk (sorry, overclocked mining rig) wasn't uncommon back then.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:13:16
Huh, who would have though CCN and NewsBTC would do something so shady again just as they are getting over the GAW taint.

What you need to do is set up your own copy of electrum server. This involves downloading a copy of a large database in a format the Electrum server can read or generating a copy of that database yourself. It isn't hard really, and if you use electrum and care about privacy setting up your own private electrum server is one of the best steps you can take.
