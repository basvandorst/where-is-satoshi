I dunno, most of those people bought in because they thought it would make them money. They aren’t “true believers,” successful investors don’t get sentimental about a brand enough to stay in it if they can make money elsewhere. They are mercenary enough to move their money to wherever they see it worth the most. They are flighty, they chase trends. It doesn’t matter much what the coin is worth, but what they expect it’s growth to look like. Past performance doesn’t indicate future performance. There are other networks growing FAST right now. Cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, easy to move your money out of, I’m not sure that having the most users/money invested is a sticking point. Especially with market cap shuffling like it has these last two weeks.

Man, they ground their own people’s bones with tank treads, burned the remains in the streets with flamethrowers and washed their ashes into to the sewers. Possibly thousands of people. You think our track record is *anywhere near* that? Maybe it’s because of that little piece of paper that allows us to defend ourselves that authoritarian statists like you hate so much. 
China is the regional powerhouse. If we think China when we think Asian politics, that’s why. If you think about who is the powerhouse in the America’s and your mind doesn’t go to USA, you’re tripping. 


You can’t have it both ways, either we are so successful we have more food than we can eat or we are “left behind economically.” When was the last time we had mass starving? No one over here has to eat dirt or pets. Our successful capitalist system literally produces more food than we can eat, let’s hear back from you when imported Chinese products stop making Americans sick. The world economy literally rests on our shoulders.


Idiot. Only the state can truly censor you. Google can’t censor me and never will. A company deciding what ads they run is capitalism. The Chinese government censoring what their own people can say and see totalitarian and abhorrent.

I’m doing real well so far, thanks. Capitalism has done a good job of extending my projected lifespan actually, I’m not too worried. It’s made your treatments possible too - you should be thankful. Previous to research and mass production by -gasp- american capitalist pig pharmaceutical companies and the FDA, synthesized testosterone wasn’t being used medicinally.

You might as well be a holocaust denier then. That’s the quality of person you are. 
Any comment you made after that statement, especially the ones where you seem to think I’m defending anything the American military industrial complex is guilty of, is totally moot. You are the opposite of an intellectual - pretending to be some big brained enlightened leftist - when in reality you are either willfully ignorant towards very well documented events in history you’re denying ever even happened, and the atrocities to come that would literally need to occur for communism to take hold, or you are total garbage and think the sacrifice would be worth it. Which means you’re still an idiot because you would be putting into place a system that has never proven to work and will never work, because all it can do is create totalitarian dictatorships that destroy economies and rely on violence and genocide to remain, until it collapses the society that it feeds off of, like a cancer.

*I’m* grasping at straws? You’re the one who assumes I play video games and can’t get laid, assumes I’m a libertarian or “alt-right” as if that’s the same thing, and assumes my age, gender, race, nationality, everything. You are clinging to all these assumptions because despite all those big books you’ve supposedly read, you suck at debate and are easily exhausted by research. Meanwhile I’ve learned about you, listened to what you’ve said and am confronting you with relevant ideas based off that, instead of clinging to irrelevant tired stereotypes written by boomers unhealthily obsessed with a younger generation. 
And yes, I said “supposedly read”, because if you believe what you say you either haven’t read much or are a conspiracy theorist of some sort. History has been detailed. It’s black and white and at your fingertips. I’m not going to debate that with you because it’s not up for debate. 
So life expectancy is increasing because infants aren’t dying. That’s not entirely true, but that’s about what I can expect from you, so let’s go with it. Infants don’t count then? Of course, you wouldn’t think so. Obviously you don’t value human life anyway, since you’ve shown that you’re ok with families being killed by death squads to make way for your communist utopia. 
Good news: I don’t care to learn about low testosterone. Frankly, what was entertaining about you yesterday is boring me right now, and a bit sad. It’s Monday, I have shit to do other than kick you around. If you’re looking for the last word, feel free.

This is absolutely ridiculous. First of all, you’re bullshitting on an unquantifiable number of “deaths by government” over the last eight decades of a nations history which is completely arbitrary depending on how you want to measure it, referencing a government that I’m not even advocating for. What kind of straw man bullshit is that? Compared to very measurable and deliberate attempts at violent genocide during specific periods of time by the violent authoritarian regimes that pop up *every time* communism is attempted.
Further, you are suggesting that the United States is an alternative to Marxism. Dipshit, one is an ideology and the other is a government. 
And then you suggest that it’s the responsibility of the American government to take on all the mass starvations on the planet by reallocating global resources. How? You think that’s voluntary? You think that’s the US governments responsibility? The only way any government could allocate global resources like that is to conquer the world and do it by force. That’s WW3, followed by a totalitarian one world government. That’s what you’re advocating for because you are a communist bootlicker. 
Let’s estimate that the US government has killed 20 million people in war since WW2. That’s nothing compared to the 100 million deaths you can directly attribute to communist killings. See? I can conflate numbers too. Where exactly are you getting your figures from anyway? Oh wait you aren’t naming numbers or sources you’re just spouting bullshit. 
Let’s just admit you don’t want to have to work for your free shit and are willing to put blinders on to all the atrocities that communism is responsible for, and are willing to ignore any positive effects of everything that’s made modern life possible. American democracy isn’t perfect by any stretch, but not everyone who realizes that communism is a death trap is pro-war, pro-state, or pro-crony capitalism. I’m just sick of acting like any of these communist regimes are effectively any less morally repugnant than nazi Germany because people want free shit and are ok with willful ignorance towards economics and the history of genocides.

If you’re looking to beat this talking point by turning the argument around you’re barking up the wrong tree. Instead of trees being cut down for dollars, look towards the energy consumed by a banking industry as a whole. If banking were made obsolete, servers could be shut down, offices and buildings could be closed and used for something else, no need for executive retreats in private corporate jets, the number of lithium batteries for electronic devices that wouldn’t need produced and trashed within 5 years alone...there are probably better examples. If blockchain did what so many people on this sub want - replace banks, the impact on the environment could be amazing. Meanwhile, people would be researching renewable and super efficient energy because mining would be profitable, and it would help your bottom line to do it efficiently. 
This way you make people defend the banking industry and it’s necessity in the face of blockchain, not scapegoat blockchain for environmental issues it isn’t responsible for.
