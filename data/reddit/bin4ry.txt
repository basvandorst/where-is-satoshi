Sorry, I should have been a bit more clear. I had some issues with them and had to contact support, they spelled my name wrong when I finally verified my account, despite my government ID clearly showing my name. I've also spotted many bugs such as being able to view support tickets while not logged in (although it's empty and shows NaN, still should be behind username/pass), credit card verification forms not showing up despite being in the process of verifying my credit card. Also, their MasterCard is issued by a bank in Belize and when I tried to verify my credit card, the charge came from Romania and I got a phone call from my bank putting the amount charged on hold.
When I asked them if they were planning to do a redesign they didn't even acknowledge my question.
I guess I should have said they are not professional and the service is hard to use (in my experience) instead of them waiting to be hacked.

I've learned to realize that most comments on YouTube/any big blog referring to Bitcoin is absolutely fucking retarded.

Paxum allows instant loading via Credit Card, then you make a transfer from your Paxum account to MtGox/TradeHill. The problem is that Paxum is complete garbage and it seems like their website is waiting to be hacked.
It's very difficult because of charge-backs on credit cards, such as a person can buy bitcoins with a credit card then make a charge-back so they get their money back and have bitcoins as well. Don't forget there's also credit card fees as well, I think it's 2.9%. Unless you're buying super small amounts of bitcoins it's not really worth it, but I do agree, buying with credit card would be awesome.

I'm not too familiar with Bitcoins, but couldn't you just make a bunch of new accounts and send the money between them so it can't be traced?
