What caused these concerns to subside? Was there a fix involved?

Thanks for this! It was concise and thorough :)

Even though bitcoin isn't meant to be anonymous, this kind of experimentation is a bit disturbing and should be looked at.  Can we push this post higher and get more eyes on this?

I just got started with bitcoin for the first time today, and the first post I read is about people giving them away! I figure I might as well post and hope for the best? lol.
Do I have to create another wallet to accept tips, or how does this work?
Edit: Ah. Did some more reading and signed up with changetip.  I never knew it was so easy! I should have gotten started a looong time ago.

I got started with bitcoin yesterday and received some tips in another giveaway thread.  These seems really popular. Are these intended to spur interest in bitcoin in general?  It just amazes me that people enjoy giving money away for free, even though they are only pennies. lol
Edit: Oh ya, and I sent my first tip ever!

Thanks dude! This whole deal is really making me stoked about bitcoin.

Fake as in: they aren't interested in producing real, useful interactions with the system.  Their purpose is to produce faulty or misleading information that is not useful to users. In Bitcoin, this can be thought of as moving dust. Not exactly the same thing, but similar in that dust isn't very useful, yet costs the system resources to move.

I'll look into Stellar, thanks.

Thanks. This is definitely a term that will help my search.
Edit: Reading some of the SybilGuard paper brought me to [Byzantine Fault Tolerance and the Byzantine General Problem]( Pretty interesting!
