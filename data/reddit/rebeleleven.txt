If by that you mean I have an understanding, than I concur. 
If you want to want to educate your self on ante bellum US banking systems and their problems, you should read *A New Economic View of American History* by Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell - two famous economic historians. 
The book covers a great deal of topics. One of the more interesting economics books I've read.

0 inflation is impossible to hit/maintain. An extremely tiny amount of deflation might be *okay*. However, it's generally accepted that a bit of inflation is better than too much deflation.

Deflation is good for the individual's wealth, bad for the economy. Being bad for the economy, I mean it restricts and suffocates investment. Investment being one of the main drivers of job creation. Job creation needed if you want people to be employed. 
I would look into getting a refund for your degree.

You are correct. OP and the general posters in this sub fail to grasp this somewhat basic economic concept. Fiat is not for holding value long term. A small yet stable rate of inflation is good for the economy overall. This is generally taught as fact in basic to intermediate macroeconomics, so I am skeptical of OP's supposed credentials.

I would implore you to read some economic history before making that statement. It's an opinion born out of arrogance of why these banks did so shitty to begin with. 
It worries me that it's the most upvoted comment.

Allow me to rephrase in a more direct way. 
Too much deflation will fuck your shit up. Bad shit will happen to the economy. We've observed this throughout history. 
So, therefore, the current theory is that a bit of inflation is better for the economy. We see this time and time again as well.

This person is correct. The phenomenon is called the money multiplier effect.
Botb's comment is basically all made up and incorrect. But hey, who cares about real economics when we can just blindly hate the banks?

Very few economists know and/or care about Bitcoin. It really isn't that surprising that they wouldn't know all the ins and outs, even if it is the K-man.

What? 500 for 5tb versus 2tb for 100?
What an odd pricing structure.

Nope. Didn't misread. 
I was speaking to this line:


Was just a joke.
Edit: saying if he was giving out bitcoin tips and whatnot, is what I meant.

Doesn't make sense for the boss to make him redo a project though.

They already have. 
It's called ads. It may not be a direct payment of the search, but it allows them to target ads to people.

So, I'm not a developer in *any* way, but why would there be a problem? The IOS mail app can report 10,000 unread emails perfectly fine. Is it different for non-apple apps? Or?

Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh. I know what you mean.

I agree with most of what you're saying, but a couple points:


Keynes' book, The General Theory, was not published until 1936. That was late into the depression (right before the double dip occurred, if memory serves). Besides, many other economists had to contribute to Keynes' theories before they were considered well rounded.


You really did not see anything like that....because that is absurdly incorrect. Go look at that chart I mentioned again. Where are you pulling this statistic from?
You should have added that 0% inflation is just a ridiculous notion. Not to mention a bad thing.

PPP has a lot to do with demand for said currency, not just the expansionary policies of central banks.

To be fair, if Mormons rode around knocking on doors and handing out cash, I would totally answer my door.
