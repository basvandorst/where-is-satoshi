Other than because it looked pretty, gold had few uses until recently. (Have a look at the [wiki page]( nearly all of its uses in manufacturing are modern). Yet, it's been valuable for far longer, due mostly to scarcity and the fact that it was viewed as valuable by others, so others in turn viewed it as valuable.

I remember that one. There was something about how having your computer even slightly farther away from the stock exchange's servers than someone else could cause you to lose money, so people were renting buildings as close to the exchange as they could. Eventually they just let traders set up their computers next to each other inside the exchange. And made sure they all had exactly the same length of cord.

"Decentralized trust"
"Distributed trust"
"Allotted trust"
"Shared trust"
"Sectioned trust"
Just throwing some ideas out there. Dunno if any will stick.
**EDIT:** It'd be worth looking at the [Separation of Duties]( and [Two Man Rule]( wiki pages to see if something catches the eye (How about "Separation of Trust"?)

He's probably confused because at one point it was the largest in the world, but has been surpassed since then. So it's now known locally as the mall that 'used to be the largest in the world'. He's probably confusing 'the world' with 'North America'.

Python is probably the most common for reddit bots. There's a module called PRAW that makes it easy. Check out if you want to know more!

You know Reddit allows everyone to save comments now. Don't even need gold for it.

They did the same thing with Facebook. Then Twitter. Every news segment involving one of them had to be led with an explanation of what it was. Now, it's just assumed that everyone knows. I'd give it a year or two before it stops requiring an explanation, so long as Crypto keeps making the news.
