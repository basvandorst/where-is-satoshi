As a somewhat new guy(reading up for a couple years but just recently had the resources to get some) does this mean NO transactions are possible or viewing the the blockchain isn't possible? Or something else

Wow really, this is mind boggling. Nvm no it's not I had the same thought when I first heard of it. Check out khans academy bitcoin playlist and the most recent bitcoin topic by Josef molynuex (sp) it's really a game changer for the economy.

Honestly that would fill up my tank for 2 weeks(I don't have a long distance to work) 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:29:16
I see, thank you and yup to the NSA having that info~
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:48:59
Wow ! Thats fucking quick! \^_^
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:55:55
I've been reading up and studying bitcoin for the past 8 months...guess I should invest a little...need a new job though...anyone interested in a electronics/radio technician with good people skills ?
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:33:06
Ignore the downvotes, what makes you think that?
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:16:22
Only half of him
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:52:58
Doesn't appear he was upset to me either..
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:54:53
It's not a thought of being a millionaire it's a thought on changing the world. If he believes in BTC then he should buy stuff with bitcoin or use it to pay people to get the word out.

That's the difference between people like us and people like them. They have a mediocum of self respect and integrity. I would have kept it sure, but I'd know I'd done wrong. However to call them idiots is to call yourself scum. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:29:52
Correct I didn't, I automatically assumed that they were the government saying they could pay back loss and didn't know that they have 0 money appropriated to them from the gvnmt. Thanks for pointing it out granted I don't trust the man and assume the worst at every possible scenario /^_^
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:44:02
He also said something of the extent of all knowing etc..
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:31:23
Except they won't because they can't print more BTC :/
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:56:33
F ya man, is hrd to typ all lttrs.
Ouch, my brain hurts from typing that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:37:09
Hmm if I remember correctly he's saying there are 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 possible keys
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:11:31
Wow that was amazingly good resource and I'm at work so I could t watch but just listening It makes so much more sense.

Account is 3 hours old and both messages are identical...zzz
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:04:26
I just replaced intrinsic value with "shiny"
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:19:53
I work at a gas station and talk to a lot of my customers about bitcoin and I'd say about 0.5% of the people I mention have heard about ti and if they have they are 1.) Misinformed 2.) Extremely behind the times.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:33:25
Non programmer here(also i dont exactly how BTC works)How about a system that stores the actual bitcoin locally, uploads an "image" to the server(think of the cloud) and the system verifies the BTC without the server actually seeing it(they only see a confirmation from whatever is used to confirm the BTc). 
This might be how online wallets work but you could tie it in to a bank account or something. Anyway just an idea to hopefully stir up a genius to making something amazing :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:15:33
Thank you for reminding me of Tenacious D. I had completely forgot about them. I'll proceed straight to youtube for some good listening :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:32:44
That's because you own over 100% of them and its past year 2140. They had no value and you can't sell them
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:13:35
I opened it on my phone and it worked without trying to get me to register, real good read considering I know barely anything about it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:04:02
I've been reading up on btc and I thought it was anonymous, would someone care to explain how it is not anonymous?
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:55:36
Haha dude here, but I'm way way behind on bitcoins I just like to educate myself. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:15:30
That's how much I have!

Um...if someone destroys your head how do you get it back from a backup?
