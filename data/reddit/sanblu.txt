You don't have to open a channel to each entity you want to transact with. You just open a single channel to anyone on the network and the subsequent payments are routed via the network to any recipients. So yes, you could send me a tip via lightning and you would not have to open a dedicated channel for that.

@_date: 2015-12-30 13:14:14
And here comes another post that tries to dumb down the discussion and depict the core devs as evil overlords.
In contrast to the people writing toxic posts on reddit they have been and still are working their asses off in order to improve bitcoin, just have a look at the dev mailing list. Without these improvements there would not even be a situation in which we could "discuss" blocksize increases.
Besides that, where do you see devs (or even any dev) say that block size should remain low forever? What &lt;bramc&gt; states in your linked post is merely what we already know: For now no hardfork blocksize increase has been agreed on, so the 2x SegWit bump is the only increase planned in the roadmap. As far as I know not a single dev intends to keep the 1 MB limit (or 1.75 - 4 MB after SegWit) forever.

Lightning network is still backed by and does not work without the Bitcoin blockchain.
If we assume real mass adoption something like 100 mb blocks on the main chain + lightning sounds to me more like a reasonable plan than 10 GB blocks (and a blockchain size in the order of peta bytes) without lightning. We have to find ways of scaling Bitcoin up without destroying its central value proposition of being a decentralized network.

Payment channels and the lightning network are built *on top* of Bitcoin. Think of of the lightning network as a caching layer that allows Bitcoin to scale by a factor of multiple magnitudes while still having the property of being trustless (due to having the blockchain as a backbone).
The network effect of Bitcoin is exactly what is at stake when the devs don't find a compromise. Having two competing forks sounds to me much worse than what is being proposed by either side.

This is of course a completely biased view advocating for bigger block size, not the summary of the both camps as OP asked for. Nevertheless it will be upvoted to the top. OP, if you want to find the arguments of the other side you should probably scroll down to the bottom as these views get regularly downvoted to oblivion. If you want to find some serious discussion on the topic by people that actually have a clue I recommend you have a look at the bitcoin-dev mailing list.

Are you assuming 13.33 MB is the upload bandwidth required for a node by 2036?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:24:35
Of course each altcoin is advertising as having the most powerful state of the art revolutionary tech. But that's just marketing speech. In reality none of them have come up with some magic scaling solution and the reason altcoins are "working" is that they are not under load. A few years ago transactions fees were almost zero also for Bitcoin, not because the tech at that time was better than today but simply because there was not enough demand. 2nd layer protocols seem to be the only feasible way for scaling up decentralized blockchains and here Bitcoin still has the lead with multiple lightning implementations now in alpha status. Ethereum is working on similar things (raiden, sharding) but do not seem to be progressing faster than bitcoin. So, yes, high fees suck.. but the really revolutionary tech does not get built overnight. But luckily lightning is very far already, 2018 will be very interesting.
@_date: 2015-06-14 08:13:50
If you think you can do a better job just start coding instead of constantly throwing dirt at the people who have been working hard for years at improving Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:52:32
I don't know how to properly estimate/calculate this, but I would expect the orphan rate to be very high with an upload bandwidth of just 3x bc growth rate (as it would take several minutes just to propagate a block from one node to the next). Somewhere I picked up 30 seconds as target for uploading which does not sound too unreasonable, in that case it would be 20x growth rate. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:33:22
I don't understand why you are being downvoted. I find it very frustrating that some people try to dumb this discussion down to simplistic viewpoints "keep bitcoin artificially restrained" vs "remove the cap and let bitcoin scale to whatever we want". Everybody wants to scale Bitcoin, the question is *how* and *how can we do so while retaining Bitcoin trustless and decentralized*.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:58:08
If we could just get rid if all these evil core devs that hate bitcoin so much and want to prevent it from scaling up...
Things are not as simple as you think they are. All Gavin, Mike and the core devs have valid arguments for/against block size increase. This is not about hidden agendas or core devs wanting Bitcoin to fail.
If you by "selling his other tech" mean the lightning network, this would be a protocol *on top* of Bitcoin, not *replacing* it. I think its a good thing we have intelligent people constantly thinking about how to improve scalability of Bitcoin, even if it is about a protocol on top of the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:33:13
I don't see your point. I'm saying that if we want Bitcoin to go mainstream we eventually need to be able handle VISA level transaction volumes in some way. VISA is not trustless, that is exactly why it is much harder for us to scale up than for them.
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:23:56
No need for name calling here. Both sides have good arguments for/against increasing block size. I'm sure eventually they will find a compromise.
In any case let us not pretend increasing the block size solves the scalability issue. This is just kicking the can down the road. If we want Bitcoin to be used as a mainstream visa kind payment backbone we need to scale by a factor in the order of 10000s. My impression is that we can only do that by building second level protocols on top of the blockchain (e.g payment channels, lightning).

@_date: 2015-06-07 09:58:52
Regardless of whether block size should be inreased or not (I see the arguments on both sides): Gavins proposal of inreasing the block size does not make Bitcoin scale, he himself described this as kicking the can down the road. Real solutions such as lightning network or something similar will be needed to eventually scale Bitcoin up.
@_date: 2015-12-04 09:52:22
This sounds like a really complex system with many moving parts with each part opening up a whole set of challenges. For the scaling conference I would assume that this high level description of the system is not specific enough. if the author has worked out the details the best thing to do imo would be to start a prototype implementation.
@_date: 2015-06-22 09:34:22
That might be true, although arguably the same applies to the blocksize posts.
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:39:43
Thank you, this feedback helps me a lot! I will think about how I can integrate some kind of comment/discussion system. (Hopefully I will find something that I can integrate without having to build everything from scratch).

@_date: 2015-06-07 11:03:06
I totally see that argument. Maybe it makes sense to kick the can down the road just to buy the devs enough time. I'm positive the devs will find a compromise here. 
I also really hope the witchhunt style posts accusing people like nullc of having hidden agendas etc come to an end soon (or at least that such comments are not blindly upvoted). 
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:34:19
No, I was relating to transfer of a single block (not the full blockchain which by 2032 would be in the order of petabytes). What I meant is that people might think that 14 MB is the upload bandwidth required for a node by 2032. (Which would mean that uploading a single block would take 10 minutes which does not make much sense.)
@_date: 2015-06-23 11:32:16
The numbers that you see in sumBTCs list is basically just showing the blockchain growth per second. The upload bandwidth required for nodes would be a lot higher than that. If we assume that we want a node to be able to send a block to another node in 30 seconds, you can multiply that number x 20 to get the required upload bandwidth (e.g. 2148 Mb/s for year 2036).

Thank you for catching and properly handling my parsing exception!
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:29:28
No I don't think that is how it works. A higher orphan rate means a higher percentage of hashing power is lost instead of securing the network. If that would not matter we could also just decrease the block interval (while keeping difficulty) down to e.g. 1 minute or 10 seconds without any downsides.

@_date: 2015-06-07 10:46:17
Honestly, I am quite invested in Bitcoin and I would very much like to believe this, but from all the discussions I read I don't see how we can scale up without building second level protocols. Just doing simplistic back on the envelope calculation I would assume we would need GB blocks if Bitcoin were to go mainstream? Who knows what world will look like in 10 years, maybe that wont be issue then, or maybe we will have google like datacenters managing the blockchain (hopefully not). It seems to me that the blocksize increase is really just a temporary fix until real solutions such as LN are rolled out.
@_date: 2015-06-21 14:30:44

@_date: 2015-06-23 16:56:45
I don't think I understand, but maybe I'm just confused. If a node had only 109.2mb/s upload bandwidth that would take 10 minutes for a single node to upload 8192 MB of data (a single block). I don't see how the block can be propagated through the network if it takes a single node 10 minutes to upload the amount of data required for a single block.
Anyway, I don't want to steal any of your time, you have more important stuff going on than giving me a Bitcoin introduction course (thanks for your hard work!).
Also I don't want to spread any misinformation, so I'm definitely going to read up on gossip networks first and have a look at the attached paper.
@_date: 2015-12-23 21:49:34
OP asked for a summary of the arguments of each side. I cannot find a single argument in your "summary" that is an argument against an immediate blocksize-increase.
That said I think your post summarizes pretty well what many here think, most seem to support an immediate blocksize increase with arguments along the lines of your summary.
If there are people new to bitcoin reading your arguments, I'm sure they must think that devs are crazy not to increase that single constant. After all, it's just one single line of code right? Why do these devs want to keep bitcoin artifically restrained, what motives do they have?
In reality the debate is not as simple as your summary makes it out to be. Both sides have their arguments and there is big spectrum in between Gavins BIP 101 and "keep 1 MB forever".
So to complement your summary, here is an (also one sided) article that summarizes pretty well the viewpoints of devs that are reluctant to increase the blocksize immediately by a big margin: 
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:57:03
Hash power follows price, not the other way round. If it were the other way round bitmain  could for example just create their own coin (e.g. bitmaincoin) and get rich  by putting all mining power behind it. What would happen instead: people would not assign much value to that coin resulting in bitmain paying more for electricity than what their mined coins are worth. Instead of mining at a loss the miners would drop the hashrate until the equilibrium of coin price and electricity cost is reached. So hashrate naturally follows price.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:21:09
Thanks, just want to remark that the MB/s number might be misunderstood. This is just the transaction rate of the network measured in MB, not the bandwidth requirements for full nodes which would be much higher.
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:54:44
Miners currently get rewarded with 25 btc for finding a block (happens about once every ten minutes), this increases supply. Next summer the reward will drop to 12.5 btc effectively halving inflation, this happens about every four years until the total amount of 21 million btc reached.
edit: typo
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:07:12
I'm slowly but surely getting tired of this...  I have told you earlier that these numbers are misleading because many people think this is the required upload bandwidth (which would be around 20x higher than the blockchain growth rate), and by now I have seen many examples of that as for example the post I'm replying to.
Even though it does not fit the narrative, can you at least please indicate in the same post that this is the blockchain growth rate and not the the upload bandwith?
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:06:58
Sorry if my previous post has been wrong. To be honest, I still don't understand where I'm wrong and what upload bandwidth is actually required by nodes in the 2036 scenario (8GB blocks).
If anyone can enlighten me I'm thankful :)

As I understand increasing the block size would actually benefit chinese miners since a majority of hashing power is on their side of the chinese firewall.

Your comment sounds as if disregarding latency issues and let "Bitcoin be Bitcoin" would punish chinese miners.
But by ignoring these effects we would effectively punish non-chinese miners. Since a majority of hashrate sits behind the chinese firewall (from a non-china perspective), disregarding latency issues would mean punishing miners outside the chinese firewall because blocks first have to travel through the chinese firewall.

I got into Bitcoin in 2013. Yes we are still not close to mainstream adoption but I also never had the expectation to be there so quickly. Building the backbone for a new financial infrastructure takes time and we are still in phase of building the infrastructure. Yet I'm still impressed every year by the speed with which things happen in that space. Also the perception of the media has changed, two years ago Bitcoin was still a "ponzi-scheme for drug addicts", two years later "Blockchain is going to change the world". I'm looking very much forward to see the state of the ecosystem in 5-10 years.

I strongly disagree. Bitcoin as we know it today has been built over the last years by incredibly talented and hard working individuals that have no interest in politics and want to build a system that is capable of changing the world. They did not need to hire marketing guys, buy facebook likes or pay lobbyists because they just did and still do what they like and think is best for Bitcoin. Their decisions are based on technical merit and their knowledge. You cannot put those guys in chains and ask them to implement whatever most reddit users have voted for, and that is good.

Unless you are talking about exchanges dealing exclusively with cryptocurrencies: Main reason is probably that exchanges need to deal with fiat which brings along all the problems of the old world. E.g. how can a P2P platform make sure that fiat has been successfully paid to person selling the cryptocurrency. In that case you need some kind of reputation system as well as possibility to escrow in case of disputes which is not an easy thing to do for a P2P platform.
I could imagine that openbazaar will be used as cryptocurrency exchange since it seems to come with all the necessary ingredients.

Segwit acts as a multiplier for effective blocksize. As such it increases the effective block size to initially 1.6 MB (later more depending on the types of transactions in the blocks).
But that said, I would also prefer to have everyone united again, a hard fork civil war could throw us back a lot. Also I don't trust the Bitcoin Classic guys, to me it seems to be mainly a marketing stunt without actually having capable developers required for such a project.

If we could double our earnings by forking bitcoin you would just have invented the perpetuum mobile of money. But.... unfortunately we cannot just become billionaires by forking bitcoin all day. That would be about the same as melting down a gold coin, forging two coins out of that and then saying you are now richer because you have now two coins instead of just one as before. If bitcoin forks the market cap in terms of USD gets split (both coins will have a lower USD value than today's coin). If the fork is contentious (as it would be the case between Core and Classic) it is far from clear how things play out. It is very well possible that the price of two coins of each forks combined (after the fork) is less than the price of one coin before the fork. (Now we are still united, a contentious fork would lead to civil war like situation with two coins fighting for user base. Also try to explain to an outsider that there are now two incompatible versions of bitcoin, merchants need to decide which type of coin they accept, update their code etc..  it's all very chaotic.)

I'd agree with you if we'd be able track coffee purchases by let's say doubling the blocksize (Bitcoin just has to remain decentralized *enough*). But realistically we would need gigabyte blocks to be able to get visa level throughput and then I don't see how Bitcoin would not end up being controlled by a few big companies. At that point there would be no difference between Bitcoin and paypal (except that Bitcoin would be extremely inefficient in comparison due to its architecture which is built for a decentralized environment).
The good news is that by building trustless 2nd layer protocols on top of Bitcoin such as LN we can come close to visa throughput levels without losing the decentralized nature of the system (block size will still need to be increased eventually to get to visa level throughput but increase can be more modest while giving magnitudes more throughput).

If you aren't able to recover the password, sorry for your loss. One (very mildly, I know) positive way of looking at it is the following: By losing your coins you have reduced the money supply and thus increased the value of the bitcoins of all other holders (even if just a tiny bit).

Very well explained! In my job as a software engineer I experience the exact same thing: Sometimes customers come to me with a very specific description of ui elements. As you do I then ask them to explain to me their business requirements which then often leads to quite a different but better solution than what they had in mind. It's not that software engineers are smarter than business people, but as a software engineer you are out of necessity used to think about corner cases and "problems down the road" that you run into if not thinking things properly through to the end.

Name: "Bitcoin Corn" would have very clear advantages!
a) It sounds a bit like Bitcoin Core, so it would probably get support from those who like Core but also from those who want something new. Majority guaranteed!
b) It also sounds a bit like unicorn, everyone loves unicorns!
It would be nice if people could vote via SMS on the block size. Each SMS would cost 1 dollar. The earnings from that could then be used  to pay the miners.
Edit: And here comes the downvote brigade of unicorn haters... ;) But just to be sure... I'm obviously joking.. like the work you do for Core Luke! :)

I would argue traders typically don't care about waiting for blocks. Traders are usually using instant centralized service for trading. So for example in bitstamp you have a bitcoin and a usd balance and you can swap between the two (a.k.a buying and selling) as you like without actually hitting the blockchain. Want to hedge against bitcoin volatility? Just press the sell button, no waiting for any blocks required.

Hey, we should just fork every second day, like that we are all going to be rich in just a few weeks! (Seriously, not sure if OP made a joke or really has no clue. Technically the amount of coins will double, but the value of the coins will split and in case of a contentious hard fork there is a very real risk that the combined value of coins in terms of usd on both forks will be lower than the usd value before the fork.)

1 MB is not definitely a magic number. People seem to be in agreement that 2 MB is more or less fine. With SegWit (implementation expected to be finished April afaik) the "effective" blocksize will initially be around 1.7 MB, there is wide support from wallet developers. In the future we might have things like fraud proofs, weak blocks etc which should allow to increase block size further. Medium to long term layer-2 protocols such as LN will allow Bitcoin to scale to levels that would otherwise require decades of exponential blocksize increases up to gigabyte blocks as it was proposed by BitcoinXT.

No, the paper explicitely states that block size currently should not exceed 4 MB.

@_date: 2016-01-27 10:41:17
SegWit acts as a multiplier for the effective block size. So with respect to transaction capacity 1 MB + SegWit is about the same as a block size increase of something like 1.6-2.0 MB without SegWit (depending on transaction types). So asking for an increase to 2 MB after SegWit is effectively asking for 4 MB blocks. (I'm not saying one or the other is better, just to point out that SegWit already comes with a capacity increase.)
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:11:45


I think it's rather the opposite way: Miners have to mine what has value. And value is decided by what users are willing to pay for a currency on the exchanges. (That is why ETC could be kept alive, people were willing to pay for it on exchanges which in turn lead to miners mining it for profit.)
I agree that miners (or some) are currently able to block SW, but that's only because the code written by devs requires the miners to signal for the soft fork (it is not intended as a vote but rather they are required to signal readiness). I'm not sure how things will play out if those miners continue blocking. Should the community split the price of both coins will be decided by us when we buy/sell on the exchanges.

Ok, I see what you mean. What you mean by "doubling" is the same a Bram means when he says "split". Imo using the word "split" makes more sense because you split/double your coins into two different types of coins.  Of course you will still have 10 Bitcoins of type A and 10 Bitcoins of type B, if you had 10 Bitcoins before the fork. But the value of these coins will not be the same as before the fork, since you have now two types of Bitcoin competing with each other. If neither of two types dies VERY quickly (which Bram argues won't happen) you end up in a chaos bringing down the value of both coins.

Also most people in this sub including me will recommend you not to day trade as this is not much different than a casino, big whales can move the market a lot.

Of course, Bitcoin is designed as a voluntary system, not a miner dictatorship. Devs write code, users decide which code to run, miners decide on which chain to hash. Miners are free to mine on any chain they want (they usually choose the most profitable one, which is given by how each coin is valued on exchanges), but they have zero control about what software people run.

Coinbase doesn't earn money with either onchain or lightning transactions, mostly they just earn money by taking a fee when users buy/sell bitcoin. What they need to care about is growing the eco system. Segwit comes with a short tearm capacity increase (about 2x transactional capacity) but more importantly it provides a solid base for future growth by solving transaction malleability (and as such enabling 2nd layer protocols such as lightning), solving the quadratic sighash problem, making life easier for hardware wallets. 
Regarding flextrans I think you'd have a hard time finding respected developers supporting your statement that segwit is "technically inferior".
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:52:08
So you're saying we should not adopt this, because it does not get adopted?
Yes it does increase capacity.
I don't know when you talked to Mycelium, but they wrote a blog post in November where they wrote that basic segwit implementation is finished.
Adoption from developer side looks good:

Calling the original chain a 'ship going down' is advocating for 2x.
If a few guys in suits can fire pretty much all current core devs and unilaterally decide to change consensus rules then Bitcoin is already dead. But I don't see it that way, in the end it's us users determining the value of each fork by buying or selling on exchanges and running nodes, hashpower is forced to follow price unless miners want to mine at a loss.   
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:01:55
That's the correct way to do it. Much better to first dip in your toes and gain some knowledge rather than right away throwing money at something you don't understand (that's exactly what seems to be happening with many ICOs right now).

To those who think hardforking the network is a superior approach: What are you waiting for?  Just throw your client out there with whatever properties you like and let the network fork.

You're right but so far their response to these kinds of questions has always been the same: It's in the agreement.

Bcash code base has already moved away significantly from the Bitcoin code base since they have already removed Segwit. So everything built in the Bitcoin code base that relies on Segwit will not be applicable to Bcash anymore. Over time the projects will diverge more and more which makes it impossible for them to just copy-paste what core has implemented.

It depends on what you understand by settlement. The whole trick behind Lightning is that you are swapping smart contracts offchain which are backed by the Bitcoin blockchain. This is why payments are instant yet much more secure than zero confirmation payments. The smart contract based lightning payment is like a receipt/guarantee that allows you to settle on chain, but the nice thing is you don't have to do it for every single payment. You could transact 10000 times, after each of those transactions you have a valid receipt that allows you to settle on chain, but you can also just use your latest receipt to settle all transactions in a single on chain transaction.

Valid is not subjective at all, it's the consensus rules as programmed in the Bitcoin clients that people run. If S2X is pushed through then the network will split and we will have two different chains which are both valid only for their subset of clients. What ends up being called "Bitcoin" is up to us people participating in the ecosystem. I will keep calling the core chain "Bitcoin", you are free to do the same or not.
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:09:43
I fully agree that there are (unfortunately) not that many that understand the code in-depth and all the intricacies that come with it. Take me for example, I'm a professional software developer and I earn my money writing software every day but I'm far far away from having just a part of the skills required for Bitcoin core development. Doing that stuff is really hard and a tiny mistake can destroy billions of dollars and thousands of businesses. But that problem is neither caused by nor the problem of the core devs. 
Regarding hard forks: I consider splitting a 10 billion dollar economy into two sets of incompatible flavors of a token very risky unless practically the whole ecosystem agrees on the change. Trying to explain Bitcoin to unfamiliar people is hard enough as it is, but try to explain them the situation after a fork when there are now multiple flavours of Bitcoin incompatible with each other. Ethereum has gone through this exercise once, how will things look the next time this happens? Will there be Ethereum / Etherum New Classic / Etherum Classic / Ethereum Classic Classic? In general I think there is no problem with crypto currencies branching out like that, but it can of course lead to very confusing situations and the network effect gets diminished.
But that said, here again, no one will prevent anybody from forking Bitcoin and publishing a client with different consensus rules. If any team of developers are convinced they can build a better crypto currency either by building something from scratch or forking the Bitcoin core code: Just go for it and publish the client. The hard part is convincing the rest of the ecosystem that this new client and developers maintaining this client are in fact much better than the existing client and team. If they really are, people will flock to it and the token will have value. This is a free market in which you can be as experimental as you want. If someone thinks core is doing a bad job nobody is able to prevent that person from publishing competing software and that's a good thing, but at the same time this does not give that person the right to dictate core devs what they should do.

I don't think the reason people are using the Bitcoin Core client is because they have the biggest market share. It's not like there is a monopoly that core could take advantage of. Nobody is forced to use their client and anybody can fork the code and modify it or try to build something better from scratch. If it has merit it will grow in value over time.
I've been following this space since a bit more than 3 years and imho times have hardly ever been more exciting than today. Segwit activation is around the corner and first second layer protocols are in the starting blocks. Tons of soft fork ideas are floating around (Schnorr, MAST).

21 Mio. is also magic number, chosen by Satoshi. Do I have to trust Satoshi? Is bitcoin less trustless because of that? No and no. I can just take it for what it is, a number defining a characteristic of the system. Then I can think about whether this characteristic makes sense or not.
In the case of the 21 Mio. coin limit it makes sense because scarcity is a necessary property for Bitcoin to be useful.
The 75% discount for the witness part makes sense too because it aligns incentives for reducing the UTXO set. Or in other words: For the free market to function properly the rules of the game have to reflect the actual external costs. People consuming less resources should have to pay a lower price, otherwise the system's incentives are not correctly aligned.

Assuming you don't do anything and the losing fork is abandoned quickly aren't you making second since you end up with a stash of worthless coins that you could have sold right after the fork? And if so, aren't you at a disadvantage if you cannot sell at the time of the fork (e.g. because you are at work).. ?

Is this some kind of propaganda campaign? This is now the third post of that kind just within the last few hours. These claims seem ridiculous to me considering XT is an exact copy of core with only the blocksize change (plus some other non performance related things).

They had a lot of fuck ups in the past (e.g. problems with random generator), just search bitcoin reddit history. That's why I would not trust them with my money. If you want to feel comfortably safe my recommendation is to use a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:07:54
Yes I agree, it's probably safest to do nothing while things play out. But I think we should also say that this might not be the optimal strategy to retain the value from before the fork. (They will have the same number of coins as before the fork, but the coins might be worth less.)
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:20:33
But it's a valid point. If you want to retain your USD value it would make sense to sell your coins before the fork and rebuy once things have played out. I don't want to gamble and right now I am quite clueless about what strategy I should chose if the fork becomes reality.

They could have sped up the process earlier by not signing up for and supporting a highly contentious project designed to be as disruptive as possible resulting in a guaranteed chain split. Also, not handing over decision about which chain to call BTC to a centralized chinese miner would probably help too.

My thoughts exactly. I have not sold since 2013, seeing the price go down was not fun but did not worry me too much since the whole ecosystem progressed very well. If the blocksize "debate" continues in such a confrontational manner things might get really messy.

Something doesn't grammar
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:44:41
After the fork you will basically have two independent stashes of coins, one stash for each fork. If one stash quickly loses its value as you say, wouldn't it be advisable to sell the coins of the losing fork (right after the fork) and use that money to buy more coins of the winning fork?
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:04:12

I did not mean to insult you, sorry.
It's just that there is simply no difference in the core vs. XT code that would explain such a difference, so the error must be in your measurement procedure.
Core and XT are using the same files on disk, did you make sure to clean all those files left over from Core before starting XT? (In that case XT would just have reused those files instead of redownloading.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:47:02
Not sure if you are joking or actually trying to mislead people. XT is a 99.9% copy of core differing only in the blocksize consensus behaviour (and some minor things).

That's a good remark and well explained, thanks! So the reason for the long forks was not so much the early mining before the block validation, but rather that blocks were not validated at all. Well.. that gives me a much better feeling, since in that case the incentives are aligned and we can hopefully expect miners to learn and validate blocks in parallel.

@_date: 2016-02-10 19:41:46
Yes that's correct, they would be perfectly compatible in the sense that there would not be a fork. My point was rather that the 2 MB bump cannot be combined with SegWit as proposed as this would leave us with a much bigger and unsafe effective block size increase than either the classic or core proposal by itself.
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:04:24
I strongly disagree that this would be a non-event. First of all I think that the price will drop a lot before an actual hard fork (relative to the rising likelihood of a fork). Personally I never thought about selling since 2013, but if a fork becomes likely I don't want to carry the hot potatoes in my hand when it happens and even if I did not sell beforehand I would certainly not sell the CoreCoins and keep the ClassicCoins. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person on earth thinking that way.
That said I still see at as very unlikely that it actually comes to this situation. Miners seem conservative and so far I don't have the impression that they would want to risk a civil war for a change that an overwhelming majority of the technical community disagrees with.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:01:16
Yeah, I really like Matt's proposal as well. It would allow us to have the segwit benefits, a small block size kick-the-can-down-the road bump to give us more time to solve things properly (IBLT, fraud proofs etc.) and nobody would have to lose their head. Also we don't risk a contentious hard-fork and we don't send a big FU to the core devs who have imo done a tremendous job over all those years.
Regarding the 8 MB, I think that number is outdated (that was a reply given by the miners to the initial 20 MB XT proposal) before thorough research was done. I remember to have read that the consensus among miners after jtoomin asked around was somewhere around 2-3 MB max.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:32:35

@_date: 2016-02-04 19:45:53
I perfectly understand that if there is a fork my bitcoins (bought before the fork) will be spendable independently on either fork. I'm not afraid of losing my coins on either fork, I'm afraid that the value will massively drop due to the uncertain civil-war like situation.


That chain will be Bitcoin *but only according to the rules of classic*, core nodes will see that chain as invalid, for them the 25% fork is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not just the longest chain but the longest *valid* chain which is not the same for Classic vs Core. That's why we end up with CoreCoins and ClassicCoins.

@_date: 2015-07-06 16:39:13
On the other hand: If the reduction of the orphan rate outweighs the risk of mining on the wrong fork then not validating the transactions might still be the more profitable strategy. (I have no idea if and under which circumstances that is the case, just saying.)
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:27:19
Currently the probability for an actual fork is pretty low, I think the price will be a lot more "suppressed" once (or if) that probability starts to rise.
I agree that the price might surge once this situation is resolved, but I don't expect the situation to be resolved with a fork. At that point things will just start to get interesting. What do you expect will happen after the fork? Pretty much all the technically talented guys (who kept Bitcoin running without major incidents over the last 7 years) are working as part of the Core team. I don't expect them to line up behind jtoomin. Those guys will simply continue to do whatever they think is best for Bitcoin regardless of what the jtoomin survey website says and there would be enough people like me that would continue to support them. But that said I still think it is very unlikely that it comes to a fork at all.

Hello 5-day old account
@_date: 2016-02-10 17:11:56
I have not downvoted you, but here is my explanation: A 2 MB bump (classic) and the capacity increase of the core roadmap (segwit) as it is being implemented are not compatible with each other. Taking either of them is safe but combining both would lead to a multiplicative increase which is a lot higher than what is considered safe by pretty much anyone on both sides. So, yes, core could embrace the 2 MB bump but only at the expense of dropping their current segwit proposal which they see as a superior solution as it provides both a short term bump and a basis for real scalability solutions.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:21:42
Changing both the MAX_BLOCKSIZE and implementing SegWit as proposed are not compatible with each other because you would end up with an *effective* block size increase that is a lot higher than 2 MB, which is not deemed safe (by either side).
The following would be a compromise that would allow for both a bump (1.5 MB) and segwit capacity increase (50% instead of 75% discount), which combined would result in a safe *effective* block size increase:
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:02:08

In case of a chainsplit and if I'm using a light wallet I would rather want to have my wallet let me take a conscious decision on which chain to transact instead of just pushing me to one chain (potentially without me even knowing there was a chain split). Arguable it would be better for the wallet to stop doing anything rather than switch to an arbitrary chain.

The article suggests that only miners have skin in the game and that that they are the only ones that really have to choose. I would argue that we as users have just as much skin in the game since we have to decide in case of a fork which coins to keep and which to sell (including keeping both, selling both or anything in-between). Ultimately it's the users deciding the value of the coins on each fork and therefore incentivizing or punishing miners on each fork.

From the paper linked in the arcticle:


... umm, and what exactly is the alternative? Should highly technical design questions be decided by social media surveys? And then we enslave the developers and force them to implement whatever the internet mob has ruled?
I highly doubt Bitcoin would be where it is today if we had replaced technocracy with politics and democracy for design decisions. Also everybody that thinks that the current developers are doing a bad job can fork the code and compete or join/support any other team that they think does a better job.

Some feedback:
* It would be nice to see some info on how the trust score has been determined.
* Strange that Poloniex a better total rating than Bitstamp even though Bitstamp has higher trust score and better ratings than Poloniex?
* Info on costs/fees would be helpful too.
* Personally I would not put Coinbase to the top of the list. Posts from unhappy users seem to come up all the time on reddit and Fred Ehrsam was putting Bitcoin openly into a bad light just recently. But that's just my opinion.

 Introducing some kind of consortium to manage a blacklist of tainted coins would effectively mean destroying bitcoins fungibility. If this were to get popular, everyone would be forced to check against the blacklist(s) in order to be sure not to receive inferior "lower value" bitcoins, even when not agreeing with the actual blacklist(s) contents. Besides making the technical architecture more complex and less scalable this also means we have now replaced a simple mathematically sound trustless system with a political process of a managing blacklists that requires trusting the entities managing them (which could very well be corrupt governments trying to shut down dissidents or big corporations protecting a monopoly).

It will mean an automatic chain split and split of the ecosystem for Bitcoin. We can have a look at different parts of the ecosystem: Devs, Companies, Miners, Users. Miners (mostly Jihan) are the only ones which currently are clearly in favour of 2x, but they are the least important because at the end of the day they will have to mine what has value which dictated by users. Regarding companies: There are few that signed the NYA but there are also ones against it and there are many unknowns, especially the exchanges (I haven't heard a word from most exchanges even after personally contacting them). Regarding devs: The ones that have built and improved the protocol over the last 5 years are overwhelmingly against Segwit2x, so who will maintain the new Bitcoin fork? Will Jeff Garzik implement Schnorr signatures? I'm absolutely certain that core won't just let a few guys in suits decide behind closed doors what they have to implement and that's a good thing. Regarding users I don't know, my impression is that there are many users like me that have been part of this ecosystem a long time and that don't have any interest in replacing the current open meritocratic development process with closed door meetings by a few CEOs. Also I don't know how Segwit2x intends to replace all the knowledgeable people that are currently developing the protocol? One could argue that it might be a good thing that Bitcoin will split, but to think it won't split with Segwit2x would be very naive.

I don't think they will follow through but I'd welcome if they do. And if they do my gut feeling tells me the first change to the code base will be something that allows Jihan to further use covert AsicBoost.

Many are looking forward to segwit getting activated. 2x hardfork in november is a different story.
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:50:31
No, rather support the bitcoin implementation which follows your goal of a libertarian free from gov and corp bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:25:51
A split of the chain, ecosystem and devs is not just a risk but a guaranteed outcome with segwit2x. And for what? A blocksize increase that gets rejected by an overwhelming majority of devs. Right now blocks are not even full and segwit would increase throughput by 100% even without 2x. This is not about blocksize anymore but about taking control of the protocol.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:31:48
Miners could just have activated BIP141 half a year ago. This would have gotten us to the same end result of segwit activation but without the whole circus inbetween. Hopefully things will go smoothly now and everybody can go back to building the infrastructure we need for the next influx of users. So in that sense, yes, thanks miners for finally not blocking segwit anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:28:18
All these poor core devs, they have been working on and testing this segwit thingy for a year if they could have just asked you for that trick with increasing the number. They must be terribly stupid, right?

Pro tip:
Then also sell all your fiat currencies for bitcoin.
After that sell your house, your car and maybe also your wife (if legal in your country).

Yes that's right

Nobody forces you to support or use the core client. Feel free to switch to e.g. Bitcoin ABC on first of August and compete with the market.

Give it some time, I'm pretty sure most of the ICO coins will fade away once people realize that not every of those projects is going to revolutionize the world or even just materialize . Right now you just have to say "ICO" and people will throw money at you regardless of your product (if there is one at all), team and chances of success.

Looks cool, ignore the troll (just look at the post history...)

That's fine, everybody is free to do whatever they want. Actually I think they should have done that already a long time ago. Now they can prove themselves and build their own thing rather than constantly coming up with conspiracy theories.

Chinese exchanges used to have no trading fees which meant even a single bot could generate a high volume by endlessly trading forth and back. As I understand PBOC made exchanges introduce trading fees earlier this year, so volumes should now be better comparable to volumes of western exchanges.

Miners could have activated Segwit a long time ago. Under today's conditions blocks are on average expected to be a bit bigger than 2 MB with Segwit, so that's even more than the people wanted at the time. (Segwit2x would raise this to 4MB avg. / 8 Mb max)
@_date: 2017-07-08 08:51:07
Yes sure, this is a voluntary system, devs are just putting the code out there but in the end each and every user is free to decide whether and which code to run. But still, miners are bound by the rules of the software run by the users. POW allows them to order transactions but does not give them any power to define consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-07-24 07:16:15
why no dilution? if you have two forks the situation is the same as with two competing altcoins, with a fork you have effectively *two* incompatible ledgers competing for market share. (if there were a core and a classic fork of bitcoin and both had 50% market share, the price for each coin would be reduced by 50% assuming the same amount of money is put into the ecosystem as before)
@_date: 2016-07-08 08:49:00
I don't see the option (from europe). But it sure looks like they stole the game's logo from ethereum, or the other way round :)
@_date: 2016-07-24 11:06:03
yeah that's right
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:38:10
Something like Segwit + Schnorr + 2nd layer + moderate blocksize increase sounds like it could do the trick. What would be the alternative? Increase blocksize to around 300 MB (Which is about what would be required to process 1000 tps without any of the above improvements. And even then, 1000 tps is still magnitudes away from what would be needed for global on-chain coffee purchases.)

A lightning network "hub" is simply a well connected lightning node (a node with many connections to other nodes). The article suggests that having a topology with well-connected nodes is the same as a centralized system based on banks which makes no sense. The author is playing with the word "centralized" to suggest that we must rely on trusted 3rd parties (such as banks) which is not true. The lightning protocol does not require any trust in lightning nodes or hubs (which again , are just well connected nodes). Hubs cannot steal any money. So if a bank wants to set up a well connected lightning node they are very much welcome to do so, they might earn a little bit of transaction fees for their service but they will not gain any centralized control and cannot steal the money they are routing.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:02:10
No, the miner's don't decide the rules. Rules are enforced by the nodes to which the miners have to comply. (Otherwise what would prevent the miners from unilaterally deciding to e.g. increase the block reward to 100 coins per block?)
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:24:01
Did Poloniex state they won't support BIP148?
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:40:54
I don't think developers are portable, I cannot imagine current core devs join a project against their will, a hardfork will for sure split the community and will be devastating for the price. I think a lot of people like myself will stay with core and the value of each coin will be decided by the users trading it on exchanges, miners will just mine whichever coin is most profitable. Hashpower follows value, not the other way round. If any of the big miners don't want to mine on the original Bitcoin chain anymore that just lowers the difficulty for other miners to jump in.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:18:53
These two arguments are typical fud arguments as they are spread by rbtc. "Small blockers" just have a different opinion on how to scale the network, there is nothing artifical about wanting to keep the base layer decentralized and even so segwit in its original form doubles actual transactional throughput.
Regarding your second comment: Please tell us *exactly* how Blockstream will greatly benefit from Lightning network being implemented as an open source project by about 5 different parties. Anybody can put up a lightning node, the system is as open as the bitcoin base layer itself and rather than taking something away from the base layer it makes it more valuable by enabling use cases otherwise not possible.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:53:16
I think the title is not quite correct. You can buy Bitcoin at ticket machines, but you cannot pay for the ticket with it.

Fantastic read, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:44:46
No, that's not what the whitepaper says. Miners are responsible for deciding the order of transactions. Full nodes are making sure the blocks produced by miners are valid according to the consensus rules. (Ask yourself what kind of system this would be if miners had the power to define the consensus rules. E.g. what would prevent them from simply increasing the miner rewards from 12.5 BTC to let's say 100 BTC?)
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:46:17
Again, how *exactly* will Blockstream benefit from lightning network being implemented open source by different parties?
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:46:45


@_date: 2017-06-20 05:49:53
Again, how *exactly* is Blockstream benefitting from open source lightning network implementations?
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:11:51
Not sure it's that simple. If most hashing power is in china they would not be orphaned, the chain would just get reorged. (e.g. assume theres a group of miners on the moon with a long transfer delay but overall more hashpower than on earth, from earth perspective initially it looks like moon blocks are orphaned, meanwhile moon miners expand their view of the chain which is longer from their perspective. Eventually earth chain is reorged because moon chain has more hashpower behind. )
@_date: 2016-07-22 11:56:28
I don't think you can add any other than those about ten available. I always just use one data source (bitstamp), spread is usually quite low among exchanges.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:36:13
If you don't own the private key or a hashed timelock contract you don't own the Bitcoin. Done, you're welcome :)

If a 20 MB block gets mined in china, how much time does it take for this block to be propagated to other miners outside the chinese firewall. What effect has this on profitability of miners outside the firewall (because they have to wait longer to receive the block) assuming most hash power resides within china? These are the kinds of scenarios that have to be considered here, it's not that simple to just increase block size without badly affecting the decentralization properties of the system. But assume we increase blocksize to 20 MB, now we have about 70 tps.  Visa alone has about 50'000 tps.. so we need more intelligent solutions than just a blocksize bump anyway (unless we find a way to deal with gigabyte blocks).
