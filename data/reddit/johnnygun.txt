Haha I thought bitcoins would put me in jail then... Oh how I wish I was less oblivious at the time.

powerful evian11.. powerful. i replied. and i love you for bringin this up to him.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:10:17
have you listened to any of the things he's had to say? close-minded ever?
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:21:06
Think about it.. Fiat rates and economies are crashing around the world.. Governments need this. It is capable of bailing people and govt out of some pretty shitty situations.

Just tell me your name isn't Bonavest and ill sleep ok.
For real though.. Sucks. I've lost a few btc worth of doge in the early doge days on dice.. Dice games are not worth it. I feel for ya homie.. Even though it was a horrrrrible idea.

+1000000000000  NONONO the logo is fuckin great already.. change it and btc drops to $.10
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:14:46
It was delayed, I w/d at 3pm yesterday. But btc-e wallet update made it late. Now like you said, ~130 transactions and nothing in my cryptsy wallet yet.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:03:47
I can't. Fuck em. If they wanna play with grown up money they can act like grownups. That's my two btc.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:13:45
My apologies I'm stressed and probably shouldn't be posting. You were right with the link, I was just one step back I believe. So, from what I understand, it is likely a cryptsy deposit issue. Sorry man, didn't mean to nip. Gonna sleep if off now.
Hope you have a good day, I didn't mean to start it off stupid like so.
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:51:22
did you read some of the posts in the link..? other people's w/d still haven't posted to blockchain. plus i did admit that. so get off your high horse.
btw.. it's not just btc-e w/d, it's bitstamp dep/wd and coinedup w/d as well. cryptsy is also experiencing deposit issues from btc-e, concerning my case.

it was the tone of the question. you entered a thread about joe rogan where people were enthused of a potential guest, and said.. "why the fuck does anyone care what he thinks"... so why the fuck should i care about what you think? i respect joe rogan.. i don't even know you..
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:03:17
you should look more into the main dev, it might surprise you.. also,
 they are calling for another "talented dev".. with what's on the horizon, i can only imagine that means good things.

fighting in the ufc is a sport, not barbarianism.. it's not rome.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:09:41
i know, i've noticed that. all my earnings since december, when i started. not happy man, and very nervous. 
one thing to note, i noticed this same address has been traveled through in the past, when withdrawing coins from btc-e.
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:47:37
Yup. When i had 5 btc tied up in the tx mall attacks several weeks ago i did some blocktree sluething myself. Noticed this, came up with with the same conclusion. If someone wants to move large amounts of coin and be on the downlow, this is the obvious route they would follow.
A lot of people don't know about the blocktree. It's a very useful tool.

rory mac is a beast. he fights intelligently, obviously he is intelligent financially as well.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:46:38
haha this is awesome. i shall now license every one of my pc's w/ malwarebytes due to btc payments.. incredible move man :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:08:18
update; removing this thread soon, as BTC-E has reprocessed w/d and they have succeeded for many people including me. thank you guys for weighing in, much appreciated. and major props to btc-e for coming through the tx malleability bullshit.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:00:41
fancy you popping up here.. hell yea david seamen.. discovered you via joe rogan experience.. you're fightin the good fight brother. i'll tune in to those ones for sure.
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:32:00
not true, it is now a problem on cryptsy's side. i have nothing pending and no coins. in which case isn't btc-e's problem  anymore, but other's are having the issue. read link.
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:01:24
Nobody, governments included, want the world economies to collapse. Maybe some would like to see it shift, but no one wants collapse. Satoshi Nakamoto may have "bailed out the world", and even governments may be intelligent enough to notice that his ideas are an evolutionary stepping stone of the old failing and extraordinarily manipulated corporately controlled financial, banking, and spending system.
On the other hand, I'm sure there are supporters and dissenters to BTC alike within governments.

listen to him talk.. he is an intelligent man who brings up a lot of interesting angles to interesting topics.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:03:20
if you're interested in intelligent domestic gov conversation, you'd be doing yourself a favor to look up the joe rogan &amp; david seaman episodes of joe rogan experience. he's an interesting guy who's fighting for the people.
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:31:14
i know there was a wallet update at btc-e yesterday, but does that really create a 20 hour (and building) delay? as of 3 hours ago, my coins finally hit blockchain, but still nothing even pending on the other side of the tx, even after 14 confirmations.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:09:27
my apologies.. you didn't cuss, it seemed like you implying negative undertones. if i was wrong, my apologies.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:11:13
omgodzorz!!!!!! cheap bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-08-14 04:26:37
Yea was thinking the same thing.  He was intelligent enough to invent the blockchain, I'm sure he felt banks would be involved someday, and many more institutions.
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:10:30
Good to know dude thanks.
@_date: 2015-04-14 00:37:25
Damn son you been working... Time for me to hit all the spots around me... There is a metric ****ton of unexplored suburbs around me.
Ps... Can't wait for direct BTC Wallet exports

Holy shit ROFL... I live 20 minutes away from Wolong!?!!
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:55:00
Yea +1 this. Watch the charts and make a gamble if you got a little money to throw. Remember, you can buy .xx of a bitcoin too and trade that down to alt currency for trading.. If you want to.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:12:04
You think its bad now.. Just wait till you see what's coming.
