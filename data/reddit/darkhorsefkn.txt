everyone who was paying attention knew BCH was about to be added to coinbase for at least 3 days if not a week now.  The CEO all but said so on TV and then the API screenshot showing BCH wallet added yesterday.
Honestly if this came as a shock its because you werent paying attention.

A 5 year old could google these sources with nothing but my post above to go on.  
If that's in your too hard basket you are going to remain a step behind

I am just some dude in his living room and I knew with certainty that BCH was about to be added to coinbase.
Watch the news guys.  The API came out 2 days ago.  The CEO might as well have confirmed it on TV 5 days ago I think?  If you were paying attention to what he said it was clear as day.
If I knew, then a lot of other people knew.

Who cares if it needs to exist?  What difference does that make to anything?  
It doesn't need to exist, but it does and being upset about it wont change that.  You sound like a petulant child when you argue in this way.
The entire cryptocurrency industry is about money, you dolt.  It IS money

This is the first time I have heard Ver is a miner, are you sure?

Can you explain about the EDA bug and how that happened or shall I look it up?
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:26:20
haven't read any reports like that.  Every one of these that I have seen, and there are many, has been someone who put coins on bittrex and then attempted verification after.
They also never mention their country of origin.  
I verified my account after depositing several coins.  I come from a country allied with the USA and I didn't attempt to withhold information or otherwise be dodgy on my verification, which took about 24 hours to process.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:27:01
What country are you in?  Did you provide the documentation bittrex requested?  Why do you think some people have these issues while so many do not?

Premined because it was created with a fork?  Is that what you mean?
I guess thats technically correct but premined makes you think the devs gave themselves x million coins at launch, which is not the case with BCH.  
Or do you mean something else?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:32:39
You cropped out the dates, this was wrong
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:45:28
I hope the price goes back up and you are able to make this back, really sucks when this sort of thing happens.

Your perspective is seriously out of whack. You are better off than almost every person who has ever lived.  The vast majority of humanity will never have the opportunity you have to do whatever the hell you want with your life.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:27:21
honestly, I wouldn't complain.  
As I said, your perspective is messed up if you think you are old and poor, when you are 35 and have a million dollars.   
I don't know you, but I find it disgusting that someone in your situation could be depressed about their lot in life.  
You should travel, go and see what the rest of the world is like.  This will give you perspective and if you really think you are poor move to a country like thailand and live like a goddamn king.
