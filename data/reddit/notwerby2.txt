Sounds on point. I am sending between electrum and another wallet. I made 2 transactions from coin.mx to my wallet today. The first one was small, .018, and it shows confirmed, green check, and blockchain shows 45 confirmations. The second one shows a clock, 3 confirmations. Then, i transferred .18 from the total amount, to a different wallet, and it shows pending, 0 confirmations. 
Blockchain says average confirmation time is around 15 minutes; its easily been an hour for the one with 3, and 30 minutes for the one still pending.

I got an email from coin.mx after asking what the error was:
According to the IT department, this is just one of the few isolated incidence when there is by a minor bug found on the bitcoin storage under huge loading. The system automatically rejects the transaction as part of a security protocol that has been placed on our system.
Just let us know if you encounter issues and we'll have our programmers fix them for your.
I hope this answers your question.
Thank you,

But you aren't using the credit card to make purchases, its just being used as collateral in case the ACH transfer doesn't clear. Not to mention they only accept visa, and i only have one card, which is mastercard. So if i have a discretionary spending fund i setup with its own checking account and debit card, that i use for my random purchases online, i still have to wait 4 days for it to clear, unless i go open a visa credit card. And even then, if for some reason i dont balance my books properly over the 4 days, i run the risk of bouncing my transaction. So stop acting like you know everything. 
Coin.mx charges a debit or credit card instantly, regardless of wether its visa or mastercard.

Well that's why i'm asking. Everything i learned about btc from researching to make the purchase talks about only buying exactly what you need for the purchase, spending it right away etc. 
So a cold storage device, would that mean something like a flashdrive?

Well that's why i'm asking, because at the moment, i'm still not quite sure how i feel about bitcoin. I tried to send 5$ worth of coin from coin.mx to my electrum wallet as a test, (since i'm new,) and it left my account, but showed an error message. Blockchain didn't show the transaction. I emailed them, and this morning it was put back, but the thought that a single computer error can cause currency to just disappear makes me nervous. I registered for both, because i was looking to use the coins that day, and coin.mx was able to confirm me for purchase, and get me what i needed right away. Now i'm just getting worried because of that incident, and the fact that everyone seems to talk about coinbase, not coin.mx.

Well as far as i know, it was released to my wallet. (How can i tell?) At first, electrum showed balance 0.xxxxxxxxbtc (0.xxxxxx unconfirmed) but the unconfirmed part went away as soon as it hit 2 confirmations.

Ok, so i guess the next logical question to help me learn / understand: what is the actual risk of leaving them on the site? How is it any different than if i put funds in my vanguard account, and leave them there? It is just cause the sites are not regulated the same way, and if they chose to dump my account, i couldn't do anything about it? 
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:00:23
Right, but aren't the confirmations what keep the currency ticking? Without those there would be no security or way to confirm validity of transactions.
That's why I'm asking if the confirmations on one transaction affect the next one down the line. 
Cause I'm showing the coins from coin mx, but the second transaction (shown as pending) hadn't even hit the blockchain after 35 mins. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:16:01
Got it. 
Do you think there will ever be bitcoin funds on mainstream investing broker sites like vanguard? I understand what they are, but i'm still trying to understand the implications of their use, on the world economy. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:44:51
Actually, i was here to ask all the people who use coin base why they do so, because to me, at first glance it didnt seem beneficial over other sites. But according to you, my question wasn't worth debate. You're the one posting know it all, sarcastic answers without even understanding my question.

Thanks for all the help thus far. By the time I got home from work everything went through. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:35:45
Fair enough. I'm by no means committed to them. I was still in the process of confirming my coinbase account. I just couldn't find any threads or info anywhere about one vs the other.

Well, i'm talking about vanguard cause last year i opened a roth ira, to save for retirement. Im 28, trying to get ahead of the game. But i buy index funds, and i do the slow and load, buy and hold and not expect to become super rich thing. But since stumbling upon bitcoins and seeing how much the currency is going up and down, especially since the introduction, as well as how unknown it is among most everyday folk, i feel like i have the potential to take a few thousand dollars and gamble. I know its certainly not unknown compared to when they were going for $30, but i bet 80% of the people on investing forums dont know much about it. I got a modest inheritance, and i still have most of it in a savings account till i figure out where to invest it. I would never bet 5k on black at a roulette table, but i would gamble it on an investment if i believed in. That's why i want to research.

Well that's why i'm trying to understand though, because right now so much of this is going over my head. That error is what inspired this original post, about coin.mx vs coinbase. Although i have since noticed how much higher the fee is to add money to coin.mx using a debit card vs ach transfer. Do you think an error like that is less likely to happen on coinbase? As it is i think i'm going to move my activity over to CB, it seems more user friendly.

Got another question: If i send coins from coin.mx to my electrum, and i only get 2 or 3 confirmations, and immediately send some of those coins somewhere else, does the fact there are only 3 confirmations on the first transaction mean it will take longer for the second one to confirm? 
As far as i understand, every time you send a bitcoin, the blockchain is checked backwards, to see if all the data entries match up, to ensure you have the coin. That's why i'm assuming if they didnt confirm step 1 thoroughly, it would take that much longer to confirm step 2. Or, are they not directly connected?  
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:19:24
Well that's why i'm excited to get out there now. If this is the future, i wanna get involved as early as possible so i can learn the ropes. I am aware of cold storage, as well as things like TREZOR, but i haven't learned enough of the basics to decide i need that stuff yet. 
It just killed my confidence when the first transaction i tried to send to my wallet disappeared lol. I mean, i got it back, but if i didnt have coin.mx to help, i'd be screwed. (Like if i was going between 2 of my own wallets, or a wallet to cold storage, etc.)

Would you consider electrum an intermediary? I have $250 leftover from my Christmas bonus that i dont really need for anything else, and i want to turn it to coins and move it to my electrum wallet so i have it for future use, whenever that time may be. I know people are making other suggestions for storing coins, but is there any serious risk in just using electrum? 
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:37:03
 So.... it doesn't take 4 days to buy coins?
