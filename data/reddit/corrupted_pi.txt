For a truly privacy focused OS, surely the project would need to be open source. 
For android I'd check out LineageOS (used to be cyanogenmod). I've been running it this whole year and have yet to have any issues. Its great.

What are these accredited sources you speak of? Millions seems awfully high..

If you're still holding that bitcoin - don't let go. It'll soon rise.

Any coins on an exchange should ideally be moved so you are in control of your own private keys.

Keep holding for a fortnight after the fork and keep an eye out on news.

The fork won't ruin it, it just means localbitcoins decide when to give you access to your forked coins. 
Also coins stored in any exchange are not long-term safe.

I'd argue a software wallet is considerably safer than coinbase. 
Any third party is respected up until the point they aren't. That's why BTC was conceived in the first place no? Once respected financial institutions etc etc.. 
But yes. For the average Joe wanting to get something out of the fork then holding via coinbase is easiest. Just remember coinbase users are yet to receive their BCH..

Localbitcoins. Get verified and do a bank transfer.

From my (very limited) understanding the risk goes like this;










So post-fork (any fork). Move your BTC to a new wallet (before you get your shitcoins) and you should be safe. 
I'm not 100% sure where the technical risk lies. I'm sure its to do with your address being published?
Please someone correct me if I'm horribly mistaken :)

What if my coin were in a blockchain.info wallet at the time or electrum?

Okay, Mr. Advice what about crypto (aside from ignorance in security measures) is inherently insecure?

Not when what has been said is sincere and are facts. Unlike the statements coming out of Jamie.
