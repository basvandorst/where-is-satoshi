I think it's pretty much been done.
On the topic of FPGA being more energy/space efficient than GPUs, I believe it:
But, I think ASICs would be a much better way to go:
See:  
There's no need for the flexibility that FPGA offers in this situation, which is pretty much it's main/only advantage over traditional ICs. Algorithms in bitcoin mining are fixed (for now and probably for a while).
@_date: 2013-02-26 19:58:56
That, but also I don't get why it's even such a hot-button topic. Using the term "scammed" seems a bit harsh to me. If so, it would be quite an elaborate and magnificent one: They delivered on their FPGA miners and it's clear they've put a lot of funds into marketing, case-design, purchasing pick&amp;place equipment with 3rd party photographic proof etc.
I think, "severely mislead," and possibly false-advertised to their customers is a bit more accurate.

I don't think comparing to Avalon ASIC's machine is a good enough argument for them reaching spec / I think that comment needs a better source. That's too apples vs oranges of a comparison. 
Performance for a given dimension (hash-power, energy consumption, etc), depends on what constraints you're trying to optimize over. Avalon engineered their miner to the constraint of time-to-market (a smart move, imo), whereas BFL clearly didn't take that route. It's possible that BFL can pull off much better efficiency given that they've taken the time to implement a better design.
I'm not using this as an argument that BFL COULD/WILL reach their spec - I'm just saying I don't think you've made a valid argument.
Last, everyone seems to gloss over that they did successfully design, manufacture, produce, and sell their series of FPGA-miners (terrible customer service aside), which happened to operate well within spec. In a ways, before Avalon proved themselves/(himself), BFL has the best track-record and was the safest bet out of any of the competition.

I was pretty skeptical of this, myself. They did make a pretty good point in their FAQ. Nonetheless, it does sort of come off as a "fund my life" project in their marketing. 
Is this a "fund my life" project?
A lot of people are misunderstanding what this project is about. The Kickstarter funds are going to fund a professional crew to film the feature length documentary. Beccy and I both have very successful professional lives. We have absolutely no need to live on bitcoin or get a free vacation. We will continue our day jobs. Taking on this documentary was a hard decision for us. We’re adding a a lot of work to our already busy lives. Good documentary films cost money, for filming, editing, expensive gear, and more. We’re doing this Kickstarter project to fund the film crew that will follow us for 3 months, then edit for months more making a professional documentary film."

To clarify what gotamd is saying:
Localbitcoins.com uses a transaction system, which works as follows:
(1) Alice offers online to purchase X Bitcoins for Y USD from Bob who is advertising his bitcoins.
(2) Bob agrees to the offer, and sends money to a special localbitcoins.com wallet address (called "funding the transaction"). Bob has to submit the right amount of the bitcoins for the transaction to be considered "funded."
(3) Alice provides a receiving address for her bitcoins, and a cell number
(4) Localbitcoins gives bob a private codeword, which can be used to SMS a localbitcoins phone which sends the funds to Alice. Bob should not share this code with Alice.
(5) Localbitcoins gives alice a private codeword (verification code), which localbitcoins will SMS to her when Bob sends her the coins. She shouldn't share this codeword with Bob. Because Bob doesn't know this codeword, and assuming localbitcoins.com is being trustworthy, she knows that Bob has to have sent her the bitcoins if she gets a text-message with this code from the localbitcoins 
(6) Alice and Bob meet in person. Alice hands Bob the cash (he should check for the right amount + that it's not counterfeit). 
(7) If it looks legit to Bob, he sends the secret code to localbitcoins. This releases his bitcoins to the address Alice provided.
(8) Alice gets a text-message from localbitcoins with her secret verification code, which says that the bitcoins have been deposited in the address she provided.
IMO Bob, should ask for the cash first. It's easier to run with the bitcoins and get away (cos they're not physically there), than it is to run away with the cash.

Disclaimer: I have nothing against selling, I just think there's a thinly veiled sell-signal going that people should be aware of. It's the awareness, not the message of buy/sell/hold that I care about.


Ah, but if you read what the OP has written closely, there is a subtle "sell" subtext. For example:


Which reads as: "Hey now, let's keep the discussion focused on trading+emotions, but oh by the way **Bitcoin's falling** and that **certainly isn't a good sign**. Did I mention I'm an experienced trader?"
Also OP's main point is also a subtle "sell" signal:


Translation: If you're holding, you're being "extremely biased" towards bitcoin


Translation: Being biased is a "serious mistake."


Translation: Bitcoin is crashing, but people still shout "hold it," which means you're being extremely biased towards bitcoin, which means you're making a serious mistake and being neglectful of a crash... by holding.^^(therefore ^^you ^^should ^^probably ^^sell).

Hmm - I'm thinking the B w/ Ethernet might actually be better in terms of trading off user-friendliness (being able to send/rx bitcoins should I need to) and security. Even though it's not as secure, I think the security should still be sufficient so as long as it's only plugged in intermittently for transfers and it's properly firewalled.

While your analysis could end up being correct (anything is possible), this is a pretty weak one. A hand-drawn plot and a screencap of trading data?
This post (and your post history - i.e. nothing), would make me say: be careful of people trying to manipulate using weak intuition with zero mathematical analysis. ;)
I think the general "shape" that's presented may be a decent hypothesis, but I find it irresponsible to just call out random numbers like that, even if it's where they end up settling.

I guess, saying "worth mining solo" was a bit of a simplification. If you assume a constant difficulty, then mining solo vs pool for a very long time should give roughly the same amount. Pooled mining essentially reduces the variance in the time it takes to generate income, as you're combining everyone's hashing power, which in turn increases the chance of finding a block.
It's a probabilistic process. Check this out:  -

Don't buy Bitcoins to make money, buy them if you believe in it as a concept that you want to see succeed. With that in mind, there's no such thing a bad time to buy Bitcoins. Any notion of Bitcoin as a monetary investment should be strictly considered a secondary potential bonus. 
The key corollary to this, of course, is only buy as much as you're willing to lose it all, should the system collapse.

As an aside (I know this article was a joke), Neuroengi grad student here: true mind-reading is NOT here. All of these EEG/fMRI techniques use supervised learning (you give the computer the answer first, to teach it what to look for - which needs to be done on an individual-by-individual basis), and it's for crude tasks (moving a mouse around the screen / eye-tracking).

**Very** roughly, it's playing a difficult computational lottery. The higher the difficulty, the lower the probability there is of solving a block. If you mine solo right now, you get the entire block reward (25 BTC), but it would take on avg ~500 days to solve ( w/ 800 MH/s. To generate a more regular income from mining, you can join a pool ( which is sort of like getting together with a bunch of friends to purchase a bunch of lottery tickets and then splitting the reward.

No. I'm saying that there is something irresponsible about just making that information free, promoting it, and easy to utilize before the *time* is right. Don't get me wrong, I think all information wants to be free and will be at the end of the day, but releasing and promoting that information before a society can deal with it in an effective beneficial and healthy manner will be detrimental to society at the end of the day. 
For example, we all know that Alan Turing-one of the founding fathers of modern computing-was a homosexual, a reason for which he was chemically castrated (among other things). Today, if someone went around yelling "Alan Turing is gay!!" nothing would probably come of it, and he'd go about doing his awesome great things for society. But if you were around during WWII would it have been responsible to go around releasing this information? It would have had a terrible impact on society - to the point that Enigma might never have been broken and the Allies could have lost the war. I think it's the same thing with guns. I have nothing against guns themselves or people owning them, or people printing them, as long as it's not a general detriment to society. I just don't think the timing is right. It's not the (hopefully) intelligent people like you I'm worried about...

How did you model the difficulty? Also, a useful way of understanding / performing the analysis is to run two estimates: one where you conservatively estimate everything (low avg hash for everyone, high difficulty, late BFL delivery, etc), and one where you liberally estimate everything (high avg hash est, lower difficulty, sooner BFL delivery).
