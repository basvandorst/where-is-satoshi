Go on...
@_date: 2018-09-19 03:12:53
Yup, and all it takes is a handful of the many panic sellers out there to get wind of these Shit Reports.
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:20:42
Yes, an article with a Title like that can definitely cause a crash and panic...   
The Mt Gox claim actions themselves, I dont know, probably not a severe crash on its own.  
But I hear there are a handful of panic sellers in the crypto game...

Dude I'll grab a cookie
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:13:54
There definitely is Mt Gox FUD going around right now.  Several articles claiming "1 $billion dollars worth of BTC to FLOOD market courtesy of Mt Gox" - to "cause the largest crash in history".   
Thems fightin' (FUD'n) words

Yup, wait for it
@_date: 2019-10-05 12:46:35
Very existential
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:08:03
BTC might not be but blockchain sure as hell will be adopted.  It is happening right now.  
@_date: 2019-02-19 01:05:44
Yeah sorry guys this # is probably even high.  I don’t remember where I read this.  Either way if it’s lower it drives my point home even more.  Not many people got BTC to $20k.  
I think I meant &lt; 1%
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:58:44
Think about how beautiful the charts will be propped up on that stand...
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:36:46
Always the same kind of negativity
@_date: 2019-02-23 00:50:53
MASS ADOPTION
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:41:02
And adding more complexity, what happens when ppl die? With their keys, lost forever?
That is where Safe Haven comes in.
-shit sorry I just shilled didn’t I? It’s important tho
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:08:22
Pretty much 
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:23:46
What was it, about 1% of the world was invested in crypto @ $20k.  U sure u don’t want to retract these statements?
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:03:58
Are you trying to tell me that...  Bitcoin is...  Dead...?
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:18:00
Well I’m not going to buy all floppy
@_date: 2019-12-17 13:51:43
2020 will solve all my problems
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:34:02
Did you do a lot of research on BTC ATMs?  Is this  a good brand / company?
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:16:04
Almost the key word
@_date: 2019-05-04 06:21:04
You have had almost 1.5 years dude...  it’s time for bull
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:47:28
Like a crypto farm?  A farm network of nodes of some kind?  Like a farm of Storj nodes?  Or literally a good old fashioned countryside farm? With cattle and chickens and corns and shits?

GrocerChain. GCX.  Ico soon

This doesn’t sound like Binance’s support at all.  I had a request to retrieve only like $250 worth of tokens deposited to a wrong coin address (yeah the dummy mistake).
Support sent me a list of everything they required from me.  Transactions proving , addresses to &amp; from etc.
I was pissed off that they said they needed to charge 0.2 ETH to process the reversal. I bitched &amp; complained about them making plenty of $ already &amp; no need to charge me, other exchanges don’t charge for service requests, etc...   they never gave in, but at the end they never took the 0.2 ETH from me!
So even at the time I hated their service just like “1200 BTC Stored on a Foreign Centralized Exchange Guy” does.  But it turns out, their service was EXCELLENT &amp; doesn’t sound anything like he is saying.   UNLESS there is a reason, etc etc like he did something shady, under investigation etc...
This got long...  oh well
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:07:26
Then again this is A LOT of money, it is not up to Binance what happens with this $ &amp; should be returned.  Idk...   lunch break over lol
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:47:29
Thought so. Thanks

Dumb-arsed-noob question.  Does this get you coins in any way? Any financial benefit?  Benefits other than being awesome &amp; helping the network by running a full node &amp; doing your crypto duty?
