Pure intellectual dishonesty. Quality of life has been improving since the industrial revolution. Money printing has absolutely nothing to do with that. The reason quality of life improved is advancements in technology and medicine, coupled with productivity gains. 
Your logic is completely inverse of what actually happens: Inflation mainly benefits the rich. The poor are the ones who lose most from inflation, for a simple macro-economic reason: They’re the ones who get to spend the money last. When money is created in the financial system, it is issued by the treasury by the means of bonds, which are mainly bought by banks. The banks lend that money to companies, who spend it in the real economy, by buying capital goods and making investments. The money trickles down the economic chain, raising prices all the way until it gets to employees. And since no one gets their wage adjusted on a daily or even monthly basis, anyone with a fixed income will lose out on purchasing power, effectively transferring their wealth to government and banks.

You’re just spouting conspiracy theories. More capital= more liquidity, which means more investment, simple as that.

i’ve just sent $1,000 worth of bitcoin with a 1.50 tx fee, how long can it take to confirm? Does it get cancelled at one one point if there are no confirmations?
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:05:15
If you want to day trade there are many other assets out there with more liquidity, why would you day trade bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:46:57
“Trading style”
Lol, trading low-volume assets like most shitcoins is pure gambling. One whale decides to sell and you’re done. Of course it was easy to make money with alts when they were all booming in these last few months. But that’s not trading, it’s just a general pump. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:06:30
Which coins? As of now there aren’t any other coins that solves bitcoins problems. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:08:42
Absolutely not. If you want money that can be printed unlimitedly there is fiat out there already.

Taxation has been increasing throughout the years, and yet inequality keeps rising. What is your evidence that taxation is so good it’s not up to discussion? Who cares if you studied economics for 6 years, the people in central banks studied much more than you and look at the shit they do all the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:20:47
Interesting that inequality is rising every year... and yet the system is working so fine it’s not even up to discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:18:10


does income there get to be adjusted every month?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:03:07
So how did the economy exist back in the times of the gold standard when money couldn’t be printed? Inflation is a tax, just as any other, if you think having 3% of your money stolen every year is healthy, then good for you. I’d rather keep my money. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:08:25


I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. If you increase demand artificially, by the means of printing money, you’re going to create mass inflation and debt, which will cause a downturn in the growth of economy later. No sustainable growth comes by the means of money printing. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:11:18
Do people get their salaries readjusted every month? 
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:06:22
and whats wrong with the gold standard? Poor government wont be be able to print trillions of dollars anymore? 
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:21:50
do you really understand how the gold standard works? Its basically when the currency's value is based on a fixed amount of gold. This amount can be extremely low, or almost meaningless, so the monetary base can be large enough to supply the demands for money. What it doesnt allow is unresponsible money printing, which generates inflation and reduces poor people's purchasing power.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:16:10
What if the government locks your account? What if you get chargeback scammed? With your money in a bank you're at the governments mercy. You don't really own that money.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:06:12
We’re not in the 19th century anymore bro. Marxism has failed.  Value is subjective, if bitcoin is seen as a valuable asset by people and they willingly give their wealth to bitcoin owners, then everyone wins. No one is getting poorer because other people got rich. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:19:45
People who get mad about it are even dumber. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:13:43
Please explain me how the poorer get poorer? Do rich people steal money from someone? Last time I checked most of them get rich by selling things to poor people, which means the poor voluntarily gave their money to them.  Don’t see how anyone is getting poorer here.
And by your logic the US, Switzerland, Monaco, etc. should be third world countries and Africa should be a developed continent, since the evil rich are all located in those places and and barely any live in Africa. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:08:52
What’s the problem with the other people getting richer? Does that make you any poorer? If someone voluntarily gives their wealth to some other person in exchange for bitcoins, how does that affect your life?
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:33:41
The economy is not a zero sum game. It’s not like a casino where in order for someone to win, someone has to lose. In voluntary transactions in the economy, both parties win. 
Take Jeff Bezos for example, richest man in the world. He earned most of his fortune by selling extremely cheap goods on the internet. His company made life more affordable for millions of families, especially middle and low class. At the same time he employs millions of people, mostly high-income tech jobs, which helps push up salaries across the entire workforce. 
He didn’t make anyone poorer, in fact, his fortune is a reward for being successful in the market, which means he provided a service that proved itself to be extremely beneficial and in high demand.

If you're okay with the government and third parties controlling your money then why are you wasting your time in the bitcoin subreddit? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:11:58


They tried to ban machines when the industrial revolution happened too. History punishes those who stay on the wrong side of it. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:29:47
It’s amazing how many Fiat/Central Bank experts and supporters are here. Wonder why they’re wasting their time in the bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:23:03
we need a user friendly company. and Im talking about 60-year old user friendly
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:23:37
well, did those dollars increase 30,000% in value over that time? Its different.
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:38:52
Have you heard the sound of a V10 engine? Who cares about destroying the world, I’ll be dead before anything serious happens anyway
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:02:24
These said "economists" are just a bunch of close-minded that learned a lot of keysenian crap at college and think they know the absolute truth. If you ask them to spell "economy" without "state" their minds explode. Thay cant conceive how humans can peacefully trade without the good guy government telling them how and what to buy and sell. I'm not saying bitcoin is perfect, just that their reaction in r/economics was so cliché and expected.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:08:07
but there arent 21 million BTC out there, only 12~13 and will take some real time until we reach that cap.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:37:22
Yes, what about a 500,000 inhabitants town in Brazil?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:41:39
the thing is the site im using cut out all transaction fees for this weekend, so people are trading like crazy and the price has been fluctuating a lot. But Im definitely get an old pen drive and backup my coins
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:07:18
for me, the backup/storage thing was the worst part. everyone says its dangerous to store in online wallets, and storing locally without backup is dangerous, but its complicated to it, and the explanations of how to do it are too complicated.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:02:04
if bitcoin rises its value to 1 million in 5 years, what will you do with all the money?
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:37:51
you have to consider the context when doing a price speculation. If bitcoin gets to $10k, it will be huge. Just look at recent coinbase wallet creation numbers. By that time, more than 10000 people will be getting into bitcoin every day. if they all buy an average of 500 $, in 20 days youll pay one of these guys, if you dont count people that already have btc and are putting more cash into it. Thats not much, if you think about china, europe, americas, everyone hearing about it on the news and getting interested in a safe, profitable investment, set aside getting rid of banks and taxes.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:36:30
thats what im into. I dont think it will go below 900. When the banks open tomorrow and more people start buying it should level off
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:46:39
COMMENTING TO REMIND LATER.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:39:46
more than a bank in some ways, and less in others.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:46:31
one thing I dont get is why there is a tax for sending BTC in multibit. Where does that tax go?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:34:15
with all the money he got from us today, he'll have at least 50000
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:21:51
i did my first purchase on gyft yesterday and boy is that the future. in 15 seconds after sending the coins i already had the code. keep up with the great job.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:09:36
thats what I fucking did!
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:07:09
passphrase=password? in order to backup I just need to copy/paste the .wallet files?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:27:49
i use multibit. I am currently storing most of my BTCs in the online market I bought them, just a small fraction are in the wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:21:23
the thing is, the market is too fragile. if he spends 1% of his fortune, major crashes will happen. We need a bigger capitalization and a higher money flow so he can start doing whatever he wants to do.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:35:41
yes. buy amazon.com credits at gyft, you know, there is always something you need at amazon.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:13:14
he also doesnt necessarily have 150k. you are talking like he is going to sell it all now. he can take 10k, have some fun, and let the rest there, he'll probably have a million in an year or two.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:21:08
but he isnt investing 140k of his hard-earned money, the investment was 1.5k an year ago. Its a question of ambiciousness. He can turn himself into a millionaire and live comfortably for the rest of his life, or take the money now and maybe buy half a shitty apartment or a nice car.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:46:17
well, im sick of my house and Id love to live in an apartment. Want to trade?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:57:53
What we really need is a "google" or "apple" for bitcoin. A full suite of services related to the currency. From trade to online and even offline wallet. A friendly user interface, a wide array of payment methods, foruns, mobile apps, business friendly services. Its still too complicated for the average guy to get into the thing, either he wants to buy or accept BTC.
