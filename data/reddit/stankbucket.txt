IOW, don't be online

That was my exact progression as well. The Note3 was built for me. I grabbed an iPhone4 the other day and it felt like I was playing with OP's penis.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:34:16
That is their one perk since they can have things like heroin and fully automatic weapons.

Yes Zuckerberg would be so fucked if they gave him billions and billions to take his company

I get it with any of the iOS stuff, but I switched to MacBookPros as my goto dev box years ago and I have never regretted it. There is nothing walling me in.
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:06:00
No, not nearly every person. Many people have more than one.
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:54:45
But you're not an investor if it is converted automatically for you.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:17:43


Yes. It takes just as much time. Then it takes some more time. Paying for small transactions with a card is generally faster than paying with cash.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:18:57
It looks like a total scam, but I love the idea. Why hasn't somebody done this? You can even have a different kind of lotto where there is always a winner and they get whatever is in the current pot (minus fees).

You already can send most of your messages via Facebook if you want.

Can't get 2-day and overnight as PO boxes. Also, a lot of shippers won't ship to PO boxes because it's usually somebody trying to shield his identity.

Funny thing: the game has more users than all of the people who have ever graduated from an Ivy League college.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:08:57
No, it would suck. If the value dropped by half you would see 1/2 the value in it and would either need twice as much or would get half as much satisfaction from it. I want the value to double and the cost to half.

Yeah, the president of TCP/IP is just a figurehead. The assistant to the regional manager of TCP/IP runs the show.

I was going off of the first mention of 7B which was about devices. The second 7B is not real since not everybody has a phone.
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:20:08
But it's nice to have customers
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:07:39
It pretty much is.

One is probably trusted by an unknowing consumer. The other looks like a place to get a tattoo.
@_date: 2016-02-03 12:24:42
Sounds like they're 1/3 of the way there.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:36:53
2000 in fact. The operative word is estimate which usually means round numbers.
@_date: 2012-09-02 16:11:13
And for precisely this reason the people should be revolting
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:25:43
Like the health care bill that was so long that nobody read it?
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:37:14
I assume it's just an ad and you can't actually pay with BTC.
@_date: 2015-09-30 12:50:03
Spotify is nice and all, but you don't get the full catalog and you never will from a service that wants to license everything because there are always some content providers who withhold their stuff.
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:37:16
Eventually the solution is to just drop off of the grid.
@_date: 2015-09-30 12:51:59
The stripe of bittorrent?
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:00:45
Yes. You have a small chance if you can buy your own firmware, but even then if you're not VPN-ing everything it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:25:46
I trust my VPN far more than I trust my ISP. Don't trust any service you're getting for free unless it's through a buddy or through a scattered mesh.
@_date: 2015-11-27 21:51:31
First, it was obviously a joke. Second, you can run it through 100 routers and that's only going to add the opportunities to sniff what you are doing unless you are encrypting before the first compromised device.
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:26:39
They do, but they encode NSA as UL.

My ass doesn't have a link so I can't post it.

You'll get better ping times with a carrier pigeon transporting stone tablets.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:22:37
Like punching someone in the dark.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:22:07
I have no problem paying the creator for movies/TV/music. The problem is that the vast majority of what you pay goes to a series of middle men that provide zero service when the content is available online.
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:49:39
I like Clef, but there are just no sites that I use (and I use a lot) using it.
@_date: 2015-11-28 04:34:11
PIA and another that I get through my usenet provider.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:52:32
I don't disagree. The problem is that the system and protections around that make the product cost 10x or more and the consumer pays it and the creator gets a pittance.
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:36:56
If somebody is giving you VPN for free and they're not at least getting the occasional handy from you, you can't trust what they're doing with your data.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:20:48
And who wrote that law?
"Lawlessness is the condition in which your adversary refers you to a law he made."
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:52:58
That is laughable.
@_date: 2015-10-08 02:09:02
But in any crypto service I use I don't want the provider to be able to reset my password.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:17:55
It's a model that works.
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:50:09
Have we got a video?
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:37:54
If that's what the majority of the submissions are then maybe the majority of the community is children.

Google is a search company. They can't search your email for you (or for themselves) if they can't read it.
@_date: 2015-10-08 11:49:32
Absolutely. If I give any control to somebody else then I am giving them the option of 100%. Then, to add insult to injury, they charge you for the use of their security hole.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:51:13
Those places are about much more than a movie. That's why they charge more and people pay it.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:18:32
Expiration date is not always enforced.  When we used to do recurring charges for memberships my code just added two years to the expiration date until the date was in the future and it would not complain. When I say used to I am taking about code that is still running.
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:41:38
You can post those things. You just might be liable for damages.
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:48:53
It's a pin, not a dove.
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:12:09
And if you add in the cost of power it will likely be much less attractive.

If you don't already have a CC there's no reason for you to transact with CC vs bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:43:26
That's like saying I made $50K in bitcoin because I decided not to buy at the high.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:27:22
Let us know when they post on their site that it's actually in their plans. Until then it's an empty promise.
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:34:46
Are they not totally diluting the value of these advertising sites? Clearly they are not buying any of the stuff advertised and are just gaming the system.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:24:21
It's used as a verb and that is their whole goal - to become like google, xerox and kleenex.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:39:02
That's what the up arrow thingie is for
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:02:56
Yes. He's probably paying something per transaction which makes very small transactions unprofitable for him. He should be able to just pass the fee on to the customer as long as the customer is OK with it.
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:01:41
So I guess is going to become a spam board for people selling things that accept bitcoin
