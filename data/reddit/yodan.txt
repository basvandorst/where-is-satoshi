When I set up my ledger I opened a new wallet using it's software as brand new.  I paid a fee and sent my bitcoin over from my old wallet.  Now I want to access the new coins that I'm not allowed to name.  I am wondering if I can somehow use the recovery seed from the old wallet to access the coins or if I need to use a 3rd party wallet to then send over to the ledger with normal fees.

Okay so say you are a bank and get to print money and create debt from nothing as you see fit to control your business.  Why would you want to use an immutable public ledger outside of your own influence?  The banks would much rather have their own private bookkeeping than have competitors or skeptics be able to view all transactions or uncover dirty secrets.

Hmm I see why that is annoying but unless you are trying to sell before the 5 days, would it matter all that much?  If you day trade this makes it impossible to buy/sell dips but for the average joe who wants X amount usd--&gt;btc its not so bad for getting fiat to btc. My only btc purchase was done this way a number of months back using coinbase actually.  Sorry it isn't working out for you.

People just need to know it is an option, I agree that any full dump into one spot is a bad idea.  If my currency was collapsing, I'd probably throw at least 1/3 of my net into btc or another global bank note just to have liquidity when it's needed.  Greece needs CASH right now on the streets, no question, but it's always good to have breathing room online/overseas. It's something that would make sense doing a month or two before a rough day than when scrambling and banks closing your access to everything.
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:30:56

If it means having liquidity amidst closed bank accounts and devaluing currency (future price unknown but not looking good at all) it's worth throwing a good chunk of change at bitcoin.  Even if you don't use the bitcoin you can convert it back to any currency once the shit times die down.

"The more people invest, the more motivated they become to ensure that it doesn't fail"
That's a ponzi scheme and they happen all the time and do shut down.  I don't believe bitcoin is one because it is the blockchain tech and has legitimate digital uses.  It could fail overnight if a better method of secure transfer and limited creation comes around...call it Bettercoin or something, ya?  If a team of people end up creating fiber optic speed transfers vs dial up wouldn't it make sense that dial up bites the dust?  The way I see bitcoin is that its good until something is better.  I agree that the infrastructure is definitely behind bitcoin vs other similar technologies and is heavily rooted already, it will take a massive blow to be hurt.  As long as bitcoin remains adaptable it will live on and possibly take over remittance and other banking in the future...but then again someone could make a Bettercoin and surpass the capabilities of bitcoin in the future too.  I believe in bitcoin and moreso the blockchain, but I am not about to stand in the way of innovation if it comes along.  And yes...if someone does find an exploit that is baked into the entire system, it could immediately come crashing down.  Imagine someone figuring out how to drain a wallet, boom there goes EVERYONES wallet.  
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:11:34
Don't time a market, if you believe that long term it will increase then today's price doesn't matter. If you try to day trade you will get burned. Do what I did, buy some and sit on it for years and don't touch. It will either go up and you'll be happy or go down and that money 2 or 3 years ago won't be missed. Just gamble with that you are willing to lose, this is not an investment it is a speculative market.  Any new technologies are not guaranteed success, but sometimes they do succeed.

What's to stop the owner (or anyone else) from creating a bunch of addresses, send a bid at 1btc, and then 29 bids at .01 a few days later to flood out a win?  As long as you push your first bid to the top you'll make out with at least an extra .01 coin.  It's first come first serve from what they are explaining on their sites.

People are split on how to continue the blockchain now that the amount of users and transactions are growing to a tipping point for scaling speeds+power.  Bitcoin needs a majority of miners to have the same systems in place so the blockchain reflects the info.  If for example everyone decided to beef up the blockchain in 3 different ways, there would be a 33% split between the miners and it wouldnt work...so theres a debate on which kind of expansion is needed and no one is agreeing yet.  In a nutshell from what I've been reading.  If there is a decided replacement of code that 51% or more of the miners adopt then scaling will solve this congestion it's having.

USA.  I've read over the sidebar and faq's, but setting up the thing as a whole seems daunting.  I know I need to create a wallet to use my phone as my bitcoin bank, and to use an exchange service for buying/selling that takes a few days to clear.  But I'm inexperienced with choosing reliable services since the actual coding aspect is foreign to me. Ideally I'm looking to be able to transfer money between my bank(usd) and my wallet(btc) at will.  And since it takes a few days to clear, will the sell price be at the moment you click or at the moment it clears (days later)?  Thanks if that was a mouthful. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:22:32
Considering btc was worth pennies and is now a thousand bucks... Don't worry about it. Until it crashes back to pennies it hasn't lost any initial value.

Please don't throw most of your money out into a speculative market.  It isn't an investment, it is a speculative gamble.  Anything this new and untested could either become huge or totally fail within a few years.  Throw a small % of your worth at it, like 3 or 5% but don't use your cash like that on a larger scale.  If you suddenly had a 100k a year job you really wouldn't want 70k of it to fluctuate each day/month, you'd want it accessible to pay bills and for food  without worrying about "ok ill wait a month and i might be back on top!".   
Basically just use some fun money or something that you wouldn't be heartbroken over if its gone overnight.  Bitcoin is so new and changes so often that news basically dictates its price to some level at this stage of the game.  If you want to throw a hundred bucks at it, go for it, but if I were you I'd keep most of your money liquid right now as you'll need it for college and beyond.  When you have more/earn more, you can spend more without feeling the hurt of needing it immediately.  A vanguard spread of stocks would be a wiser financial investment long term than throwing all your money at btc and hoping it won't get out-done years from now or literally anything that hurts its value.  The potential is there but its not an investment, its speculation.

If you want to cash in, sell until you recoup your original buy and then whatever you have left keep for profit.  If you can find products to buy in btc then just do that instead to leverage your dollar/btc value.  Imagine you bought at 200, your 200 is now worth 700 if you went to spend on things like gift cards or products.  Otherwise cashing out to FIAT/your bank is an option but remember taxes in April, counts as income for profit i believe once it touches your bank acct.  
@_date: 2016-06-20 00:40:59
Would you rather keep your money at home/in your pocket or online with a company?  Thats the difference.  If coinbase decided to file bankruptcy tomorrow and close shop or they get hacked or flag your account for any reason they have your money.  Their cold storage vs your cold storage should be identical in essence, so it just depends on where you want your coins to be at any given moment.  
@_date: 2016-06-02 03:38:53
It IS the banks, once you're using bitcoin for bitcoin transactions you are good on fees and speed.  Moving between FIAT currencies and bitcoin will have to go through regulated exchanges, banks, etc, that all take a fee for themselves and are loaded with bureaucracy.  If you wanted to send 10 bitcoins to another bitcoin wallet or buy something with your 10 bitcoins it would be fast and low fee.  Its the converting it part that you're seeing fees and slow down with.  Same thing when you're traveling to europe from america and withdraw local euros, there is a bank conversion fee.

Yes you are missing the part where you are buying and selling via exchanges. Bitcoin to bitcoin is VERY cheap when moving around. What you are directly complaining about is the % an exchange company takes to convert fiat to btc back to fiat which is dumb. The idea is using btc without changing it back and forth with a 3rd party. It will cost you cents to send thousands of dollars in btc to another btc wallet. If I buy a product online with btc then it is cheaper than wiring money. If you are converting it after that then you need to pay the exchange their fee. Don't flip flop. 
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:11:11

Banks are naturally middlemen and hold YOUR money in THEIR building.  You need to go through them, with fees, to access what you already own.  In theory it's good for both parties as one gets paid to secure your funds from theft and fraud, they can even help find the thieves who steal from you.  In reality, while that's true, they also hurt poorer customers and charge bogus fees to 95% of their clients.  Is it worth the protection/services?  Maybe maybe not, but bitcoin allows you to avoid all that and have the option of "my money is in account 1, and I can send it to account 2 in a few minutes" instead of waiting days and fees for overseas transfers.  That's it in a nutshell.  Sort of.

It's super easy to open 10 fake stores using stolen product photos and just wait for your first customer.  Then close shop and do it again.

Escrow would actually solve the chargeback problem to some degree but wouldn't that eventually cause the need for an "optional bank" of sorts that all service payments must go through to ensure being able to get your money back?  As in ebay/etsy/amazon/etc would all need to use this to ensure customers dont get ripped off.

Depends, why don't you do the math on your average buy price by adding up all of your btc purchases and dividing by the total number of purchases?  Use your average btc price compared to todays btc price.  Then see what that is worth % wise compared to right now if you decided to cash out.  What would your magic # need to be to cash out above what a 401k would have given you for the same total $ you put into bitcoin so far?  That's for you to find out, not us, however it is useful information for future buyers including yourself if the answer is favorable.

bitcoins are the info that the chain uses to send other info on top of, think of it like blood cells in a vein.  It is expensive to keep the data and electricity flowing so the blockchain blood becomes valuable in order to stay alive.  A private blockchain/sidechain wouldn't need a global investment for something like private bookkeeping or other ledger tech but this is the biggest public one and has the most to offer due to it's global reach/size.  You can layer other things on top of this system so its incentivized to use the big one.  I think that sums it up but if anyone has a correction, please post below.

I'll copy/paste what I wrote a while back in another thread.  This was a response to someone who tried giving their waiter BTC instead of paper money.  It's not meant to be mean, just some perspective outside of the box.  I know you want to spread the word about a good product but doing it like that isn't the thing that will convince people.
"He is saying that it's the equivalent of someone giving you Euros instead of dollars if you work in New York City as a tip. You'd have to go to the bank and convert it and shit before it's worth anything to you. Reading about bitcoin and making a wallet and storing it on your phone or computer at home is way more intrusive to someone who doesn't know about it. You're forcing someone to use your standards instead of just tipping them in the local currency. It's rude to impose YOUR wallet system on someone else who doesn't use it yet. It's different if they know about it already and you then ask to use BTC for tipping. Servers want to go home and sleep after a shift, not spend a day figuring out how to get 20 bucks in bitcoin into their bank account. People will use bitcoin when it's convenient for them and not convenient for YOU."

coinbase or circle or another reliable exchange I'd say, but you will need to pay taxes on them in most places at that time of the year if its a substantial amount.  Anything you "earned" from price jumps counts as income I believe so if you bought at 200 lets say and sold at 500, you'd pay taxes on the 300 earned in April.  Dont try to cash out 5 grand in BTC and think the bank wont notice, it will bite you in the ass down the line. Please do research into these options too and taxes, I'm definitely no expert but I wouldnt doubt that a pile of internet funny money would make a bank or the IRS suspicious of where it came from without their fair share of taxes.  
@_date: 2016-05-31 03:41:13
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin, but depending on your currency used to purchase it and what price it was at the time, you have more or less purchasing power now with FIAT prices.  Example, if you bought when bitcoin was at 100 dollars each, your 100 dollars is now worth 500 dollars in purchasing power.  If you bought when it was at 1000, your purchasing power now is half that, since its worth 500.

No. Mycelium and a few others give you a list of 12 or 24 words to write down on paper and store in the event that your HD wallet (an account that stores multiple addresses) needs to be restored.  Typing in those exact phrases will re-populate your accounts on a fresh Mycelium (or other app) install.  It isn't a private key but it will restore your lost ones in that wallet.

@_date: 2015-02-09 15:07:10
Thanks!  Quick question about generating the addresses on an unplugged computer though, how will the blockchain recognize an offline, never used address if they're created in a vacuum?  I'd imagine that to send funds to the paper wallet that it would need to be recognized by the network.  I'll find a live boot CD to make a few wallets anyway in the meantime.  Also, is it safer to totally wipe a paper wallet once I decide to use the funds (send to myclium for example) and just send the remainder over to a new paper wallet until next time (I'm assuming this would make it hard for people to steal)?  You've been helpful.

Well he's saying that if you write down your address and private key, no matter which program you use in the future you can retrieve your coins.  Losing your phone would only lose your funds if you didn't backup your mnemonic phrases from the program and had no idea what your wallet seed was.  
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:51:44
Great, thank you!  I guess I need fresh installs to generate new HD seeds.  Would you recommend using an old phone with mycelium on it as an offline wallet generator?  If you've happened to have read my thread from yesterday I'm having trouble securing a paper wallet and would love to use dedicated hardware to do this when needed (my mac has no cd drive for liveboot paper wallets).  I've no problem deleting the account once I write it down.  Ideally I can create and discard accounts as needed.
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:02:56
It's only insecure if you lost your phone the same way its insecure to lose a credit/debit card.  As long as you have your wallet seed and private key written down, you can reclaim your lost BTC even if your phone is gone forever.  I agree that current infrastructure is safer for losing a debit card since a bank can close it and reverse transactions, but the tradeoff of NOT having that is the absence of fees for handling your money.  Bitcoins are currently a trade-off between security and convenience which has to change for genuine mass adoption.  Basically, be your own bank and avoid fees on moving and storing your money or use normal cards but accept ATM fees, wire transfer fees, low balance fees, etc.  She didn't know the risks and took a plunge but that doesnt mean everyone does that.

No, the argument is that until bitcoin can be used fluidly in daily walks of life that it's not ready to be gifted at random.  Cash for a birthday gift is infinitely more flexible than bitcoin as a gift in the current state of things.  You could buy the gift with bitcoin, sure, but for the birthday boy it would make things more complex than necessary.  If you're going to use the argument that bitcoin is as good as gold, try walking into a pawn shop with bitcoin looking for quick liquidity.  Betcha can't cash it out like a bad gift, right?

@_date: 2015-02-16 21:46:20
My question too, trezor/ledger look like stand-alone versions of the Mycelium app along with its seed backup.  Is the selling point that it isn't on a phone and is insulated from malware via no internet connection?  I simply don't see why this is better than using paper wallets for storage and mycelium for hot wallets.  Keep 1000's on the paper wallet and 50-100 bucks on mycelium for spending.  Someone convince me.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:12:06
Thanks for the pdf info.  For the wallets I mean that I see where I can add extra HD wallets to mycelium but is there a way to choose which get backed up when I one day decide to restore via seed phrases?  I'm thinking a few accounts at time and not ALL HD wallets on mycelium at once with the seed I wrote down.
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:19:05
Would creating multiple wallets on a mycelium hd account and transferring between those a few times work?
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:27:16
you can just look at the blockchain to see each transaction, there arent names associated with them but if coinbase sells a customer a bitcoin, they can trace all transaction from that number to another wallet.  if your wallets are flagged as "instert store here" to them, all transactions that link back to the coins they sold can be seen as one of their customers buying legal herbal supplements.  blockchain is 100% transparent which is its strength vs other financial mediums.  basically they keep backtracking coins until it leads to their own coins that they sold, so if a customer is breaking their terms of service by swapping them around wallets until they buy something considered shady they wont hesitate to block that customer since it would be violating their TOS.

Alright, so printing lets say, 10 paper wallets and using 1 at a time as needed should be okay then.  I guess I was concerned that 2 offline wallets could potentially have the same address and didn't want to send money into limbo.  
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:14:27

Thank you. Where can I view the private keys on each wallet? Or is the HD account the only one I can see after backing it up?

So, what's to stop you from picking someone who will steal your package and open a new wallet for themselves on Mycelium or something?
