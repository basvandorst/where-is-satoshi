Ethereum transaction volume overtook Bitcoins a long while back. At its peek, it still only cost a fraction of a dollar to send a transaction, which arrived in minutes, not hours or days. So I don't understand where this scaling is far worse comes from.

They are only a small company. They probably have been swamped with consumer enquires with the recent headlines, and can't cope with the demand.
Looks like they just want to deal with larger clientele, which is a pity.

Don't worry. Kraken are trustworthy. They found my money, when I made a mistake.
Like all other exchanges, they have been unable to cope with the exponential growth of cryptos. Hiring and training new people to clear the support backlog takes time.

My guess is, they are too small to deal with the consumer market. With the recent publicity, they must be inundated with new users, wanting to deposit small amounts of money.

DAI is a collateralized smart contact token on Ethereum pegged to USD.
PegNet is non-collateralized platform with (as of today) 14 crypto, 14 fiat, and two commodities (Gold &amp; Silver) tokens. Miners act as oracles to set the prices.  No slippage, and $0.001 conversion fees.

Good to see Tim Draper there being bullish on Bitcoin.  I wonder what he thinks of PegNet, which is a side project from one of his investments. If you haven't looked at it, its a stablecoin platform, that anchors to Bitcoin, and has cpu oracle mining. Totally decentralised and non-sovereign like Bitcoin.

Did you buy because you believe in the technology?  Did you check out the competition? Or did you buy into the hype. If it was the latter, you should think about your next move before its too late.

Your assuming Bitcoin will swing back up. You don't know that. That's how bag holders are made.

If you use any business Accounts software in the UK, make sure it supports BTC as a currency.  I asked KashFlow, and they added it a few days later!
