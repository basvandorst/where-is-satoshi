You know what would be great?  
A website like gonewild where people could leave tips in bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-10-16 23:28:33
Where do you buy these from?
@_date: 2013-08-31 02:44:56
I want more services like this in Canada.

Let me know if you need a guinea pig for Canadian transactions.

He completely misunderstood the tide thing.
@_date: 2013-02-21 08:58:12
Yup I totally agree with you there. But if you are sure that bitcoins will go down then selling now is obviously the right move.
@_date: 2013-07-25 16:33:05
Because the margins for retailers are so small on Tide, many small stores are willing to buy unused second hand tide at 50-75% of sticker price.  
For this reason some drug dealers have started accepting stolen Tide as payment.  
The strength of Tide as a currency lies in the fact that it can be easily exchanged for USD. Not in any kind of brand loyalty.

What kind of rules?
@_date: 2013-08-28 00:37:45
Do you ship to Canada?

It seems like there is a pretty widespread bitcoin related DDOS going on right now.  
BTCGuild, BFL, Bitmit are also all down right now.

If you don't pay for power you can make about $6 per month at current rates. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:13:40
Well assuming again that you don't pay for power you would make around $20 per month.  
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:24:00
Agreed, they are a solid choice.

Since virtex doesn't have an average weight, do you base it on last sale price?  
If so this lends itself to some manipulation. For example right now the last price is $99.00. However if I bought 3.4027 btc right now I could bring that last sale price up to $104.50. If I were planning on making a big trade with you guys that would make a pretty big difference.

Sell your bitcoins. Rebuy when it goes down.

How about Canada? Does anyone know of a service like this that works in Canada?
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:22:42
Sounds great, I've been looking to do this for a while.  
Will you be limited to this list of companies or will you be adding more in the near future?  
I'd love to see more western Canadian companies on there.
@_date: 2013-07-25 17:35:43
Yeah its true, at its root it goes back to the strength of Tide as a consumer brand.  
However he made it seem like the drug dealers/users have some sort of subconscious trust in the brand that makes them use it as a currency.  
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:10:33
You are much better off to actually buy some bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-12 20:35:38
Please start shipping to Canada. I will buy all the things.
