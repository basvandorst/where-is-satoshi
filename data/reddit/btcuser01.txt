he won't help me either :(

I did go to her. She ended up getting me my coins, but at the cost of my individual privacy and wallet anonymity. You can see my updated post for more info on specifics.

Thank you for the explanation of why it only happened this time and not on my test transaction. Still doesn't help my situation, though. And I think they should have included it in their statements to me when I asked.

I saw you were about to help other people with their WOC issues, can you help me please?

I just got the coins but had to compromise my individual privacy and wallet anonymity to do so. See the update in the original post for more info.

Hmm, never got that email from you. I got the coins but had to compromise my individual privacy and wallet anonymity to do so. See the update in the original post for more info.

Not yet, but progress has been made thanks to you. I still don't have my coins, but I'll post back here once the issue is fully resolved.

yeah, that's all I can think of too. It looks like my only option is to do what they say and then get a new wallet. :-(
I hope no one else ends up in this position. It sucks.

You're awesome, thanks for doing what you can. I'll keep working at them.

Now that my transaction is fully completed, could you please delete my personal information and ID pictures from your system?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:32:35
Thank you for reaching out, Sarah, and thank you for assisting me on the phone. I hope the transaction/issue can be resolved soon. I'll keep you posted!

Hey Sarah, you were helpful. I still have not gotten my coins, but I'll keep an eye out and post back here once I get them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:51
No worries. I know y'all are super busy all the time. That's why I never got any of the emails or callbacks I was told I'd get from the compliance officer.

I did google that before using them, but I saw all positive things. Even the issues I saw posted had gotten resolved by the end of the thread. I didn't see anyone mentioning things like this.
