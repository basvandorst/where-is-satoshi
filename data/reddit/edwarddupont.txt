The turn will happen when the people on this sub diminish and when the word moon will be replaced with hodl. Just think about this sub when bitcoin was near 3k not too long ago. 
Right now isn't when parabolic moves happen. Right now is when a trading range is formed and accumulation ensues by long term holders and believers.  [

It was never designed to "benefit" the middle class by making people rich. That's not how an economy works; that's not how you develop a middle class. You develop a middle class by lending money for economic expansion and growth by means of a government or federal reserve in this case.
The gold standard would only allow the government to print out "x" amount of dollars per ounce of gold, therefore your economy was based off of how much gold you could mine that day/week/year.
You're economy can't be based off of a gold standard if you want growth. Sure you can have one and never grow, never have a bubble, and keep people and governments in check, but the ends justify the means in this case, ie bubbles in the markets are based off of lending and debt which allows for people to build houses, companies, etc.
The example Ray Dalio gives is






This is why debt is good regardless of whether it can be paid or not. It allows for infrastructure improvements, it allows for growth.

Weakening your own currency makes debt cheaper. Cheaper debt typically is serviceable and more debt can be taken on.
Fed cuts rates = cheaper money(more printing/quantitative easing) = more debt = expansion, rinse and repeat until the bubble pops
Fed increases rates = expensive money (less printing)/quantitative tightening) = less debt = less expansion, economy slows or the bubble pops earlier and is easily dealt with - see dot com bubble. Interest rates were at like 6% and was able to be lowered with so much dry powder. The economy was able to bounce back relatively quickly unlike 08'

Like you said, "He's smart". Schiff is a fraud and loves selling to gold bugs who believe the end of the world is right around the corner at all times. He sells to your emotions and does a pretty good job at it. At the end of the day he makes money regardless of what precious metals do.

Gold may not be a great investment to some of you, but there are some great gold miners out there.
Gold just broke out of a 6 year trading range and is currently 1420/oz. The continued rate cuts will boost not only the stock market but also precious metals because of money printing and devaluing the USD which in turn we should see bitcoin and alts soar to new all time highs.
I'm not against bitcoin by any means, but don't think for a second you can't make a lot of money in PMs.

I'd guess 10 years. My thoughts are the next recession will bring rates close to zero and as we get out of a recession, the fed will raise rates like usual. Automation at this point will be fairly rampant and job growth will be dwindling along with housing data. The fed will have no choice but to leave rates close to zero and eventually negative. The stock market will eventually experience a depression like scenario where all stocks go down 80% plus. The USD will be deemed worthless with a bad economy and the selloff and panic will ensue.
Bitcoin and gold will shine in this environment. 
The US will eventually follow Europe.

I just started reading The Internet of Money and I'm more excited about BTC than ever before. 
Bitcoin will be the language spoken in the future. The new language of money. Andreas Antonopoulos just opened my view of how to look at money. 


Just think about that for a second. Our entire system as we know is leaving and changing. From trading shells and beads, to gold and from gold to paper and paper to credit cards. Now it's time for Bitcoin to change how we view value and how we communicate it to one another.  
I don't even care what it goes to in terms of USD because the USD one day will no longer be considered anything of value. It will be looked at as an ancient artifact that served its purpose for that time period. It will be the Latin of the language world.

**Bad** debt dilutes all money, ie unserviceable debt.
Good debt actually creates wealth not only for you but for the entire economy.
You want to start a business but don't have 1 million dollars. You borrow the money and are able to build up your own wealth and others from those you employ. This in turn should create a better economy.
On the flip side if you borrow money and have no means of paying it back creates a stress on others from poor management, ie layoffs, default on loans, etc. 
Debt isn't bad.

They typically preach buying VIX below 12 as insurance. They speak about the current environment and how the market hasn't gone anywhere in the past 18 months and what the repercussions may be for a prolonged tariff war. They speak about what should be or could be good trades in the tariff war such as Twitter which won't be affected much with any tariffs. 
They are also GREAT contrarian indicators. Goldman Sachs said yesterday was a good buying opportunity for Bitcoin? Now look.
There are multiple occasions when CNBC covers Bitcoin that the price drops. Use it how you want. They aren't scamming anyone. Currently their bullish on gold. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say there will be a correction in gold in the coming weeks.

Gold looks exactly like bitcoin in this place and time after a large run up and bear market. I disagree with this chart above.
Looking at gold in comparison to bitcoin, we have been in the re-accumulation stage in gold for quite some time (since 2016) after the last lowest low was made, the capitulation. That capitulation led to the accumulation then expansion and so forth.
The longer a market stays in consolidation, the larger the move. Now granted this doesn't mean we won't just retest the lower end of the re-accumulation again and stay in it for years, but it shows the beginning of the next bull market in gold and most likely commodities.
We are at a technical point where gold has begun maker higher lows. It's just now starting to retest the 1360/oz zone. We'll just have to wait and see. Gold will once again go parabolic. Silver should follow and on a much larger magnitude.
r/bitcoin may not want to admit it, but re-accumulation can last years

Something that no one here would want to see unless you're a true hodler:  [
Some reasons that this scenario may play out is that we are in fact in a recession and a liquidity crisis like the one in 08' will cause a massive selling in things like equities, precious metals, oil/gas, and now bitcoin.
Bitcoin along with precious metals will be the best things to own **after** the recession has run its course and then we will see this 50k and above. This isn't to say bitcoin will be worth 50k. Do not look at 50-100k as you being "rich", see it as fiat becoming worth less and bitcoin becoming a true safe asset to own.
The other reason this may not happen is of course the halving that will happen next year. Plan B on twitter gives a great chart on stock to flow which portrays bitcoin is actually at fair value and should continue upwards to 100k after the halving event. However, stock to flow really doesn't matter if market psychology is at play. People panic and don't give a shit about what your stock to flow chart says.

Imagine a day when the United States as a whole collapses and a liquidity crash much like the '08 recession happens once more only this time it's on a global scale. The US dollar, ie the global reserve currency is hoarded. A big sell of in equities because banks need cash, a panic sell from 401ks, a panic sell from Roth IRAs. And just like that hard assets like precious metals, real estate and bitcoin are wanted. Cash is now king.
Those people in Greece when their government went out could only take out like $100 per day from their own bank accounts! Technically any money you have in the bank isn't yours. You loaned the bank your money. They pay you a minute rate and in some cases a negative rate. They can just keep your money. They need it in a liquidity crisis anyway. They do not care about your needs.
You can't leave the country you're in with precious metals, cash, gems. Much too obvious. You're stuck, unless maybe you thought ahead and opened a few Swiss bank accounts or own a private jet. This is where bitcoin comes in to play. We don't really see it being a huge issue, but you need to prepare in case this issue does arise, and it will arise. Negative interest rates are a norm. A tax on people saving. Consumerism is not consumerism if you are coerced to do so. It's a failed system. Negative interest rates don't work! And if monetary policy cannot handle it by interest rates or QE, then fiscal policy will attempt to do so by taxes, spending and you know it...debt. You put your savings and money in the hands of the politicians now.
If you just take a look at the repo markets in the US, you see this liquidity crisis happening now. The Fed is loaning out massive one day loans essentially because the banks are running short on cash to pay for their daily operations. This isn't to say the doomsday event or huge black swan will happen (the government and major banks do not want that happening!). It is only to say that this possibility is looming. The one where your own money has been inflated so much because of money printing in the form of the government buying treasuries from banks, ie QE. QE4 is on the horizon.
The whole reason China wants Hong Kong is due to Hong Kong's trading in US currency. No one wants China's BS currency. No one trusts it. Nations trust the US dollar. Once the dollar can't be trusted, you're left with nothing but the basics. Precious metals and land. Bitcoin is now player 3.

Edit2: The more I look at his comments, since this is a day old account, the more I know he's just trolling. 
" Too bad I still can't use it as money. I get paid in "useless" fiat money, and that is what I use to pay for goods and services. Just like you and everyone else around here. The only real benefit of Bitcoin is that we can speculate in it, and if we are lucky we can make tonnes of **real money.** 
Yeah the fiat is the real money. Uh huh.

Long time before we get any meaningful push higher.
@_date: 2019-12-06 16:14:45
Useless? I beg to differ. 
Go look at this sub when Bitcoin was 3k and then recently when it was 14k. 
I don't need everyone bearish. I just need this sub and most posts here to begin the "hodl" and "I feel like I made a huge mistake" talk. I've been buying Bitcoin and GBTC. Waiting on lower prices.

From Dave the Wave on Twitter:  [ 
We probably have a much longer time to digest the recent run up in Bitcoin. This is actually very good. The alt coins/shit coins will die off. The noise will be gone and hodlers and investors will accumulate. My prediction is the halvening may have a run up, but not 50k by next year. The math is there, investor sentiment is not.

@_date: 2019-12-16 04:12:27
Look at his comment history. He thinks Bitcoin is useless and fiat is the real money. 
His account is a day old. He's here to stir the pot and troll.

Zero Hedge is this permabear, know it all/fear monger. The debt is 105 trillion from the article which I'm not sure where that number is found exactly (maybe added social security/medicare into the mix).
Not all debt is bad especially if the debt can be serviced. Debt is needed to build an economy. Debt for governmental purposes is a great idea.

In a liquidity crisis this is exactly what happens, everything sells off. However, once the crisis is over, gold and Bitcoin will be where you want to be.
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:31:00
A lot of people buy breakouts in price as well. They buy momentum.
Buying all time highs or new highs for the month/year isn't actually the worst idea. However, buying all time lows or new lows is much riskier and stupid IMHO because you're attempting to catch a falling knife.

@_date: 2019-09-29 21:02:28
Really? I don't think you understand "investing" then. 
If I'm going to invest in a house and I need a place to store cash, do you honestly think Bitcoin is the go to in that scenario in this time period? Putting it in USD is a good idea, ie a good investment.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:59:45
When you decide to sell because you can't take it anymore let us know, thatll be the bottom.

1k bitcoin would be blood
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:02:39
Probably need a good scare to shake out weak hands. 
Hoping to jump in near 8k and anything lower. 
My personal guess is that this will consolidate much longer than anyone could imagine around 9000-12000 until we near the halving date. Hopefully that's completely wrong and it moons.
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:48:55
Says the guy arguing against the USD as a place to store some capital on the r/bitcoin sub yet somehow isn't talking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:18:46
you're joking right? 
You bought 2k pods due to potential scarcity by regulations?
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:03:14
You can recover cash if you lose it either.
It's not like you go to the bank and say "Hey I lost $10 today, here's a picture of the bill and serial numbers. This is proof I owned it."
Crypto being risky and volatile is why no one is adopting it.
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:44:16
No doubt. I'm obviously for bitcoin if I'm on this sub. It's a bit ridiculous to call the anchor on CNBC a clueless blonde bimbo for asking an honest question.
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:27:36
It's not a bad question to be honest and looking at volatility, it's better to own the USD vs. BTC.
Sure Bitcoin can go to 100k next year or crypto winter ensues and it's down to 1k. If I'm a conservative investor and don't want to risk losing my capital, then the USD is a good place to store it for now.
Emphasis on the words "for now"

How old are your parents and how much have they been saving since they began working?
I honestly can't see your parents not being able to retire with SS and medicare. Maybe not the best life but not terrible. Listen this bull market isn't over. It's not even close to being over. Now will there be another gut wrenching recession that possibly has already started? Yes. Absolutely. The thing about the market is that we're entering the age of machines, where companies can just push aside human workers for faster and more efficient automation. This will inherently lead to more profit in the beginning until the companies have bought back so much stock to artificially beat their EPS and people can no longer afford anything even at low prices. Who knows when the stock market will finally be over and every corporation will be private, owned by the big shots. 
Your parents will be fine.

Averaging typically over long term is a worse strategy for returns. 
Going all in now is much better especially for those of you believing it will reach 50k. Psychologically it may not be better.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:50:42
No lol. Bitcoin is showing signs of being overbought currently. CNBC is talking about it. I'm not saying it can't stay overbought but an 80% move in a month is a lot and should consolidate.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:43:41
Shhhh r/Bitcoin becomes full of crazies when the price goes up a lot in a short amount of time
Hopefully BTC consolidates for a few months so this sub can go back to being normal.
