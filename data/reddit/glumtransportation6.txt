%15, what a pathetic scam. You will go to prison when the government reviews your transactions and finds out that you are mostly facilitating fraud. 
Your price is so high that ever single transaction qualifies for a SAR, check the box "Little or no concern for product performance penalties, fees, or tax consequences"
Plenty of ATM much cheaper in Vegas. Make sure to use coin atm radar, click on city and sort by fee.

So crypto capital "maybe" stole money, pathetic regulators try to shit on Bitfinex instead of going after CC? LOLZ

uhh yeah a bankrupt exchange without banking certainly isn't the right price
@_date: 2019-04-30 04:56:02
 No one give a fuck what the price is for an exchange whose price is artificially inflated because people are buying Btc to flee the exchange
