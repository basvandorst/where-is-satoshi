 I'm not sure I understand; I'm not looking for smart contracts of financial instruments, just a payment system. No dividends needed, or anything like that.
I don't know much about Conterparty Assets or Colored coins. As I understand them, they fundamentally rely on other currencies, wether it's BTC or XCP, right?
I'm affraid that might be a bit complicated to explain to people that aren't yet versed in the crypto markets.
Anyway, Thanks for the advice, I'll look into these.

A database? What do you mean?
I'm sorry,  I'm no engineer ;/

First of all, thanks for the explanations, now I have a couple of questions.


The thing is, I really like all things decentralized. In the scenario I'm describing, the only part that Has to be centralized is the coin/token creation. I figured, for the security of users, ease of deployment, etc a blockchain could keep working no matter what happens to the creator.




Yeah,so...  I kind of knew that, and I should have been more careful about the words I used. 
The question I wondered about was: what do you need to make a network function with a block reward at 0?
I never mined myself, and given the fluctuating value of Bitcoin, the growth of the network, and people's expectations, I don't really know what kind of transaction fees would be needed to make it work.

Yeah, I guess the idea I have is just tokens, sold for a set price.

But I don't want that!


Yeah, that makes sense. What I meant was, what happens when block reward goes to zero, and what kind of transaction fee will you see/need then for the network to survive?
