Hiding incompetence would be worse

The genesis coins can't move

Well if you don't, you are accepting an insecure version of 'bitcoin'.

If bitcoin isn't anti-fragile, if it needs censorship and fear mongering to succeed, it isn't an interesting technology after all and I would rather see it fail.
There is only one way to resolve this conflict, and it's clearly not coming from the coredevs. They had their chance and they blew it. 
This notion of coredev consensus is ridiculous and is exactly what I hate about the political and monentary system. People in power making decisions thinking they know what is best. Well guess what, you don't. 
The most valuable thing of bitcoin, if you ask me, is that nobody has total control and everybody can be replaced. This includes coredevs.
I really hope we are going to see this fork play out. Regardless the outcome. A fork will perhaps not look pretty in the short run, but I believe it will make bitcoin stronger in the end. Besides it can't be worse than the discussion about it.

As soon as a 2MB block gets mined it will be accepted only by nodes running the new version. The old nodes will disregard it and wait for the next 1MB block that is created by a miner running the old software.
As long as the majority of the miners is running the old code, any chain containing a 2MB block will eventually be orphaned. 
When the 2MB version gets the majority of the hashing power the chain becomes irreversible and will split off from the original chain.
All nodes running old software will still have a blockchain with only 1MB blocks. 
What they will notice is a significant decrease in the hashing rate. It will become vulnerable to 51% attacks. Miners and merchants will switch to the new software and the old chain dies off.

What does he even mean with 'bitcoin developer mainstream'?

We should call them taxes and miners should be called regulators

That may be true, but to be fair. Every single bitcoin developer disagreed with satoshi at some point. Where would we be right now if satoshi stood behind mainstream opinion. I'm not taking a side in the discussion, just saying that this is a non-argument.

That's it, they just lost me as a customer

I call bullshit, you don't tweet by mistake. They miscalculated and now they are crawling back.

Please elaborate on why that would be useful
