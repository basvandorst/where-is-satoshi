If you follow a couple of his outgoign transactions, it might be a lot worse than you think
Edit: That might actually be an exchange, if you were able to figure out which exchange it is, they'll know what account the coins were credited to, and maybe something will happen. But probably not, because the people running exchanges dont care as long as they get their 1%

But there is enough, there is essentially an unlimited amount of BTC. If theres 215 trillion (usd worth of money) in the world, BTC would only need to be worth the equivalent of $10m usd by todays standards to take that burden

@_date: 2018-01-24 09:51:59
Ya, whats really important is the liquidity, volume being traded, and how much of that is unique (idk how to explain it, im sure theres a phrase, but an exchange might trade 200 btc in 24 hours, but it might just be 40 btc traded 5 times if you get what im trying to say), and how much fiat is being put in
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:01:43
But the 21m hardcap doesnt matter, as it is potentially infinitely divisible and we just use decimals anyway. Theres no difference between a cap of 21m or 2.1m, because we just use 0.01 or 0.001 instead, it's exactly the same.

When coming into a windfall like this, it's also important to stay calm, don't tell anybody, and make a plan for what you will do with the money, otherwise you will end up blowing it all and regretting everything. People will likely beg you for some of it, including on here, dont give any of it away. It's yours, use it wisely. Pay off any student loans/debt you have, have an accountant that knows about bitcoin help you to file for capital gains if applicable in your country, don't blow it on an expensive car, I'd say keep 80% as a minimum, after paying any debts, to invest. This could be a deposit on a house, it could be a term deposit with a bank, it could be stocks. That's up to you to decide. Give your parents a hug, and make sure they don't tell people either if you do chose to let them know.

Are you actually trying to argue against single payer healthcare here? I've never seen an argument against it that makes logical sense. And it's not free, it's funded by taxes. The same as military and police are, because privatising them completely would also be a stupid idea

Why do many Americans come to New Zealand for healthcare though?
Public healthcare doesn't remove private healthcare from existence for those that have the means and desire for better treatment.


What country? I live in a country that also has private and public hospitals.


Malpractice always exists. Doctors don't just not make mistakes because the govt isnt involved, they're human
 


You claim you're from a central American country, I'm assuming not USA or you would have said that. You also claim USA has the best healthcare. But now you're saying that your country has the best healthcare. Not really following you. 
I too, can go to a good doctor, see them for an hour, yes the actual doctor, and it's cheap. 


I'd also be able to do this no problem if I chose, however I'm 24 and have no kids and don't feel the need to.


Umm no. The doctor/nurse decides who gets care. ie. if you have no medical problem you don't get care. If you have a medical problem you get care. People don't walk into hospital with a broken arm and get turned away because they have no insurance.


Maybe in a fucked up, 3rd world corrupted as hell country (eg. USA). But not where I'm from. literally never heard of private healthcare being outlawed.


Corruption isn't an issue for us. Long wait times can be on occasion, but never for anything serious. You always have the option for private healthcare if you want. Quality of care isn't perfect, but it's acceptable. Doctors are motivated because they don't want to lose their ability to practice and their handsome salaries. 


So thats not true at all, and if you think it is, it's because you've been fed some bullshit by big pharma. Single payer healthcare systems are soooo fucking much cheaper than what a private USA hospital will pay for the same drugs. Our govt isn't fucked up and corrupted to the same level as USA so that favour swapping isn't acceptable here, people go to jail for that shit. 


I'm not a socialist. However if you are what i believe a republican is, it's purely logical to adopt NZ's healthcare system.Americans are already PAYING MORE IN TAXES THAN ME FOR HEALTHCARE. And i actually get healthcare for my money. You're getting ripped the fuck off. So yea, the money is already there, just gotta sort out that corruption, and get yourself a public healthcare system. Because low income workers don't have healthcare as an option, they are less productive, it is simply and purely financially logical to provide public healthcare, even if you added it on as extra tax and ignore the healthcare money USA is burning for no reason.

Food doesnt put people into bankruptcy like private healthcare does. And in a way, with social welfare we do pool for food for those in need. 
Food is also a consistant cost, your food bill cant suddenly go to $400k out of the blue if youre in a car crash. 
Access to healthcare should be a basic human right, the same as access to fresh water, education and freedom of speech 
Linking healthcare to communism is just absurd. USA isn't even a democracy. New Zealand is. And we have healthcare.

if you're worried about mutants, a few rounds of ammo isn't going to help in the long run, I'd take the hatchet. Iodine tablets would only last for so long, and either you'll be somewhere with a ready supply of w/e is needed to survive, ie an advanced civilisation however with radiation, or a nuclear wasteland where you'll die quickly anyway. SO I wouldnt take the tablets. iPhones are shit, so wouldnt want one anyway, but less jsut assume they mean any high end modern phone; chances are, it'll be useless for communication, it'll be either post-civilisation wasteland mad max type shit where you'll get a few hours to play games until it runs out of battery, or it'll be advanced civ where the tech is outdated, theres no way to charge it, it won't be able to make calls, you'll okay games for a few hours and it's useless, maybe see it to a museum? A tarp is nice and all, but it's easy enough to make shelter without one assuming that the place is habitable anyway.
So i'd take a bitcoin. On the off chance it's used as a currency (hardly any chance, but it'd be worth a fuck load) or it's valuable as a historical item (like ancient coins are today). And the hatchet. Can't go wrong with a hatchet

Ok thanks, but how does the paper wallet work? Like, can i just transfer BTC to it whenever i want from my mtgox account? And how do i log into the paper wallet to use the bitcoins?

How come its a 3 month delay? Also, i can easily trade the bitcoins from my mtgox account, to another account and sell them on another marketplace  right? I decided on mtgox because they seemed to be the biggest, and i currently live in japan, so i thought it would be a good place to start. Whats your recomendation? Im planning on using it as long term savings, rather than trading for a profit, as im 19 i figured it seemed logical to put my spare cash in a higher risk investment, and i like the look of bitcoins

Thankyou very much, ive been so confused these last few days trying to figure it all out

Everything has flaws, but bitcoins have less flaws than fiat, therefore we shall prevail

Just because people are having problems in the usa doesnt mean mtgox isnt real, usa is what, 5% of the worlds population? Stop being so self important

So, when you have a private and public key, how do you use the btc in it?
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:34:32
Bitcoin is magical internets money, basically the idea is that its a de centralized, finite currency, that can be used anywhere in the world, potentially its an international currency, and i think everyone should spend a bit of time researching it, even if your not interestd in getting any
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:24:13

Wats an ounce of gold worth? I dont use those funny numbers
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:06:04
Im in japan. Will happily accept it for err... services... lmk :p
OT: yea cash is king, i even get paid in cash (unsure if tax is actually paid on it still) and the banking/atm fees are rediculous, along with the 0.1% interest you get on savings. The only reason to use a bank here is so that your cash doesnt burn in a fire (although, this is the purpose of a bank). I do beleive japan would benefit massivly from the use of btc, but am unsure how readily they would accept it. Also, i think that something like 25% of internet sales in japan are from people 60+ so although there is a massive ages proportion at the higher end and a decline in birthrates and population overall, old people here seem more willing to use technology than other countries.  
Tldr: japan could have some of the biggest benefits from btc out of every country in the world
