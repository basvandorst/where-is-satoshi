Ok thanks for the help guys but I'm a noob when it comes to BTC so like lets say I wanted to transfer 20BTC, how many bytes is that? How can I calculate it?

Then how do I sell Monero for cash in hand? The one thing I like about btc is that I can go on LBC and sell them. Can I only sell Monero through an exchange?

I'm not sure what that means?

Gotcha. Maybe I should just use a BTC exchange to be safer?

well they sent me an email saying that an unknown IP was trying to access my account and if it wasn't me, then I should click the link below to freeze my account, which I did. Then I went and changed the password and emailed them to unfreeze my account but no response (granted its only been like 10 hours)

Hey guys can someone recommend a good site to turn BTC into fiat and withdraw via bank transfer for US customers? I had a Coinbase account but they lowered my limits years ago. I have been using Gemini for awhile but someone recently hacked my account so I had to freeze my account and I don't know how long the process takes to unfreeze it. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks!
