They put everything CUSTOMERS had to arrive at the 36%.
Owners of bitfinex are not hit. And this is where scam potential lies. They will bail out with customers money, while still owning, controlling and having profit from company rescued with customers money.
This is one big difference from bankruptcy: Bankruptcy leaves guys who made it possible (owners) WITHOUT company. Proposed bail out leaves owners with perfectly live company. The company which will be credited with some tokens - read some kind of debt but of really weak security.
Big problem is here that there is no penalty for shareholders. They made mistake (improper security measures) and are not hit by the result. They just take customers money to pay for this mistake while retaining ownership of company. And no, vague mentioned TOKEN (some kind of debt: mark my words) is not a solution.
We're clearly letting the world know: please come, and scam us, we will bail it out. Possible penalty of bankruptcy (loss of company) prohibits another wannabe-businessman from starting yet-another-bitcoin-exchange-2be-hacked.

State of US banking (and people acceprance of it) always amazes me. In Europe you can do cross bank transfers for free or for fixed amount around 1usd. 
Oh, and they take 1 day max. Cross borders, as domestic are hours.
