My BTC withdrawal has now been processing for 3 hours, should I contact support or is the queue really this long?

A few questions:
1. Will the express wire option still be present? If so, will it still be "within 24 hours"?
2. Are you aiming for withdrawals and trading to go active at the same time?
3. When will creation of API tokens be permitted again?

So if you opened a margin long, the bitcoins were transferred to your BitGo wallet?

If you sync once per day can you explain why bitcoins I purchased on exchange on the 30th June were not synced to my Bitgo wallet?

Seems they've stopped topping up the hot wallet now?

What will be the turnaround on BTC withdrawals once requested? 10 mins? 1 hour? ... ?

Is this just due to staff going home for the evening?
What are the hours (UTC) we can expect crypto withdrawals to be processed during?
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:14:08
So 09:00-17:00 CEST?
Have you stopped processing withdrawals for today now?

I dropped you message but I imagine it's drowned in your inbox:
What is the appropriate contact and required documents for updating the bank account registered on my BFX account?

With regard to active loans provided for BTCUSD positions, what time (UTC) will this be as of?
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:58:05
How are USD loans being treated in this situation? Does the provider simply lose 36% of the USD loaned?

Coins are now on the move from the cold wallet:

While this may have been true normally, I purchased BTC on 30/07/16 and these were **not** settled to my BitGo wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:03:13
I also received mine (UK)

I'll be in Phnom Penh in a week or so. I'll try and drop in.
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:15:02
Ditto. I even tweeted at them to tell them I was sad I was being forced to order from Scan.
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:22:47
I've used this service a number of times and each transaction has been flawless.

I just did a withdrawal and it was processed within a few minutes:
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:29:43
I've also ordered from Overclockers and as says, their customer service is excellent should anything need replacing.
I've also ordered through Scan and had them process a refund for a BTC paid order which went smoothly.

Probably a bizarre question, but what actually happens at these meet ups apart from a few drinks?

Definitely a wallet-stealer, the official sourceforge page is
