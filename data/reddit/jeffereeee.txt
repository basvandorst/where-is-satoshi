This is why we locksmiths are CRB checked in the UK. Trust is a huge part of our work.

I thought this 3 years ago, bought back then thinking, this is a lot of money to loose if it goes tits up. But I always had the intention I'm in for the long haul. I had about 6 months of negative profit. But stayed true to my thinking and stuck it out. 
Now, well the figures are great, although I don't get to excited when it goes up and up like it is now. 
Still in for the long haul. 
Basically if you have the dollar, then by in. But don't risk any dollar your not prepared to loose or leave in for a long time. 
I'm not cashing out until I have enough to buy a property out right, it's a risk yes, but my initial investment was pretty small in comparison to what I may gain.

Bought in at $1.2k, I thought at the time, wow this is risky. I sat in a dip for a few months, then just let it ride. Now, well wow things are looking pretty bloody good. 
I’m now in a position to invest £25k and I’ve been waiting for a dip, but to hell with it gonna spend those £ today. 
It’ll be the best investment you ever did Josh.

And that’s why I’ve been investing into bitcoin for nearly 5 years now, that’s not thinking I’ll get rich quick in my book, it’s long rearm investment in something I’ve believed in from the early days when I bought my first coin at $2:5.

Why do you think it’ll make me rich, is that what I think? That bike makes me at least feel free.

Since I’ve been investing in bitcoin for the best part of 5 years now, supporting it, and believing in it. Not looking at it as a get rich quick scheme. But more long term investment. I really don’t need to bullshit anyone. But thanks for the comment.
