WOWWWWWW &amp; right before I could get my sell at $19,250.....&amp; it tanks to fucking $16,700. BULLSHIT. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:19
It rejected my fucking limit sell....wtf. I could be buying back in now for $16,500.

When Bitcoin hit over $19k &amp; “crashed” before I could sell...

I dabble in day trading, specifically FOREX. I also do Binary Options on NADEX.
I “day trade” Crypto, BTC &amp; LTC, but only a few trades a day really. I have a nice chunk of change to make profits off of these 5-10% jumps (which happens pretty frequently). I’m no expert, but I have 4 degrees in engineering &amp; business, while getting my doctorate in Systems Engineering currently, so I’m pretty well versed with forecasting. I could make a lot more, but I play it safe &amp; usually sell prematurely before it hits it’s peak before dropping again. I have had a few loses, but they were negated because I would sell for a loss to put into another crypto that was breaking out. I have a decent understanding of Fibonacci retracement, Japanese candlestick charting patterns, etc. Unfortunately, due to my job, schooling, &amp; having my daughter half the time, I can’t trade as much as I’d like. I can tell you that I haven’t bought back in since I purchased BTC when it was $600-$1200. I’m looking to break into other cryptos (Monero, Ripple, IOTA), so I may invest some more on other exchanges (currently getting the run around from Kraken ��). Maybe I’m just lucky, but I have been pretty successful, but I’m also kicking myself for not being able to sell when BTC spiked past $19,000. I tried selling at $19,250 but GDAX crashed �� &amp; I was only able to sell later on when it spiked again in the mid $17,000s. That cost me a much higher gain, but I’m content with what I made off of it.

If I had more time to day trade, I’d probably fail at it due to my lack of patience. Luckily, I can’t monitor pricing alot...otherwise I’d prematurely panic sell all the time &amp; lose my ass. ��

If I’m not mistaken, generally it’s the 60/40 rule. 60% taxed as long-term gains, 40% taxed at your regular income tax rates (whatever bracket you fall in). Correct me if I’m wrong though. It may be situational of course depending on the quantity &amp; duration.

It’s like double dutch...I’m not sure when I want to jump back in ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:21
�� Firstly, the sample size (such a short duration) is too small to even deduce such a thing yet. Secondly, the volatility seems to be the same to me so far, including the spike that happened when the futures launched.

That’s cute. Get a better one. This should just be a hobby to acquire more fun coupons. Quit crying about what others “did” to you &amp; do more for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:51:39
if I were you &amp; this is true...sell sell sell. Pay the taxes &amp; never look back.

Meh, can’t automate away my job. If anything, I help reduce the workforce. ��

The volatility makes cryptocurrencies ideal for people that actually know how to trade.
It’s not that hard, IMO.

Pumping up Bcash? Where? Shits been on a steady decline all damn day.
