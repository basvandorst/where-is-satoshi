On it. Nicknames need to be alphanumeric right now, but I realize other characters are useful too!

Double awesome! We created the site for "digital goods" but our first user was selling sandwiches and crepes! So obviously real-world, tangible goods work too!

Thanks for the suggestion. That totally makes sense and we haven't implemented it yet. v2.0?

Can you please try using   to check out the status of your transfer?
When that address receives your BTC, we receive them and forward you on to what you just bought. I'll start looking into our logs, but I'd love to see the status of that too please!

That's the point! We wanted to be secure, anonymous place to facilitate Bitcoin sales!

You're telling me! I'm a coder - not a graphic designer! I know it needs work haha

I have my CS (+co-op) degree and have taken several classes with encryption methods.
I understand your point though, since we need our code to be secure in order to keep our Wallet secure. We spent some time on Friday working on that!

It actually says "No Transaction Fees" twice on the page- once at the top and once in the benefits section. Should we add "Free to Use"? lol

We're actually not competing with credit cards, perse. We're 'competing' (for lack of a better term) with other "Bitcoin for Merchant" services, right?
