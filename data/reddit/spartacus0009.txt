Yes because it’s over inflation which draws down the BTC price, and they can produce as many as they like.
It means BTC is being buggered and anyone who’s putting money in.

Yeah and waiting for another whale to buy OTC and dump on an exchange, then buy up again, and on the buy dump cycle goes.

How can this mean anything with the clear declining demand, that has taken a grip on this market.
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:35:52
You are correct in what you say, but all of what you say is irrelevant, real bitcoins aren’t needed now, CME have over come those supply issues and which is real and which is not, by creating a kind of fractional reserve BTC, “paper IOU futures to be exact “ so nothing matters now because they can inflate the 21 million supple everyday of the week and still make money.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:53:55
M8 just think about what you’ve just said, then go away because you clearly don’t get it.
Quote they would have to sell the daily mined supply to keep the price stable, hahahaha, the price has been collapsing what does that tell you.
Well I’ll explain it for you, it means more are selling than buying.
And that’s why it’s more fake adoption crap.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:17:05
Firstly you say people are told, they are not told because they don’t know about this manipulation, so innocents buying BTC are throwing their money away.
And yes Wall Street don’t own the bitcoins correct because they don’t need to, and because they’re circumnavigating buying them, they aren’t creating demand thus they can suppress the price for as long as they choose and by how much they choose depending on how many contracts they sell.
So owning BTC has become less relevant, now institutional investor don’t need wallets, private and public keys and they don’t need all the other hassles that go with BTC, what they can now do is short BTC all day long and hedge themselves with these futures contracts.
Nobody is saying real BTC that are connected to the Blockchain are fake, I am saying these contracts reproduce BTC, with inflates the supply.
It is a genius move by them, it gives them control over the price while still being able to profit from all the hard work without lifting a finger.
I am saying nakamoto didn’t envisage his set 21 million supply actually being able to be manipulated like this.
Secondly you’re claiming that BTC is completely decentralised, well part of its ecosystem are not, like exchanges and the fact the IRS make people pay tax on it, and like the fact that for it to move forward it has to have clearance from financial government bodies.
That is far from decentralised, also because BTC couldn’t scale and still can’t on chain, it’s had a second layer in “LN” adapted which is not decentralised, far from it.
Also Blockstream pretty much choose what is added and what isn’t, you I or anyone else apart from the miners get to choose, and talking of miners I would say elements of the larger pools and their mining hardware monopoly are very close to being centralised.
Then there is the fact that only a few wallets own most of the BTC, so much in fact they can manipulate the market at will, yet again this is not true decentralisation, this talk of it being so is a fallacy.
Then there is this myth about adoption which is a complete lie, supply and demand works one of  two ways, increased demand = higher prices, negative demand will bring lower prices, and this is what you’re seeing each time the price tanks, or as previously said manipulation.
Bitcoin cannot support its self and the miners without a decent price and a decent return for the mining effort, as with all markets once the price gets to a certain low, that will signal a complete sell off, when this happens all market confidence will have gone, and BTC will be taken over by a better crypto.
And you answered your own question on decentralisation when you mention, first,
Second, or third layer, I’m afraid you can’t have it both ways either it is a decentralised system or part of it is.
Sorry I’m ����‍♂️, laughing now.

@_date: 2018-12-11 06:16:37
Nobody is buying or the price would be moving up, unless now everyone buys OTC, all these headlines are rubbish, with mo supporting evidence, because price high is the only evidence one needs of adoption.
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:16:53
You can be sure of one thing “NO WAY” will they get SEC approval for settlement in BTC, because depending on how popular their product is, if popular it could push BTC price through the roof, they are not going to let this happen.
Forget BAKKT and all these other crap hats out there.
Oh and because most people know this and are relying upon these price gains, they’re going to be very disappointed, because upon the news they won’t settle in BTC, the BTC price will tank lower than it is today for sure.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:54:56
Really, did you read?
No ones said they were real BTC, the point is they don’t need to be, if you understand the reasons why they don’t need real bitcoins to create false paper ones, no one can help you.
It’s a distortion for the sake of inflating the BTC supply, it’s effective at controlling the BTC price, the same tactics used in the gold market.

Now put your thinking cap on which may I add often when you reply to posts you do not have on “CLEARLY”, rewind to your previous posts where you’ve called BITCOIN, “SOUND MONEY”, yet here you are now admitting that it’s manipulated.
Sorry, but sound money wouldn’t be sound if it was manipulated in such a way.
I openly admit all other markets aren’t sound in that respect, BUT BTC IS “MEANT TO BE DIFFERENT RIGHT”.
No you cannot have it both ways.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:38:02
Yes your correct and when you tell anyone this on reddit you get down voted, simple fact high price = high demand, Low price means adoption isn’t happening, I’ve been hammering this home for a long time, no one listens because they’re brain washed.
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:04:11
������, works haha, that’s why it needs multiple centralised layers added to it, and know one know whether they even work securely yet.
Don’t be pathetic, it doesn’t work and most of it isn’t decentralised.
Oh and if it did work it’s price wouldn’t be tanking and miners wouldn’t be packing in, or short selling their own market.
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:35:01
1) if Bitcoin is sound money, it’s price would have to be stable, for people to know exactly what it’s worth, and for there to be mass confidence.
2) whether bitcoins can’t be manipulated on the open Blockchain (meaning) their rate of supply and their total amount, which for arguments sake would make it sound money, but because third parties can manipulate its price for their own benefit, calling it “SOUND MONEY” is a blatant all out lie.
3) its system can’t be interfered with we get that, but via external practices it can be controlled, manipulated, and it’s adoption can be severely limited via one means or another.
4) for this to be called sound money, all of what I’ve pointed out would have to be eradicated, and mass adoption would have to take place for price volatility  to be curbed, adoption isn’t happening for many reasons so SOUND MONEY isn’t here yet.
5) selling a lie when you know the truth is a fools errand.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:21:41
But you do realise those added layers are centralised don’t you, they have centralised hubs, so that’s not decentralised is it.
And also LN isn’t capable of transferring large payments, it’s only designed for smaller payment, large transactions should be done on chain, this isn’t ground breaking, plus also they are struggling to get certain aspects running properly.
BTW, Bitcoin has been out preformed last year by four shares and stocks so NO it’s not the highest preforming asset this decade, but then you’re not likely to know this because you are not an investor, if you were you’d know people have made higher returns than crypto.
Oh and bitcoin transfer isn’t slowwww like gold, because gold isn’t a digital transfer and gold isn’t used to transfer funds.
Swift is used to transfer funds in the banking system, Bitcoin is slow because it couldn’t scale ��, that’s a pretty big mistake.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:37:41
In this circumstance please don’t think, let others think for you, because you are going against sound money and it’s practices, that credit line isn’t what BTC is meant to be about.
Credit is spending in most cases what you don’t own or have, it will inflate BTC in another bad way.

Fractional reserve bitcoin is not good for the bitcoin price, if you read the white paper and understand supply and demand, you’ll realise by creating more BTC than exist as the original algorithm has set, means you’ll do away with the demand hence you’ll lower the price.
Yes if you’re not bothered about price rises and you want a stable coin that will function as a global payment, go ahead and devalue it, but devalue is what you’ll do, that is what fractional reserve is and does.
People who invested in BTC did so purely because of the limited supply, common sense supply and demand and FOMO, stated in the white paper price this vision of increases price due to demand or adoption.
What you are proposing is not good for price and it’s against what BTC was meant to be about, which is a set 21 million supply.

No it doesn’t work, it’s transaction capacity is virtually zero, it’s to transparent for business to use unless you want all of your competition knowing what you’re taking in and spending,and virtually no one uses it because (hodling and using are a contradiction) and the fundamentals are not right because it has many flaws the main ones are, it’s niche, it’s not doing anything that much better than already exists and it always relies on a bigger sucker to feed the sharks above.
And that’s without even going into the details of how it’s the most manipulated market on earth, plus the inflation of the BTC supply via bitcoin futures.

@_date: 2018-12-12 17:17:14
No the real answers are not that, satoshi even spoke of early adopter miners becoming rich, and he also stated the BTC loses would also enrich the other holders, so it’s clear he knew financial gain was part of the game “for sure”.
And the real answer to why BTC isn’t making money now is clearly the manipulation.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:18:37
Firstly you are missing the point that all the talk of institution money is now no more, the reason is that these contracts aren’t settled in BTC and like you said are settled in the price equivalent at the time the contract expires.
Buy your own words you’ve shown how the CME have eradicated all need to buy “physical core BTC”, thus declining the price and lowering demand.
This means they have no need for BTC wallets, private or public keys, and they also don’t have any headaches over security.
While they have these futures contracts as a hedge, they can now short sell BTC all day long, causing more instability and manipulation.
There are no physically settled contracts not now, and there won’t ever be, because they do not want a run away spiral of the BTC price threatening the banking system and their vested interests.
They can sell massive amounts of these futures contracts they are indeed fake BTC equivalent and they no doubt effect demand.
The Bitcoin market is now the most manipulated market on earth, and may I add will get worse in 2019, people who invest more money now in BTC are only feeding bigger sharks.
The public should be notified and protected from losing their savings as this has become a scam.
If you don’t believe how damaging this is for BTC, go and read about COMEX gold futures, you’ll soon see nakamotos flaw in his limited supply model, gold is no doubt limited right, but overinflated via COMEX which caps or lowers the price depending how many gold paper IOUs they sell.
Same thing fake gold, no one sees it, no one owns it, it’s just the fiat cash equivalent.
Fractional reserve models can be turned on anything that you think is limited supply and they inflate the supply and drive down demand.
Once you understand this you’ll see BITCOINS future is one of stagnation, tamed and compartmentalised along with its wild price swings.
BTC could well become a stable store of value.
About the same price as gold today I’d bet.
Hope you get time to read this link I think this should clearly show you FAKE is not an over exaggeration.
You may also see comparisons in what they have done in the past to what they are doing now in this link.
There are no doubt other factors to the bear market, but most of them also are crooked and smell of greed.
I do not think this was satoshi’s vision and I do not think he see’s BTC now any different to the establishments it was meant to circumnavigate.
Most people on reddit are either liars or self deniers, so there is no truth in debate anymore, downvoted for telling the truth or reported as a troll or accused for spreading FUD, when sometimes it’s not FUD it’s fact.
The community of BTC who like to think they protect it are killing it, with this unreasonable attitude that they have.
See the truth.

NO the system before when it had no value wasn’t worth attacking you fool, people didn’t even know about bitcoin.
Once the hash rate goes back there, every nation state will bring it down just for fun, when there is no security through financial gain its finished.
No coiners aren’t pissed of, they just don’t care, remember there are over 8 billion people on earth and the masses don’t want bitcoins, look at the price, what do you not understand.
It’s another fatal flaw in BTC thinking people will want it, but they don’t clearly.
As you’ve said it’s over 10 years old, 90 % of the population have heard of it now yet don’t want in ��.
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:47:42
I’m not trolling, if you understand futures you realise that the BTC supply is being over inflated, institutional investors do not need Bitcoins anymore, they have paper IOUs of fake BTC.
This is fact.
So the public aught to be told so they don’t lose money, what this campaign will do is lower demand, if demand is lowered the price will go down and down, more miners will leave and the whole system will become less secure.
Calculations show mast sell out around $1000 dollars as no one will want to be a bag holder.
Saying nothing can effect BTC is silly because the right bad news will destroy it.
People do not like fakes, and they don’t like being lied too.

Come back when you’ve studied.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:21:44
The idea price is equilibrium you haven’t seen that, you’ve seen nothing more that a vast sell of across the board.
There is a far higher supply than there is demand (period).
Also I’ll point out something that’s a complete lie, over the course of this year I’ve been calculating off the buy stories on reddit just how many BTC are or could have been sold, this includes OTC, institutional, first time BTC buyer, seasoned buy the dip buyers and all other that has been reported, now on those sales alone the BTC price should be in the late 20 thousand dollar region, based on how much BTC should be available.
But yet it’s a tiny amount, so someone’s a liar for one reason or another.
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:22:42

Bitcoin is governed and ruled by centralised authority that’s why bitcoin has to keep asking for permission from those financial regulators, that’s not decentralised.
Also you may be able to send a Bitcoin here or there, but the facts are the masses are not interested they have voted by not buying into it��.
And if you �� look at investing why would the public do that when evidence shows large wallet holders buying OTC and dumping on exchanges to crash the price and then buy back, the public aren’t interested it isn’t being adopted as the tanking price shows more are selling than buying.

That fine and I wouldn’t disagree apart from one point, and that is market confidence, that confidence only comes if people believe their returns will be worth the risk.
I assure you bitcoin stands on shaky foundations in this respect as it relies on a secure Blockchain, forget what anyone tells you, once prices are not profitable and mining pools throw in the towel, confidence and security also evaporate and this is end game.
This can happen and is dependent on how low prices will be driven by greedy short sellers and the like, even miners who are struggling to make profits now are turning the screws on themselves by adding to that short selling.
Banks print money on money when times are bad, in Bitcoin land they short sell, on short sell.
IRONY MY FRIEND.
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:13:13
Yes but there is a  flaw in nakamotos logic there, you see once the confidence has gone out of the market because bitcoin has gone backwards and the miners have left.
Even though the BTC are easier to mine as the difficulty lowers, most sane people would have realised by that time that it had failed in its mission.
Owning thousands of BTC that’s are worthless in a wallet is different to owning thousands that have value.
Public and market confidence are what matter not the mining difficulty, and only a fool would buy BTC if it ever went back there.
Logic rules.

@_date: 2018-12-12 18:01:18
Well you should realise then that people call BTC sound money because it’s meant to be incorruptible, personally I disagree but for your education we will say it is.
So as you know all BTC are stored on the open Blockchain, each time you or I make a purchase our balance is corrected down, as the receivers is balanced up, simple pay and receive.
If this was a debit card then that would be fine because you’d be spending your own BTC funds in the same way.
Because it’s credit, you don’t have to own those funds unlike a debit card which you do, so credit means people can spend what they don’t actually own, this in essence would cause more money velocity and money velocity causes inflation, and if someone defaults on their payments this causes even more inflation.
Do I have to explain what that means for BTC and the BTC price or can you work it out for yourself yet ��.

Anyone on reddit that wants to talk to me about BTC price or halving or any other issues like miner cost ect, please read and understand supply and demand, of a set and limited supply product.
I reiterate that a limited, fixed supply like Bitcoin, in times of high demand (adoption) can only make supply less, and this drive prices higher, once prices get to noticeable levels by the public or news channels FOMO kicks in, meaning more pressure on supply and more demand, meaning prices go higher and higher, this is terminal velocity in action.
Sell offs increase supply and lower demand and thus lower price.
Do not let anyone con you that adoption is spreading without price high.
Price low like now means no ones coming to the party SIMPLE.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:10:57
Declining since 2017, I am not skirting any questions not my style.
I didn’t know bitmex offered BTC settled futures contracts, thats not good news, really because that make my take on the BTC price even more pertinent, because they must buy BTC to settle those contracts so if they are buying large volume for that purpose that should be putting pressure on supply which it’s not.
So they’re either not selling many, or they aren’t settling all in BTC, meaning they must also settle in cash, me thinks more cash than BTC.
BAKKT no I don’t believe the SEC will allow them to settle in BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:36:43

I’m afraid to inform you, that you need lessons about how QE works, you are delusional in your thought pattern, you see typically you believe like many others that because Quantitive easing is used and extra liquidity injected into the financial system that, those funds are never payed down, but they are.
Before you say things like this please study the subject, you cannot call something SOUND MONEY when no one knows its value, please think about it, NOT KNOWING ITS VALUE, *yet saying this is sound money* it is a preposterous claim, that most economists laugh at.
And my answer to 4 is supply and demand, please read and understand it, when you do you’ll realise you can’t have low prices and high demand.
Oh and why do people into BTC revert back to comparing the dollar price or function when it’s not the dollar, and they believe it is better.
Why use the dollar, BTC is meant to be unique yet all you’ve used in your reply is dollar this or dollar that, SOUND MONEY is used by the masses, sound money is the dollar.
Also how weird that you conceive that BTC is manipulated like traditional markets, yet still say it’s sound money haha, come on, it was designed to be sound money but has failed through miscalculation and lack of knowledge on nakamotos part.
Simply put you’re believing this system to be incorruptible but you’ve admitted that is isn’t, so it can’t be sound money.
Oh one more issue I think you don’t understand is the link you sent about dollar inflation, you do realise that the same fractional reserve inflation can and is being used against BTCs set supply, meaning that the set 21 million supply can be increased through paper IOU futures contracts, so thinking BTC isn’t susceptible to this practice is ridiculous, yet another flaw in the BTC design.
On and on they keep appearing.

I respect your beliefs and I wish you well, but revolutions that don’t spill blood never work.
Contagion first, and wait for it to fizzle out, while in the real economy it’s business as usual.
The American administration won’t lose grip on power not ever.

Talking about decentralised systems on reddit is the ultimate irony, let’s face facts decentralised systems aren’t meant to be policed.
You only have to fart to loud on reddit and you will be banned by some ass wipe moderator.
Decentralised is tor, that’s is as good as it gets.
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:05:41
Bitcoin is a tiny ecosystem, like a flea on wall streets back, comparing the two is what an uneducated teenager would do.

Well there you go you’ve shown me something I didn’t know as I’m not a trader, so those physically backed futures on bitmex won’t cause supply issues or increase demand, so they won’t also effect the price, only the short selling of the products might in a negative way.
My point is these other futures contracts, BAKKT, CBOE,CME,  none have permission to settle in BTC, only cash settlement.
If the above had permission for BTC settled the price would sky rocket due to those institutions having to buy BTC on the open market to settle the contracts.
I’ve just stated the SEC will not allow this because it’s a way for them to keep a cap on the BTC price and alleviate any threat from BTC.
And because those contracts are cash settled no investors have to touch BTC or have the hassle, they can short sell it all day long and hedge themselves via those future contracts.
Decimating the BTC price.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:07:10
Everyone plugging hard for people to buy BTC more than ever, because the markets slowly collapsing and they know the only way to get it back is more suckers buying in.

How pathetic you should tell me about BTCs price I’m laughing, if you only knew, yes I’ll continue posting and along with our other campaigns it’s business as usual.
I never said it worthless yet, but I said it’s slowly eroding due to factors it has no control over.
Bitcoin halving haven’t done anything for the price in the past, and the forthcoming halving will have little effect either, education, education time, it’s supply and demand, cutting supply without demand doesn’t increase price, if you have demand and half the block reward fine then price high.
But we all know that demand isn’t there, people are selling off because they’re not sure how low BTC is going.
I mean fuck head if you did your homework you’d know Mike navogratz has been quietly selling along with other larger investors just in case it all goes south.
The price can only go so low before it’s uneconomical to mine, once that happens mining will cease and the systems security will be no more.
My prediction is, If no BTC settled contracts appear in the near future, it will witness a mass sell off, down to $1000, panic will set in and the house of cards will all come tumbling down.
I don’t care I’m not stupid enough to support it via owning manipulated stock.
The manipulation part is why the SEC can’t be arsed with it, and are just containing it.

Well firstly if you knew anything about economics you’d know that comparing debt to GDP is folly at the best of times when you’re talking about industrialised nation.
Look at Japan, are they different and are they bankrupt “NO”.
All the other stuff you’ve mentioned isn’t worth my time responding too.
Apart from the fact that if the US pulled all the money it’s owed from nations around the world its debts that people keep talking about are easily manageable.
Those other countries how ever wouldn’t be in such a good state.
Reddit is full of people who listen to max Kaiser and use YouTube to get their economic education, all of which is complete bullshit of course, and conspiracy theory politics.
And bitcoin being so minute is no global currency in the making, it has more flaws than a mud diamond, it’s the most preposterous thing you could ever put forward.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:30:09
You see young man, here is a classic example of a crypto with backing and less volatility, it’s also very fast, BTC will die soon and be taken over by stronger powers.
Enjoy the read.
Also on reddit there is a post showing how bad adoption really is based on new wallets, and it’s pathetic, I did tell you all this earlier but you refuse to believe the truth.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:27:57
You are completely wrong, the person made a valid comment, simple as that.
I should grow up haha, spam accounts �� I’ll reply or post anything I like within the rules of this site.
And so shall others, it has nothing to do with you, simple as.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:18:13
You see here is an example of a better system than bitcoin and faster, BTC will die eventually, over taken by something that works but without Bitcoins volatility.
Enjoy 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:50:26
It’s a fiasco, nakamoto will be clad they turned their backs on BTC,  nothing more now than a cesspit of short sellers, futures contracts and centralised exchanges.
Oh and dumb people pumping more money into it, feeding the rich at the top of the tree, sighting their reasons as one day it will be better ����‍♂️.
Stay clear of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:51:18
What do you mean.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:38:15
You should see whats circulating around social media platforms about fake bitcoins, probably no one on earths going to touch one after this shit storms played out ��.
Beware fake Bitcoins.

Here this may help you know now exactly who likes BTC and who doesn’t.
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:58:41
*Bitcoins not ready*, it’s funny how you constantly hear that term on reddit or when BTC is discussed, yet they declare it works and has worked from day one.
No, No, No it’s doesn’t and hasn’t, glad you agree.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:52:06
CME, CBOE, MINERS SHORTING, facts not fiction the BTC price will not recover due to this manipulation, one is screwing the other buy bringing the price down.
Expect stagnant or falling prices for years to come.
If anyone wants evidence of this manipulation it’s freely accessible on a quick google search.
Fractional reserve Bitcoins have landed.
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:26:38
Coinbase is what props up BTC, and it’s probably the easiest less hassle option for new investors, all the others are more complicated and less regulated.
You want adoption well I’m afraid centralised governed exchanges are it.
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:16:56
Mr mr, you should also understand fractional reserves function before you call me stupid ��, this may help with that education.
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:35:08
It’s regulated period, and bitcoin does as its told SIMPLE.
There is a social media campaign starting soon, alerting the public to the fake Bitcoins being produces via CME and CBOE futures contacts, this needs to be out there.
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:58:21
Yes of course it can die if it’s price goes low enough, Bitcoin is based on “belief”if that belief goes as the price declines, miners shut up shop, and the mass sell of begins.
It’s not hard to envisage, most businesses that run out of money end up in that situation.
Why is bitcoin different.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:13:22
How do you know who I really am?
Bitcoin won’t seep into every financial market, you may not have noticed but it’s  slowly I’m imploding due to the greed in this sector.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:35:39
It’s still a compromise on decentralisation, and you agree that, that is what I was saying.
And also they don’t know yet whether those hubs will work to that effect, only time will tell that, and only time will tell many other things about LN, especially its security.
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:57:55
Absolute crap, look at the price, why can’t these lies stop.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:50:01
That’s the problem for me, you see so many on reddit drive home the decentralised argument, and they say BTC worked from day on.
I’ve never believed that and I can’t see how centralisation works with a anarchistic product like BTC.
As for LN speed, that’s clear it’s fast, super fast.
And the fees are low also.
But I know all things are hackable, they appear not to be until someone manages to steel funds, so whether LN is or isn’t will be proven in time.
Mind you, you have pointed out a potential problem there with digital money, if BTCs vulnerability had been taken advantage of, I’m afraid that would be the end of it.
This is why claiming BTC to take over all aspects of finance is crazy as one hack or vulnerability in that kind of adoption “MASS” could kill an economy.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:21:39
Hahahahaha, please go away you’ve not got a clue, increased money velocity causes increased inflation.
Would you like a link so you can learn about it?
The BTC cap of 21 million idiot doesn’t have to change, the CME and CBOE are inflating the BTC supply every day, credit cards would have the same effect on the price, because you’ll be spending what you don’t  own, hahahahaha that’s why they call it “CREDIT”, and not DEBIT.
Fractional reserve is already in the BTC space, what do you think futures are, those contracts aren’t BTC settled, they’re cash settled to subdue the BTC price, but the contracts are sold as BTC this inflated the BTC supply without even touching BTC on the Blockchain.
So credit cards will cause BTC inflation and they will also lower the price, good luck getting people to pay up when they default.
And may I add, if you are directly producing a credit card for the bitcoin ecosystem it will cause those effects to that system, not to the tradition economy, either way we all know where credit ends.
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:18:03
That’s not exactly true, otherwise no mining pools would cease mining, and cease mining they are.
Also only two mining rigs are now profitable for mining.
And although mining difficulty adjusts down, so does hash-rate, which means in simple terms a less secure Blockchain.
Thinking you can go back to basic graphics cards and have system security is bollocks, as you can’t.
And as the BTC price gets lower and lower and miners can’t find cheaper electric that’s exactly what will happen.
Thinking mining is full proof is a lie.
This system is far easy to attack with low hash-rate than before because now everyone know about it, in the early day not many new and it had little value.
Any hackers would be lining up to say they brought down bitcoin.
