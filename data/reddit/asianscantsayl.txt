Bitcoin evangelists are mentally handicapped.  You entirely miss the point of what hes saying. The government can get control of your bitcoin, not through technology but through you. If I come to your house and start cutting off fingers how long will it take you to give up your private keys?  Your bitcoin is only as safe from others as you are wiling to die for it.

How can crypto solve income inequality?  Bitcoin can only be an "income" while the speculative asset is under adopted, once it hits mainstream adoption the price will stabilize and no longer produce long term value to people to the point that it sizably increases wealth. 
As for it being a solution to our debt economy....are these people mentally handicapped. The debt economy runs on IOUs, that will not stop even if bitcoin becomes the sole currency on the planet.  Holy fuck this is young earth creationist levels of science.

Your whole arguement is missing rhe entire point and ia irrelevent. 
Everyone is aware bitcoin has yet to be cracked. Im a  progranmer by trade, I am well aware of how bitcoin works. The fact that no one can crack your coin is irrelevant if the government can figure out who you are come to your house and coerce you until you give it up. 
Unless you are capable of fighting the us military in a long term sustained conflict and control territory you cannot protect your bitcoin because you cannot protect yourself if the government wants to kidnap you

The CIA commits evil in the belief it strengthens the country google commits evil to increase profits . Ergo when the CIA sold coke to fund the anti communists in Latin America it was to stop the spread of communsim not enrich the share holders.

I have yet to see any evidence in all of world history that a deflationary currency doesnt lead to economic slow downs due to horde of the currency being more profitable than investment. In the case of Venezuela deflation of bitcoin would be more profitible than working. Has anyone here even studied economics? This is econ 101. Bitcoin incentivizes you to hold onto it and do nothing with it while fiat encourages grand investment. Obviously high inflation is bad, I believe the ideal is to be as close to 0 inflation as possible, ex gold backed currency. Can someone site a single example of  a society based in deflationary currencies(gold isnt, its value is stable through out history) beating an inflationary or near 0 ( gold based) economy.

You dont underatand. Bitcoin does not hold a monopoly on decentralization. Key words UNTIL NOW. The scenario OP talked about was 18 years in the future. 18 years from now bitcoin might lose its decentralization, it may be inefficient and expensive to make transactions who knows. The idea that the first technology is the absolutely best has been proving wrong alll through out history.
Many big proponents of bitcoin acknowledge this. This isnt a radicial idea in the bitcoin sphere. It is very likely one day that another crypto currency will out perform bitcoin leading to an exodus.
Right now there are billions to be made in dethroning bitcoin, if you can create an alt to rival BTC you will literally become a billionare over night. This is a very strong incentive and I think its foolish to discount innovation.

Anyone can create a new system the issue is getting the ENTIRE WORLD to use it before they are destroyed by the full wrath of the US government. If you believe America invaded iraq to protect the petro dollar what do you think will be done if someone attempts to subvert us control of the financial system. America would quite literally declare war over its financial hegemony. Its retarded. Im willing to start a kick starter to send active posters on this sub to community college to take econ 101
As it stands the american financial institutions can stop transactions between 2 third party countries at will, and they have before. Anyone trying to even partially switch will have all transactions stopped in their country causing financial collapse.

The petro dollar isnt big enough to control the price of the dollar. America may replace foreign governments who become hostile to it but the amount of USD moved in oil pales in comparison to all global transactions. Maybe 1%. Gadadis portion no where near that percent. 
This is an easily disprovable in theory. USD is the reserve currency for all nations. The international financial system that hands all transactions is quite literally handled by the US government. Lybis dropping all dollar use tomorrow wouldnt hurt the dollar. 
Further bitcoin does not have the security of the financial industry, the government could crack down on bitcoin arresting anyone in possession of it making it unlikely any legitimate companies would use it relegating it to at most small p2p dealings that the general public wont use . People can easily track down bitcoin users, the silk road.

You cant measure inflation of a currency by looking at 100 year period. No one is actually affected by that. I guarentee you maybe 3% of this sub was wealthy prior to bitcoin and none of them stock pile cash. At most people keep 5-10% and the rest are in assets that are unaffected by inflation. You dont understand economics at even a basic level. I keep more in literal gold as a safety net than  fiat.

First of all most people dont hold much cash at all. Donald trump had to sell off assets to get cash for his campaign. No one holds dollars. So if you have a billion dollar net worth 900 million is tied in properties, the stock market and whatever else so only 10% of your portfolio is actually affected by inflation and a nominal amount at that since its only like 3% a year. Year to year people are barely affected by inflation especially consider wages rise with inflation.
When people say store of value it largely means when I go to sell you something for a dollar that dollar will stay the same until I would reasonable do something else with it, such as purchase more assets

Bitcoin cannot replace banks until bitcoin reaches  volatility under 5% yearly. Potentially this could happen in  a decade or so but I wouldn't count on it in the near future
The biggest thing is when bitcoin settles down and reaches say 5% volatility even if its purely upwards then as an asset it has half of the returns of an index fund. Which would drive away all of the speculators propping up price.
Stability inherently increases use and kills price at the same time, potentially leading to less use and price ultimately. If bitcoin was accepted as a global currency due to price stabilization then there would   no reason to horde it leading to massive sell off and price plummeting to reasonable levels.
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:23:19
I believe its 3% although ill accept 4. The thing is fiat is predictable if you assume average inflation you can reasonable predict what the dollar is worth in a year and make contracts tied to that.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to do this with crypto without tying it to the dollar

Lets assume the people of Venezuela adopt bitcoin univeraally tomorrow. Then lets look at bitcoins growth by year.  Bitcoins are worth 10x what they were a year ago. If you were to believe bitcoin is to keep growing in value at even 1/5 its prior rate then there is no investment you could reasonably outpace it. The most finacially sound thing to do in this situation is to hold bitcoin instead of invest it into other aspects of the economy. 
If you paid attention to what I said near 0 inflation.  A slight amount of deflation is fine as is a slight amount of inflation. If you believe your currency could be worth 5x in a year you would spend as little or it is possible. Relativity is important, both USD and bolivar are inflationary but one at 1000x the rate of the other. Inflation encourages spending high inflation encourages abandonment.   Deflation needs to be far below regular returns from other market assets as to not make the logical chocie to "HODL".
You realize this subreddit is home to the hodl term right? The hodl concept is detrimental to economic growth and only work in deflationary currencies.
If bitcoin gaines in value at 1% a year it would be an acceptable deflationary currency but when that happens all speculators will immediately sell off crashing the price. If that doesnt happen then bitcoin would replace fiat.
Also a side note I own bitcoin and lite coin and have for a good 4 years. I like bitcoin, I like what it does I own it I trade it. I just dont believe in pushing unfounded optimism.
