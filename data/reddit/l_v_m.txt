So much for thinking different.   
Wonder what Woz made of this censorship.

*sigh*   
Its a shame to see someone drop the certification bomb in this day and age, seeing as from Andreas talks, public posts, podcasts etc. the cat has demonstrated a firm understanding of the topology, and has provided a number of solutions for Bitcoin 2.0.   
As for all this core dev talk, its real petty, seeing as all devs which make up our open community should be treated equally, instead of this holier than thou crap.   
Now with that said, if you must see his creds (to prove his "worthiness") may I suggest a LinkedIn query.

frankly, its unhealthy for your psyche to be locked in one state, and one state only.   
sprinkle some humor on top of that srs biznis and enjoy the best of both worlds.

it is really that hard to fathom the giving nature of doge, as we continue to go through one economic train wreck after another?   
shibes just like to share, and aren't focused on the large profit margin as much as the hoarders of bitcoin appear to be.    
in essence, this has worked in doges favor as free pr in gaining further awareness on cryptos in general ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

lulz, you neckbeards are hilarious.   
if andreas wasn't appropriate for this position, do you really think tim would have allowed him to follow through?   
as for the title, i agree - "mastering the protocol" (even though bitcoin technically as a whole is more than just a single protocol...) is misleading and somewhat slightly arrogant for my liking.

Don't be afraid of competition.   
Its a necessity for Bitcoins evolvement.   
As long as the businesses are given the facts from the filler, I guarantee this won't happen :)

Amazon accept payments via Zincsave with Bitcoins.   
Sadly AWS does not :(

Touche.   
Some are just clones, then some others go the extra mile, and shouldn't even be considered as alts, as they offer much more i.e. Vert, Dark, and Myriad.   
As for your analogy, I don't think the physical can be compared to the digital with all alts.   
This is partly due to the aesthetics themselves, seeing as some are scarce, offer fresh features, fix old flaws, use forward thinking algos, whilst others are copy and paste jobs, support QE, and don't offer anything new.
