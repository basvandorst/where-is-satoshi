You're poisonous, I bet your old account is Goldberg something.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:02:04
Yes, what is the general opinion after todays expiration? Has whales been trying to dump the price due to this future?
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:43:50
We touched the bottom, welcome back up hodlers.
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:42:39
You're not analyzing nothing, you're purely spreading FUD and you been doing it for weeks. Your posts are crap and you probably forget to buy when BTC was low hence why you talk it down so much. My honest opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:08:50
Looks nice, will def hodl now
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:45:59
Sad but I think might be true........ Why does people FUD just for the sake of FUD.. the Google thing isn't major lol.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:09:08
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:50:57
Reason why pumping:
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:31:31
Was posted yesterday and that's not a FUD article, on the contrary it's a strong bullish signal
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:41:18
Just entered my e-mail. Looking forward to it.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:35:47
Crazy day indeed
@_date: 2018-03-21 07:27:56
Che cavolo?! There's not a single bank in Sweden that would do that, if they would it would be a hugh riot. Can't believe they're allowed to do that
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:12:01
Have you seen the serie "Suits"? That's how I'm thinking a whale company look like
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:57:59
You know what they say two flags makes zero flags.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:07:19
I dont understand the people selling at 8.9-9k range, it's still so cheap and as soon if/as we go back to 8.5 we're gonna pump up so why risk it?!
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:07:05
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:30:43
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:10:32
Yep I just fully invested again an hour ago, glad I did.
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:02:52
lol, no? That's from March 16 and it's not even bad news. Guy above just tries to start FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:34:14
lmao, yoy wish.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:58:53
Did you forget to buy in? lmao
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:00:47
NEW money he said. The money on buy orders are money already in the system.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:47:06
Sad but true I think, atleast for 24 hours or so
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:01:53
I just bought the whole dip lol
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:00:34
They all dumped their coins looking for a good re enter point for sure
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:33:53
What? The child porn thing was a news article back from 2012 or something. Do you know how much child porn is distrubuted with FIAT? Sell all FIAT!
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:00:15
We're buying the dip, you can thank Europe later
@_date: 2018-03-21 07:37:17
Coinbase app has that function. Not using it because it was working v poorly before. I use Bitstamp, they send you a SMS which is really nice and works perfectly fine.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:11:21
What is this shaize? CRAP.
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:24:39

Following but not sure what i'm seeing, care to explain?
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:11:42
Thanks for the idea, just read those dailys and they're exactly the same as now.. don't be fooled by people saying it'll reach 1k..
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:50:48
I did the same, but now I just bought back. Should've dipped already if we were going down, I think/hope next is a pump. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:45:47
I'd actually be willing to pay for this. Just wanted to register but noticed you have to enter CC details but not going to happen til I atleast tried it out a few times. You should have a free trial, or lower the price. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:18:46
lmao, I suppose you just bought in, you big fat troll
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:43:30
Happy to say we touched the bottom 2 days ago, I don't see us going down any time soon tbh
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:07:42
Did you ever regret taking a dump? There's your answer.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:04:25
That's a good thing.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:37:15
or 12k
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:35:00
Could someone ban Goldbergger from here please? Never seen a guy spreading so much FUD and talking bs.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:29:14
Woop woop!
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:56:18
Gotcha! Still need to enter CC info though?
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:45:52
So how does it actually work, I've entered my e-mail. No confirmation yet
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:25:56
Guess a big dump is comin lol
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:13:55
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:06:51
Angry for not buying in at 7.7?:D 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:07:13
Are we going lower than 1 April dip?
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:44:25
What happened to BTC daily price discussion? Doesn't show up on this subred anymore..
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:27:34
Does anyone, even whales, know what's going on with the price last couple of months? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:19:24
Selling and re-buying at lower price
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:22:02
He's fully invested isn't he? Makes sense he would say smth like that.
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:46:07
What makes you say they have 3 months to stop crypto?
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:26:10
Hello Goldberger go eat crap again
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:14:15
