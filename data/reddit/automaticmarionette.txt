In 2010 you had to use the command line to send a bitcoin transaction, and a blog post or video trying to explain it left anyone outside the fields of distributed networks and cryptography thinking "this is so complicated".
In a year or two you will be able to use lightning without thinking about the tech at all. In the meantime, Bitcoin transactions cost a couple of pennies. No one in their right mind will sacrifice the security of their funds to save a penny or two on transaction fees by using Bcash.

Schnorr is being actively developed, but it's a major change to bitcoin that will take another few years to implement.

The Blockstream meme needs to die. They have a single core developer, Pieter Wuille. Most of the main developers are independent, and some work for different companies like Chaincode Labs. Bitcoin development is decentralised, unlike Ethereum development.

* Bitcoin's energy consumption is not outrageous, it's necessary to secure a global network.
* Bitcoin's energy consumption subsidises renewable energy as renewable is often the most cost-effective way to mine.
* Bitcoin miners make use of excess energy production capacity that goes otherwise unused.
* Respectfully, we are not here to save the planet, but to rebuild the monetary system.

Even the Iota Foundation admits that Iota is not currently decentralised. If you make that claim then you're misleading (another word might be scamming) potential investors.


IIRC that PoW already takes a few seconds. If the network ever has to deal with a really large amount of transactions, how long will the PoW take? At this point BTC payment channels are already superior to DAG currencies for micropayments.

Completely disagree. Hashrate has been consistently exponential and continues to rise on BTC despite massive falls in price. ETH and Monero also \*had\* consistently rising hashrates.
There has to be another force causing Monero's hashrate to drop. It seems odd that they would be mining ETH instead, considering Ethereum's hashrate is stagnant.

@_date: 2018-06-25 03:50:08
The basic game theory of Bitcoin is that it's always more profitable to behave honestly than to behave maliciously.
If Bitmain were to use their hash rate to censor transactions, or even to try double-spending coins, then as soon as the market realises, the USD price of BTC will tank. I would personally move all of my BTC either to LTC or fiat.
If that happened, Bitmain loses the massive upfront investment they've made on SHA256 ASICS, because they would need to switch to a much lower value coin in order to get a return.
Therefore it's in Bitmain's best interests that Bitcoin's network remains healthy.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:30:52


This is a bit of an empty statement. You can have your bitcoin stolen from your non\-lightning node if the private keys are exposed. The difference with lightning is that private keys are always online, so if you are able to secure them then you are fine. There's nothing about lightning transactions in particular that are less secure. At the end of the day, an attacker needs to gain access to your private keys to steal your BTC.

@_date: 2018-06-21 22:06:38
No I don't believe so. Last I checked Bitcoin Core won't create a transaction with a fee lower than 1 sat\_per\_byte. Anyway, I think the node software itself won't propagate transactions with fees lower than 1 sat/byte, so no, it's pretty unlikely you'd ever get a transaction with a 1 sat fee into a block.
You have to remember that there is a small cost just for downloading your transaction and verifying the signature. At 1 sat it probably makes more economic sense to just ignore it and have a non-full block than pull in your 1 sat fee.
150 sats = 1 penny US, so yeah... It ain't gonna get much cheaper than that.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:09:11
The explanation was in one word: centralised. The reason being centralised makes them shitcoins is that they are not truly censorship resistant like BTC, LTC and XMR. There's no point in crypto if powerful people can just decide to shut you down. That's literally what happened to Paypal.

@_date: 2018-06-25 03:45:05
And [Monero's hashrate]( tanked after that and continues to fall slowly, which is unprecedented in its history or BTC's (hashrate pretty much always rises).
That means they made the upfront cost of a 51&amp; attack on their network much, much cheaper.
Besides, it only kicks the can down the road. Eventually we are going to need a competitive mining market. We aren't going to get consensus to switch PoW algorithms repeatedly, if ever.

This is the guide I used. It's pretty detailed but is intended for a headless linux setup.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:42:52
Yeah, sort of. The bitcoin never leaves the blockchain, it's just locked up in a timelocked contract that is set to pay itself back to the channel opener by default. When either party wants to end the payment channel arrangement, they can broadcast the latest state of the channel to the network, signalling the original timelocked contract to pay out the final balance, with agreement from both parties.
There's no money being created out of thin air. The lightning transactions are real, signed BTC transactions. The beauty of Lightning is that instead of broadcasting those transactions to the entire world (bad for privacy, not scalable), you unicast them to the next node (or recipient in the most simple case).
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:52:11
IIRC he said it took him roughly a year to code up a first working version, without telling anyone else.
He then went to the cryptography mailing list and said "I've made this thing, here's the white paper. Have a read. I'll release the code and start the network in a few weeks".
That's what you call an "immaculate conception" in crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:42:53
Because if there are no fees it's trivial to spam the network. A fee market ensures actual economic activity is occurring because spam attacks are incredibly expensive.

Yes the memory pool would fill, but what do you gain from that? Anyone who pays 1.5 Sat/B or higher will get their transactions prioritised. That's not exactly expensive, just a couple of cents.
As I said, if you actually want to push people out of blocks you're going to have to spend a lot more than that, at which point the length of time you can sustain the attack will be lower.
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:06:52
I don't live in the US, but assuming you do, you have access to cheaper hardware than I do :). If you can, get an external drive with its own power source. Also you don't really need 1TB - the blockchain is less than 200GB, so even 500GB should last you a long time.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:31:23
First off, 500,000 transactions is only two and a half days of btc transactions. Secondly, the price per transaction would increase as you pumped money into it, because some people will be willing to pay more than $5 to get their transaction onto the blockchain. We have seen avg transaction fees of over $20. So a sustained attack on the network would need to spend at least $20 per transaction to run it for a long period. If there are 200,000 transactions a day, that's $4 million a day to block almost all other transactions from getting on the blockchain.
Personally I think the fee would rise much higher than $20, so it would likely cost more.

Not all criticisms of bitcoin are invalid, but many are. You are appealing to authority regarding Bill Gates. He is an expert entrepreneur and software engineer.

@_date: 2018-03-05 23:14:07
Unless the attacker actually gets transactions into a block (thus preventing others from getting theirs in), they aren't doing much.
These days 1 sat/B could get you into the next block, but most people are overpaying. There are many transactions with 300+ sats/B, which indicates that an attacker would need to spend a lot more than 1 sat/B per spam transaction to mess with the network.

This is what I don't get about the feeless DAG currencies. If transacting is free, why can't an attacker write a trivial script to bounce coins around different addresses to overload the network?
The answer for IOTA is that there is a small amount of PoW that needs to be done for each transaction, but if that's the case, it's not really feeless, the fee is just extrinsic to the system, i.e. your electricity bill.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:40:52


What you're saying is wrong. There are many, many members of this subreddit who discuss technical developments in bitcoin that Bill Gates has no idea about.

@_date: 2018-03-06 23:18:35
Basic computer science in no way prepares you for crypto, I'm sorry that's just false. There are mathematic and economic implications of cryptocurrency that go far beyond computer science. Bill Gates is not an expert on those things.
What he said about fentanyl is bullshit. What OS do most people buying drugs use? Windows. Does Windows facilitate buying fentanyl? Yes. Does the internet facilitate buying fentanyl? Yes. Does monero facilitate buying fentanyl? Yes. The point is that sometimes people use tech for things you don't want them to. Imagine if Bill had caved in that the internet was just for criminals in the 90s. I'm sorry, what utter horseshit.
By the way, some of us don't mind people using their own money to buy things they want. I would rather see an end to the war on drugs and medical help for fentanyl addicts.

So it's kind of like the spam protection email uses. The question is will 1 second (for example) worth of PoW per transaction be enough to secure the network, especially with the fact that iota will not reach a secure number of transactions for a few years at least.

Satoshi wrote with British English spelling. It seems a little unlikely to me that Nick Szabo or Hal Finney would put that much trouble into adjusting their spelling across the hundreds of emails and posts on bitcointalk.
Also according to Gavin Andreesen, Satoshi was an incredible programmer but relatively naive when it comes to cryptography (at least compared to experts), thus making it even less likely that he was Hal or Nick.

is by no means the only platform for discussion on bitcoin, and even given the heavy-handedness of the moderators on this subreddit, people still discuss on and off-chain scaling here constantly without reprisal. When the controversy over censorship started, this was virtually the only subreddit where cryptocurrency was actively discussed. Now there are dozens of active subs. Bitcointalk is arguably a more important community anyway. But even then, the market is the ultimate judge. People do not put millions of dollars into crap. The market has spoken and BTC was chosen, not BCH. Just like ETH was chosen over ETC, even though ETH was the fork. The reason the market chose BTC and ETH was not social engineering, but a rational examination of the facts - BTC and ETH have better developers.


This is just the nature of reddit. Compare and As an aside, both Gavin and especially Mike have lost massive amounts of credibility over the past few years, with Gavin endorsing BCH and falling for Craig Wright's claims to being Satoshi, and Mike Hearn chilidishly noping-out when things became controversial. Could you tell me what very good ideas they had that have been ignored by Core? (As a caveat, I recognise Gavin's crucial contribution to bitcoin's codebase)


You believe in on-chain scaling or off-chain?


Yes you're right that claim is incorrect.


In my experience people do things mostly for money. If blockstream is not profiting off of in some way damaging bitcoin, I do not see why they would pour thousands of hours into it. If you still believe they have malicious intent but don't know why, I don't know what to say.


Look at the github. Look at the progress on the lightning network. If blockstream is trying to slow bitcoin development, they're clearly going about it the wrong way.


Sure they are, but they're also clearly ideologically motivated as well. **Blockstream is paying developers to improve bitcoin**. Without that, how do you think the devs put food on the table? Other coins have a built-in percentage of the block reward going to the devs - bitcoin does not. And before you say I'm contradicting myself and that they are ideologically motivated to destroy bitcoin, I would ask for evidence. Quite apart from the fact that since anyone can create a cryptocurrency (they are not scarce) destroying bitcoin out of ideology would be completely futile.


How do they hinder the development of other clients? If you want to develop a client, what is stopping you? I personally think the reason bitcoin clients are centralised on core is that it is peerless. It has the best developers and the most thorough testing. Unless you can compete with their expertise, experience and infrastructure I will not consider for a second running your client on my node.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:49:37

As you said, at the moment. The technology to make it more private already exists in various forms, and some even that not only don't increase the size of the blockchain, but drastically decrease it (Mimblewimble).
The trouble is thoroughly testing and then introducing such drastic changes on a network as large as bitcoin's is no mean feat. It will be achieved though, and if bitcoin fails, another crypto will achieve it.

@_date: 2018-03-05 06:01:34


The fee market would still exist even if there was no block size limit. The miners are not incentivised to include transactions in a block if there is no fee, and since they don't have to, a fee market naturally develops. See BCH as an example - the blocks aren't close to full, yet you still pay transaction fees.


I don't buy this. The only way to exploit the market is to spend real money to push the fees up. Any fee that is paid has been paid voluntarily by a user who has decided getting their transaction in the blockchain is worth the fee. If you are moving thousands of dollars then a couple dollars for a fee seems totally reasonable. Less so if you're buying lunch. The point is that the fee market discourages spam transactions. I've yet to see how DAG currencies can effectively do that, if the cost of transacting is so low.

It's not that spending bitcoin will turn it into bad money. It's that spending bitcoin is an irrational economic decision when you have fiat to spend.
The analogy is real gold coins vs. fiat coins.
Why would you go to the market and give away your gold coins if fiat will do just as well but is actually "worth less" to you?
Let's put it another way: I was considering using my BTC to buy a laptop. After a little thought, I realised what a terrible economic decision that would be. I have the fiat (bad money) to buy the laptop, so I'm going to use it instead.
Bitcoin won't be used for payments en masse until fiat has lost all or most of its value.

IOTA for example is currently centralised, so I'm sure they can deal with the attack. The next one I can think of is NANO. Since NANO requires an SSD and IPv6 to run a node (and therefore transact), I ain't in a position to do that. Coincidentally, I am also not in a position to support the network, which seems odd for a decentralised cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:12:03
You're not going to get paid. There are only a handful of active applications and for most users, we already have a low fee path to the recipient, so chances are your node will see a few forwarded payments every now and then, just like every one else's.

Spending bitcoin is not only a bad economic decision on your part, it also won't accelerate its adoption at all.
In aggregate, humans will make the rational economic decision to spend their bad money first (fiat) over their bitcoin. Any attempt to go against that goes against millenia of observed human behaviour.

Of the four main contributors since 2014 (Wladimir van der Laan, Matt Corallo, Peter Wuille and John Newberry, only two of them work for blockstream. And even if you think blockstream controls the development of bitcoin core, what do you think their aim is? To halt development of bitcoin?

1. Lightning will not be the only payments network on Bitcoin. People will build centralised solutions like Paypal for transferring Bitcoin - and that's OK, as long as you have the option.
2. Bitcoin is not trying to replace Visa. The true visionary goal of Bitcoin is to be better money that fiat. If fiat and Bitcoin are co-existing, I will always spend my fiat first because I value it less.
3. Your assumptions seem naive given the extremely early stages we are in for BOTH Bitcoin and Lightning Network. "It's a marathon, not a sprint", as Elizabeth Stark always reminds us. Be prepared to wait decades for a fully globally functional Bitcoin.

Luke, my concern with a change in PoW is that Bitmain will reach an even higher level of control over the hashrate with any change in PoW, due to their obviously massive capital and plant advantage.
I still haven't seen a good argument as to 1) why Bitmain would be disintermediated by a PoW change and 2) why the same forces that led us to the current situation wouldn't apply to a different hashing algorithm (leaving aside this OPoW which I don't yet fully understand).

There are other ways to think about this.
When you buy something with USD or BTC, what you're saying is "I value what you're about to give me more than my USD or BTC".

They have correctly implemented segwit, so you can search bech32 addresses and the fee size on transactions is shown correctly.
Also unlike blockchain.info and blocktrail.com (bought by bitmain), they're not pushing bullshit forks of bitcoin.
They also have charts, although not quite as many as blockchain.info.

Apples to oranges. Segwit and legacy are both ways of transferring Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is an entirely different, centralised, lower value network.
I don't want the developers to have the power to hard fork at a whim. I don't want large blocks because they are a bad idea. Therefore I don't care if BCH has lower fees, I will NEVER keep my wealth in it.

I understand the AsicBoost exploit was a major cause for concern, but hasn't segwit levelled the playing field, in that everyone can/is using it now?


Continually requiring the community to reach consensus on something so controversial surely can't be sustainable? I am not an anti-hardforker per se, but I do think eventually (maybe decades into the future) they will no longer be possible/desirable. If that's the case, we need to get this right once and for all.
