I bought for under $100 then sold in November 2013 and repurchased as it started falling... all the way down... :/
I would definitely rebalance if things started to get crazy.  I wouldn't feel comfortable with tens of thousands in btc.  (1% is around $3k for me )

like Paul Graham?
A quote derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer


would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the
initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute.
Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a
brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a
nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows
how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the
inconvenience of signing an NDA." -

the idea is "maybe light and energy are related". e=mc^2 and all of the research and mathematics behind it is the implementation and execution distilled down into a simplified form.  my goodness you're dense.

well now is a great opportunity for people to stop being so stupid and learn how decimals work.... or we can just coddle the stupid masses to ease them of their money... that's a real noble approach.

@_date: 2015-04-02 15:16:45
okay so you had 1e-5 and 1e-6 BTC... how is that not user friendly? 
edit: we already have ways to discuss these numbers efficiently. why are we inventing new units arbitrarily?

I'm referring to the people who think buying a $20 stock is more affordable than a $200 stock because they can buy more of it, without taking into account any of the other metrics.
What does this have to do with buy high sell low?
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:41:14


Cool strawman.  The base unit of currency is 1 dollar, not $100.  
There is nothing wrong with saying 5 cents (centi-dollar), as that means 5 hundredths of one dollar.  Just as there would be nothing wrong with saying 5 cBTC for 0.05 BTC or 5μBTC for 0.000005 BTC.

I'd stop using the service if there were no way to display it in standard btc &lt;-&gt; USD form.

it was a letter someone here put together and tried sending out to news organizations back in 2013 when the price jumped the first time.
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:41:00
well this was the first time the price spiked over $100, which is what the letter was about.  but yes, many more spikes prior to that.
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:39:24
Why do you think it's any easier to understand what bits are?  You're just hoping that the average person takes it at face value and doesn't try to understand the currency they're using?  You sound like the morons who won't buy a stock because "the share price is too high"

I was a supermarket clerk at 16 and I learned this stuff at like 10 or 11.  I was that non-idiot who could give proper change after the drawer opened and the customer decided to give an extra $0.31 to get better change.

I was taught by the american education system.  I routinely mask and shift a stream of bits and convert them to either ieee754 double precision decimals or fixed point decimals.  I multiply 4 digit numbers by 4 digit numbers in my head for fun at parties. don't blame the education system for stupid and lazy people unwilling to click Wikipedia for things they don't understand.... and don't take away my option to view the exchange rate per BTC.

If you would have just read and understood what I originally wrote many comments up in this tree you'd have come to that conclusion long ago.


Also, it's, "you're"

why the gimmicks? just use BTC

Another great strawman from someone who has problems with reading comprehension.  I was talking about $200 to $20.  People who spend at least $1000 in the market at a time are not going to have any problems with a $200 stock.  They will buy 5 of them compared to the person buying 50 of the $20 stock.  The number of shares possessed is MEANINGLESS.  It says nothing about the market cap, earnings per share, or potential for growth/loss.  
In the case of BRK-A you need to have enough to buy at least one, but thankfully we're talking about bitcoin and you can buy fractions.  My point is that people see $250 for 1BTC as being too expensive, but see $0.25 for 1000 bits (or whatever the fuck this proposal is) as cheap/affordable.  Meanwhile they are the same damn thing with some shifted decimal points.  Those people, like you, are quite stupid.

I once had $66,000 frozen in a savings account because I didn't make a transaction in 12 months.  I had to physically come into the branch and sign something.  I was living out of state at the time and there was nothing they could do in the meantime if I wanted the money.  I withdrew it all that day I came back.

This is surprising, coinbase is just another bank playing to the whims of the govt
