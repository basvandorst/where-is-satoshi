this is the next coin that seems to be getting pumped for no good reason.. thats what happens when alot of money comes into crypto but bitcoin isn't enough profit for people for the moment.

I've been using QuadrigaCX since January. It has always been a good experience. I've both sent them over $15,000 CDN in various methods, and received over $30,000 back into my bank account with various methods as well. The fees to withdraw are reasonable, each method has a slightly different rate. 2.5% for Regular bank transfers.
Transferring from a cryptocurrency into dollars is 0.5%.

It's called Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, and yes he was 12 hours into it.

I totally understand what you guys are saying, but part of our goal is to get investors of all variety, including non-investors. There is already a lot feedback from non-investors who take the quiz saying they cant respond because they don't invest. But the idea is we want to get everyone's responses about how they would invest if they were to invest. Asking specific details about net work/income/etc wouldn't help us.

Yeah it's true, I just turned 30 so I'm right on the edge of that myself. You could always just click the 30-39 group :)

Lol, another oversight on our part. That would have probably been a common response.

Each result we gather gets a rating for Tech Savviness and Risk Tolerance by computing some metrics for the questions. While those suggestions could be included, it would only make the ratings slightly more accurate. We wanted to avoid asking to much about peoples personal finance to increase our chances of getting a wide range of responses.

The survey would probably give you a high risk tolerance score :)
