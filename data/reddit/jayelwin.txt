My god... Buy a new computer. Take 150 square feet of fine mesh chain link fence. Build a giant cube. Go get a whole lot of MREs and bottled water. Enter the cube and live in there for three days. Turn on the computer. Generate a wallet and key. Turn off the computer. Travel to an electronics surplus flea market. Buy a 1983 model dot matrix printer. Hook it up to the computer but be sure you're back in the chain link mesh box first. Print out three copies of your key. Fold one copy up and place it under your tongue. Mail the second copy of the key to your uncle Phil in Albuquerque. Tell him to write the key on the wall in the basement. Then have him paint over the key with blue metallic paint. Buy a sheet of 1/64" thick stainless steel. Buy a hammer and chisel. Learn cuneiform. Bang the chisel with the hammer in cuneiform patterns corresponding to the translation of your key into the stainless steel sheet. Pour some fresh concrete into 6 large flower pots. Cut the cuneiform imprinted stainless steel sheets into 6 pieces. Press the steel down into the concrete drying in the large flower pots. Mail two of the flower pots to your uncle in Albuquerque. Put one of the pots in the men's room on the Staten Island ferry. Drop the other three under the Verrazano bridge. Fly to Albuquerque. Burn your uncle's house down. Now when you want to spend any of those bitcoins all you have to do is hop on the Staten Island ferry and go use the men's room, then using scuba gear jump off the  boat when it's under the Verrazano bridge, swim down to the bottom, and look at the three flower pots there. Simple.
Man I think these bitcoins are really going to go mainstream soon.

No, it will make more and more people less interested in bitcoin as it cannot fulfill what it was originally intended. Thus the demand will go down and the price will too. People who bought high will not want to compound their losses as the price falls so they too will sell (and not trigger a capital gain) furthering the downward pressure.

The top two uses are the main reason why it's expensive. And they're the "wealth" reasons.

This is silly nitpicking of the semantics of the word. Food absolutely has intrinsic value. I buy food to eat, not because I think of what it will be worth in the future. I buy gas for my car because it gets me places. I buy oil because it heats my home. Many things have plenty of intrinsic value. 
The only reason anyone would buy bitcoins is because they believe someone will give them something of equal or greater value than their acquisition cost in the future. If you had knowledge that in the future people would not give you what you paid for your bitcoins you would never have bought them. They have absolutely no intrinsic value at all. 
I think bitcoins are at the mercy of the next large holder who wants to cash out. Any more downward pressure and I think there could be a race to the exits.

You are totally incorrect about commodities only being taxed when converting to dollars. Any time you exchange something of value for something else of value you have a potential tax. And saying no dollars = no commerce is equally as false. 
Just because bitcoins work in your anarchist libertarian dystopia doesn't mean that world is any closer to being a reality.

If gold were only valuable for its industrial purposes it would be worth probably less than 1% of what it is now. Gold is arbitrarily valuable because people think it is valuable. People don't buy gold because of all the industrial demand out there.

The value of a share of Facebook stock has an intrinsic value as Facebook is a profitable company. You can't compare shares of a stock to bitcoin. 
You can't deny that bitcoins have no intrinsic value whatsoever. They only have value because someone is willing to give you something for them. Now other things also have no intrinsic value, but have maintained the ability to store value. Gold is something that comes to mind. Art, baseball cards. I can think of a lot of things. Whether bitcoins remain desirable enough to remain valuable time will tell. If I were a betting man, I would bet no.

You're relying on bitcoin to become some sort of futuristic world currency, not just a little underground plaything of the geek sector. What do you think it'll take for my mom to start using bitcoin? That's ultimately what you want. This adds a HUGE layer of complexity which will prevent this. Saying "everyone will just break the law" doesn't bode well for the future of bitcoin.
There are a few very large holders of bitcoin who were early adopters. One day one of them will decide to cash out. This will cause the price to drop precipitously. How many crashes do you think the average casual bitcoin dabbler will take before they say "forget this" and walk away.

If part of the cognitive dissonance you experience to continue your belief that you'll make money with bitcoins includes arguing semantics like this ("I don't need food when I'm not hungry, so HA!") you're going to have a bad time. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:45:07
There may very well be no point. Bitcoins were hovering around worthless for a long time and all of a sudden got some attention. They very quickly shot up suddenly to almost $1200. I personally think this is a classic bubble based on irrational exuberance. Absolutely no different then tulip bulbs. The excitement is over, many conceptual flaws have been realized, and the price will slowly revert back down to its starting point which is nearly worthless. Once the price falls below the cost of mining, all the mining operations will halt. That will be the deathknell of bitcoin.
I'm not clairvoyant and I have absolutely no way of proving that this is going to happen in the future. This is just my opinion. But I think it's already happening.
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:51:20

It doesn't demonstrate any utility for bitcoins. It's just a stunt. So many "hey see I can buy stuff with bitcoins" is this exactly. Priced in fiat converted from fiat and then right back to fiat. Why bother. Just keep it in dollars. Almost all the "buy it with bitcoins" is exactly that. 
And as to people wanting to sublet for cash, then use cash. What use is bitcoins in that?

Okay. I think we are sort of agreeing with each other here. 
If gold were ugly and not prized over the years how much do you think it would be worth? All of the utilitarian needs for gold are very recent developments. For a long long time the absolute only need for gold was wealth.

You can pay in bitcoin but the price is still in dollars. I'm sure as soon as you pay your rent in bitcoin (which you will probably have just converted from dollars) your landlord will immediately convert them back to dollars. It's a stunt.

@_date: 2014-03-27 02:01:02




No. Read about it in Wired in its infancy (been a Wired subscriber for a long time, not sure if that gets me any geek cred). 
Bitcoin may have some utility, but 99% of the people who own bitcoins do not do so for any of those utilitarian reasons. They own bitcoins because they think they will have more value one day than they paid for them. And as soon as they think they won't, they will sell them. And if they had any idea that they wouldn't be worth more than what they paid for them, they would never have bought them in the first place. When you are using the "greater fool" investment theory you eventually arrive at the last fool. 
And anyone should be able to look at a chart showing a meteoric rise from $7 to $1200 and now back to half that and see a classic bubble based on irrational exuberance. Bubbles rarely inflate a second time. 
Sorry.

@_date: 2014-03-26 23:29:18
A stock of a money losing company still has value because people think it can make money. If one day people realize that Twitter cannot make money then its stock will become worthless.
Gold is a good analogy - something that is intrinsically worthless but people still assign it value. It has its history going for it - it has been considered valuable for thousands of years. Bitcoin can be thought of very much like gold. But it does not have history on its side. I think bitcoin will be at the mercy of a large holder suddenly wanting to sell. If it drops precipitously again I think casual users will look elsewhere. Since it's peak above $1000 it's been on a pretty steady trajectory downward. 
I will admit to not being able to predict the future, but I believe bitcoin will not be what its biggest cheerleaders say it will. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:48:43
And then they will make a ton of money by SELLING that huge stake. Like any investor if bitcoin rises to a certain profitable point for them they will SELL.

@_date: 2014-11-01 18:11:38
Bitcoin will be nothing more than cash and carry. Since bitcoins cannot be moved without the keys you'll never be able to create a robust financial system with borrowing, lending, purchase of debt, derivative investments, etc. You would have no way of demanding payment or seizing assets even after due process has occurred. If someone steals coins and you know who it is you still can't get them back. No capacity for seizure.

@_date: 2014-08-19 16:11:20
Bitcoin will need to be "banked" in order to work as any successful monetary system needs to provide a way to allow others to use your money. Dollars wouldn't work if everyone just stuffed their mattresses full of cash (cold storage). Dollars work because your money can be used by others while earning you interest. Money exists in a robust system where people can buy and sell things like debt. If everyone maintains strict control of their bitcoins then it will never rise up to be more than the medieval concept of money.

Dude, "electronics", "computers", and "aerospace" on that list are actually the same reason.  They just expanded it to three things. "Awards and status symbols" is the same as "jewelry" and is ridiculous if we expand the hypothetical "not desired" concept. And "coating for buildings" as a category? Really? Gold is valuable because humans have always thought it was a good store or show of wealth. If gold were ugly but still equally as useful for the real utilitarian reasons on that list it would be worth less than 1% of what it valued now. 
It would be a simple calculation to ask how much gold do humans possess and how much of that gold is actually being used for the utilitarian purposes you tout. I would guess less than 0.001%. 
Gold is arbitrarily valuable.

Fractional reserve banking in reality: Bank takes in a $100 deposit. They loan out $90 and keep $10 in *reserve*.
Fractional reserve banking according to bitcoiners: Bank takes in a $100 deposit. They somehow magically create another $900 and loan out $1000.
