I seem to recall that bitcoin "mining" involves using video cards as extra number-crunching processors. My joke was based on the idea that the bitcoin workload isn't (from my understanding) particularly gentle on said video cards.. and they reach their limited lifespan sooner for being used for mining.
My limited understanding of the concept, is that bitcoin "units" are 'created' by people whose machines do X-number of special calculations.. similar in some way to the old "SETI Screensaver, where you'd leave your computer running their screensaver and it would crunch numbers for SETI, giving them access to a huge, distributed super-computer... In this case, the work units you're processing are just complexified bitcoin transaction verification data.. but instead of earning just an arbitrary score for completing 'work units'.. with bitcoin, you get 'bitcoin units' which you can then sell or trade to others in exchange for money... and by doing so, you generate more transaction records for others to process with mining machines.
The units then continue to circulate, as people buy them, hang onto them for a while as a form of investment or hedge or whatever, then they sell them to someone else in exchange for 'real money', goods, or services.
I don't think there's an actual bitcoin sink tho.. meaning that unlike a system like the Linden Dollar in Second Life, since bitcoins aren't regulated, there's a constantly growing supply of bitcoins.. and no practical way to reduce that number. If that's true, the system would seem to, eventually, be destined for massive inflation.. but for now, there's generally increasing demand for bitcoins, so an increasing supply isn't inherently a bad thing at this point.
