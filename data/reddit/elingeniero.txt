I'm still not clear on why it's necessary to have an on chain transaction to open a payment channel. Why is it not enough to simply have a signed (but not broadcasted) transaction to use on the lightning network?
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:25:25
So is it also possible to generate zero-fund payment channels for free just by having a node issuing you a signed tx with a promise for 0 BTC?
This way vendors can start using the lightning network to receive payments with no set up costs?
I understand that if you ever need to close the channel there is a fee involved, but so long as adoption is good that may never be necessary. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:17:05
Will it ever be possible to set up regular payments via lightning? Like a subscription service. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:38:27
Honestly this seems to me like LN is dead on arrival if opening a channel costs $30. I don't really see any reason why on-chain fees will drop - LN will encourage higher adoption but that just means more people demanding TXs so fees will stay high I think.
Wow, I really think this is bleak, I can't see a way for this to be a success now.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:39:31
But each user has to open their own factory with an on-chain transaction, right?
This seems bleak, LN can't be the global currency solution since only first-world users can afford $30 to open a channel.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:36:15
I'm aware of rootstock. You're not answering the question.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:37:58
Yes, my concern is with the act of opening a channel itself, and whether it is completely necessary to have an on chain transaction to do so. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:06:07
Except for ETH...
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:17:25
I'm not entirely clear on why you can't "buy" a payment channel from a node (which has funds to sell).
For example, you would pay a node in fiat and they would sign a tx that gives you the equivalent of BTC and you can use that as your payment channel (no additional on chain transactions) - why doesn't that work?
Honestly, I see requiring an on chain transaction for every payment channel as a fatal blow to LN as a solution to the global personal finance problem, and I really wish it wasn't so. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:16:15
But to get on the lightning network you have to commit to 2 txs and their fees - which could be well into the $100s - and basically means no one will use it. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:30:37
Well that's exactly my point, its not a problem for you and is cheaper than what you have already - but it isn't the technology that enables those without banks to get into free personal finance. Very disappointing.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:08:43
It seems pretty comprehensive, but there are quite a few grammatical mistakes.
Also I have to say the opening a payment channel commitment transaction bit confused the fuck out of me - infographics are supposed to make things clearer, not frustrate the reader. I get that it is a complex matter, but there must be a more intuitive way to illustrate how it works.
Edit: Having read them all now and after really trying to understand what they were getting at, I am afraid to say that - for me - these 'infographics' were confusing as fuck and did very little to clarify the matter. I would like to have seen more larger-scale graphics which show the complete state of the system at each step. Instead, what we really have here is just a step-by-step text guide with some illustrations for each bullet point. Each step changes the system state in a complicated way and for me simply adding a little picture to each one doesn't help my understanding at all.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:21:28
Is it at all possible to create a LN payment channel without an opening on-chain transaction?

It works fine with testnet. You're just spouting shit you don't know about and should stay out of the conversation if that's your only contribution. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:13:35
But isn't that true for any LN transaction? What is the mechanism for stopping double spend on the LN?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:33:22
I'm not saying fees are bad, I'm just saying that requiring $30 * 2 to open and close a channel puts the lightning network out of reach for those not in the first world. I was really hoping that this technology would enable global personal finance but clearly that is not the case.
Honestly, I can't see LN being adopted even in the first world since it requires everyone to pay $30 just to get involved - and most people won't want to - which means that it will never reach critical mass and no one will *have* to.
I disagree that fees will go down - even with more TX/block with segwit etc, demand will just increase to some high-fee equilibrium, shutting everyone out that isn't already quite rich.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:43:43
Ok, but there won't be fewer on chain transactions because presumably the dream is that LN encourages adoption - so more people need to open channels - so more on-chain transactions. As I say, it will reach some high-fee equilibrium.

The only times people have been burnt in crypto (apart from price fluctuations) is when they haven't respected the above. Don't trust exchanges, and keep your keys (or your seed) in as safe a place as you can imagine.

@_date: 2017-11-03 12:35:52
The max throughput of BTC transactions means it cannot be used as a widespread currency. However, it can be used as the value storage layer underpinning a mass currency. 
This is exactly what the lightning network intends to do. Transactions on the lightning network will be guaranteed by bitcoin, but the vast majority of them will never actually hit the bitcoin network.

What currencies are most traded in SK?
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:07:21
Maybe, risks involved in selling:
- You must leave a large part of your investment in a potentially unreliable exchange, possibly for weeks
- By cashing out, you become liable for taxes on any increase in the value of your BTC
- In the case of a sudden rally, you may not be able to buy in time to realise the benefits of selling
- In the case of a strong rally, there may not be enough liquidity for you to buy back at a profit
You can definitely make money by this sort of day trading, but it is an even higher risk than just hodling.

Interest rates have remained extremely low since 2008 even through the economic upturn over the past few years. This has caused an increased amount of borrowing which has caused many to become highly leveraged. There is speculation that interest rates will be increased soon, which will cause some highly leveraged businesses to become over-leveraged and to default on their debts. The speculation is therefore that we are in for a big correction soon, so investors are trying to take their gains now.

People are trying to move bitcoins quickly right now due to the slide. Miners who create the blocks prioritise high fees. In order to move the bitcoins quickly people are offering higher fees to be processed quicker. This is why your transaction says its 'Low Fee' - the transaction is still in the mempool
but because you only offer a 'standard' fee, no one has picked it up yet.
There's no way to cancel it, but you haven't lost it in any way. Either it will be processed once the frenzy dies down, or the transaction will be voided after a certain timeout (I'm not sure what it is exactly, its a few days), at which point you will get them all back.

Same as Coinbase - £15k/week is what its showing for me right now (with ID &amp; Bank Account verified).
You can sell as much BTC as you like, but you can only withdraw that much cash from the exchange. Depends on your risk level, I suppose. GDAX/Coinbase (same company) do seem to be the most reputable/most reliable, but there have been bigger companies fall before, so...
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:57:14
You can trade arbitrary amounts on GDAX.
However, withdrawal is limited, and I understand if you're not happy leaving £50k on an exchange waiting for BTC to recover...
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:13:43
That's really interesting. Would you propose that mounting and (manually) searching is better? Under which circumstances?
Genuinely happy to hear your advice.

Yes but in the case you wanted to export them for use after a fork - how can you do that? I presume there is a way.

It's a good thought, but in this case the `find` is on an image of the drive that we've created on a different (presumably fully working) device. 
You could try looking in the obvious places on the disk before creating that image, but that requires mounting it first, which *may* be worse than imaging it - the imaging happens sequentially on the drive and so should be the most likely operation to succeed. 
If you do want to try this, then absolutely mount it in read only mode:
`sudo mount -o ro /dev/sdX /mnt/drive`
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:16:56
`conv=sync,noerror` does exactly that, and so long as you use the default block size then `dd` performs the same as `ddrescue`

I actually did this recently - hard drive was damaged in 2011 and so I replaced it at the time. Luckily I kept the hdd and was able to recover the data. I didn't have any issues mounting the image so I can't offer any advice with forensics tools, but here was my approach (using Arch):
1. `dmesg --follow` (shows system events)
2. Plug in HDD on USB (I used a simple USB HDD attachment)
3. *Hopefully* see the device appear on dmesg - let's say sdX shows up so its at /dev/sdX
4. `sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/image.dd conv=sync,noerror,notrunc status=progress`
5. `fdisk -l /path/to/image.dd`
6. You should see the `start` and `end` sectors of each partition - each 'sector' represents 512 bytes (even if your sectors are actually larger, fdisk shows sectors as 512B sectors), so in the next step when we specify the start you need to multiply the sector number by 512 to get the `start` and `end` byte offsets
7. `sudo mount -o ro,loop=/dev/loop1,offset=&lt;start_bytes&gt; /path/to/image.dd /mnt/loop`
8. `cd /mnt/loop &amp;&amp; ls` *hopefully this works!*
9. `find -name wallet.dat`
`dd` Notes: 
- **Triple check `if` and `of` are correct!** You'll lose everything if you mix them up.
- Use the default block size to reduce the impact of errors - but it will take longer.
- `conv=sync,noerror,notrunc` ensures all available data is copied (skip over errors, pad errors with 0s, don't truncate the output file)
For me this is all I needed, if your disks need repair or your file isn't wallet.dat, then I'm afraid I don't know more than this.
Hope this helps, and good luck!

`ddrescue` == `dd conv=sync,noerror bs=512B` (as I have recommended)
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:31:49
I should have said `dd conv=sync,noerror` - noerror just skips over errors, sync keeps the correct length by padding with zeros (when you combine the two).
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:00:44
That's exactly (or rather, partially) what `conv=noerror` is for. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:40:12
I don't see how `dd` would make it crash any more than `mount` followed by a whole series of searching for the right folder or file would do.
