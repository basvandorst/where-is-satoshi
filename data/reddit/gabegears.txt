Why don't they just impliment segwit?

For customers sending from non-segwit addresses it would be their fault anyways.

Post LN would Buying Bitcoin be any cheaper (from fiat) ?
My guess would be that it would because say you buy from {exchange} they open a channel with you with the balance (and say they eat the opening fees). 
This would allow you to transfer BTC from them to anyone they already have a channel through effectively allowing them to make some of the fees back.
Am I correct or is there something I'm missing?

Pretty happy today, feels like it's all come together.
My full node is set up, and I was able to commend on some yalls.org articles!
I'm on ubuntu and I'd recommend my setup for anyone interested in running a full node.
I've got both bitcoind &amp; lnd running in the background with zap wallet for the easy lightning integration.

Is there a way to get my private keys from the Android wallet? It has a way to back it up to a file but I was hoping to move the private keys onto my PC because I'm now in a position to run a full (non-mining) node.
