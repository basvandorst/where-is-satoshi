I bet 80% of their top posts on any given day are about censorship (I would hardly call it censorship it's just bog standard moderation and it's been seen to take place in both rbtc and rbitcoin) or personal attacks against others and hardly any actual news on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:29:06
No complaints from me if that happens. Cheap(er) coins. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:43:32

LOL sounds like you still haven't learned your lesson,  get ready to kick your self again about a year from now,  and a year from then and a few years on from then, get ready to tell your kids and grandkids story's about how you once had 0.5 bitcoin and sold them for less than $600, and when they show shock and awe in their faces trying to absorb the fact that you once had so many sats/bits and got rid of them for a currency they only read about in class, that's when you'll tell them "You know what else kids, Your old man used to mine once upon a time too"  by this point they'll be wanted to VR chat all their friends to tell them about their cool granpopps,  but you stop them and tell them "That's not even the punchline to the story kids,  I had 20 whole Bitcoin back in my day!" 
"Yeah fucking right dad! 0.5 I can believe but 20 million Bits? No way!"

I personally prefer bits,  people in general psychologically don't want to hear the word micro when referring to their wealth/funds especially (i think) when it will be bitcoin their referring to  if anything microbits would be better.  
I imagine it will be bits instead of microbitcoin and Sats instead of Satoshi. 
Of course I could be wrong,  then again we probably all are,  chances are bitcoin will be used in the background and most people won't even realise it's the bitcoin Blockchain they are using.

I've been hoping for the ETF to be approved every step of the way,  rooting for the twins,  excited about all their doing for bitcoin,  but now it's so close to DDay, I feel like theres a little part of me that hopes it gets rejected, and not because I don't want an ETF approval,  and not because I have anything against the wikledoodles but because I know what it would do to the price. 
Of course no one can know exact figures,  we can only speculate but we all know the price is likely to balloon way past the ATH, I've said it before and I'll say it again,  $1000 per BTC is cheap coins! I'm not saying $1000 isn't a lot of money but who wouldn't want to buy a Ferrari for $1000?  I don't think an ETF will send the price for each coin to Ferrari money, no,  but I am saying an ETF WILL be approved at some point,  maybe not March maybe not this year or even the next but once it is improved that's a whole new avenue of potential buyers. 
if this ETF is rejected I'll be sad,  but happy in the knowledge that such a decision means more cheap coins, knowing that an approval is not too far into the distant future.

Not very helpful man,  the dude has a point,  Bitcoin was not created for the bitcoiners of reddit,  it was created for everyone,  almost literally everyone on the planet. FUD or not,  all this hard fork palava from over the other side is worrying,  not just in the sense of the value of btc but also the image it's going to give to the rest of the world,  I can only imagine the news headlines now, i don't think a hostile hard fork would kill bitcoin but it would bit a big one to add to the obituaries,  and would likely compare to the Gox in terms of public confidence.  
I imagine it would take a very very long time to recover,  the only upside would be cheap coins. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 23:43:49
Although the price shouldn't be so important,  we cannot hide from the fact that the price plays a major role. 
Price rises: Positive media attention (digital gold,  safe heaven asset,  frictionless payment method etc),  more people learn about bitcoin,  more investments made into bitcoin innovations. 1 step closer to mass adoption 
Price declines: Negative media attention (it's a ponzi, it's used by drug dealers,  the blockchain is what matters not bitcoin etc etc) more people confuse bitcoin for real scam coins such as Onecoin,  more investors waste money investing in useless Blockchain tech aka databases/spreadsheets. 2 step backwards away from the long term vision.

@_date: 2017-02-04 15:45:34
I agree,  but I mean in the event of a chain split, and there ends up being two bitcoins just like Eth, the value I think will plummet.  
@_date: 2017-02-14 08:30:49
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:33:07
My personal opinion is there is no best time to buy,  and no one knows what the outcome of the ETF will be,  if it's approved yes the price will certainly increase (I'd like to also point out no one knows by how much) and if it's not approved the price will probably fall,  how much who knows,  either way my advise is to buy,  if the ETF is approved, congratulations,  if it's not and the price falls,  you still have you bitcoin,  and your best option in that scenario imo would be to buy more (cheap coins) and just purchase a steady amount at regular intervals to balance out any loss, because like I said,  one of the three ETFs WILL be approved,  and the price of BTC will see new highs over the next few years.

Store them on a hardware wallet,  either a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S. 
Can't go wrong with either of those too, and you can rest assured your bitcoin are safe,  even if the hardware wallet is lost/stolen/damaged.  
(as long as you properly secure your recovery seed,  your bitcoin are ridiculously safe) 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:55:43
Can full nodes be run without actually storing any of your bitcoin on them? I personally prefer HW wallets over any other method of storage, why node wallet &gt; HWwallet? , that being said, what benefits do I receive from running a full node. (don't get me wrong I think I understand how it benefits the network, and I'm all for that which is why I'm considering trying to run one, but I'm curious as to whether there is any personal incentive)

Going by number 3.
Does this suggest a price drop could help towards a signaling of Segwit? 
I've seen a statement being thrown around recently something to the effect of "Holding now is helping BU", also reading a blog post by Vinnie he suggested if everyone sold just 10% it would bring the price down enough for it to be unfavourable for miners (IIRC, lazy to find exact quote but it's on one of his recent blog posts, correct me if I'm wrong) 
I'd prefer the price to drop substantially rather than a BU HF, especially if it means more of a chance of Segwit being activated. 
*please excuse any ignorance*
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:53:47
And look at how well that's going so far. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:33:01
Satoshi mined the first bitcoins and he mined alot of them, a lot. 
Satoshi is poised to be a trillionaire if bitcoin reaches a certain value. 
But the coins that he mined, do not move, they are pretty much dormant, if he suddenly moves/spends/sells his coins, it would be a big thing. 
There are two possible explanations (AFAIK) why these coins do not move. 
1. Satoshi knows these coins cannot be moved, I guess for the 'greater good' in this scenario I like to imagine the private keys to them have been destroyed. 
2. Satoshi is dead . I'm pretty sure there are only a hand full of people(s) who could possible be Satoshi, one of the most likley candidates is DEAD (even if Satoshi is/was a team effort). 
(it could also just be he didn't really pay much mind to all those coins back then considering they were worthless at that point, and mining was more of a hobby for most, the coins are almost certainly inaccessible for whatever reason. Those coins IMHO will never move, but it's unreasonable to assume Satoshi doesn't still have influence in bitcoin like that guy above suggested in not so many different words)

Lazy to find the chart now, long day at work, on mobile, in bed, but volatility has been on the decrease year after year, give it time, the 8 years bitcoin has been alive is nothing, it's still a baby. check back in some years once the training wheels are off. 
Volatility will only continue to decrease once a few serious issues have been taken care of such as transaction malleability &amp; scaling, which current have fixes ready and waiting to activated. 
If you dig enough you can even find a paper from the bank of Canada speaking on this very issue, they themselves say if Bitcoin Is allowed to mature volatility will be less of an issue.

If bitcoin splits, I don't see it recovering if two chains live on, not with them both being called bitcoin, if you think RV and his domain names are gonna sit back and call BTU an altcoin your in dream land, the amount of public confusion is going to be crazy.

Yeah test net is awesome,  but testnet is testnet.  Litecoin is live, we can see implementations in real world scenarios. 
And I wasn't focusing on the value exactly, just that its not dead.

Couple of the comments on that post seem so hateful,  jeez. 
Anyways,  not sure if $1m /BTC is a likely expectation for the next 2 years,  maybe 20-30 even that Imo is quite bullish.  I'd love for it to happen though,  I do expect $10k /btc in about 5 years tho. 
But of course,  it's anybody's guess, no one knows the future.

I dunno if I would say dead,  I don't hold any litecoin but have to cut them some slack,  good test coin for bitcoin,  even if its this use case alone, like coin will have a place in the future.

Criminal uses bitcoin for miscellaneous criminal type stuff. 
You legitimately advertise your car for sale for 1Bitcoin on Craigslist or something. 
Criminal sees your car for sale  and offers to buy. 
You receive 1 bitcoin,  criminal receives car. 
For whatever reason you decide to use an exchange to hold your bitcoin,  (never leave bitcoin on an exchange)
Exchange decides this is bitcoin that has been used in miscellaneous criminal activity. 
Exchange seize your bitcoin and do not give it back. 
Maybe they report you to the police while they're at it. 
Criminal has new car,  Exchange has 1 extra BTC,  You have pending investigation no car and no bitcoin.

I couldn't take much more after she said... "Well why do I work for dash and not for bitcoin" I used to think Amanda was cool on the Daily decrypt, back when they covered not just bitcoin or dash but all/most coins without sounding completely biased,  the reason you work for Dash and Not Bitcoin is because Bitcoin isn't a company with someone for you to work for! All comments like this do is confuse newcomers who end up googling shit like "who is the Bitcoin CEO"  
I completely welcome the idea of Altcoins,  I'm a firm believer the future will be home to bitcoin plus a few different altcoins,  so I in no way have anything against Dash, however one thing that I cant stand is the constant trying to shit on bitcoin to prop up an altcoin,  when that guy (I forget his name) was pumping ether back when bitcoin was like $400 he was spouting the same stuff,  "Bitcoin is in a bubble,  it's not the currency of the future,  its broken its this its that,  the price will tank any day now buy eth buy eth buy eth!!! " we'll look were we are now months later,  the chain split and a bunch of his listeners lost money selling all their Btc for eth right before the split,  and bitcoin continued to grow in the meantime. 
There's nothing wrong with comparing your preferred altcoin to another,  or talking about the benefits of said coin but come onnn, try to be a little objective. 
I'd be happy watching this series otherwise I used to love TDD,  but the only message I got from the few vids I have watched was,  "sell your bitcoin and buy Dash"

Thirded, I've been victim to PayPal chargeback fraud in the past, not with bitcoin but it stung just as much as it wasn't a small amount, and I don't want to use this post to vent about PayPal but it's no secret that PayPal offer little support to those affected by chargeback attacks. 
Please alert any user that selects PayPal as an option to the potential risks involved, it took me getting stung to learn of the hotbed of fraud that is PayPal.

But any new myth that drops malleability fixes under a new name would probably raise eyebrows from the SWBlockers who would immediately think/link back to this post and that exact quote lol, opening the doors on a whole new avenue of conspiracy theories for them to churn.

Not the wisest move in the world, but I remember reading an archive post (can't remember if it was from reddit or bitcointalk or where) from back when bitcoin was I think &lt;$100 and the guy done something similar iirc, sold up and went all in in bitcoin, at the very least I'm pretty sure he put his life savings in. 
I remember all the comments pretty much calling him a moron, some telling him not to do it, it's a mistake, to be honest, if I was around back then I probably be one of the people telling him to rethink what he was doing. 
We'll, God knows where that dude is now, but I'm sure he's pretty happy with the choice he made, I really  hope that this will work out for you too. 
Good Luck.
