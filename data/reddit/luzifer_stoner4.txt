their fees are way to high anyway... i got something went wrong to and the whole site is slow. bitstamp is slow as well, but i can buy and sell.... coinbase is always much higher price and their fees rip you off big time unless youre on gdax... 
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:33:11
you can use it to buy more btc, its great
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:13:34
poloniex is probably your best bet for alts
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:21:44
well lutsch meine eier i guess i was wrong

here you go mate:
also if you wanna go with the miner directly and not do nicehash get one of these:

everyone and their mother will dump that shit the moment it gets listed on a exchange... 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:57:43
well coinbase takes a huge percent unless youre on gdax (i think their cut is lower)
so when you sell a single bitcoin on coinbase your paying like 30 bucks in fees directly to coinbase
but i guess if the price difference is really 70 it would be possible theoritcally to transfer fiat to bitstamp, buy btc, transfer to coinbase and sell for fiat and transfer back to bank account... only problem i can think off is that after the first 10k your bank is gonna find all this money transfering back and forth between countries suspicous

no the situation is still very much as you say... scyrpt asics are a thing, and gpu mining scrypt would be foolish...
but there ARE newer algos that do not have asics (and probably never will) such as equihash (zcash) and daggerhashimoto (eth)
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:03:46
i pay $0.21 and am making boot loads of profit...
check whattomine
280xs or 270xs are still good cards, heck even like the 7850 and the 7950 still make money
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:17:03


when youre selling a machine that literally produces money the situation is a little different then selling consumer gpus... ASIC pretty much always sell out the preorder, no? also try to go buy a rx470/480/570/580 right now at any electronics stor in youre country... if you can find ANY for sub $250: BUY THEM. (shits 100% sold out)
current gen AMD gpus are selling like crazy cause currently they have some stupid short roi of like 60-90 days or something...
also nvidia can just do both, produce miners, mine with them for a while and then sell them... just like the asic creators currently
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:17:49
no its not, youd have to pretty stupid to think anybody is talking about mining straight sha256 with gpus... i also literally just said "different algo" twice
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:48:01
different algos
are you fuking retarded?
sha256 and scrypt have asics... they hash sha256 and scrypt
equihash and daggerhashimoto and many other dont have asics so you use gpus
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:13:21
profits from selling asics &gt; profits mining with asics yourself
also selling stuff probably is a lot faster then waiting for mining
but yeah youve kinda hit a critical point in bitcoin... thats pretty much exactly what asic manufactures are currently doing... get prorders, make miners, mine with miners, eventually send out preorderd miners once the next gen is ready for mining.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:05:58
lol thats what you get for buying asics :P
every single gpu i ever bought hit ROI easy and then some
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:41:30
no. different algos
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:04:21
ehrm those gpus are garbage and pretty much no miner will be buying them....
only 3 months warranty
No resale value
only slightly cheaper for the same performance
those gpus look very much like theyre trying to sell of their scrap... they will probably be built into things like pandaminers, i highly doubt your average gpu-miner will be interested in these (or even be able to buy thme if they want)
while i hate these chinese miners as much as the next guy... changing the pow would probably kill btc... change it to what? equihash? daggerhashimoto? something new? lol
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:27:01
i dont think switching to an already established algo would work out at all... just imagine btc switched to dagger tommorow... would you really mine btc with your gpus if your making more mining eth? youd be fighting every other gpu mined coin for hash power and as long as btc is not the most profitable, youll lose.
i really dont think going back to gpus will work for btc with how mining has evloved... even though i hate asics... i think best case scenario is if bitmain (and other small ascis producers) go under and AMD and Nvidia start releasin consumer sha256 asics (fat chance)
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:50:31
no speculating, no gettin lucky, just mine and sell that shit. or if you dont want to bother with poloniex and selling the alts yourself just use nicehash.
dude its not that complicated, just look at this:
[whattomine with 1 280x](
or this:
then download this and run it:
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:19:26
yeah id hope they have enough ethics to realize they shouldnt do that... with the curren asic producers i have no such hopes, theyre very clearly fukin their customers
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:09:22
yes. yes it is. i just read that blog post and am now looking into how to signal support for bip148, cause fuck those crazy miners.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:10:43
ok fine ill bite: change it to what?
without a suggestion of what we should replace it with, you just sound like a moron who doesnt know what hes talking about...
so i ask you again... change the pow to what? which algo?
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:02:19


say what now? that loud fan noise coming from my living room disagrees.... its really profitable to mine with gpus right now, shits sold out everywhere...
mine eth or zcash, or whatever
