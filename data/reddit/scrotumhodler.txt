Bitcoin was created by the Fed, the government needs a way out of the debt crisis so they floated bitcoin. Yellen, Greenspan, Bernanke all own bitcoin.. they know dollars are worthless. Think about it.. they know there’s not enough gold to use as an a efficient currency when the dollar dies. The world economy runs on dollars.. HODL

So how does this work.. if I don’t praise and promote bitcoin or if say anything remotely questionable, I will get banned? Is that why there’s only a few people posting now.. because anyone who questioned anything got banned? Will I get banned for this comment? Why would you want this? Everyone can see there’s no one left to talk about anything now

How many hashes take to build a block? I was trying to calculate it but my spreadsheet keeps crashing. Does anyone know?

Why are so many trolls here now?  Bitcoin doesn’t stand a chance because of paid shills! Why don’t they get a life!

Yes I think so as well. When is the true floor? I’m waiting to buy

People keep saying institutional money is in. Can anyone point to an institutional investor that is actually in? If it’s public money or a large hedge fund they are required to publish their position. I’m very interested in this

I deleted my old account earlier this year because I’m trying to hodl and didn’t want to be distracted by the (temporary) price drops - had to come back to say that the trolls here from r/buttcoin are having a major effect on sentiment and someone needs to do something about it

Are we HODLing or using it as a currency to increase adoption?
People here saying the price is going down but they are HODLing - this makes zero sense to me? If you think it’s going down you should sell immediately??
People here in r/bitcoin saying bitcoin is dead?

I was going to buy some coins given what happened at this time last year, except the sentiment around here is very bad and no one seems to be able to agree on anything about BTC right now? If bitcoin community can’t agree on anything bitcoin - where does that leave us?
