No I don't think they were into bitcoin, it seems people *wanted* to understand it like this when Xi embraced the *blockchain* topic lately

The best guess is still Hal Finney, because he was so close to the topic that it would be imaginable. And he doesn't communicate any more because he died in 2014.
Agreed there's no evidence, but some plausible facts which would fit together.

Funny question, considering the fact that each *bitcoin* ATM found out there still gets its own post and encouraging upvotes in this sub..

Bitcoin isn't hard money, it's a millenials libertarian dream. What is one bitcoin worth? What the next bagholder is willing to pay for it.

But you can evaluate the technical limitations of bitcoin and LN and decide for yourself whether you think it can run the whole American society, or the whole world.

It seems that you have never seen the world without the internet.

Because he died before he could change his mind.
RIP Hal Finney.

With a fixed supply, and more and more coins lost over time, it's mathematically clear that on some day in the future, no bitcoin will be left.

That's a lot of unfounded assumptions here. Bitcoin could also hover around between 3k and 10k for the next ten years, supported by a nerdy group of followers "guided" by the pumps and dumps of a few whales.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:45:28


Better you only buy at 3,000 - then you get 3.3 coins for your 10k of cash, and you spend the transaction cost only once.

The ok boomer "argument" means to ultimately hoist the white flag - if millenials / gen x guys would be able to speak in whole sentences, it would read:
"Ok boomer, I accept your superior knowledge, experience and life performance. I can say nothing more because the only thing I can do better is useless gaming."

With a fixed supply, and constant losses of coins, there will be a time when no bitcoins are left.

Gold's intrinsic value is actually based on its use for cultic items and jewelry. The use of gold is proven hundreds of years before it was used as money. Of course scarcity is required for a money equivalent, but it's a big mistake to think it's *only* about scarcity. Gold was originally demanded outside the financial world, the ancient priests used it to order cultic items, and later the church used it widely in their buildings, as kings and queens also did. Later it was used as a coin, and today I believe that the real value of gold is only partly intrinsic, and the rest driven by speculation. However you can see already that the price of gold is climbing again, I'm very convinced that it will rise sharply if the bubbles are going to pop.
My understanding today is that gold and bitcoin are solely measured against currencies, and gold gets a risk premium by the masses of people (and maybe by the governments) which rises its demand. Bitcoin's tiny market seems to be driven by professional speculators who aren't bound by regulations, and with a significant percentage by a group of younger mostly American libertarians, which put all their hopes and dreams into it.
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:26:29
No, because there are trillions of items in the real world out there which have a dollar price. So the value of the dollar is measured against this huge basket of real-world items on a daily basis.
@_date: 2019-11-14 20:15:09
Surely, if you want the markets to develop their ideas freely. However exchanges would need more regulation, to protect the customers.

The thing is that blockchain is about decentralization, however most private companies don't have a use case for decentralization: The nature of a successful private company is often to control everything, if you look at Facebook and Google as very prominent cases. Blockchain would mean for them, to give up a part of their control.

To be honest, bitcoin won't be a widespread currency ever, due to the obstacles described in the article. LN won't work at the end of the day, let's face reality. Today, the digital gold narrative is the one which keeps bitcoin alive, and which is pursued by the majority of the market participants despite its volatility (which is possible with a long-term investment as indicated by the "hodl" meme). So bitcoin might be a volatile version of very young digital gold, and it will have to prove during the upcoming history if it's acceptance as a store of value is in any way similar to that of physical gold.

You should diversify and put a part of it in stocks, this will be a good hedge for your risks.

Unfortunately you are not right, I'm really a fan of the modern European banking system, but the long-term zero interest rate is going to kill us, because it turns all reliable economic equations upside down. Under Trump's pressure, the Fed will have to follow the zero interest rate soon again. This hypes stock and real estate beyond logic, whilst the money printing machines must run faster and faster to keep the ball rolling. However, I doubt that the fixed 21 million bitcoins will be able to save the world, I'd rather say they will go down with the ship.
@_date: 2019-11-14 09:41:39
The term "printing more money" is to be understood figuratively, but it's only digital numbers being moved around.
So yes you can pick on the banks when many people are going to get physical bills because there are way too less bills for everyone to get their money back. Which would force them to admit that your money isn't as safe there as they make us believe.
Btw, Euros aren't issued by the Fed but by the European Central Bank. There's some world outside America..

Everyone says, it will become stable with mass adoption. However, mass adoption will only happen when bitcoin is stable. Seems like a hard chicken-and-egg problem, it may actually be a deadlock if there's no good (new) solution to it.
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:22:52
When you imagine a European guy with a fast and reliable banking network: their debit card is connected to their account with a credit line, their credit card is a charge card with no or only minimum fees and no interest rates, PayPal and Amazon will do the internet stuff, wire transfers are common and quick, cash is still common and untraceable - it's really difficult to see an advantage of using bitcoin in your daily life.

IRL if you aren't a millionaire yet: 
Wake up to phone alarm - press snooze - oversleep - get waked up by phone again - check phone - check bitcoin - get lost in reddit - realize it's late - stagger into bathroom - take *warm* shower - dress up - chug down a coffee - check bitcoin - run

Well there's a dream about mass adoption, and if everyone is using bitcoin and only every 1000th citizen on earth would only lose 1 bitcoin, there's none left after two years..
