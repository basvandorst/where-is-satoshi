Not if 90% of sales are not bitcoin and we can adjust the discount as required (it used to be 20%)
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:21:43
Been 15% off bitcoin since day one. It means we make a loss on some orders when it's with another discount but it's worth it for the principle and gives a good way for those who need that extra discount to get it.

THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS

If this is really a result in people migrating coins into new storage then it doesn't represent a victory because it will be temporary and the people making the bulk of transactions (eg coinbase) aren't using it yet.

Stop using the core client and switch to something like electrum which has already got this as a native feature.

Nitric oxide is a toxic pollutant implicated with severe health issues even in low concentrations. You probably want N2O aka nitrous oxide aka laughing gas.

Too late
@_date: 2016-03-27 10:56:35
That's interesting - we operate in a market where I'd expect there to be a very high prevalence of bitcoin, and offer a 20% discount for bitcoin (goes a bit further than just being proud ;) ) and yet only 5-10% of our orders are in bitcoin. 
Sadly this leaves us chained to paypal :(

It's actually my welcome now but I'll let you off
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:14:00
What if I am generating a new address for every transaction? I can't spend it until electrum recieves confirmation of the transaction. Can I *send* bitcoin to the receiving address to achieve the same effect?
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:26:24
OK but unfortunately it's not you running the subreddit. Those who are ban those who want to discuss this or silently remove their posts
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:05:08
This is actually good news^TM
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:34:32
Cool, so again, discussion shouldn't be an issue, right?

Isn't that a mobile app?

It can at least tell them that 0.00003BTC is too low no matter the tx
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:08:12
Interesting ideas, thanks. Very frustrating that I need to pay additional fee but I guess that's the nature of bitcoin now.

I cannot recommend the cryptowoo for wordpress/woocommerce enough. 
Not only does it work so. damn. well. but during the times when we have had challenges (and there were a few when we had it first, a couple of years ago) the developer has worked hard to help us fully debug the issue and fix it, rather than blaming it on "your server is too slow" or "your customers are making a mistake".
My only criticism at the moment is that it doesn't accept monero.

There is never news, it's always just speculation until an exchange gets hacked or something, the bubble pops and everyone says "I told you so"

You obviously don't run a business.
We have 0.002% reversals through paypal/credit card but have spent many man-hours sorting out issues with stuck bitcoin transactions. 
The ideology behind bitcoin is cool but don't pretend that ideology makes things functional.

I'll sell you a signed message from one of satoshi's blocks for 5 BTC only. Something about satre
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:00:09
And yet ironically, if nobody ever bought or sold bitcoin then the price would probably be much less than it was then.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:56:03
Thank you. 
When you retrieve the xpub MPK from trezor, it doesn't show you any of the addresses that it will generate, but stupidly I didn't realise that it would be showing the first address as a receiving address in the "account" screen. 
The first address matches the check address given in the plugin interface so the master public key derivation path for a Trezor wallet is m/0/i.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:45:37
I'll leave explaining specialist technical topics to promote a business to the people with equity in the business that have specialist technical knowledge ;)
But if you like, we can do a trade. You write a blog post about drug analysis and I'll write a post about setting up MPKs with Trezor...
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:27:59
Thank you. It would be cool if you had a blog post about this somewhere as I did quite a bit of googling and got an unhelpful answer from your helpdesk before turning to reddit. Hopefully my comment above will also show up for other folks googling this in the future. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:48:58
I just found [this]( comment from which is talking about using python to generate addresses.




























So I *think* that means that it's m/0/i, can anyone tell me if that's correct?
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:44:49
Thank you :)

[15% discount.]( Been believing in bitcoin since day 1. 
You can check out  for sites that accept bitcoin

Reagent tests allow you to check substances to see if you've been sold something you weren't expecting, which is obviously a major risk factor for people who use drugs. 
Been accepting bitcoin since opening and the rising exchange rate has made the tests sustainably cheaper than anywhere else in the world.
