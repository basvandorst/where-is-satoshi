I get the sense that distributing ads needs a cohesive organization.
What's unique about the open source idea here with a base p2p layer, is that we could have a system to choose 1-to-1 as well as do more.

True your final idea needs it to be open source bitcoin to the core!!!! That rocks.
I imagine how empowering it'd be, to distribute space for ads as freely and shared as money.
Keep standing your ground and advocating. The idea is important to plant, before it is watered by greed.

Research Idea:) If we find existing open source ad tools which already process payment with major providers, we can prob more easily add a Bitcoin method.
An open, distributed ad coin ~ could free us from search engine and media monopolies!!

They are here again, and need our support. It is probably very tough to organize and distribute ads and words as/using a currency like search engines do.

Middle men can work with a technological middle layer.
Bitcoin took life by action of a profound ledger, with a viable way few could have imagined. So can bit ads, where a deep blockchain runs value and ranking calculations and tracking.
Imagine AdWords being a social function, and social utility, for sharing such powerful social dimensions with a protocol that let account for such influence.
Who knows. I like OP is asking!, sans work it might take, to realize.

A bit of information is important to share about empathy and compassion.
