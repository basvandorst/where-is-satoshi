The legitimacy of those claims notwithstanding, Libertarianism as an idea is about going back to the past.

You're straight up wrong and ignorant of centuries of economic theory.

Do you think libertarianism is progressive?

Having a wage system rather than receiving the full value of your labor isn't something that you can base in nature.

You do own your labor, that's why you have every right to organize and fight those who seek to extract surplus value from you.

That's an idiotic analysis. The full value of your labor is not your wage. If you're self-employed you could argue that, but that's not how society is organized. Your employer has given you the lowest possible wage that he can, with workers competing on the labor market. If you do not get a job, you starve. The power relationship between employer and employee is not some magical benevolent relationship. It is a relationship of one person who needs a job and will take what they can get, and the other who needs labor done because it will create value. The value of the labor that you do is your full labor value. You are paid a wage for this work, which is potentially a tiny fraction of the profit it produces.
