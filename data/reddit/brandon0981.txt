I think because this is supposed too be a place where discussion about bitcoin takes place, not bs like this.

Very true. Any place your recommend?

It's autocorrect on a phone. Are you that insecure with yourself that you have to go on reddit and correct mistakes no one cares about so you feel useful?

I would never buy in at break points like that. 10k 15k 20k. I just feel like the psychology of people see those solid numbers and they can calculate their profits quicker and it makes the decision to sell easier.

Make your own wallet through a wallet generator and store the coins. Cold storage. If you want a good trust worthly site, gemini has been great for me. Also look into the Exodus program for your computer.

I've been using it for awhile and it's been great. I easily exchanged btc to dash with them, which was awesome. But all around it's great. Always keep recovery codes in a safe place as well(fire proof safe, a trusted site away from home)

$60 is way too low to invest with the fees right now. I'd either pick ETH or LTC to invest in, or wait too see how this lightning network plays out.

You're in the wrong here, no one implied that cops were stupid, reread the comments.
