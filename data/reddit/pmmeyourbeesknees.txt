In fairness, in a disaster scenario, ALL money is temporarily worthless.  BTC, USD, Gold...none of it will beat a gun &amp; ammo, a generator, non-perishable food, tools, gasoline, etc.  You can't eat gold, you can't heat your home with a $100 bill (for very long, they burn fast)...
The value of any money in a disaster is limited to your ability to outlast the disaster conditions so that people will be willing to accept something with no immediate tangible value as a store of value for some future purchase.

Nailed it.
Welcome to the non-conspiratorial, boring explanation for why moving off the gold standard actually made sense.

I agree.  If your government is to the point that they are banning you from the nation's travel infrastructure, how on earth does using bitcoin help?

I understand the general criticism here, but I don't think the ECB was bragging, that's a one-line, straightforward answer to the question posed.

Ron Paul...yeah, that should help with mainstream acceptance.

I'm really impressed with and excited by bitcoin, but you don't need to buy into random Ron Paul gold bug bullshit to support bitcoin.  Modest inflation is a feature, not a bug, of the last 100 years of Fed US dollar policy.

The initial "radical transparency" thing he was doing had some merit, they played an important role in exposing corruption in some instances, but he also developed an agenda and fell away from the original mission.  He honestly had this coming, and I don't really feel badly for him.

I mean, for starters, we literally have his DMs with Trump Jr.  He was advising the Trump campaign, openly campaigned against Hillary Clinton online, all while publicly saying he had no interest in who won the election, only in transparency.
So if you accept no other criticism of him, he's an outed, confirmed, repeated liar on the very issue that goes to the core of what he claims to be about: transparency from potential and elected officials.

Beats the hell out of crippling inflation destroying the purchasing power of your paycheck before you've had a chance to spend it.

Trying to further understand the actual mechanics of bitcoin (and crypto in general).  The only part of the technology that keeps tripping me up is this:
If there's no central authority governing bitcoin, how does the concept of the "private key" work?  As I understand, the public key is essentially an "address" at which bitcoin is received, and the distributed ledger creates a situation where everyone knows that address "12345" has 1 bitcoin.  The private key is necessary to spend that 1 bitcoin, and can confirm that against the ledger that everyone is keeping.  But how does a specific private key associate with a specific public address, and how does the private key successfully release the bitcoin if there's no central authority saying, "Yup, that's the right key, process the transaction."  
**TL;DR:  How does the private key certify a transaction as legitimate in a public ledger while also being private from the public ledger?  It seems like a paradox.**

Thanks for your explanation and the specific terms to search when looking for some light reading...I think the actual "crypto" in cryptocurrencies is fascinating, but I can't say I fully understand the intricacies of the cryptography yet!

As insane as it is to imagine something like this happening now...it kinda worked.  The goal was to break the act and psychology of hoarding money, and in that it was successful.
