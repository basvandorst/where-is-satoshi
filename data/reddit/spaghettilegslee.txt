I think that's correct.  Only way crypto stops the madness is if you couldn't convert fiat even at inception.
If your job would only pay for your labor in crypto would you accept?  What if you couldn't convert to fiat? Before mass adoption that would be unlikely to consider.
If crypto ends up being the world's "real" currency, the "all powerfuls" will have bought up most of it with their "fake" dollars doing little to change the status quo.
Bitcoin seems to be unlikely to accomplish stopping them for this fact alone.  I'm not going to speculate or conjecture its future utility or value,  but it's not going to stop fractional reserve banking or its almighty propietors in its current form.

If BTC ever hits $10M we'll be blowing our noses with $100 bills and even $1M US won't buy very much.  Venezuela status and not lambos.

Your points on fiat are duly noted, but how possible is it for something to come along and turn bitcoin to a shitcoin?  Do you know what Prodigy or AOL were?  They dominated the limited ISP space once upon a time.
Blockbuster, MySpace, Sears... going to infinity seems less likely than going to zero.  Bitcoin is crypto king for now and the best viable bet, but talking about going to infinity seems just like Blockbuster and MySpace not being able to predict their demise to different players.

I agree that there aren't any players currently on the scene that will replace it, but I will have to respectfully disagree on it not being replaced. There will be something to come along that none of us saw coming today and holding bitcoin and dreams of mooning will be a quaint memory.
You can't improve on 0% but you can certainly match it while improving in other areas.  Massive adoption is necessary for this to work and I think one day it will.  Just not sure bitcoin will be involved when it does.

I certainly hope you're right and everything you say seems copacetic, but less than 5% of my money rides on that hope. My confidence level in this space is much lower than my hope.  As a store of value it may be interesting, but the price is directly affected by the amount of fiat pumped into it.
I was always more interested in it as a medium of exchange.  The hold til it moons seems self defeating.  It's only mooning if fiat literally becomes worthless.  At that point, US dollars, Zimbabwe dollars, or Venezuelan bolivars to bitcoin ceases to have meaning.
$10,000 for a bitcoin has meaning since I know what I can buy with $10k.  If I can't buy a loaf of bread with $1,000 it wouldn't mean much if I had $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin.
When wages for labor are paid in bitcoin is when I think the true value of it will emerge.
