Resistive heating is %20 of grid consumption here and even more in colder climates. Hot tubs was a joke.

60k people in line, it went up by a few hundred in a minute.

Not quite. Hot tubs consume more energy world wide. Actually, that's a good idea, Bitcoin Hot Tub.

Be strong everybody. We'll do what it takes. This is not the end of the world. I'm voting with my wallet next hardware purchase.

Again? Sounds like you need a hug.

Upvote. I see weird activities here as well. Some in the form of comments on fresh threads with no frame of reference.

Bits makes sense to me. Simple and easy to adopt.

You have no idea how happy I was to read this after so many cry babies saying the sky is falling. I truly think this concept is the soul and foundation of bitcoin.

We are brave for taking the risks even when players with more displacement come out and play.
@_date: 2019-08-25 19:23:24
Nope, you are safe.

vnc uses port 5900 for incoming traffic (port forwarding). OP did a huge security no no, should have setup open vpn instead of opening his PC to the whole world. This is the equivalent of spreading your cheeks to the entire internet.
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:44:47
did you have port 5900 open?
@_date: 2016-02-23 04:46:28
Yes yes and more yes! I won't even consider a block size increase until there are 2m subs here. What percentage of transactions in blocks these days represent true person to person or person to business exchange?

The comedy is everyone coming here to talk shit. Paid or not, their little pee pee flopping in the breezy.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:20:04
Wow, good job! Nighty night.

Hey! What about sending a fraction of a bitcoin to the SHA hash of the purchase agreement? You could do a brain wallet of the text in your agreement but just a hash of the PDF should be ok, no?
@_date: 2016-05-06 23:43:45
Ok grandpa...
@_date: 2015-10-27 03:43:20
I love you guys

LOL, you're probably right.
