I read that article and am seriously interested. Why or in what fields do you think it will or could have a big impact? Mainly in computer science?

The link is broken. Or is it me?

Counterparty is a protocol on top of the blockchain, afaik similar to Colored Coins, but with an "alt coin" (XCP). 
To create the XCP they used the method "proof of burn", which means that everyone who sent BTC to that address until a certain date got XCP (1000 XCP per 1 BTC). This is a more fair crowdsale compared to the ethereum crowdsale for example and ensures that the developers aren't scamming the investors, because they themselves don't get the money. On the downside, they can't use it to develop the project while the ethereum developers can.
Edit: In addition to that, XCP are held in normal Bitcoin addresses and with this method the distribution process could have been done easily. The total supply is fixed and was available from the very beginning. No mining needed, no premine from the developers neither.

How did this guy  manage to get 0.1 BTC in under 30 minutes? Seems to be quite lucrative...

Thanks for your help. I'm consdering this but it confuses me that I'd need to change router-settings or something just to reach a website. I've never had any problems with bitstamo before and every other site seems to be working. What could cause this problem? And are there "easier" fixes?

Website seems down. I tried different browsers, none is working.
edit: "This webpage is not available" says Chrome for example. I tried online-proxys, but they don't work neither.

I don't want to be mean, but you asked and honestly I find it a bit embarassing. Painting a bitcoin logo with a very simple represantation of a network isn't exactly what I would call art.

Thank you and sorry...

And miners are the shovel. Coinbase is the bank. You know what then happened...

Thanks for your answer :)

If a bitcoin is worth 1 $, market cap is at max. 21 million $. So nobody can send 30 million $ through the network, nor can 30 million people use the network at once.

Thats like 3D printers printing 3D printers.

Following that argument we should stop showing mohammed-caricatures now. It could very well undermine free speech because of fear.

I'm not sure what you mean, but there are 25 new BTC every 10 minutes; at current prices 700 $ is "invested" every ~2 minutes.
