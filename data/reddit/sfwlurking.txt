I politely disagree. I have a wallet already, it was filling it that was complicated, but as someone else pointed out, appearently there's apps for that now. That's a great step in the right direction. Even my mom and I can download apps.

I am not complaining about the money I could have had. I'm doing ok money wise. I just wanted to know your opinion about bitcoin's user friendliness.
I'm glad you succeded in getting into bitcoin early, but to me bitcoin is not about making more money. It is about using it as a currency. It's about the future.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:53:09
Yes, if not an heart attack, at least I got a headache. Thank you for your prediction. I hope the explosion happens sooner though!
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:08:21
I'm sorry but that doesn't sound probable to me. Especially if it doesn't start getting mainstream and easy to use BEFORE fiat is gone..
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:37:13
So who will use it?
No offense, I'm just curious. I believe in the concept of bitcoin. I'm in it for the long run. I just wanted to start a disussion about it being a bit "not user friendly" and get answers to if it ever will be. I'm not an enemy, I like bitcoin, period.

Yes buying something worth over the number 1 does sound better and it doesnt matter that it is in the thousands (Look at japanese yen or viatnamese dong).
Less volatile value is the hardest part to accomplish I'd say and it's even hard for me to imagine. So many people treat it like a stock or investment, when the annual interest is less than 5% those people might lose interest. It really need to happen though if it will ever stand a chance at being used as a real currency.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:16:54
Thank you so much for agreeing with me. That video seems great and I'll watch it when I get home!
I am buying the dips and I haven't sold yet :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:56:40
That would be awesome! They should really make that happen!
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:16:52
When Bitcoin reaches the point were it is used by everybody everyday without even giving it a second thought, like the internet, that day I will celebrate.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:37:41
What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:37:24
My feeling exactly. I lost quite a big chunk of my profit from canadian weedstocks..
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:10:33
Setting up a bank account is something I personally consider very complicated compared to buying items online or in-game currency in video games.
Ps. It took me over 30 minutes to write. I am not good at english nor at expressing myself with text.

The peltier effect is an effect whereby heat is given out or absorbed when an electric current passes across a junction between two materials. 
Your welcome :)
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:57:50
I didn't find the app back then, is it new? If so that is awesome, one more step into mainstream usage! 
Like I wrote, I couldn't get approved on coinbase due to me living at my parents place and the bills having their names. Why do we need to be approved? Why can't we buy bitcoin like we buy items online or in-game currancy in games like LoL or Wow?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:45:30
Yes!! We need the smartphone of crypto!
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:31:54
Yes, someone said we need the Ipod of crypto and I agree. I hope it's being in development and available to the public sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:46:15
In my mind 3 days of research is such a commitment for the avarage person. But it will hopefully change in the future :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:44:36
Hadn't head about RSK and had to google it. It sounds too good to be true.
So in your opinion Ethereum is unnecessary and will eventually die out?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:43:37
Yes! I think the problem right NOW is the exchange process. But I believe it will get easier. I just hope they are working on it and implementing it soon.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:20:02
He, mined for a couple of months and lost his private keys when he threw away his harddrive.
Now he feels regret, but he would never buy bitcoin (or stocks for that matter). He's simply to afraid to risk his hard earned money on any gamble.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:35:50
There is a lot of hostility in this subreddit towards anything that's not glorifying bitcoin. Especially in the daily discussion.
I just want to start a discussion and get some answers to what is being done to making bitcoin more mainstream.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:19:20
I'll continue to buy the dips and keep looking forward to improvements in user friendliness and real applications rolling in!
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:49:40
I just imagine that having more users will let them test different applications and get more feedback. But maybe it's better to finish the product beforehand like you say.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:43:27
If you are implying that I'm stupid, that might be the case, but is bitcoin only for smart people? 
Don't we want it to be a global currency for everybody?
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:06:20
Like I wrote in the post: The second time I gave up was when I had to get my account approved by sending in passport and bill pictures. If it was as easy as going on a website and buy some with a credit card then I would have done it a long time ago because I shop items online every week by doing that.
I understand that it is possible and "relativlely" easy to buy bitcoin today,, but I would have to guess that a lot of people give up at that stage like I did. 
To be honest I think the concept of private keys and electrical wallets is a bit troublesome too, but like I said, I am a very lazy person.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:04:31
Do all countries give you a 3% discount when using credit cards or is that an american thing?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:47:34
Oh I see, I completely admit that I'm not very understanding of the technology becind bitcoin. I just really like and believe in it's potential.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:26:08
Too late? I'm not doing this to make money. I want a global curruncy that I can use when I travel (I lost so much of my hard earned money to fees when I lived in Australia for a while..).
When all the "normies" starts to buy I'll gladly do the same since it's probably because the tech has been proven to work and be usefull.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:02:50
Interesting, I didn't know this about the first digital cameras. Our first digital one was a big Olympus.
Do you think that the price of bitcoin will have to stabilize before these debit cards are released?
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:20:19
And in the ethereum subreddit they write that they have sold all their bitcoin for ethereum. I guess the future will tell, it's an exciting journey and I'll own a little of both just for for the fun of being a part of it.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:59:15
My thoughts exactly! Upvote for you sir.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:41:14
Do people still use Ipods today?
Not picking a fight,  honest question, I abandoned mine years ago when my smartphone did it nearly as good. Some would argue that it does it better today since you can download songs directly using your phone.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:45:21
Thanks for the links, I have some reading to do this morning.
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:03:07
Yes true, I wish I didn't have to verify myself though, but even that might be much easier in the future. In Sweden we use something called mobile bank-ID. We can verify ourselfes in many places by just confirming it on an app in our phones with a personal code.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:38:13
I hope you are right, or maybe I should say that I believe you are right because I believe in crypto. I say crypto instead of bitcoin since I'm a bit worried that it's not up to us which coin will succed. The big guys like Facebook, Google or Youtube will decide that I'm afraid. Blockchain technology is a no brainer, it will succeed, I'm just afraid that it won't be bitcoin, even though I sincerely hope so, partly due to the fact that I am invested, and partly because it was the first coin. It deserves it.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:38:22
It sounds like a great way to avoid handling cash in stores. In Sweden cash is being phased out and in 20-30 years it might be completely gone.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:29:28
Wouldn't they still benifit from marketing? Getting more users etc.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:23:34
Oh I will. I just hope that the day will come when people like my friends and family won't have to "read and learn", only use.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:49:56
Do we know when these debit cards will be available?
Would they work in any store, or only stores that choose to accept bitcoin as a payment option?
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:43:11
In this future of yours (which sounds plausible and likely to happen) will there be lots of different crypto coins in use or will one dominate?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:14:43
And I think that is great! Thank you for your answer.
Do you have any examples of measures being taken that will lead to bitcoin being purshable by my mom?
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:12:47
I agree that it didn't make it any easier for regular people to buy bitcoin (except cutting down fees and queue times). But did it actually make it any more difficult to buy?
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:29:56
How has that worked put for them/you so far?
Genuinely curious, not picking a fight :)
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:13:19
Hehe, I'm trying to "crypto", but I don't find it "easy". Isn't the point of bitcoins and other cryptos that it will be used globally by EVERYONE? 
Most of my friends and family thinks it is too complicated to use.
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:45:24
Idiot proof and overpriced with sacrificed control and privacy for convenience. Isn't that the product description of an Apple product?
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:58:07
Well said!
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:48:01
I wonder if anyone will ever be able to "hack" bitcoin or the blockchain. Would that be the end of everything?
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:38:54
So bitcoin and etherum could co-exist with different purposes then.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:45:39
Only the future can tell, fingers crossed.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:33:00
I'm a Swedish 27 y/o guy who's been keeping an eye on bitcoin for several years. I first heard of it from my brother when it was only worth a few dollars and he told me to start mining some. (I didn't and boy do I regret that..)
I've been interested in buying a few times during these years, but never really understood how to get hold of some. It seemed too complicated and I never really tried to be honest, but the last two years that changed.
2016 I started googling and found out you needed a wallet etc. There were so many wallets to choose from that I wasn't sure which ones to trust and I was intimidated. I ended up giving up (again, big regret...).
Beginning of 2017 I thought to myself that it was now or never. This time I actually got as far as getting myself a wallet. The next step was to acquire some coins to put in it. The easiest way after some googling seemed like buying from an exchange. Here is where I ran into a wall this time. To get approved (or whatever is it called) I had to send them pictures of my ID and some recent bills. I was living with my parents at the moment and the bills were in their name, so again I gave up (Regret regret regret).
 Yes, I am very lazy and give up as soon as I run into a tiny bump on the road.. BUT I am a relatively young guy. I have used conputers, played videogames and bought new technology my entire life. If I couldn't figure out how to buy and own bitcoin, how is my mom or dad going to?
I think that when it's as easy to buy bitcoin as it is to buy in-game currency in videogames, then we will really see new money flow in.
Sorry for the wall of text and grammar. Just a Swedish guy that needed to vent. I'm cross-posting this in a few places because it took me a really long time to write and I want it to be seen, hehe.
PS. I ended up buying into an ETF in Sweden that follows the 
price of bitcoin and one that follows ethereum. In december 2017.....
TL:DR Young guy that's used to new technology thought it was too complicated to buy bitcoin in 2016 and beginning of 2017. Bought in december 2017 instead...
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:05:56
Is that planned to happen?
I think what you are saying makes sense, it would be very interesting to see how it would affect the volume.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:48:38
Exactly, you mention good examples. I'm just curious about the progress being made and when we can expect bitcoin being as natural to us as fiat/smartphones/toilets.
Of course it's impossible to answer that, I just want to know some guesses and have a discussion.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:44:44
Yes that is absolutely an option. Direct purchases. I wonder if that will be more common in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:29:06
Many would invest more than they could afford to loose. Even if they didn't loose it permanently and it was only a dip, many would panic sell and the accusations against me would start I'm afraid.
I never advise friends in economical decisions.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:10:52
So Dogecoin and Litecoin would be like collectibles or stocks?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:40:42
Yes, but most of a country's population use fiat without much knowledge in economy. I'm just saying that I hope the day will come when it's natural for us to use bitcoin. I believe in it.
