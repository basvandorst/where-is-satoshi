What is the *Open Transactions system*?
@_date: 2012-02-11 10:14:55
I've always wondered if this is true. A new block is generated every ten minutes, but most transactions are made sometime inbetween the new blocks. The average should then be ~5, shouldn't it?

To all the downvoters: Threnx is right. It seems to be *a headache* to pay this way, phoning in and messing with addresses and such. Bitcoin-based businesses (*BBB's*) need to have easy and secure ways to pay, and when implemented right, bitcoin is the easiest and most secure of ways. 
But I understand that Grubgo is in an early stage, and I am sure you guys will figure it all out :) Good luck to you!

Well, that's the free market approach. And free markets do indeed make things cheaper and more efficient, but they are not democratic, and that leaves the poor unsafe.

You can't trust them. But the exchanges will earn more by taking a fee and having customers than to take all the money in their system and then get no income, so it's unlikely that some big actor on the exchange market (Mt.Gox or TH) will steal your money. But don't store more than you can lose there.

Well, not with cash either.

Just as cash.

I'm sorry but it's late and I bet neither you or I really want to fight with random people on the internet? I understand that we have different opinions on this, but I'd just like to add something to your second paragraph. 




I think about this as I think about the man who comes to my house and tries to sell me alarms and such that would ring when thieves enter my house. When he sells alarms, people don't buy it as an investment ("if i buy this for x money, I will save y money since it won't be stolen!"). They buy it because the seller tells them that there has been some robberies in this neighborhood, and he's worried about my family. Then I'll get scared too, and buy it. 
I think it would be the same if we replaced central-authority-cops with free market ones. They wouldn't sell security (as an investment) but the *feeling* of being safe, whether the threat is real or not. 
But that can (probably is) happen in a democracy too, if people are scared when they vote, so we may both be wrong. 
@_date: 2012-01-24 18:38:14

Well, I do believe in this thing we call democracy, check it out on [the wiki]( It's really neat. 




To ask "are you committing the fallacy of..." is what we call a logic fallacy. I can't say no, because then I give up my case, and I can't say yes because then I look like someone who is lying. 
But that people get shot more often in places where guns are common is no secret. And sadly enough, it's not only nice people who get shot (also, robbers and such are nice people but in a bad situation, but that is another internet battle to fight :) ). 
USA is a good example of this. Many countries with about the same standard of living have very much less gunshots fired at people, and also less guns. Of course it's impossible to say that this is because of the few guns in circulation, that is the best explanation. And you and I, who like to thinks logically, would use [Occam's razor]( in this situation. 
But really, I have a bad tendency to get into fights with people in comment fields on the internet so if you don't feel like arguing with some dude on reddit, it's all right with me buddy.

Many of us seem to forget that bitcoin still is beta as fuck. I can't see any big flaws with it (except that is very very defamatory (and some other things), but let's not discuss that here).

To everyone complaining about how bad it is to accept zero-confirmation transactions: many places such as this let people buy beer and stuff on a tab, and they pay later.

BIP is not *a* function, but a protocol for improving the protocol. It's like a feature request. 
A few weeks ago there was debate versus Luke Dashjr and, well, everyone else about BIP 16 and 17.

Well, if the biggest governments would want to shut bitcoin down, they absolutely could. If they arrested everyone doing bitcoin-related stuff, only the TOR-junkies (i.e. pedos, druggies and the paranoid) (don't get me wrong, other people use TOR to, but not TOR+bitcoin) would still do it. Resulting in low network hashrate and low almost valueless coins. 
Without mining pools, the overall hashrate would be very much lower (yes, p2pool, but it is to complicated for most) resulting in an insecure network. 
@_date: 2012-02-20 22:06:40
How does it determine price? It changed when I hit refresh!
@_date: 2012-02-23 14:26:21
This would only work if the bitcoin economy was fueled by mining, but after a few years mining will not generate new coins, as you all know. And therefore this is nothing to be scared of. 
If a bonnet could have 51% of mining power, that would be a problem. But thank god, if mining botnets were profitable many would want to get into the business, and no 51%-attack would be possible. 
TLDR Bitcoin wins again!

One thing I am sure many need is an easy way to take loans in btc in the way old banks do. I.e. people lend you money (savings account) and you loan out some of it to people who need to buy something for money they don't yet have. I am sure it can be done with bitcoins too!

I absolutely understand what you mean. I guess there are (at least) two different viewpoints to this question, either you see an individual doing what ze wants or you see that person as a part of a collective. 
If you see the person as an individual, then it's absolutely wrong to prohibit anything that doesn't to harm to others, but if you see the person only as part of a collective what does harm to the person also harms everyone else in the society. 
And I can't fucking choose what side I am on!

This is actually the biggest issue with bitcoins, if you ask me. The first years, btc was piss cheap and so was mining.

Yeah, true, and also the things people need are often also provided in webshops using 'old' money. 
I'd love to buy my soy milk online, buy ten 1-litre packs and have them shipped home. Actually, vegan food is a good idea, because the consumers of it arent many enough that there is a store with vegan food, and the ordinary grocery shops usually don't have that much vegan food. Also, vegan food in general doesn't get bad fast. If you send meat in the mail, it would start to sting and rot in a few days (if not frozen, but thats not easy to do). But vegan food if often fresh for a year! 
To be able to order pizza online for btc would be great (but not for my health, hah!), but you might need to start with the pizza and not the payment there, so that maybe is hard. 
I would say buying groceries online. It would not have to be more expensive than buying them in a physical shop, because it could be stored in warehouses, and god how nice it would be to not have to do that chore. 
In any gase, good luck! I think the bitcoin community is very generous to initiatives, and if there is something they would have use of that they could get for bitcoins, many would!
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:58:31
Well, duh, of course. But as long as we can't buy any real stuff (I know some people sell some, but you get what I mean) btc's have no real value for most people, except for merely trading back and forth with old-money.
@_date: 2011-12-10 19:29:38
This mystifies me. Let's assume they use the same wallet (or more importantly, they use the same **private key** for all donations but different adresses (or public keys). Then it would be impossible to know for an outsider what transactions in the block chain are sent to them. 
But when the donee (whatcd) sends the btc's to another adress, presumably an btc-old currency exchange, all the adresses that sent money to their wallet would be avaliable in the block chain. 
I.e alice, bob and cedric sends one btc each to whatcd using unique adresses for both sending and recieving, so it's all untraceable. 
Then whatcd sends all their btc to an exchange, and poof all the adresses that sent money to them are connected with the money sent to the exchange!
It wouldnt be possible to know who sent them, of course, but wouldnt it be possible to know what adresses sent money to them? 
@_date: 2011-11-17 11:28:09

I assume you use the official wallet. There is a button named adress book (or something like that, I don't use the English version). In the window that opens when that button is pressed, there is a tab named receiving addresses. Every adress there leads to your wallet. Check if your friend haven't mistyped! 
Also, the wallet needs to download something called the block chain. That is a long list over every transaction ever made, and it is used to verify who owns what coins, do that noone can cheat. The first time you open the wallet it will take some time to download it, but if you left it open over night, it should be done.

Still, why not use any web-based wallets? Mybitcoin for example, works wonders.

Well, the "half a continent" was half a joke. 
But if someone personally owned say 5% of the worlds wealth, they could easily bribe their way anywhere and to anything. They could hire murderers, they could hire politicians and judges to make whatever laws and they could buy all the worlds media if they wished. 
They could fucking buy Google.

I would suggest you download an app called Guiminer. Then look up Eligius (since it's easy to get started there, one doesn't even have to register anywhere (also, why don't other pools do this as well? To have to register at a mining pool is ridicoulus)) and connect the miner to it.
Good luck!

Excuse me, but what is FPGA?

What I mean is that if it's not decentralised, we users aren't in control of our data. P2p forums would be great

How and when I don't know, but when making a transaction you'll notice that you have to unlock the wallet with your password. 
Bad guys will try to guess your password with their computers, so to encrypt things with truecrypt would be good, but it's easier and just as effective to use a good password. 
Do every fifth word in chapter ten of your favourite novel as a password and it will be safe for ever. If it's not Twilight, everyone hates Twilight. 
Tldr: two encryptions are harder to guess than one, but it's a hassle. Get a foolproof password and you'll be good. Many dislike vampire romance novels.

Well, the forum isn't decentralised, neither is mtgox. 
All, it's not only libertarians who like bitcoin, just fyi.

Yes, we still have a chance to get filthy rich!
