Nah I’ve always wanted an exotic car since I was a kid, because I think they look really cool. I understand your other point though wouldn’t waste money just to show others that I have money.

It’s all relative. If you’re a billionaire a Lamborghini could be the equivalent of a nice dinner out to the working class. I’d go as far to say on average the working class waste more of their money then the rich do.

Can I get a tip too?

They just emailed me saying as the Christmas period is very busy, I will receive my pay end of January. The shifts were from late October to early November. So I’m really pissed.

You’re a fool if you believe any ”expert” who said with certainty. Nothing is certain when it comes to investments.

I heard that for every ounce of gold on earth, 4 people have claim of ownership on it. Golds price is artificially low, I fear the futures market for bitcoin might have the same effect.

The place I work has been delaying my pay for weeks now. All I wanted was to buy bitcoin with my pay. So angry right now

Thank you!!

A lot of people here bought at 16-20k it seems. Now they’re just bitter to everything bitcoin related.

I’ll take it.

Villa by the beach in Dubai and Bali. And of course a Ferrari superfast in dark red.

That explains all the complaining and talk of BTC being worthless. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:31:39
Don’t know about buying a ship. But I’m deffo getting a Ferrari.

Gold is actually extremely undervalued as banks sell gold they don’t even have. So if you physically own the gold, as in it’s in your hands in the long run I’d say it is a good investment.
