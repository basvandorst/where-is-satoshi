If you first transfer the coins to GDAX (no tx fee), then you can withdraw your coins for free (tx fee paid by GDAX).  So hopefully 0%
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:59:41
No complaints here either, I just wish they could get segwit and tx batching implemented... They must account for a good percentage of transactions over the last few months at least.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:42:35
He means faster in that (like you said) the tx size for a segwit tx is lower than non-segwit, so the same fee equates to more sat\byte
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:34:39
If it starts with 3, it is pay to witness public key hash wrapped in pay to script hash (P2SH-P2WPKH).
If it starts with bc1q, it is native segwit (bech32) 
P.S. - it is not a stupid question, you are intelligent for being in a position to ask the question in the first place.  :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:45:22
Of course you are good, as long as you control your private keys, you will be fine.
I encourage you to read up on how segwit works, and I hope you have a wonderful day :)

That's not correct, only spending from a segwit address gives you the fee discount

It's a veritable wild west for early adopters and exchanges.  I am eager to see how the crypto sector evolves over the next several years.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:57:12
I only know of one wallet supporting "bech32" addresses starting with bc1q, Electrum.  There may be others. 
Also, gdax  (likely many other exchanges) can only send to "legacy" addresses starting with 1, or P2SH addresses starting with 3.  (But it is not a problem to send FROM a bech32 address to gdax for example)
Hope this helps

That's the brilliant part, you can open a channel (on-chain txn), do literally thousands of LN txns off-chain, then when you close the channel all you do is broadcast (on chain) the final balance.  Only 2 on-chain transactions required.

If all transactions were segwit, fees would be at the very LEAST 50% lower.  The mempool would clear at least twice as fast, so the backlog wouldn't grow nearly as quickly.

Click "Withdraw", enter your receiving address.
If you withdraw to a SegWit address, which starts with either a "3" or "bc1q", then you will pay less fess next time you send it from your own wallet.

And with 1 minute block times, orphan rates go up.  You still have to wait for the same minutes worth of confirmations for the same level of confidence.  60 confirmations instead of 6 for example.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:44:37
why does it stink?  You send some amount of bitcoin to a multisig contract ("pre-funding"), which is still just as trustless as on-chain.  If a bad actor tries to "steal" your bitcoin on LN, they are punished by losing everything to you.  So the worst that could happen is you get all of the bad actors bitcoins in addition to your "pre-funded" bitcoin back.  sounds awesome to me.

you "lock up funds" ONCE (per month, or whatever).  Then you can transact "infinitely" with not only the party you opened the channel with, but anyone else they have a channel with, and so on.  The network grows very fast in theory.

The problem is that coinbase can't send to native bech32 addresses beginning with "bc1q".  However, segwit can also be used with a P2SH address beginning with a "3" which coinbase will send to.  It should be fixed in the coming months, according to coinbase.

I think we were pointing out different things.  Yes you are correct that given the same hashing algorithm, Awesomesauce is much less secure than Bitcoin.
My point is, the coin with a shorter average block time will have more orphans than the coin with a longer average block time.  I think Ethereum partially counteracts this with "uncles" or some shit... anyway.  Good discussion!

Some addresses prefixed with "3" are segwith P2SH addresses (there are also multisignature addresses prefixed with 3).
"Native" segwit addresses are P2WPKH, and are prefixed with "bc1q" (Electrum currently supports this, I don't know which other wallets do).
Non Segwit transaction sizes are weighted at 4x actual size;
P2SH SegWit transaction sizes are weighted 2.67x;
P2WPKH SegWit transactions are weighted 2.2x
(I might be a bit off, but these are roughly correct).
This means when sending from a segwit address, P2SH (3xxx) gives you a ~33% discount on the fee, and P2WPKH (bc1qxxx) gives you a ~45% discount.

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:15:33
I understand the question now.
I don't have the ability to explain it fully but this analogy should be close enough. 
I open a channel with starbucks, we both commit 1 bitcoin and it is recorded on the blockchain.
Over the next year I purchase 1,000 frappucinos and make a LN payment for each one.  Every time I do, my balance drops by 10 satoshi.  So after a year, I have 0.9999, and starbucks has 1.0001 BTC.  
When we close the channel, that is all that needs to be recorded on the blockchain.  .9999 and 1.0001.  Doesn't matter how many lightning transactions were involved.
Hope I understand and explained that correctly!

That is correct, I should have said they are racing to find a Hash which is below a given value.  This is essentially try (has function)+1, (hash function)+2 until the criteria is met.  Brute force if you will.
And yes, once a solution below the threshold is found, it is trivial to double check (that's what the core client does if you run a full node).
You could say that everyone else has wasted their money on electricity for that particular block, sure.

you can create a P2SH-P2WPKH (segwit address starting with "3") wallet in electrum as a workaround.  You need to use your own BIP39 seed and set the derivation path to M/49/0/0 instead of M/44/0/0

Basically, there is a way to "plot" nonces to your hard drive.  Thereby doing the "proof of work" in advance (takes multiple days) and when the race for a new block begins, your hard drive is quickly scanned (something like 0.025% of plotted nonces).  I'm not sure if Bram Cohen's proposed system works exactly like this, but this is how Burstcoin works.

It wasn't in the whitepaper, but it was the plan from day 1:
"Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It'll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years.
first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins 
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins 
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins 
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins etc...

There's no way to know right now, the best I can say is to not to do any transactions around November 17/18 when the S2X hard fork is supposed to happen.  Then wait until we see what happens, if there are 2 competing chains, and find a verified method here on reddit or somewhere that will let you safely "split" your coins

Sounds like you did the proper research and budgeting, and didn't buy more than you can afford to lose.  You'll only lose it if you check the price every 10 minutes and panic sell.  Come back in 6 months or a year, or longer, and you'll be thrilled.

I agree with this statement, it's what I've been trying to convey all along.  
Your statement:


is poorly written and implies that somehow if you buried $1.00 worth of currency (4 quarters, for example) in 1913, it would somehow magically transform into 2 pennies.

Not really, it's more a series of multi-party contracts/transactions, and whenever the channel is closed only one of these tx's are recorded.

That's sort of my question to op... 
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:28:54
Yeah we agree, and that's what I said in a couple different ways.  Also, Right Right and Right.  $1.00 in 1913 was worth $1.00.  It is still worth $1.00 today.  How is that unclear?
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:09:28


Fyi "pennies on the dollar" means a few % (literally, 2%).  So that's not what you mean to say, unless ethereum fees  are determined by transaction value rather than size (I only know how bitcoin fees are calculated which is size in bytes)

I guess you are claiming the purchasing power of the United States Dollar has decreased by 50x since 1913?  Fair enough.  I think we agree, but your wording is so confusing, I can't tell.
But going back to my original comment, you said:


That isn't true.  The dollar you had in 1913 is worth a dollar now.


Not true - if you went back in time to 1913 with $1.00, you would be able to buy 50x MORE stuff than you can buy now


Nope, it only goes one way.  1913 -&gt; 2017, $1.00 is still $1.00, but today you can only buy 2% of what you could buy in 1913 with $1.00
