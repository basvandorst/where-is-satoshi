He did not say that bitcoin will end badly. The headline is, SURPRISINGLY, clickbait. The quote was: "What's going on definitely will come to a bad ending," - The man knows about bubbles and probably thinks the crypto markets are off their rocker, which is an opinion he shares with many members of this community. The current rally might end badly for those who are in it for speculative pumps. Shame on Business Insider for turning market discussion in to yet another bitcoin obit with crappy headline! HODL &amp; CODE.

Just like in customer service, people share bad news much more readily. It's easy to find negativity in bitcoin now. Just as people lost lives and livelihoods in the land rush. The potential of technology like bitcoin to change world for the better is real. The growing pains are real. It's called evolution. It would be amazing if in 15 years Satoshi donates to the world's causes order of magnitude more than Gates and Buffett.

On a serious note - is there merit to splitting offline wallets between multiple services? If devs for one solution make a fatal flaw and that one is compromised, others might be ok while I scramble to move them?

Lending gives up control of your coins to third party which can lose it - if you are comfortable with that, go for it. Cloud mining is no profitable. Hodl!

PoW change will make an altcoin. That's a nuclear option. Let's not go there. Miner de-centralization or at very least stopping the slide to further centralization is part of core's strategy. Too bad 21 Inc is moving away from mining. It's a tough case, no bones about it. Making mining a commodity industry and putting them in a position where they serve the network without undue influence is the way to go,IMO. The balance of incentives was perverted with GPU &amp; ASIC taking over for CPU. Mining must be driven in to profitable apolitical position - do your work, earn your fees, don't screw with the network - users and nodes are decision makers, miners are infrastructure and security, hired help. Crude but necessary, I think.

Zoom out on that price chart, friend. Also, stop checking price so often. Also, how long have you been following bitcoin price?!

May I recommend an excellent article by Jimmy Song on how this fork might play out. 
As for change in PoW - threatening miners, who are acting by the rules of bitcoin, no matter what we think of their actions, threatening them with creating altcoin in which they will play no role does not seem to me like strong negotiating point. That's akin to playing chicken with a brick wall.

More from TASS:
"The president voiced the issues related to cryptocurrencies. This includes difficulties of compliance with anti-money laundering legislation and cases related to complications of identification. That is why we agreed that the state should control the process of cryptocurrency emission and its circulation. The state should take control over it," the minister said.

"I won’t speak about specific parameters now but in general we agreed that the state should take a lead in this process and to regulate it on the legislative level," the finance minister said.

What a load of hype bull. "Regulators waking up to their impotence"?! WTF. When did the regulators quietly crawled in to the corner when they were thwarted by technology? Have you seen how the E2E encryption debate is going around the world?! And this is financial regulation, with $$$ at stake for incumbent institutions and control of state power. Mocking regulators is tossing chum to fanboiz - not a wise strategy. You Mr. Keizer, are a hype man, a tool and a pumper.

They are not making tech for masses. Whatever they are making, it's for "businesses", as they decided that's where the money is now. There are many hustlers coming in to this Utopian crypto garden now, with their ICOs, permissioned blockchains, OneCoin, etc, etc, etc. Where there is money, there are greedy people looking to get it from the next mark.

S2X is likely dead. BUT - there must be, IMO, some ability for those on the losing side to  save face. It's just the right long term thing to do. Animosity and constant contention does not benefit anyone, as much we can enjoy getting segwit without 2X. I think Core can make a gesture which will allow everyone to move forward gracefully. What and how and when? That's for them to decide.

Can we call what's happening here a "ForkDrop"TM? Innovation sometimes hides in the most unlikely places. I liken this to bacteria in the early moments of life on earth. Endless copying and reproducing, rapid decay and occasional viable mutation. There is a downside of course, as the name of bitcoin gets purposely attached to an alt coin, but that's a price of open source freedom.

Would have been nice to hear the discussion which followed the prepared statement he read for the camera. Few random thoughts: 1. He did not mention any specific benefits of cryptocurrencies. 2. He listed four specific risks, in order: money laundering, tax evasion, financing of terrorism, scams. All of the above are destabilizing to the status quo of the state, aside from explicit challenge to fiat monopoly. Yet, Russia must not fall behind in allowing it's citizens to get acquainted with these new technologies, even given the risks. The petrodollar pivot, maybe? 
I get a sense that this is a python's embrace, designed to give government a firmer control on this wildcard disruptive technologies. Expect huge scrutiny of exchanges, state-approved ICO's, lots of propaganda shaping the narrative, maybe even state-issued coin. Just wait until Russian offshore money enters the market in earnest.

Miners  primary objective is not serving users - it is receiving reward for the work, by securing the blockchain with power. Their must act in their best interest. Bigger blocks are in their economic interest. It is not the motivation that other members of the bitcoin system have. Miners have had to yield in the past and seem will do so again.
Core has not ruled out blocksize increase. They have their own priorities and timelines. We obviously think highly of their priorities and timelines, as here we are, staying by Core and their vision for bitcoin. 
However, we are dealing with egos and real grievances and constant fighting takes toll on the community. So much good will can be gained by so little. We are here for long term, so the community actions should be, IMO, gracious in victory, without yielding power and giving up upper hand.

I suspect that Openbazaar will remain in a proof of concept phase so long that it will never become viable and get traction. Legitimate sellers will prefer marketplaces where they do not have to be sysadmins to run their business. Dark market sellers will shy away because they do not perceive the platform to be secure enough to hassle with setting it up. Imagine dark market seller who has to  spend much time in support forums getting the instance running. Too much effort. Development of new features is slow. Performance is slow. Dark markets are better off being based well off US shores - that, combined with better operational security will keep them more protected than promise of decentralized marketplace. I want to see Openbazaar take off, but it's a solution in search of a problem at this moment.

Thank you for a lengthy reply. I see plenty of parallels between Tim's thoughts and Gavins. This was in response to  Gavin's quote: "Physically harming others without their consent is immoral.
If you freely agree to participate in a system where the rules are clear, and somebody finds a way to take advantage of you by creatively applying the rules... especially if you know in advance that somebody COULD take advantage of you...
I dunno; borderline immoral at best. I thought the ETH folks made the wrong decision on the DAO hack fork, but they went with rules werent clear and stealing is immoral."
Would he be able to speak well on behalf of bitcoin and articulate it's ethos and benefits? IMO the answer is unequivocal YES. Is he a problematic figure for some, also yes. Looking forward to the podcast, whomever the guess will be.

Markets are more nuanced than that. Halving should be already priced in. Run up in 2013 was from speculation fever. Current relative stability is reflective of more balanced market forces and outlook. The blocksize/governance debate is depressing the price and causes concerns. Increased investment, wider acceptance and more utility are positive and uplifting. If proposes publicly that halving will cause same run up in price as 2013, that makes me regard him no more than boiler room pump and dump scammer.

Does anyone think this event will cause big volatility in BTC and alts? Many traders will close out positions. Many will move alts-to-BTC then off exchanges, to assure control of maximum BTC amount over the split.

This rally is driven by August 1 BCC event. Many traders will close out positions. Many will move alts-to-BTC then off exchanges, to assure control of maximum BTC amount over the split. Alts dump, BTC rallies.
