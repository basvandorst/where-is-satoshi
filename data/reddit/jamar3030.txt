I will invest 10% in bitcoin start-ups, 10% in my current internet business, 10% in any venture my wife wanted to pursue, and 20% in bitcoin stocks. I will use 10% / yr. to pay off debt, and keep 10% under the pillow. I will continue working part-time, and continue living minimalist. Maybe plan a cheap but fun trip every year.

Oh, right. I signed up last month before that started happening.
Voat really needs support to be able to handle the high-volume of traffic flooding to the site, and that seems to be the reason voat went invite only at random. 
They do accept bitcoin donations.

Why not check out /v/bitcoin over at voat.co? Friendly group of people and no censorship. 
All of Reddit kinda looks like a sinking ship from over there...

So, time wasn't on my side then? I have set the time (which was wrong), and will give it a shot. Tips for you.

The day I saw the photoshop hack-job, I emailed Bitpay to tell them it was terrible looking. They responded saying "It started as a joke, but didn't look too bad. We are running an experiment around the picture there and trying different ones, so time will tell what ends up staying."

If you have Blockchain setup on your smartphone, you could get into your account without login usually (and unfortunately).

It would be a subreddit where OPs will post their sites and they would be responsible for how donations are handled. Simply put, the subred will just be a place to post the need for donations only. The same as only the OPs will be accepting btc 'as donations' instead. No organizing of donations will be done on the subreddit itself. Hope that makes more sense.

Did you backup your wallet either as a file on your computer or in google drive?

I was thinking instead of the subreddit finding the causes, the causes would find the subreddit and post.
