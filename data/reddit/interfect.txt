The "latest" Docker tag is whatever was most recently published, I believe. The current releases of bitcoind support segwit. Mostly that should be the newest version, but sometimes it might be an old version if amacneil goes and builds and uploads one. If you want to be more robust you can substitute a particular version.
I'm not sure about your second question. I think while the coins are in the channel they are in Segwit-encoded scripts, but I'm not really sure.

OS X uses a bunch of code from BSD, which, like Linux, is a free Unix-like OS. But while Linux is released under the GPL 2, which requires that modified versions release their source code, BSD uses the BSD license (which is named  after the operating system), and which does not require people distributing modified versions to release their code under the same license. So Apple is free to build on BSD and sell the result as a closed-source product.

I don't believe that a free market powered by hard currency is the only effective way to organize economic activity. It's very resistant to corruption, and distributed and self-correcting in many respects, but it's not necessarily the only system with those properties.
I think a system of decentralized planning could work relatively well. Everybody's phone can negotiate with everybody else's phone, taking into account settings for how much each person wants to work for themselves versus for the public good, and then everybody can be assigned work to do by the system, in exchange for the work that others are assigned to do for them.

Does the blockchain have peak and off-peak hours?
If, say, US and EU (and China?) business hours are super busy, but for a 2-hour window when the middle of the Pacific is facing the sun there's more free space, then this makes sense. Pay high and get in now, or pay low and get in during off-peak hours (or on weekends or something).
If the mempool just grows and grows, with the low-fee transactions never getting in, eventually we'll start setting a minimum reasonable transaction value, and pricing out use cases that we might want to have priced in.

I didn't say that men weren't statistically much more likely to consent to various things than women would be. But putting your hands all over people you just met isn't usually how such consent is communicated. (I mean, you might be able to pull off a communication of consent through touch. You can offer your hand and see if they take it and go from there. But that would involve, for example, the person being touched actually communicating back through touch, not just them not running away screaming.)

Bitcoin and its derivatives have a "network alert" function. It's a way for anyone with the correct signing key to push out a message to all the Satoshi-derived clients. Altcoins use it for announcing backwards-incompatible "mandatory" upgrades, but Bitcoin itself hasn't used it in a long time.

Does the IRS have records that are any better than yours?
Do they even count unregulated and probably illegal-to-operate stock exchange stocks as actual assets?
What you should technically do probably depends on how the IRS treats capital gains and capital losses during bartering (which is what I guess exchanging one not-real asset for another would be), but what you should probably do is ignore the various fake stocks and SatoshiDice gambling and work out how much you gained/lost FIFO on your coins by buying actual stuff.

Which implies that Mt.Gox never counted up their coins on the blockchain.
I mean, it's not a trivial operation to do. You have to scan the whole however many gigs of blockchain data from the beginning, keeping track of all outputs that go to public key hashes you own and crossing them off the list if you see them get spent, and then total them all up at the end. You need to touch the scripting system, because technically even ordinary outputs are verified by scripts. I can see why someone might not want to implement that if they're doing all their own Bitcoin protocol operations in PHP and trying to verify against a live database that's changing anyway.

I'm still pretty sure change does not work like that. A change output to an address is the same as any other output to an address, and you need to sum up all an address's unspent outputs to get its available balance.
Otherwise, someone would be able to set the balance of an address by sending a transaction to it in that amount.

Do you mean the input (i.e. sending) address is completely drained (all its available outputs are unlocked and used as inputs)? Or do you mean the outputs that are unlocked are completely used (with other outputs available to that address but not used in the transaction being left alone)?
If it's the first one, you're right, it does make the problem simpler. So it might be smart to structure your transactions that way. But as far as I know, the bitcoin protocol doesn't require it. It looks like [this transaction]( for example, is taking 0.001 BTC and sending it, and returning 0.01028095 BTC as change (or visa versa) from an address that has something like 1.18 BTC available to it in total--apparently not emptying out the address.
The idea of querying other nodes to find transactions makes sense; it does look like you can set a filter on the transactions you want to download when you download a block, and still verify PoW because of the Merkle tree. But someone like Mt.Gox using their Bitcoin protocol peers to do their blockchain scanning for them seems like a bit of a hack at best, especially considering that those peers would then themselves have to scan the whole blockchain to find and send the transactions matching the requested addresses. (I still do think you need all of an address's transactions to get its balance.)

Bonus points if you can work out a way to take care of both at once; I think pushing consent culture can probably work really well for both.
I really don't believe your claim that more men are raped in western nations than women. Where did that come from?

Yes, the number of rapists is vastly dwarfed by the number of not-rapists. But the number of people who don't sufficiently respect people's consent or boundaries is still far too high, and it only takes one in any given space to make it somewhere you just don't want to be.
Men do get raped, and the idea that men are just always totally down for sex or touching is uncomfortably pervasive. But to some extent it's a matter of numbers and utilitarianism: these sorts of problems affect more women than men. And to some extent it's a matter of history: the idea that it's totally OK to touch this man who didn't consent comes from a different place than the idea that it's totally OK to touch this woman who didn't consent, and (I suspect) needs to be addressed with a different strategy.

Dogecoin has neatly sidestepped the problem of legitimacy.

The Dogecoin community ignores questions of legitimacy, drowning them out with loud yelling in comic sans. You are right that it couldn't do this if not for all the work that people put into Bitcoin.

It's a bigger issue for women. There are loads and loads of heterosexual men running around who don't understand that, for example, sex with someone who didn't consent to it is rape and is not OK.

The other is that when you go to close it it puts up that little "Wait I can't exit, I have to write to the hard drive for 5 more minutes" dialog. So if I were to turn off the computer without first exiting and waiting for the wallet to close, I'm guessing it would probably do exactly what blockchain.info is doing and somehow delete all my keys.

I know nobody wants 1GB blocks on current hardware, or maybe ever. It's supposed to be a ridiculous figure. I'm not up to date enough on the block size debate to throw out a real number.
I'm not trying to argue against raising the block size, either. I'm just trying to hash out what I think some of the consequences would be.
My original point was that block size is in a sense measuring bandwidth. 1 MB of block data per 10 minutes means that the blockchain is being produced at about 1.66 kilobytes per second.
If we were to raise that up to more than, say, 56 kilobits per second, or 7 kilobytes per second, or 4.2 MB blocks, it would be impossible for someone to keep up with the blockchain over a dial-up modem. So adopting, say, 5 MB blocks would be more or less equivalent to adding "broadband internet of such-and-such a speed or greater" to the minimum system requirements for a fully verifying node. And if you want to let people turn their computers off and catch up later, or also watch Netflix on their connections, or ask multiple peers for copies of blocks, the minimum system requirements go up higher.
That might be just fine; but it does exclude some (small) fraction of the population from being able to practically verify the chain, and thus makes Bitcoin a (small) amount less distributed.
As for you disproving my generalization, I said that nobody wanted to raise the block size and then not use the extra space in the larger blocks. That is, if we raise block size from, say, 1 MB to 4 MB, we anticipate that as a consequence the average block size will, at least for the next few months, be somewhere north of 1 MB, and that (given increasing bitcoin adoption, because we are all incurable optimists) we would eventually actually hit 4 MB-sized mostly-full blocks.
This is in contrast to the situation we would have had early in bitcoin history, or what we would have with today's transaction volumes and something like a (completely hypothetical) 1 GB block size. Back when blocks were small, raising the block size limit from 1 MB to 2 MB would not have affected the actual observed block sizes very much: we weren't using most of that 1 MB, and usage wouldn't rise just because the limit rose. Now that we're starting to actually hit the limit, raising the limit will probably increase the number of transactions that actually get onto the blockchain.
EDIT: With 1 megabit down DSL, assuming your computer is on 1/3 of the time and you are willing, during that time, to dedicate 1/3 of your connection to Bitcoin block downloads, we can scale blocks up to about 8 MB without forcing you to switch to a light node. Unfortunately, initial blockchain sync time will then be only 3 times faster than real time, but perhaps people will settle for verifying history only going forward from a relatively recent checkpoint.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:04:06
It sounds a bit silly, but systems at that scale are probably within the realm of being able to be made provably secure. Do up a C64 OS in Rust, never run any downloaded code, and it'd be pretty hard to break in.

@_date: 2016-01-10 22:17:49
If the max block size is 1MB, you need a connection that can download 1MB every 10 minutes on average to in theory keep up.
If the max block size is 1GB, but blocks are still generally 1MB in size in practice, you'll be fine with a 1MB/10 minutes connection.
But nobody wants to raise the block size and not use the extra space. In theory (and probably in practice), a 1GB block network could have transaction volumes that would cause a device with a 1 MB/10 minutes connection to not be able to keep up with the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:30:02

If you put in a buy order for less than the lowest-priced sell order, then no coins change hands. Your order just gets inserted on the bid side, under any orders with higher prices.
If you put in a buy order for *more* than the current lowest-price sell order, then coins are taken from sell orders, lowest-priced-first, and used to fill your buy order. If enough coins can be found that your order is completely filled, then it goes away, but if it is only partially filled, the remainder will become a new buy order on the bid side.
Sort of the same thing happens if you put in a "market" buy order: sell orders are taken and used to fill your buy order, but it will take as many as necessary, no matter how expensive they get, so you are guaranteed to get as many coins as you asked for if they are available for sale.
So while it looks like an order executes at one price, it can really be a weighted average of prices if it had to consume multiple orders on the other side.
If you're putting in sell orders instead, there's a symmetrical system, where your sell orders can eat up standing buy orders.
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:51:32
That's the order book. The bids (want to buy) are on the left and the asks (want to sell) are on the right. The highest bid is at the top of the bid list, and the lowest ask is at the top of the ask list.
Somewhere between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price is the magical, fictional, actual "value" of a bitcoin.
I guess they lay it out like that so the difference between bids and asks, while also easily being able to see the spread.

The only value of Bitcoins is that you can give them to someone else. In practice, since the Bitcoin economy is so small, this generally means selling them on Mt. Gox or another exchange for USD, which you can then deposit in your traditional bank account. However, since it's almost as hard to find people willing to give you Bitcoins for your things as it is to find things worth buying with Bitcoins, there are a lot of people looking to buy on these exchanges, so you can generally get a reasonable amount of USD per Bitcoin you sell.

Yeah, it's a Python script, so you want to save it as a .py, and put your passphrase instead of "oops". You also need Python. And from the looks of it the script expects to find the bitcoind executable named "bitcoind" in the directory it's running in.

It would be possible to track where the coins go from the donation address. If they all happen to go from there to, say, a known WikiLeaks address, that would be obvious. If they went into an exchange, people might be able to find that out, but they wouldn't know how the money left the exchange without the cooperation (or compromise) of the exchange.

Better answer: If you have a friend who takes Bitcoins for rent, perhaps they would be willing to trade cash for Mt. Gox USD. Or for Bitcoins you can buy with said USD.

There is one loophole in this that I haven't seen addressed: what if, sometime down the line, Bitcoin users as a whole want more Bitcoins to be created?

This is why I think Bitcoins that haven't been spent in a certain amount of time, or had a sort of signed "keepalive" transaction posted, should be available for being claimed by miners.
Of course there's all sorts of problems with this: miners would exclude keepalives from mined blocks so they could eventually claim the coins. Keeplaives would have to be free, but then the blockchain could be spammed for free. And so on. But I think the idea of all this currency falling into the digital storm drain permanently is preposterous.

* Connect to the Freenode IRC network.
* Register your IRC nickname with the Freenode nickserv bot.
* Join the  channel.
* Cryptographically register your identity with the  Web-of-Trust system, using either GPG or (more simply) the Bitcoin client's built-in ability to sign arbitrary messages.
* Find some private individual in the channel who is willing to sell you Bitcoins for whatever you have (probably at a premium due to your lack of trust ratings).

I can try and answer your questions, although most of what I know is in this writeup. There aren't that many good resources; I read [this Bitcoin Magazine article series]( to understand how the channels work. Basically, they enforce that the channel is always closed in the current state, because if you see someone close the channel in an outdated state, you can steal all the money. As for how that translates into practical considerations for running an LN node, I don't know very much.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:00:41
The simplest case is where you get paid over a payment channel, and then you spend that money over the same channel to pay someone else.
Internal nodes in the network using channels to ship money back and forth would ideally on average have no net flow; there ought to be as much money flowing from my peers to your peers as is flowing from your peers to my peers. So you could open one bidirectional channel and not have it skew too far to one side or the other over time.
For a lot of use cases, though, you could get by with monodirectional channels.

You can definitely install `bitcoind` [from the official downloads]( and install `lightningd` following [the build instructions]( You don't need containers, but since I was already messing about with containers and VMs I figured I would use them for this project. I think it's slightly easier to keep the containers up to date, and a bit more secure if someone breaks into one of the daemons (because they have to escape the container to get at the rest of your system).
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:50:17
What about KYC and AML? I suppose if you're running a money transmission business with your Lightning node, and collecting fees for forwarding money through your channels, you have to worry about such things, but every user is going to need a node with at least one channel in order to transact on the Lightning Network at all.
The legal issues seem like they would mostly be the same as old-style Ripple, where you can pass IOUs around to push money through the network. This may or may not make you a money transmitter in your jurisdiction.
If you wanted to avoid sending money for anyone else through your channels, there would have to be a way to tell your daemon not to participate in other people's routes. I'm not sure that's been implemented yet.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:43:28

I'm concerned about the implications for ERC-20 tokens and other bespoke monies. I can understand if you have to basically be a bank if you're manually taking people's money and handing them tokens of your own devising that you can cancel at any time. But if you design or deploy deploy a smart contract with fixed rules that governs a currency, or if you are a developer of a duly decentralized blockchain-based currency system, it doesn't really make sense to try and make you be a bank. It's not like you have any actual control over the transactions that happen, or like you could somehow run with the money. Moreover, I feel like the ability for ordinary people to create monies is an important one that we now have, and I'd really like to keep it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:53:40
The fees should be less. If you have a channel directly with whoever you're paying they would be 0 (although you still have to pay for an on-chain transaction to open the channel and one to close it). If you're routing payments through other nodes, they can take a cut; we have no idea what fees people will choose to set.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:42:33
I think the lightning nodes inform each other about what peers they have, so that your node can compute a route through the network to your payment's destination. I'm not sure exactly how that works; I doubt every node is supposed to know about every other node at all times.

What can possibly go wrong is whoever wrote the Dockerfiles for the containers, or malicious persons at Docker HQ, can steal your funds. The containers I pointed to are from automated builds, so at least Docker Hub asserts that the software you're getting is the software you have the source for.
If I'm already trusting the Github randos who wrote the Lightning software, I'm fine throwing a few more random software developers into the mix.
If you don't trust Docker Hub or the container authors, you can download and vet the Dockerfiles for the containers and build them yourself locally.

I don't think so, the prohibition is against things like secret codes or code words in general, and proper encryption only as a subset of that.

First off, you can't "broadcast" anything. All transmissions are notionally point to (multi)point.
That being said, you are allowed to broadcast signatures and hashes, and that's all the blockchain really is. If it weren't for people hiding secret messages in it (which you aren't allowed to broadcast) and the fact that you might get in trouble for "using HAM radio for commerce" (which is also not allowed), you could totally keep a distributed signed data structure and update it over amateur radio.

If the difficulty can't adjust down to match the remaining hashrate after profit-minded miners exit, block times could go well above 10 minutes until the next difficulty retarget.
If all but like 3 people left at once, you could get a situation where the expected block time is so impractically high that the system can be said to have failed.

I think at the moment all the pools are running custom software. If you trust the miners, and people aren't randomly joining/leaving your pool, you could just set up bitcoind on the netbook, and point all the miners at the bitcoind installation. Then you have to manually distribute the bitcoins, presumably according to how much computing power everyone chipped in.

You don't need to authenticate with 2FA to open the wallet and see the transactions and balances. But you should need to do it if you actually try to send any coins. The remote TrustedCoin people have to co-sign any transactions you make, and they only do that if you present a valid 2FA code.

I mean, it's not *actively forking now*, and we've already seen that on Ethereum you can survive a fork, split your coins, and get back to full transaction-processing speed relatively quickly. It might not be a bad place to stash your money while waiting for the BTC dust to settle.

Yes, you have to run biotcoind on the netbook instead of the normal client (as both can't run at once, they use the same wallet).


I've never needed to use the command line flags to bitcoind. The default is server=1, so the option is only there so you can turn it off. It does, however, need to be run from the directory above where it lives (my shortcut to start the daemon has  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\daemon\bitcoind.exe" as the target and "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin" as the working directory). Also, I forgot to mention this, but if you want people to be able to connect in to your daemon from other hosts, you need
    rpcallowip=&lt;your friend's IP&gt;
in your bitcoin.conf file for each remote IP. I'm not certain it supports hostnames, but it does have wildcard support, and ought to work over something like Hamachi.


As far as I know, no, that just controls whether the server is doing CPU generation itself. Remote miners use the RPC getwork command. However, it wouldn't hurt.
For more info on bitcoin.conf and what to do with it, see the [Bitcoin Wiki]( Good luck!

You probably are better off re-sending the original coins; I think Electrum deletes the transaction when it thinks it has no hope of getting confirmed.
You might want to figure out which coins the old transaction sent and make sure to send them in the new transaction, to make sure it can't ever get confirmed.
You could rebroadcast the transaction, I think, if you can get your hands on it, but IDK if Electrum will pick it up again if you do that.

I've never really heard of paxful. In general if you want to keep BTC you want to take it off of an exchange, in case the exchange gets hacked or closes down. But then you have to move it if you want to sell it.
Selling 2-4k of BTC shouldn't be too hard, but to actually get the money from the exchange to your bank can be a challenge. It helps if you are both in the same country, but even then you can have to jump through various time-consuming and government-id-requiring "verification" steps.

If you know the market is going to go up and down like that, sure, you can buy low and sell high and turn a profit.

It makes it a crappy unit of account, for setting prices in, because if you price something at 1 BTC you never know what it's actually going to be worth tomorrow.
But if you price things by some other standard, and just do the payment in BTC, you only have to worry about price fluctuations while the transaction is in progress, and it dramatically improves the situation.
It's still annoying for your bank account balance to vary randomly, but you can do contracts for "$1000, payable in bitcoin", and not worry about paying preposterously too much or too little for something.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:54:19


That's true.
I expect lots of price and fee market shenanigans if transaction processing slowed to half what it is for 4 weeks. That wouldn't translate into everyone's transactions waiting in queue for twice as long before confirming. It translates into half the transactions we would have otherwise made not happening at all during that period, at any price, because they got out-bid by the other half.
Though of course exploding fees should incentivize more miners to come online. But what will those fees do to the price of BTC?

Bitcoin itself can't pay dividends; its just a thing. You own one, or some fraction of one, and it just sits there. You can eventually sell it to someone else, and that's how you get money back.
It's possible this person has somehow lent their bitcoins to someone who is paying them interest. You can do that on Poloniex. Their [current interest rate]( in the left-hand column is about 0.1% per day, so to make $40,000 a year in interest you would need... 46 BTC sitting on their exchange, which would be worth ~$109,000. Assuming the market had the appetite to borrow all that.

You might end up with a lot of capital gains/losses when you sell.
Most of the legal issues I can think of relate to not letting it get stolen, or having someone to blame if it does get stolen. Is a $100 hardware wallet that disclaims all warranty express or implied going to be cost-effective security for $500,000 in BTC? Can you insure it somehow? If it does get stolen, how can you prove you didn't steal it from yourself?
If you lock it up with a key only you know, how is someone going to inherit it when you die? How would an estate be taxed if it has $500,000 in assets that may or may not be accessible to the heirs (and that the heirs can't prove they don't have access to)?
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:15:08
One way to figure it is to look at how much your bitcoin would be worth if bitcoin suffers critical success and basically becomes money/gold. According to [the first web site I found that purported to have done that math]( if bitcoin reached the market cap of gold it would have a price of $500,000.
Then you come up with a figure for "enough money". You can probably retire on $2 million. So in that case you would need to have about 4 BTC in order to have enough.
Another way to get an answer would be to say "if my country pulled a Venezuela, how much money would I need to solve that problem?". That, after all, is one of bitcoin's semi-proven use cases. Figure out what the travel and shipping of stuff, the being-rich-and-connected-enough-to-get-permanent-residency-elsewhere, the language lessons, and the living expenses while you look for a new job are going to cost, and divide that by the price of BTC, and that's your answer.

No, you could replace them if they were sent with RBF. Or you could spend the change (or the coins if you sent them to yourself) with a really high fee and a miner might include them both.

Don't invest in Bitcoin because you know someone who did and it worked out for them.
It might be worth it to you to invest some *time* in Bitcoin and in learning about the technology. "Blockchain Expert" is a very popular job qualification these days. Plus if you do buy some you ought to know WTF it is you are buying.
As an investment there's a tremendous return potential, but there's also tremendous risks; the only thing you can be sure about with the price of BTC is that it'll change. (Unless you invested in volatility futures or something, in which case it will stay the same to spite you). If you have $23k in money in total, you should not lose it on BTC when you need it for real life.
If you have spare money in your monthly budget, the "dollar cost averaging" investment method of just converting some over to BTC every month is always popular. It's much safer to risk $20 a month than to risk $23k. I think if you use Coinbase and [purse.io]( I think you can then turn around and spend some of it on discounted Amazon stuff without ever having to pay any on-chain transaction fees.

I think that the whole UASF thing is a good (modulo anti-Chinese racism) example of how this whole consensus-based money thing is supposed to work. If you want your money to work this way and not that way, band together with like-minded folks and agree to socially construct some money that does what you want.
It's definitely rocking the boat, and it definitely could tank the price and bring the system (if we say that the UASF side is the system) to a crawl. But I'd rather have cheap coins in a crappy system answerable to individual users than lots of equity in a slick system controlled by people with chip foundries. And frankly, I'd be happy if the end result of people enclosing and rent-seeking on my toy Internet money was that we all walked away with nothing.

There are things like [cryptoderivatives.market]( which, contrary to its name, is a smart-contract-based on-chain token exchange on Ethereum.
The problem is that it's clunky and slow. Because everything is in chain, you need to pay transaction fees and wait for confirmations in order to open and close orders or to change bid/ask prices. Order matching is more or less manual; you have to hunt around for an offer contract that someone put up and call methods on it to take the offer.
Some of this can be automated with nice front-end software, which doesn't really exist yet. But it's always going to be slower and more expensive than a centralized or specialized solution. Plus you can't buy anything (including Ether) without Ether.
I like the Ripple built-in exchange much better. The whole Ripple system is basically built around an exchange, and it's way faster and slicker (although it also suffers from barriers to initial entry).

No, it's in the document, in the part where they're arguing that Apple is sufficiently involved with the phone to be a valid target for a writ. They mention the software licensing, as well as Apple's provision of the remote wipe service, just before they note that Apple admits that the passcode feature is at least partly implemented in software (in case it wasn't obvious?).
The article, however, makes it seem like that argument is the point of the document. It's not; it's just another (weak) thing they threw in to try and pile on more proof on a point they already proved (i.e. that Apple has something to do with this case). The real point of the document is to show that Apple ought to assist with the key extraction because they have done it before and were ordered to do it again by a court.

Because between then and now a bunch of other people decided they wanted to send transactions too, and they're outbidding you for block space.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:21:26
Because of all those addresses on the left side there. A ["normal" transaction will have one or two of those]( but you happen to need to combine balances from 48 addresses to make your transaction. So you need lots and lots of references to coins you are pulling in, and lots and lots of signatures (one per address).
This makes your transaction 18,370 bytes, when that other one is only 225 bytes. So you should expect to spend about 82 times more to send your transaction that is 82 times bigger. (How it got to be 82 times bigger using only 48 times more source addresses is an open question. Maybe you are spending multiple UXTOs per address.)
This is understandably annoying, and it screws up the fungibility of bitcoin. If I send you 10 mBTC in 10 different transactions, it's worth dramatically less than it would be if I sent it to you all at once. Like paying a debt with a truck full of pennies.

You could download, compile, and run [this software]( which purports to work on AIX, and so also ought to work on macOS.

Unfortunately, people have developed special microchips dedicated to mining bitcoin that far outperform any general-purpose computer for the task. Since there's only 12.5 BTC generated every 10 minutes, and since they all go to one person in proportion to how fast they are mining, you could mine for many, many years with a MacBook and not be awarded any bitcoin at all.
You cound [buy yourself one of those special chips]( though, and plug it in to your MacBook. You could also mine other currencies that use a different algorithm that hasn't had a microchip developed for it, on the MacBook's GPU, if you can find a piece of GPU mining software that supports OS X.

You can have multiple, segregated accounts if you all use different "Temporary Passphrases". See [the documentation]( You'd all share a PIN and a single no-password wallet, and to use your personal wallet you would add your password as a temporary passphrase.
It looks a bit awkward, though. With something Trezor-based I think you can use unique passwords more easily. When configured to use a password, the actual hardware only validates the PIN, and just happily accepts any password you give it, producing a unique wallet for each.

You forgot to account for the fact that the blocks are coming at half speed. If we lost half the hashpower, not only would we only be able to handle half as many transactions per second, but also the retargeting system would take twice as long to do retargeting. So we'd be at half capacity for (assuming we have to wait the full retargeting period) **four weeks**.

Basically, the USB thing has an accelerator chip that can do the mining computations really fast. The computer feeds it work to do, and takes its results and sends them out to the Bitcoin network.
Generally, since you're still competing with the entire mining world in a winner-take-all game, you will also participate in a mining pool, where you all send your results to a central server, and the server pays everyone for their mining work (based on the number of near-misses you produce, which prove that you are actually mining).

Well the last time there was a high-profile crime on Ethereum, the whole community, under the leadership of the Ethereum founders and the Ethereum Foundation, deployed a hard fork to move the stolen money back to its rightful owners.
If I was a cybercriminal, I would think twice about keeping my ill-gotten gains on that chain.
Neither the Bitcoin Foundation nor any other group in the BTC space has that kind of influence, and the community, as evidenced by the Scaling Kerfuffle, lacks that kind of unity.

Prediction markets have sadly failed to step up to the plare for important stuff like this.

If you have the keys for the coins, you can make a transaction moving them and broadcast it to either forked network. (Though if you do this you might want to take some kind of technical steps to make the transaction not also be confirmed on the other network, if you want the coins on both forks to go different ways.) While your wallet might not support both forks, you can always take the keys to a different wallet that does.
If you just have a promise for someone to pay you the coins when you withdraw them, you might only get paid on the network that the person who promised to pay you decides to use.

Coinbase works, unless you trip their somewhat paranoid suspicious-activity detectors. They will want a lot of personal info, including scans of government identification. They also charge high-ish fees. But if you equate "trusted" with "bank-y", it's hard to get more trusted than them.
In Europe, Bitstamp looks like it's pretty easy to get money into.
Localbitcoins, where you meet random people and exchange cash for BTC, is what lots of people here swear by, mostly because it's more private.
Once you *have* Bitcoin, if you want to exchange it for various other things, Bitsquare is a decentralized online exchange you can use. But as a decentralized online system it can't accept normal money.

How about this: Don't talk to cops who think you may have done something wrong. Cops aren't just wandering down the street looking to slap handcuffs on the first person to say hello, and if you call 911 to report a burglary or something the cops are unlikely to try and arrest you.
Of course, if you did a crime, it's a bad idea to talk to cops about it, because you might let something slip, or you might just make them think about you more and figure out that it was you that did it. The same goes if you didn't do a crime but plausibly could have. But if you're talking about a crime that you are obviously on the victim end of, and the cops don't hate you for some other reason, you should probably talk.
Since the OP is clearly not the operator of Bitcoin-24, they can probably talk to the police about the possible crimes committed by Bitcoin-24 (assuming the police don't decide that Bitcoin is so weird that using it must be somehow illegal).

I'm not sure they'd go with an attack on random Windows users, especially one that requires them to mass-deploy a Windows trojan. If they do have a back door in Windows, they're going to save it for something more important than this.
If they do want to keep Bitcoin from succeeding, they'll probably focus on taking down major Bitcoin sites. They probably don't want to/can't just regulate them out of existence (being the NSA and not a real regulatory body), so they'd hack them and steal the coins from there. It's way stealthier and harder to pin on the NSA for Mt. Gox to suddenly lose all its coins than for *every Windows user* to suddenly lose all their coins.
I'm not really sure the NSA has an interest in keeping Bitcoin down though. They aren't the IRS, they don't care about some barely plausible libertarian future where nobody pays taxes. Just because Bitcoin users are mad at the NSA this week doesn't mean the NSA is mad at Bitcoin users. Bitcoin is great for them; they can fund things without writing checks signed "The NSA", and they can surveil every transaction just by watching the blockchain. If they want metadata to analyze, Bitcoin has loads of it.

Bitcoin is *probably* legal under any label that plausibly fits. However, the question of how to interface it with the rest of the legal system depends fairly heavily on what we decide it is. If you trade Bitcoins and make a bunch of USD, for example, how would you report it on your taxes? Is it capital gains on an asset? Is it a gift from the exchange? If you mine and sell Bitcoins, is that income the same as if you mine and sell gold? Or is it a gift from the Bitcoin network? Or is it found money?
You *could* avoid this by keeping all your money in Bitcoin and never telling the IRS, but that's really inconvenient if you need to buy groceries.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:03:16
Mostly it's not getting bamboozled if your peers try to send you a fake blockchain. If you're mining you can feed this lack of bamboozlement back into the system by making the longest valid chain longer, but if you're not it really only protects your client's view of the network.
Of course, one could argue that having lots of verifying clients out there gives the current settings of the protocol some weight: if you're a miner and Bitcvoin-QT won't accept some weird thing you want to do in your blocks (maybe hiding data in bogus extra transactions?), while other implementations don't bother to check, then you're less likely to do it if people actually use Bitcoin-QT.
Then again, given that mining all happens on bitcoind, which is really Bitcoin-QT without the QT, maybe having it actually facing users is somewhat less important than it would otherwise be.

I was thinking about this the other day.

Unfortunately, the entire system needs to satisfy some other, conflicting requirements. You need to be able to prove to yourself that your vote was counted, so you can have confidence in the results. But you need to be *unable* to prove it to anyone else, to avoid extortion.

By "secret owner" I meant the holder of the private key for the address. One person can start amassing a stupidly large amount of money without anyone else being able to find out who it is. And if rich people don't need to worry about how they look when they spend their money, they might start spending it on bad things.
As for the will, you can perfectly well say "and all my bitcoins are bequeathed to my two daughters", but unless the private key is available to the executor of the will, they can't actually be given to them. And if you do put your private key somewhere where a will executor can have access to it (maybe in a safe deposit box in a bank), Bitcoin becomes more complicated to use: you need to pay to rent a safe deposit box in a bank, you need to keep your list of private keys up to date, you need to amend your will so that people have any idea what bank to find your private keys in, and so on. And your funds are only as secure as the key escrow mechanism you have chosen.
These precautions aren't just for the old and super-rich either: if you're 25 and die in a skiing accident, you don't want your grieving parents to lose out on your $10k Bitcoin stash, do you?

Generally you don't memorize the private key, because it's long. You memorize a passphrase that decrypts an encrypted private key (which you then need to keep a potentially public copy of). You can also generate the key directly from the passphrase, but I don't think the normal Bitcoin client will do that for you.

It has a fairly similar peer-to-peer network protocol (INV messages and so on). It uses Bitcoin's fancy variable-length ints. It doesn't use the important part of Bitcoin (the blockchain).

Ideally, we should be selling BTC for credit card USD.
How do big companies like Amazon deal with credit card chargebacks? They obviously suffer from sort of the same problem: anyone can buy something, claim "it never arrived", and do a chargeback. Are their profit margins high enough that they can just eat that cost and ban those users? Do they have some sort of relationship with the credit card companies where their word and some sort of proof of shipment can trump that of a customer?
EDIT: Perhaps being difficult to get helps to keep the value up. Something that you can't have automatically seems more valuable than something that's just a couple clicks away.

You can learn a lot about the statistics of passwords in the wild by looking at passwords that get leaked and released. So if, say, 75% of people used padded passwords, and 25% of people used other types of passwords, you would be able to find out those general statistics.
I stand by my assertion that a longer password with less entropy is less secure than a shorter password with more entropy.
However, padding a password will always make the password you started with more secure than it was originally. So there is that.

They took down the servers, so presumably they just read them from whatever configuration files the servers read them from in order to automatically process withdrawals.

You could also make the point that movements of coins on the blockchain don't necessarily correspond at all to movements of value. For example, many people deposit and withdraw from exchanges, and are unlikely to get the "same" coins back that they put in.
You could, in addition to that, work on trustless mixing features for the default client, to be enabled by default. Basically, the client could go out and find other clients and exchange equal amounts of coins with them with 2-signature transactions.

Well, the law may define "Money Transmission Business" a bit more broadly than what it appears to mean. The C&amp;D says that "any network of people who engage as a business in facilitating the transfer of money domestically or internationally outside of the conventional financial institutions system" has to register. If you accept that developing or promoting Bitcoin is "facilitating the transfer of money" (which is probably true: Bitcoin makes transmitting money much easier), and that the Bitcoin Foundation is doing this "as a business", (which is debateable: who are the paying customers?), then they would be required to register.

That assumes that each Bitcoin can only be traded once per year (or whatever time period you are valuing global trade over) and that all Bitcoins are traded every year.

I don't think the Bitcoin community is less welcoming to women than other male-dominated communities. The problem is that the men who are dominating the community generally have no idea how to not make the place unwelcoming to women. So we get stuff like this.
But I disagree with your assertion that we can't make the Bitcoin community more welcoming to women without having to fix the whole culture all at once. The most important thing to change would be to get the community to stop thinking of itself as male-dominated. It's not that Bitcoin users are generally men, it's that there are a lot of Bitcoin users, many of whom, sort of incidentally, happen to be men. Not a difference of facts, but a difference in how the facts are interpreted.
Things like this bet do the opposite of that.

I have a question:
I've read elsewhere that if you bought coins at a low price (say, 1 BTC at $10), or even mined them, and then spent them on goods and services when they were more valuable (say, at $100), then the excess value of goods and services that you received for the coins, over the money that you put in, would be taxable as capital gains, even though the coins were not sold.
Now obviously the IRS is unlikely to pick up on a couple hundred dollars of stuff from bitcoinstore.com being shipped to your house, but, theoretically, is this how capital gains taxes are supposed to work? What happens if I trade someone Apple stock for their car? Same idea, right?

And it's so close to valueless that nobody's going to bother trying to steal it, and you can hand it out like candy.

I'm going to argue with stock_blocker on the mining. On the one hand, with purpose-built Bitcoin mining chips coming out, mining won't make you much money. On the other hand, if you have free electricity and a recent ATI GPU, it's free money (at the cost of the environment, obviously), and every little bit of mining improves the security of the Bitcoin network. Mining is also a great way to understand how and why the Bitcoin system works under the hood.

Not quite "stuck in the middle", but yes; it could be that after the hash rate drops by like 99%, it starts to take 100 times as long, on average, for anyone to find a block, so 6 confirmations takes 600 hours, and the problem isn't rectified for 100-200 weeks when enough blocks are found for a difficulty adjustment to happen.

There are some altcoins that do try to address the problem of wealth disparity, or at least of currency distribution. Devcoin, for example, is structured such that some generated coins go to miners, and some go to people who contribute to open-source projects, or make art, or something (I'm not all that clear on the details). And I think Freicoin has "demurrage" to discourage people from holding on to the currency.

Social and regulatory technologies are technologies too.
If you did enough volume and charged enough fees, you could make all the transfers to exchanges directly via bank wire. If you hired a real accountant and a real lawyer and had all the appropriate government licenses and collected all the appropriate social security numbers, you could ensure that you were legally in the clear.
The real problem is that doing such a business in a fully regulation-compliant way is prohibitively expensive, and that the information you would have to collect from your customers (and the premiums you would have to charge to protect yourself from chargebacks) would scare away all the customers.

To the top with you.
1 FLOP is 1 floating-point operation per second: an add/subtract/multiply/divide on a floating point (essentially, scientific notation) number. Something like 1.3 * 1E-12.
The Bitcoin network is all hashing. Hashing involves only integer math. Things like 12345 + 93218. While the Bitcoin network does an awful lot of integer operations every second, it does no floating point math at all. Even Bitcoin amounts are integer numbers of Satoshis.
Those fancy mining ASICs everyone just bought? They can't do any floating point math at all.
So, the Bitcoin network clocks in at 0 FLOPs.

Do you think that the fact that mining is nowhere near profitable is a good thing or a bad thing for the currency?
On the one hand, a profitable mining industry creates powerful people with a vested interest in the future of the currency, and who can afford to maybe compete with at least some smaller nation-states in terms of hash power.
On the other hand, a currency operated by a community of hobbyists is much more difficult to control.

There are two types of orders: limit orders and market orders. Market orders are the ones you really want to use, because you get to pick the price. Market orders go into two "queues", the bid queue and the ask queue, and get sorted by price. To really understand how order matching works, you want to look at something like this:
The yellow line on the left is the total size of bids in the bid queue at or above a given price. The blue line on the right is the total size of asks in the ask queue at or below a given price. When you place a limit order, it sits in the queue until all the people offering better deals than you get their orders filled, and someone takes you up on your offer. If the price moves the wrong way, and doesn't move back, your limit order may never get filled at all.
Notice how where the two lines meet in the middle, they both go to 0? That's because, if there's ever a bid and an ask at the same price, or a bid at a higher price than the lowest ask, they get matched, a transaction happens, and the orders (or at least as much of them as got filled) are removed from the two queues. (If the bid price is higher than the ask price, the exchange gets to pocket the difference. Free money!) Moreover, the price used in this transaction beciomes the "market price" of Bitcoins on the exchange, until the next transaction happens. 
Since the lowest ask and highest bid are not at equal prices, there is some distance between them (the "spread"). When you use a limit order, this works in your favor: you're selling at the high end of the spread and buying at the low end of the spread, if you buy or sell at all. When you use the other type of order, a market order, you're getting a worse deal. Instead of market orders going into the queue, the best available matching orders of the opposite type are chosen, and you pay or get whatever price they were at. So if you buy 10 BTC at market price, the lowest-priced 10BTC of ask limit orders are pulled off the queue, and you pay whatever the sellers were asking, which is on the high end of the spread. If, instead, you placed a limit order to buy 10 BTC slightly below the spread, and it got filled as the market price fluctuated up and down, you would have waited longer and paid less. But if the market fluctuated the wrong way, you might have missed your chance to get any Bitcoins at all for anywhere near what the market price used to be. So it's always a bit of a gamble.

Short answer: no.
Long answer: No, wallet addresses are public keys, and you have a private  key stored in your wallet that you use to send coins sent to the private key. Unless you randomly rolled someone's private key, you can't get their address.
There's also no such thing as "canceling": if you abandon your Bitcoins and delete your wallet, those coins are gone fore good.

OK, I've found your problem and it's my fault. This is a *Ruby* script, not a *Python* script as I initially thought. They look vaguely similar, and I've been programming in Python constantly for months, and I didn't see what I was looking at.
What you actually want to do:
1. Make sure you have Ruby installed. OSX since Tiger I believe has shipped with it by default, so you probably do. If you can run "ruby" in the terminal and not get an error, you have ruby.
2. Figure out how you run bitcoind on your system. If you don't get some sort of not found or bad command error when you run "bitcoind" from the terminal, then Terminal already can find it and you're done. (In that case, remove the "./" in front of bitcoind in the script.) If not, you probably have to open up your Bitcoin installation (if it's a proper Mac app (which is really a special folder), you have to open it in Finder as described [here]( and poke around until you find a file called "bitcoind". You want to copy it out of wherever it is and drop it in your home folder (the one that contains your Libraries folder and so on).
3. Copy the script and save it as "script.rb" in your home folder. Change the oops to what you remember your password being. (If it's quite long, the script may not work very well, as it puts all possible passwords in memory before trying any.) If specified above, remove the "./" from in front of bitcoind.
4. Make sure the Bitcoin GUI app is not running.
5. Open Terminal. You start in your home folder, so you can run "./bitcoind" or just "bitcoind" (whichever is appropriate) to start up bitcoind. Let it run. If it complains about an RPC user password and a configuration file, just make the file it asks for with the contents it specifies and run "chmod 600 &lt;name of file&gt;" to make it only readable by you.
6. Open another Terminal window and type "ruby script.rb" to run the script.
Let me know if you have any issues.

Mostly it's not getting bamboozled if your peers try to send you a fake blockchain. If you're mining you can feed this lack of bamboozlement back into the system by making the longest valid chain longer, but if you're not it really only protects your client's view of the network.
Of course, one could argue that having lots of verifying clients out there gives the current settings of the protocol some weight: if you're a miner and Bitcvoin-QT won't accept some weird thing you want to do in your blocks (maybe hiding data in bogus extra transactions?), while other implementations don't bother to check, then you're less likely to do it if people actually use Bitcoin-QT.
Then again, given that mining all happens on bitcoind, which is really Bitcoin-QT without the QT, maybe having it actually facing users is somewhat less important than it would otherwise be.

What they *do* control, by virtue of running all the verifiers, is the XRP cost of various actions.

Bitcoin will be fairly useless as a currency until the price settles down. As a system, Bitcoin was more valuable when it was at $5 for several months than it is right now.

Bitcoins don't need to be real to be money. Money has never really been real, we just used to use physical counters for it.

I don't think it rescues failing currencies; they often come with failing governments.

I think the Bitcoin value floor comes from its utility as an Internet toy. You can send them to people and there's an air of cryptographic security about the whole process.
This is different from it being a medium of exchange, since nobody has to actually value the points to have fun sending them.
Put another way, even Monopoly money has value since you need it to play Monopoly.

This is a very real risk to Bitcoin. All it takes is one flaw in the protocol that doesn't have a super-easy fix like the selfish mining thing, or one exploited buffer overflow that steals everyone's coins, or the fall of one of the cryptosystems involved to make everyone need to switch to some altcoin not vulnerable to the attack.

They almost certainly have access to all the BTC that was in hot wallets.

It only really makes sense if you tend to have Bitcoin sitting around for other reasons (you got paid some for something), or if you just think Bitcoin is fun (and are willing to pay a premium to buy stuff with it), or if the merchant really likes or suits the irreversible, semi-secret, automate-able transactions (like for a super secret VPN or one of those "pay-this-webpage-ad-get-a-service" setups).

That's a big difference. A large portion of exchange transactions indicates buy-in and potentially a bubble. A large portion of block chain transactions indicates use and organic growth and actual value.

I'm sorry to complain, thank you for all of your free work, but I'm a computer expert and I can't install an Open Transactions client. There's Moneychanger, but it depends on having the server installed, which on Windows depends on this OpenSSL distribution that I'm not even sure if I got the right one of, and which itself depends on a different Microsoft C++ runtime than the OT server, at which point I gave up and went back to using Bitcoin-QT, which I can simply download and install.
Open Transactions sounds like a great idea, but it's useless as money with such high barriers to entry.
Is there any way to port Moneychanger to pure Java?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:24:41
That could very well be it. I only installed x64 OT, since I thought I only needed x64 OT for my x64 system. I will try following your very detailed directions from your other comment and let you know how that works out.

So I don't just navigate to the folder and hit the affirmative button in the dialog? How do I tell it to add the folder to the Java path?

Can you support this assertion at all? While cops can be pretty terrible to people when they think they've done something wrong, they are not in general trying to cause problems for everyone they speak with.

I think having the SEC step in and do their job increases Bitcoin's legitimacy.
If you want to run a Bitcoin-denominated scam, you'd better use those anonymity features, because if you don't the people I employ in my government to prosecute scammers are going to prosecute you.

When the changes constitute the transfer of money, and you've empowered your government to regulate that transfer.
Just because something is unjust doesn't make it incomprehensible nonsense.

I would not describe localbitcoins as "safe". You have to meet people from the Internet. Sometimes they pay you counterfeit money or try to kill you.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:41:48
Alt coins are mostly toys, not real money. Open up the Dogecoin client, admire the Comic Sans, and then ask why Real Businesses wouldn't want to be involved with it.

What's the adoption rate of smartphone devices that can actually store and transmit BTC vs. feature phones which presumably can't?

How secure are palm scans for verifying someone *isn't* the person with the palm on file? What if they use both their hands? Or draw on their hand with a sharpie or something?

I will gladly voluntarily pay my taxes so that my local strongman can protect me from idiots with Bitcoins who feel they don't need to follow health codes/building codes/prohibitions against murdering me and taking my stuff.

Do they just not want to bother processing transactions in a way that complies with Indian law? Or did India ban their service?

I'm involved with the [Santa Cruz Meshnet Project]( which is part of Project Meshnet.
Unfortunately right now the whole thing is mostly running as an overlay network on the real Internet, so it's nowhere near being ready to swing into action keeping Bitcoin running if the Internet shuts down.
However, the software we're using (cjdns, which has nothing to do with DNS) can run over any wired or wireless links you can cobble together, so if someone were to start stringing cat5 cables across the country we could in theory just plug them in.
There are a couple of Bitcoin nodes running on the network that you can connect to, and that bridge to the Internet. Any IPv6 Bitcoin implementation ought to be able to talk to them.
Perhaps most importantly, almost anyone connected to the network will probably accept Bitcoins, and many people have some to spend. A Kickstarter-alike to fund a cjdns port to routers [raised almost $20,000, mostly in Bitcoins]( (The promised hardware has yet to show up, but I'm sure we can all relate to that.)

It's still in the protocol, and has to be, because it's used for newly generated coins. Gavin isn't the Lord and Master of the currency, so it will probably come back if people ask for it.
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:37:41
But Botcoin is fundamentally a consensus-based currency. If you have enough of the economy behind you, you can change how it operates simply by releasing a new version of the software and declaring it to be the new way that Bitcoin works.

OK: every account must be verified through the existing AML process before it can trade. No more fake accounts. Happy?
