Im not sure where you're from, but in the US that's not typically the case. Most people are in debt due to student loans or medical bills. Two services that are free or affordable in many countries. Having such a large portion of the population in debt is incredibly bad for the economy. Nobody has disposable income. Nobody has money to save or invest. Some people are at fault for trying to keep up with the Jonese, but most debt is from corrupt industries that are exploiting our population and our economy for their own benefit.

It remains to been seen whether Bitcoin will be successful with micropayments. However due to its unique economic incentives and the scarcity of its fixed supply, Bitcoin has proven to be an excellent store of value - which is somehow viewed as a failure rather than the remarkable accomplishment that it is.
 Bitcoin has the pptential to become a global unit of account for which all nations measure the value of their currency against. Of course this has already happened with other cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin as a reserve currency that underpins the global economy is more interesting to me than Visa 2.0. With that being said, I truly hope the lightning network succeeds in scaling Bitcoin and allowing for micropayments, but I don't believe Bitcoin's success depends on it.

Higher volume, not higher price, results in higher fees. Price and volume are often correlated but a higher price doesn't "cause" higher fees. The price of Bitcoin could be 10x higher but that doesnt mean the volume and fees will also be 10x higher, especially if it's being used as a store of value.

I agree, but to be fair something very similar happened to Bitcoin in 2013 when the blockchain accidentally forked due to a bug and all it took was a few mining pools colluding to reorganize the blockchain.

You don't need modern standards of morality to know that systematically murdering an entire ethnic group is wrong. At the time he was alive, there were people in the US harshly condemning the genocide and slavery that Andrew Jackson carried out.
The argument you're using is typically  applied by those who sympathize with authoritarian state power. At the time slavery existed in the US, there were a number of people writing about how cruel and inhumane it was. To believe there was a time in US history when genocide and slavery were universally viewed as morally acceptable is completely wrong.

Removing ASICs would greatly reduce the hash rate, weakening Bitcoin's security and immutability. There is always a trade off.

I appreciate it! I'm not saying capitalism is defined by inflationary practices, but every capitalist country in the world has a currency created and regulated by the state that experiences inflation. That's a fact. I dont think it's possible for a state currency (like the USD) to ever exist in a market free from the state. 
I dont think most libertarians understand how deeply intertwined states, currencies, and markets have always been. I mean, just look at a dollar bill... It has the image of the state stamped on it. How can you expect that to exist in a market free from the state? It literally belongs to the state. It's a product of the state. Bitcoin is the first time in modern history that a global currency has existed outside of the state.

It has less volume and it's more volatile in both directions. When the price drops, BCH typically drops harder. When the price goes up, BCH typically gains more. If you've been following the ratio over the past year or so it almost always exhibits this behavior when there is a major price movement.

Right. I do agree with you. The network is useless if it's not decentralized. I just want to point out that Bitcoin very much derives its immutability from the hash rate. If the network was decentralized but only 5 CPUs were mining Bitcoin, it would be very easy to reorganize the blockchain. What makes reversing transactions so difficult is the fact that you would need to perform the work for every single block you want to change, which at the current hashrate would require an unimaginable amount of computing power.

Have you read "Debt: The First 5,000 Years"? I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in the topic.

What is your basis for assuming the number of nodes is proportional to the number of users?

This would be a better meme if the bottom included actual reasons to buy Bitcoin: "Digital scarcity, decentralization, immutability, censorship resistance, borderless, permissionless"

No I think it's off-chain

Did they stop teaching graphs in school? Lol

College debt is crippling the entire US economy. It's asinine.

Some people are both, like Tim Draper.

Literally nobody considers ETH a shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-13 04:21:18
Make sure to cite your sources young fella.
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:18:10
OP didn't say anything about future performance. People are so used to mocking prediction charts (understandably) that they didnt even notice that this chart isn't making any predictions. It's a historical record.

Sweet deprecating asset. Imagine how much BTC you would have by waking everywhere and only consuming rice and water. Big mistake bro. Big mistake.

The number of full nodes doesn't affect the hasrate. The hashrate is determined by the collective computing power of everyone mining Bitcoin.

I'm thinking about starting a food truck called Shitcoin Tacos. We would only accept coins outside the top 100. Would anyone be interested? I'm trying to gauge my market.

January is an arbitrary point to measure from.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:10:03
This is absolutely correct. Hash follows price. I'm not sure why this is being downvoted, as it's a pretty widely accepted truth. There is typically a significant delay because it takes time for companies to manufacture and sell ASICs, but when the price of Bitcoin increases the demand for Bitcoin mining equipment increases. When the price decreases the demand for mining equipment decreases.

Stop flaunting your wealth. Nobody likes a show off.

True but a tax that disproportionately affects lower income people. The wealthy keep their money in stocks, bonds, and real estate, which successfully shields them from inflation. People who live pay check to pay check and dont have the ability to utilize traditional investment vehicles experience the full effects of their diminishing spending power.

How is writing faster than typing for you??
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:47:03
Indeed. A bubble free of toxic trolls who call ETH a shitcoin. You're welcome to live here too once you grow up a little.

I see you mining and grinding on the blockchain,
I know you see me with my ledger and you already know,
I wanna hold you, hold you, you already know...

Excellent chart. Well done!

CMC is verified on the Brave Browser. I contribute BAT to the site every month and don't see any ads. It's the best of both worlds!
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:35:06
Right. I'm responding to a comment that said BTC isn't in a bear market because it's up 200% since January.
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:34:53
I don't care what they sell, I would walk in that store and buy something. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:21:53
What neighborhood?
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:43:16
Good point!

Think about the opportunity cost. That time would be better spent earning fiat and converting to BTC. Or better yet investing in your future by learning a new skill like programming.
@_date: 2019-05-05 03:16:12
Right. There are a ton of public figures in the crypto space with immense amounts of crypto, publically known wallets, known reddit accounts, twitter accounts, company info, ect ect. Don't give away your private keys. Keep your crypto in cold storage. It's not that complicated. All the paranoia just scares away newcomers.
For example, everyone knows how much ETH Vitalik has and everyone knows his Reddit account. Do you think he's worried?

Just because a political party claims to be communist does not mean they actually are.
It's an important distinction to make. Otherwise people become very confused about what communism is and isn't.
