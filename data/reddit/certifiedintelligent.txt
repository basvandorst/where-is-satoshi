The official exchange rate doesn’t reflect the actual worth of the currency. 
This is why a lot of idealistic people are in bitcoin, to avoid government shenanigans. 
Just because the government says the bolivar is worth .10USD doesn’t mean anyone will give you a dollar for 10. The Venezuelan government certainly won’t!
Check out dolartoday.com, the site that was sued by Venezuela for “falsely manipulating exchange rates” but in actuality reports the black market exchange rate, what someone will actually give you a dollar for.

Mac malware isn’t unheard of, but it’s more likely you’ve used a malicious hotspot or the same username/password combination somewhere else. 
How much is you’re internet security worth to you? It should be worth as much as your online bank and crypto account balances. Thankfully it doesn’t cost that much. An occasional wipe and always using a VPN (I use PIA, it’s cheap and effective) are a very small price to pay. If you have a significant amount at stake, a dedicated and highly secured computer could also be prudent. 
But I digress. The point is someone got your password. If you don’t know where or how, the prudent thing to do is fix everything that could have been the cause. Is it worth that much to you?
As someone who wipes Macs fairly regularly, it’s super easy to set it up again. A good thing to learn. Once you have a clean install with just the OS and all the apps you use, make a backup of it. Then restoring from a wipe takes about 30 minutes tops with time machine. 
Also, get Sophos AV.  Either the Mac standalone version or the Sophos Home suite. Good AV system for OSX from a reputable company for FREE.

The IRS will want to know where the 50k went from his bank account, where it came from and went from yours, and where the BTC went from yours if you use an exchange. The withdrawal alone will get flagged by the IRS and any competent divorce judge will assume he’s hiding money when they find it in the bank account history if that’s really the case.

It's a bandaid, but it can never be the solution. While this one might not be seriously detrimental to the network, further expansion of the block size limit is going to cause the centralization of nodes and control of the network to whoever owns them. When you need a data center to be able to run a node and have a say in the network, the point has been missed long ago. Bottom line is that while this one may not be so bad, it gives precedence to using block size expansion as a solution which will eventually undermine the decentralization that bitcoin requires. Maybe it's never expanded again, maybe it never has a detrimental effect, for that reason, I plan on holding both forks. But the lack of replay protection leads me to believe that this is less about fixing a problem with bitcoin and more about taking over control as "the bitcoin", and I anticipate there being more attacks on decentralization down the road in an effort to consolidate control for profit. 
L2 scaling solutions will provide the expansion necessary to make bitcoin less painful to use. This is the long term solution, not just the bandaid that will need another in a few months.

Yes comma but...
In the latest "we caught China doing x" instance, the device affected was an entire server. The rogue chip had network access and the ability to modify commands as they were sent to the CPU. It basically had full control over the entire machine.
In the hypothetical case of a compromised hardware wallet, it is only the wallet device that is compromised. If you have adequate security measures on your computer, the device cannot unilaterally communicate to the outside world, nor can it modify the programming or really anything on the host computer without administrator access. 
You would have to combine a compromised hardware wallet with a compromised plugin or app that enables a remote connection to take place, even unilaterally. Or you just have to not care about security and install whatever pops up in your browser.
It would be far easier to get gobs of people to download a malicious wallet application or use an intercepted and pre-set wallet instead.
Addendum: hardware crypto wallets are small fish compared to major American economic powerhouses (and everyone else that used a compromised Supermicro server). The R&amp;D that went into this hack alone was most likely cost hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. You wouldn't get the same ROI on hacked hardware wallets.
Addendum2: Never assume your setup is secure. Always use defense in depth.

It already can be, but there are tradeoffs. 
The only way to identify your transactions is by connecting one to you. Then one can find every transaction ever connected to that one and link it to you, where you got bitcoin from, and where you sent it to. 
Now there are ways to interrupt this "chain of custody". For example, a tumbler will interrupt this chain and anonymize the trail from that point on, but it will again only take one transaction to associate the new chain to you. The blockchain is eternal.
If you wanted to be anonymous today, you would:
- Get your bitcoin from any source
- Use a tumbler to launder it all into a new address
- Use a tumbler to launder it to make every purchase
In this manner, there is a gap between every identifiable event, meaning your transactions can never be traced to you.
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:43:01

In a perfect coin? Sure. But the world isn't perfect.
- Any currency only has as much value as people are willing to trade it for, whether in other currency or in goods/services. 
- In order to be worth anything, it needs to be exchangeable for those other things. 
- In order to be exchangeable for those other things, it needs to be widely accepted at places that provide those things. 
- In order to be widely accepted, it needs to be allowed to interface with the *traditional banking system*, AT FIRST.
*Until* bitcoin, or any other currency, has inherent value (store of value) in itself, and not because it's worth X USD or whatever, it's acceptance will depend on people's ability to convert it to FIAT. That's the only value that the majority of the world understands right now, FIAT. Right now we're at "1BTC is worth $4000" when it needs to be "1 BTC is worth X kilos of rice" for that store of value to be understood and accepted.
Until that store of value in bitcoin itself is secure and stable, governments have near absolute power to legitimize/deligitimize the currency through regulations. After all, if the US said you're no longer allowed to trade BTC for USD, or that all digital currency transactions will be taxed at 25%, crypto will die. Regulations inevitably mean taxes because governments rely on taxes to govern and provide services to citizens. 
Best hope is that BTC (or some other coin) becomes so widely accepted that governments legitimize it and accept it and let it move freely. It will never be exempt from governments because governments will always want/need their share of the pie and have absolute power in the form of legislation. The second you become a criminal for using crypto, crypto dies. 
- If you're not able to exchange it for other things, it isn't worth any other thing.
- If it isn't worth anything, it has no inherent value.
- If it has no value, nobody will use it.
You can also never be truly anonymous forever because the blockchain records everything, forever. As soon as an address is tied to you through a bank account transfer or other means, they will be able to track everywhere that money goes. It's only a matter of time putting puzzle pieces together before they can trace it end to end unless you are VERY careful about anonymity and use some more extreme methods of protecting your privacy than "just using crypto".

Nothing. Literally nothing keeps them from seriously screwing up bitcoin through legislation. Look at Russia for example, they just severely curtailed the ability for private citizens to get it.

We don't know if it's needed yet. Segwit will speed up transactions, but we don't know if it will be enough. This can only be determined from tomorrow on. 
Core was explicitly excluded from the NYA, input not desired. Why is it the onus of catastrophe on them for not supporting a change that they don't see being in the best interest of bitcoin? They believe that Segwit plus higher layer solutions will provide necessary scaling to fix the issues at hand. Are they the most right (the best kind of right)? Dunno. But they've been above board so far, appearing to act in the best interest of users, and not acting in a way that would cause people to lose value or create disruption. Who's going to write code for S2x if it becomes majority rule? Who essentially takes over advancing bitcoin then? All we can do is wait and see. But the fact that the S2x party's actions hold potential to disrupt or destroy bitcoin doesn't make them seem trustworthy. The fact that some S2x supporter's actions include misleading (ElectrumX defining BCH as bitcoin mainnet) or harmful disinformation (Bitpay debacle) makes them seem malicious.
--- 
Imagine yourself driving on a two lane freeway with another car next to you. Both cars have very shitty breaks and cannot speed up or slow down. The other car wants in your lane no matter what and starts to merge into you. Do you:
- A. Continue as normal, possibly colliding if the other car doesn't stop
- B. Swerve away and collide into the barrier (create a hard fork implementing replay protection on core)
- There is no third option for core
Acting in the best interest of yourself, do you choose the option that *possibly* results in damage or the option that *definitely* results in you crashing?
Assuming the other car would have been just fine in their own lane, who caused the crash?
I'm not going to assume what's best for the network right now because Segwit hasn't activated yet. But getting in the habit of expanding block size as a bandaid solution will only increase centralization of nodes, which is the antithesis of a decentralized currency. As is letting miners decide on the direction of the coin, because they are inherently untrustworthy and will only act in a manner that enriches them regardless of expense to others. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:02:08
Miners will always follow the larger reward. It's a business after all. 
Where they need to decide is on S2x because it has a real chance to destroy everything if the hard fork goes through maliciously. Then they'd essentially be shooting themselves in the foot.

You might think that banks take deposits from people in order to loan that money out to others. And that's right, but not the whole story. You can sum this up as "deposits creating loans".
Banks are allowed to loan money out to others *in excess* of deposits they have on hand. The bank is now loaning out money that didn't exist before, which then gets deposited in the bank, in other words "loans create deposits".

These other coins are very similar to OTC penny stocks. They have no real value, no market cap, and no real world purpose for the most part. But because of that, some press, some rumors, and a few thousand dollars will pump the price up exponentially. Other people will see this and want to get in on the rise to make some money. The entire time, the original developers/buyers/pumpers will be selling and taking out what the new suckers are paying in. 
Once the original pumpers are gone, everyone else is left with a coin that has no real world use and nobody willing to buy it from them at such an expensive price.
This is why liquidity is an important thing. BTC could be worth 1 million dollars, but if nobody is willing to give you the cash for your coin, what use is it really?

It was more of a joke, but at the same time really isn't. Granted you can't shop for clothes with Big Macs (yet). 
Bitcoin is a currency, it's just not inherently valued as such. Most people only want bitcoin because it's worth $4000 and growing, thinking they'll make more $ off of it. It's almost more of a speculative asset at this point than a currency.

Delay it for a LONG while. Bitcoin is only valuable now because it can interface with the established banking system.

Remember, the majority of the population doesn't even know what Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is, much less want and know how to use it. Most people getting into it today are only here because they think they can make money off the BTC/FIAT exchange rate, not because they want to spend it at starbucks.

Disabled your Mac firewall
Disabled IPv6
Restarted your machine
After checking all that, go here: 
Towards the bottom is a field to enter your public IP address (get it from ipchicken.com) where it will tell you if your node is accessible or not. If it is, everything is fine. If not, there's still something in the way.

So what's your alternative to the current and emerging financial systems, considering that the current is controlled by the very elite few and the new are supposedly becoming so?
The point of Bitcoin is that no "few" has the ability to push their agenda on the whole. Granted this relies on consensus of node operators, but that's where the decentralization comes in. If enough people care about it enough to run a node, it is effectively run by the majority who act as a check on power towards those who would manipulate it for their own gain.
Complaining about L2 centralization is a moot point right now because L2 doesn't exist yet outside of testnets. Just like complaining about block size limits is a moot point right now because we don't know how well/poorly Segwit will solve the problem as it just came into use. Seeing the writing on the bathroom wall is ok, but should be a cautionary tale of things to look out for, not a doomsday prediction because the mayan calendar ended. 
Seriously though, BTC is the best reform we have at the moment that hasn't turned out to be a pyramid scheme scam to this point. What's your proof that the dark side has control? What's your suggestion for moving forward (not just back to good ol' government controlled FIAT. How'd that work out for Venezuelans?) and fixing or bettering the monetary system?

No government could effectively stop bitcoins from being traded, but they can prevent them from being used in their country. Very few can "kill" bitcoin.
Major economic powers, especially those with reserve currencies, could probably kill BTC by banning it from interfacing with the banking system. If you couldn't use it in the either US, Japan, China, EU, etc, it would probably die. 
Currency needs to be usable to be worth anything. If you can't use it, there's no point in having it.

So in the US we have this lovely thing called asset forfeiture, maybe you've heard of it in the news.
Basically, over the past few years, there have been a disturbing number of stories about how law enforcement agencies have seized assets from people's accounts for being *suspected* of some crime. Even after being PROVEN NOT GUILTY the cops/government still don't give back the money. And when they do it's only after long protracted legal battles which may or may not get back *all* of the money. Let me say that again, for being suspected of a crime you didn't commit, the government can take your cash or bank account and not give it all back after you're proven not guilty.
Here's a few of the big notable ones:
That's one example of how laws and regulations can screw innocent people. The financial system, despite having many positive protections, is out to make money, not to protect you.
We put money in the banks to protect it from theft and enable ease of use like credit cards and wire transfers. You used to be able to make money on deposits, but that doesn't really apply anymore.
If there were a secure, easy to use method of holding on to your own money without being subject to the potential shenanigans of the financial system or crooked government agencies, why wouldn't you use it?
The bottom line is that governments ultimately control how much your dollar is worth, and should they decide to, they can change it at any time and you don't have a say in it. See Venezuela for a great example: state-owned revenue sources dried up so the government started printing money in extreme quantity. The rate in 2010 was about 5 VEF to 1 USD. The actions of the government have diluted that value so much so that the real rate is now somewhere *above* 10,000 VEF to 1 USD. The government says it's somewhere around 10 to 1, but nobody is going to give you a dollar for 10 bolivars these days.

Coinbase works well enough for me and many others. If you use the GDAX side of the business, you won't have to pay the convenience fees. I've never had an issue with ACH transfers. I'd imagine there's a lot of concern about wire transfers due to the prevalence in wire fraud and lack of consumer protection, so just use the standard bank transfer option when making deposits. 
I've also never had serious problems using credit or debit cards. Only once did I have a transaction denied and the fraud department called me shortly after asking if it was legit since this is also a pretty popular form of fraud.

**Without replay protection**, if you spend one, you "spend" (lose) the other. Ex: Say BTX is a new fork that doesn't have replay protection. If I spend my BTC, I lose my BTX. If I spend my BTX, I lose my BTC.

GDAX and buying a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger Nano S)
With coinbase you're paying a transaction fee for the convenience of using coinbase. If you just move to the GDAX exchange, you don't have to pay those fees anymore, but you make transactions a little differently.
You will always pay the mining fee, but Coinbase charges you a lot more just for the point and click convenience.
Once you get your HW wallet set up and YOU'RE COMFORTABLE USING IT, transfer everything to it and HODL HODL HODL
That said, I still use coinbase to instantly buy the dips via my CC, it's easier to justify the fees when you make it back right away!

@_date: 2017-08-14 13:34:42
Hello you are you me?
I bought ETH at ~320 2 months ago and it proceeded to crash immediately, I'm almost back to breaking even on it. I also bought bitcoin at ~2300 on the 12th only to be followed by a 4 day $500 dip.
I've given up on reacting to prices a while ago and just transfer everything I buy to my Trezor immediately. Lots harder to hit the sell button once it's stored in a hardware wallet.
You're not the only force of financial nature out there. :)
If you're ever considering selling due to a dip/dive/recession/whatever just look at the DJIA in 2008. So many people lost half the shirt off their back because they sold off. If they would've held, they'd have gotten all their money back a few years later, sooner if they'd bought the dip once it started recovering.

At least some of that blame rests with the parents who taught Millennials that those were the right things to do.
My parents pretty much brainwashed me into going to college. I wanted to enlist in the Army, they taught me I was going to hate life and be a failure if I didn't have a degree. Thankfully I got the military to pay for most of that degree (via ROTC), but *still* had 20k in debt after college.  
It boggles my mind how more people aren't clamoring for military jobs. After ~5 years as an army officer, I'm making ~$90k/yr with full benefits including 100% paid healthcare/dental, and am working towards a pension. If you can put up with the military bullshit and the occasional trip to someplace you may get shot at, it definitely beats living paycheck to paycheck or being unemployed.
Even enlisted can start saving money while having their basic needs paid for. Sure you're going to be treated like a child for a few years, but once you make NCO, life gets better. But you still get the benefits from day 1. 
Then add the GI Bill, tuition assistance, re-up bonuses, SCRA, benefits and discounts from companies...
But the military still can't achieve its recruiting targets...

From blockchain:




There's no reason that you need to use a new address every time. Many wallets do it by default. Some allow you to reuse addresses in the wallet while others don't. **HOWEVER** comma, just because the address doesn't appear again, doesn't mean you can't use it. I'm 99.9^9 % sure that if you keep sending bitcoin to one of your addresses, you will still see your balance grow.

Coinbase has convenience fees. It’s easy to use and they charge for that. 
Think about it though, you paid 1% fee for buying instantly and easily. One percent. In the grand scheme of bitcoin, that’s nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:42:22
You're missing how the fee structure works.
The fee is NOT high or low based on the fee/amount ratio. The fee IS high or low based on the fee/byte ratio.
Since your transaction has a number of inputs (different private keys you're sending from), the size of the transaction is pretty big. In the case of larger sized transactions like this (and without SegWit) what you paid is actually a low fee.
If you had a small sized transaction, say with only one input, $8 would be a pretty high fee with fast confirmation. 
So, for next time: use segwit addresses, don't spread small amounts over a lot of different addresses, learn how bitcoin works before you get fleeced by your own ignorance. 
This was actually a big headache a while ago where people had a lot of "dust" (realllllly small amounts per address) laying around that wasn't really redeemable because you would pay more in fees than the amounts were really worth.

You must **always** verify the addresses. There is malware out there that changes the key you copied to something else. Even if malware isn’t involved, the key you’re copying could NOT BE CORRECT. 
Last week my computer failed to verify with my Trezor. The wallet site showed me an address, but a completely different address appeared on the Trezor. It had an error about being unable to validate, so I moved to another PC and made the transfer after successfully validating. 
Always always always verify the key you’re using with what shows on your Trezor. Copy and paste is fine, but you’d better read that key letter for letter to make sure it’s where you want to send your money to. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:08:48
I use my credit card on Coinbase to buy the dips instantly. If I waited for the bank transfer, I’d miss them all!
Don’t worry about the fee. Bitcoin swings 1.5% regularly, so that fee is only a slight adjustment and will be recouped shortly. 
The only thing you have to worry about is your card issuer flagging you for fraud thinking someone stole your card. I got that call once and told them I would be doing it again, haven’t had any issues since and have a LOT of CC points.

Hence the gray area. In this case, with current legislation, you would pay cap gains twice if you went USD&gt;BTC&gt;ETH&gt;USD, assuming you made money on both BTC and ETH.
Neither BTC nor ETH are currency, therefore if you make money on them you pay taxes on the gain. Since they aren't currency, you don't actually trade BTC for ETH either, but BTC for an agreed dollar value of ETH.
This is why the legal classification as *currency* is so important. Property is taxed. Currency is... currency. You don't pay taxes on EUR&gt;USD&gt;YEN&gt;Whatever.
This is why this legislation is damaging in the long run because it relegates bitcoin to something like gold. You can use it some places (pawn shops mostly), but it isn't currency, is converted to a dollar value before buying something with it, and therefore cap gains taxable. 
By allowing transactions tax free up to $600, congress appears to be working with and accepting bitcoin, but is still putting that shackle of "not-currency" on it.

- Transfers out to another bitcoin address are free.
- I'm honestly not sure about withdrawals because I've been hodling like Hodlor.
But yeah, free buying and transferring. I still use coinbase for buying the dips with my credit card, and yeah you do take a hit, but I couldn't have caught 3200 if I had to wait for a bank transfer. Then transfer the bitcoin to GDAX, then to my Trezor for free!

Let's assume you use coinbase. Remember all that intrusive verification you did to use the service? That's for compliance with KYC/AML (know your customer, anti money laundering) laws. It also means that any transaction you make is available to the IRS. Unless you got your bitcoin through localbitcoins or some other completely offline not-subject-to-IRS-monitoring method, you can assume the IRS knows about all the bitcoin you've bought. After that, the immutable blockchain is your cookie crumb trail that lets auditors, law enforcement, or anyone with a little free time trace your money.
Bank account &gt; Coinbase &gt; Trezor &gt; Wherever
Regardless of where you sent it to, the IRS will always know you bought it if you used a US compliant exchange. After that, it's really on you to prove you don't owe taxes on 5k/BTC because you sold it all yesterday at 3k/BTC.
Also on your question about sales tax, you don't have to worry about that because that's a seller liability, not a buyer liability. The reason you have both is because bitcoin is not a currency in the eyes of the IRS, it is property. Therefore you're essentially exchanging your BTC to an agreed upon dollar value when using it to buy things. Even most places that accept bitcoin aren't actually doing business in bitcoin as a currency, because they use a payment processor to get the dollar equivalent out immediately.

Nope. There are secure chips in good hardware wallets (trezor, ledger, etc) that are secure by design. The rpi isn't designed with a secure element in mind, so only the software would be preventing bad people from doing bad things to your wallet. Software is a lot easier to remotely hack than hardware (I would say hardware is impossible to hack remotely, but nothing connected to the internet is ever 100% secure). 
Bottom line: get a real hardware wallet. It's worth the peace of mind.

You will never escape regulation, especially with things like money. Taxes are the lifeblood of governments and banking, therefore they will fight tooth and nail to get what's theirs and survive.
Don't evade taxes.


The decentralization is in the fact that no government controls the currency, the users (node runners) do. Yes they can regulate its interaction with the government-controlled banking/money system, but they cannot fiddle with the currency itself like issuing more bitcoins, for example. There will never ever be more than 21 million. That isn't the case with FIAT.

Who decides on these rules? Who enforces them? Who deals with people who decide they don't want to play by them? Who defends you from the next society over that wants to impose Shariah law?
Because I'm pretty sure the answer to all those questions is some sort of government, even if you call it something else. And if the answer is nobody at all, everyone individually, then it will be ruled by whoever has the most land/food/water/strength/guns/ammunition/or family members.


What do you do with the people who don't want to follow your rules? Isn't there coercion there? 
How would you deal with people who don't have the means to survive and don't have the means to get it peacefully? Wouldn't they have to coerce others (war, robbery, violence) to give it to them or starve? 
Coercion will be around as long as greed is around, and greed has been around literally as long as sentient life has, *education system or not*. Even cavemen killed eachother over food. Even toddlers fight over toys.
Maybe our society is unique in the amount of excess we have, but greed has always been part of the human condition, government or not. How do you plan on weeding out a basic emotion? The Christians tried to do it through the fear of god, we do it via laws, how would you?

Only one month of gains has been slashed. It's happened before. It's made new ATHs before and will continue to do so. Bitcoin as a value game was never short term, if you can't wait a few years for results, you shouldn't be playing.

For that one word alone, it won't. I guarantee you as long as religion exists, your utopia will never come to light, and in the absence of government, violent conquering religions will take over the ones that believe in peaceful coexistence and things like voluntaryism.
And religion isn't going anywhere anytime soon unfortunately.

On the contrary, bitcoin is the solution and the map and the guide, it also happens to be popular.
The solution: a decentralized monetary system that is free from any one group or person's influence, is easy to use, and relies on majority of consensus of users in order to make changes to the system. It's not just a picture, because the developers actually created the solution and are actively participating in it's development.
The map: system exists &gt; system becomes popular &gt; system becomes stable independent currency. If system becomes more popular than FIAT, system becomes default financial system. 
The guide: The developers and contributors, who identify problems with the solution and make changes to it and the map, leading to a better overall end. The enthusiasts who actively participate in advocation, lobbying, and other activities to increase adoption and guide discourse.
Lastly, they have enough people who believe in their cause to actually participate in it.
You have a hazy outline of a supposed solution, no map, and certainly no guide, and are waiting for others to do the actual work.

This is a double edged sword in the long run. At first it seems great because we won't be hit with cap gains in 99% of transactions. Good news for mass adoption.
 But in the long run, it relegates BTC to the status of always being worth X dollars, not a true currency on it's own. 
For instance, if a business near an international airport accepted foreign currency for transactions, there's no worry about tax implications for expensive items. Bitcoin will never be a currency so much as a barter-able commodity.
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:56:59
Prior to any semblance of mass adoption, futures are just a tool to make even more stupidly large amounts of money by players big enough to manipulate the price and sentiment of bitcoin. 
It's too early, at least for shorting.

So quack/uneducated doctors and medicine men should be allowed to peddle substandard healthcare potentially harming or killing people due to non-regulation?
That sounds like it would turn into very few quality docs and a lot of hacks because training and education is not mandated, expensive, and scarce.

Every time you change BTC to anything else, that's cap gains (assuming your bitcoin is worth more than when you bought it). Hence this bill that says you aren't liable for cap gains on purchases made with bitcoin under $600. But that hasn't passed yet, so yeah, if you bought a bitcoin earlier this year for $2k and used it to buy a car for $4k, you owe capital gains.
After the bill passes, if you bought a $3 coffee with bitcoin, regardless of what you bought bitcoin at, you don't have to pay capital gains for that transaction.
Bottom line is if you don't want a nasty surprise from the IRS some day, you should be recording all your bitcoin transactions.

I don't believe I ever did. I'm simply curious how such a new system, being so desirable in your eyes, would solve the social ills that even our current one cannot.


But you didn't. Anywhere. Hence why I was asking further questions. You envision an ideal society but leave it to other "smarter people" to actually figure out how it would work. There were no solutions offered.


I don't believe I espoused offense anywhere in my questioning how your envisioned society would function. On the contrary, it was you that started off with the insults and name-calling.

So you're not opposed to government, just the current government in the US? Or just rich people who use their riches to influence others?
Is there a government on the planet you don't have an issue with?
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:09:01
**None.** 
In order to handle trades for money in the US, you have to comply with KYC/AML because the IRS classifies exchanges as "money service businesses". This goes for a lot of other first world countries with legit exchanges. Deliberately avoiding this is breaking the law, tax avoidance at the least, money laundering or money transmission in larger volumes. There have been a handful of people arrested for operating "bitcoin for cash businesses".
Though as a buyer, you have considerably less risk of anything like that. 
The only truly anonymous way to handle bitcoin is to buy AND SELL offline. Trying to deal with foreign exchanges is a good way to get scammed. Why sell offline? Because the instant you make a purchase with that bitcoin address, it is tied to you and can be followed through the blockchain unless you use something like a tumbler which is *literally* money laundering and is very suspicious to the IRS and FBI.
This is why things like OPENDIME are popping up because they can hold bitcoin, yet you can simply hand it to someone. Offline transaction complete. Still technically afoul of tax evasion and whatnot because *bitcoin isn't legally a currency*.

Oh I absolutely agree that our education system is broken beyond real repair and doesn't raise kids to become responsible adults.
I don't see how the eradication of government is the answer, however. Education (and healthcare) should be way up the priority list from where they are and teach kids personal responsibility, ethics, and citizenship (in the "be a good member of society" kind of way), but the federal government isn't responsible for the education bit. That's the states individually, and the people in control there are voted in by the masses. 
If those masses can't fix a system they have voting power in, I'm not sure I want a system with even less framework that those masses are responsible for voluntarily running and contributing to.

Bitcoin just needs to be considered a currency. This will come with time and mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:58:48
I'm just finding it difficult to separate from absence-of-government anarchy.
It seems that society would voluntarily agree to subscribe to certain views and laws and ways of contributing, but with the absence of a compelling force like federal or state law enforcement, people could also completely disregard others wishes and cause havoc. 
The very existence of clashing religions and cultures would cause widespread conflict because of the absence of a compelling force and consequences. Even with that force of law today people still kill and rape and steal. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:46:09
Despite the waste, you do realize that taxes pay for all the infrastructure and services you use on a daily basis right? Anarchy would fucking suck.
Bitcoin will hopefully eventually become recognized as a true currency, but that's years down the road. Right now the best thing people can do to bring that day about is to run a full node, use bitcoin to buy things, and tell others about it. 
You're never going to get true anonymity with evasion of taxes. Anything that provides such will probably be banned or regulated into obscurity. But you can get into the ground floor of a new financial system that isn't subject to complete government control and will be able to avoid such shenanigans and outsider influence once it becomes widely adopted. You'll probably make a bit of money along the way too.
No, bitcoin isn't anonymous, isn't unregulated, isn't a tax shelter. It is decentralized, is a promising new system, and is still very young. Once people start treating it as money and not a commodity to make money buying and selling then things will start to move very quickly.

Depends on who you bought your bitcoin from. If it's anywhere with records like coinbase, the IRS will get your transaction records, compare purchase prices to current prices, and probably tax you on that unless you have believable documentation that you lost it all before then...
They don't care if you don't have the cash either. Got a million in bitcoin and nothing in savings? You gotta find 300k to pay uncle sam somehow or you don't pass GO.
Really the trick is to do it now or soon before the IRS really gets up to speed on tracking bitcoin holdings and personal digital worth.
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:35:53
Ding! 
And not just keep a record of, but pay taxes on too when April rolls around.
Really what you're doing is "selling bitcoin for X". X could be coffee, a car, whatever. But since bitcoin is considered property instead of money, you have to pay capital gains on any *realized* gain. 
If I could sell TSLA stock for X, it would be the same thing (not that I would want to). I'm sure I could probably find someone to sell me their car in exchange for some shares of Tesla, and if the stock is worth more than when I bought it, I will "realize" a gain by getting more value out of it than went in, thus having to pay capital gains. If you just let your bitcoin sit, it could go to a million per BTC but that would be untaxed "unrealized" gain, until you sold it. Unless you're renouncing your citizenship, of course. Then the IRS has no problem taxing your unrealized gain because you won't be around to tax the actual gain later.
However, there's still a lot of gray area. If you bought bitcoin and kept it as bitcoin when moving it around, you shouldn't have any problems. But if you bought bitcoin and exchanged it for etherium, you could be subject to cap gains because you're "selling bitcoin for etherium".
Also, even WHEN/IF this bill is passed, you'll want to keep track of all your &lt;$600 transactions, because if you get audited, saying "I bought a lot of coffee with bitcoin" isn't going to cut it with the IRS when they ask where all those bitcoins they know you bought went.
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:11:23
Won't help. The US has this nifty thing called expatration tax. If you're worth enough (net worth &gt;$2mil or you paid over $140k in taxes the past 5 years) and you renounce your citizenship, the IRS automatically assumes you're doing so to avoid taxes and will slap you with whatever taxes they think you're trying to avoid. Basically, they'll calculate all your not-yet-taxed net gains and take your cap gains there.
If you're not worth enough, if they even smell bitcoin anywhere near your banking history, you'll likely be audited anyways.

There's the misunderstanding again. You haven't opened a door. You painted a picture of a very nice place. Problem is, if you want to get somewhere, you need a map, not a picture, and you've left it to anyone else to draw it.
I hope we do get there some day, to a place without a greedy, controlling elite and where everyone is good and nice to each other and nobody suffers from extreme inequality, but right now I'm actually trying to put out the fires that are burning the house we already have and making a little change from the inside. 
If you ever do get a revolution started with some actual, you know, plans for how to change things for the better, let me know.

The problem with tribalism is unless everyone decides against it at the same time, we kind of need to keep it. It's self perpetuating. After all, if we stopped violently embracing our values as a nation, some other less civilized people would come take what we have in a heartbeat. 
It's kinda the reason countries were created in the first place. To make a place that mostly fits how most people want to live. Now that the politicians have absolute power, though, it's kinda gone off kilter. It also used to be a lot easier to go somewhere else that fit the way you want to live. Sadly, also not the case.


Good luck with customs and immigration...
