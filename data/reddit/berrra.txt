So how does this scam work?
@_date: 2016-08-16 05:12:47
Buy a small amount of BTC for around $10-20 and play around with.
Have them stored on the exchange until you know ur wallet setup is working fine.
* Make some transactions to your wallet.
* "Accidentally" lose your wallet.
* Restore your wallet from your seed.
@_date: 2016-08-18 05:11:42
Hidden in the dark:








Not only is the conversion price more expensive than market price (+$15/BTC), they also add 2.5% and slam a permanent $10 fee on it too. No thanks. Buying bitcoin should be easy, not expensive.

The program is **vnstat**.
The output comes from running **vnstat --days**.
Everything besides that (font, text color, background color etc.) is done by the terminal that I'm "viewing the output with".

Nice job bro.
Also made a Bitstamp ticker in my "statusbar" as seen in the screenshot.
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:42:01
Was away for a week and my other services was mostly unused during this period which presented good numbers for how much bandwidth a full node is using.
I'd say about 99% of the traffic is for bitcoind.
**EDIT: Given the amount of downvotes, let me just clarify that I show this as unbiased raw data. Yes this is relatively large amounts of data due to the high amount of connections. I do not wish to discourage people running nodes, quite the opposite. If bandwidth limitation is a necessity for you, you can do so by limiting the amount of connections in the configuration file like a lot of people have pointed out.**
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:24:13
Yeah I understand that, but how does it actually work?

Can someone explain how this is decentralised?
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:32:12
I run other services on the server which use a lot of traffic. As stated in my other comment I was away for a week where these services where unused, therefor showing only the data used by the node.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:23:27
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:51:24
Softlink the datadirectory to a place on your NAS instead.
Remember that CIFS is bugged for whatever reason so use NFS.
Create a network share on your NAS and mount that as your ~/.bitcoin
That way you don't have to run the actual bitcoin daemon on your NAS, only store it (the blockchain) there.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:10:43
What is your own logic behind your decision?
Personally I wouldn't touch alt-coins at all.
@_date: 2017-02-12 09:31:06
In what way does the information on that ticker need to be secure?
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:46:36
Resilient? That's a bit of a stretch, it dropped 10% (so far).
Means 10% cheaper coins though.
@_date: 2017-02-10 23:01:01
Depends on the amount of connections to your node.
I use about 60GiB on 100 connections per day.
Last 24 hours I've had 124 connections pretty solid and it's up to 85GiB.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:06:16
correct, it's vnstat

I captured something similar on Bitstamp right before the order was changed/removed
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:42:41
Correct, 100 is reasonably excessive.
Server is on an uncapped 100/100 Mbit connection and I literally just want to MAX it. I did not expect this data to shine light on the issues with capped internet connections as much as it did, and like many people have stated there are ways to keep the numbers down by limiting the amount of connections allowed.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:23:51
The btc will be in limbo until the transaction gets deleted from mempool, then they will be available to you again.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:20:23
That couldn't have waited until the mempool cleared a bit? I'm thinking $30 worth of BTC couldn't possibly have been that urgent.

Paypal is a dumb fiat service that allows buyer to cashback transactions. So no one will sell you BTC over Paypal.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:08:50
It isn't a protocol issue. The problem is you are using the exchange's wallet as an intermediary.
They set the lowest fees possible and sure as fuck ain't using lightning.
So don't complain when you are using Bitcoin wrong.

Not that hard. The IRC protocol is very basic.
Combine that with one or several exchanges' APIs for the transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:17:38
You'll have to look at this from a ROI point of view.
In your case I would buy small every month, maybe $50 and just HODL. There is no "become a billionaire quick" for your situation. But your investment will be much higher than normal saving or investment alternatives.
With that said, diversifying your investment is never a wrong path either.
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:03:39
Where did you get the information that we purchase BTC to use as stable currency **today**?
Personally I buy BTC for the chance that they are worth a shit ton **some day in the future**.
So I don't give a fuck about 100% swings.
Look at this:  and note that BTC is trending, price will go up, nothing else matters by Metallica.

You sweep manually.
I.e you transfer the coins from your paper wallet to one of the trezor addresses through a normal transaction.
Booting a liveOS from a usb is a very good security measure and is good practice.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:54:10
Sounds like a pretty obvious scam.
Also why Paypal? Since cashback is possible the one who retrieves the fiat always gets scammed and you cant get your btc back.

If your lucky it clears when mempool gets low.
If your unlucky you need to wait 2 weeks for it to drop from mempool (you get the BTC back)

I tackled issues with the kernel kept killing of the bitcoind process.
Although this can be avoided, your system will be SLOW.
You can try to allocate swap space on your harddrive but I'm not sure how much this helps you. The bitcoind process is currently hogging 5.3GB of memory on my full node atm (not a raspberry). I'd love to hear if someone has a solution to the memory problem on the raspberry though.

@_date: 2017-08-06 09:14:07
Not sure. Depends on the amount he sells ofc.
Ask yourself what would happen if Bill Gates sold all his Microsoft Shares, the price would plummit cause that would send some dangerous signals. Why would the owner want to firesell all his shares?
Same thing I guess applies to Bitcoin. If the funder firesells it sends signals that he no longer believes in Bitcoin.
I don't see any other reason.
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:29:10
We already know Coinbase sucks, the question is why you are using them? Haven't you read the "reviews" here?
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:51:58
No you just have to review it once. Then have that version downloaded on a USB.
You can even someone else check the code and just confirm a checksum.
Same goes for the usb-storage, have it checksummed before u put it on USB and confirm checksum when u intend to use it.
You are overcomplicating things.
Bitaddress.org is just hosting the code. Take the code yourself from github.
EDIT: Pretty sure github also have some checksum tools to accomplish this as well.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:13:45
Perhaps include the txid so we can take a look???
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:11:14
You need 2 things.
1.) A good storage method. I personally recommend a hardware wallet like Trezor.
2.) An exchange you can trust. But just to be sure divide your trades so you only have a portion of USD on the exchange at any given time. BTC should immediately be transferred to your wallet. I've been using Bitstamp for quite some time with nothing but positive experience.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:21:29
Im guessing bitmain are buying to keep price up. Also not many exchanges hace opened up for trading so volumes are small afaict. Price will be corrected when people actually can sell their bch.

Sounds like you've started out in the wrong end, you've been sold the techie phone apps which in itself is not wrong. But you'd be better off learning the hard basics first.
I can recommend this video:
Regarding booting a liveOS from a usb-stick it's super fucking easy. We are talking MSpaint easy.
You litterally download an .iso or .img file and you "extract" that using certain tools onto the USB.
For windows you can use 
For GNU/linux you can use the **dd** program
 # dd if=/path/to/image.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:08:58
You can route your transactions through your node. Thats the best benefit apart from filling the actual relay function for the network. What do you mean more secure wallets? What would that even be?
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:22:52
Ah yes, a 4 page article (with minimal pages), of which 2 requires subscription, that covers all these points:
* Bitcoin is worthless.
* Separate Bitcoin from blockchain technology.
* Bitcoin is not digital gold.
* Bitcoin can never be a currency under its current model.
* Achieving legitimacy would defeat the very purpose of bitcoin.
What a fucking joke. Do you even have critical thinking?
You really think a whole new technology developed over 6 years can be minisculed into 4 fucking small pieces of shit and conclude the points above?
Please go somewhere else.

I can say from personal experience that buying a Trezor, if you consider having a considerable amount of BTC, is a real ease of mind.
I used to fiddle around with cold storage on a seperate computer which I installed linux on and then never connected to the internet with. Such a hazzle.
Trezor ftw.

The mempool is flooded because of an "attack".

I couldn't agree more. The network is working perfectly fine with a small adjustment of the fee. The problem like you explain are clients that don't have adaptive fees.

Reasons being, among others:

2. Pre-mined coins on altcoins.
3. Low adoption of altcoins.

@_date: 2015-07-10 13:08:49
People need to stop seeing the dust as a big problem. The dust was there because a person or a group of people was trying to make a point that the blocksize needed to be increased.
The aftermath of the dust showed something else though. It showed that the network handled it extremely well. The hiccups with transactions occured because of two things:
a) People were not aware they needed to set transaction fees accordingly.
b) Their wallet software did not propose that this was needed.
If wallet developers implement a simple mempool check and suggest a fee accordingly the dust will vanish, because there is no incentive to create dust to begin with (unlike e-mail spam).
You say that:


This is correct but it is taken out of context.
3 cents is *much* more than 2 cents (*50%* more) but it is still an irrelevant amount. And for 3 cents in this case the transaction will confirm next block.
That dust was able to fill up blocks just proves wallet software need adaptive fee's (or inform the user how to properly set the fee according to current mempool situations).
Blocksize will need to increase eventually but that time is not right now imho.
First sweep off the dust with adaptive fees. Then when blocks are actually full we can increase the blocksize accordingly.

Armory using one online system where you have a watch-only copy of your wallet (contains no private keys) and one offline system where you keep the "full" wallet.

@_date: 2015-04-20 18:07:11


Straight off the bat it sounds to me that you should read up some more. Play around with different wallets and learn their functions using small amounts of BTC.


**Until** you become comfortable using wallets and making backups the amount to invest should be kept to a few dollars at most. Just enough to play around with and definitely be willing to lose in the process of learning.
I've taken serious steps in terms of security and feel comfortable having about 10-20% of my savings in BTC.
EDIT: If you are curious on my setup I have a cold storage wallet (deterministic) using armory on an offline system with the seed stored in a safe deposit box. To supplement this I use a hot wallet on an online system (armory as well to serve along with the offline system).
You could even further supplement this with mycelium on a phone.
Good luck!

0.1mBTC is standard fee and ensures a swift transaction. This is not a mycelium fee, it's a fee on the protocol level.

**Damage to decentralization**
* Larger blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate.
* Therefore, larger blocks lead to less hashers running full nodes, which leads to centralized entities having more power, which makes Bitcoin require more trust, which weakens Bitcoins value proposition.
* Bitcoin is only useful if it is decentralized because centralization requires trust. Bitcoins value proposition is trustlessness.
The larger the hash-rate a single miner controls, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes and the more trust using Bitcoin requires.
* Running your own full node while mining rather than giving another entity the right to your hash-power decreases the hash-rate of large miners. Those who have hash-power are able to control their own hash power if and only if they run a full node.
* Less individuals who control hash-power will run full nodes if running one becomes more expensive[4].

You keep $100 worth of BTC with no password (these are visible after you login), and you keep the rest behind password.

I use trezor. I don't know I can trust the hardware. I trust others have examinded/audited the code.
As for the cold storage, I like to have the option to move my funds if I want, whenever I want. If it's friday evening I'd have to wait 'til monday to get to the bank (which in itself is a hassle).
The backup seed for my trezor is in my safe deposit box, and my bitcoins are behind trezorlogin + passwords so I simply prefer that setup.
But yes you have a valid point in trusting the hardware, I'm not sure how to adress that properly.

Clearly $100 was an arbitrary amount in an example to prove a point.

If you are trusting anyone with YOUR coins then the problem is you.

You are asking questions NO ONE can answer.
If a 10-15% drop is making you extremely anxious you are investing in the wrong thing.
