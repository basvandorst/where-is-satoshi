WTF? I don't know whether I should upvote or downvote this! Obviously, life is precious no matter what.
@_date: 2014-05-31 09:20:53
No, it's not. I'm an early adopter. But that's a funny question, thank you. :)
$710 because it was a major resistance point on 3rd of March this year.
Safe trading!
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:21:35
Interesting, thank you.
Good luck!
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:11:47
Next stop, $710!

It is true that most men open their hearts only when they are drunk, because of their inability or fear to show emotions due to social programming.
However, I believe it takes a mature man to post this, a man comfortable enough to share his feelings.
To answer your question: no, he's not drunk, he's a real man.

How is this different than bitbet.us ?

Ok. I'll stop. Let me just withdraw my coins and the rest of the cash ... Gimme a second!
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:57:20
Good one though! :)

you can erase this, it is already posted couple of times, plus it is on the main page as well. no need to clutter Thanks!

Easy solution: move your BTC to exchange one hour before the action starts.
This is the same as taking a medicine for pain, one hour before it hurts.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:38:32
Seems like I'm not the only one who figured this out. Well, at least now I've subscribed to both your blogs.

I was surprised not to see blockchain.info on block explorers list. I'm in no affiliation with them, other than using it for the past years..

I see, thank you!

We still seem to make this mistake. They DO NOT ACCEPT bitcoins per se, they accept BitPay. That is, only use Bitcoin as a means for lower commissions.
Think how many businesses have accepted BitPay since 2013, and that has had little impact on the price of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:49:51
Have you deposited USD in order to buy BTC? Because if you haven't deposited ANY USD, just some BTC to trade, and now you're requesting BTC back, they should NOT do this.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:55:11
Good luck!

The fee for the $155 million transfered yesterday wasn't for 37 cents, it was.... 0(zero).

I deleted the post... since I missed it and is no longer live.
Have you seen this  June 2013 Conference?
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:19:42
"If any of the outputs (including any change) of your transaction are less than 0.01 BTC, then a fee of 0.0001 BTC is required. The coin selection algorithm is careful to avoid selecting coins that result in a change amount of less than 0.01 BTC if at all possible." (from bitcoinfees dot com)
So I think if you send over 0.01 BTC it has a higher priority, regardless of the fee.
Anyway check out that above site, useful info.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:32:45
A transaction can have a maximum of 2 outputs (one for change).
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:57:44
I agree with you and the OP, even though in the thread of your proposal I proposed either switching to staoshis or splitting the bitcoin... without much thinking, I admit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:06:23
Strictly on market price and volume history on Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:42:34
Was just about the send them an email about this fee too. Then I saw this thread. 0.0001 is the new standard.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:50:11
And that's like the ultimate charitable thing he could do.
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:34:50
Yes, it is called sweeping, as you "sweep" the whole amount into a wallet that has access to a lot of fresh addresses and can properly spend those swept funds.
By "properly spend" I mean a wallet that has access to a lot more fresh bitcoin addresses that it can use as change addresses.
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:33:37
The fact that you have so many posts on reddit, and presumably a lot of posts on r/Bitcoin as well, which means you are technically an informed person, AND at the same time you say there is very little information about the fundamentals of bitcoin... sais a lot to me and I won't enter a debate with you, because I strongly believe you have difficulties in being objective.
Therefore I won't give you arguments.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:02:59
Has it started yet? Is this the link? 
EDIT: Got it. Straight on the main page: 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:13:31
Yes. Making a payment has the option of choosing a custom fee (as opposed to the standard fee, which is 0.0005 instead of 0.0001).
The problem lies when importing a private key (sweeping), it is imported with the 0.0005 fee.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:39:20
I like this. That's quite an inspired name. You are not that dumb, after all. Upvoted!

You can only borrow money for the purposes of trading bitcoins or litecoins inside bitfinex. And to borrow, you also need colateral money on bitfinex.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:18:33
:) That may be true. However, this won't simply go away like that. A lot of people will write about that. There will be a lot of tension. In the end, we shall see... 
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:54:35
That is the option 2 it talked about, with 1.00000000 becoming 1,000.00000. There may be difficulties with past transactions embedded in the blockchain though...
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:56:56
Yes, I learned something new today. I downvoted myself and upvoted your response, since I was in the wrong. This is so that readers get the right information, it is important for the faster adoption of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:29:59
Yes, I would as confident as you are. But that is not the point.
It is just as giving a friend a new car as a gift, and you keeping a pair of the keys.

That is real nice. You have a great dad!

I may indeed have acted childish. If I offended you by referring to you, I apologize.
It's just that over the years I have come to the conclusion that the more vehemently one person "argues" for his point of view, the less likely he is to listen to the other person, objectively, and change his mind if that is the case.

From what I understood from spending last few hours trying to grasp it, it is about paying taxes. It is about associating an amount of coins with your identity. It is about the Government knowing how much you spent, where you spent, in order to asses the amount you have and collect taxes from you.
The moment they have your address and see that a certain amount of coins reaches you... You have to pay a percentage of that to the Government. It is about theft.

I am waiting for a face to face debate between Schiff and Erik Voorhees. I won't waste my time on other "debates". No disrespect to Stefan Molyneux, but there are very few people more knowledgeable and articulate than Erik on the subject of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:06:00
He announced it on twitter. Looks like we missed it... he spoke 30 minutes ago:

I based my statement from Satoshi's paper: "Normally there will be either a single input 
from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two 
outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender. "
Apparently this was changed at some point. 
From examining the blockchain, it seems having more than 2 outputs is a rare exception, with more than 90%+ of transactions having at most 2 outputs.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:53:23
2 months??!! Over $1000 in less than 48h.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:56:33
Short answer: Yes, and fairly easy. They can reconstruct the public key from your private key.
See this bitcointalk link for further technical details:

I really hope Satoshi Nakamoto will remain a mystery forever.
All wanting to unveil him have little respect for Satoshi.

Because a 747 is just not enough.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:53:16
I agree this is controversial and may not be a great idea.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:23:11
That is kind of you.
Just make sure you tell them to sweep the bitcoin from the paper wallets as soon as possible, as it means they would have to trust you with not spending those bitcoin.

If it crashes today...
It may bounce at (MtGox prices, $465 the price at the time of this writing):
* $395 (15% drop) - weak support given by previous resistance;
* $295 (38% drop) - strong support, as it was the previous higher low;
* $266 (43% drop) - stronger support, as it was a previous ATH
* $200 (57% drop) - very strong, previous major consolidation, round number.
* $135 (71% drop) - strong support, breakout value
* $50 (90% drop) - huge support (lowest point since April crash)
* &lt;$50 - major blow to bitcoin, entering depression... don't wanna be here.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:11:00
Yeah... They seemed to attack it as much as they could. But hats off to Roger for fast, concise and to the point answers!
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:15:36
I agree with this. This is precisely my point too. We should use go straight to satoshis. See

It is based on technical analysis methods.

A lot of people still don't quite grasp the idea that a MilliBit is still difficult to wrap you head around if you are non technical. And a lot of people are non techincal.
Just imagine a dialogue: "So one Bitcoin is 1000 Mili... and what if what I want to buy costs a quarter of a Milli... would that be 25 milicents? WTF? It's too complicated. Bitcoin isn't for me".
I agree with what is written here  , and I think a better idea from the psychological point of view would be to either switch directly to Satoshi (a problem would be that it's still too cheap at the moment, however it leaves room for the increasing capitalization) or we could "split" the Bitcoin similar to shares in a company, where 1 BTC would become 1000BTC (21M -&gt; 21B) from an effective date (this would be a technical solution.. not sure how easy it would be to implement).
EDIT: As [Max_Findus]( said below, splitting the Bitcoin may be a bad idea for various reasons (implementation, confusion).
Two more points in favor of switching to Satoshis:
1. It will solve the confusion derived from having the same name for the payment system/protocol (Bitcoin) and currency (Bitcoin). The protocol would keep its name (Bitcoin) and the currency will be named Satoshi.
2. It would mean further gratitude in the honor of Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:50:29
Same here. I do however expect that they will fix this, so I'm not that worried to be honest.
But I will think twice of using Bitstamp if this happens again in the future.
