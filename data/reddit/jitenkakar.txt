Now looking for a bank which will allow this... 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:17:31
Yup any idea when it’s going to be live?
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:06:35
My banks restricts money transfer to international or foreign exchange ://
Any other way?
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:47:43
Zeba pay is notorious to keep selling price way below... 
anyway your comment didn’t help to what I originally asked 
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:46:20
They have a demo running... 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:39:45
Yeah true..
I’m at much better position now... really starting to know crypto and related systems in and out 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:26:06
Haha 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:44:51
Bro I transferred, within hours bank called me they have cancelled because of regulations.. can’t transfer to trading portals..
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:22:19
Now that’s something.. I already have paypal..
How does the transaction works? 
Does it involve a lot of trust?
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:45:53
Value of bitcoin average around world right now is INR 7,30,000
Value of bitcoin in Zeba pay right now is INR 8,00,000 
That’s a freaking $1100 difference or 1 ETH.. 
These portals imposing TAX before any wealth gain.. also there market volume is 27 bitcoins.....
If you have any solution by which I can buy from international exchange.. please enlighten me..
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:06:04
My bank has a policy for no international transfers to trading portals or to buy bitcoin. 
Anyway that I can buy pass this??
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:38:09
Bank wouldn’t want decentralised system 
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:44:06
Coinbase doesn’t allow support in our country... just checked 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:23:15
Yeah it helped..thanks.. anyway did you notice that prices fall down at night and rises in afternoon in India.. you can share some insights about things completely idiosyncratic to India, given you have some experience 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:27:25
Guidelines by RBI.... so guess will apply to all Indian banks 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:43:09
Yeah! No day trading possible...
I’m just gonna buy and hold BTC and ETH ...
So in this way we don’t need international exchange... hell I’m waiting for the time when we remove exchanges also and decentralised systems develop in this too 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:32:59
Just had a glance, it’s same as Bisq.. 
the problem is not many people using it.. at any time there like  5-10 people active and only 2-3 offers... 
most of the offers to buy bitcoins are through Zelle, which again is not available in India 
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:24:06
Kidnapping happened last month :/!! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:40:58
Exactly! Now I see how much the government is controlling all the funds and everything is monitored...
The minute you deviate, all red signals turn up in these institutions 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:46:29
Not really a bad plan! ��
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:37:50
Yeah bro :/ so unfortunate 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:26:53
Yeah like I said in one other comment, at any given team only 5-10 people are online.. with most of them having only Zelle payment gateway 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:29:19
There was kidnapping last month through local bitcoin... :/ :/
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:19:38
To do transition from fiat  to crypto is so difficult :/ 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:19:08
Nice! You have got a really Ironical username though.. ��
