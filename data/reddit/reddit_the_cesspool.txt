Coincidentally I learned about hepatoscopy just the other day. They even had marked-up models of livers to help them “read” the organ upon removal, and only trained people were allowed to perform it.

What are large amounts to you?

This is hardly a crash.

Have you tried day-trading before? I’m not saying people don’t do it with success, but it is a great way to lose your money as well. 
Using trading to turn your $10/month into something more substantial may prove more difficult than you realize.

I wanted to ask them that too, but I’d felt I’d already replied to them enough. I don’t think they can have been following btc for over year...I don’t think one could have been here for November 2018 and still consider yesterday/today a crash.

Sorry they were so rude to you. I don’t think there’s any reason other than it’s risky, for very little pay off if it actually works out. There’s a very high chance the trade won’t go how you would like it to, for what? The gist is that many people overestimate they’re ability to make an actually good trade. Have you actually tried trading? Many people have a poor opinion of it because their trade attempts result in unnecessary losses. 
If you think you can outsmart the market, which *some* occasionally do, go for it. Just don’t be surprised when your losses become realized, and it becomes obvious that making a good trade isn’t easy.

Attempting to day-trade isn’t going remediate the fact that you (and I) didn’t get in early. But I don’t think that was the point of the people who replied to you. If you were asking about day trading, they probably just wanted to make clear how risky it is, and that trying to make day-trading your primary means of increasing your stacks is, for many people, just asking for losses.

Just the tip?
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:43:52
Sorry, I don’t mean to say that there are never ever times where making a trade could be wise. I move my holdings between BTC and a couple of other alts from time to time. Mainly, I just want it to be clear how easy it is for day-trading to result in a loss, and that you should be cautious of it. 
It honestly never went well every time I traded between btc and usd, or whatever stablecoin, and by the end of it I felt I would have just been better off not having made the trade at all. And if the trade did go well, what did I gain? Pennies, a few dollars? At what risk? 
Unfortunately, the success of day-trades are for most people the result of luck, in my experience. It’s very common for people new to the space to want to give everything a try, including trading, only to be hit with a rude awakening when most of their trades don’t work out. They get frustrated, and conclude that in such an already volatile space, it’s wisest to play it safe and hodl most of the time. That’s why you get so many people chanting “HODL! Just hodl!”
I can’t speak for the mining of alts, I’ve never attempted to mine. But I dont think having holdings in a few other alts is a bad idea. However, I can’t ignore the fact that since my first purchase in Jan 2018, just about every dollar I put into an alt would have been better spent in BTC.
Edit: sorry for fat wall of text

That could make it a shit coin.

Thank you mister gape ��

If you do have the seed in paper place it in the center of a thick book fire won’t burn it.

It’s sad to see it go, but it makes me look forward to all the new price memes to come.
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:03:02
There are those who would say it’s a shitcoin, but I think all of those would be btc maximalists, and I doubt even they would say ltc is in the same league as those that are more obviously shitcoins. Personally, I think calling it a shitcoin would be at least a little disingenuous. The market is filled with many coins that are massively more deserving of that title. Not that there being others more deserving proves that ltc isn’t one, but it can certainly call into question what constitutes a shitcoin and what doesn’t.

Use a search engine to find the top crypto exchanges available in your country. They get discussed on this sub and others quite a bit, so it shouldn’t take long to find out. Very importantly though, make sure to thoroughly research an exchange before you do anything with them. Check forums like this one to see how their reputation/credibility is. This sub, as well as r/cryptocurrency, as well as others are good resources if you’re unfamiliar with the space.

r/cryptocurrency &lt;—
Edit: don’t @ me if nobody over there ends up being helpful though haha

For the first time in a long time I’m 100% in BTC. Special thanks to BNB this past year, but in the end it was always for one thing.
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:53:01
No problem! The HODL meme could have come from a specific person, I don’t know. But I figure it was just Internet forums being forums.

Seeing as you’re gaining interest with some decent time between now and the past ATH, it’s not the worst time to get into it. Regardless though, no one knows what will happen next and there could still be *a lot* of time until the next ATH, and there could even be more downtrend action for who knows how long...it’s all a mystery. If you’re comfortable buying and holding onto it for awhile, go for it. Just don’t expect any sort of get-rich-quick magic (and so be mindful with how much you’re willing to throw down). That happens to a very lucky few. For most people involved, it’s a pure waiting game.

Noob-ish question incoming; I should’ve clarified this for myself a long time ago—
Say today I realized that my electrum wallet is in fact just standard and not segwit. There’s no way to make my standard wallet segwit, and I need to create and transfer to a new, segwit wallet, correct? 
And also, how significantly would the fee prices improve?
