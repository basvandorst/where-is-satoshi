well, that was classy of you, i didnt expect this thread to wake up like that on sunday...I noticed your help btw...have a glass of wine on me @_date: 2014-10-11 09:27:39
If you have any substantial hodlings then you neeeed to do it. no one is gonna bitch for you keeping a few hundred or grand in an easier web/app wallet. Only ur pocket change/what you can loose.
the rest gets the deep freeze....cuz if you dont then there wont be any sympathy when you get screwed...not that the sympathy will help anyways.

Bitcoin isnt booming. When Bitcoin is booming, you wont have to ask these questions
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:41:38
ahh, it wouldnt have felt right unless you responded like a cock sucker.
here is one for ya. compared to current credit card chargebacks, this potential problem your so worried about (wich is currently under scrutiny and receiving consideration) is still trivial. in the overall grand scheme of things, to have one jackass steal a tv every now and then wont be any worse than having a 7-11 robbed at gunpoint...your suggesting that bitcoin is so broken that its unusable, and that you prefer to pay the current system to continue to suck the life out of you.
bitch moan and complain - or go help find a solution. or go short some bitcoin. or fuck off.

@_date: 2014-10-11 09:52:12
I dont think thats actually a problem. Its a very minor trade off for the value that bitcoin brings to the table. My concern is why the fuck anyone needs 6 confirmations - especially for a $12 digital product....
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:17:32
if you consider there are 7 billion people, then thats about 
 


Then consider that in 100 years there are








So if everyone in the world who is alive right now will live for 100 years, then we would all cumulatively experience


and that means for every second of 7 billion peoples perfect 100 year life, there are enough bitcoin addresses so that everyone could have 


**Thats about 9 and a half Quintillion addresses for everyone each second.**

Far less baffled. Have a beer! @_date: 2014-10-11 10:05:42
I agree whole heartedly, and while there are currently solutions to this probem, I hate them. I also hate QR codes (actually I love them, i just hate how crappy the adoption is in general for QR)
We already have a system in place where everyone can only have one address and people are used to exchanging it.
I was thinking about a service that gives every email address a bitcoin address, then you can tell people to send money to your email through the service. you could log in through verifying the email to collect/move/send BTC and everytime someone sends you BTC it would give you a new address so your wallet collects it all but each sender cant look and see how much you have received.
it sounds like something that should exist already - it might...its only half baked and I already can think of problems with it (mostly security and double @ signs lol....its getting late)
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:40:35


Opinions are like a-holes


Here is a stretch, sure, but assuming both consumer and merchant have bitcoin and dollars, dollar would have a few more problems, like possible counterfeit bills, dealing with change, less divisibility, dealing with large bills, and if its credit (or debit) then the merchant enjoys fees and charge backs...so your right, the dollar is more spendable - today...i will admit that a bitcoin transaction cannot occur without being connected...dollars can(if they are real)


Your right, there is a difference between anonymous and pseudonymous, thats true. Transferring funds between wallets can occur anonymously however. It is the act of turning those funds into fiat/merchandise that creates a link to the identity...stop screaming.


Sure If you leave your private key just lying around it is bound to get stolen like anything else, the point is that if proper precautions are taken that bitcoin is actually beyond theft resistant and actually theft proof. Best dollars can say to that is FDIC insured.


Your a nice guy. Thorough too....thanks for the constructive criticism.

sure - I can agree wih you there, so let me explain instead.
Scarcity in the sense that you typically hear when the topic is bitcoin generally means that there is no unlimited supply. No Ben Bernake can push a button and print 10 trillion more bitcoin.
Just like gold, there is only so much available. The problem with your use is that your equating lesser amounts with scarcity. Spreading bitcoin around and giving some to more people may make the amount of bitcoin in the average wallet seem more "scarce by the websters definition of the term, but it wont make bitcoin any more scarce - in fact widespread adoption makes the same amount of bitcoins more valuable, as we are experiencing with the price rising as we speak.
For example, if it was 2010 and there were only 100 people using bitcoin and it was worth $0.20 each, then you have 1 hundred people with thousands of coins....3 or 4 years go by and now thousands and thousands of people have coins, and the average bitcoin owners stake might be (im guessing) 1-20 coins...and the value of a coin has grown exponentially....sorry for being so condescending before and for my currently poor explanation here as it stands.
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:09:18
your right. Lets go wire funds and wait for 7 days. or no no....lets use checks and they will clear by tomorrow (or monday...)
its on the list of things to do, its not a deal breaker.

when was the last time you used something othr than a smartphone or an internet connected computer to exchange value with someone in bitcoin?
can i t be done? sure, borrow a library computer, commit a brainwallet to memory....but now ur not joe

@_date: 2014-07-03 09:55:14
you missed the point. OPEC couldnt agree to an alternative currency before...bitcoin is one option that doesnt choose sides or come with favoritism - it would be the obvious choice to anyone who viewed the petrodollar as shackles. All the dollar has to do to win is drop a bomb and be the reserve currency...there isnt a better regulated option - but regulated was the only option until bitcoin.
its not a matter of "will it" but a matter of "when"

no no no....thats not ok, you cant just charge people to have an email conversation with them. 
Someone should give him some brutally honest advice - lucky him, I wont charge for the service this time (tips are appreciated)
I know that dollars are becoming worthless and all, but for $10 you should expect something more than a 1000px tall template site.
There simply neeeeds to be some more value. Consider video responses, heavily redacted and anonomized publishing of the Q/A sessions, referencing prior reviews from other sites to show us the caliber of review we can expect, offer skype sessions (or google hangout/whatever), pricing packages for different levels or offerings....more than 100 words on a website....a better bio...
if he doesnt have any previos clients yet to publish some of his work then he should offer freebies to people so he can create a portfolio so to say.
also, spellcheck - there are not 3 sss's in professional (and paypal is technically with 2 capitol "P"s)
probably more effective to just go panhandling, I doubt anyone will give you money for this. They shouldnt anyways

kinda...unless you think you can buy the car, leave the guy who sold it to you after signing the required documents, not let the guy know who you are so the police couldnt knock on your door and all in under ~10 minutes then I wouldnt worry about it.
imagine buying a house. You and the previous owner agree that $300k in BTC is a fair price. A handshake occurs, a qr code is displayed and then small talk for 10 to 60 minutes while you wait...
also, if I dont necessarily agree with a boycott unless you dont wait for confirmations either...
