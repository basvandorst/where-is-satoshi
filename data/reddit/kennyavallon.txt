Well said. I never would have convinced my parents to put money into bitcoin unless I truly believed in its potential. The sad thing is that most people don’t want to do the research. If they see the price jumping, they all the sudden become interested and look a little deeper into what it is. Seems like after some deeper research people will have that “ah ha” moment and understand that bitcoin is the best version of money ever created,

Lmao some people are bitter. I just think it’s a funny convo that shows how a lot of people still don’t pay attention. I probably could have said any number and she wouldn’t have known.

Done. You should add a comment section at the end of the survey so that people can elaborate a bit more. I want to run a full bitcoin node and to open up my own lightning node. I just need to do a bit more research

Interesting I always say eleven hundred or twelve hundred in that format. Maybe it’s a regional thing because most people I know do the same

This is awesome! I might sound ridiculous/misunderstand the process, but does the cold salt water being pumped into the system have any effect on keeping the computers cool? It would be pretty neat if there were a way to cool your mining equipment while simultaneously heating the water. Could be a bit dangerous in the event of an accident though.
