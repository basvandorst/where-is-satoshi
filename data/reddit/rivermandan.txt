wait a second. who in the fucking planet, other than my half retarded friend who sold blackberrys at the time, laughed at the iphone? I remember the world collectively scraping its chin off the floor the moment it was announced

I don't know anything about this stuff and have never had CC, so for what that is worth, my opinion is 50K APRIL 
if I am right, I demand no cash or kudos, only a PM by someone saying "you were right", since those three words are enough to get me off

I'll poke around the shop and see if I can't track one of those discs down

s are good quality maxell though, so they're fine. it's the detritus you buy in a spindle that doesn't last as long as you'd like.
that said, I still have windows 95 dics burned on the lowest quality cdrs that are scratched beyond belief and probably still working. I still occasionally back up 5 1/4 floppies for customer that still read with no problems miraculously.

it's the top of the disc, not the bottom. I grabbed another from that same spindle and wiped my finger over the top of it, like, no finger nail use, and it peeled right off. 
quality discs have that foil like layer sandwiched between two layers of plastic, but the cheap ones just laminate the top with the important bit it seems

I tried shoving an old disc in a drive a while back, it spun and made a very wrong noise, and when I ejected it it was entirely translucent because the substrate was stripped of fjust from the air current
