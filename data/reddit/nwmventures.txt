Simply a bitcoin address within the program Armory which i chose to "receive" months ago. Sadly on my laptop which I currently use the address they were sent to doesn't match the "receive" address. This leads me to believe I sent them to an Armory "Receive address" on my old desktop which I wont have access too for a couple months when I return home.

Sorry for double response. Is it possible to identify wallet source from blockchain ID. i.e. whether it was from coinbase, btc, breadwallet, etc... I feel like i've tried all combinations of my 3 emails with these sites but wanted to double check.

Thank you for your response. I believe I sent them to an Armory wallet before it came on line. According to the balance from Antmain it is close to 700$ which is unfortunate considering my current circumstances but not the end of the world. I was having a manic episode resulting in my arrest at the peak of the incident so I'm not surprised I don't remember where I sent them. Too bad but thanks again for your response.

Sadly no, I was pretty amateur at bitcoin but convinced it was going to be valuable at the beginning of this year. I searched all my e-mail accounts for the term but didn't have any luck. This led me to believe I foolishly sent it to an armory address which explicitly said don't send it to this address before it has been online. Oh well, Live and learn. Thank you for your time and advice.
