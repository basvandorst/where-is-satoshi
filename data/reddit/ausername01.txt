What are your alts of choice?
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:47:15
Please let me know too for iOS. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:10:18
I have the transaction ID etc. but that shows the total fee for multiple transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:21:58
This means transfer fees will increase, right?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:37:52
What are you expecting the price to be?
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:51:14
Thanks; the website looks useful.
How do I know - before transferring - the number if inputs and outputs?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:41:10
Great news; thank you for the quick reply.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:21:31
Cool, how can one access them and are there any costs?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:47:43
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:50:45
Where can one see a full list of past and planned forks?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:05:03
Can you share more details about the movie server please?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:30:36
Cool, cool. So I guess no discounts for me yet since the exchange nor wallet support segwit yet. Thanks again muchly for all your help!
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:39:36
When exchanges charge for withdrawal, does that include the mining fee or is it exchange + mining fees?

Hi again. Does the same logic apply from wallet to wallet? Let's say I received 5 incoming transactions but now want to send all at once as 1 transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:10:22
Umm, I get the logic. But what's input/output all about then like on the below site?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:00:11
Thank for explaining; so far is makes no sense to me and I'll attempt to read it again a few times, lol.
How do I know how big my transactions will be in order to calculate costs? FYI, I'll be transferring into a Ledger from an exchange (that already charge separately withdrawal!) and a desktop wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:58:39
Do you get taxed for 'gifts'? If not, send to someone in a country with lower/no taxes who then gives it as a gift to you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:45:08
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:34:12
Can you elaborate on this please? Escrow service etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:52:51
Thanks, but doesn't show any fees. Using Ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:13:52
Thanks again. I've read elsewhere about combining transactions into one. But since they're in different places, I have no choice but to consider them separate and put into the Ledger as one, right?
OR should I move from the Exchange to Exodus and then send all BTC to Ledger?
Exodus nor the exchange doesn't allow selecting fees etc., thus 
my original question of figuring out the best time to transfer.
Also, the segwit address starting with 3 is the receiving address; right? Can legacy send to segwit or is it only segwit to segwit? 
Thanks so much for your inputs (pun intended!).
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:50:53
Fee is 0.0021483 BTC in 369 bytes. Assuming I'm reading it right.
Sending OMG and ETH was like USD 0.21 and 0.39 or so in comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:23:04
Yeah, bitfinex always charge that.
So should I bother trying to figure out the best time to transfer to a wallet or just do it and hope it doesn't have a crazy cost attached? Last time it was USD 15 for a small amount.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:57:00
Awesome. Which now also raises a new questions I hadn't thought of. Do exchanges charge to receive crypto? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:28:03
What about from Amazon.com where the seller is Trezor?
Saves on shipping!
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:19:11
Not sure what to see in the link you set. But see the withdrawal fee section here: 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:25:49
I was going in that direction but now realize that ledger supports more altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:56:19
What happens if you don’t provide what they want? Won’t they send the BTC back to wherever you sent from? Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:22:54
Point 3 isn't a question. ;
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:04:35
What happens during a difficulty adjustment? Do prices go up or down or does something else happen?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:05:58
Thanks. It was from an exchange so maybe that's why.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:42:33
When you say 1-2 transactions do you mean 1 BTC or is the amount irrelevant?
I transferred 1-2 hours ago and it cost me about USD 15. :(
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:04:36
Yeah, makes sense.
Now my big question is the usual one: Ledger or Trezor. Sigh
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:02:27
Oh, I see that now. Thanks muchly; will have a look.
Any other tried and tested options you suggest?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:24:54
What's the verdict? Is Bitfinex safe to use/keep coins on or not?
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:38:48
Bitfinex charge 0.0005 btc to send money to a wallet. Plus mining fee. 
Is there any way to know the current miners fee before making the transaction? A site to check current costs or something?
Edit: 0.0005
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:04:44
Trezor link to it on their website.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:35:04
What's a distress wallet? Is it a feature on the Ledger?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:47:45
Just noticed; that’s weird. But the name on top says Trezor. And on Trezor’s website it links to that Amazon page. Hmm.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:13:57
Interesting post, thanks.
Any idea whether if all exchange to wallet transfers free?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:51:36
Atleast you had a choice I guess. Mine just processed without mentioning the fees or asking if I'm okay with them.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:30:26
When you say trade eth tokens, do you mean buy other coins with eth, or just buy/sell eth?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:06:52
Airbitz is only for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:03:40
0.0005 is Bitfinex’s fixed fee to withdraw. Mining fees etc. are different. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:33:59
Thanks. Which do you use/recommend for altcoins?

iOS says coming soon. Am waiting for it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:54:38
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:25:35
Thanks; I should edit my question. Have Window and iOS!
Edit: I have Blockfolio on iOS but it doesn't have an option for API's. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:05:54
No wonder; it was from an exchange. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:23:55
Yes, I see that now. My bad; sorry for panicking. Didn't know that kind of thing happens. It says still pending. When will I know the exact fee for my transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:03:57
