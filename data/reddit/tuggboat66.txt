The website and the currency are both run by the same conman.  The purpose of the website is to trick the uninformed into believing that bcash is bitcoin, while claiming that bitcoin is "core" or "legacy".  Roger Ver is a convicted felon who will do anything to turn a profit, and is likely only pumping bcash so that he can dump his collection (crashing the "currency").

A couple problems here;
First: Your use of metric prefixes is backwards, "milli-" means 1/1000, the prefix you're looking for is "Mega-" which means 10^6 (One Million).
~~Second: Your math.  If one "Bitcoin" is worth $1.5 then $3000 would buy 4500 "bitcoins". (You seem to have divided when you should have multiplied.)~~ Nope, tugg is just a dumbass tonight, probably needs some sleep.  My most sincere apologies.
Third: The unit you're suggesting is colloquially known as the "bit" (which has it's own problems, namely that "bit" means 1/8, but that's beside the point).   If we're going to use a subunit of the bitcoin as our main point of reference we should really stick to one that is already in use, let's look at those.
*Satoshis: There are one hundred million satoshis to a bitcoin, and the satoshi is the smallest unit currently available.  Current value is about 60sat/$0.01
* Bits:  There are one million bits to a bitcoin, making this a microbitcoin.  Current value is about 1bit/$0.02
* Finneys: There are ten thousand finneys to a bitcoin, or ten thousand satoshis per finney.  Current value is about 1finney/$1.66
* Millibits: There are one thousand Millibits to a bitcoin, the millibit never got a nickname so much as had it's name cut off due to laziness.  Current value is 1mbtc/$16.56
* Bitcents: One hundred bitcents per bitcoin.  Current value is 1bitcent/$165.62
   *current values taken from google 20:21PST 13/12/2017, all dollar values in USD

For every coin that is lost or destroyed, the value of every other coin goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:36:06
Whoa, easy there, I'm not looking for an equitable redistrobution of wealth.  I'm offering you a service in exchange for payment, that's like capitalism 101.
What kind of a dumbass doesn't know the difference betweer capitalism and communism?
(that one's free)
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:30:31
1.  As more people start using Bitcoin, more places start accepting Bitcoin as payment.  Hodlers now no longer need to sully themselves with obsolete currencies such as USD, and as such Bitcoins now change hands much more freely.  (This requires a solution to the TX fee issue)
2.  Entirely possible.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:05:14
CEX works too.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:24:02
Do you have any government issued ID at all?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:25:56
Option one is the best option.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:31:54
It is currently valued at $0/coin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:40:14
*By* 2018?  Probably not.
**By the end of** 2018?  Entirely possible.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:59:25
So... What are you looking to do?  Do you want to buy some bitcoin?  Do you want to know where you can get ridiculously small amounts of free bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:27
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:11:18
This "other bitcoin"... do you mean bitcoin gold?
I could see BTG gaining a foothold in less prosperous regions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:26:06
Bitcoin is money.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:36:04
But with the return of bitcoin's long lost creator, people's faith in the currency would be bolstered.
Plus, it's not like Satoshi's just going to come in and dump all his coins.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:21:24
Coins don't move until the transaction is verified.  The forked coins should be in the first wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:00:10
0.00000546 BTC received.  I hope this relieves any stress that you may have been experiencing.  Please consider using tugg for all your future currency disposal needs.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:36
I use cex.io, but they're not currently accepting new users.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:28:00
He had an insatiable desire to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:34:02
If you can get past bitcoin.com's bullshit without realizing the problem, there's nothing that anyone can tell you that will get through to you.
So either you're here to troll or you lack the basic capacity to spot a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:19:54
Well, you *can* buy $10 worth of bitcoin, but it's going to cost you $15.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:33
Yeah, it's fun to watch everyone scramble to dump their bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:55:21
Hodl her.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:42:15
That sounds like a problem for bcash.  I mean if b-cash is accepted as the real Bitcoin Cash, then bcash needs to rebrand themselves to something else... Maybe Bcash Legacy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:28:15
Call your bank.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:35:11
What's there to be concerned about?  One more company that is storing our personal information?  Your bank or your government are just as susceptible to breaches.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:51:43
Most people around here can only count to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:19:06
Just a reminder, don't do crime.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:01:11
Technically no, but you really should.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:23
It's in the wallet that your btc was in on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:52:31
So you talked to someone who had no idea what they were talking about, and they fed you a load of shit.  There's no way to undo a transaction, and the [license]( for Electrum's wallet software says that they're not liable for damages.
I get it, you're pissed off about your lost money, but it's gone and it won't be coming back.  Accept this extremely expensive lesson and move on with your life.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:45:46
Are you... using your computer to cook a steak?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:32:16
And we think you're technologically illiterate if you think that Electrum can reverse a blockchain transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:00:39
Probably going to try to pump bcash.

Quark deserves a spin-off.

They'll never change their name.  The only value that their coin has is because of the Bitcoin brand.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:27:14
That'd be nice.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:26:17
Satoshi created Bitcoin so that he could HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:31:24
It should come through in the next day or two.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:36:35
In this context "we" is anyone who has even the most basic understanding of how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:44:31
The coinbase account?  Without taking the bitcoin out?  That shouldn't have been possible.  It's probably still there.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:27:18
Move somewhere where there are no taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:32
Nope.  However scummy it is, there is no law against domain squatting.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:42:14
1. HODL!
2. We can't remember that long ago!  Our memories get reset everytime we fall asleep.
3. Two Weeks^tm
4. It's just not congested enough yet; once people actually start using it, it'll slow right down.
Does the future have any more questions? 
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:14:29
Yes, just not in relation to bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-10 23:51:06
This would depend on whether or not you are exchanging them for fiat currency.  
If so, yes: You would then be obligated to report your earnings to the government.  On the other hand, if you are just sitting on a pile of bitcoins, you have nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:36:35
The PS4 gets more attractive with every announcement.
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:21:31
Much like any currency, the value of the bitcoin is dependant on it's perceived value to the person you are bartering with.  
As bitcoins become more difficult to produce (with rising energy costs, decreasing block size, etc.), and they become more widely used their perceived (and exchange) value will rise.
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:35:23
If they ever ship these, they will be extremely attractive.
@_date: 2013-06-11 22:31:35
Then they would just be a nifty item that someone would inevitably find a use for.  The nature of this usage is unknown to me, but there are many people with more creativity than me.
@_date: 2013-06-10 23:38:13
This looks pretty good, but I feel that it would be much better if the first "i" wasn't so long.
