Cardano is only a white paper. Having the greatest team ever is such a risk as there is nothing keeping them from moving to another project that pays better. Also by the time they release the mainnet it's competitors will have so many Dapps already in place. It's like if a company started a new operating system to compete with Apple and Android, no one will use it if it's lacking a library of Dapps (which is built up over years of having a real product) no Whatsapp no Instagram no usage no matter how good the final product is the end user doesn't care.

When I was 15, I would buy those prepaid visa gift cards and register them with a fake address and names. Sure the fees are ultra high, but looking back it's so worth, plus your protected against exchanges handing over your information.

So if people want to use the core bitcoin what chain do we use? Legacy or segwit?? Or are they both supported by the core developers?

loop-hole, if they ever make BTC illegal to own, simply encrypt ur private keys and bury it in some remote area, since the government owns that land technically they already seized your coins but don't know it. Its what gold bugs did in the 1940s.

except only boomers trade paper, millennials are all going to use BTC by default or at least a custodian service on a Dex
