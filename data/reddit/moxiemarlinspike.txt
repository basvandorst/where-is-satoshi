The first ever BitHub payout was for $19.12USD to Kyle.

We'll see how it goes.  Right now the commit payout is ~20.  If we can get it around ~100, that's not insignificant for a college kid who's time rich and cash poor.

Actually, the smaller stuff is really where we need help.  There are a few of us who are dedicated to the project and spend a lot of time working on the big changes, but in the mean time we're drowning in tons of little stuff.  I would love it if this results in a flurry of tiny pull requests that address all the minor things which pile up.

Not anyone has commit access.  You have to submit a pull request that someone with write access to the repository has to approve.

The project is OSS, so anyone can take it and use it for any type of project they'd like.  We happen to be a privacy-oriented project, so that's how this is framed.

We always have the ability to determine whether we merge a pull request or not.  If someone sends us something we consider useful, even on a very small level, a 2% payout is better than not receiving any commits. If someone sends us something that's obviously garbage, we just reject the pull request.

If you have other payout strategies you'd like to experiment with, we'd love to see you integrate them into the project (it pays out commits on itself!).
