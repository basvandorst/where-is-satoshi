Well, he probably won't win a majority of the primaries. That doesn't eliminate him as a contender for the Republican presidential bid, though it would be hard to find someone to be his VP. I don' think he'd get chosen as a VP for anybody.

@_date: 2011-05-25 23:16:31
As dedicated mines run ever more and more powerful rigs, fewer and fewer people will mine, but the hash rate will stay the same. At some point, a major miner will drop out, and the difficulty rate will drop a bit, and some people who aren't as highly powered will jump in for a bit, until the difficulty rate goes back up. Repeat until you either run out of bitcoins or the difficulty rate becomes so high that people just won't mine any more.

Idiot speculation, yes.
To pay for stuff that you could get using fiat currency but would rather avoid the hassle of using fiat currency, and so use bitcoins.
To tip random people around the world. For example, me: 1EX8cENLHH7xRd8ByyrwXx4xFNzYJb5LwB
For giggles and shits, giggles and shits. That's why I'm in. 
To pay for stuff that you can only get with bitcoin. You make it sound like this is a bad thing. What's wrong with supporting your local alt-currency by selling stuff using it? You can buy groceries, merit badges, anonymous web hosting, car repairs, bulk metal, vinyl records and [more](

Yes, I know that. If I'm not using my computer, my GPU gets about 5.5Mhash/s, and I'm looking to add to that number using a CPU miner that is configurable for Ubuntu 10.04 x64 that I can point to the BTCmine pool. I'm just looking for recommendations on a CPU miner.

If you can, cut the fronts off of the boxes and replace the front of the housings with high-flow fans: this will aid in keeping the boards cool. You will want air filtration on the boxes, so put something like the whole-house air filters in front of the intake fans. You want to make sure that the only air intake is through that filter. You'll also want to make sure that your hot air has a place to escape to, say out a window. You want to keep the rig dust-free and well-aired.

That would require a larger network failure than just the ties between Europe and the US. I'm not finding any articles describing the connections (for good reason) but there are major trans-Pacific lines that that would allow North Americans to connect to Europeans, if slowly.
If there was some tremendous outage, large enough that one continent was completely separated from all others, I think we'd have other worries than if our bitcoins were spent correctly, but I think that the network would arrive at a consensus based on which transaction had the more verifications. (I don't know at all.)
@_date: 2011-05-25 10:39:49
I'd like to use all I got, which is what you see above. Any recommendations?

I know it's not worth it if I'm paying for my electricity. I'm not paying for my electricity. The real reason I'm mining is so I can buy [this]( I'm in the BTCmine.com pool, with about 3 bitcents to my name in the pool, and two bitcents to my name in my wallet, from the faucet. I know that I'm not going to make any money off of this; I'm just doing it for shits and giggles. 
I'd like them to be efficient shits and worthwhile giggles, though, which is why I'm asking this question.

0.155, at ~5 MHash/s.
@_date: 2011-05-24 16:30:00
Yes. Which it will. At some point in the future, the miners might give up, and the difficulty rate will fall, but then I'd guess they'd jump back in. Then they're left with home supercomputers. What do you do with a supercomputer in your basement? Run AIs?
@_date: 2011-05-26 23:09:57
So, you take a random number, all transactions since the last block, and the hash of the last block, put them together, and hash them, and if the hash's 256-bit number is less than the current target, then you've made a block, which gets you a certain number of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2011-05-25 18:05:47
Thank you; I will definitely look into this.
@_date: 2011-06-23 00:31:01
If I understand the tech right, what you're saying is that by the nature of the transaction process, no one knows *which* bitcoins were spent, just that the coins were validly spent.

[Reading the wiki]( blocking Bitcoin traffic could easily be done at an ISP level by blocking ports 6667, 7777, and 8883. Circumvention measures for this would require changing the ports used. 
Blocking the peer-finding feature would require removing DNS entries for irc.lfnet.org, or  blocking access to irc.lfnet.org at the ISP level. There is already a built-in circumvention in the Bitcoin client, which has a built-in list of nodes to query in case the nodefinding feature is down. Poisoning those nodes is unfortuantely doable with DNS redirects, or even nastier IP address redirects. Circumventing lesser forms of blockage would require switching IRC servers or proxies.

Aircool it, then use an a/c to squeeze heat from the air and into a boiler. Use the boiler to provide steam for a steam turbine that powers a generator, powering the a/c. You'll lose some heat to work.

Alas, I only have the 0.02 from the Faucet, else I would buy one. It's the only real reason I started mining, because I wanted one of those meritbadges.

I guess I should've asked "How does the difficulty determine the block production rate? Where does it factor into the calculations, making a result that would've been valid with the old difficulty into a no-longer-valid result?"

I don't always mine, but when I do, I use BTCmine.com.

Not really. There's a hard upper limit set by the number of private keys: ~1.40904789 × 10^59. You could achieve a theoretical current upper limit by reading the block chain and seeing the number of addresses that currently possess Bitcoins, but some of those are held by more than one person, so the number is lower. You could try to match those addresses with individual users, by matching published identities to net or realworld identities, but the number of such connection you would be able to successfully make is small.

It's an alternative currency. It's kinda like cash, because it's anonymous and you can't keep track of who has how many bills, but you can send it over the Internet. There's not much that you would be willing to go to the hassle of using bitcoins to buy, and you have to sell stuff to get bitcoins anyway.
