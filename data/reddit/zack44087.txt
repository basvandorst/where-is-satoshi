as much as this sub likes to hodl, i think that if you have made gains to get something substantial like a fancy car or large payment on a house then i too would sell for those gains.

ITT people who never sell for any reason...
you need to sell bitcoin...it is a currency...if everyone held onto their bitcoin and never sold ever then there'd be no reason to have any. I say sell and go on the trip, sure the price may rise and in years you may look back on it and have some regret for selling, but what a story it'll be to tell your kids that magic internet money paid for  your proposal trip to japan.

I feel like this is a good place for me to chime in! back in September I bought an Antminer S2 for $250 which I knew would be unprofitable. I made this choice not because I thought that bitcoin would spike to what it is currently, but because I was considering getting an S9, which is the current top of the line, but costs 15x the price of an S2 on ebay. I figured that I could afford $250 to test out how mining worked and get comfortable with it before making such a large investment. I am happy to report that because of the price increase, my S2 which was basically written off due to its hashrate has now become profitable at the current prices! So overall I'm happy, and instead of running it at a loss until I was comfortable with it, I am now running it for a profit!

profit and loss
basically a balance of if you are making or losing money

I bought a Antminer S2 a few months ago because they were on ebay for $250 and I just wanted to play around with mining. It wasn't profitable when I bought it and I expected that, however with the recent upswing in BTC's price it is actually profitable a little bit. I get about .0011BTC per week and when I minus my electric cost of $0.069/KwH the current profits are about $3 per week. The main thing I would reccomend would be to look for how much the power costs for you as well as hot much power the machine uses and find a good fit. Hope this helped!

well in that case, take my upvote!

not OP, but i would guess that you dont want lines going over your house because in the event of bad weather knocking down live lines, you would have very high voltage lines falling onto your home, not typically the safest thing.

They tell you not to move if you get hit badly like that, worst thing you can do if you break your neck is try to stand up. Until the doc comes over and tells you to get up, its in your best interest to stay down. He was able to walked off the field however.
