Personally, I don't really understand futures.

When I first verified with gemini it took a while (this was a couple months ago). I can't remember the exact time, but I remember it taking at least a week.

Yeah, I've still got it. Thanks for this by the way

Makes sense so far.

Ethereum dropped 50 or so dollars on gdax only around the same time as well. It also pretty quickly recovered

Well, now I do

I'm still with you I think. Futures is riskier than normal trading, but has a higher reward, correct?

I had this thought when reading this, about more people buying into it suddenly (I have a wallet, just no bitcoins) and thought about doing the same, just because I've always wanted one bitcoin, but then I remembered I'm poor, and already missed the time when bitcoin was cheap.

just dabbling here and there.  The error wasnt even related to cryptocurrency, just "normal" bank errors.

Not on my end, I'm continually getting 504s and 502s. Refreshing the page seems to fix the issue, but it happens nearly every time I try to send a request

I believe there was a bot that did that when bitcoin was first starting out

Its awful. I got extra money added into my account recently from a transfer error. Called both banks involved, both say "theres nothing wrong on our end, check with [other bank]."

Currently, I see 3 exchanges at 10k. ANX at 10,272, CEX.IO at 10,255, and Okcoins at 10,148

I personally enjoy Gemini, but I started with coinbase, and will still use their app because I enjoy their ui. Gemini was down yesterday too. 
Gemini has a bank account link and instantly credits your account once you deposit USD into it (meaning you can instantly purchase btc or eth). However the downside is you can't withdraw those funds from the exchange until it fully clears (4-5 business days). It also doesnt have a great dashboard imo.

But that doesn't really answer his question. 
As a sort of answer, 
I can think of a lot of reasons why it fluctuates due to cybercriminal use (for example, XMR from cryptomining campaigns -&gt; BTC, BTC-&gt;whatever purchase/currency you want through exchanges that aren't so strict about user verification). 
However, for user purchases, using BTC instead of fiat while still inherently risky, it does add its own level of security. For example, I own some VPS' that I pay for in BTC. While the site I use is trustworthy enough (they won't run off with my money), you can never be too careful in regards to websites getting hacked and PII getting leaked, which is why I pay in BTC. That way, the only thing tying me to the VPS and the only thing at risk in the case of a compromise is my BTC address, which isn't very useful to someone who's going after credit card info.

I mean, from a cyber criminal's perspective, bitcoin and crypto in general is a match made in heaven. Its a globally accepted pseudo-anonymous currency that, in the case of XMR, can be gained with a botnet(each computer is used as a miner). I've been tracking one botnet that even with XMR's price drop recently (2 months ago it was $120 now its $54), its still earning almost $3000 a month. And since the cyber criminal doesnt need to factor in electricity costs, they get all of that money.

Is this the new Nigerian Prince scam? "Hey guys, send me all your btc. I'm a totally trustable source with my -4 karma, and 2 week old account. I promise I'll use your btc for this purpose and not for whatever the fuck i want."
