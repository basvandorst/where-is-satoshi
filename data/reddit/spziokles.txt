It came **mostly from redditors?**
So someone puts paint on a wall and people give money for it, but mostly those who only see it online and would never come near this place.
I mean, it would be much easier and more efficient to not put that paint on a wall but on a digital painting and distribute it directly over the internet.
I understand this would be "wrong" and nobody would have cared for it in that case. It's just something which amazes me, just like the art itself and the story about it.

By "you know that" you probably mean "you heard that".
I don't say you're wrong, but I think a lot of this thread consists of confirmation bias.

This seems like an inappropriate comparison. You compare *one* A to *all* B and by the numbers it looks like A &lt; B, suggesting a false conclusion.
A better comparison would be to compare Bitcoin to *one* specific fiat, or to compare *all* cryptos to *all* fiat.
Either way Bitcoin would look worse which probably is the reason why you chose to put it that way.

If the situation is that there is practically no infrastructure to transport electricity ...
Then it would seem odd to invest heavily in overproduction, hoping that demand will rise in the future instead of investing in lacking infrastructure first.
Why not make a moderate plant with some power lines instead?

To support your claim it is not enough to explain it.
To support your claim that it's the *sole* reason you furthermore have to explain that *all other reasons* don't apply.

This comment has no relation to mine. I wasn't talking about overdosing but about confirmation bias.
While we're at it:


How do you "know exactly what" just because you bought it online?
To gain knowledge, you have to research, not trust. You have to test your substance.
This can be done with both street and online drugs.
I am fully aware that the streets are dirty. I'm not arguing against that.
I simply state that it's not "knowing" because everybody (rightfully) says so.

While [somebody else pointed out another reason for the *why*](
They most likely are right. Most things have multiple causes but we still tend to think of them as being monocausal. But they aren't.

What about weapons? 
Small handguns?
What about selling surveillance technology to opressing regimes?
Selling information which will be used to name and shame someone for their private affairs?
What if you find a merchant which sells you one or all of these products in a country which has no regulation on it?
These are extremes, but your claim was extreme, too.

But we don't even know if Satoshi is male or female, fat or slim, tall or short. The uncertainty is not just about the face.
We don't even know if it's one person or a group.

There is no such thing. Anybody can ask questions.

No, but you're trying to put words into my mouth which I don't appreciate. Won't continue this way.

1. give corporations armed security
2. give governments less power, corporations more
3. have more than one corporation which rival for the same, scarce resource
4. fast forward some decades and imagine a worldly amount of social decay

Nitpicking on "consensus": Doesn't it mean that *all* *agree*? It seems the wrong word two-fold: Neither it's *all*, nor do they *agree*.
The contrary to **"consent"** would be **"dissent"**, which means **to differ in opinion**. 
Since differing opinions are the case, I have doubts if the consensus-argument is convincing.
Alternative wording: use **"majority decision"** or something similar.
I know I'm walking on thin ice here. It's not necessarily my opinion. Feel free to criticise and improve.

Probably not for consumer stuff but rather for raw resources like metals.
Customers would hesitate to enter a warzone restaurant but when it comes to oil, metal and such, we're already acustomed that they are being acquired with more or less violence.
Anyways, what's so special about governments that only they should be able to use violence in an organized manner, say war? Anybody with enough power and ruthlessness can.
