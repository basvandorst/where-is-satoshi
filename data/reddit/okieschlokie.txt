I'm interested in learning what you believe it is. Inflation doesn't imply an increase in money supply, only a decrease in purchasing power.

Nobody would say a currency is experiencing inflation if the supply went up but so did the purchasing power. Inflation necessitates a decrease in purchasing power. It does not necessitate an increase in money supply.

Within a couple of months Bitcoin's annual inflation rate will be 100%+ as well if the current price stays relatively flat.

As far as the "couple months," call it four months if we're going to be nitpicky about accuracy. I don't keep close tabs on price. It just seems shortsighted to say that a currency has gone "down in flames" when it has experienced 186% inflation in the past year since Bitcoin may very well be in that exact position come Dec/Jan.

That analogy won't work in a couple of months.

There is. It's called r/Bitcoin.

I thought Gresham's Law is that "bad money drives out good money."

I believe in you.

The argument that Bitcoin's value is fundamentally backed by the fees that people pay to perform Bitcoin transactions is alarming and itself sounds like a paradox.

Using your analogy, would you say that Whole Foods in the US accepts Euros as payment?

So you're buying bitcoin instead of stocks?
