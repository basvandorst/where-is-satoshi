Don’t try to trade if your not a trader.... You will lose. If you must then don’t do it with your whole stack and try a little at the beginning. It takes awhile to learn and profit nicely. It’s much much easier to lose. Crypto isn’t as predictable as you think.

I’ve told friends they could and then when they look at the fees they are turned off. They will have to buy a lot more to make it worth it but then BTC will have to gain a lot more just to get their fees back and break even. They give up thinking about it. Saying they missed the boat.

Biggest mistake I made was picking Coinspot over Binance in the beginning to buy IOTA cause Bittrex doesn’t offer it. I sold and bought EOS but it’s still there. Since then I’ve moved to Binance but I’ll lose once I transfer out.

1 btc for a flight to Mexico and then 1 btc for money to spend in 2015 while it was around 700 usd. Amazing time but very expensive trip when you look back at it now.

Way more to come... this is just the beginning. Learn the routine, be a bit more conservative and have patience, like step away for around 30 minutes and don’t look and then you’ll make out with a profit.

I think the lesson is you never know. It’s either both honestly. I’ve lost a lot in hodl mode and I’ve gained a lot when I sold at a loss and got in elsewhere although the opposite is also true.

Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin... wouldn’t help to diversify. I myself would pick some alts but if you pick BTC and BCC you are more secure.

Round 2, and then there will be round 3 to 5+. In a well coordinated PND, if not the best ever like we are experiencing, there is never just one serious round. There are multiple.

Buy him the cat rides a unicorn llama shirt that Vitalik wore and maybe a framed poster of one of the cool bitcoin comics we see on here often of the bitcoin going to the moon or the lolcrypto. Reach out to the artist.

ARK, just released Aces within the past 24hrs. It's working tech. Great potential.

More and more I see and read I think 3k might be the btm for bitcoin and 200 for Ether and around 35 for ltc.

Coinbase is best and then put the app on his phone and make sure 2FA is clicked on for all trades. I did this for my Dad and loves talking about it, just gives us something to discus and he feels like he is more part of the news cycle. I just told him to put in like 150 bucks, hope he doesn't get addicted when I'm not there and buy on the highs.

Nepal would be a great country to adopt bitcoin because the county is built on remittances. Hardly any money is allowed outside the country, western union only takes incoming transfers but won’t allow anything to be sent out.  As such a small country they could implement a banking system much more efficiently than their neighbors and their currency could be worth so much more. What a wasted opportunity.

I know! Back then we used to think it was so expensive and we were nuts. I just put myself in the same shoes now when I just bought more today because I’m thinking just the same. But I’ll look back in two years and be like why didn’t I buy more.

Plane tickets back in 2015 and yes I’d like to say I regret it cause those coins would be worth thousands now but the trip was epic and I had already profited nicely.

Nice spread. I would look at SALT. Yes the debate with crypto is you could go all in on BTC but that’s incredibly boring when there are amazing startups out there with great tech on the horizon and doing the due diligence on them is where the fun is at. It’s all a gamble, even stocks are, any investment is, so just expect to lose it all but dream to win big and at the same time be part of something even bigger. I wouldn’t add much more, too many coins is a headache. If you add more then exchange for something else.

1.5 mil or it will be replaced by another crypto which I hate to say is more likely. Usually the first are the ones that are destroyed but remembered for awhile until the next generation comes along and they become so mainstream the prior are forgotten just like MySpace and whatever that first music streaming downloading site there was. But definitely 1.5 mil if not.

Bittrex is by far the best I feel if you can. Kraken is a waste of time trying to use and their verification levels are ludicrous.

This guy is the epitome of the type of people that just don’t get bitcoin for the stupidest of reasons. You just have to give up arguing and realize posts like these are just attention seekers. Nothing you can do to change their mind.

Instantly buy a coin via credit/debit then sell quickly after and put into your usd wallet but you’ll lose money on fees. If you time it right wait a bit and you can hope the market goes up and you will get your fees back. The market always fluctuates so just stare at it and then sell. Best bet or otherwise wait for the transfers.

Wish I could... I remember thinking in 2015 I was behind the times and I was already too late. Which was totally true but I still think jumping in now is early. Although I wasn’t on Reddit in 2015 and there wasn’t such energy.
