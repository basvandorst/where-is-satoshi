I'm pretty sure everyone thought it was an original piece. It is common sense not to pass someone else's work off as your own(stated or implied). When real money is involved this act goes from being a mistake to a legal matter. Even if he gave written credit to the artist it wouldn't matter. Legally he would need some type of release form approved by the artist who owns the copyright. 
It's really unfortunate too because it shows a huge amount of disrespect to everyone involved: the original artist: dron111, the contributing artists, and especially the host of the contest who is putting his/her hard earned money out there to help support the budding Bitcoin community. 
I'm sure that there wasn't any malicious intent from gapmunky, but as an artist myself it scares me to see how easy it is for someone to profit off of someone else's own hard work so easily.
By the way [here is the artist's portfolio on cghub]( it is very impressive.
