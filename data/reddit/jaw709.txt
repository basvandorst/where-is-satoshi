open-source? no license? Can you post a link? Thank you
@_date: 2018-09-27 08:35:44
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:23:58
yep, licensing.. This would be open-source, no cost-to-entry
edit:  not licensed monetarily, you just have to surrender your patents to the "Blockchain Patent Defense License"
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:56:34
Well we clearly disagree on this one. I would say the short-term (and long-term) gains by liberating this particular patent through crowd-sourcing, in this ecosystem and need for adoption, greatly out-weighs the longer-term ideological concerns. And purchasing is not stealing.. 
  
edit:  
  
Also, what if I have no patents to play quid-pro-quo with, can I use it for free? What's the threshold if I do? What patents are worthy? TRULY Open-source it AND remove all barriers to entry by crowd-funding its purchase. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:45:20
Why are miners (not-segwit-activated) still using it covertly then?
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:49:56
I'm still in favor.. I don't know the large mining pools well enough to know the leverage of their existing patents, but certainly securing this patent and open-sourcing, would still be beneficial. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:49:08
So it may still be worth-while for large segwit-activated mining pools with their own patents? hmmm  
  
Also as I say below:  
  
   *I don't know the large mining pools well enough to know the leverage of their existing patents, but certainly securing this patent and open-sourcing, would still be beneficial.* 
It would still achieve all the checkpoints above with liberation from the "Blockchain Patent Defense License"

I'm not sure what you mean? Rebellion to the status-quo is cyclical, necessary, and allows human progress. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:58:35
I see it as the establishment's capitulation, actually. Going from lobbying fiercely against crypto-currency, calling it everything from "Terroristic, Fool's Gold, Fad" to now embracing it.  
  
Let me try to put you at ease, if I might. On-chain transactions will always be the most decentralized and secure, censorship-resistant. These are the properties we care about. When Big Biz. engineers their own solutions, it is another path, not tunnel.  
  
Decentralization is spread across thousands, eventually, millions of nodes that transact, vote with software upgrades, exist independently of the financial hierarchy.  
  
"Ye are many-- they are few"
@_date: 2018-09-02 09:15:12
You're wrong. It's pretty much the gold standard of BTC V BCH. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:06:29
I'm a fan. I think it's important both for institutional adoption, and institutional solution-engineering. It's like the world of crypto: may the most useful product win for its purpose. It will still never supplant the security, decentralization of straight on-chain, or likely the censorship-resistance of lightning Network. I am genuinely proud to be a part of the emerging Crypto-currency paradigm.

1. It doesn't matter your interpretation of the words, they stand simply, and succinctly.  
  
2. Not so much, "communist uprising," entirely, as much as the reaction to "governmental over-reach" and control.  
  
3. I agree, Satoshi wrote the Whitepaper as an avenue elsewhere from the 2008 financial collapse, but you are conflating that with your interpretation the 60's movement was apparently solely anti-capitalistic, and not anti-government. Need I remind you of the Vietnam War, corruption, and "owner of my body" channels?  
  
This meme is not for you, but you are both conflating and centralizing cause-effect.

@_date: 2018-08-03 16:25:03
I agree in part. The co-operation of the currencies would be one avenue, and a potential staging step. If you look at Venezuela, however, it is also borne from necessity.  
  
My curiosity in posting this meme arises from the timing. After lobbying for years against "digital, terroristic, un-traceable" currency, and the stigma associated, seems like a stark reversal.

And I don't know if it will necessarily "compete" with Lightning Network; as i'm sure you've heard Mastercard is an investor in Lightning Labs, for example. My ideal is cooperatively-competitve as we transition to a universally-accepted, decentralized money medium.
  
This is certainly one of the biggest fish in the proverbial financial pond however, and you can bet your buns that it will open the flood-gates via tacit "approval" for others.

@_date: 2019-11-19 20:16:46
To recap: you're a moron. It's a known and prevalent "90s problems  meme" that accurately dissects the value proposition of Bitcoin versus traditional fiat. You use the term "word salad" which denotes unintelligible series of phrases that someone makes when having a stroke. You still fail to accept that just because you don't have the faculties to understand something, that it doesn't make it word salad. MOST people understood it perfectly, clearly not you, which I pray is for a lack of application, not self-induced lobotomy.

JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, OR FAIL TO RESEARCH SOMETHING, DOES NOT MAKE THAT SOMETHING "WORD SALAD."
JUST BECAUSE YOU FIND SOMETHING BORING DOES NOT MAKE THAT SOMETHING WORD SALAD.

My reason being, before the next bull run, I want to know where to apply the pressure to adopt segwit
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:34:54
Once again using words you don't know the meaning of:  it's not "ad hominem" if it's true. You objectively did not know the definition of "word salad" though employed it to undermine the subject matter, let alone nature, of a meme YOU did not understand. You then try to extrapolate this as a grand conclusion that it's universally incomprehensible, and through further discussion reveal yourself to be -yes- a moron. Later gator, don't let the common sense deflate that unearned ego of yours.

Thanks, this has allayed many of my initial fears from the title and the hysteria from commenters earlier this morning. What does this mean for the goals of LN on mainnet to be "instantaneous, nominally feed"?
If that is still true, I'm not sure why this sublayer would be needed?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:25:02
He has been advocating Bitcoin / Litecoin for a while now. Charlie Lee even went on Blaze's Doc Thompson Show for an interview about the subject.  
  
A few months ago, when BTC was bouncing around 4k, he advised "If you have the money to invest, put $500 into Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:33:25
wow, thank you for the insightful response! My only question would be, since the LN basic is still launching and is notably limited by volume, does that mean higher fees will be necessitated until the additional layer is introduced?  
  
It was my understanding that the volume constraint would be managed with multi-chain Lightning Network and cross-chain swaps on BTC / LTC / [segwit]coin block chain. Is this still viable?
Thanks again
@_date: 2019-12-06 06:29:15
Thanks! Will have to check it out again, perhaps I'm due for an upgrade :P :D ;) :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:44:43
Yes but was that not suppose to be the solution for volume and lower fees? (per Charlie Lee's vision) I wonder if this replaces that or runs in parallel to that utility
@_date: 2019-12-23 20:48:36
Sure, not saying there is a way to know-
Statistically, a lump sum (per lopp's analysis) is superior to a DCA for the timeline of his graph. My addition, (I suppose) would be it only makes sense then to buy a near-term dip to maximize return on said lump sum. And no, not almost all the time. I think his graph states 67% historically, and 61% more recently more profitable, far-cry from "*almost* all the time." 
  
And lastly, if you believe where Bitcoin will take us, any lump sum in the near term will yield superior results if your DCA meets global need / adoption, and you're not yet vested satisfactorily.
@_date: 2019-12-06 06:17:06
Perhaps dumb Q, but how did you do four symbols on the card? It only let me apply one? This was approximately, 4 months back?
@_date: 2019-12-23 01:56:51
Concur! The base / Layer 1 is certainly the settlement layer of Bitcoin- what I'll reiterate is what you had in mind AS the software scaling alternative in lieu of Lightning network?
@_date: 2019-12-23 15:40:44
Flummoxed.. how do you NOT know when there is a dip? Or, perhaps you missed the point of lopp's post? Empirically, ANY lump sum has seen a higher percent chance of positive return (through its posting) than a DCA.  
with enough time preference, many expect this to go to 100% for those that buy today, "we're still early," is the refrain.
@_date: 2019-12-23 01:39:34
Oh sweet, what did you have in mind? I'm talking for scaling without perpetually increasing the blocksize (like those hill trolls from the BCash camp? :P)
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:30:15
Spectacular, thank you!

And it may be the safest way for a segment of the population to gain exposure (and appreciation) from Bitcoin e.g. ETF, managed wallets, multi-sigs between yourself and institutions etc.
@_date: 2019-12-23 03:40:28
Hmm I do believe that was before the emergence of channel factories? That with schnorr, batching, an array of trust-minimized (albeit pseudo-custodial) solutions, I hope will do the trick.  
Definitely don't think there is consensus for a block size increase, and some think we may very well need to reduce its size ultimately (fees, lack of individual TxNs)

Gresham's law.. Bitcoin being the soundest of "digital gold" all other shit-coins e.g. litecoin, vertcoin, dgbite, Bcash, Bcash 2 etc. will all give up monetary terrirory to it, and that costs you potential BTC (what everyone is after.)
Shit-tokens e.g. ETH, lisk, neo, eos (literally everything else that's not competing to be money) has no purpose because most smart contracts require oracles (external input) invalidating need for a blockchain, OR the Apps, use-cases would be better served on a centralized database and never needed a blockchain.

yes-- we are talking about the same thing. When you open a channel you go on chain-- I just never conceptualized for some reason it is kept open via UTXO.  
  
I am wondering now how large the utxo set will become relative to the open-channel volume. Also, when the channel is closed, if an additional fee needs to be included for spending, where does that come from? thanks in adv

@_date: 2018-11-04 13:38:14
Got it! Thanks to **In short, it is dependent on how the channel is closed (by unilateral or mutual).**
Funding transaction:  
  
    An irreversible on-chain transaction that pays to both peers on a channel. It can only be spent by mutual consent. (multi-sig)
Commitment transaction:  
  
    A transaction that spends the funding transaction. Each peer holds the other peer's signature for this transaction, so that each always has a commitment transaction that it can spend. After a new commitment transaction is negotiated, the old one is revoked.
Closing transaction:  
  
    A transaction generated as part of a mutual close. A closing transaction is similar to a commitment transaction, but with no pending payments.
Mutual close:  
  
    A cooperative close of a channel, accomplished by broadcasting an unconditional spend of the funding transaction with an output to each peer (unless one output is too small, and thus is not included).
Unilateral close:  
  
    An uncooperative close of a channel, accomplished by broadcasting a commitment transaction. This transaction is larger (i.e. less efficient) than a mutual close transaction, and the peer whose commitment is broadcast cannot access its own outputs for some previously-negotiated duration.
@_date: 2018-11-04 17:35:37

@_date: 2018-11-09 17:47:19
I meant in virtue of "ambiguity of identity", not to be righteously permitted or not permitted to literally cast his character. Should be taboo "because" "Dorian is an actual real person who was harmed by the undue attention." (among other negatives like idol worship a la CSW; the fact it cheapens the legacy etc.) It's not a perfect analogy ;/
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:35:21
A linear problem with an evolutionary solution, you mean?
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:22:37
A UTXO is not exactly just a balance, but a little more involved:  
  
"Unspent Transaction Output) spendable bitcoins. A transaction output lists a bitcoin amount and the conditions (called an encumbrance) that need to be fulfilled in order to spend those bitcoins. Once those bitcoins have been spent on the blockchain, no other transaction in the same blockchain can spend the same bitcoins, so an Uspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is bitcoins that can be spent."
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:38:53
Is the on-chain utxo updated with commitment data or is it all stored off-chain within LN nodes or wallets? Or am I way off base?
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:00:40
Haha missed the sarcasm the first time

 on any one chain

Presumption of innocence / privacy. As long as he is following all election law in reporting, then it is moot. It is not our business. If he becomes Senator of Missouri, and is required to disclose, then we will know.  
  
Your contradiction is apparent when you state you are not attacking his finances, and then imply he is preaching "for profit." If you cannot see how these are inextricably linked, then I think we are done here.  
  
If every policy-maker had to disclose 100% of his / her investments before talking on any relevant economic issue, that would be the problem. Until then, yep: none of our business.

Sure, "exclusive" may be a bit inflated, but he was speaking extemporaneously. The Fed, however, certainly does have a disproportionate, centralized impact like no other entity within the US government, or globe.

Scaling via blocksize is what I meant as linear. It's unchanging, uncolorful. Layer 2 is option driven, adaptable.

Or it could work the other way and they say "we are going to only trade X effective X" and that would sway the market, incentivize, disincentivize the miners whose goal is profit?

You are welcome! :) I was a crypto-noob as of a few months ago, and initially my main fascination was the allure of a cashless, borderless currency. I started researching the BIP XXX debates recently, and what I discovered is a rich philosophical discussion within crypto communities about existential problems and how to constructively solve them for the optimal utilitarian, moral approach.    
  
I started in June with Litecoin, and researching Lightning Network, and just recently saw a post today discussing the dilemma of blocksize and scalability. Realizing Lightning Network and Segwit has already solved this, I took it upon my boney shoulders to get out the good word! 
  
edit: Wow! just saw your linked post. Great Job! We are in this together-- we all want to see Crypto become utilitarian, spendable to unite the world under a practicable, user-friendly construct. We need to keep up the information campaign, and with a conciliatory but informed tone. 
  
edit 2: yes! It looks like your other post was the catalyst for research, posting: 
 @_date: 2017-07-16 18:42:49
LN is the "variably priced" "Toll roads" addressed as the proven solution, and this is the premise of LN (and as a bonus it makes transactions off-chain and super-quick!) As for Segwit, it's about malleability, in this iteration, akin to "bridges" to allow BTC and LTC to share the road.

@_date: 2017-07-16 20:00:50
Check out this post I wrote up yesterday. It's also about unsustainably high BTC Network fees, transaction times, lack of competition, and the need to drive down those on-chain transaction times with LN. Lightning Network, if implemented correctly, addresses all of these problems by using LTC as a Roadway and synergistic coin:

@_date: 2017-07-17 17:36:21
Ah, so you're one of them BTC Maximalists? I feel sorry for you, really. It's like the xenophobic version Crypto..  
  
Lightning Network in practice requires Segwit both for security and for malleability, inter-operability with LTC. You could have LN without segwit, but the devs quit working on that forever ago. Why? Because it doesn't make sense NOT to have a competitive, faster, more secure version WITH segwit integrated. I think you need to go back to whatever backwoods shack you plug your dick into and see if you can't google-up "Future of Cryptocurrency." You are going to be sad, but then you'll just lash out with misinfo and venom like you tried to do here, in attempt to remain relevant. Awww, but BTC Classic died with Satoshi and you're still masturbating with his ashes. GTFO
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:02:45
Sure, but that's when the coins were uniform. Now were have a problem where they will not be created equally or accepted equally, especially if the non-segwit activated hardfork coins could not ride on Lightning Network-- which is the payment system of crypto future. I think we're talking about the same thing, just have different perspectives.
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:09:22
I believe the free market and incentive for people to both manage LN Nodes for profit and save time, money by utilizing it, will make it prosperous in the mid-term future. I don't think it will be over-night, nor will it be a flash-in-the-pan. The fundamentals are there, and it solves multiple crippling problems at once which will inherently promote its use barring any catastrophic production problems.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:57:17
You are absolutely correct. The On-chain exchange trading will still be quite possible, though will be seen as an archaic, expensive option. No one will use it (electively) because who'd rather crawl than fly? @_date: 2017-07-16 19:14:15
Sure! 
  
"LN nodes will charge a fee for LN txns going through them and that fee will be relative to the Bitcoin network fee." 
Lightning Network is going to utilize nodes to channel off-chain traffic from higher congested avenues to less congested avenues, but it will be the path of cheapest resistance. In the Wired article, it stated the proven solution in several prohibitively populated cities was to utilize a toll road to alleviate pressure on the traffic, and that these toll roads are flexibly priced based on congestion, need. Similarly, this is the concept with flexible demand node pricing. 
  
Segwit, allows interfacing and inter-operability between BTC and LTC since they both utilize the technology. Charlie says these "Bridges" will allow both LTC and BTC coins to migrate traffic patterns within the Nodes in effort to find the cheapest, fastest, most efficient route.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:00:29
That's not a flaw it's called free market principles. If that happened then conversely Bitcoin would have less fees and would be the preferred toll lane of traffic. The idea is that they would be cooperatively competitive. That is indeed the entire premise. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:28:11
The Wired magazine article acknowledges that it is not a perfect 1 to 1 ratio, but the proven solution with "variably priced" "toll roads" is exactly how Lightning Network intends to alleviate the crisis. I am sure it is more nuanced, but there's enough approximate evidence for me to say this is the next, best solution.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:54:56
no but that's not what I'm saying, either. They could be doing a power move and saying "we will not accept X coin on X date" enough big exchanges do that, game over. Miners would not continue mining the value-less coin because they know they would not be bought, traded, and therefore have no continued value. Another Exchange would have to be funded, marketed, and acquire users for a parallel market, and those coins would have to have some realworld utility from merchants. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:22:46
Great! I want to add it's also a bit broader in promise and integration than just a scaling debate. That is the service that Lightning Network will bring with integration via Segwit and Litecoin: it's just as important, as detailed here:  
  
  
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:19:58
No, the problem is unsustainably high on-chain fees and transaction times due to BTC Network traffic. LN is off-chain with appreciably less fees due to the transactions seeking competitive, faster rates from nodes. You certainly do not want to see BTC network full of cars if you're attempting to process transactions or have anywhere to get to in less than 10 minutes to an hour. please review:  
  
  
  
and

No worries man, I understand the reticence, we just disagree.  
  
Faster than the existing On-chain network, cheaper than existing on-chain, and more convenient than logging in and purchasing from an exchange once Atomic Swap is implemented. and I have been all over this post tonight, read through it and let us know if you have any questions
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:37:25
Okay, that's a pretty broad-scope analysis, and I don't disagree. I am just using Charlie's own vision and synthesizing it with the "Induced Demand" problem via scaling with this analogy! :)  
  
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:23:37
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:28:03
That's all dependent on how many users, merchants adopt it after it launches, the ease of use of the GUI for the App, and the incentive for users to run LN nodes. We shall see, but as I say, the fundamentals are there: Faster, cheaper, more convenient.

I think you're confusing prevent with restrict. restrict means that it's not impossible, at least intially, but there are hurdles to overcome that are prohibitive to most people.

But that would take an incredible amount of capital to accomplish, though. It's cost-prohibitive at least initially to go out of your way to finance an exchange and then market it, get a user base.. etc
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:35:36
oh, now that's something new I have not heard here. What are the consensus rules? Where do miners sell their mined coins to?
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:56:49
so that's where the "hard forks" come in, which doesn't reconcile my question as to what if the exchanges decided they were only going to accept segwit-activated coins
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:13:05
"You may want it, but its price is prohibitive. Prohibitive originally referred to something (often a law) that prohibits or forbids something, but came to mean conditions (often prices or taxes) so high or great they restrict or prevent something"

@_date: 2017-07-18 05:04:51
yea, but like, if they decide "we are only going to trade segwit-activated coins" then miners would have to or have more incentive to mine then, right?

Isn't Segwit anti-spam integrated? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:04:01
Incorrect, however to your other point, lightning Network requires the coin to be segwit activated in order to be interoperable and swap efficiently while preserving data. Other altcoins simply do not have the same data architecture and will not be lightning Network viable.
