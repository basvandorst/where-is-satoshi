Hasn't gone down once? Really?

That could be, but OP said "Uncorrelated asset which is scare and hasn't gone down once." Seems pretty obvious the "hasn't gone down" was referring to the network. OP never once says network. 
And sure, owning no bitcoin is a risk. But so is owning bitcoin. Life is all about risk.

Easy. The new coin becomes the cryptocurrency that people flock to, that the average beer drinking guy decides to buy, that businesses begin to accept, that begins to recieve the mythical "institutional money" that is supposed to send Bitcoin to the moon. The new coin (deeply flawed as it may be) blows up and Bitcoin slides into oblivion as first the whales dump it to cut their losses, then the casual holders convert their holdings into the new coin, and the hodlers are left holding the bag.
This is not so different to what happened to Betamax. It was technically a better system than VHS with a decent amount of success (and a good sized network) until it lost its air supply and quickly died on the vine.
I don't know how likely this scenario is, but to me (a disinterested observer) it does seem quite possible.

Thanks for this response. This is exactly what I was hoping for when I made the post. You make a good point about the infrastructure necessary to sustain a bitcoin-based economy versus a fiat-based economy. I hadn't thought of it that way. I also appreciate your take on the energy problem. If I may paraphrase you, I understand your position as "it's a trade off and the benefits are (or will be) worth the costs". I've always found it strange that people would deny it and claim it was an non-issue, yet so much mining is done in China, Iceland, and washington state (for example) with access to cheap power.
I understand now the miscommunication (or confusion) I had regarding speed-vs-capacity. I don't think there is really a speed problem with bitcoin. I know that when I deposit something at my bank, it is available immediately, but that's really only an interest-free loan from them to be (because I've been a good customer for a long time). Your discussion about centralization vs. decentralization is fascinating. It is almost a tradeoff (if I'm understanding this correctly) between convenience and security. The more centralized the system is, the more vulnerable it is to bad actors. That is one thing I haven't seen analyzed about the Lightning Network. Like any new system, it will have security issues, but I don't know how vulnerable it really is. Maybe no one does.
Thanks for taking the time to respond and educate me. It was fascinating.

Thanks for the advice. I didn't know about that book. Just ordered it.

Yeah, I'll buy the bit about bank coins. But a government coin would have most of the benefits of Bitcoin and would "feel" safer to most people. And yes, Bitcoin does have more value the more it's used, but I feel like something else could easily come around. Bitcoin isn't indispensable yet.

Serramonte Mall is in Daly City, not South San Francisco.

His argument makes no sense. He means, essentially, that in 20 years bitcoin will be 30 therefore it will replace gold. What?
Here’s my argument. In 8 years, everyone under 30 will have never known a world without Furby. It may as well be a God-King. That’s the long-term case for furry robot enslavement.

I don't think I agree. Whether something is "legitimate" or not is in the eye of the beholder. People invest based on their beliefs, not on some kind of ground truth.

The market can remain irrational a lot longer than you can remain solvent.

I would agree that current crypto users are conservative. I would disagree about new crypto users not jumping on something issued by a central bank as it would appear safer to them (not arguing it would be, frankly I don't know).
And the deliberate design decisions are appropriate for a "store of value" but not a currency. The VISA network can execute many orders-of-magnitude more transactions than Bitcoin can. The only way that I can see is to insert trusted middlemen (essentially a VISA or Mastercard for Bitcoin) and I really don't think that would fly.

Thanks for your answer. I've been thinking about it and I disagree with you re: the energy problem. If Bitcoin were to become the de facto world currency the "brick-and-mortar " energy parts would remain. This means to compare Bitcoin to fiat you need to ignore the common energy sinks. So I don't think including the brick-and-mortar part is appropriate. I've studied this a lot and the power problem is real (if exaggerated). Even the founder of Ethereum agrees and he biased NOT to agree.
The capacity problem isn't inherent to digital systems. It is inherent to the blockchain. Big difference.
How is the speed problem non-existent? During the mania of 2017 the system slowed to a crawl. It transactions were still much, much lower than would be expected of a currency.
I'm not saying these problems don't have solutions. However, trying to explain them away doesn't actually make them go away. I assume you're a Bitcoin investor. Therefore, examine your own biases. I've tried really hard to be neutral (I don't own Bitcoin) and my conclusion is that the structural issues are quite real. Some of them are on purpose (the blockchain size, and the energy problem, although I'm not sure the inventor(s) of the protocol thought the consequences of PoW through).

I agree. It could also kill Bitcoin. I get the feeling from a lot of Bitcoin boosters that their favorite cryptocurrency is a tide rising that the entrenched interests, try as they might, have no chance to hold back. I think they are wrong.

But those emails!

Totally agree with what you said. But why does the coin have to be Bitcoin? It could be some as-yet-uninvented coin that solves some of Bitcoin's inherent issues. So, cryptocurrency could take over AND Bitcoin could go to zero. That is what my question is about.
