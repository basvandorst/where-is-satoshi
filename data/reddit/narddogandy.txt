I understand exactly how Nicehash works. If you understand Bitcoin, you know you're taking a large risk by having any bitcoin tied up in a system that you don't own the private keys for. It doesn't really matter what scheme your bitcoin are tied up in. If they're not in a properly secured private wallet, they don't belong to you. Whether people were waiting to be paid or not is irrelevant.

Just tell your friend that the specifics about your finances are personal, but you do own bitcoin. Is there any legitimate reason they need to know exactly how many bitcoin you own? Not speaking candidly about your personal finances isn't lying, it's just good practice. Let's say you own 50btc and 1btc reaches $100,000. Suddenly you have millions of dollars. Falling into money can put strain on personal relationships in ways you may not expect. 
Edit: You could also suggest to this friend that if they do buy bitcoin, they too should not tell people how many they own.

There's a lot of ways to go about doing this. I was just looking for cold storage, so I opted to use [Tails]( to generate a wallet using Electrum. If you're looking for good security and the ability to spend easily, I would opt for a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor. There are a ton of youtube demonstrations and video tutorials on how to set these up.

Oh, fuck off. Nobody "deserves" to have their coins stolen from using an online wallet, but one of very first things you learn if you bother to read about the bitcoin you're buying is that your bitcoin isn't safe unless you store it in a private, securely generated wallet. If you invest in *anything* without learning about how it works, prepare to lose your ass. If I swim in shark infested water with steaks attached to my body, there's a good chance I'll be bitten by a shark.

I'm just pointing out that people had their bitcoin wrapped up in a system where there's a high risk of being able to lose it, and it's unsurprising that the btc were stolen. Read the post I was responding to again:


I even went out of my way to say nobody 'deserves' to have their bitcoin stolen. With all of the newbies investing their hard earned dollars into Bitcoin, the correct thing to do in this situation is to point out how you can lose your bitcoin if you don't hold the private keys.
This 'hack' exposes an already apparent vulnerability in trusting services like this. It's not 'victim blaming' to highlight this issue.

That doesn't matter. You said multiple times that cell phones are more secure than laptops. I gave a clear example of how this is misleading to say. 


Once again, your personal practices determine how secure your electronic device is, regardless of whether it's a laptop or mobile device. If you're storing Bitcoin on a phone full of soundboard apps, random games, lightsaber apps and other bullshit from the app store, as many people do, a cell phone has just as much opportunity to become compromised as your 'average' laptop.

I'm not saying never put your money into an online exchange. Some exchanges you can have good faith in because they have policies in place in the event of a security breach.
For example, Coinbase:






They're at least somewhat transparent about the way they handle your funds and what they do to prevent this type of theft from occurring or causing you personal loss. 
NiceHash apparently had a .01 btc target you had to hit before you could withdraw. Other pools have a lower withdrawal threshold, so your btc don't have to stay locked into their system for as long.  Perhaps there needs to be a community standard of transparency amongst these companies or something. If you don't know what their opsec looks like, you just shouldn't do business with them. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:08:21


Except I specifically said nobody 'deserves' to have their coins stolen. People can vent, but how is everyone else supposed to react to their venting? Avoid pointing out the problems that allowed this to happen? Not talking about what allowed this to occur would be doing a disservice to bitcoin and all of the new people who have been buying into bitcoin. Hell, even folks who have owned bitcoin for a good while don't realize the dangers in using third party wallets. Nobody is telling anyone they can't vent.

Apparently it's been a [gray area]( because there's no specific designation for cryptocurrencies, but the IRS has been asked about whether crypto [qualifies or doesn't qualify]( for 1031 and hasn't said anything. Qualifying for 1031 means you have to claim it as well, so I'm wondering how many people *have* claimed 1031 for intercurrency exchanges. So yeah, this tax bill does seem to rule out 1031 exemptions whereas before, it wasn't clear or defined. Either way, the method I describe above appears to make intercurrency exchange taxation unenforceable. I'm not suggesting anyone try to screw the IRS because it's a bad idea, but I'm just wondering how they're going to track anyone who feels like hiding transactions.

I'm not blaming victims by pointing out that losing bitcoin you don't have privately secured is an inherent risk no matter what the situation is. Like I said, nobody *deserves* to lose bitcoin for not having it privately secured, but if it's lost, don't be too surprised. Buying into a service like this, you're placing a lot of blind trust in someone else to make good on their agreement to keep your investment safe while you're waiting to hit the payout target and to pay you what you're owed when the time comes.

If you're copy pasting it, that means you have stored on your phone or the internet in plain text, which is terrible practice.


This is absolutely a possibility and something to consider when storing bitcoin on your phone.


This is a great time to point out that your BTC is only as secure as your personal practices allow it to be, regardless of the device. Some people don't lock their phone and have their app store autosaved. Some people have jailbroken phones which compromises security. Did you put a pin on your wallet?


*As far as you know*. We're talking about securing bitcoin. There's a *huge* bounty right now for people to develop malware for all electronic devices that might store bitcoin. If I were a malware developer, my main goal right now would be to find exploits that allow me to steal crypto. Unless your phone is permanently air gapped, don't assume it's any more secure for the purpose of Bitcoin storage than a laptop. Anything connected to the internet is at risk for remote compromise. 


If I'm running an air gapped laptop with a checksum verified instance of tails and I sign a transaction offline, that flashdrive/laptop is indisputably more secure than an internet connected smartphone.
If you really want to have security: A paper wallet or a hardware wallet.
Also, better hope you have your private key backed up somewhere when you drop your iPhone in the toilet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:29:41


Bitcoin storage on a third party wallet is obviously not equivalent to my employer's bank account. 


The condition is that cryptocurrency is extremely vulnerable to anonymous theft if not secured properly, so one should understand this before getting into cryptocurrency. Once again, people don't 'deserve' to have their bitcoin stolen, but if they don't have the private keys, it's a reasonable expectation that they can be stolen. You remember Mt. Gox, right? 


Mt. Gox was stolen from and because Mt. Gox was robbed, they couldn't make good on their debts. Mt. Gox was 'hacked', just like Nicehash was 'hacked'. It's extremely analogous because in both situations, customer bitcoin were in the possession of a third party. Everyone who hadn't yet received payouts yet and thought they owned the amount of Bitcoin they were owed were engaging in the crypto equivalent of counting their chickens before they hatch.


You're right. It's not a vulnerability with Bitcoin, it's a vulnerability with third party crypto storage.


So for *this* employer/nicehash equivalency to actually make sense, we'd have to assume my employer only pays me in bitcoin that they personally hold. If I engaged in this type of payment scenario, I'd want to know what storage method they use to secure their bitcoin. If they said "Well, our private keys are stored on a server connected to the internet and we'll only pay you once you hit certain targets." I would immediately realize that by working for them, there's a real risk that they won't have bitcoin to pay me with at some point because it was all stolen by a hacker. If you take a risk, there's a possibility that you can get burnt. Now you can see that working with mining pools like this carries a risk.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:01
I would never do this because it might become illegal tax dodging, but hypothetically, what is to stop someone from using a non US based VPN and Tor to exchange for Monero on a non US based converter along the lines of shapeshift.io and back into a clean cryptocurrency wallet of any denomination. How would anyone be able to prove who is doing the exchanges? Presumably, decentralized anonymous exchanges will spring up as well.
