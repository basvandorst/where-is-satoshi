I almost called you out on linking a printer friendly version, until i re-read your comment and saw that you had corrected yourself.

The volatility seems to be due to the low volume at this point. I think it will stabilize as more is generated and popularity spreads. A week ago it was almost up to 30 and now it's at 16 so i'm thinking of buying right now.

Wow for a second i thought "NewEgg has a California version of their website!?"
I feel dumb.

I have thought about this, but i guess i haven't really done enough research into mining.
How long would it take a $1,000 machine to mine one bitcoin? (i know its not quite that simple but a rough idea would still help me out)

No I won't. The biggest factor of my hesitancy to get involved last year was my lack of funds. I was working 30 hours a week as a barista and didn't really have a savings or any money to set aside at the time. 
Now I've got a better job, an emergency fund in a savings account, and some more experience with money management!

If you've got a bank account that lets you log in online then you can try coinbase. you will have to enter all your bank info but it's widely considered safe. Initial transaction takes about 4-5 days but after that i hear it only takes an hour or so. All transactions are considered valid at the current Bitcoin value disregarding fluctuation.

That wasn't the sole point of my post although now I can definitely see how it sounded.
I guess what i'm saying is that it took a slap in the face like that registering for me to even consider it a usable currency, and now I feel like i'm playing catch up. Playing catch up because I am trying to learn more about it, how it works, how to handle it, how to transer and how to protect it etc...
So much as changed since then! I was considering getting a gaming computer that would double as a mining rig! haha.

Can you explain coin coloring more? I'm still out of the loop. Is that related to all these other cryptocurrencies like litecoin?
If you cant or don't want to type it out can you recommend a good resource to learn about it?

I ALWAYS felt like I didn't have enough money to put into and 'unsure' thing like bitcoin. 
Yes bitcoin may have been an unsure thing but also i'm much more financially wise now and I look at my stupid spending habits back then, how I definitely did have enough money. I was just spending like somebody who didn't think about whether or not they needed money next week.
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:57:39
While yes it should be, I understand why it is... Because people are greedy.
This may be a cynical point of view but in my mind I imagine politicians saying "lets make financial education mandatory! No nevermind, then we won't make any money off student loans and poor credit decisions by the educated"

Thanks for the reply, I learned a lot and I really appreciate it. Not so sure i understand all the algorithm talk behind the different coins and stuff but i'd be greedy to ask all the other questions I have. I'll do some more research.
Thanks again.

I'm not an expert but hasn't it been expressed that this is one of the bigger downsides of bitcoin at the moment? The volatility and lack of places to spend it leads to people hording which only reinforces the volatility and lack of places to spend it.

It really doesn't help that personal finance and budgeting classes aren't mandatory in middle school/highschool. The only thing I learned about it in middle school was a brief "this how to to write a check/balance a checkbook" which took maybe a week.
Nothing about saving money, nothing about investments, bonds, stocks, spending, emergency funds, auto loans, home loans, mortgages, health care etc....

Oh my god the Explain it like i'm 5 did it! That's fucking brilliant! that'd never crossed my mind. Thank you.
One more quick question if you don't mind. You seem to have a good grasp of what's going on and it's hard to find an honest answer on the internet sometimes. Whats the general consensus on Litecoin? Do people see it as practical? Is there a good reason behind it? I've read a little bit about it and seen a lot of mixed reviews. If you could sum it up in about as much space as you used explaining coin coloring I would be extremely thankful!
Also: i'm starting to enjoy this subreddit a lot. Not very much bullshit from what i can tell.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:44:11
Yea, not to one up you or anything, but i definitely remember hearing about it and looking it as impractical around the 3 or 4 dollar mark. Then i saw it rising and made this post. 
I'm waiting for a very small purchase to clear at the moment. I still don't have much to invest but at least it's kind of cool to be involved in someway at this point.

How do you buy bitcoin? I'm new and i'm waiting for coinbase to figure their shit out. How do you buy in 1 hr?
