Hi there!
CoinGate is a great option for accepting Bitcoin with WHMCS - unlike many other payment gateways, we always make sure to make our plugin compatible with the latest cart version. We also offer instant conversion of BTC into USD/EUR for payouts into your bank account or PayPal.
Feel free to drop a line at support if you'd like more info or see how our gateway works on other websites that already use our WHMCS plugin.

I can recommend 
They support quite a few e-Commerce plugins and have great customer support. CoinGate does not limit processing volumes and offer payouts to EUR, USD or let you keep Bitcoin. Oh and their fee is flat 1% without any additional fees for payouts, transfers, etc.
Plugins supported (from their website): WooCommerce, Magento, Magento 2, OpenCart, PrestaShop, osCommerce, VirtueMart, WHMCS, ZenCart

Good point, but it really depends on the payment processor in terms of how they settle a payment. It would be awesome if this comparison included how each payment processor settles their conversion rate, if such information is available. 
For example, since Coinbase has its own exchange with a large volume, they settle their merchant orders using their own exchange - and it works for them well because they don't have to pay additional fees on exchange orders. I checked out CoinGate as well, since they are a lesser known payment processor with a seemingly great price, and they settle orders by obtaining the best real-time price from 3 different exchanges. Clearly, it's a much fairer way to go from the customer's point of view. I'm a bit dissapointed with BitPay, since they very openly claim to be using what they call 'Bitcoin Best Bid rate', which is evidently not the best you can get.

Great work! It's surprising that no one has actually yet taken a closer look at this, because this is kind of big, in my opinion. 
In the case when a payment processor adds a 'hidden fee', the customer is really at a disadvantage because he is forced to assume the exchange fee. You could really compare this to credit cards... it would be ridiculous if the end user, rather than the merchant, had to pay an additional 3% fee on top of the price of the invoice, simply for using a credit card.
