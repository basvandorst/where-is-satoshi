LOL what a ridiculous fallacy. why don't you sell your coins and spend your time elsewhere then if you can't wait for more irl adoption?
also have you even asked any of the 5 bars near you?

hello bitcoin, how was life in the future?
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:22:17
[not entirely untrue](
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:44:58
it's fake ofc and even if true that wouldn't make a difference because chinese know how to find workarounds.
they've been using ecurrencies for a long time.
volatility is normal in a small market full of inexperienced panickers trying to daytrade. [similar things happen irl]( sometimes.

how can your 0.1btc not be spent on anything you want?
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:42:43
"*from* the middle east" you mean?
good point, i totally forgot that. damn, even I'm already brainwashed into thinking terrorists = muslims.
yeah most terrorism in europe and US comes from right-wing nationalist groups. those might indeed be a problem.
i if we're lucky they would all just move into a couple of small areas that they control where they can live happily without seeing any colorful people until they die out due to incest.

the MPAA or something like that came up with the name. the pirates simply adopted it to ridicule the MPAA.
and one of their main principles is to not give a flying fuck about ad hominem attacks, because they are fucking illogical.
if they start changing their name to get more votes they'll next be changing their politics to get more votes and 10 years later they would be as corrupt as the other parties.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:31:52
yeah nationalists have a great track record of telling the truth.
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:00:46
the pirate party is similar to bitcoin :p
nobody understands it, they find solutions through consensus by evaluating logical points instead of blindly following some ideology and then vote on it.
and they are getting a lot of bad press from mainstream media and disruption/derailing from trolls :p

yes but if they agreed to skype they couldn't say that mark's a bad person for refusing to visit them and stupid retarded noobs wouldn't post these news to reddit.

no, the lie was invented by two bit idiot. mark never confirmed that number. or did he?

wow, that's a shame for NZ. they seem like a cool country but have massive surveillance issues. but maybe kim's party will make people more aware of these things and they'll both grow.
NZ was already part of [echelon](

well, you can do it, but also make clear how unreliable it is, i.e. it can be actively faked to translated to literally anything.

you better be joking.

aaron schwarz and bradley manning too iirc, and they weren't selling anything.
note that this shouldn't be about whether what they did was right or wrong, but rather the fact that using wget counts as illegal computer manipulation or w/e it is called.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:36:18
yeah fuck the chinese because it's their fault redditors are incredibly naive.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:18:07


exactly! except in the US!


well, bradley is. aaron got away.


no, read aaron's wiki page and the one about his case. "two counts of wire fraud and 11 violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution and supervised release."
the initial (state) charges were dropped so the government could prosecute him for those hacking charges.
bradley was also charged extra because assange told him how to wget.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:00:41
i don't think it's crucial for mining in the US but yeah it's ridiculous.
do farmers have to pay taxes when their animals reproduce?
maybe that "tax attorney" was wrong there anyway?

someone should repost this text without the last retard line so we can delete this post before giving anymore karma to that douche.

yeah just realized and edited. thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:15:41
there are still 195 other recognized countries in the world so i think chances are it will be widely adopted in a timely manner by a sufficiently large group of people no matter how the US regulates it.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:06:45
ok, well I'm not into economy and not american, i just use bitcoin. i think if the value crashes then miners can write it off or something. remember they only have to pay taxes once a year, not right after mining.
no idea, but I'm pretty sure that this tax dude was bullshitting out of ignorance or to spread FUD because it just makes no sense.
do you guys have to pay taxes e.g. when you harvest apples from apple trees even if you don't sell or eat them?
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:43:51
how would the fiat money receiver know that the giver didn't fake the fiat money?
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:21:40
didn't that story happen *after* mtgox stopped withdrawals? in that case it would be consistent with the report that most coins were stolen after mtgox shut down.
@_date: 2014-03-26 10:21:25
so that's why cops always freak out when you film them - they fear copyright violations and piracy, not physical violations and privacy!
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:03:13
exchanges would be run illegally and you'd find street dealers like in argentine.
and people would use exchanges in other countries if *using* them stays legal.
and people would use p2p exchanges if using those stays legal too.
less daytrading is good anyway, p2p exchanges have a lot less volatility during times of price explosions/crashes.
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:15:16
NSA takes what NSA wants. bitcoin is only used by terrorists and drug dealers so the constitution doesn't apply to them, and companies are paid for sharing data.
and then nobody does anything with that data because there's far too much of it until they need it for public humiliation or worse.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:01:16
you are the one bringing up all sorts of fallacies here.
schwartz was not facing prison for downloading the articles (minor offense) but for hacking because he used wget in his "keepgrabbing.py" script.
that made all the difference, and it was similar in bradley's case.
now go back to watching faux news you fucking damage control agent provocateur or ignorant murrican.


@_date: 2014-03-27 12:18:21
well it's not really your government's fault that people here are so stupid and fall three times for the same lie that was ridiculous from first day on.
many peolpe here also think thailand or taiwan banned bitcoin, it even says so on wikipedia.
people are stupid and governments will keep abusing this for propaganda as long as people are stupid.
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:14:41
so what? most of us don't want to go to the US either, and he would be suicidal to do so.
the US is a country where using "wget" can get you into prison for decades.
they are random, insane and do what they want.

@_date: 2014-03-26 21:19:55
[actually that's a misconception.](
I'm pretty sure &gt;99% of terrorists would quit their jobs if western countries stopped interfering in the middle east.
heck, it was [CIA money]( and [western propaganda]( that brought al quaeda to power in the first place!

well, it happens. maybe some shills started it and people who felt insulted joined in, and maybe some people who are angry because i insulted other people will join in too because insults are a no-no on reddit :p
don't worry, other good posts in this threads got upvotes so it's fine.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:32:24
i know many other countries fail too.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:31:55
that's good. flood reddit with so much misinformation that people stop listening to this shit and only buy because they see value in the protocol and sell because they need fiat.
bad daytraders, fuck off!
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:49:49
wouldn't be anonymous. many people think that you can use something bitcoin-like for voting and so did i before *really* thinking about it, but it's not the best solution and probably even impossible.
the problem with online voting is: it must be anonymous (impossible to buy/blackmail votes), and it must be secure (impossible to fake votes).
[online voting could be done]( with an SMPC machine if someone manages to build one that can do PGP operations. it's just a matter of time until someone does that :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:35:23
but these posts are already being spammed multiple times a day. i think you can slow down a bit.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:23:28
maybe mark spent too much time on reddit and started believing all the rumors about mtgox being a ponzi :p
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:34:28
yes, it is against all tools that help you access information, not wget in particular. sorry if that wasn't clear.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:46:30


the reason is that we aren't dicks :p
