It was checked by person. He phoned me to double check the logo, as he recognized B as my name initials, and I immediately accepted his explanation..

Just a thought: Why on earth do someone here on r/Bitcoin offer reward in $$? I thought this was a place of BTC ambasadors..

to bottom up, I used MS paint. Also double hecked with CS for possible shades in white.. so, i think i know, what i'm doing. The original jpeg posted in imgur had a thumbnal and exiff, thumbnail was censored also, and exif camera info only, without GPS info. But anyway, imgur drops exif.
Nice try ;)

that's not hotspot. hotspot is an uneven temperature of IC surface, which is clearly seen from a video. and also a curtain of vapor passing by the upper chips can not contribute to the heat dissipation. I certanly would not use such this design.

But.. there's another risk: it is posible to fight bitcoin by implementing singatures of wallet files into an antivirus software. And with simultanious "attack" from different AV providers, all private keys from backup-less users can be lost. How about that?

I know it was paid in BTC. It's just that the big 100k$ number is still more catchy then 150 of BTCs. But in the bitcoin world it should not be so.. could be the representation of reward was 150k mBTC to beat $$ charisma .

This can't be good for chips. Hotspots are forming. Better heat distribution to liquid is needed, by the use of heat sink of some sort.
