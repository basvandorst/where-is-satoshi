Even Donald Trump has bankrupted companies. Just because you have money it doesn't automatically make sense to put in more.

Charlie knowingly acted as a money laundromat for mobsters. Pretty shitty move tbh.
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:38:18
He put his reputation on the line when he vouched for gox, ostensibly to be able to withdraw his own holdings. Even if Karpeles lied to him, he bears full responsibility. This man should not be trusted.
@_date: 2015-12-02 12:01:07
Not sure if that distinction is important from a legal perspective. Coding yourself or hiring someone. 
made a lot of USD by selling and pumping Litecoin. I am not a lawyer but that might be 'dealing in unregulated securities'.

They stop bitcoin adoption by selling an inferior payment solution. What?

Soft forks can easily be reverted if people don't like the changes. A contentious hard work might kill BitCoin. See the difference?

You really want the go there, son?
@_date: 2015-12-11 14:41:37
This entitled attitude needs to stop. The core devs own you nothing unless you are paying them. 
The free market don't need or want big blocks at the moment otherwise somebody would have stepped up and paid for this functionality. So unless you give devs money or develop yourself you should just shut up. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:48:18


This is no longer the case after the release of Bitcoin Unlimited. Reading the other subs it is clear people are not content to wait for consensus.

"Garvin to develop new altcoin and actively subvert Bitcoin in favor of GarvinCoin" would be a more appropriate title.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:38:42
That's not decentralization. It is just one developer circumventing the process and acting unilaterally.

If Bitcoin was going to threaten the existing power structure, as some insane users say, they would have made it illegal. Bitcoin is still gimmicky nerd money for most people. The powers at be recognized rightly how infeasible Bitcoin is. The current wave of regulations is simply an attempt to curb the illegal drug trade on DNMs. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 01:35:40
You are being disingenuous. 
Adding more transactions to a block is always in a rational actors interest as there is no opportunity cost. Unlike in your disingenuous analogy. 
Bitcoin was designed to work in a trust less and decentralized manner. This is the entire purpose of PoW. If you start assuming regulated mining, you lose this theoretical property. Then, why bother with PoW? A centralized authority will work just as well when you have presupposed trust in the miners.
Edit: You don't seem to grasp the concept of rational actor. It does not mean, rational as in common sense reasonable, but has a very specific game theory meaning. Cf. Prisoners dilemma. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:27:13
There's no evidence that larger blocks leads to higher income for miners. In fact, game theory suggests the fees would decrease. How the network will be financed in the future is very unclear at this point.
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:51:48
PoS is arguably just as secure.

There is no way Bitcoin can become a global currency that millions use to buy coffee. A block chain is just to inefficient to deal with that much data.
Bitcoin has found a niche market. Why experiment with the foundations and risk catastrophe?  If it ain't broken don't fix it.

They just have to deal with the card companies

You are missing the point. What people mean when they say Bitcoin XT is an alt, is that the development process has been circumvented.

Pretty weak list to be honest. Also way to long. These kind of material need to focus on what is unique about bitcoin not comparing it to banks. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:13:10
Do I look like I am joking?
@_date: 2015-07-05 01:33:26
Litecoin was created by a schism in the community. Hence it's an alternative coin. It has its own community, devs, design principles etc. The community is what defines a crypto-currency.
If one reads Gavin's original ultimatum at face value, he proposes a similar split of the community. He argues for bypassing the community process. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:31:20
Double standard. Bitcoin white paper contains no such economic analysis.  And I haven't seen any deeper economic analysis of how bitcoin is supposed to work after mining subsidies become irrelevant. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:26:39
This shit is starting to get ridiculous. Something needs to be done quick to fix this or chaos will reign.

Wealthy people invest their money into the economy. They don't hoard dollars or gold; they buy companies and real estate. Bitcoiners on the other hand keep their Bitcoins offline and far away from the economy.

Bitcoin do have high transaction costs financed by the mining subsidy. Arguably Bitcoin also have a centralization problem, considering the oligarchy of the exchanges.

They changed their software license from GPL to a much more restrictive license. A dick move that moves away from the open nature if the bitcoin ecosystem.

I would not recommend Trezor. Look up how to make a offline wallet.

Bitcoin will never be able to deal with that kind of user base. Mass adoption is a pipe dream. Best we can hope for is a niche market share like today.
