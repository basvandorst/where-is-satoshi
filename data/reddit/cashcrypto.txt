Was just trying that out thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:42:35
They really do :(
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:59:44
Hi. Because of chargebacks.
@_date: 2014-10-31 12:28:10
Good job!
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:45:56
Holy shit you committed fraud ?


@_date: 2013-11-15 20:08:11


Nobody is receiving coins ( accept Bitpay) ? You are talking about someone buying Bitcoins with paypal. We don't sell Bitcoins you understand this right? I appreciate the feedback but you seem to not understand what we are doing.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:08:40
I'm just doing the hypothetical for his "other" stash. But the fed does have like 160,000 coins I think?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:13:24
You bring up a good point. Under-cut the price and make available cheap coins to hundreds of thousands of peeps who snatch them up. Tomorrow we do find out.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:02:14
If you need to get out my service can do Bitcoins to Paypal [Cashcrypto.com]( Let me know if you have any questions.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:30:25
Hi,  we wouldn't chargeback and you wouldn't chargeback on cash you receive if this is what you mean by chargebacks ?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:06:53
Interesting take. But what institutional buyer would risk be associated with those holdings?
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:23:07
Welcome to the future! :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:39:23
Will be on c-span!
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:30:47
If you have problems we just opened up [CashCrypto.com]( - which would enable you to sell Bitcoins to your Paypal account (others coming soon ). 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:07:12
I'm game. Let me know what is involved.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:34:50
New partnership and new business model.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:47:14
Thanks, likewise!
I know, I know I'm more about customer service and getting the functionality down then design but I hear you! and will work on the layout. Thanks for the feedback! talk soon. ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:03:27
I hear what you are saying. But this isn't a hacked PayPal account. The goal is to provide a easy and safe way of exiting out of Bitcoins without all the hassles. But your point remains correct.
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:58:06
With [CashCrypto]( Assuming Paypal is still around or any cash based service who receives cash for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:11:44
Honestly, I know more about economics and money since I've ran into Bitcoin. It has totally changed my outlook.
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:52:00
Thanks! If you to use it I'll waive the fee so you can vouche for it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:02:33
I HOPE!!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:42:51
Boom! you nailed it!
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:14:10


Huh? The service is for people to get cash for Bitcoins.  How would they get screwed over? I already explained there would be no reason for the person receiving cash to do a charge back, there would no reason for us to do a chargeback and there would no reason for Paypal to reverse anything. How is this screwing someone over? Keep in mind, I fully understand peoples hate for Paypal but we basically have minimal involvement with Paypal and some people still wouldn't mind receiving cash to their Paypal account regardless.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:38:18
Thanks. Yes, I've seen them also and report them also . I know the website isn't the most glamorous  of sites but it really isn't about the site , it's about delivering the service being advertised and providing good customer service in my opinion. I've tried that with my previous Bitcoin business as mentioned above. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:56:05
amen! amen!
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:26:55
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:19:51
My company btcinstant.com will be opening a way for people to buy small amounts of Bitcoin shortly.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:27:32
They end up in your coinbase account. You would send them to MultiBit.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:30:21
Will add the exchange rate for sure. Right now it is whatever BitPay uses which I believe is BitStamp.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:46:20
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:59:55
If you need to exit out to USD I can do it to paypal -&gt; via the new service I opened up   Let me know how I can help!
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:12:36
I like what I'm hearing good job!
**edit**: I'm a junky for Bitcoin news I have issues.
**edit 2**: this your donation address 164wexrxz8Y72tvAfZw1QKekJDACL1GmH1 ?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:29:01
True, I suppose if its 144,000 that is a heavy day's trading volumn.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:39:06
At least I kept it simple , yes? ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:44:50
There would be no reason for the person receiving their cash to do a chargeback. And there would be no reason for us to do a chargeback. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:47:56
Why would paypal do a chargeback? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:14:19
XBT is some new term people are switching 2  but I forget what it means also.  To buy Bitcoin it seems to be fine. Problem is getting USD in they only use OKpay and like one other....moneygram or something.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:45:18
Thank you sir!  any questions or suggestions just hit me up on here or :
contact 
Have a good Friday!
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:10:59
I don't think so. Here is discussion we are having now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:09:07
Just was on them today playing about. It isn't to bad. What is that you want to do ?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:02:06
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:07:22
I opened a new service yesterday called [CashCrypto]( that will give your cash to your PayPal account. In order to get some trust and feedback to the community I can waive any fee. Just PM me if you have questions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:04:32
I see either help people get exit out of Bitcoin with    or invest in a Bitcoin Crowdfunding site like say  .
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:27:55
Very promising!
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:32:49
I didn't expect this to be easy to gain community trust as I can see by the downvotes!  ;-).
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:22:45
I just opened up a service yesterday that can be your exit out to PayPal ( other services soon ) if you want to get out that way. It is [CashCrypto.com]( Let me know if you have any questions and can waive fee to get some community recognition if need be.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:38:34
$400 shortly.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:21:56
Check out [BitcoinStarter.com](  crowdfunding for Bitcoin as you mentioned.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:07:39
Ah yes I know this my friend. Thing is Paypal has no idea if I own a Garden Business or a Bitcoin Business. We are just passing cash on to people. The cards we use are attached to non-Bitcoin related businesses so there is noway/ or reason to do what you are mentioning.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:14:41
Ah nah. I mean the coins (tainted)  are associated with DPR. Not sure some big time investor will snatch those up based on this.
