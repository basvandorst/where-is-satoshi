Banks and stock exchanges are more established and probably have insurance of some type. Crypto is fairly new so you are more likely to get screwed by an exchange until it all gets more regulated. Your choice though

Nobody gives a damn about bitcoin except you know
Peter Thiel - Billionaire who co-founded Paypal and early investor in Facebook
Tim Draper - Billionaire and highly successful venture capitalist early investor in Hotmail, Skype + Tesla
Winklevoss Twins - Co founders of Facebook 
Jack Dorsey - Billionaire Co founder + CEO of Twitter
I'll take the word of these people who have a track record of making ridiculous amounts of money being able to see the future of technology over you thanks.

You are more than welcome to your opinion and nobody knows what will happen going forward but the fact is there is still only a very small fraction of the population aware of crypto and a lot more regulation needed i.e. ETF before the masses get involved.

I don't know how many they have but a simple google shows they believe in it and regularly voice their support. 
Yes at the moment the supply far outweighs the demand but the fact is the majority of people still don't understand crypto and until it becomes more mainstream and better understood/regulated it will carry on this way. Nobody is saying it should be a million a coin or even 100k a coin now, those predictions are for years down the line when more people get involved and the supply becomes more scarce.

Sounds like FB Libra coin and bitcoin are not competing against each other.
 As I understand it Libra is going to be more like a stablecoin to act more like Fiat so no need to worry about wild price fluctuations. Bitcoin was never going to take over from Fiat, it just isn't realistic given it's scarcity and how slow it is to transfer. Bitcoins best bet is as a store of value i.e digital gold. 
With this in mind no reason they can't coexist. Could even be argued that it would bring more people into the cryptosphere who werent before

For me it's the store of value option too. Why can't it become the digital version of gold? You have plenty of people who invest in gold without physically using or seeing it
