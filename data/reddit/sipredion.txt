Fair enough, banks offer security and a few fun perks, but don't forget the housing market crash in '08 was the banks, and since then they've just gotten better at hiding the shady shit they pull.
Beyond that you have the problem with the reserve banks. The federal reserve Bank in America (for example) is privately owned (which is one of the bigger pieces of bullshit the general population ignores), and typically just prints more money whenever the government needs more (which I think even a child could tell you is terrible economic practice and _absolutely_ will not end well in the long run)

Competition is one thing, when the shit talking and shady shit starts happening it becomes underhanded. It's becomes aggressive and it loses any of the positive impact it could have had

Looks good, too many bugs. I use visual studio code for work and it holds up really up.

This is true. Learning PHP rn and I wrote a WordPress plugin to do some stuff. It works, but it looks like a god damn war zone. I'm gonna save it as is and come back to in a few months so I can laugh at myself.

Did you dodge the bullet too?
For real though: yeah he does make some valid points, but that sentence immediately tells me that he isn't invested in what's going on, which means he's not trying to be helpful.  Just boasting about how he "dodged the bullet".
