Dogecoin still has low TX fees and high speed.  Can even buy stuff with it
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:58:00
Welp. That was full-on retarded.

lets not forget that to use bitcoin, u need internet.  no internet, no crypto currency.  that's the major drawback. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:07:32
You can certainly buy a plush pussy cat doll tho

It may not be legit, but people will use it. Isn't that what silk road was about?
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:03:40
True. Advertising is probably why most credit cards don't charge annual fees anymore
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:06:23
Or Dogeparty

I'm Baby Farks McGeezacks,  what about my Space Cash?
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:17:19
No, but I'd 3d print one. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 02:05:11
Wow. If that's true, we're going to experience deflation. That's scary.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:45:33
Does anybody actually believe bitcoin is an investment?  Serious question bc there is no info of where the price is going.
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:14:22
Yeah. Totally took my mind completely off the article's subject. Most insane "or" I've ever seen.

Is Wayne BTC gonna have to chokeabitch?

I agree that the regulations suck, but it's the law of the land. If Uber doesn't have to follow the rules, why does everyone else?  Taxi companies were all built around and play by the same rules.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:13:28
Taxi cartel?  You mean companies that HAVE to follow decades of state regulation while Uber somehow circumvents the system?
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:41:43
I understand that over regulation is terrible, but why keep using the term cartel?  What is your definition of cartel?  I thought you were using the term loosely and find it hard to compare taxi industry to drug cartel.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:08:16
Besides bitcoin, the only other legit crypto is Doge
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:43:11
Serious observation: I honestly think that this is how fascism works.  Reduce chaotic markets by government only allowing one or a few entities to control markets.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:32:32
Or your mom.  Teehehehehe
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:59:47
I wonder if cybersquattingbtc.com is available. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:42:16
Is doge taking over?
