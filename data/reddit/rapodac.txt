What prevents a bad guy from forging email requests?

You've got my attention at least. What's the hardest part in getting this to work well?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:33:39
I really like this idea. Better ways to get Bitcoin into the hands of first-time users are needed. This looks like a fun way to do it.
My main question at this point is: how do you make money at something like this?
BTW, cute video with a catchy tune.

An alternative cryptocurrency with explicit backing by a large government.

At some point, you'll be able to buy into a [bitcoin ETF](

Well, for a time, you could actually [buy physical bitcoins]( That may have contributed to the confusion.
A bitcoin is an entry in a global, distributed ledger system controlled by mathematics and implemented in software running on thousands of computers simultaneously.
An address/private key pair gives you permission to use this ledger system to move bitcoins to any other address.
Fiat systems like the dollar require forgery protection in the form of an object that is hard to make (physical coin or bill), or trusted third parties like banks.
Bitcoin needs none of this. Whoever knows a private key can move some or all of the coin the ledger says the corresponding public key contains.
No wonder theres's so much misinformation and confusion - bitcoin is like nothing the world has seen before.

Who are you - do you have a website?
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:44:36
Ah, I missed the first link - it looks like this is actually your plan, but that you're releasing the current version as open source. Correct?
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:42:57
Interesting idea - I see how it would solve a real problem.
Why not set up a Web app that does this for people, so they don't have to run a server at home (something I think few will be willing/able to do)?

Selling video conferencing services might make some money, but selling pre-made videos on a pay-per-view basis could scale far better.
You could test the idea that significant numbers of people would be willing to pay for this. One way to get started could be to make one or two good videos and put them up on a service like [Open Sesame](
You could also test the idea in online forums where people with the   conditions you help with gather.
In other words, I'd work on validating the business idea first, then add Bitcoin once you're sure you have something that will sell.

[Download bitaddress]( onto a USB drive. Insert this drive onto a computer that has never been connected to the Internet, and load the file using any Web browser. Generate your addresses from there.


Yes, give them the wallet you print from the bitaddress file. This piece of paper contains both the public address and private key for withdrawing funds. At this point they're trusting you not to abuse your knowledge of their private key. But you won't be managing anything for them other than the initial transaction.
Your clients can easily check the balance online (little security risk) by typing the public address into blockchain.info. For example, [this is an address with lots of transactions](


These are people for whom bitcoin is not a good idea. If you think a person has a good chance of losing the private key to their address, then they probably will. At that point, the coins are lost forever.
You might encourage them to put the paper wallet into a safety deposit box, and bookmark the link to their public address in their browser if they feel like checking on it.

That makes sense.
What would you estimate your current costs to be today based on your hardware configuration? What percentage of that is due to electricity vs. hardware?

Keep your eye on the long-term trend.

Try selling BTC at the booth. It's still quite difficult for most people to buy, but many have heard of it. Showing exactly how it works is the best way to teach anyway.
$100 isn't a lot of money and will teach you a lot about how willing people are to accept the idea. You may even end up with a new side-business!
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:45:00
Great idea. Just curious, though - why do you quote prices in USD? Why not quote them in BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:48:52
The irony - it burns!

This could be really useful, especially if it told merchants exactly what they need to do to make/buy a POS system and a wallet.
For those who want to make these guides, remember that the average merchant is [slaving away 12 hours in their store]( not reading Reddit.
I found these, but IMO they don't explain *exactly* how you set yourself up to take Bitcoin in person.

1) Buy on [coinbase](
2) Create one [paper wallet]( for each of your customers.
3) Transfer an equal quantity of bitcoin into each paper wallet you generated.
4) Give the paper wallet to your client.

I'm still not sure exactly when this was published. The  post is dated: "SATURDAY, DECEMBER 27, 2008".
But in a [later post]( the author (Nick Szabo) uses the anchor text "2005" to refer to his bit gold article:


Also, a recent post claiming that [Szabo is in fact Satoshi Nakamoto]( refers the to 2005 as being the year the bit gold idea was first written up.
Is there any other evidence supporting the idea that Szabo published this post in 2005?

Ask yourself how the computer industry has managed to not just survive, but thrive through 30 years of non-stop deflation.
The [Satoshi paper]( only mentions a fixed stock of currency tangentially:


If you like inflation, [Peercoin]( has a built-in rate of 1%. The only problem is - how can anybody know that 1% is the right value?
On the other hand, given a public ledger and full knowledge of all transactions, it might be possible to develop a cryptocurrency that optimizes the inflation rate over time. I just can't see anybody agreeing on how exactly to do this.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:35:55
Agree. The article raises some valid points about sustainability.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:48:41
You may have already done it, but (re)reading [Satoshi's paper]( is well worth the effort.
Also, read anything by [Nick Szabo](

Glad to hear. What was the hardest part in doing this?

Gyfter apparently allows you to buy [Wallmart Gift cards using bitcoin]( Fees might be something to be careful of, though.
If you're lucky to live near a [bitcoin ATM]( that's also an option.

The more I see the term 'bubble' being bandied about, the more I suspect it's not a bubble.
I could find almost nobody during 1999 who thought the stock market was in a bubble. Ditto 2007 with real estate.
That's what a bubble looks like.
