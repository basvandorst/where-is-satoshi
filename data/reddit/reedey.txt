Are people legit using this on main net? Is the software even tested?
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:47:49
Then why is Roger Ver acting like this is a good thing?
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:46:15
Why can’t you just withdraw BCH and shapeshift it? Why can’t you just sell for USD and trade for BTC? I get that this is inappropriate behaviour, but you’re acting as if they are blocking you from doing something that is very easy to work around. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:24:14
Still a long way to go tho. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:05:29
Why does Windows Defender think 3.0.5 is unsafe to run? I have never had that happen with any version of Electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:32:54
Are there any limitations to using segwit? For example can bitcoin be sent freely between segwit and non segwit wallets? Or once it’s been sent to a segwit wallet, is it confined to segwit only wallets? I just want to fully understand if there any any downsides to this. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:18:44
I moved my BTC to a segwit wallet this week and transaction fees seem to be practically the same. And yes this is when sending to another segwit address. What am I missing here?

Write down your seed next time. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:32:32
When I bought my BTC the AUD was at parity with the USD. Bitcoin has been a great hedge against a falling Aussie dollar. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:21:22
Please name him Lambo.

“Some of them even have a working website!”
I lost it at that bit. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:56:05
Roger Ver lost all credibility the day he claimed that Mt Gox wasn’t insolvent. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:22:47
Yea I'm inclined to agree. That's why I sold 99% of my BCH. But I was expecting a fart in the wind and it's shown at least a little bit of staying power. Much more than I expected anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:31:14
Whats the latest Hard Fork? Is there more than just BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:38:09
Yes, but as long as the market doesn't seem to care then a few peoples opinions don't really seem to matter. Again, just because we think the fee sucks doesn't mean everyone does. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:20:32
When are you people going to understand that this kind of thing gets priced into the market the moment it becomes known, not the moment it actually happens.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:38:05
Shapeshift is proving frustrating..... Keeps rejecting my trade requests....
@_date: 2019-03-06 09:10:20
I didn’t think LN payments were tracked? How do they know what the transaction volume is. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:49:13
I bought $6 worth of games on Steam this week.
The network fee took the total up to about $11.
When I bought bitcoin, it was $125 per coin. 
This means I paid a real world equivalent of roughly 35 cents for this content, including network fee.
The network fee will be set by whatever people are willing to pay for it, just because you are not willing to pay it doesn't mean others aren't. And as long as record prices continue to fall, these kinds of complaints won't really be heard. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:38:06
Almost definitely won't be able to recover it. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:50:11
Well my main thought is if vanilla BTC is actively implementing measures that address the very reason the BCH's existence, then BCH to me seems like just another pointless alt coin. Also forseeable that as soon as BTC purists start to catch on that they can trade BCH back into BTC that getting ahead of that inevitable flood of people would at least give you a chance to short the market.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:03:09
Does this mean it's time to get rid of our BCH now?
@_date: 2019-10-02 08:03:53
I remember him giving financial advice not that long ago where he suggested people invest a very small amount in crypto, maybe he was just speculating rather than trumpeting the merits of the technology.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:14:10
Well the BCH price is holding quite steady at the moment so I don't think we will see a death spiral, it will just settle in at a level comparable to all of the other dime a dozen alt coins.
I say this as a guy who has converted almost all his BCH into BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:12:15
A correct depiction would show the trader ending up exactly where he started at best.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:41:44
It's over $10k AUD, if that counts?
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:08:23
I would be mad about this if 100% of google ads weren't pedalling scams.
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:47:10
So you lose your BCH if you send it to a BTC address, but what happens if you send your BTC to a BCH address? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:18:14
As a BTC absolutist, this statement has absolutely no merit. Blockchain technology has bitcoin to thank for its existence yes, but it does not owe bitcoin anything. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:02:38
Do you know anything about the content of his course? For all we know it might actually be informative. Just because people are paying money to learn what they can find online doesn’t mean they’re getting scammed. They’re just paying to hear it from a “trusted” source. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:49:25
People say a lot of things. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:04:20
Is there a decent iOS wallet with segwit yet? I’ve been using bread for ages so don’t particularly want to change. But no segwit combined with poor stability has me looking. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:37:57
This still doesn’t answer my question. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:49:34
I thought I was the only one who saw nothing of value whatsoever in this article. Wanna be best friends?
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:55:56
Would have been funnier if he said "Patience Yong man"
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:48:25
Am I the only one who thinks this article is absolute shit?
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:15:18
Yea I thought the same thing. Until I found out that DPR actually tried to facilitate murders to protect his own ass. 
Look into the actual facts guys. The guy tried to get people killed. That's why he was convicted under kingpin laws. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 11:48:44
Any way of knowing how much they paid for these blocks? Very interested to see how it compares to the current market rate.
@_date: 2018-04-18 07:47:16
I love the idea but i've been a hodler since 2013 and i've moved my BTC between about 4 different wallets in that time so I'm not sure this actually tells us anything.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:09:49
Incoming shitcoin announcement!
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:47:03
Yea everything I am seeing points to this being the case but while you have BTC that have gone missing and are still unaccounted for.... You can't help but worry. Especially given how much they're worth right now &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:07:52
I thought the very nature of BTC was such that they wouldn't have cold storage as such, and all coins were uniquely allocated to accounts.
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:46:11
Yea this withdrawal was basically my final act of "Get the fk out of Mt Gox" so theyre not making it easy for me haha!
