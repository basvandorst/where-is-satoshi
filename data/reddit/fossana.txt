This is a simplistic version of it, but basically you have nodes and you have accounts/addresses. Accounts are individual blockchains, where each account only stores transactions involving itself in its own blockchain. These blockchains are similar to Bitcoin's, except each block only consists of one transaction (which makes me wonder if they should really be called blocks in the first place).
The nodes keep track of all of the individual blockchains, and every time a new transaction is broadcasted, nodes check if their is conflict (trying to spend the same input twice mostly). If there is a conflict, nodes will tell other nodes to start a vote, and they vote on which transaction is valid (if there is a conflict there are two transactions that are opposed to each other, and only one can be considered valid). Voting is weighted by the amount of RaiBlocks each node represents (the amount of RaiBlocks the node's account contains + the amount of RaiBlocks owned by the accounts that have chosen that node as a representative). The voting process is completed in seconds I believe.

I know that in Raiblocks each individual account has its own blockchain, but I think this is inaccurate term since transactions aren't grouped together like in Bitcoin. Is a block consisting of only one transaction really a block? A block is not synonymous with a single transaction, and in RaiBlock's case each "block" is just a transaction + a hash referencing the previous transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:01:05
Yeah. I just mean the actual technology of course.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:05:00
Raiblocks is so fundamentally different. There are no blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:30:43
Yeah but it's in everyone's best self-interest to sell if everyone is going to panic sell, since you sell near the top and then you can buy back in after the crash.

Every bubble has that same pattern up until it pops.
Things are fundamentally different this time. There's wall street money. There's coinbase fuckery. There's the gigantic growth this year. There's the growing concern over high fees and slow confirmation times. The public may have already poured what money it will into bitcoin due to bitcoin reaching the general public through mainstream news.

If it did contain three words would it be stuff like "my" "to" "in". More like connecting words. so it would be "myethereumwallet" rather than "pizzaethereumwallet".

Can u also give me a list of literally every brand name, game names, place, etc that might show up?

The professionals probably have better methods for generating passwords to test. Professionals aren't a threat to every password-protected wallet. They needs hints about the password like OP is giving out and they would need the partial encrypted master private key that OP gave out too. If you have a wallet just don't give these things out normally.

That's good to hear! I guess my main point was that just because it recovered before doesn't mean that it will again so soon. Personally I'm invested in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin.

We've all made our bets at this point :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:30:38
So it won't be something like "myelectrumwallet"? Will it have two characters or one character at the emd potentially?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:38:45
So the characters wouldn't be completely random?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:47:27
do you throw in random letters, or will it only consist of actual words?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:37:09

If it's always legit words with possibly two random characters at the end there's faster ways to search. Just need like brand names and stuff

If you think about it we all only believe in the laws of motion because we have observed them in action a gajillion times and have not seen something that would suggest otherwise. What we think are absolute truths about the universe are nothing other than potentially coincidental patterns that have never been broken.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:19:21
Would you ever do 1 random letter at the end, or just two? got any other brand or words you would use? like names of people or pets, names of places, favorite games, all the brands you can think of, etc.
I'm attempting to generate every combination of two word passwords and three word passwords using the 10,000 most commonly used words + crypto currency terms + any stuff you have mentioned + stuff I think you could randomly throw in there.

You aren't spending bitcoin now because you bought it as an investment. If bitcoin is globally adopted then you won't perceive its value to rise as much as you do now. Maybe you'll get 2% a year due to deflation. But you spend your fiat now despite being able to get 7% after inflation from index funds. And if bitcoin was the only currency, it's not like you wouldn't buy things. People buy things at the time they do because they wanted them at that time and not later.

Sure there is. A blockchain is just a chain of blocks. A block at a minimum only needs to contain the following:
1. Data.
2. A valid hash.
3. A reference to the valid hash of the previous block.
You can validate the blockchain by checking the hash and reference of every block.
You can validate the data in each block by making sure that each "transaction" is associated with one or more public keys, and that all of those public keys have signed the transaction using their private keys.
Without a token there isn't an incentive to mine, which is a problem, so that's the only point at which I think having a token makes sense.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:27:20
You'd be better off using something other than Bitcoin to do that. You can use blockchain technology, but if you use Bitcoin, you have to embed the messages in transactions, and transactions have a lot of overhead, so you end up paying way more fees for the transaction details than the message itself. A blockchain designed for uploading data would be more suitable.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:26:44
You could write an ethereum smart contract that lets you upload messages to the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:27:08
You could have a blockchain that is just a board for posting personal quotes.
Lets say A is a public address, and A wants to post a message that says: "I like peanut butter. -A." To make sure this really came from A, we just require that A sign the message with his/her private key, and then attach that signature to the message.
Transactions in Bitcoin are validated because the signatures match the public addresses and message. The message that is being signed and validated doesn't have to say "send" or "transfer" in it anywhere.

Because they won't let you withdraw it until you have played a lot. For poker sites, usually the amount you have to play causes you to pay rake equal to the bonus, so basically the bonus is letting you play rake free for a while, which is actually a very good thing if you're any good at poker.

You can't get the private key, but since GDAX owns that address presumably, you can contact support and ask them to credit the bitcoin you sent to that address mistakenly.

If you think buying 2 hours ago is stupid, then not selling 2 hours ago is equally stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:28:46
So we're assuming it's an address that has never sent any BTC? Otherwise you would use one of the transaction signatures to derive the public key and work from there.

I think governments will issue fiat backed crypto currencies.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:01:38
You don't have to have a shared key to decrypt. You can continue to use ECDSA like Bitcoin and have asymmetric encryption.
Instead of email it would be more like a twitter where nobody can retract what they wrote and where twitter can't rewrite what people said.

That's not really the point. Swap the government in this situation with Mr. Smith and the post would be about Mr. Smith's mistake instead and I'd make a similar comment.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:13:20
No because people can stop mining, so the floor is 0. But as long as people are mining, they're essentially buying bitcoin with cash, the only difference is that they use that cash to buy electricity and hardware first.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:59:16
The fact that each block needs a valid hash and a valid reference is what makes the blockchain secure, not the data itself.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:00:37
Please explain how transactions make the blockchain more secure, outside of mining.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:36:43
The security and immutability of the bitcoin blockchain has nothing to do with the transactions, except for the fact that the hash of each block needs to be what you get when you hash all of the transactions in that block.

Nothing you can do. Wipe your hard drive clean and reinstall your OS. Be more cautious in the future (hardware wallet, paper wallet, or airgapped laptop).

Either way you have around $1000 worth of stuff. Why would the price you originally paid matter?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:51:27
Having 1 BTC and selling it for $1000 is the same as having $1000 and not buying a bitcoin. In other words, the government's decision to sell 144,336 BTC is equally stupid as them not having had the 144,336 BTC in the first place but not choosing to buy 144,336 with whatever funds they had at that time. And yet we think they're acting rationally in the latter case but stupidly in the former.
Hindsight is 20/20.

You can have a blockchain without a value token if you don't care about decentralization.
The value token contributes to decentralization because there is an incentive for people to mine and thus the ability to add new blocks becomes distributed.
The value token also adds to the immutability of blocks already added, because the immutability scales with the difficulty of finding valid hashes, and the difficulty of finding valid hashes only goes up if it scales with the amount of CPU power devoted to mining, and the only decent way to incentive mining is by rewarding miners with newly minted tokens which are used to pay for data being added to the blockchain.

If someone is willing to spend $1000 on electricy/hardware degradation to mine 0.1 BTC, then that person is willing to buy bitcoin at $6000 per coin.

The whole point of a blockchain is having a distributed database that is verifiable and practically immutable.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:03:40
What makes you think anything needs to be transferred back and forth in the first place? A blockchain is just a place to upload signed data. That data can be payments, but it doesn't have to be.

Yeah I meant a trapdoor function. I actually originally had trapdoor function in the article but took it out later. There are multiple private keys for the same address though.
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:32:37
Yeah, there were probably some reasons Satoshi chose secp256k1. Satoshi said that he chose secp256k1 for no reason, but he might've had his reasons.
Perhaps it would be better to say that you can't derive the private key from the public key, it's a one way function, and thus you have to brute force it.
I'll consider these changes along with some others when I have time.
Thanks for the feedback.
