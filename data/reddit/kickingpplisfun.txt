I don't mean to sound cynical, but I don't think it's an "infiltration"- they might not have been as obvious, but greedy people have been into bitcoin for at least a few years.  I think the generous people were just outdone recently.  
I now that anecdotes aren't evidence, but all the people I knew IRL who were raving about it were exactly the vultures you're complaining about, whereas I met a lot of cool people online, a few of which who even gave me BTC to help fund an idea that didn't come to fruition(honestly, given my current financial straits, I wish I'd sat on it for a while- it would be enough to pay for both the surgery I've been saving for and to actually implement the idea in question).  And if you're wondering what the project was, it was a metal casting project I thought I only needed about $200 for, but it turned out I needed a furnace due to atmospheric heat losses when using a blowtorch.

Yeah, not that I think that's gonna happen, but I have a consistent track record of buying into dips that I can reasonably see going back up, only to wind up losing quite a bit more money(heck, I even had one stock get outright delisted).

You also can't rub bitcoin on your chest...  Of course, aren't there silver/gold coins with a QR code that links to a wallet containing bitcoins?

Companies like the Perth mint have a huge reputation to uphold.  If even one person discovers that their coin isn't what they thought it was, then everyone will check even more thoroughly and find out that they've been duped.  They will then destroy the company in court for selling counterfeits.
OP got this coin straight from the mint, so there's even more risk in giving out fakes because there was no middle man.

Likewise, you could get a 5 ozt America the Beautiful "quarter" and spend it at face value... not that you can get anything for 25 cents anymore.

Also, he could have gotten a kilo of 1 ozt(or other metric measurements) coins instead.

Well, Apple had about a 1.5% chance, so that makes sense.

Seriously, that's what I believed the GOP was in fucking elementary school- as soon as the Rand exposure stopped(had to read three of her pamphlets in HS) and I got slapped a few times, the facade quickly fell apart.
