Why are you ignoring the hypothetical, if the country shifted ideologically against inflationary currency and mandated that it must only be deflationary would you then be okay with it?

 So if they came out with a deflationary constitutionally backed policy youd be okay with it?

What reason is there to purchase goods with bitcoin if its deflationary?
I own EA $90 calls for example that I bought at $74 and now EA is $92. My calls have gone up an ungodly amount in value, if at any point I sold a single contract to "buy food or living expenses" I would have lost a substantial amount of money. I very well may hit 1500%+ in returns on these calls depending on how earnings go.
Infact it is far more rational to put off spending money if it means holding onto my calls as in the long run I will be able to purchase far more goods.
If an asset is only going to up in value its retarded to sell it, I would literally choose to starve before I sell these EA calls

So they literally can be changed by democratically elected representatives, so the people literally have a say in how the currency is managed
