You seem to be mistaken, as many people in this sub will tell you "Core software" isn't bitcoin it's a reference client.
 
But this is only true up until someone offers different software that's an alternative to the Core reference client. Then suddenly the "Core software" is suddenly bitcoin. LOL the irony is amazing.

Thank you for stating what so many people are unwilling to hear. Most people will stick their fingers in their ears when truth like this is brought to them. Your comment here on Reddit made my day, thanks.

Exactly. The Tweet is false. He was not removed because of this. This is an outright lie. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:34:21
It's funny this excuse is used so often these days. Don't confuse one software client they say. But when others offer another software client like Bitpay, pitchforks come out. 
"Core is only 1 reference client" but if you don't use it in a blog post a small minority of alleged luminaries and the brigade will attack you publicly. 
I mean another reference code was mentioned in a blog post for Christ sakes and people have their undies in a bunch.

Yeah let's applaud Eric Bozo the clown for continuing to threaten people and businesses with violence. Seems like he has a monopoly on stupidity.

LOL. This has nothing to do with advertising. You should really read up on how Google works. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:20:01
Then quit whining, get a miner and compete. That's the point.

Except we've seen no proof. Crickets.

I down voted you because you rely on confirmation bias, the words of others, and ridiculous conspiracy theories. Bitpay is here to stay.

Or maybe the state sponsored event takes place with the technocracy of development and miners have been doing what they've been doing since day 1 and are just there for profits. I run multiple clients and I think that's the least riskiest bet for investors who should be in charge of bitcoin. Miners will follow the money. Designers will be rewarded if they achieve technical advances. The competition is on. I will vote on what works the best and not depend on the bias of the developing elite.

Actually, it solves a lot. People disregarding using Gavin's patch do not understand the code. ETH and ETC didn't have replay protection and everything was fine. Everything else discussed here is just fear mongering. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:27:07
^ THIS. Truth trumps fear mongering. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:15:18
Let's see if Segwit helps us scale. I don't give stripes to no one, not any of the current dev teams. In fact as a bitcoin investor they work for me, I'll put my money into the best protocol that scales. Technicals will trump internet chatter soon. Let's see it happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:48:09
Keep up the good work Jeff. Stay buried in the code and don't listen to the haters. You are doing great. Lots of us support you.

We can pretend that this is why he was removed but this is a lie.

He's a statist. Who cares about this socialist?

This post is ridiculous, meaningless and a divisive tactic. Just because these companies did not sign doesn't mean they don't support the plan.

Where's your citation to the lawsuit? You left the patent link and nothing else in this thread. With no source, you are spreading FUD. Down voted for not providing a citation to your 'claims.'

If you don't like miners you don't understand bitcoin.

Exactly. This post is just as ridiculous as the rest of them. Let the markets decide by observing technical competence. Move on and let's see what happens.

I'd expect us to be smarter than falling for the oldest trick ever played on mankind. Seriously it's not hard to visualize what has happened. I'm sorry if you think I'm naive, I just had to put it out there that these heavily promoted propaganda campaigns from both camps don't represent me and thousands of others. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:44:28
Whether you are invested for self sovereign money or invested for other reasons it's the same thing. Everyone involved in bitcoin is invested to a degree and for many different reasons. That's the beauty of bitcoin. Instead we we've managed to create this illusion of two distinct subsets. Unfortunately that's what agendas do and they are very simple to spark. 
Every single day we hear about two camps and the evils of each side. I just want you all to know there is a third side to this story that unfortunately has to accept the synthesis of both likely contrived adversities. I personally think the third side is far bigger than the two bickering sides. 
I believe the two minority groups of bitcoiners have been victimized by a relatively easy trick that has plagued those fighting for freedom for decades. They have fallen for propaganda, figureheads and luminaries, and are steering bitcoin in the wrong direction. Splitting the chain will do a lot of damage. Maybe we all need to pause. It's perfectly ok for me to say that. That's my 2 cents. Good luck with the synthesis. :/
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:10:56
Good. Screw all the conspiracy theories and run the code. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:34:19
Because that's what a lot the network participants wanted.  Most likely the silent majority too. People wanted both. We can sit here all day and talk about forcing people with UASF or UAHF but the bottom line is Segwit2x is voluntary and a compromise. 
There's a huge difference between 'voluntary' and 'forcing' participation. Unfortunately many humans still don't understand the foundations of 'consent' yet. This is a perfect example. The whole "we forced peoples hand" theory is rubbish. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:50:52
Yep it is. We've broke significant records this year including six exahash per second, $2 billion in daily trade volume, thousands of new users, and merchants, we've achieved so much and now we're gonna tear that all down because a few minority groups of individuals promoted a Hegelian dialectic outcome. 
Agenda &gt; Thesis &gt; Anti-Thesis &gt; Synthesis 
Such a shame.

Thank you for saying this.

Half these comments are just trying to sway you to believe conspiracies. There are a few comments in here that explain objectively and there are a few articles you can read on the subject too. Don't listen to the conspiracy theorists they are quite abundant right now. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:26:54
I've presented no evidence of my claim to saying "most likely" as you fail to understand the words of my own subjective valuation. IMO polling the bitcoin community or network participants which is made up of millions of users who don't use Reddit, Twitter, and Coinbase is just as subjective. We can't obtain a good metric that way. But hey what do I know. 
However it seems to be the case that network participants want Segwit2x, as far as consensus is concerned. Network participants are choosing voluntarily to support NYA. They didn't have to support it, they weren't forced to accept the new protocol. If network participants really wanted UASF or a UAHF then a great majority would have backed these ideas. And done so responsibly without force. But they didn't. And the majority chose to back Segwit2x. This to me is the silent majority finally choosing. Choosing by means of actual consent rather than force. 
As I've been saying for a while now those threatening to split the chain on both sides of this debate are all a small minority of people trying to force the will of something you just can't force. Bitcoin doesn't work like that.
