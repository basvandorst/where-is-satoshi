Are there any advantages as a merchant when using this app over mycelium to receive payments?

Maybe he's referring to the ATMs in the US which require a cell phone number, government ID, a separate photo, and a palm scan due to restrictive laws:

I was wondering the same thing, maybe they'll constantly be short selling Bitcoin to reduce their risk.

Unfortunately i had the same issue with all4btc, for months they ignored my messages on an order of over 2k$. Since then i've been using snapCard and i've received nothing but great service from them.

Mycelium can create read-only addresses for just this purpose. Then you'd only need to input the price in pounds and it will be converted to Bitcoin using the exchange you've chosen and a QR code will be displayed to the user. You could also use the Blockchain Merchant app which is less configurable but has a cleaner UI and creates a new receiving address for each transaction which enchances the buyer's privacy.

The same thing happened to me twice this week and i haven't even logged into that account since 2011. There was nothing left to steal either and i've never used the username anywhere else. The email seemed legit as well and all the links were correct so the only reasonable conclusion to me would be that it's an attempt at price manipulation.

I received a mail and i've never been registered with kickstarter.
