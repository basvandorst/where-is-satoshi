This is shit but is not new.
It has been noted multiple times during the last *xx* months.

**TL;DR** Choosing the right amounts, it could work out well.
From a game theory perspective this is a very interesting problem. Your solution would be a very good initial strategy if you chose to **send first** a small amount of btc: both parties, then,  have icentives to continue "trading". The scammer because he wants to scam you for more coins and you because every transaction leaves you better off.
Let's say you start by sending a^0 coins and she sends back pa^0 , with p&gt;1. You then send a^1, and get pa^1 etc.
If she scams you in round n, you lose what you send in this round (a^n ) but you also have gains from the previous rounds. Your balance is: a^n - (p - 1) Sum(a^0, a^1,... a^(n-1)).
Therefore, a "fair scammer" would accept the following rules:
1. You first send a small amount a^0 (some mBTC)
* (S)he sends back p*a^0
* You send a_i = a_0 * (p-1) * p^(i-1)  *or* ~~what you just recieved~~ your current net gain
* (S)he sends back p*a_i
* Repeat 3-4 until target sum aquired
If she wont reciprocate for any round after the first, you'll both have lost nothing and gained nothing.
An "unfair scammer" could still accept those rules and robe you of your initial transaction (a^0 ) but if this is a very small amount, you could risk it.
On the other hand, if you are sure it's a scam, you should propose a rule (series) that lets the scammer scam you, so as to lure her to continue playing. The game, then, becomes a game of nerves and outguessing each other.
**Edit, example**
for 40% return
You send | You recieve | Net gain
0.2 |  0.28 | 0.08
0.08 | 0.112 | 0.112
0.112 | 0.1568 |  0.1568
0.1568 | 0.21952 | 0.21952
0.21952 | 0.307328 | 0.307328

Nice; let us know how it goes.
Of course, you don't have to be picky about the amounts. The game is fair as long as you return your current earnings at each round.

It is a well known result that in private, blind auctions the dominant strategy is to bid your valuation or to shade it a bit (see eg [here]( and [here]( . 
Any game theoretic analysis here, should aim to guess the highest valuation.

If I tried to make it work for other blockchains, would I have a bad time?

How will you handle the transaction fees? If you do it without fees, won't it take a very long time?
Starting with 0.01btc and for 60% return you'ld have to send the following amounts:
0.0096, 
0.01536, 
0.024576, 
0.0393216, 
0.100663, etc, but it gets better very soon after that. On round 30 you'll have to send ~5000 bitcoins.

Any progress on your issue?
I'm still waiting for my withdrawal since January.
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:44:22
That, and to reply with the right amount.

Same problem for days. Had the epiphany to use a different browser. Worked fine.

The bot has a wallet; the **first table** shows that **wallet**. You can see the balance for each currency (there are some rounding errors but I'll work on that).
You can instruct the bot to **sell or buy anything**. The orders are given in the **third table**. "Do it" means "Do the transaction that corresponds to this row". The first column shows the direction (BTC &amp;rarr; LTC means "convert my BTC to LTC"), the second shows the amount to be converted etc.
If you don't have enough of some currency to place an order, the corresponding row is disabled.
Any orders that are not immediately executed are **pending** and shown in the **second table**. I think there is something wrong with btc-e's API and sometimes you have to refresh the page multiple times to see the pending orders.
At any time that the bot reaches 100.01 LTC or 3.001 BTC a **withdraw button** will appear. You may enter any address you like and withdraw 30LTC or 1BTC. (I'm not sure this is working so if there's any problem send me a screenshot and I'll check the logs).
There is also the option to 'feed' the bot, just in case it runs too low on cash:
BTC: 1MKwMNuZxtXYWRdzfyiAZfs7GCiufWG9JE, 
LTC:  LYYvHnr8rcgYUePQb3p8R59ZEVWK57k5LX
(What is send there is for the bot *only*)
**TL;DR** Just play with it.

Nobody's funds are held hostage here.
It's a public bot for playing. It's free to use and the initial capital comes from me.
**edit** I suppose there is a missunderstanding here. **You are not supposed to put money in this bot**. It is there just for playing.
The withdraw function is there *just in case* the collective playing makes a profit.
The 'feeding' function is there *just in case* the collective playing makes a huge loss.
Other than that, you just play with it and never pay a dime. It's for fun and for getting used to trading.
