When I go to a fast food joint like KFC or burger king I pay at the counter before I get my food. 
When I eat in a *proper* restaurant I pay after I eat. But KFC isn't one of those establishments. At least not everywhere. 


If the while food industry would assume everyone's a thief you wouldn't be able to sit outside anywhere before paying. But it's tough to pay after eating if you order food to go which in my experience is the majority of business that places like KFC get.

Serious question:
How is it practical for anyone to pay for fastfood with btc considering the fees and time required to confirm a transaction?
I could see it work in restaurants where you spend over $100 for the evening and sit around a bit anyway after paying, having a coffee or whatever.
But paying possibly more in fees than your food cost and waiting in line or even the drive through until your transaction is completed seems ridiculous.

I don't care if it does this year. It probably will at some point. That's why we hodl. I just hope I can buy out some dips before that.
Articles like these will keep popping up, just try to ignore them or just read them for amusement. No need or purpose in getting upset over them

Do you guys have any policy about spending your crypto?
Like, how much of your portfolio you allow yourself to spend and if you buy new btc if you spend any. Do you wait for a high? Any rules or habits you have when it comes to spending

That's really little work and mess for $15000
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:43:33
Huh, any way to find out of the coins are tainted?
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:16:06
It would be super interesting how many of the total amount of coinbase accounts never bought, received, sent or did anything.
I do think the number would be much much lower if sign-up wasn't free. 
Same with YouTube but that's another topic.
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:00:34
I think I can enter the fee amount on the old wallet on which the suspicious coins are
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:42:44
Well, last time I emptied that wallet to coinbase I paid 0.002BTC in fees
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:44:44
That's harsh... My break even point is $3883
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:21:46


Not that I know of.
Yeah thanks for those things to think about, I'll figure something out
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:13:01
I need to send the coin from greenadress to coinbase though. I'd have to check what the fees would be
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:54:35
So I should just transfer the money and I'll be fine?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:19:19
So... You're getting people to send you money so that you can make *more* people send you money?

Hey it's me ur brother...
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:19:45
Honestly just speculation. But look at how it's been developing so far. Exponential growth, doubled in value in about the last year. By this rate it *should* hit 10k within the next 2 or 3 years. But I don't nearly know enough about finance and all that jazz. That's just my opinion right now. I just buy whenever I can however much I can spare and just hope it'll go up over time
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:31:55
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:03:01
1) don't go all in. Only invest what you can afford to lose! 
2) it's likely not necessarily to wait for any bubble to burst or for the price to dip. Even if you buy at a current high (4500 or whatever) you'll be good because it looks like it's going above 10k at some point. You just gotta hodl and be patient
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:44:54
Currently using kraken. Do you know if kraken has any drawbacks compared to coinbase? Or how the fees compare for buying small amounts
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:50:42
Well, this doesn't happen about every two years, so yeah, understandable.
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:00:29
I don't think you can. Those things are heavy (battery and electronics) and most tricks involve getting the board off the ground. You can do a Hippie Jump, *maybe* a Shove It.
Disclaimer: I'm not a skater and my knowledge about all boards is second hand.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:28:07
No fee? For what? Just withdrawal or everything? How do they make money?
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:06:23
Nah I was really not sure
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:20:28
Yeah, the thing is a fee should be fixed imo. Like 4ct fixed or 50ct fixed or whatever. But with the course right now the fee doubled from $2 to $4 in a month, which is frustrating
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:05:55
Good thing I just bought some then, thanks for the info :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:23:50
I think people (me at least) would be more likely to actually fund a Kickstarter or whatever for pure *buy bitcoin* stickers
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:55:14
This is what I'm really interested in. In theory nothing major should happen, right?
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:56:27
I know what you mean. I bought 0.104BTC in April 2016 and I spent 0.09 of that for a VPN which cost 40 bucks. Those 40 bucks would be 360 today
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:42:14
This has taken far longer than anticipated
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:26:41
Ok this makes the background of it clearer. I'm still it sure what that means for the btc in my wallet. From what I've read it basically doesn't change but the price will probably dip a bit and when I buy bitcoin for $100 It'll get split in two currencies?
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:12:31
Hey it's me, your congressman. 
Unfortunately I couldn't receive your donation. Please send it again. Pm me for wallet adress

Came here to say this. Anything more would just sound like overly optimistic guesswork
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:51:16
At this point it's kinda stupid to sell when it's high and buy when it's low. 
Just hold and buy when it dips temporarily
Edit: my opinion, please tell me if I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:58:29
From what I understood right now it's propaby happening but could potentially be fought or stopped. But I'm still ready unclear about all this segwit and segwit2x stuff tbh so take this with a grain of salt. I'm not even sure what consequences segwit2x would have for me

@_date: 2017-08-11 22:48:36
Yeah, true. Hadn't really thought about daytrading with bitcoins. I usually only check in every couple of hours or sometimes just once a day so that would be incredibly stressful. Holders for life :)

That pretty much nails it. Plus right now I'm at 75% gains. If I invest $500 now that goes down significantly.

RemindMe! 3 years "$500k or auto-fellatio"

Not just cool for UK holders. EUR is low. USD is even lower, having GBP hit a milestone like that feels awesome even when I pay in EUR
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:43:01
I can kinda relate. Last I bought was at 7500 I think. Now if I buy $100 worth I feel stupid cause I pay double compared to a few months back.
I guess this is common and normal but it still makes me hesitant to buy atm
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:40:05
I agree that this is bragging. Not too humble too. BUT (while I'm usually super salty about people showing off their cars or whatever) I think here (on this sub in this context) it's actually pretty motivational. Like showing me why I hodl, yknow? Just my two cents
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:00:40
I know we all need to hodl and sit this out but it's so fucking depressing only seeing red numbers for weeks without end

I had to stop reading at *$50k/BTC* and go jerk off

Even if that happened btc would have 9 years to recover

Why though? It's not really different from any vending machine, is it?
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:46:35
Dammit. I think I might have missed something during the bcash fork. Should I have done something around that time?

Don't believe i have any.
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:36:42
Well shit. I just realized I misread your original comment. Sorry, I think 4k in GBP might be a while... Unless GBP crashes
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:40:20
don't think about it too much though

I'd love to be on 100% self sufficiency one day. Can I ask how much you paid in total and how much more you generate than what you use? I imagine you'd need to generate about 200% each sun-hour of what you use in an average hour due to nights and cloudy stretches? How do you store it?
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:38:19
Is this crap the reason for the dip?
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:45:54
Lucky you
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:16:24
That sounds oddly good. Does that mean my wallets worth basically doubles? Also how do I split?
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:47:26


@_date: 2017-10-12 17:01:19
Is there a sub for speculating on how bitcoin evolves? I'd be super interested in what people think. Personally I guess at this rate we'll hit 10k around January but that's just a layman looking at a graph
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:49:28


You sure about that, mate?

Should I be concerned about this using GreenAddeess?

I guess if you're doing it to get the laptop hot it's fine
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:15:02
Yes, pretty much. Do you manually transfer your Netflix subscriptions or other regular stuff? No. Would it be hard for you to do it on your own? No. It's about efficiency and ease of use. And I'm paying for it by paying my bank and coinbase
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:54:36
I'm sure there's some way to automate that, right? Especially with a fixed salary I imagine it can't be hard to automate buying a fixed amount on each payday?
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:13:04
Oh, so you think once crypto atms get more popular it will go down in order to be more appealing than a competitor?
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:27:39
That's actually an interesting thought. Hadn't crossed my mind
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:03:10
That's why I said automate it on my end. My employer isn't involved if I create an automatic buy from my bank account to coinbase
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:56:26
Pretty expensive. Around 400€ more than on coinbase, which is almost 500$. Is that a normal rate for btc atms?

And btw it's totally possible your dad had a 95 machine running when btc started. My dad still has an XP machine.
@_date: 2019-05-20 10:29:16
No fees? How does that work?
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:44:35
Huh ok, not bad. Even compared to coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:04:04
Yeah that was my question if cashapp could compete with the .25%. But regardless I'll stick with Coinbase Pro because I'm used to it and Cashapp isn't available for me anyways
