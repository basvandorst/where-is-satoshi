No, because PayPal isn't a currency. Its a payment platform. You don't pay someone 20 PayPals, you pay them $20, or €20 or £20 or 20 whatevers, but in the currency of your choice.
Bitcoin, however, is a currency.

If its of any help, yes is an affirmative motion to am action, or confirmation of a statement.
