Turn uppp

Well, besides the fact you seem like you were paid to say that.. I can't say I agree. Not that I'm against taxes, but to tax gains on Bitcoin is ridiculous in my opinion. Let us have one piggy bank that the government doesn't reach into.

Time to buy, am I rite?

Circle has been good for me this last year. Some people have had complaints about them too, but I've never had problems. Be wary of any exchange though I guess.

I feel you, I get paid on Friday. Hoping the price stays down until then!

You act like saying 1 btc = 1 btc is some genius breakthrough statement. It's nonsense, really. One equals one... No shit. Bitcoin has no value if you don't tie it to tangible things like currencies or products. What gives something value is what you can trade it for. It's good to be passionate about Bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, so am I, but damn you people need to calm down.

Hah I like that
@_date: 2016-06-26 04:00:08
A social media website based around Bitcoin would be my guess.
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:33:08
Don't get paid til Friday :(
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:01:46
That's not cool, man. Be respectful. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:32:50
I miss Circle.

I could see it being popular in like twitter or facebook eventually, but I agree with you. Sites like Reddit really don't have much use for it. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 13:34:51
It is very popular in the US. It's the default messaging for iPhones. If you are connected to wifi it lets you keep texting people that also use iMessage. Nothing real special but it works well and lots of people use it exclusively here.

I would absolutely love to hear your dj work since you are so knowledgeable and wise in this field. Please do share!

Circle may not charge fees but it sure seems like they use a higher exchange rate than the average.

@_date: 2016-07-02 05:29:05
Where do people get the time to do all these lol
@_date: 2016-07-09 04:14:30
Also my new favorite theory

Hah I only started hodling in 2014. I guess three years isn't long enough to wait discussing a topic again?
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:18:24
I think they have plenty of time. Seems to me like they're pretty early to the party. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:10:41
I like you
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:16:14
We all were saying WU would die by Bitcoin but props to them for trying to adapt. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:44:47
Y'all are partying too hard for the halvening
@_date: 2016-07-09 04:11:45
I do like to tell myself I'm not materialistic..

Dropped a couple hundred when Eth was around $20 right before it took off. Turned out to be a great impulse buy. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:38:03
Thanks, that does make a lot of sense. It still seems easier than trying to figure out what say .16 bitcoins is equal to. Also, it would be to tough while volatility is still high to have to switch again to a different measure. That could get messy.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:07:19
Sorry for your loss :/ You didn't write the seed down?
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:02:09
If half the people in this subreddit don't even know about Aug 1 I don't really see people just learning about Bitcoin being discouraged by that. Who knows though lol
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:56:17
I wasn't set on mBTC. I think satoshis would be fine too :)
@_date: 2016-07-07 02:21:56
It's not impossible, but very unlikely. Just don't invest more than you are willing to lose and keep your coins in your own personal wallet as opposed to on exchanging. Welcome to the hodlers club!
