Dude I keep worrying if I'm buying too high too. Honestly we just have to say fuck it and throw money at it and not worry about it, the sooner you add money the better.

I'll hold it for you if it makes you feel better.

Go back to your sub.

We truly are on the cusp of the singularity.

Banks are required to inform the IRS of any deposits greater than 10k. However if you are depositing 9k every week it will definitely raise red flags. But this all depends on how much you are talking about. If it's a lot of money then you will need to pace it to a certain dollar amount each year depending on your other income.

The API definitely won't be removed.

If I treated it like gambling, that would mean I'd have to spend all my gains on significantly over priced booze haha.
Edit: maybe I should treat it like gambling...

Where did he buy them? That's first question that needs to be answered.

I mean the value of the USD or any currency is basically the demand for it. The US market volume is so insignificant compared to the forex volume which is where the value is decided on. So you could say the USD is speculative too, because it is.

Yeah but in a month from now a 25% drop could still very easily be a higher price than it is now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:41:15
Haha don't stress, just don't watch it and just pretend the money is already gone. You'll make more and feel better if you can manage to do this.

Make that a 15.5k word research paper... ^considering
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:22:41
It's not working right now : /

Personally I would just pretend that money didn't exist, and just forget about it for a month before checking on it.

Lol why is that marked as nsfw?

It's just down right now, says on the server status page that id verification is failing due to high traffic.

It normally takes me 6 days. But they always tell me it will take 7 days in the email confirmation.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:27:07
Yeah, but we're still up. I've already learned my lessons the hard way, I know trading in volatility is the fastest way to get burned and clearly everyone wants BTC so we will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:59:58
I agree. I'll take my coins now please.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:23:00
Right? It going up to nearly 20k then back to 15k in one day and a bunch of people panic as there was a bubble pop... all while I'm like, "but guys we are still up more than 1k from the day prior..."

My doctor told me to sit down, and said "I'm sorry son but you're too stupid to time the market perfectly. You'll have to invest money like a reasonable person." I don't know if I can continue to live knowing this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:56:20
Haha I mean I do the same, but if you can easily not get emotional and not ask "what if" then you should be good.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:59:53
But what if I draw random lines on a chart or look for candle patterns, surely that's able to predict the future?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:05:14
So many people think TA tells them something about the future, rather than only the past.
