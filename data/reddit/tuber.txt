You've got the general idea of the block reward, but miners also collect transaction fees. As the block reward declines over the next 120 years, value of the transaction fees will eventually surpass that of the block reward. I believe there have already been a few blocks with tx fees that exceed the block reward.  
The details are nicely explained in the [bitcoin whitepaper]( which I highly recommend reading.

Looking into this a bit further, the 32-bit nonce overflows (by convention not protocol) to extraNonce which is included in the coinbase transaction. So changing the coinbase, not the timestamp, is probably what miners tend to do. But any of the methods mentioned in the last few comments could be used to produce a valid block.

There no need to trust the buyer in any way. For on-chain transactions, you look for the transaction to appear on *your* wallet/device/service. Your wallet/device/service gets its information from the blockchain. 
If the transaction value is high or you determine that fraud is likely, you can wait some minutes for the transaction to be accepted into a block (1 confirmation) and perhaps a few more blocks to be appended to the blockchain (multiple confirmations) before delivering your product/service to the buyer. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:32:14
We have already seen blocks where the transaction fees exceed the current block reward of 12.5 BTC. As the reward gradually approaches zero over the next 120 years, transaction fees become the overwhelming majority of miners' revenue. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:22:16
Miners are so fast (and nonces so few) that all nonces for a particular block are checked in a fraction of a second. The miner must then change something else within the candidate block to get a hash that works. 
Any change to timestamp, coinbase, or included transactions will suffice. Timestamp is typically the low hanging fruit.

The transaction is pending because it takes nearly a week for the ACH transaction to clear. This friction is coming from the legacy financial network, not from CB. CB uses their own funds to secure your BTC purchase immediately, locking in the purchase price while both you and CB wait for the bank transaction to complete. 
While no business is without flaws, the negative sentiment towards CB is, in my opinion, blown out of proportion. Some of it may be driven by parties who wish to harm the bitcoin ecosystem by damaging trust in a major onramp for BTC investors.

Any seller on amazon can list their inventory on the main product page, include prime shipping, etc. And inventory of identical products at amazon warehouses may be co-mingled among multiple sellers. So when you buy a product, they pull one from the bin in a warehouse near you (which saves them money on shipping and warehousing) on the assumption that all products from all sellers are equal. Unfortunately, this allows the scammer to insert tampered product into genuine product inventory. 
Long story short, Amazon's distribution/fulfillment model is not hardened to this attack vector.  Please do report this to Amazon as the actions of a malicious seller (rather than a faulty product) so they can fix the security flaw in their supply chain.
