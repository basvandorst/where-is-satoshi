Gox was the majority shareholder for a very long time, and then quickly dried up through mistakes. There was definitely a reason that long-standing websites and people used their price as the BTC price.
People have gotten money out of there and there have been opportunities that MT Gox's price was under other exchanges so you could get out at a gain. Additionally, people lucky enough to have a US bank AND JPN bank have been able to sell out this entire time.
$1,200 did exist and was the highest real trade values. That, however, was not a price people would use to sell goods with because it was artificially inflated from withdrawal limits. Thus buying anywhere else, or on localbtc, or goods/services... you needed a more realistic price at the same time.
Since bitcoin is volatile, small mkt cap, and ever-changing... it's good we have such a fluid definition of price. Bartering 2.0

Stop shilling for Kraken. Yes, Kraken is a great system, but **you are missing the point.**
This isn't just effecting the trades, this is effecting **the entire network**.
Transactions aren't going through because of a million bugs caused by DOS attack exploiting this vulnerability. Tons of spoof transactions are exploiting everyone's tx hashes and messing stuff up. We'll recover and no one will lose coin, but this is a big issue for a real economy to suffer.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:38:07
There was money lost in such transactions as the ones of mine that didn't go through, this hurts the economy but only momentarily.
I wouldn't say you sugar coated it, that is a good explanation of what occurred. Sugar coating it posts will be like "THIS IS A GOOD THING!" and state that there were no issues or "THIS IS NOT A BITCOIN PROBLEM" and go back to blaming companies. It's now obviously a bitcoin problem - the DDOS attack is the real problem going on.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:28:00
MTGox obviously made a loud obnoxious ruckus which gave bad people a good idea... I think we're all pretty much in agreeance that they are too stupid to plot out this "another life" strategy.
The often right answer to a mystery is often the simplest one.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:50:00
Me too, look at this DDOS targeting the exploit and destroying everyone's ability to make transactions! I had two purchases from my mobile coinbase wallet not working - I was upset at coinbase - but instead it appears to be everyone on the entire network experiencing problems.
MTGox exposed something like idiots and that caught attention from DoS asshats... but it exposed how large this problem was the whole time.
This is actually the biggest issue I've ever seen in bitcoin. A specific bug can be targeted to gimp our ability to transact? That's insanely bad.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:26:08
They were correct with bad intent.
Everyone else was incorrect with neutral intent.
I don't know which is better for MT Gox in my eyes - they're beyond reparable to me. I hate them most for the customer service bots. But, for bitcoin, what occurred was the best option.
Maybe their intent wasn't even all that bad. They said the most truthful thing than everyone else did. This is a problem *with bitcoin*. They really are dolts, I bet they likely said what they meant with zero intent.

Apparently the idiots start commenting around 24 hours after you post something. Interesting.
You clearly didn't read or understand what issue is going on right now. You embarrass me, do us a favor and stop hitting reply when discussing bitcoin.

Yes, sadly I lost some money. I'm not upset but here's the story anyway.
These were both pending or lost until literally this hour:
The bottom transaction was the price last night when I made the purchase. The transaction did not meet Bitpay's 15min time limit (and the transaction disappeared after pending for 12 hours or so, mysteriously it came back now).
Today, after talking to the merchant, I re-paid. The bitcoin price has dropped and I ended up paying more. Oh well, who cares.
As of right now, the first transaction re-appeared and completed. So, I am out over $100 at the moment. When all is said and done, I expect to be out ~$20 due to volatility and issues.
There is also sunk costs that occurred for coinbase, bitpay, this merchant, and the bitcoin economy as a whole.

The capability to DOS attack bitcoin is pretty easy... this gave the idea of a direct weakness to exploit. Likely if we could figure out who DOS attacked the dark web markets, bitcoin exchanges in the past, and others then we would find the source.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:25:14
The bigger issue is the DDOS attack that is now attacking bitcoin's entire network with this exploit. The exchanges and who-did-what no longer matter... this is a problem with bitcoin itself.

He is, great shop - highly suggest it! Hookahonmars.com they accept multiple cryptos and the site is the best vape / hookah shop I've found anywhere online.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:13:19
Yep, and most people seem to be just learning that this is a vulnerable point for DDOS attacks to screw with transactions. Right now, 50% of my transactions are even going through. 
The biggest issue is in maliciously attacking this exploit on a massive scale. Can't wait to read people's explanations sugar-coating it.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:03:41
TL;DR [In the end, MTGox did everyone a huge favor.](
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:14:28
Lost me funds. Nice sugar coating with your use of "issue".
Issue = bug
Known issue != bug?
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:39:11
Just think if bitcoin matured and then this became an issue? I made a purchase last night that wouldn't go through and one today that took 10 minutes to get past pending on Coinbase.
They exposed another big bitcoin weakness in the only way they know how to - the worst, most idiotic way.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:33:32
Like ~1100.
You miss the point about imaginary or not. Mt Gox did and still does exist. They transfer high volumes of currencies, not just digital. So... really you're a bit of a fool with a stupid question. Bitcoins were bought and sold for 1200+. That is a fact.
The highest transaction was a few coins @ 3,400$ on Kraken when an idiot put in a market order and they have zero liquidity.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:36:29
Paying more in bitcoin, which from a day ago costs more per fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:31:41
One of mine has been endlessly stuck. I saw that Silk Road DDOS last 2 weeks once. But, you know what I'm talking about here.
Good news is... you are not in danger of losing any coins.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:06:54
You, along with 99% of reddit here, are oblivious to the DDOS attack that has crippled then entire network's ability to transfer bitcoins. I had two purchases fail and the DDOS is targeting the exploit MTGox warned of.
This isn't just software changes on websites now. It's a targetable weakness that effects everything.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:57:22
Nope, they did this exactly correct strangely enough. The extent of this problem is much more far-reaching than anyone here seems to understand.
Right now, the protocol itself is failing on transactions and buggy because a DOS attack is replicating the bug to the entire network on any/all transactions. Since bitcoin is so small, we barely even notice it unless you've tried sending BTC in the last day.
This isn't about wbesites doing a patch. This is about addressing a needed change to bitcoin to protect it (or a change to all software interacting with bitcoin). This is an extremely good bug to find before this thing is mainstream in any sense.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:44:59
It was downvoted until I added that line, actually.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:40:28
Yeah, sort this by new. Look how long it takes the dumbest people in to really start commenting.
There is a breaking point of comments on reddit. At first your post is tested and if it's worthy then people begin to discuss the topic. At some point, too many people comment so the dumbest new viewers don't read, just hit reply.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:42:27
Cool, it can be both. Don't think for a second that what you mention is even a piece of the hurdle(s) keeping bitcoin off FX.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:35:49


I fixed your sentence since you obviously contradicted yourself. You're welcome, dummy.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:38:44
Google who runs MTGox. They are not culturally Japanese.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:12:13
You're delusional. I hope that is a joke.
