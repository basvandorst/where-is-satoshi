Well, you know all banks are middlemen... That's their whole purpose. They connect people with capital (you as the depositor) with people that need capital (credit, loans). So I guess you could loan money directly or buy bonds directly, but that is all way hardier than using middlemen who take away risk (banks, brokerages).

This is the part that makes no sense. The only coins for sale on the order book (limit orders) are ABOVE the current asking price. You can't have orders for less than that otherwise they would be executed. So whatever quantity you want to buy, you can only buy it at or above current asking price, not below.

What are you talking about?  Do you mean you can SELL 18,000 coins for $150M?  You can only crash the market by selling.

It's *good* that the value of the dollar is guaranteed to drop. That's how the economy works. Deflationary spirals aren't a good thing.

Savings accounts are guaranteed to increase in (nominal) value and even insured as such. This is a speculative investment, the exact opposite.

Yeah, because it will be positive in the long run lol. 
You need to accept that all crypto can go down to 0 as well, not just any upside you might dream of. Because of this, you can't "treat it as such".
