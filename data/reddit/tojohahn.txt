Violence is not immoral as it is natural. Just as the lion eats the gazelle.

Pay taxes for government services -&gt; Your comment about drone bombing people -&gt; Drone bombing is done to protect American interests in the Middle East (OIL) -&gt; oil is cheaper in the U.S. because of our involvement in the Middle East
Was it really that hard or were you intentionally being obtuse?

Lol, the American govenment keeps the profits of big oil down. Your delusional to think otherwise.

Most banks report all deposits regardless of amount from suspicious sources such as bitcoin exchanges.  There is not magic number to get around AML programs.

No.  Most AML/BSA programs report all deposits from suspicious sources such as bitcoin markets regardless of dollar amount to the government.   It's a Patriot act requirement.
In fact if you are only doing $1k a week to avoid reporting you are committing a felony called structuring.

US citizens pay taxes on money earned abroad. Trying to hide it in a Dutch bank account is still tax evasion.

Big oil is controlled by big government, not the other way around.

Yep, it has helped to get keep your oil cheap.  Unless you prefer to pay $15/gallon.

Everything you said here is factually incorrect.  You are conflating legal tender and currency.  The IRS recognizes bitcoin as a stateless currency. 
And yes the IRS can tax income you earn in other currency otherwise it would be tax free to become an expat.

When you are the bigger beast you feed yourself.

It's in America's interest to oil prices low and not the oil corporations. Do you not know how basic economics work? Also we are not talking about more government,  we are talking about tax laws already in place.

Lol, if we Americans got taxed that much I might be as crazy of a Libertarian as you.
