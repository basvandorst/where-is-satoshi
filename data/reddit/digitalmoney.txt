I agree that the environment is rather unprofessional.  Imagine a "important business person" thinking of embracing Bitcoin and checking out the forum. they would come to the conclusion that the half of the bitcoin community are 12 years with tourettes who squabble over everything and personally attack each other.  And the other half can't work out the basics of bitcoin like getting their miner runner.  
Of course bitcointalk is not an official forum, and i think it is good to have a space where everyone can voice their opinion.  But maybe (if it doesn't already exist?) it would be good it the key developers/ merchants/service providers created a invite only forum that anyone could read but only the invited could post.  But then this raises the problem of who should be in charge of such a thing?  Does someone being in charge go against the point of Bitcoin?

Fast is a relative term really.  What should be asking is "is 225 good for the hardware I'm using?" Look at this site it will give you an indication 
Don't necessarily expect to get the top results you see on that site, but hopefully you will be somewhat close.
I used bitclockers a bit, didn't see anything wrong with it.
Also you should check this profit calculator out.  Hopefully it doesn't discourage you too much.  But with 225 you won't be rolling in Bitcoins so to speak.

I've been thinking the same, I'd like one and have the money to buy 1 or 3, but from the sounds of it the backorder could be kind of large, and now that they have started to ship and people have shown them to work i assume its growing everyday

I'm sure they are consistently laughing their ass off while thinking about the money they have made already.  Even if half the users leave they will still be laughing about how much money they are making.  And if one day they shut down because they have become that unpopular they will spend the rest of their days laughing on top of their big pile of money being glad they don't have to actually work anymore

I think a big factor in what happens when the reward splits is how established has the bitcoin economy become.  By which I mean is there a fair amount of people who use bitcoins in their daily lives.  If there is then they will still be needing a semi constant supply of them.  And with supply down price will go up.  Thats a simplification of course, because as the price goes up each person needs less and less bitcoins each day to "accomplish" the same thing, whether that means buying a pair of socks every week, or playing poker or whatever.
If the economy is not well established and the supply outweighs the demand for people actually using bitcoins then what happens will be left up to speculators/hoarders.  And its hard to predict how that will go, as we have seen good bitcoin news makes prices go up, and very recently bad makes them go down.  I assume prices will go up at least a bit if it left up to speculators, but I have no idea how much, 20%, double, triple i don't know

There is a gui miner, i haven't used it.  Ill try to give you a real quick maybe some steps missing step up with Phoenix miner.  Hope you have windows, its all i have experience with mining.
1) go here 
scroll down until you see Download, click on Windows binaries and download.
2)extract it someplace, C:\Program Files\PMiner for example
3) sign up with a pool.
4)open the command line Start&gt;&gt;search or run cmd
5) change the directory to the folder your miner is in.  In this example type cd C:\Program Files\PMiner
6) start miner, pools provide the proper settings in some kind of help page, you basically just have to copy and paste what is there and put your username/password where it says to

Unless you have one hell of a setup you are pretty much just adding a drop to a ocean... or whatever that metaphor is.

Not sure if you are serious, I'm going to assume people don't use the term where ever you live.  A bank branch is just a bank.  Using the same terminology, the McDonalds that you go to would be your "McDonalds branch"

Yes keep it simple.  I think people some get a little full of themselves when asked "how would you describe bitcoin?" and try to spout off impressive words/ all their knowledge about it
Personally i like this description Coinabul gave a couple days ago:
What exactly are bitcoins: Internet Money.
How do you use them: Exactly the same way you use Paypal. You simply transfer bitcoins from your wallet to a Bitcoin address.
How do you get them: There are plenty of ways to exchange USD for BTC (bitcoins). Bank deposits, wires, you can even pay for them with Paypal if you're the adventurous type.

Nothing stops them from that, If I was going to steal a bunch I'd send them around to dozens of wallets before trying to do anything with them. 
People keep parroting "They should accept bitcoins" (in regards to businesses, or even countries).  If I'm trying to run a business I might need those coins right now for any number of reasons.  They fact that someone took it upon themselves to do some damage control is not going to be enough to sooth over my employees or suppliers who I owe money to but cant pay.

yes, those who have any experience in mining  bitcoin/namecoin have probably put 2 and 2 together, but for the sake of those recently joining the bit/name coin community this person has had poor experiences with the Davincij15 mining pool and is encouraging others to make sure they are not being scammed  more or less

If you are limited to credit card you can do dwolla or use liberty reserve at several exchanges.
If you have a paypal account you can find people on one of the boards at bitcoitalk.org or bitcoin-otc.com, or several other places where you can do personal trades.  You can use other payment methods on these places too, basically whatever the person you are dealing with will accept, personal cheques, mailed cash, gift cards, sacks of potatoes, clean their house for a week, and so on..
If you happen to be Canadian you can do bank account transfer (interact transfer? i forget the name...) with cavirtex.com I have had nothing but good experience with them.  
Several exchanges also accept international bank transfers

0.3.21 still works good for me
@_date: 2012-02-13 03:52:48
Im not commenting on any of these attacks to date, but I think faking an attack and claiming "all our bitcoins were stolen" will be a common thing in the future.  Could make it difficult for new services to get off the ground due to lack of trust... which is good and bad i guess.

What do you mean takes bitcoin?  Is this one of those games where you can play for like 5 minutes, then you have to wait like 10 hours or pay money for more "turns" 
@_date: 2012-02-07 08:31:20
This is an interesting point.  It could create a new kind of corporation that is able to play by a new set, or maybe their own set of rules.  
The problem of course is bitcoins instability. Compared to when it shot up around 30ish USD then came crashing down it might seem stable, but compared to traditional currencies its not.  But to be fair some some this would be a selling point and for others it would be...what ever you call the opposite of a selling point

I've heard it has been removed from newer versions because unless you have quite the setup solo mining is pretty unreasonable.  I use an older version still, it does have a mining option.  You will want to get a miner and join a pool.
@_date: 2012-03-26 15:02:46
Its good that you lead by example by not stooping to sarcastic tones, dam there I go too...

It doesnt matter if the person you are trusting is anonymous or your best friend.  They can both say my wallet was hacked! here is the transaction that proves it.  But of course that transaction can easily be them transferring coins from their one address to another one of their addresses

I think sfacets is saying the very poor do not have the hardware and can not afford it.  He didnt say anything about the system being unfair.

I dont think facebook qualifies as holding any monopolies, but if they do and this becomes an issue for them they can just relocate to a country that doesn't have these laws

But isn't the interest on BTC  basically 0?  And isn't the interest on USD ridiculous (by which i mean not sustainable)?   
@_date: 2012-02-23 08:54:51
I think that is kind of an unfair thought  Not everyone who supports bitcoin has the disposable income to buy such a thing.  
And not everyone buying these are doing it for the good of bitcoin, just for the good of themselves.

I have heard that bitmit actively stops fraudulent postings. Does this site also take such steps to protect shoppers?
@_date: 2012-02-24 08:53:10
Yes, Paypal probably does not want to be seen as a supporter of bitcoin at this point in time

its not 100% proof.  I could send you a bunch of drugs to your house, address it to you and you would have no idea.
