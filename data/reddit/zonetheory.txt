As someone who has bought different cryptocurrencies, I feel like we are in the midst of a bubble. I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of angry responses calling me ignorant, retarded, etc. but I think it's important to think about cryptocurrencies in an economics framework. The basic question right now is why would someone buy bitcoin right now? Many will say the technology, decentralization, etc. but I would say a good 95% maybe more are buying it because they think the price will rise in the future. Less top 500 retailers are accepting it than two years ago yet the price has gone from $400 to $18,000 in a matter of a few years. So in reality most people are treating bitcoin as an investment, which is problematic because it's value as a commonly used currency declines if people are afraid to use it because they think the price will rise in the future.

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:27:58
Or maybe it's because the average fee to send any amount of Bitcoin is around $60

Unlike Bitcoin, gold is used in almost all computers and cell phones, as well as jewelry, dentistry, and aircraft.

The time will never come as long as people continue buying expecting the price to rise. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:17:13
This is moronic, especially  The point of a currency is to be used, when people stop using it to buy goods and services it becomes a speculative asset. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:24:43
Last year, bitcoin was accepted at five of the top 500 online retailer but this year that number has dropped to three, yet the price has risen from $1,000 at the beginning of the year to over $19,000 earlier this month. So utility has gone down yet the price has skyrocketed, which means people aren't really bitcoin as a currency but more as an investment. The problem here is one of economics, if you think bitcoin is going to rise in price you have little incentive to spend it on goods and services. People are buying bitcoin not because they plan to buy goods and services with it (hint Dell, OkCupid, Steam, are among the list of companies no longer accepting bitcoin) but because they anticipate the price will go to $20,000, $50,000, or $1,000,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:06:24
If you had $50,000 in a stock, wouldn't you want to see it go up? In the crypto space where people are largely buying coins as investments, you're loosing money if you're not hyping your own coin so to speak. I don't think this is a difficult concept to grasp. A similar example is a supplement company making false claims to get people to buy their products.

How is the network going to experience widespread adoption if it can barely handle .00025% of what Visa processes per second?

That's a false equivalency. Gold is used in electronics, spacecraft, jewelry, and tooth fillings among others. Bitcoin is just a series of 1's and 0's.

They can regulate it's usage to a degree. They can ban businesses from accepting bitcoin which would provide a big hit to it's value.

It will be interesting to see when the intense price manipulation ends.

Good luck buying basic goods and services.

You ever hear of a user called spoofy?
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:31:12
Sorry it was too tempting. The issue I see which made me more or less lose interest in this space is the fact that most people see bitcoin as an investment, which hinders mass adoption. I would never trade my MU shares for goods because I think it's going to go up substantially in value withing the next two years and the mindset for bitcoin is no different. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:56:34
Rational behavior 101, don't spend anything you think is going to go up in value which is the very thing preventing bitcoin from being used as a currency. Even with Segwit and Lightning Network coming out people still don't have a want or need to use bitcoin to buy goods and services except maybe some bitcoin rollercoaster meme stickers to show "mass adoption" is here. I hate to plug my investments, but if someone said hey I'll sell you an xbox for 5 shares of MU stock, I would tell them no way because Micron is going to go up 30&amp; by next year. Bitcoin is no different and provides an excellent example of why some inflation is a good thing when it comes to currencies.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:41:09
It's more of a reflection of economic mismanagement than anything. Most countries don't have any issue with rampant inflation and people are still able to buy goods and services with their "evil fiat".
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:05:27


What's hurting mass adoption of any cryptocurrency is people treating it like an investment. If you think something is going to go up in value dramatically in the future, what rationale is there to spend it?
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:24:50
Most major governments have to interest in having bitcoin takeover their fiat currencies, whether it be Dollars, Yuan, Yen, Pesos, Rupees, etc and most citizens don't care as long as they can buy goods and services, which seems to be the case in most of the world except Venezuela.

Even thought certain cops can be dicks, I would rather have a military/police force as opposed to utter lawlessness like the plot of 'The Purge'. I can't imagine any rational person wanting that.

Nothing says mass adoption like a few quilt shops in Iowa.

How can it be an income producing asset if it doesn't pay a dividend? If people bought Bitcoin in January they would have lost a lot of money by now. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:20:53
100&amp; true, I certainly have no problems buying goods and services with my dollars and even get cash back on my credit card every year. People here take for granted having a police force, military, hospitals, etc. that are funded by tax dollars. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:17:55
Bitcoin's perceived value is for it to be a common medium of exchange in the future aka a currency. When you treat it as an investment (HODL) it's value as a currency declines. As an investment, it is hardly different than cheaper clones like Peercoin that do the exact same thing albeit have a shorter blockchain. This is why more people should be bearish on bitcoin even though the idea is new and exciting.

@_date: 2018-03-30 05:40:24
It's simple human behavior, people don't want to spend something that they think will go up 10x in the future. Bitcoin has been anything but stable in the past, so I see no reason that will change anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:06:52
I've heard that argument before and I've thought about it a lot. If that were to happen, and say I have $20,000 cash in my bank account, why would I spend money on something (bitcoin) that is going to be stable and not increase in value vs a stock that I know will go up in value and/or pay me a dividend? Also, who decides when this point is reached, is it 5x the current price, 10x, 100x?
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:01:11
Doesn't provide any sort of argument but okay. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:40:21
Want bitcoin to succeed? Stop seeing it as an investment and stop trying to get rich from it.

When you say some people use it as a currency, we are probably talking about less than 1% of people who own bitcoin. People will almost always choose to spend something they think will decline in value vs something they think will go up in value, it's just rational human behavior. Of course, there are the bitcoin hodlers who will buy a bitcoin sticker here and there or maybe a cheap computer monitor to show how bitcoin "adoption" is growing. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:56:45
Bitcoin could go back to $400 where it was in 2014 and the world would continue on like nothing happened. If this kind of drop happened with the Dollar, Euro, Yuan, or Pound there would be a disastrous effect on the world economy. Just some perspective.
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:00:53
First off it's not funny, secondly it doesn't add anything to the conversation. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:05:46
This hasn't been the case with the stock market, bitcoin's gains in 2016 and 2017 have far exceeded those of any stock. This effect would be magnified if a country only had bitcoin as it's sole currency. On top of that, if people had the option to spend an inflationary currency like the dollar, they would choose it over bitcoin day and night. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:50:40
If you are a society that only has bitcoin as it's currency, and lets say you're only spending that on bread, water, and rent. That pretty much limits your interest in investing in anything really, whether it's technology or medicine, especially if bitcoin continues to be scarce and will also go up in price. Keep in mind bitcoin's gains this year have been far more impressive than the stock market's rallies.

I've said this many times before but I'm gonna say it again, bitcoin stops being a currency when people think of it as an investment.

I was the same way with a certain stock that burned me. Stubbornness and unwillingness to listen to differing viewpoints will certainly lose you a lot of money. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:14:14
Can't be both, there is no incentive to spend something you think is going to go up in value. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:53:48
If you never spend it, pretty much stops being a currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:19:05
Deflationary currencies simply don't work as a common medium of exchange. It's rational to not want to use bitcoin to buy goods and services if you think the price is going to go up 10x in the future. Unfortunately there's no way around this, unless you implement some inflationary measures in bitcoin and I'm sure all the hodlers would love that. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:05:47
Changing the subject from your estimation but sure, deflation increases the purchasing power of a currency.

What makes bitcoin a better store of value than Vertcoin, Litecoin, or any other bitcoin clone that is priced much lower than bitcoin? If you could make infinite copies of Gold it would most certainly lose it's value as a store of value, not to mention it's use in computers and cell phones while bitcoin is just a series of 1's and 0's. As a disclaimer, I don't own and gold and am just using it as an example.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:17:38
Investment drives major economies though, unless you want to live in a primitive Country where people are just spending money on food, water, and clothing.

I am well of bitcoin's fixed supply, as for your deflation estimate it sounds like you just pulled it out of your ass. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:21:17
Nobody knows the true value of bitcoin, that is why it went all the way up to $20,000 and then back down to $5,500 where we are now. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:40:29
What makes it a store of value if it has no tangible qualities and can be replicated infinitely? Although I don't see Gold as a particularly good investment, it's status as a store of value makes some sense since it is used in nearly all computers and cell phones. You could also argue that vertcoin or any other bitcoin clone is just as good of a store of value since the underlying technology is actually the same. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:52:37
Cryptocurrencies stop being currencies when people start thinking about them as investments. You would never use something for purchases if you think the price is going to go up 100x what it is right now. People in the crypto space also seem to get irate when you suggest that currencies should be stable. Just something to consider. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:56:12
Bitcoin's gains have been due to speculation though, not increasing adoption. There are less top 500 online retailers accepting bitcoin than there were three years ago, yet the price has risen from $400 if I recall correctly to $7,000 where it stands today. I have also yet to physically encounter a business that accepts bitcoin. How are you arriving at your estimate for under 1% deflation?
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:15:07
I've been following that one for a while actually. Chinese stocks are getting hammered. I'm pretty confident that the GDP numbers out of China are fake and learned that the company in hong kong that audits chinese companies cannot be subject to audit by american auditors. Now I understand why they trade at a steep discount among other reasons. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:38:23
99.9% of the people here are not in it for "the technology", they're here to get rich. Investment /= currency, the only way bitcoin will ever succeed as a currency is when people stop trying to get rich from it which I don't see every happening. There's no incentive to buy goods and services with something you think is going to up in value in the future. Doesn't really have value as an asset either, doesn't pay a dividend, doesn't represent ownership stake in a company, or anything besides represent something that can be replicated infinitely or be replaced by a better technology in the future.

You're missing the point, bitcoin stops being a currency when you treat it like an investment. Imagine you are in a country where bitcoin was the sole currency.

"The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system." The last part certainly sounds like a ban on it's use in payment for goods in services. I think the threat of fines and penalties would be enough to discourage any business from accepting it.

This is a false equivalency though. Gold is used in jewelry, electronics(cell phones and computers), tooth fillings, etc. but bitcoin is just a series of 1's and 0's.

Bitcoin will never be a widely used currency for one principle reason: you would rarely buy goods and services with something you think is going to go up in value. This is basic economics and the major crux of a deflationary currency.

Cryptocurrency follower who will probably get a lot of hate for this comment. Bitcoin is a great concept but needs a lot of work. The network is seeing an average of 9 transactions per second and the average fee is now around $5.50. Imagine what astronomical fees users would experience if the bitcoin network experienced the same volume as Visa (20,000+). Fees aside, bitcoin prides itself on being decentralized, but hasn't bitcoin become extremely centralized with a few miners controlling all of the hashpower and making the important decisions just like a bank.
