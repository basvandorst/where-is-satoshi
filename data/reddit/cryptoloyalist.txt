This is what I try to do but sadly it's very difficult in Thailand to find anywhere to spend it. But I do make the odd bet on footy with it, usually lose :) then top up my account next week. I'm trying!

I believe China is trying to position itself and it's own internal economy so it would not suffer too much from a US economic collapse.

China has lots of land but I think not much of it is arable, less than 20 percent if I remember right... So that would explain why they're doing this

I don't want to diversify. I was born poor and would've stayed poor all my life if I hadn't bought bitcoin when it was around $400. It's allowed me to buy a house and a car in cash, and do lots of traveling. Now I'm going to start my own business - all with the profits I've made. And I simply cannot see bitcoin going anywhere else but up in the long term, so I still have all my remaining savings in it. There is absolutely no chance I'd have made anywhere near as much money if I'd invested in anything else, and I believe the same is true for the future too. So I'll keep it all where it is, Thank you :)

Someone should petition Trump for a pardon, he's unpredictable enough that he might just sign off on it to piss off the FBI or someone else
