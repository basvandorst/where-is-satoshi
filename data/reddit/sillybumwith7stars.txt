That is entirely due to your own skillset, and not an inherent aspect of server-side vs client-side security. In a server-side scenario, I have to trust your server to run an unaltered version of the code, while in a client-side scenario where I download the code from your server, I have to trust your server to host an unaltered version of the code.
The difference here is that in the client-side scenario, I have the option to review the code before running it. Which was my initial point :)

Anyway, the incentive for a miner to include transactions is obviously to make sure the market value of the mined bitcoins stays high enough to get a positive ROI on their mining investment. Not including transactions would destroy Bitcoin's utility, and the miner's investment would become worthless.


That's actually a good point. But the only reason for a miner NOT to include a transaction is if there is a cost associated with doing so. But the direct cost (as in increased usage of resources) of including a transaction in a block is absolutely marginal. However, there is an indirect cost of including a transaction in a block because a larger block has a higher orphaning risk, which would mean losing the mining reward. The best estimate of this cost can be found in [Peter R.'s paper regarding the emergent fee market in absence of a block limit](

Thank you for this!
A friend of mine runs a little webshop, and I've convinced her to add bitcoin payment as an option. This wasn't an easy task because the whole website is wordpress based and she had to ask the guys who did her website to implement a bitcoin payment option, which after much back and forth they finally did. She accepts zero-conf transactions, and while she only gets a low number of customers using bitcoin, she never had an issue with double spending or the like. It worked perfectly fine.
Now even with opt-in RBF, it would be very easy to rip her off, because her implementation is not ready for this. And she's not a very technical person at all, and generally doesn't know what's going on in the bitcoin space. All she does is accept bitcoin on her webshop.
So I now have to explain to her that she needs to contact her web developer again, and ask them to update their wordpress implementation of the bitcoin payment option to support this new opt-in RBF patch. This will cost her money. And I'm not even sure the guy handling all this on the backend knows about opt-in RBF himself, so this guy probably has to research the whole thing, making it more costly and probably delaying the results.
The other option for her is to simply say it's not worth the trouble and drop the bitcoin payment option again. And even if she does decide to keep it despite the additional cost, she would then have to explain on her website that zero-conf is only acceptable without opt-in RBF, and otherwise the customer would have to wait for at least one confirmation before getting his payment recognized. Or stop accepting zero-conf completely (which is likely the goal of this stupid opt-in RBF patch in the first place). This will do nothing but confuse the few customers using bitcoin, probably pushing some of them to just use paypal instead. 
Total lose-lose situation here. Good job core devs! And this situation isn't even the worst case because she has someone like me telling her about this kind of stuff. Other people accepting bitcoin might not be so lucky.

If it's dripping out of the system, then where is it going? The only ressource expended by miners is electricity. So if it's dripping out of the system, it has to go towards electricity. And electricitry is used for hashing and contributes directly to PoW security.

I think his point is that an orphaned block would have contributed to an increase in difficulty over time had it not been orphaned. However, I'm not really sure if this effect really is that simple, and I'm even less sure about whether an increase in mining difficulty in itself relates to an increase in PoW security in the first place.

Bitcoin Core has the `importprivkey` command line option to import a private key. 
The easiest way would be to manually create a transaction in coinb.in using that private key and send them to a new address which is already part of whatever wallet you're using. I'd offer you to do this for you if you send me the private key and the new address, but that's an offer you really shouldn't take.

I have only looked at the graph and not read the paper yet, so sorry if I'm wrong here.
But it seems to me that you are still assuming that orphaning risk induces a real cost on miners, which reduces their net profit margin. What I was trying to get at is that this is not the case: the cost associated with orphaning risk is not a real cost, and therefore does not affect profit margins *after the fact* of deciding to include a transaction due to its sufficiently high fees, which only offset the "virtual" opportunity cost of not including this transaction.
Maybe to make this a little bit clearer: I'm talking about mining as a whole here, which is relevant when looking at fee contribution to PoW security. From the perspective of a single miner of course, the orphaning risk does reduce their individual profit margin, because they will lose some of their revenue due to orphaned blocks. But this lost revenue of one miner is additional revenue of a different miner, whose block got included in the longest chain instead. So the orphaning risk does not induce a net cost on mining as a whole, because it is not a real cost caused by expending ressources, but only an opportunity cost for each individual miner which influences the allocation of the same total fee revenue (given a certain equlibrium state) among all the miners.

Anyone can make this claim. OP could be trying to scam them for all we know.
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:14:22


Well, yes and no.
Orphan risk is a cost from the perspective of an individual miner who is trying to maximize his profit. Thus each individual miner is incentivized to consider the orphaning risk of adding a transaction, and evaluate whether this is worth it for him by comparing this risk with the tx fee. Is the fee enough to compensate the miner for the orphaning risk, then his rational decision would be to include the transaction in an attempt to get the fee revenue for himself, before a different miner gets it. It's basically an expected value calculation of including a transaction vs the expected value of not including this same transaction.
But orphan risk is NOT a cost from the perspective of the whole mining network. The orphan risk instead is part of an allocation mechanism, where each miner competes against all other miners to get fee revenue. But the price money is fixed (the sum of all available tx fees), and miners are expending PoW in order to try to get a big share of it as possible. But all miners combined will always get the max amount of available fees which are in equilibrium with the sum of the individual orphan risk costs of every miner.
Orphan risk cost doesn't "sustain" fees, that makes no sense. What sustains fees is the demand for transactions to get included in a block. Orphan risk costs are just part of the game of miners who compete against each other. They're not a real cost, they're simply opportunity costs to be considered when making the decision whether to include a transaction or not.

Even if it kinda worked like that, it still wouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:40:06
True. But difficulty is lower for all the miners. So if an attacker decides to mine only small blocks to take advantage of the fact that honest miners are trading orphan risk for fees, it would simply change the game for the honest miners (by increasing their own orphaning rate), and they would have to start mining smaller blocks themselves to stay competitive, thus negating the attack. This would lead to more blocks mined due to overall reduced orphaning rate, and the difficulty would rise accordingly, making the attack more costly to perform again.
In the end, difficulty is an arbitrary parameter anyway. Its only goal is to keep block time around 10 minutes. Difficulty is in no way a security relevant aspect of the network, only hashing power counts here (ignoring decentralization of course).
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:30:43

Oh okay, sorry for the confusion then. I assumed that it would just let you earn small amounts of satoshis per click, similar to most other faucets. So after clicking the links and nothing happened, I assumed that I needed to sign up first, which prompted me for an email address.
Maybe I'm just not the brightest bulb in the box, but it wasn't obvious to me that this is more like a lottery with a chance to win per click. Maybe it could inform the user after every click, letting them know that they haven't won this round, but can still win if they keep trying? Also, what is preventing me from just spam clicking the links until I win?

It will always be barely sufficient to pay for miners' electricity costs. Such is the nature of the marginal cost of production. Which means your "argument" is completely void of any meaning here.
The question should rather be whether the block reward subsidy can guarantee the appropriate level of security for the Bitcoin blockchain by incentivizing enough miners to participate in securing it. That unfortunately is not an easy question to answer.

That sums up the nebulous doubts I had in my head pretty well. Curious to read some more opinions. Right now I am very unconvinced that there actually is any kind of correlation between orphaning risk and a reduction in PoW security (based on hashing power) at all.
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:20:40
If you're not concerned about privacy issues (i.e. people being able to check your sales volume in bitcoin), then re-using the same address isn't really a problem. There are some very minor security concerns when re-using the same address for *sending* bitcoins, but the real-world implications of that are mostly theoretical.
Ideally however you'd find a way to generate a new payment address for every customer/payment. Don't ask me how though (I'm sure there's some solutions available somewhere).
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:18:23
But you're looking at the profit maximization of **a single miner**. When you consider mining as a whole instead (which really should be considered as a whole when talking about PoW security), then orphaned blocks don't result in reduced revenue, because some miner *always* gets the revenue. 
Therefore oprhaning risk is not a real cost (as in expended ressources), but an allocation mechanism for the total mining revenue among all the miners. The profit maximization of a single miner does NOT change the total mining revenue of all the miners!
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:33:56

If that's the case, then the price would always stay the same.
When the price is *going up*, then that is a result of *demand exceeding supply* during this going up phase. Once it reaches equilibrium at a higher price, then demand equals supply again.
No need to get hung up on semantics here really, but whatever.
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:19:09


But this has nothing to do with the spam attacks. Instead that is just another arbitrary decision by the core devs, for no good reason.
Zero-fee transactions only have a small amount of blockspace allocated to them, and that space is configurable by miners. It gets filled according to the priority rating of all the available zero-fee transactions. Spam transaction never had enough priority to get into that space ever.

And rightly so. The whole "zero conf was never meant to be secure bla bla bla" is not helping these cases. These people don't care about technical details like that, they care about whether it works and how much time and money it costs them to keep it working. And so far, it has been working despite it "not being secure". Normal businesses are not getting double-spent, because contrary to what all the idiots on here are saying, it's not trivial to do so. But with opt-in RBF it is now absolutely trivial to rip-off businesses that are not aware of this or who did not update their payment system to handle these cases correctly. Again, an absolute fukcing mess for no goddamn benefit other than some academic masturbation about it being slightly more efficient thatn CPFP or FSS RBF. Fuck this bullshit, for real.

@_date: 2015-12-30 01:11:31
But that's an entirely different argument! Whether mining centralisation is encouraged as a result of orphaning risk is not the same question as whether fee revenue contributes to PoW security or not.
And PoW security here is the total amount of hashing expenses. The decentralization aspect can not be quantitatively factored in to this.

If the 2 factor implementation of Electrum is worth anything, then there should be no other solution than restoring from seed.


The security concern here is typing in the seed on your computer, which might be compromised by a trojan, a keylogger, etc. That's why you are using a 2 factor authentication method in the first place, to mitigate the risk of a compromised system. 


That's probably a good idea.
Before restoring from seed, create a new Electrum wallet and backup this wallet and the new seed. Write down a receiving address from this new wallet. Then restore your old wallet and send all your bitcoins to that new address from the new wallet. Finally load the backup file from the new wallet to get access to the bitcoins you just sent.

But I compltely agree with that. That's also what I meant by saying that the "orphaning cost" has an effect on the allocation or distribution of total fee revenue among miners. 
The thing is, I don't see how this would be different in a small block scenario: even when artificially raising fee level above the "gross orphan risk costs" (using your term here to avoid confusion, even though I absolutely don't agree with calling it a cost), there is still centralisation pressure from orphaning risk. Small blocks don't eliminate this pressure. 
~~Peter R.'s point was that transaction fees still contribute to PoW security even in a scenario where the gross orphan risk costs equals the total fee revenue.~~^* I agree with that and go even one step further by saying that 100% of the fee revenue contributes to PoW security, as there is no real cost of expended ressources associated to the orphan risk.
^* Actually, this is probably not a correct representation of Peter R.'s argument. But I'm too tired to keep thinking about this. My own point still stands.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:31:12


Increased demand for transactions that exceeds the supply provided at the momentary equilibrium between fee revenue and production cost, assuming that every additional transaction increases the orphaning risk more than the previous one, thus leading to higher fee requirements to offset this risk.

Generally I would agree with you that increasing the complexity of a working system should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. That's (among other reasons) why stupid patches like opt-in RBF should never be introduced. But in this case, I think the benefits and gained future flexibility justify the addtional complexity. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:31:48
Which in consquence means that 100% of fees contribute to PoW security, regardless of orphaning risks, right? Thus Gregory Maxwell's argument that orphaning risk "costs" reduce fee contribution to PoW couldn't be any more wrong.
Of course there's still the whole aspect of centralisation pressure due to high orphaning costs in relation to fee revenue, but that is an entirely different topic.

Once the transaction is included in a block (after the first confirmation), it will be included in every 	subsequent new block as well. So after the first confirmation, every other confirmation will take 10 minutes on average, regardless of the original transaction fee.

But that doesn't matter. Whether work is "wasted" on orphans, or expended without finding a block, is the same result: one miner gets the revenue, and all the other miners have wasted their work. But of course it's not wasted at all, it's what contributes to PoW security. It's only wasted from the perspective of a single miner's profit maximization.

As long as there is a block reward, no fees would ever be "needed", because the block reward is incentive enough for at least some miners to participate. The question is whether this incentive is enough to keep the network *secure*.
After all, even a single miner with a CPU is enough to keep the blocks coming, and the difficulty will adjust to keep them coming once every 10 minutes. There is nothing that says that we "need" [eight hundred thousand trillion hashes per second]( That is simply the result of the current incentive given by the block reward and the bitcoin price. Fees are not needed in this equation yet.
The reason why we do have fees despite a high block reward is a different one: it's an anti spam measure! The 1mb block limit is an anti spam measure, nothing else. So as long as there is no spam attack on the bitcoin network, fees should be irrelevant, as miners are mining for the block reward. Only when the network needs to prioritze transactions to prevent spam, then a "fee market" should temporarily develop.
Unfortunately the 1 mb limit can now no longer efficiently act as an anti spam measure, because legitimate transactions are regularly filling it up already. And therein lies the problem.
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:39:07
Can you explain how limiting the difficulty would help with decentralization?
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:23:56


The funny thing is, I'm mostly neutral regarding the whole block size debate, as there are valid arguments for both sides, and it's difficult to understand the bigger picture of such a decision with all the potential consequences of either scenario. 
But other, unrelated (?) decisions by the core devs made me become very critical of them: the bullheaded determination to implement RBF one way or another despite a lack of clear demand for it and against all concerns, or completely removing zero-fee transactions for absolutely no good reason at all, and their obsession with forcing a fee market now despite still having a huge block reward subsidy.
I just can no long in good faith believe that they only have the best interest of the Bitcoin ecosystem in mind. The unwillingness to compromise for a block size increase is just the icing on this cake.
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:41:33
I don't think this is Peter R.'s idea, at least not the way I understand it. What he has shown is that the individual orphan risk cost of each miner is what *creates* a fee market, even without an arbitrary block size limit. So miners basically create this market by providing supply for including transactions, at the marginal cost of the orphan risk of each transaction. What *sustains* this market is the external demand for transactions to get included in a block, which will necesseraly find an equilibrium with the aforementioned supply from miners.
Anyway, it looks to me like this discussion is going in a lot of different directions now, and I'll leave it to the experts here. All I really wanted to bring across is that Gregory Maxwell's argument that orphan risk cost reduces the contribution of tx fees to PoW security (measured by hashing power) makes no sense at all, assuming what I'm saying is correct.

@_date: 2015-12-30 01:03:26
Regarding your first paragraph: I can see how it could potentially play out like that. But it's based on a lot of assumptions (propagation costs getting low enough for orphan risk to become insignificant even compared to low fees). 


This is simply wrong! If all *my* blocks are orphaned, *my* revenue is zero, but all the revenue that *I* lost to orphaned blocks still exists, it's just not *my* personal revenue, but the revenue of a different miner. The total fee revenue is NOT LOST! That's the whole misconception people keep repeating here. It makes absolutely no sense. Please think about it. 
And since total fee revenue is never lost, but just allocated differently among miners, 100% of the fee revenue contributes to PoW security!
I can not make it any more clear than that.

In b4 "it was always up to the goodwill of a miner"... blablabla.
Yes, sure, but this goodwill was the default behaviour of the reference implementation. Any miner could go ahead and change that behaviour, but most of them were aware that this is a small price to pay for the increased utility of the network, and they knew that it made sense to follow this goodwill approach because a more valuable network will also inrease the ROI of their investment. Now the default behaviour is abandoning this goodwill, for absolutely no good reason at all.

But the cost associated with an increased orphaning risk isn't a real cost in the sense that it's expending ressources, it's merely an "opportunity cost" (using this term loosely here) of including transactions vs not including them. Transaction fees in this case are not used to pay any kind of external costs, but instead are purely used to offset said opportunity costs. Once the decision to include a transaction is made, the revenue from the fees can be allocated 100% to the actual mining operation, thus fully contributing to the POW security.
Or maybe I'm missing something here?
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:01:22
What the fuck are you talking about? It doesn't make things worse? What?

The cost of transactions? What? Did anyone hack your account?
The cost per transaction is absolutely marginal. The best estimate for a cost per transaction can be found in Peter R.'s paper, where he tries to calculate the orphaning risk of including a transaction in a block, and how that can be expressed as a cost because it means losing the block reward. 
But this is not an inherent cost of a transaction, that's simply a result of an increased orphaning risk, which is costly ONLY because there is such a big mining reward.
If that's the level of understanding of these topics for people as involved as you are, then I am not surprised about the current mess to be honest. Sorry to say this but... seriously.

@_date: 2016-01-14 18:22:15


Not true at all. There are direct and indirect benefits of running a full node. For example anyone who is processing payments or other kinds of blockchain transactions doesn't have to rely on a thrid party if they run their own node. And of course running a full node makes perfect rational sense for anyone who is financially invested in the health of the Bitcoin network in any way. This isn't a tragedy of the commons scenario, instead it's a scenario where the people with the biggest investment have the biggest incentive to contribute.


Here's an alternative interpretation: assuming a bigger blocksize is ultimately necessary for Bitcoin's utility to keep increasing, then not raising the blocksize would limit the incentives to contribute to the network to the status quo. By raising the blocksize and allowing more use cases to develop and prosper, more people will be incentiviced to participate and invest in this ecosystem, and will thus have a reason to contribute and keep it healthy, i.e. by running a node.


How much "better" would a network with hundreds of thousands of nodes really be compared to a network with let's say 5000 nodes? Does this difference justify a severe limit on the block size?
Regarding your potential solution: that likely won't work, because it's relatively easy to set up fake nodes that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones.

Let's say I own bitcoins on address A. I now send them to address B, and try to double spend them to address C. On the new chain, this double spend attempt fails and the transaction to address B gets mined. On the old chain, the double spend is successful, and the transaction to address C gets mined. I now own the same amount of bitcoins in two different addresses on the two chains, which are decoupled in the sense that they can be spent on one chain without affecting the ones on the other chain.
This selective double spend scenario is not even that unlikely, because the new chain will likely have quicker confirmation times than the old chain (larger blocks, higher and increasing hashrate vs low and decreasing hashrate on the old chain, better connected nodes, etc.).

Well, I'm very sure that implementing FSS-RBF in a wallet would be trivial. Me not being a wallet coder doesn't change that.


I'm sorry but this couldn't be more incorrect: 
Merging inputs **reduces** privacy. There's even something called "merge avoidance" that is used by some wallets for exactly this privacy reason. So it's the exact opposite of what you're saying!
And the only reason for not leaving small inputs around is to avoid a situation where a transaction becomes too large due to too many small inputs, so instead this can be "spread out" over many transaction. Whether wallets are actually actively doing this, I don't even know. And if they do, it's again a trivial change to revert this in favor of FSS-RBF.

Someone could construct a double spend transaction in such a way that it gets mined on one chain, but not on the other, thus "decoupling" his coins on the two chains. This someone could then spend them with a merchant who is still accepting old chain bitcoins, which would result in that merchant losing money, assuming the old chain coins are worth less than they think that they are.

No, you're not wrong. The payment terminal can't just "return" the money, it can only refuse to accept it unless it's confirmed.
It's also not as simple as saying "well then the payer has to just transmit an RBF transaction to send it to himself again", because there is no guarantee that the second transaction will be honored by a miner instead of the first one, as the whole opt-in RBF thing is completely non-enforcable.
The result of this messy situation is that, if a customer accidentally opts in for RBF when making a payment to someone who doesn't accept RBF payments, then they're still forced to wait for confirmation, either of the initial transaction or the attempted RBF transaction.
Complete fucking lose-lose bullshit.

I disagree. Now what? Repeating something doesn't make it true. This whole decentralization argument is the whole reason why people have settled for a minimal increase of the blocksize to 2MB instead of the 20MB or 8MB from the first proposals.

    Fee revenue = Number of transaction * Average transaction fee * Price
So to support a mining network that provides an equal amount of security, the increase in these three factors combined has to make up for the loss in block reward.
Theoretically, it's even possible to have the same revenue with a 1MB block, assuming the average transaction fees and the price increase enough. The question is whether bitcoin could ever become so valuable and be in such high demand while keeping such a small block size. 
The problem here is that an increase in price would also require an equal increase in security provided by the network, so the price factor would cancel itself out more or less in this equation. Bummer.
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:55:54
The problem here is that one of the outputs is only 465 satoshis, which is below the so-called "dust limit" for outputs, making this a non-standard transaction, which means most nodes won't relay it, and most miners won't mine it.

@_date: 2016-01-21 19:47:16
Okay, lets make this very simple: if the average amount of transactions per block is &gt;1MB, then the number of transactions that will never get confirmed increases over time. Now, you can start trying to outbid everyone else, but everyone you successfully outbid will now have their transaction not get confirmed. And of course other people will not sit idle, and will try to outbid your own transactions. So, good luck trying to be among the small VIP group who gets to use Bitcoin. Most people will simply not bother and use something else instead that's easier, more reliable and cheaper.

A spam attack only hurts users if it forces them to increase the fees they need to pay. Filling up a block with low fee transactions accomplishes nothing. Therefore, filling up 2MB with inexpensive spam is irrelevant. But filling up an already almost full 1MB with high fee transactions is extremely cheap for an attacker.

No, that's not how a fork works. You can't independently buy and sell old and new coins: they're the same bitcoins on two different chains, and they remain the same bitcoins on two different chains, except for transactions that include newly mined bitcoins or bitcoins that have been double spent on only one chain. Your whole conspiratard premise is faulty, because you don't understand how a fork works.
@_date: 2016-01-05 13:55:51


Actually, fees really shouldn't be an issue while the block reward is still as huge as it is today. Fees are only an allocation mechanism for limited block space, and the block space was originally being limited to avert spam attacks. So fees should only play a role during a spam attack, not during "normal operation". But, alas, somehow the block space limit has become something completely different today.

What do you mean? Splitting a single utxo into many would be a very simple functionality. Sorry for repating myself, but it's absolutely trivial.

Yes, that's why I said before that *a wallet could simply create an initial transaction with a dozen outputs that can be used for FSS-RBF in the future*, to solve this non-problem.

This attack worked so well because the attacker only had to fill the small remaining blockspace that is left after all the legitimate transactions filled up the biggest part of a block already. And after that, ever additional transaction starts clogging up the network. These kinds of attacks will become easier to pull off and their effects only get worse the closer we get to full blocks.

@_date: 2016-01-05 17:26:19


But based on what? Like I said, whether a fee was sufficiently high or too low is only evident *after the fact*. Sure, estimates could be made based on mempool, but that would require either running a full-node, or constantly polling a third party full node. Both are not practical options for the majority of users.
And even then, estimates based on mempool will be extremely unreliable, as the mempool is not a homogenous thing, but an individual snapshot per node, and it does not have to correspond with that a miner sees.


It's really not. And even if it was, it only represents one side of the coin, as the miner's preferences are still entirely hidden from the user.
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:31:13
Did you know that you now also have to constantly monitor the mempool status of your transaction, to make sure that it didn't suddenly get dropped due to the 300mb limit for nodes that has been added in 0.12? That limit is obviously very necessary, because with an ever increasing backlog of transactions that will never get confirmed, nodes would crash otherwise. Welcome to Bitcoin Core!
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:15:48


You seem to have some kind of misconception here: HD wallets are not more or less likely to have spare inputs. That is entirely dependant on the usage pattern of the user.
Regarding the rest of your arguments, I believe I've made my points as well as I could.


Hmm? There already is a working FSS-RBF implementation. F2Pool is even using it afaik.
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:08:32
Of course. Once blocks are consistenly full, some of the demand will simply leave. That's how a market works: price goes up, demand goes down, new equilibrium is found. 
Regardless of whether you think most of the transactions are "spam" or whatever for some strange reason, pushing usage down by forcing out demand will reduce Bitcoin's utility and its network effect. If that's good for Bitcoin at this critical stage of adoption is highly questionable.
And the problem is that once demand *consistently* exceeds 1MB, just waiting a little bit longer won't work anymore: transactions that don't make the cut will not confirm indefinitely, because new demand will constantly keep them out. So the only option is to increase fees, trying to outbid this other demand. But that simply means someone else's transaction will now not confirm indefinitely. Etc.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:03:31
I don't need to write anything up. You make no sense, that's your problem.


Whether you use a single input or merge different inputs that have been split from this single input has the same privacy implications.
Look, nobody said FSS-RBF is more efficient thatn opt-in RBF, but it's good enough for the few cases where it can be useful. There is no need and no demand for something overly complex that comes with averse effects such as opt-in RBF, when there is FSS-RBF and CPFP readily available now.

Okay. But it wouldn't have to futily try if there wasn't an artificially created "fee market" based on artificially created block space limitations in the first place. Let miners dictate fees based on their transaction costs and orphaning risks, and the resulting market will be very very manageable, without making things overly complex with opt-in RBF and other poorly thought-out workarounds.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:29:41
Why would this be a problem? A wallet either has the necessary spare input, in which case it can offer the user to FSS-RBF the transaction, or it doesn't have the spare input, in which case that option will be grayed out or whatever.
Again, this has nothing to do with HD wallets.

I haven't even considered that. One more reason to not try and enforce any kind of RBF before the bitcoin ecosystem is ready for it. 
And yes, miners and nodes can implement RBF regardless of what Core is doing. But they could have done that a long time ago already, and yet they didn't, because they are interested in a healthy and valuable ecosystem and not jeopardizing their investment for a few millibits more fees.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:48:40
But taxing the existing holders instead of taxing the people making transactions is only necessary while the usage is still low (during the bootstrapping phase of the network), and transactions alone could not support mining security. Once usage levels grow enough this subsidy from holders becomes unnecessary. Of course that implies that bitcoin will actually be widely used, and not just be seen as a passive investment like digital gold.
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:04:12

As I explained before, the amount of breathing room doesn't really matter. What matters is that blocks aren't full. Whether they're 20% full, 50% full or 80% full, the user experience will be the same.
So if we're now facing a scenario where blocks could start to get consistenly full, and that would cause a significant disruption in user experience and perceived utility, then even adding a little bit more headroom would be sufficient until better scaling options are implemented. Not doing so is very reckless behaviour in my opinion.

That's about the stupidest thing I've read today. What does that even mean? Miners are in this to make money, and they only make money if the bitcoins they mine have value. The value of a bitcoin comes from its utility and security, and both are provided by the miners. Why should miners start "misbehaving" and killing their investment for no reason? If miners make a decision as a majority, then there must be good reasons for this decision, because they want to make sure that Bitcoin keeps its utility value and its security, so they can keep making money.

Okay, at least you can admit that you're not exactly sure what you've been talking about. I'm just getting really annoyed by people repeating false hyperbole like "omg bitcoin is not anonymous at all and everyone will be tracked!".
What you're probably remembering is an issue with some wallets not randomizing their output order, and thus making it possible to identify the change output based on its order. I think most wallets have fixed this by now. And even if it's still an issue with some, it's really a huge stretch to say that this allows identification of a user based on a single known transaction. It's just not the case. All it does is make it easier to guess which is the change output, IF you know that a transaction has been made with a certain wallet, and IF that wallet does not properly randomize the output order. That's all there is to it.

Fees will stay low until the avg demand exceeds 1MB. It doesn't matter much if half the block is empty when you make a transaction, or if it's 9/10 full: it just means that your transaction still fits into the block regardless.
Once demand consistenly exceeds 1MB that's when the fun startst! Now you raise your fee to outbid some other shmuck's transaction, who will then also raise his fee, etc etc. Welcome to the bidding war!

That's the point! With FSS-RBF, the whole opt-in approach becomes entirely unnecessary. A transaction will either get FSS-RBFd, or it won't, depending on what the user does (and also depending on whether his wallet has the spare input that is needed). There are no averse effects of FSS-RBF that need to be poorly worked around by making it an opt-in option.


No, why would a HD wallet do that if it's not necessary? Unless it's extremely poorly coded that is.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:41:14
I guess that could be made a wallet setting, where the preference for keeping a number of available free inputs can be set?
Yes, I know your expectation is that wallets engage in constant bidding wars against each other, doing dozens or even hundreds of RBF transaction before it finally gets included. That's not something FSS-RBF can do. But I also don't think it's something that makes any kind of sense, neither from an economical perspective nor from a usability standpoint.
For the few cases where people get their transaction stuck or whatever due to a mistake (as most wallets already handle fee estimates fairly well by now), FSS-RBF is perfectly fine.

The point is that the anti-spam measure of increasing fees is extremely cheap for an attacker to trigger when the blocks are almost full already: if an attacker has to fill up 100kb on average per block with spam to have an effect on fees, then an additional 1MB of blockspace would make this attack 10 times more expensive already.

Hashing power is just a product of the mining revenue, and mining revenue is the sum of the block reward and the fee revenue. So assuming the block reward is gone, then hashing power will become the product of fee revenue.
The last paragraph is talking about the correlation between bitcoin price and the necessary security provided by the network to justify that price: the more value is stored and transacted in bitcoins, the higher the incentive for an adversary to attack it. What that means is that an increase in price can not make up for the lost block reward, because the higher price would require an increase in hashing power to make up for itself already.

Okay, let me explain it differently:
The fee Y that is necessary to pay to get included in a block can be abstracted as Y = (the lowest of the total amount of X highest fee transactions), where X is defined by the block size limit.
Now, if you allow users who guessed below Y to increase their guess instead of waiting it out, then the next Y will be higher than it would have been if these users hadn't raised their fees. This will prompt other users to anticipate such a raise and start making higher initial guesses, again resulting in a higher Y. And so forth.
Your argument is that a competitive fee market allows for a lower initial Y, because people can attempt low-balling with the option to participate in the bidding war if their low-balling didn't work. Sure, maybe. But the effect I described above will quickly result in the exact opposite, where it becomes necessary to guess higher in anticipation of other people raising their fees.
To respond to your USD EUR example: this is a completely different situation because it is a (mostly) transaparent market, with bids and offers visible in the order books. There is no guessing or anticipating necessary here when trying to get a market order filled.

No. Like I already tried to explain twice now: doing a double spend that is only successful on one of the two chains will decouple these bitcoins, thus making a later transaction done with them on one chain invalid on the other.

We don't. But that number aligns (at least intuitively) pretty well with current incentives: there's some incentive to run a full node, but there's basically no incentive to run a fake node. A number of 5000+ nodes doesn't seem to contradict this.

And who gets to decide which transactions are economically relevant? Oh that's right, the fee market, forced by an arbitrary limit. And everyone who is not economically relevant enough will have to go elsewhere, which they will. Definitely good for Bitcoin.

There is also no proof that a significant amount of transactions are "fairly worthless non-economic activity". But sure, let's make you the judge of this.
Regardless of all of this, it's limiting Bitcoin's utility, and reduced usage will also reduce its network effects. And all this during one of the most critical phases of Bitcoin's adoption. What could possibly go wrong.
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:57:52
Yes. They're considerably close to being full though. But from a fee perspective, it doesn't make much of a difference if they're only half full or almost full, as long as they're not full, and that there will be a tipping point where that's going to change very abruptly!

It doesn't change the nature of the problem: every transaction creates at least one new and unknown pseudonym, which can be assigned with a certain probability to one or many possibly known identity. It doesn't matter whether you cluster large amounts of transactions or not, the principle of a constantly increasing pseudonymity set still applies. (The only exception to this is reusing addresses of course, which has been discouraged for a long time now.)
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:45:16

The solution is easy: stop spamming the blockchain with your transactions!
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:02:51
Uh yeah, that's under the assumption of a price elastic supply. This is not the case with a fixed supply limit of 1MB. The only price elasticity left is in the demand curve. Thus my statement is perfectly valid, and your nitpicking completely pointless.

According to [this]( site, there were 17,000 licensed taxis in London in 1996. Let's assume there's 20,000 taxis in London today, and that each one has one paying customer per hour.

Could you at least point me to a discussion about this "issue"?
And "coin selection" has nothing to do with change addresses. Merge avoidance in wallets is definitely a privacy relevant topic, as it's one way to reduce the otherwise growing pseudonymity set. But again, this has absolutely nothing to do with your above claim, which I still believe to be complete bs.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:10:48
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:33:11


Here is where I disagree. The identity attached to a single bitcoin transaction will only allow for a probabilistic analysis of its past and future. If I send you some bitcoins now, you can go back and see where these have been coming from, and you can make a guess with a certain probability of being true whether these were also my transactions or not. 
Same example: I send you some bitcoins, and my identity is somehow attached to this transaction. Now you send these bitcoins to someone else, who will then look back in the blockchain to see where these came from, and will find our transaction with my identitiy attached to it. Should that person now have reason to believe that you are me?
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:22:41
Staying alive by cutting out the heart. Sure why not.
Changing the PoW algorithm would create an actual altcoin that starts off with pretty much no mining security. To think that such a spin-off of Bitcoin wouldn't get attack is more than naive. It would be completely doomed.

Apparently it's not a problem, because all transactions are just spam except your own and Lukejr's.
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:30:18
For most transactions it doesn't really matter that much to be in the next block. So people will rather opt to wait a bit longer to sit out temporary spikes in demand than try and outbid the market by guessing fees. There's also no RBF yet, so bidding up a transaction is not easy, but that will apparantly change soon. That's when anyone can bid up after their transaction didn't confirm.
And the marginal cost of a transaction for nodes and miners is very low. Probably barely measurable in cents, and definitely not a justification for higher fees. The network right now is running on the block reward subsidy, as it was intended. This is the whole point of the bootstrapping phase: provide incentives for securing the network regardless of transaction volume.
This bootstrapping phase is still supposed to be the main driver behind Bitcoin's adoption (heck, we only ever had one single halving!), but now suddenly people are acting like fees are necessary to keep miners interested or something. It's absurd really.

It's definitely possible to construct a scenario where a hard fork could lead to someone losing money for being ignorant of the change. But that is not what that statement conveys to the average reader, which makes it FUD. And the authors are no doubt aware of this, which makes it just sad.
@_date: 2016-01-26 00:23:01


That's probably correct. But it's worth noting that every *bitcoin address* has on average 2^(256-160) = 2^96 matching private keys. That's because a bitcoin address is generated from a 160-bit hash of its public key.
Not that this is in any way relevant to OP's question though.
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:29:33


You absolutely can't be serious! 
First of all, users will only know if the fee was too low *after the fact*, once their transaction didn't get included. That's when they raise their fee to get a better chance for the next block, again *guessing a higher fee upfront*, and at the same time forcing others to also make higher guesses upfront.
So not only does it not solve the problem of having to guess the fee upfront, it will make it necessary to guess higher because others will be increasing their low guesses, continuously raising the bar.




What kind of argument is that? It's not a problem while the block reward is high in realtion to fees, which will likely be the case for a long time to come.


Those are NOT the use cases I am talking about, and you know it. Try to stay honest at least.

It solves the capacity problem by letting you outbid other transactions by raising your fee as many times as you like, even after sending the transaction. This way, everyone who is not willing to pay as much as the highest bidders will go away and use something else. [Isn't that awesome?](

You could manually push the transaction to the bitcoin network using one of the available web APIs (there is no risk in doing this, as the transaction can not be modified by the website).
To do this open the console in your Bitcoin Core client, then type
    getrawtransaction 090a559af27550f2c990223adf978e254e2c53442298ea95e240191dd8acf4d7

I assume you intended this to be read as an argument against a block size increase, because you see that as the potentially "breaking change". In reality however, increasing the block size means keeping the status quo of having a block size capacity that outweighs demand. Not increasing the block size would be the potentially breaking change here, because it would drastically alter the economies of transacting in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-05 12:57:46

And as a side note: zero fee transactions are planned to be completely deprecated in an upcoming release of Core.

The public key is derived from the private key using the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm. The public key is then hashed twice, first using SHA-256 then RIPEMD-160, to create the basis for the bitcoin address.

It doesn't matter what you label it.
@_date: 2016-01-28 00:13:53
Keep in mind that the OP_RETURN data adds to the size of the transaction too, so at the same fee rate, you'd still have to pay more.
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:19:14
Blocks are full when transactions with a default fee (as defined by minrelaytxfee in nodes) never confirm, because new transactions consistenly take up all the free space in blocks. That's when blocks are full in the sense that people perceive them as full, and are forced to start bidding for block space. 
Right now, there are phases where the backlog grows a little, followed by phases where the backlog gets cleared again. And most of that backlog is atually low priority transactions that intentionally pay a low fee, because they can afford to wait for the phases where the backlog gets cleared.

No it doesn't. RBF only allows users to compete in bidding wars for fees more efficiently, making the limited block space more expensive for everyone in the end.
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:00:57
Thank you. I completely agree with that notion, but it's difficult to convince people of it because of their perceived dissonance between the two different camps on forums such as reddit. But in the end, rational self-interest will prevail over ideologies and egos.
I see you submitted this link 5 months ago. Maybe it would be a good time to submit it again? :)
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:55:24
True. But now imagine things like opt-in RBF, and suddenly this selective double spending becomes almost trivial.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:06:32
The incentive for miners to participate in securing the network right now is given by the huge mining reward. Fees in comparison are still irrelevant, and only necessary to prioritize transactions when the capacity limit is reached, to discourage spam transactions. But when that same limit is limiting legitimate transactions, then an anti-spam measure gets turned into an anti-adoption measure.
@_date: 2016-01-04 00:39:10


That's because that whole premise is idiotic. In the end, almost every bitcoin transaction is part of a long chain (excluding block reward coinbase transactions).
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:55:10
Stop making no sense.
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:28:45
Yeah, that's why you need to decouple them in such a way that a transaction gets mined on one chain but not on the other, which could be done by doing a double spend that is successful only on one chain.

More likely because nobody really wants it that much to bother, especially when apparently core devs want to go an entirely different direction anyway for some reason. So why would any wallet dev bother with it now?


I don't deny that it *can* be worse in some cases. But then that's simply the trade-off for replacing a transaction a user has to make. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 13:17:28

Who is talking about the 1st block here? If blocks are consistently full, then the leftover transactions will never get into a block.

@_date: 2016-01-28 15:06:19
Fair enough. My position is that it's more likely to have a significant impact on things than not, and that a moderate increase in blocksize is the more reasonable alternative.
By letting blocks get consistently full, you're basically advocating to do an experiment on the whole Bitcoin ecosystem that has never been done before: *what happens when blocks are full and demand exceeds supply?*
I'd rather not do these kinds of experiments during a fairly critical stage of Bitcoin's adoption, but that's just me. But maybe that's because I'm not affected by all the irrational fearmongering around hard forks that much.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:14:19


Once the economic incentives and the network effects of keeping Bitcoin the dominant currency become strong enough, then a radical change like switching to a completely "new paradigm" will become very very unlikely to happen. Instead there will be incremental changes and fixes. So it's either now or never if you're hoping for something radically different.
Just look at the current system of fiat money: everyone knows it's highly inefficient, comes with a wide array of systemic risks and likely won't be sustainable for much longer. And yet, the incentives are there to just keep it going, applying quick fixes like QE and negative interest rates to avoid the new paradigm like the plague.
@_date: 2016-01-05 13:25:27


You know what else is "not safe"? Driving on the highway. And yet millions of people do it every day, because the risk is worth the reward.
Maybe we should just force everyone to take the train instead, because let's face it, in theory, that would be much better for everyone. 
Anyway, I'm kinda done with this discussion for today, as it's as pointless as opt-in RBF itself.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:47:14
A wallet could simply create an initial transaction with a dozen outputs that can be used for FSS-RBF in the future. Not that I think this is necessary, because the demand for any kind of RBF is extremely low, but it would again be trivial to deal with it from a wallet implementation standpoint.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:54:53
There's a much simpler way to explain the effect RBF has on the double spending problem: right now, most users simply wouldn't even know where to start to even attempt a double spend. With RBF, even a little child can click on the button that lets them send the bitcoins somewhere else.
Yes yes.. opt-in! Wallets should warn users or not display funds! Blah blah. Most users won't know what RBF is and how it works, and they don't care. All they want is send and receive money, just as Paypal or Venmo lets them do. Nobody wants to figure out what this strange warning message means, or why they can't see the bitcoins someone just sent them in their wallet.

It does not allow for lower fees. All it does it allow for low-balling, then engaging in a bid war for block space. The end result of this will be **higher fees** for everyone.
Besides, this is not an argument for full RBF vs FSS RBF.


Not an argument for full RBF vs FSS RBF.


Strawman argument. Miners could have implemented any kind of RBF a long time ago. They did not do that, because they are interested in a healthy and valuable ecosystem. They are not interested in jeopardizing their investment for a few millibits of additional fees. These arguments will become relevant once the block reward becomes too low to guarantee enough miner involvement. This is not now.


Lol. All it does is **force** everyone to upgrade their systems. What you're really saying here is that zero-conf should be eliminated, and RBF does that, once ignoring the reality of the real world use cases that are HAPPENING NOW.

This is only true in a competitive environment.

@_date: 2016-01-21 13:25:39
Yes sure. But you're missing the point here: the bidding war will send a price signal to users that transactions are more expensive now, and that will reduce demand below 1MB again. All the rest will go use something else again. Problem solved.
@_date: 2016-01-14 14:20:31

Tracking identities via bitcoin transactions is a probabilistic approach: after every transaction, the confidence of knowing "who" owns which part of that transaction diminishes. All you can do is assign pseudonymous transactions to probabilities of who could be behind it. After a while, the only thing you're able to say with some confidence, is that at some point in the past, it appears that XY has bought these bitcoins. It doesn't say anything about the current owner. And even after only a single transaction, you can no longer know if I still own these bitcoins or not. You can guess, sure. But what about 10 transactions later? 100 transactions later? Now you're basically just saying there's a tiny chance that these transactions could maybe still be made by me. Useless.
That is, IF you can even get the information of who bought those bitcoins and where, which would require you to a) figure out what service sold those bitcoins, which is not visible just from looking at the transaction and b) get that service to reveal their records and the identity of their customers.
And that is even ignoring the fact that it's quite simple to buy bitcoins anonymously: Localbitcoins from sellers for cash, or even bitcoin ATM's that take cash and don't require ID. In this case, you can track all you want, there's no identity to be found. This is the key point of the term "pseudonymity". The decision to attach an identity to the pseudonym is always an optional one. Don't want to do that? Don't use services that force you to. It's really simple. 
For the paranoid, there's also mixers, tumblers and things like which will make tracking even more futile than it already is.
And if you're still not conviced: please tell me where all the stolen/lost/whatever bitcoins from MtGox are, if tracking is so easy. Oh you can't? And nobody else seems to be able to either? Okay then.

From my other reply, because you like to focus so much on this fallacy:
First of all, users will only know if the fee was too low after the fact, once their transaction didn't get included. That's when they raise their fee to get a better chance for the next block, again guessing a higher fee upfront, and at the same time forcing others to also make higher guesses upfront.
So not only does it not solve the problem of having to guess the fee upfront, it will make it necessary to guess higher because others will be increasing their low guesses, continuously raising the bar.

@_date: 2016-01-05 12:57:01
Yes, in an ideal situation. In the real world, people use things like printed out QR codes in person, they use custom implementations for bitcoin payments on their webshops which don't support opt-in RBF and need to be updated to do so, which requires a) awareness of the issue and b) time and money to make it compatible. 
And all this for what exactly again?
Regarding your edit:


I think this sums it up nicely. RBF is a good idea in theory, but it's a complete mess in the current environment of people relying on zero-fee tx more often than not, payment systems not being ready for it, and there not being any real demand for it in the first place.
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:11:24
What? No! Right now, if someone pays a too low amount of fees to get included in the next block, they simply wait instead of increasing their fees. With RBF, they will increase their fees, starting a bidding war by forcing others to also increase their fees.

I wait until it confirms.
Unfortunately I have to go off in a few minutes, so I'll have to link you to an old comment of mine, which I think sums up my thoughts on this pretty well:
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:26:09
* Because it forces everyone to change their bitcoin implementation to correctly handle opt-in RBF transactions. This includes all wallets and payment processors, but also a lot of smaller custom implementations. They now all have to spend time and money to fix something that wasn't broken before, without getting any kind of benefit from it.
* Anyone who accepts zero conf transactions and is not aware of this change will be at a risk of getting scammed. Not everyone is reading this subreddit, some people just accept bitcoin, and that's it. Now suddenly the rules of the game change in a way that could cause them to lose money. I bet that will inspire confidence in this currency.
* Anyone who accepted zero conf transactions before is now incentivized to no longer do so, because of the trouble that would be caused by someone sending an opt-in RBF transaction despite those not being accepted. In such a case the merchant would have to explain to the customer why his transaction didn't work instantly as expected and why he has to wait for confirmations now. This again generates unnecessary confusion and costs without any benefit. To avoid these overhead support costs, a lot of merchants will simply stop accepting zero conf transactions.
* It adds unnecessary complexity in general: anytime someone is introduced to Bitcoin, they now get confronted with this whole confusing opt-in RBF deal, making it even harder for people to adopt this new technology.
* It creates a false sense of security for non RBF zero conf transactions: if you explain to a user that RBF means they can change their transaction after sending, they will assume that a non-RBF transaction is final. This only makes the potential double spending scenario for zero conf transactions worse than it already is.
And all of this for a feature that nobody really asked for, and that's only good for a few edge cases, or to deal with a congested blockchain caused by the reckless opposition to a moderate and immediate scaling measure.

No shit sherlock. But at that point, potential for further growth is effectively 0. Zero. And people will suddenly be forced to engage in fee wars to get their transactions confirmed. Not to get them confirmed in the next block, but to get them confirmed at all. 
So you're advocating a situation where further growth and adoption is completely stinted, and the usability for the remaining users is significantly diminished. And you want to let it come to such a situation during an arguably critical phase of Bitcoin's adoption. 


Then why did we have a 1MB limit years ago when the average block size was way below that? Didn't that unnecessarily allow spammers to fill full 1MB blocks? Why didn't Satoshi set the limit to something more reasonable at the time, like maybe 200kb? 
I'll tell you why: because preventing spam is less important than allowing growth. Good thing Satoshi was a lot smarter than you, so he understood that. Or else we might still be stuck with 200kb blocks.
The 1MB limit was completely arbitrary. The only criteria for chosing it was that it allowed for enough growth before it becomes a problem. That criteria is no longer met, hence the need for an appropriate increase.
Anyway, I'm not even sure if you're not trolling me at this point.
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:06:30

@_date: 2016-02-01 20:36:05
That's not even what economic majority means: the economic majority is defined by the larger and more valuable ecosystem behind them. That's also why exchanges and merchants have more weight in all of this than they seem to realize, because they provide the biggest part of bitcoin's utility value right now.

I don't know. All I know is that miners have no incentive to undermine the utility of bitcoin just to squeeze out a few millibits more, as long as the market value of the block reward subsidy is what pays their bills. And that's why miners have not made RBF a thing in all the 7 years of Bitcoin's existence, even though they could have.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:38:30
Anyone who doesn't want to take any risk will only accept bitcoins that are not tainted (and therefore valid on both chains) until the forking situation is resolved.
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:44:44
None of my assumptions hinge on stupidty or laziness, but on a lack of awareness and overhead costs. I have no idea why you'd want to call people who don't follow every development in Bitcoin space closely stupid, or why you refer to people who don't like unnecessary costs as lazy. 


If you step out of your ivory tower for a second, you'd notice that zero conf works perfectly fine in normal every day use cases. People who are'nt Peter Todd don't know where to start to even attempt a double spend, and they certainly can't be bothered to figure it out just so they can go and steal a dollar here or there. Zero conf works, that's a fact. Pretending that it doesn't, just because there's a certain risk associated with it is simply disingenuous!


Why? RBF adds absolutely nothing to the awareness of zero conf security. Nothing at all. In fact it does the opposite as I tried to explain under my last bullet point.

@_date: 2016-02-02 20:35:11
That's a valid point to some extent, but it's taken out of context.
That thread was talking about "selling coins on one chain of the fork but not the other" or something like that. My reply to this was that there won't be two different markets, because during the (presumably fairly short) time it takes for the fork to get resolved onto a single chain, accepting only coins that haven't been "tainted" by its owner becomes the prudent option. This is what exchanges and payment processors could easily do, making tainted coins become worthless during that period of time, leaving their holder unable to spend them at all. [That's why there won't be two markets.](
It's true that users who are unaware of the fork are at a risk of getting scammed in such a way during the time it takes for the fork to get resolved. But again, this takes both a knowledgeable attacker, as it's not as simple as pressing the RBF button, as well as someone who is unaware of the forking situation. I'm pretty sure if a fork happens there will be a lot of flashy news articles about it. Something that certainly isn't true for something like opt-in RBF.
It will also only be a very temporary problem, if it even comes to that. The more likely outcome is that the minority chain becomes unusable within hours, as all miners have a monetary incentive to switch to the majority chain as quickly as possible.
Apples and oranges.
Edit: One more point to add to this is that Bitcoin Core has an alert system that can be used to inform its users of the forking situation.

Who would have thought that it would be such a nice round number too? The universe is truly lining up on this one!

@_date: 2016-02-02 20:24:26


As Peter Todd already commented, that tool has existed for a long time now. Nobody cared. 
The problem with attempted double spends is that they rarely work. Someone would need a lot of criminal energy to keep doing that for the chance to steal a few dollars maybe. But with opt-in RBF, this becomes as easy as pressing a button when the other party is unaware of it. Even a little child can do it with near 100% success. It's a completely different thing.
Either way, no matter how secure or insecure you think zero conf transactions are, opt-in RBF does not improve the situation in any way. All it does is add an even easier attack vector against people who are unaware of it. Nothing about normal zero conf transactions improves because of that, they only become less useful because of the overhead caused by confusing customers, as explained in my first reply.
I absolutely do not understand why some people feel the need to defend this so much, and dismiss every reasonable concern by hand waving some arguments about "zero conf is insecure". This doesn't even have anything to do with it to be honest. 
All my arguments I made in my first reply still stand. RBF is detrimental to Bitcoin's adoption process by imposing unnecessary complexity on everyone. And pretty much nobody wants it or has a need for it.
@_date: 2016-02-02 13:28:12

Bullshit. Coins are valid on both chains unless the user takes action to change this. So not accepting bitcoin from users who "tainted" their coins is perfectly reasonable, and anyone will probably do it. But have fun ignoring all this while repeating your Imma-sell-my-one-chain-coins crap ad infintum.
@_date: 2016-02-10 13:45:06


Says who? Once transactions with "normal" fees don't confirm anymore, people will be forced to engage in bidding wars. It's difficult to tell how exactly that will play out, but it's safe to assume that it won't just slowly ebb in and out. What will flow out is people who decide that this is not something they want to continue to use though. 


No, I suggest making more room for growth and adoption without alienating users with fee wars and driving them away. If you consider everyone but yourself using bitcoin as a spammer, then I guess that's fair enough. Maybe you, luke-jr and nullc should make your own little blockchain, completely free of any spam. Wouldn't that be nice?
@_date: 2016-02-10 13:22:22


[Fees will stay low until the average demand exceeds 1MB.]( That's why referring to fees while saying "nothing to see here, everything's fine" makes no sense. It will only become obvious once it's too late and the tipping point has been reached.


No it's not. What was intended to be (a fairly randomly chosen) block size cap to limit the effect of spam attacks has now become a limiting factor for regular adoption. The fact that, on average, that limit is still not exceeded by "bona fide" transactions is absolutely irrelevant to the question whether that limit is still sufficient for the near future.

I think you're mixing some things up here: this patch does is no way solve the double spending problem, it only makes it worse! It basically introduces so much uncertainty that zero-conf transactions are not viable any longer, regardless of the situation.
And the opt-in part is the biggest joke of all: it creates a huge mess where both parties have to negotiate beforehand whether RBF is acceptable or not, which complicates everything unnecessarily. And if that negotiation fails, then it leads to all sorts of situations where payments get rejected, and the payee or the payer doesn't know why etc. It's absolutely fucking stupid and I can't believe I'm even reading this thread right now.

Not even that. Those can actually be sent with 0 fees if you're not in a hurry to get them confirmed.
But 5 sat/byte is usually sufficient to get the transaction confirmed reasonably fast. And with a basic transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs being about 230 bytes, that amounts to 1150 satoshis for the fee, which is less than half a cent.
I really don't understand the fixation with getting every transaction included right in the next block, most of the time that isn't necessary at all.

This is a stupid argument. Up until now, double spending has required both a lot of knowledge and effort, with an uncertain outcome. Success was not guaranteed. And the ways to make one transaction become less likely to be mined than the other could easily be detected.
And that's why it wasn't a problem: it just isn't worth it to go through all of this for a chance to scam someone for a dollar or two. Because with larger amounts, people are already relying on confirmations, as it should be.
But with this patch, double spending is now suddenly a feature. It's easy to do and almost guaranteed to succeed. It becomes effortless to scam even for a few cents, so it will be done.

Let's talk about this consensus then. Which is why he made this thread. How about you calm down instead?
@_date: 2015-10-28 09:36:50
Of course. Because before burning the bitcoins, the alarm clock owner has a functioning bitcoin alarm clock. That means he has demand for the bitcoins that make it function. If he does not rebuy the bitcoins, then he reduces demand, because he apparently doesn't want to have a functioning bitcoin alarm clock anymore.
So by burning the bitcoins, he reduces supply, and by not rebuying them, he reduces demand. But if his demand stays the same, and he still wants to get the same utility out of his bitcoin alarm clock, then he has to rebuy from a now reduced pool of supply.
@_date: 2015-11-28 10:12:11
Exactly. Zero conf works in certain cases, and where it doesn't work, everyone can already rely on confirmations. Nobody is forced to accept zero conf transactions, but at least now people have the option to do so if the risk profile of the situation allows for it. This patch only makes the situation worse for everyone.

By the way, this exact malleability issue is what Mark Karpeles blamed for the missing MtGox bitcoins, by claiming that it was used to fool their internal wallet. So it has been known for quite a long time now, and most services and wallets have fixed it by not relying solely on the transaction IDs. That's also the reason why it was never really a high priority issue for the core devs, as the impact was fairly low, and they wanted to implement a solution that not only fixes this special case of malleability, but hopefully all potential cases (BIP0062).
And even though the impact was still low from what this spammer guy did, it somehow created a lot of "media buzz" around the issue, which is probably why the core devs put out a quick fix now.

How is your incoherent rambling in any way relevant here?
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:28:57
You know, just because a certain group might be taking advantage of the concerns people have regarding this patch to push their own agenda, does in no way mean that these concern are any less valid. But that seems to be your whole line of reasoning here and in other comments I've seen from you.
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:48:02
Yes. You see, bitcoin only like.. enabled.. their business model. But now that uphold exists, everyone should just use uphold of course. That's why they hope that bitcoin won't be around anymore in 5 years.

Still not much, unless you're running it on a shared network or someone else you don't trust has access to your router.
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:31:07
You misunderstood. I'm saying that the individual incentive of a majority of miners is to act in a seemingly altruistic way, because they have a vested interest in the long term success of bitcoin. Or in other words: a lot of miners are also long term holders, which is why this is the rational way for them to behave.
@_date: 2015-10-12 09:58:52
The altruistic behaviour in this case *is* the rational behaviour, unless of course you have no vested interest in the long term viability and success of bitcoin.

If it were so easy to make a reliable "double spend generator", then it would already exist and people would already be using it. But strangely enough, double spending is not a problem. And in places where it is (pretty much only gambling sites), the counterparty can easily reject zero-conf transactions. This patch does nothing to solve this problem, it only makes it worse.
Double spending right now is not a problem because it is not a problem. And where it becomes a problem, it will lead to merchants either relying on confirmations, or adopting confidence requirements which transactions have to meet (such as sufficient fees, no dust outputs, no non-standard op codes etc). 
The only thing this patch does is MAKE it a problem where it isn't one yet. It's stupid in every way. There's absolutely no good reason to implement this instead of the First-seen-safe variant.

My permissioned database can handle 1 billion transactions no problem. Who wants to settle their cash and assets with me? I also require all users to pass KYC/AML requirements just like Setl, so no worries there.

The first thing I would try is uninstalling electrum, re-install the latest version and restore the wallet from the 12 seed words backup (not from the wallet file).
**Make sure you have your seed backed up before uninstalling**
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:36:53
So what they call a "private blockchain" is in reality a transparently shared database with digital signatures and anchoring? 
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:20:13


As others have already pointed out, a centralized/private/permissioned "blockchain" can be seen as a database that borrows some features from decentralized blockchains. But for a truly decentralized and trustless blockchain, a value token is essential as an incentive for the miners to participate and secure the network.
@_date: 2015-10-28 10:19:09
You still have access to your electrum wallet, right? You can display the seed of your wallet anytime, as long as you have the password to it. I think there's even a little symbol in the bottom right that will let you display the seed.

And how does that make him in any way interesting as a person? What would you want to know about him, just because he was the first person to be bored enough to write and run a fairly simple script that exploits a well known and documented issue, and slightly annoy or inconvenience a few people while doing so?
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:22:05


Afaik bitcoin is only one of many deposit options. Why do you automatically assume that it should make up a large portion of the MMM deposits? Is there any indication that this is actually the case?


Is there anything besides the many many assumptions you made that would support this conclusion? I would guess there has to be for you to be so certain of it, right?
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:11:03
Why would this guy think that anyone would be interested in him doing an AMA? So he wrote a script to take every transaction, do some ECDSA stuff to it that was already well known and documented, and broadcast the new transaction. Big. Fucking. Deal. My only question would be: how bored were you when you decided to do this?
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:24:42


I still remember when banks paid you interest for letting them hold your money.
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:26:48
Oh, I thought that was common knowledge around here. Sorry for not explaining this as the basis of my rant.

But you're not holding gold in any sense. Instead you're entrusting a company with your money, and trust them to give it back to you, based on the exchange rate of gold. At no point in this process does there even have to be any gold involved, ever.
It's replacing a "stable form of value" with an IOU from some company that promises to treat it like gold. It's not better, it's worse in every way. It's a complete perversion of what makes gold a "stable form of value" in the first place, namely the fact that it can't be created in almost unlimited amounts by banks. The IOU is not gold, it's creating the illusion of gold, and that illusion can be created as often as people are willing to entrust their money with a company like Uphold in exchange for an IOU that gives them the illusion of gold.

The probabilistic nature of the taint of coinjoin outputs is what increases fungibility: when every output has a certain probability of being tainted, then all bitcoins are the same again.

Doesn't matter. They just needed bitcoin to get it all started (because it wasn't possible without bitcoin), but bitcoin really doesn't offer anything useful, so they won't need it anymore once it allowed them to do their thing.

Even though I use bitcoin quite regularly, I haven't been affected by this malleability thing. But I heard it's supposed to break bitcoin or something? Am I using it wrong?
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:41:08
At what point do you take them back? What if one of the kid's parents puts it into a safe deposit box for them until their 18th birthday? And when they take it out, it's all gone, because the guy who gave it to them took it back without asking.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:02:29
But now you need new bitcoins to reload your alarm clock, and nobody can sell you the ones you just burnt.

Yes. But it would be nice to have an option to create a new receiving address in mobile wallets too.

The fee for your transaction is very low with only 1 sat/byte. What wallet did you use and how did you set the fee?
@_date: 2015-10-20 19:47:32
They don't. They apparently plan to, but right now they don't. Stop spamming Tutanota in here until they actually do accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:40:11
Might be important to mention that is fee per 1000 bytes, while most normal transactions are a lot smaller than 1000 bytes.

No, it is very much an individual incentive, as free riding in this case comes with the risk of contributing to a reduction in usability that weighs far more in *potential individual loss of wealth* than the very minuscule individual gain in value from free riding.

I think it depends on which arm of the US government you ask.
@_date: 2015-10-19 10:43:32
No you can't stop it. You'd have to wait until it either gets confirmed, or it gets dropped from the mempool and you can send it again.
If your wallet has implemented CPFP (raising fee via child-pays-for-parent), then you could use that. But so far only one or two wallets have implemented it.
However, you could try to do a manual CPFP attempt, by sending the unconfirmed change from that transaction to a different address, using a high enough fee. But there is no guarantee that this is going to work, because it depends on the miner's policy as far as I know, and I'm not sure how many miners are following CPFP so far.
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:44:04


Good idea. Next time it could be the other way around and you accidentally send 30 bitcoins instead of 30 millibitcoins :)
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:59:38
That is true. Unfortunately there really isn't a comprehensive explanation of what exactly makes a "private blockchain" more useful than a conventional database. Maybe it's all a big trade secret or something, who knows. But if something sounds stupid, and nobody can explain to you why it isn't stupid, then chances are that it is indeed stupid.

Am I seeing this right that the balance in the screenshot is in millibitcoins? And you're sending less than 1 millibitcoin in each transaction? My guess would be that this is below the minimum deposit amount for Neteller. So the transactions seem to be going through just fine (the one you linked has 18 confirmations already), but Neteller might simply not register the very small amounts.
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:24:46
Ugh. Why did you make me watch a 10 months old video of a guy travelling around the world, talking about gold? It added no new information at all.  


Where did I say it was different? Just because Uphold's business model is essentially being a bank, doesn't automatically make it any better, does it? Also, the whole idea of digital gold isn't new at all: 






Uhm yeah. That's exactly how fractional reserve banking creates new money out of thin air, by creating new IOUs that are partially backed by reserves. The same is even true for (paper-)gold, even though nobody wants to admit it.

Everyone profits from every miner being "altruistic" here, which means a miner's behaviour diretly affects bitcoin's utility and indirectly its value. The behaviour of all the other miners has no bearing on this individual decision making process.

Nobody can censor, stop or delay a transaction you make to anyone anywhere. And nobody can withhold, take away, or systematically devalue your bitcoins.
