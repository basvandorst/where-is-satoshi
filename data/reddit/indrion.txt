No I'm pretty sure drawing users away is *exactly* what we want to do actually.
They are a scam app. Did you forget about BCa$h?
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:17:34
Don't be, I found it amusing and it got you clicks
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:24:24
It's not that it wasn't announced, it's that people clearly knew exactly when to dump into it as it happened.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:13:01
Eyyy, I'll check it out based just on the rant. If you need any help with promotion let me know

It's not hard to track someone down online, especially if they're motivated by a fuckload of untraceable money.

Same, I finally got my ass in gear and bought a bunch of ADA
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:34:17
BIT. COIN. CASH.

Is it still considered day trading if you're just buying when it looks low enough to justify it and you aren't selling?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:18:04
I've been tempted, have a little under $600, most of it I bought around 15k
Almost had a heart attack when I looked at LTC this morning vs last night when I bought more too. 
If it all sinks, whatever. At least I stuck to something I believe in.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:38:18
You mean a bunch of rich old people who are poised to lose money and their stakes in how money works are telling people desperately not to use it?
Every time some rich old fuck cries about how crypto is fake I laugh knowing that they're the ones who's bubble is going to pop.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:09
Why did you leave LTC?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:42:34
They've moved on to writing news articles about how crypto is the devil.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:16:26
I'd tell him to learn the phrase buy low sell high.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:08:59
I mean I don't expect change overnight or anything. I'm not even thinking of pulling out for at least a year from now minimum. Even if there's a drop, I believe cryptos are gonna get bigger long term.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:32:02
It's sitting around $150 now :P
I bought in last night at $155 after it spiked to $170, woke up to it at $130 and wanted to kick myself for not holding out. 
Once it hits 4 digits, that won't matter so much though
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:27:11
By your logic you should just stay in, buy more in January, sit on it until November, and sell at the next scheduled spike.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:16:20
So you're saying you would have rather stayed in...?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:27:26

Bahahahaha, this is gold

I mean it takes hours to send from a wallet to a wallet, but when I use my card on Coinbase it's an instant transfer.
Personally, I'd say if you're trying to invest, you shouldn't be pulling out just because you see a dip happening. Especially because Id end up losing on transfer fees from BTC Core to Coinbase to sell it, and like you said that's gonna take time. By time it transfers and you sell it could be way lower. But give it a few days and it could shift up again. 
I'm not touching my coins until at least next december unless it's an emergency. Even by next year I probably won't actually pull out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:06:15
From my understanding, the miners fee is for the people running the computers that are verifying each transaction. The more people queued up to transfer, the higher it gets. 
Larger transactions are also going to take longer to confirm if they're built up of a bunch of smaller transactions totalling to the number being transferred versus if you just bought the amount and transferred it. The reason being that if you send 1btc but you got that by getting a bunch of really small transactions, each of those individual transactions need to be verified.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:38:50
No. No you don't.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:02:38
Damn, that blows. Not sure if it's worth investing into, but I've heard ADA might blow up, last I checked a few days ago it was ~12¢/coin. 
I've got a wallet set up, but I'm being lazy about transferring some ETH over to fund it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:35:28
For real, as soon as I noticed the guy that somehow accidentally sent the money "verified who he was" all while never making any posts until after it started the scream bullshit faster than people scream sell at the slightest drop.

I thought there was slightly more risk involved with an online wallet as opposed to one stored on your computer? Or is the risk not actually as big as I interpreted?   Regardless, out of the few that you listed which one would you recommend overall?  I know it mostly comes down to personal preference, but when it comes down to comparing them I don't really know what I'm looking for.  
Also, one more thing, I'm guessing that ChangeTip isn't quite a "wallet" as it is a third party system specifically just for tipping through posts, right? So if I'm planning on saving some of that tip from you (thank you, by the way) as opposed to tipping it all forward, I should get an online wallet set up like you said and transfer it into there? Or is it just as secure in CT as it would be in another server?
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:23:13
GreenAddress seems to run on it, I'd prefer BitGo, but they won't let me just sign up
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:41:04
Cool, thanks.  I actually already tried to send some of my money from ChangeTip to Circle, so I'll just have to send that over once it's completed.  I'm assuming it's normal for it to take a little while for the transaction to process.
Also, the fluctuation on the amount is just the exchange rate changing, right? Like my tip was for $5, but then it showed $5.01, and later went down to $4.98.  And when I sent $4 to my wallet it showed as receiving $4.01.  Just the market fluctuating?
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:43:56
Which phone wallet would you recommend for ios? It's a 4 so I'm on ios7 if it makes a difference
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:25:27
How do I get it into my wallet? I got a tip about a year ago that I accepted and forgot about, and just got Bitcoin Core Wallet last night, but even after letting it run all night it's still syncing to the server.  I tried generating some receive codes for one of those sites that give you .00001btc or whatever for watching an ad, but when I checked on Blockchain.info it said that both codes I had didn't have any amounts associated with it.
It should still be able to receive money though, right? If they actually sent it I would be able to see it on Blockchain, and it just wouldn't show up in the wallet until it was actually synced.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:22:17
Would you rather them or Circle? I signed up for both and I can't really decide, but Circle lets you buy bitcoins through them and they claim to not have fees.
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:36:29
How is that not worth something in itself? They have an official wallet with support that can even generate paper wallets now.
@_date: 2019-03-14 03:32:29
Cardano? BAT?

Chase did the same thing to me.  Call their corporate offices, and demand that you have the evidence supplied by the merchant to Chase sent to you.
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:14:37
Pretty sure until it's charged and gonna through due process it's "presumed" not "well established"

By time I figure out how to get this, I'm sure I'll be able to buy mad drugs with it

You and I both know that "contacting local law enforcement" is a joke.

His coins? If they were his coins they wouldn't have them to begin with.  Anything on an exchange is subject to disappearance.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:46:26
Just because Coinbase is reeeing doesn't mean they did something illegal.
