What a dumb thing to say.

It is mildly infuriating to try and mine for coins on TestNet, and faucets only give out very small amounts which aren't enough to do serious testing.
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:00:32
Would you not want it to match the real network as closely as possible?
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:53:36
What are you into?

When block time goes from ~10 minutes to ~20 minutes for like a month.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:44:21
I do not believe there are genuine users of that sub.
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:59:59
Smells like desperation.

Step one: spelling.

My kernel is getting panicky and killing things using lots of ram, generally bitcoind.
htop says bitcoind has ~6.5GB resident allocated, which seems higher than it should be by about 3x.

As if these clowns invented the possibility of a hardfork?
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:57:07
He can't.  
BU can't even maintain their own fork without introducing serious bugs.  They are thousands of commits behind core, it seems unlikely they will accept any more core feature contributions for political reasons.
They are dead in the water.

My confusion is that 6459 &gt; 2048 + 512.

Oh man, you must be new here, welcome!

If you are doing this for your business then you probably do not want to rely on a single point of failure that you are not paying for/have no SLA.
It's pretty trivial to setup bitcoind with PHP with a JSON RPC.
Or get fancy and stand up you own instance of Toshi.
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:57:55
I have mixed feelings about this.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:18:08
I believe we have even seen such malware that utilizes GPU resources as well.


These are actually quite easy to detect.  The user will notice serious slow downs on their system performance with their fans screaming the whole time.
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:14:07
No argument.  I merely acknowledged it as a possibility.  People can change their minds or even go against their own recommendations.

On one hand I am of the opinion that software patents are a bad thing, on the other hand they are a non-trivial aspect of the software ecosystem today.  Me believing software patents to be idiotic won't make them go away.
So while I'm not thrilled that Coinbase has filed for these patents, at least they are a company attempting to innovate in the bitcoin space.  I believe it would be worse to see a patent troll/squatter or somebody like Goldman Sachs in their place.
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:16:04
That's not how it works.
@_date: 2015-09-14 14:30:58


Sounds legit.

The possibility also exists that he lost them on purpose.

I don't believe that is how the activation rules behave.

Friendly reminder, don't feed the trolls :)

Just ignore him, he's a particularly vocal (but not very effective) troll.

When you make statements like this, it implies you have no other leg on which to stand.
@_date: 2015-03-30 13:08:32
[Yes he did.](
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:51:35
Why are you even complaining right now? 
Heed your own advice and buy the dip.

I think the support email is wrong.  It should read moses  
But you might have a hard time reaching him if everybody there has already left.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:31:11
Yeah, right.

You made this?  I made this.  Thanks!

Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?

A better analogy than "the internet of money."
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:57:44
Classic case of a solution looking for a problem.  Why would anybody use this over kickstarter or similar?
Find the real problem, immerse yourself in it to understand it, *then* try and solve it with technology.
Don't walk around with a Bitcoin hammer, because then everything will look like a nail.
Good luck.

Perhaps you should start a new sub, something like Surely there you can get your message through without hindrance.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:54:17
Another account, eh?
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:39:04
Oh, to be young.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:43:11
Bad idea.

I can only imagine trying to read that off a teleprompter and having a nightmare of a time while my brain tries to "help" string correct word sequences together.
