I don't think lightning channel funds can be topped off. you have to make a new on chain transaction and basically start another channel, afaik.

He/She's not saying the mempool is actually empty. He/She's saying that if all transactions currently made were segwit transactions, the mempool would be decreasing dramatically and could actually be empty.
The mempool is pretty full right now.

Upvoting any decently well founded posts urging caution.
The mania is real.
I believe in Bitcoin long-term and will hodl through just about anything. Looking at the posts around here it seems like quite a few people are over invested though and probably wouldn't be able to hold through a medium term bear market. 
Everyone assumes that any dip/correction is just short term, will be back up in a few days. but what if a correction takes a few months? Half a year? What if it drops by 40% and THEN keeps going down for an extended period of time?
How many will really hodl? Will the memes still sustain it?
Just be careful out there.

Hey man,
I'm sorry to hear you feeling so down. But please dont beat yourself up over missed opportunities. It simply doesnt help. 
From what you said, it doesnt really seem like not having bought bitcoin is the real problem, just another factor exacerbating the negative feelings your experiencing.
Bitcoin is not going to help you here. it wont make your financial problems go away. Much less any other problems you're experiencing. 
I would strongly suggest you make a change in your actual day to day life, starting with seeing a mental health professional. Please call and talk to someone who can help you.

Why would i do this?
I want bitcoin to be a currency as much as anyone else, but why would i spend a whole bunch of time and effort to buy back the bitcoin i just spent, if i could just use my devaluating FIAT instead?
It just doesnt make sense.

Is the mad money interview with square anywhere to be found? Would like to see it.

and have what i bought cost me extra hours of time, possibly make me have to pay more for the same amount of bitcoin and trading/tx fees?  WHY?

Depends on what you want to do with bitcoin? 
If your just buying to sell again soon at a profit, you're taking a gamble, just as you would be with any other cryptocurrency. No one KNOWS that the price will keep rising. So in that sense, unless your a trader who knows what he/she's doing, buying bitcoin or any other coin is a risk. It is now, just as it was a year ago, or at any time for that matter. 
But if you're buying bitcoin because you believe in the underlying technology, want to be part of the societal change, then you're never too late.
That being said, i do believe with the current hype and investing coming in, the price trajectory does seem to be pointing up for quite a while yet.

What incentive do i have for using it?
Bitcoin is much more valuable to me than FIAT, so why spend bitcoin?
I mean sure, when its at 600k and and is globally accepted as a currency, ill use it, because i won't be holding FIAT anymore and have no reason to. But spending bitcoin right now seems unnecessary.

I agree 100%.
We shouldn't be telling newcomers that, yes, you should definitely buy. We should be educating them on the ecosystem and the risks involved. I believe everybody should hold bitcoin, but that's my belief that I've come to after much research. Having newcomers skip this step seems misguided. Holding Bitcoin can get very scary very quick if you have a lot invested. Throwing noobs into this madness unprepaired just seems wrong.

Running a node does nothing to support the ecosystem. What it does is let you independently verify that all payments you receive are infact valid according to the rules of the chain you support.
