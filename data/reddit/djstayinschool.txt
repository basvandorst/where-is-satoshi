Maybe there's like a Japan, South Dakota or something. Worth looking into.

Humans are biased towards seeing patterns even when there are none. Mostly it works out ok. Mostly.

Are Trezors/Ledgers susceptible to these types of hack?

Woof. Other viable options to the Linux LiveCD suggestion?

Shouldn't the volatility go down as the price goes up?

Read Mr. Money Mustache's blog.

Ghana's  Interesting. Thanks for the link.

80% VTI 20% Bitcoin. Consider rebalancing every X months.

This is just classic Satoshi.

Amazing that you were able to do this. Congratulations!
Maybe you could calculate what the mortgage would have been and put all (or some) of that mount back into BTC each month.

Would it make sense to valuate the volume of transactions against the (approx) number of holders? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:53
If only they would publish the exact time frame for phase 1. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:57:47
Not being snarky, but do we know that people in those areas are actually using it? I hope so!
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:54:17
Interesting strategy. I like it.

Many people speculate that this creates an in for big financial institutions to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.

Welcome to the club. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:14:30
Can one of you guys let me know when they schedule it?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:13:36
Thanks for the tip!

I feel that the exchanges are more vulnerable than they let on, I also imagine I'd use Airbitz as my pocket money wallet if I'm planning on spending.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:06:20
Doesn't sound too bad...
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:14:44
Thanks for the tip! Will do!
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:45:12
Great advice, 
Thanks for the tips. Would I gain any additional security making a new email address that doesn't have a past history that might be able to lead people to me?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:47:42
Interesting tip on the multisig copay. I'll research it a bit more. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:14:29
Ok, you're the second person to recommend skipping Airbitz, I'll consider doing so. 
I guess that a it seems to me that a "brief" period of time is like 4 nanoseconds with Bitcoin. :)

Got inspired. Bought my weekly limit. In it for the HODL.
