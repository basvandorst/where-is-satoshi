Nice touch with JWT Tokens.

I was having similar issues, export the private key and sweep on electrum or coinkite into a new multisig there, both can work offline and have lots of m-of-n options.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:23:39
What a stupid fucking idea. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:40:59
Looking forward to getting a smoothie with Bitcoin later today!
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:58:43
Server side services like this require trust, but these guys have been around for a long time now, it's a legit Canadian company. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:16:50
Well done, I should setup something too.
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:15:22
Yes, that's what I'm using. 2x HW.1 in a 2-of-3 CoinKite wallet. You just need the new firmware.
@_date: 2015-05-08 12:46:56
What do you mean? It's a smartcard, HW1 has nothing to do with Trezor.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:52:12
**Please stop using Coinbase or any MSB wallet to keep Bitcoin!!!!!!**
As easy as they make it to buy Bitcoin, they are required by law and gag orders to monitor and report users. Buy your Bitcoin, then transfer to another wallet that has privacy. I'm not endorsing crime, I just think people should understand how to have privacy.
In the other thread, I said IMHO there is no point in dealing with Coinbase, they are set on their very lucrative path of becoming the new PayPal.
Start using a real bitcoin wallet that offers privacy (Ellectrum, CoinKite, Breadwallet, Armory, etc...), and there are many alternatives to buy/sell too, including real exchanges (Bitstamp, ItBit, Bitfinex, Circle, etc...).
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:57:20
You either start taking some responsibility or you will get burn, there is no magic pill.
@_date: 2014-03-15 13:20:45
This is exactly what we need, physical stores. I think it's a great idea to have familiar equipment like that. Let people ease in into the new.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:08:42
They don't have to. Using CoinKite Multisig with their Offline Key generator or with a Leger Nano takes a second to setup and is easy to use. They can even use a stand alone Breadwallet for smaller amounts. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:12:37
That's why I'm using 2x Ledger Nanos with CoinKite Multisig, I can never fully trust the hardware.
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:35:07
In SHA we trust! PGP is an amazing thing.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:17:45
Yes, buy and move somewhere else. Move to a wallet that has privacy.
@_date: 2015-05-08 12:45:28
Many other options: 
- **[Breadwallet]( (iOS small amounts) 
- **[CoinKite]( (Multisig for large amounts)
- **[Mycellium]( (Android small amounts)
- **[Ledger]( (Smartcard/Hardware wallet)
- **[Electrum]( (Offline option)
Note: 
- Only use phone wallets for pocket money, never store your savings in it.
- For any amount that you can't lose, use multisig.
- Prefer wallets that have been around for a long time with no incidents.
*Edit: for clarification and bullets*
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:45:04
Yes. My next step is setup a secondary wallet with the same setup, but my wife will have the other ledger. This way either me or her can sign transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:19:39
Get a HW1 works the same and [costs 15 bucks]( 
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:17:25
Sounds like "Genetic Fallacy"

Just called my brother, US =&gt; Spain. Voice quality is decent.

And yet not added, nor official plans to add it. Coinbase is now on a VC leash.

Then just setup a standard multisig account, much more secure then what they have, and takes a minute.
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:52:22
This new trend of tweeting from prison through lawyers is hilarious. Nice to see he is in good spirits. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:47:37
I think Coinkite and Greenaddress are amazing companies too. Unlike blockchain.info they don't display ads. Coinkite was one of the first to offer an .onion address.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:02:11
Far from it, people should just not use *Banks* to do Bitcoin, Coinbase is a *Bank* not a Bitcoin company.
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:29:41
Too young and plans on being an exchange.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:11:25
Nice to hear, maybe they are on vacation. Any chance you can ask them to come post here and confirm they are still continuing their project. They use to be very active here.
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:14:48
This product concerns me because they have the majority needed to take funds. I'm not saying that are bad people, but government can compel them to release customers' funds.
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:24:24
Tumble them, or convert them to alts then back. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:40:06
And pay $199 for a Case wallet when take have 2 of the 3 keys, no thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:56:04
Mycelium is fine, use it for pocket amounts and make sure you always backup your key before putting any bitcoin in it.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:01:19
I have no doubt this will happen.
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:02:29
They have not made any updates or commits in weeks, I think it's possible the project was abandoned. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:17:08
I tried a couple, but I've been very happy with [Coinkite]( they let me generate my keys offline and as a bonus support Ledger.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:32:51
I think  but it even better: 


@_date: 2015-05-06 17:15:05
As I mentioned on the other thread, that's what I'm using. 
2x Ledgers in a 2-of-3 CoinKite wallet for my savings, to me is the best of both worlds. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:28:39
Does anyone know how long until this is actually running on a side chain? 1 month or 1 year time frame?
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:16:53
You probably lost your password, hard to believe the wallet was hacked.
PS: don't root your phone if you will keep bitcoin in it!
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:45:50
I'm pretty sure he was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2015-08-17 12:58:02
I think this is a very important message, it's a thankless job.
@_date: 2015-08-26 04:00:20
And for many other wallets I like, not sure what your problem is but all you do is troll. They are not even competitors. If you will make accusations at least point to something that makes sense, like BCI.
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:20:33
Always check the signature on any binary and if you can compile from source.  
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:03:23
Stop using microsoft products, it's all broken closed source crap. There are tons of Linux distros to choose from, OpenBSD and OSX.
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:44:30
short answer: It's solid*
*It's an open source project that anyone can change, but the majority would have to agree.
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:15:24
Coinkite actually told me to use AirBitz to find places to spend bitcoin.
*Edit – Odd, the troll/hater's post I replied to vanished. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:19:26
I can't wait for them to accept! They use braintree it's odd they don't already.
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:44:35
I think that's pretty good, we do have a lot of terminology that needs improvement. While you are at that, his site needs to call sub-accounts; wallets.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:11:53
Yes, but... They can still lock you out, track all your transactions and should not be used for this. There are many other better options for mutlsig. Use them to buy or cash in hand (it's a nice app) but keep your bulk in electrum, coinkite or armory. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:01:02
They know what's coming, but wont willingly point it out of they "don't have to". If you pretend it doesn't exist, you can probably get away with it. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:16:02
So many good software releases today! 
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:22:08
Decentralized tipping is cool, have you tried Lighthouse?
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:09:12
Great, more people get exposed to crypto currencies than dump the GovCoin for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:40:41
Just use the Tor browser, much easier.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:13:53

That's great news!
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:23:16
Nice to see this kind of partnership, Bitcoin is much safer because of it.
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:40:50
I've being using  API for my app.
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:32:33
That's a great stunt! 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:33:33
Clever UI, this is very useful. Sometimes I want to go faster some times I don't, I think this accomplishes that. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:35:53
We need all these given to Apache foundation. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:32:22
You cannot secure a decentralized Blockchain without a reward for the miners. Centralized blockchains are pointless, as a standard database is more efficient.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:05:02
Nice to see more advancing here, specially with so much rhetoric.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:44:59
LocalBitcoins or Mycelium local trader are a good start.
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:53:43
Coinapult uses Coinkite as multsig back-end, they are in Canada.
@_date: 2015-04-21 02:19:10
Big fan of this one too. Coinkite and Ellectrum work great for me.
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:47:45
CoinKite, Breadwallet and Ellectrum
@_date: 2015-09-03 20:44:13
Congrats on the numbers. It's hard to find companies that deliver as much as you do, keep up the great work. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:40:45
What's the gist?
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:45:25
Which countries?
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:35:02
Do you ever sleep, 2 announcements? Thanks for listening, I've being wanting to do transactions with multiple outputs for a while. The custom fee is just the cherry on top. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 01:51:23
That's pretty cool, I was building some escrow web app for domain sales using coinkite.com api to handle the multisig wallets and parse.com as most of my database with very little back end. Would love to hear how you are designing the multisig/escrow tech.
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:51:41
r/bitcoin users are not redditors, it's a different usage pattern
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:27:06
Give them the benefit of the doubt and teach the right from the start. Don't use centralized IOUs.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:31:32
When are we going to see a more polished build that doesn't broadcast the user's IP? 
Keep up the great work!
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:30:25
This is definitely one of the apps we need, I'm just don't believe they will have any success with a smart phone app. They need an SMS service that works with ultra cheap phones are what people use in poor countries.
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:35:32
Great news I hope these guys don't get in trouble; Lavabit.
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:21:01

The number of companies is incredible.
@_date: 2015-10-26 17:10:01
Lots of alternatives, you could use [Coinsimple]( or [Coinkite](

On android, Mycelium + Ledger! 
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:39:08
Shameless cheer leader for [Coinkite]( and [Ellectrum]( haven't had any issues with either.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:48:17
Same here, this is an amazing project. They just have a lot of software to write.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:26:06
I would use [this api]( with the [voucher endpoint]( for distribution and use their multi-signature to hold the funds. It would make it for a much better and decentralized version of what you are describing.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:24:46
He can create a wallet on a secure service with multi-signature, best of both worlds.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:47:02
Here is a professional solution 
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:44:49
It was painful but will rebound. Hold!
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:32:00
Most of them are having issues handling the [malleability]( Just run your own node if you need the most up to date info or try  they have being coping well.

Totally! 100bits

I have RES tagged and upvote all his stuff when I see it :P
@_date: 2015-10-07 17:48:17
We do something similar, but using Dollar and Euro Exchanges. My advice is distribute the risk, we use CoinKite multi-signaure API as my App's hot-wallet (my App display that address for customers to deposit). Then we split the funds sending into multiple exchanges (BitFinex, BitStamp, Coinapult and BTC-e), after confirmation I check the market depth and sell there to hold the price. I keep some bankroll in hot-wallet for when customers need some funds out. When needed we buy Bitcoin and send to CoinKite from the exchanges into the hot-wallet to top up my float. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:45:48
lol typo. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:50:47
How can people trust a debt based system and get away with it? 
They are doing fractional reserve just like bad banks, you don't own the coins you have on Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:34:20
good point.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:08:59
Stop spelling Bitcoin with a capital "C". 
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:32:10
It is against the BitCoin idea, one should be able to see his addresses balance on the public ledger. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:16:59
You are kidding right? They only charge 1% if you are doing more than 1,000,000 in transactions, which is likely no one at this point.
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:05:14
There really is only one way to know... ;)
How do they make money if they do not invest the BitCoins, only investment capital is not enough.
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:26:11
I cannot trust any website that have all the BitCoins on the same pool. It is the same reason why I do not keep the funds on the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:26:10
It's great to see our topics on TV, but this show is so far from legally correct that i want to cry.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:40:36
I've also been using them for a while them, great service that also supports LTC. I do wished they buy/sell coins too. They also sent me the Debit Card.
