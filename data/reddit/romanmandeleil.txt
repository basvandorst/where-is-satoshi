Hey matthew_boyd, thanks for the feedback , I think Bitcoin in general is already in the stage when people can show their face without being afraid , especially on the testnet.

Thanks guys

Yeah there is much more in common between Bitcoin and Ethereum communities in general.

What value do you have in mind more than we did already?
Can you describe it please in 1 sentence example?
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:32:40
Bitcoin people?

Some of our users are part of bitcoin community and we want to continue to offer more of them to join the circle of Virtual Accelerator startups

I think that a core philosophical values of crypto community are shared between Bitcoin and Ethereum and more valuable crypto tokens. So as we building Virtual Accelerator which should be helpful for pushing young startups forward it should be equally helpful for readers of that subreddit.

I do agree with you that blockchain is immutable 
or there is no blockchain. The only excuse for DAO 
fork and state change was that Ethreum blockchain 
is still an ongoing development process. Once it is 
done the foundation should die and let it go.

Why do you think it is a spam?
