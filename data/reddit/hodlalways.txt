Long time reader, first time poster. I bought during the massive bull run in December. 
In case anyone is in the same position as me, here's my experience so far. 
I decided to sell a few days ago, even at a loss because there is a lot of uncertainty (lol) and it seemed to me (disclaimer: I know nothing about trading) like the price was headed down towards a major correction and I wanted to at least save some of my cash for potential purchases of BTC later. 
I don't really understand the 'HODL' argument unless you are prepared to see it go down to $500 before it goes to 10k, 15k, etc. I wanted to adopt a more proactive strategy and mitigate any future losses whilst also having cash to buy in at future opportunities. 
So far it seems like I made the right decision. I bought in a little bit yesterday during the beginning of this drop and having one foot in, one foot out is working out ok so far.
Best of luck everybody!

I sold on the first massive dip and then felt so much anxiety during the first giant rally (before the even worse dip). You can always reverse HODL - wait for another dip to buy again if it's in line with your investment strategy.

Tough times. Even if it gets worse - and a full
 on crash is looking quite likely IMO - remember what's important - if you've got your health, family or a partner to love and still some savings then you have much to be grateful for!

Totally agree, and that's exactly what has happened here in my case.

News flash! You're not actually dying, it's just numbers going up and down. If it goes down again, your buying power goes up �� reverse HODL!!!

Yes, I understand it, and that's what it felt like after that initial rally after 7.6k - but now the price is really struggling in the same areas where previously it shot up. 
IMO, HODL makes sense if you bought in at around this price, give or take some percentage that you could tolerate. I bought in at a much higher price, which it may never return to, so following a philosophy didn't really seem like a strategy.
