Not sure, why don't you ask LBC...have you seen the volumes? Many LBC sellers charge over 9% and many people glady pay. LibertyX obviously isn't meeting the entire market's needs.

And there are a ton of local bitcoin sellers next to that location too. So what?

People who would pay the same % or more as LBC but prefer a safer alternative. Travelers who don't have time to meet up with someone on mycelium and prefer to go to an instant location which is consistently open.

You've never seen a political cartoon before have you?

Do you mean the same Satoshi that Ver says we must follow his vision?
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:27:31
No, it won't. You're just in your head.

Opinions are one thing. Trying to hard fork the network and pump alts at the same time when you have publicly stated that you think Segwit is a good idea is another.

If interested means pumping shit premined alts to newbs coming into crypto for the first time like wolf of wall street, then I disagree. Bitcoin jesus is now bitcoin judas.

I think this is perfect for mainstream. Easy to understand for average person and although a little more time could have been spent on the Bitcoin aspect...it could have also derped many new adopters out.

I like their fee slider with the ability to do custom fee in sats/byte. Also like how default is now sats.
