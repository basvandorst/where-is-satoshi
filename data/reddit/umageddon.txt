IF all goes well. Thing is when in negotiations with banks/ card companies disputes can arise where said corporations wont refund you even if you are not at fault.

@_date: 2014-03-02 18:19:49
Im for bitcoin self regulation when it comes to the actual technology and operation therof. 
The Bitcoin protocol lends itself by design to self regulate - via the blockchain. Its up to the users to be *responsible* and make sure things run smoothly. IMO
Where it becomes shaky is when big players cause major havoc in  the system as we've already seen with Mt. Gox. 
Not sure at this point in time how to go about solving something like that. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:58:22
Transaction fees are optional and up to the user. Period.

Fixed: Elements of government. 
I think this distinction should be made as most blanket statements are just, IMO, wrong.
There *are* some honest people left in governments around the world.  
Ultimately when you say government, you essentially mean a group of people, and not all people have psychotic belief systems.  
With that said, I agree 95% with your statement

I agree. Nothing is black or white but infinite shades of grey. 
Government, to me, is like a glove: its who is wearing the glove that is the issue. But sometimes the glove needs repair or replacement. 
The worst thing we can do is play the divisive game.

This is good! I was hoping for a wallet / core split. Also bittorrent like blockchain sharing is really, really needed. 
A couple things i think may be needed:
1) 1 click updating.. Maybe using blockchain to store MD5 of updated software for verification. 
2) not sure if this is possible (can plaintext hashes be compressed?) but blockchain compression of some kind... Even if a 10% reduction in size could be huge when blockchain gets &gt;50Gb size
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:59:06

@_date: 2014-02-26 21:10:43
No but the 'insurance' provided by these banks shows how much trust you can ultimately put in an institution when the going gets rough. Its people you ultimately trust... Not words on paper. 
People who like to downplay bitcoin have no quibbles pointing out devious overseas transactions with bitcoin - why cant the same standard apply here?
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:36:31

Granted not are all banking institutions, but were -trusted- by investors/public. 
Trust is ultimately what you are questioning here and i honestly dont see much reason to trust many of the institutions were are 'supposed' to.

Sure, but the problem is trust. Many regulatory bodies are corrupt. (Ie- revolving doors with corporations). Regulators are ultimately people. People can be corrupted. 
I argue that the bitcoin protocol subverts this by allowing a properly educated community as a whole regulate itself. Nobody wants to kill their own golden goose

Why cant one or the other just apologize and admit the misunderstanding. 
Seems internet kiddies always have to be so goddamed outspoken

OR (original reply)
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:37:04
I agree somewhat. 
It just depends on what your definition of peace is. 
Words mean different things to different people.

I know i'll be lambasted for saying this, but i feel sorry for the guy in a way. 
His demeanour seems genuinely sorry to me. 
Obviously I'm not apologizing for the tremendous damage he has done, it's just sad to see someone who dosent seem aggressive or psychopathic so humiliated and scared. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:16:55
Why am i so important? Im thinking of other peoples experiences here. What happens to me is irrelevant to this discussion

Why do people always assume the extreme of what others are saying?

Same can be said of thieve(s) of mtgox - what incentive do you have to steal coins without being able to do anything with them. They will eventually spent back into circulation 
Thats assuming the coins were stolen (not lost) of course. 
If lost, assuming said thieve(s) don't have motive other then greed, the value of the remaining coins are worth a little more. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:35:15
Nice dodge!

Can you say 'group-think' and 'cognitive dissidence'? 
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:31:47
*Seriously* doubt that.

Running a node helps secure the network and in turn your investment
In a way, isnt that a kind of payment for your services?
Although a small BTC kickback would be nice for sure.

Id like to add that the pendulum swings the other way often as well. 
Freedom shouldn't be a dirty word. 
I think it would be in many peoples best interest to contemplate what responsibility for ones thoughts means and what critical thinking skills actually are. 
If the grammar or logic is flawed, the rhetoric is just more noise.

Guess you can see into the future?  Cool!
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:18:46
Agreed. From what ive been able to glean of human nature in my lifetime is that old ideas die hard (if at all) and new ones take a few gallons of water to get it down. 
I think at its core, lifeforms are inherently lazy (by that i mean, they will always gravitate to the easiest solution). I don't think ideas/paradigms escape this law. 
So as someone gets older and hasn't worked to keep their mind subtle, he/she will have a helluva time scraping off the mental crud to 'see the light' of anything novel or new that dosent fit established thought patterns. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:08:06
Its all up in the air then?
Good that we can agree on that. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:36:52
Tell me how ink on paper magically gains value? 
Answer : Because we agree to it.  I suppose people like you are prone to magical thinking thou.

I dont care if there are rich people. Did i say that?
I do care when rich (rich usually means powerful) people try and force their beliefs upon me and others without our consent thou.

Im not trying to be politically correct. I would personally like to see language that dosent box people in, but to allow room for mistakes in behaviour. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:56:35
Agreed! Im not claiming this as fact. 
The point i am making is that there's always the possibility of devious behaviour - the fact that many people dismiss this *out-of-hand* is what bothers me

Listen, all Im saying that all corporate culture/media (ie - disseminated/promoted by corporate interests), 'non-profit' or not, deserves honest skepticism and not blind devotion.  
Be vigilant, chivalrous and truthful at all times and dont play the political BS mind-games that are heaped on us. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:14:09
What was the issue(s)?
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:08:09
Personally none.  Why is it relevant anyways?
Hows the coffee?
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:57:08
I think everyone agrees that angry, red faced trolls such as yourself need to sit back, relax and leave people to their own business - instead of trying to force everyone into your narrow idea of reality
Honestly ask yourself: why do you care?

Why get caught up in the argument over inflation/deflation.  Banking/merchant class brought us that concept via interest. 
Im more interested in stability.
