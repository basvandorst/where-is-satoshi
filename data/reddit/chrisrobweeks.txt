I'm sort of new to BTC so serious question: Couldn't we all look up in the blockchain whether or not this happened? Not without their address, right?

Is anyone concerned about this?

I already have a barcode, might as well get one that pays me.

I'm pretty new here, so pardon me if I'm misunderstanding something. It seems to be the resounding sentiment here that Bitcoin Cash is trash. So why is r/btc celebrating that Coinbase now buys, sells, and trades in BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:22:43
That's how I felt, but I'm a bit of a noob so I wanted this community's read on it. FUD is generally good for those of us with btc, yes?

Just watched Banking on Bitcoin (on Netflix) last night to dig deeper into crypto. I'm glad I did because it and this post helped fill in a lot of the contextual stuff that gets lost online.
Any other documentary suggestions or required reading?

Why are you assuming he doesn't know anything about crypto?

Worked for me on Relay app.

I love the detail that they are two Hawaiian pizzas. Makes it all the more regrettable.

Yes, I setup small recurring purchases on every paycheck. Big enough to notice my Satoshis adding up over time, small enough that I don't immediately feel it missing from my account. Replace FOMO with HODL.

Haha yeah, should read first *legal* purchase.

I'll cede that the US government of the past 40+ years (both parties) has been stealing our future, but only through massive tax cuts for the richest 4 families in the country and slashing of govt programs like social security that every taxpayer is entitled to. If you're mad about paying taxes and not about the tax breaks the ultra-rich receive, you're a chump.

Well yeah, I don't like the term but it's the one "they" agreed on. Or do you really hate everyone born between ~1980 and ~2000?
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:23:31
To be fair I'm one of them and hate most of them, too. But mostly I hate how the media portrays us. But that's every generation's prerogative, shit on the younger one.
@_date: 2018-07-23 15:24:06
It really is haha

It was nearly 2.5 hours and really let me down. They made a lot of unnecessary changes that really spoiled the movie for me.
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:15:07
shhh bruh they're listening..
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:27:35
I just don't know why they'd change the first test so drastically. Even if licensing was an issue, what they put into the movie was nothing as heavy as in the book.

But it says right on the side, it's unlawful to use for any purpose beyond carrying milk!

Shut up Wesley!!!

I do not care for it, no. May have liked it if I hadn't read the book first.
