I meant to say exchange.
BitPay seems alright, but I also believe that they are set up in place for large investors to acquire Bitcoin silently, which there is nothing wrong with that.

I actually thought about this before I made my post, I should have trusted my gut instinct.
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:19:44
Thanks a lot for putting this together.

It's all about the money brother. These other exchanges lack the money + experienced team and investors behind them.
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:26:51
Nice spin brother, you should try your hand in politics or become a host at a major news station.
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:22:51
The main thing that gets me is that if they are "the most trusted news source" or reputable at all then they should do some due diligence.
Bullshit sites have bullshit click bait links, so if they aren't a bullshit site they shouldn't let bullshit people advertise.
Their credibility and everything has simply went down the drain by allowing themselves to be bought out by these fly by night scams. I wouldn't be surprised if CryptoDouble or whatever latest Ponzi shows up on there.
They either need to be a news site or a classifieds listing, they need to figure out.
Needless to say the damage is done anyways. Whoever takes CCN seriously is sheeple waiting to be sheered for their money from David Parker &amp; Conspirators.

Just search Coinbase in this reddit, you will see. They are closing accounts that are sending Bitcoin to gambling sites or sites they think are gambling, or any black market / weed / spores or any kind of paraphernalia websites.

I think he would rather keep fucking his readers and earning referrals on each scam they get taken by!
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:22:26
That's what I'm saying.
No real fucking company would want to be associated with these scam bucket shops.
The "owner" is anonymous, what does that tell you? Tells me that this is a fly by night scam promoting circus.

I think I smell bullshit and question dodging.
Give me answers with concrete substance, not dumb excuses with vaporware companies listed.
I heard you guys are so fucking poor down there that you are even jumping out and undercutting someone's Bitcoin ATM to try and make a few bucks. You're actually being sued by an ATM operator that put his machine in your place, that's the only reason people come there. A judge has even served you guys with warnings about the matter yet you still persist.


@_date: 2015-01-24 17:54:43
Why are you a fucking sell out shill ?
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:57:16


Can you elaborate on why you are being sued by a Bitcoin ATM Operator who placed their machine at the Bitcoin Embassy?
How did you guys run and fail at a multi-million dollar mining operation at the embassy?
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:18:33
I'm referring to legal businesses.
Those businesses generally have problems finding processors because of chargebacks and high risk of fraud, Bitcoin solves that. There really isn't a reason why Coinbase or BitPay shouldn't step in and fix this whole thing, it would be a win-win for Bitcoin. 
Although now that I've had time to ponder, I believe it may be because of the banks that Coinbase + BitPay work with which makes them unable to work with these companies.
I believe they need to re-think the whole damn thing and get away from traditional banks.
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:11:03
Liveeeeeeee action!
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:30:44
No, they just want to be Mr. Important Bitcoin guy.
Blowing their own whistle.
First hand evidence, not bullshit. At one point they were giving away free Redbull, what a business model.
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:09:08
Oh fucking come on.
Are you guys really fooled with this front-running exchange wannabe scam bucket?
Get fucking real. Bitcoin was made so you didn't have to trust people, to be your own fucking bank. Bitcoin wasn't made so Coinbase© can be your bank.
PS: There is only ONE major Bitcoin business in the USA, that's Coinbase. Why is that? It's because it's the only one that is willing to sell you out to the state. If it was such a great business model (all this funding, yada yada) then why isn't there any competition in the USA?
PSS: They still won't work with weed companies, porn companies, or other businesses that are shit on by CC companies. These guys are fucking wolves in Jesus clothing @ Sunday Mass. Stop drinking the kool aid. Take the red pill.

Because no one likes him or his bullshit site. I wouldn't be surprised if David Parker was really Michael Morarity PHD, infamous scammer.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:23:56
No screenshots, just possible (very possible) malicious files for download.
If you had any sense or knowledge about Bitcoin, or in safety in general, then you would realize it takes a bit more than "hey, download this and trust me with all your money".
If I make a website with 2 pages and put an executable for download on it, would you run it? 
Get real man. Not saying you're scamming, plan to scam, or anything of that nature. I'm saying whatever the fuck you are doing, put some fucking effort into it.
But as I remember, you're not a marketer or anything of that nature, so why are you dropping subliminal links or even doing here? You're obviously not good with the general public's concern either I see.
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:17:26
Yeah right....
Everyone knows that Coinbase blocks accounts they deem are "suspicious"
There are only 21 Million Bitcoins, so you can rest assured a great portion of them have gone through Silkroad and various other places. We all know this yet for some reason Coinbase is still shutting down accounts that have taint to any of these addresses. It's really sad.
Coinbase is like a PayPal Jr. for Bitcoin, I just am not going to ever deal with them in that regard. I can understand buying Bitcoin and then sending it away, but that's about it and that's half ass at best.
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:12:54
Amen brother. These people that are praising this don't even need to worry, they've never had a capital gain in their life I bet.
Fucking shills.

Not really fond of downloadable software.
Doesn't look like you are really trying to promote or even push this considering it's invitation only.
Downloadable Software + Bitcoin + Unknown = **SKETCHY**
Let sit for X amount of days until Y screams scam. If X &gt; 30 and Y != TRUE then proceed at your own risk.
Anytime you download software onto a computer you use Bitcoins with then you are pretty much leaving someone alone in a room with your wallet full of cash.
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:00:20
Needless to say, it does give confidence to beginning users and institutionalized traders as you suggested.
At least we have options, that's a bonus.
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:10:17
Yes, this is absolutely unacceptable to leak their source. They should be using an encrypted drop box (not sure the name of the OSS, but it's out there somewhere).
This is very careless and could have cost someone their career, affecting their family and all. Also not to mention the GAW minions will be targeting them next.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:36:58
You bullshit about all this PayCoin / PayBase shit but you were clearly one of the main ones pumping the hell out of it at the beginning. When it has **finally** became a **blatant** scam and could tarnish CCN's image worse than it already is *(I don't even know how this is possible at this point)* then you decide to take their advertisements down.
The rates you charge for advertising makes it quite obvious that you allow scammers to boost their schemes on your page. What kind of fucking legitimate company would even want to be on that shit show blog? 3,000 a month, really?
CCN is just as bad and maybe even worse than PayCoin or PayBase. They knowingly accept ill gotten gains and in return boost various scams. I have fucking lost count on how many damn scams you guys have advertised for which ended up costing many people thousands upon thousands of dollars.
You should be fucking ashamed of yourself.
Post your real world identity David Parker if you are so fucking righteous about your decision. You wouldn't fucking dare do it because you are a paid fucking shill. 
You would suck a dick if the price was right or even take it in the ass. Pathetic.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:52:19
Show us some transparency.
Are you willing to give that money back to all of the bagholders you created that were screwed because of your blatant conspiracy with PayCoin / GAW Miners?

OP: Take a small portion of your bitcoins, around 10% and place a short on OKCoin or an exchange of your choice with 10x leverage on the futures market. That is technically what these advanced market tools have been made for.
Just don't get carried away and speculate.
There are also other services such as: Locks by Coinapult that do this as well. It is cheaper to do it yourself as I suggested, but if you don't mind paying the fee feel free to check it out.

Or are you worried about legal implications for running a shit show promoting scam circus over there?

I understand what you mean, but we're coming to a point that if you are even using Bitcoin or known to use Bitcoin then you will be on **THE LIST**.
You don't want to be on **THE LIST**.

Society doesn't want people going against the established procedures that are already in place, especially when it comes to money and politics. Anyone that is making progressive moves or revolutionary changes will be labelled as an enemy.

Mycelium is definitely my GO-TO wallet, especially with then new HD Wallets.
You just simply cannot beat the ease of use with QR Code scanning to send funds. It's great just to scan a QR Code that's on your monitor or to send to someone else's phone. If you want to send funds with a Trezor you got to be like..
Step 1.) Locate Trezor
Step 2.) Plug cord in (Oh shit, you MUST have a PC nearby as well!)
Step 3.) DAMNIT, That's a charging cable and not a data cable (PS: They shipped me the wrong cable when I received my Trezor, wouldn't even work at first)
Step 4.) Go to website
Step 5.) Boot up your trezor, wait, yada yada. Hope you have the correct extensions installed
Step 6.) Copy address or whatever to send your funds
Step 7.) Hit send
Step 8.) Look back at your Trezor make sure looks good
Step 9.) Hit more buttons that are all switched around, takes a minute to think for a second
Step 10.) CONFIRMATION!!!!! Woooo, the fast super power of digital currency.
(PS: Trezor isn't bad in any way, just a hassle for everyday use. I believe in it's use for long-term storage, but honestly my uses of Bitcoin always has me moving and grooving my stash around)
We really need an Android Bitcoin Wallet that can push transactions via Bluetooth or somehow sign transactions offline and then air gap them someway. 
It would also be cool to be able to sign transactions via a NFC Key that you place close to your android phone. It would work as a watch-only wallet until you want to spend and then you just place your NFC Badge up to your phone and walla, it works and sends it.
I'm not going to lie, I bought a Trezor and I set it up then I never used it. I hated the idea of having to use a website, plus it took too much damn time to use.
It seems to me that you could easily maintain the same level with pen and paper and BIP32, BIP39 or whatever BIP that has HD Wallets.

I've followed this closely Bracek and I can't believe you've been stone walled this cold, he should at least tell you to fuck off if he's not going to pay you.
For future bitcoin dealings or transactions I'd suggest using Localbitcoins or some form of escrow. No one is a scammer until they scam, it's kind of scary out here.
