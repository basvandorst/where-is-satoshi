From which exchange you are buying? Does it has fees ? Is it trustable?
@_date: 2019-11-08 12:14:58
I agree ��
@_date: 2019-11-23 12:22:43
Not Europe so it doesn't feet my needs. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-11-26 12:38:17
Mining and wallets have nothing to do with crypto exchanges. 
Put your uncle or another relative to fix an account in coinbase or binance and withdraw from there the crypto to your hardware wallet (ladger nano x, trezor).
@_date: 2019-11-23 22:49:33
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:12:12
Nope i believe u r wrong. Transferring money eg from a European bank to coinbases bank takes 3 to 5 days to see the deposit in your coinbase account.
@_date: 2019-11-23 22:49:18
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:13:48
Use kraken or binance and you can buy with your credit card.
Or find an btc atm machine (though the rates are bad) and buy from there.
Do you have a wallet; If not you must fix one to store your btc. But so small amount i would leave it to the exchange.
@_date: 2019-11-23 07:34:08
Is gemini trustable and can it be used world wide? Can it accept sepa payments? Is it KYC?
@_date: 2019-11-06 18:09:18
Not true? I know if its true or not cause every time if i transfer money from my bank to coinbase bank account it takes as i said 3 to 5 days to see the fking money in. Whose fault is that i don't know not mine though.
@_date: 2019-11-23 12:26:30
Its not easy to do that if you have to make 10+ of those and KYC is needed.
So my other question is can i make more than one wallet in these exchanges
@_date: 2019-11-23 22:57:43
A friend of mine wants to put all his family 10 people to buy (any amount they want) btc. But he wants to know historically who gave him what amount. I told him that they can send money to the same bank account he sends money to buy btc (and put the same account reference he uses) and after transfer to a separate wallet or cold wallet for each member. Is this proper thinking?
@_date: 2019-08-07 07:39:49
Netcentric vs Coinbase Pro vs Binance vs Kraken?
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:52:13
Put someone else to buy it for you or use so many other open source wallets out there. Problem solved.
@_date: 2019-10-12 07:21:04
Can you run one with an RPi3 B+?  Oh well i will search the internet ����
@_date: 2019-10-03 06:03:10
I tried coinbase and binance and kraken and they have nice experience. But all of them have their minuses and pluses. Generally f....ng banks and govs make it hard to deposit money to any btc exchanges. 
I would try though a trezor and a ledger nano x.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:29:46
Yes bitcoin ATM machines. Sorry cant say which ones because then maybe i am accused for what i said before. Some known ones in Europe.
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:43:10
No Linux version? and not open source? I think I will pass.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:11:01

Everyone in for the profit for the money. BTC ATM companies don't give a shit about blockchain or btc. 
Well i am glad i found very early the lies they are selling and got out. Of course i am informing others for this.
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:07:55
NO ONE knows what will happen and everything you and others say are just speculations.
@_date: 2019-10-05 06:02:41
So what is the solution?
@_date: 2019-10-13 13:14:27
Thanks. I see though that are a lot of issues. 
Where (hw specs i mean) and what should i run to help the BTC and blockchain tech?
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:10:54
Really now winblows? No need to crack your program I will get in and ruin winblows so with that your prog too. Never ? Well I suppose time �� will show.
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:37:08
Why don't you share here how you did it? I mean the link ����

@_date: 2019-10-26 10:20:53
If you read history you will see even the common exchange with fiat money that exists today in the beginning it was the same and worse.
BTC is still in its veeery early stages until stability.
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:13:47
The only consideration In this is, that if something goes not go the good way, to be able to pay that loan.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:57:44
Binance, kraken, coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:53:37
The thing is what happens after ��. So again the ones that have are the privileged?
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:53:18
The companies behind them take most of the profit. You must have hundreds even thousands of transactions to have a benefit. They are speaking about big profits and numbers but the btc implementation at the moment is so small that all they say are for veeeeeeery future.
I tried 2,3 companies and for now they are a disappointment for the fast investment perspective.
@_date: 2019-10-11 07:27:01
I did business (bought their machines, rented them) and the fees and the transactions are just for laugh. You need to have more than 30 machines to have a clue of gain. They promise a lot of gains bla bla bla but in reality they are just scams.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:54:51
So here comes a big btc competitor with lots of backup in money and tech and user base and companies to promote.
So...xmmmm what ptoblems can it cause to btc?
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:55:26
There is a secure operating system and it's Linux. ��
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:33:35
With such small amount you won't make money but its a start.
1) Fix a coinbase account (there are alternatives binance,luno,etc.. but i would start with coinbase). Use sepa payments(transfer money from bank to their bank).
2) Use a wallet such Edge wallet (android) or trezor or ledger x  to transfer the coins. 
3) Keep safe your seed phrases and passwords.
4) READ READ READ READ GET EDUCATED about blockchain technology and btc generally.
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:02:49
Wouldn't it be better to tell him how or educate him? That would be better for btc adoption.
@_date: 2019-06-15 10:05:06
And use...?
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:22:25
What is the difference of an exchange eg binance or coinbase pro? Don't they have those metrics in there?
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:19:26
And why that it's better? Is it trust worthy? Is it secure? Fees etc...?
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:16:54
Its not only Greece. Corruption drives most of the countries. 
"Fighters" for the general good are a forgotten species unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:03:49
You could though search internet or coinbase faq itself.
@_date: 2019-04-18 19:09:06
I was referring to banks. 
We will not agree and I won't change your believes so I choose not to spend any more energy in this conversation.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:03:19
Greece doesn't have got even the basics in internet coverage and technology and you want them to adopt btc?
Companies have the biggest % of avoiding taxes and paying their employees shit and they treat them like shit. Also they work over hours without taking a single cent and government just don't give a shit! Until today no big company has been closed for this. Corruption is at its blossom.
Btc? Maybe soooooooome day in the far far far far distant future.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:29:47
Its still in development. Maybe later.
I will try:
Blockstream green,
@_date: 2019-04-22 11:33:06
Piece of shit are the companies providing it and the rates and fees the want. Also when you want to do business with them they are really very giving not so much info or statistics. Also difficult to find the owners of the machines. It's like they hiding something or from someone.
Generally most of them are like that.
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:53:34
Eventually i went with edge. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-03 04:49:13
So they are all sh....t. Thanks for the review. You could review coinbases wallet too ��.
@_date: 2019-04-29 12:06:25
Most of these ATMs have generally big fees and they are not trustable (eg try to find the owners ��). 
The ones that have a camera on the top notch of the machine are taking pic of the person the moment he/she starts to do transaction and storing them to "their" server (no gdpr compliance, no security measures at all, no retention policies). Who knows where are these pics and info are sold.
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:32:52
Ok. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:25:24
Thanks ��
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:15:38
Which one has less fees and is "more" secure? Or trustable I could say.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:36:02
Don't these market caps are shown inside these exchanges?
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:43:04
If the banks go away we would have saved our life time(a very important thing) trying to pay bills and expenses that they create and manipulate. They don't give a fck about u, u r a number for them.
So better to have a decentralized bank system and find ways to use less power to use block chain tech and try to protect nature more, THAN have those banks sucking your lifes work for pennies.
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:30:15
Most of these BC ATMs are not trust worthy. For eg some of them they have a camera and take a pic every time someone does a transaction. This picture is saved to their servers with NO protection at all NO GDPR compliance and retention/deletion policy. And when you try to find the owners you just will NEVER meet them but some one that will claim that works for them. Except that their fees are insane high.
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:12:17
Who said to find alternative energy? I said to spend less energy to produce or use bc. 
Banks use 10000000 times more energy, fraud, fake expenses, ghost investments etc... As it seems you like to give your money and life to them so do so, its your choice.
We choose BC.
@_date: 2019-04-26 08:56:05
How much this cost in energy bill?
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:11:52
Up down up down.... later stabilize with smaller up and downs like every economy or coin/money, because it will be the way how in future all world would be transacting.
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:09:18
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:33:49
No they don't consume energy (they destroy it with other means,oil,gas,chemicals,etc) they consume people's hard work and pay them shit.
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:09:07
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:06:30
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-09-22 08:29:08
To all to be aware.
I have searched and interacted and tried to do business with some of these of kind btc atm companies but i assure you. The fees they give you is just for a laugh and the quantity of machines they need/you need to have any kind of profit is crazy and insane. The numbers they tell you about buyings or sellings from the machine are not in this world. They speak about thousands of btc or dollars every day/month transactions that its not possible to achieve for now at least. They will surely not tell you statistics (buy/sell) of their machines. Most of them use Kraken. The only people that truly gain is the machine providers and the distributor. All others gain nothing in compare.
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:09:19
Why wait 2 weeks? Register to an exchange (coinbase pro,kraken,binance) and buy btc, easy as that. U can use with coinbase PayPal too. Or to the other places the other suggested.
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:32:55
Binance i believe
@_date: 2019-09-28 12:43:00
First of all online wallets are not secure and not your keys not your coins. So use a local wallet eg like electrum to your computer. For your mobile mycelium.
Exchanges coinbase (offers mobile wallet too), binance, kraken. ( Buying and selling places )
Or ledgers like trezor or ledger nano x to store your coins.
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:14:39
I have the exact question. Can someone answer with details please. Because a business man friend of mine says bitcoin started like something else but is now a place only for people to transfer money secretly. And that no one knows who is transferring what.
How to explain him and convince him its not like that?
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-09-10 06:47:15
Firstly learn to use linux. After pgp. Done.

Kraken, coinbase, binance
@_date: 2019-09-29 20:42:52
NO you can't. Forget about it. Or invest buying or play at the btc exchanges to gain.
@_date: 2019-09-07 06:19:53
Coinbase offer a mobile wallet so its his coins if they are transfered there. The reliability and security of the app though is another thing ��
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:52:55
There is no such thing as unlimited data plan. If you read the small letters you will see that there is a limit.

Yea and it's price is out of their mind! Are they crazy or something? Buy a ledger with Max 150 $ or € and you are more than fine + buy a nice watch with another 150 and the rest 9200 buy btc.
Really they are aiming to stupids or to rich ppl that don't know what to do their money.

It would be nice to earn even a small amount of btc for running a node continually for eg 3, 6, 12, months.
Well I will try to run one to my RPi3 ��. I hope this helps btc to become a standard.
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:47:31
The moment we speaking it's worth 8000$ so your comment is irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:31:30

Xaxaxxaxaxxa nice xaxaxaxaxa
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:18:28
Other choices are coinbase or binance or kraken
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:54:24
Why ?
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:25:07
Yep of course it can not be full stopped with the tech and knowledge now exist. Maybe later things will change
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:02:12
What OTC means?
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:45:31
U didn't tell us how much you won though
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:57:58
The question was not what you will do with the two different currencies BUT which one you would choose.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:06:01
Is running a node easy?
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:08:14
That's not a lot. A lot is millions or billions if u count world.
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:56:54
You are comparing wrong things. And secondly come and say that again here when 1btc will go xmmmm let's say 10000 or 20000 or who knows. You don't like it don't buy it don't use it, stay in your fiat money world.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:51:25
Or better lubuntu or MX18 or pure Debian ��
And how that helps Bitcoin ? Do I have any benefits running a node? Am I responsible about something or just install run and forget? Maybe an update and that's it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:21:40
What will happen when all 21M will be mined?
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:59:26
Why, do securities exist in Bitcoin ? Sorry got confused ��.
Is LBTC in par with BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:14:33
Yes there is. Education.
And yes there are very good ways to store pass and NEVER forget or loose them. Educate your self a bit on that. An eg. a good password manager backuped daily at your NAS and from there encrypted with eg cryptomator to a cloud storage or a rock solid material with pass written on it and more than 50km away somewhere safe.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:35:30
And why not just use an exchange coinbase,binance,etc...? 
Or use a localbitcoin seller or a bitcoin atm?
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:07:15
That's bad and that's Monopoly if it stays like that and the number rise towards those 1000+ only people, institutions, investors,...
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:01:02
Sorry but do securities exist in btc world? What effect has this to BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:47:39
How many ASICs needed to be profitable? Let's say you have cheap electricity and most of the months from 10 to -10 , -20 celcius.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:34:33
Learn to be patient and you could buy 1000x5 from coinbase or go coinbase pro ��
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:26:00
It's sooner than you think.
Yours are a far far future.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:47:35
The question is. Where all that fiat money go when you buy btc ?��
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:42:55
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:48:38
Not BTC? You are uneducated go learn and read about blockchain tech.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:34:33
Now do a good thing and explain fees ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:48:09
That I know ��
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:43:14
How u know they are hard earned?
