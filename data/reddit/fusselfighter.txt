yeah it seems like you can great value for selling your Bitcoin in Venezuela ;) 
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:05:55
No altcoins my friend ;) the article says: "On Tuesday, it will open up to new currencies, accepting deposits in US dollars, euros and Polish zloty."
@_date: 2014-07-29 10:02:40
@_date: 2014-07-29 10:03:30
yep. Venezuela is pretty f*** up.....
@_date: 2014-08-24 17:47:32
And that's why they also have a QR printed on the card ;) So it's basically a business card + USB + QR + NFC. I personally think it's pretty cool and would work well if you want to give BTC away at weddings or something. 
People on have this horrible tendency to bad-mouth everything that is not perfect. Chill, I'm not saying that you should use these as your cold storage :) 
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:48:54
Too late man.... :( Now this whole thing has already extended to pretty much everyone and is not focused on celebrities anymore. My FB timeline is FULL with people emptying buckets of ice water over their heads.

My post was certainly not intended to show that we are superior in any way so apologies if that's the vibe you got from it. The context I gave above is commonly accepted and based on research so far.
Do your friends use Bitcoin or are you the only one? In my friend circle there are only about 2-3 people who have Bitcoin. Everyone else is kinda interested but not willing to invest 'real' money into this 'trend'....
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:12:23
haha yeah don't worry about it. I'm not in Vzela :) Again, this is for a friend of mine who wants to pay uni and needs USD. 
If the market is dry, wouldn't it make sense though to go through BTC just for the purpose of liquidity? I understand that its riskier, but also probably easier to get a larger amount of BTC &gt; USD no?
Btw. how do you know so much about this? Are you directly affected? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:50:47
great site, thanks for letting me know :) 
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:59:11
Yeah try  They are located in Kreuzberg which is known to be the Bitcoin area, so you should be able to get some food and other stuff as well. 
EDIT: Try  as well :) Single rooms start from 37 Eur per night ;) 
Would have offered you to stay at my place but I'm not in Berlin atm. Hope you enjoy your stay anyway :) Berlin is the best city ever :)

The bitcoin fund look like an interesting idea.  I'm curious to see how they are going to pull it off. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:00:05
Same here! Bitcoin has changed my understanding of money, governments, politics, economics and much more. I wish more millennials would understand that these things are way to important than to be left to experts. Most of it is common sense and Bitcoin is just another way of making the system better, fairer and cheaper overall.
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:59:06
Thanks for adding me to your contest :) It would be great to have a comprehensive table overview of all the exchanges in the different regions. Not sure if that exists already? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:27:26
That's the official exchange rate. The black market rate easily exceeds it by up to 16x. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 05:57:22
Wtf is wrong with you? ... 
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:39:22
Hey, 
If you want to transfer from EUR to GBP without going through BTC I would highly recommend you to use **transferwise.com**. I have used them so many times and saved loads of money on fees. By going through them you save yourself the stupid bank fees and a lot of time that you would waste on going through the different BTC exchanges/meet-ups. 
If you do NEED/WANT to go through BTC I would suggest you go through an exchange for larger amounts while utilizing localbitcoin for everything &lt; 100GBP.
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:05:52
Totally understandable, I'm not attacking him in anyway :)
I'm just trying to figure out if its better to exchange VEF &gt; BTC &gt; USD or if going through the black market directly would actually give a better value. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:44:08
What I meant was: 1st G &gt; Mt. Gox, etc, 2nd G &gt; what we have now ;) 
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:15:33
Totally agree with all your points ;) and by luck my friend is really talented and could actually do all these things. 
However in order to pay his university all these things won't bring in enough money on time which means (by the looks of it) he would still need to take the route through the black market and just buy dollars directly. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 06:20:53
BOOM! ;)
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:36:58
I see. Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:09:16
49697.80 VEF = 13.60 BTC at the current market rate....... is that really the "best deal"?
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:58:57
Will let her know, but as I said earlier I rather show her how simple it is by using a QR code than explain her how the app works. I need to ease her into this :) 
@_date: 2014-07-19 10:15:35
If there is ONE thing Bitcoin lacks it's skilled marketeers and people that have a good understanding of PR. 
Standing together on this issue with other crypto currencies is not a sign f weakness, it's a sign of strength. Both communities are different yes, but that doesn't mean we can not help each other. My respect to you @_date: 2014-08-27 15:32:00
To be honest, the app is just in general slow and not well designed. 
I was a couple of weeks ago in a pub and wanted to pay with Bitcoin, but didn't realise that I had to wait almost 4 min for the app to 1)check for updates, 2)download the blockchain (I had full 3G connection). If that's how it works, how am I supposed to convince people that its' 'fast and easy" to use Bitcoin?! My friends phone battery actually died in the middle of the process although he had 5% left..... The guy in the bar just laughed and laughed... that's not a great user experience at all...
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:20:00
I know that localbitcoin is great usually but in Venezuela the deals are **BAD**: 
So for example looking at this local listing:  
1 BTC is sold for 50749.12 VEF which equals 8065.02$ at the current official exchange rate. In other countries one could buy **13.89 BTC** with that money!!!
Some offers on localbitcoin offer BTC for dollar or other currencies but the point is that there doesn't seem to be a way to get a good deal using VEF which is the only easily attainable currency in Venezuela.  
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:28:47
I missed the talk Miguel Octavio but I guess people could just keep the VEF in cash? I mean how do the sellers on localbitcoin deal with this issue? They seem to be thriving by selling 1 BTC for the value of almost 14 BTC! 
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:28:44
Just wondering: Is there a way to have see the BTC GBP price as well? I tried btcgbp=x but it didn't work. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:56:38
mmmmmh I see what you mean... so what would you suggest then?
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:05:15
Gosh, I hope they are as good as I think they are :) BTC UK to da moon! 
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:29:42
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:59:19
Can you suggest one in the UK? I'm not super up-to-date on that topic.

Thanks for passing by today and enjoy your new hat! :) I'm the daughter :)
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:12:14
Thanks Penny, the way you suggested is perfectly fine and would work, HOWEVER the point of my post is that there doesn't seem to be a good way to get BTC through VEF directly. 
Oh and thanks for clarifying the friend relationship between me, Google and NSA ;) 
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:19:56
yeah I just checked out their website and it looks a little bit fishy.... any other ideas?
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:07:43
yeah I figured, the discussion here has been really useful :) 
What do you think, would you get more value/the same value if you exchange VEF &gt; BTC &gt; USD in comparison to going directly through the black market to buy USD?
@_date: 2014-07-11 10:36:13
nice write-up. It might not be 100% perfect, but these sort of articles will pave the way for Bitcoin to go mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 10:59:22
She has a BB so unfortunatelly no Bitcoin app yet.... She will have a QR code that can be scanned in though. I wanted to make it as easy as possible for her. One step at a time ;) 
@_date: 2014-07-12 14:00:32
Yeah Max is pretty great. Sometimes a little but too aggressive but great nevertheless. I started following  and find their opinions a bit more balanced...
See I wonder why some of us are really into Bitcoin but fail to excite our friends about it. Is it because we are interested in economics or monetary systems or new technologies? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:02:45
you are 100% right of course. :)

Yeah I wish we could move a little faster towards a unified method of proving that solvency. I have seen different methods of audits so far and think that's part of the problem as well. For people who are relatively new to Bitcoin and are trying to choose a trustworthy exchange all these reports must be super confusing.....

As I said earlier, I'm not in Venezuela but asking for a friend here. I'm not 100% what the current black market value is at the moment but I know that it fluctuates greatly depending on the season, political situation, etc. etc. 
Fact is that Bitcoin would help many people to defend themselves from this daylight robbery that is taking place through the government and the black market. In this particular case it would help someone to pay his university.
What I'm trying to understand is: There is a clear need for Bitcoin in Venezuela! Why is it not flourishing like in many other countries? Why doesn't there seem to be a easy and affordable way to buy Bitcoin at a 'normal' price? Has the Venezuelan government found a way to shut down Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-03 15:25:32
Love the idea! :)  Don't forget to add Coinfloor as an online exchange for the UK. 
Also, you might want to make it a little bit more clear which markets these exchanges work in. So instead of putting up the flags, currency signs would make more sense. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:36:10
It's totally worth it :) for me it was kind of an outer world experience the first time I did it. My smile was so big that the barista probably though I had gone insane haha

marketeer here :) 
Agree with you, but also agree with that redditmight be the wrong place to get anything started haha
Loved the idea of Bitpay sponsoring a baseball game, and there was this other guy once on here who marks fiat notes with a Bitcoin sign or sassy comments. 
I also think that the ChangeTip movement has had a great impact on the community and is continuing to bring people into the fold. 
What Bitcoin really needs to become mainstream is not really a marketing campaign, it needs to get easier. Buying, selling and actually doing something with it is still to hard (we are getting there though). 
So to summarize, marketing (of some sorts) is happening, but I think we are not 100% ready yet :) 
Give it 6-12 month and I would be more than happy to help to put something together. 
PS: If you are looking for inspiration on how to make a currency go "viral" have a look at dodge coin. People here don't have a high regard for their community, but they have achieved fame with a doggy coin. Just saying. ;)
