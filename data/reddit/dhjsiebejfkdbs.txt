When dogs were originally domesticated from wolves thousands of years ago, they were bred for one ultimate purpose: to protect their humans at all costs. Imagine you enter the home of some bitcoin tycoon hoping to get them to cough up their private keys. Suddenly you are confronted by 7 Adult Cane Corsos. That’s about 850 LBS of pissed off pure muscle with teeth and jaws that can chew through Leather in seconds. No way would I want to fuck with that for any kind of money but then again I’m not a crook or a bitcoin tycoon.
