Are you employing people to help with marketing?  This is a great product, and the public (both retailers and customers) needs help understanding.  You've gone a long way making the hardware familiar, and I'm hoping merchants will trust the Coinkite process.

Based on what, exactly?  I'm just curious. =)
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:55:27
Yep, and still no reply.  However, you can hardly blame them.  I bet they got cold feet when they realized that, basically, their head is on a chopping block in this thread.

This feels so good. Remember the first time you heard about the original 10,000BTC pizza?  Did you calculate how much that would be worth today?  Someone will be doing that about yours in the future, even though you only paid .002BTC. It's not the same, by any means, but it still feels good.  And tastes good, too.  SnapCard just won my vote.

Great idea, very supportive.

Maybe I'm not reading the question correctly, but I'm pretty sure the Coinbase app for android will let you scan a paper wallet's QR. From there, the btc will be in the Coinbase online wallet until sent anywhere else. Is that what you had in mind for "sweep paper wallet to phone?"
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:05:05
May I ask, what demographic are these clients?
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:26:53
Ok, I've been reading up on 51% attacks all day, and **this** answered my questions.  Thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-12 23:19:01
I love that we even need this now.   =)
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:30:43
Don't worry, .  I understood, and I appreciate your efforts to clear the confusion.  As someone who actually consults the tax code when I have a question about filing, I understand exactly where you are coming from. It's just nice to know you're offering your expertise to boost my confidence that I'm interpreting it correctly. I've read many of your posts: they're helpful, concise, and clear in my opinion. Thanks!

@_date: 2014-02-18 16:49:35
I understood you. Upvote for providing perspective, even if others didn't catch it.  You weren't bashing all electronics Newegg sells, just that they were using bitcoin disinformation to cash in on people who don't understand that mining is not as profitable as it was last year.

I had a scary thought..  Facebook creates its own altcoin, let's call it Facecoin, and basically positions itself to be the only tipping mechanism allowed through their site.  Someone reassure me this would never happen, please?
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:27:59
so can coinbase, and for that matter, Bitcoin Core...
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:57:27
I like your optimism, m'am.

Thank you, both of you, for discussing this rationally.  I am acutely aware of how increasingly difficult it is for the general public to problem solve using math (another barrier to widespread bitcoin adoption rarely discussed).  I believe more than a few new users who came to reddit to understand bitcoin will benefit from this thread.  My cute hat off to you both. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:57:39
I wonder how many of the 150 pizzas have been ordered so far...  Brilliant marketing strategy.  For about $3000, they win over ~150 new customers.
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:24:29
I did, thank you!  
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:38:28
Be careful. There is .schildbach in the address, a name associated with lost coins on another android app.  I may be overly cautious, but it's worth a look.
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:53:18
Although, as a BTC owner/user that has no knowledge of how to code, I have similar thoughts as this guy. Personally, I don't know *how* to help, and I am wishing for the same things as he is. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:46:11


She didn't say that.  She only said the law was broad enough to include things like bitcoin and that certain government agencies (IRS, FinCen) don't have the power to define money laundering laws.  Did you read the article or the title of the article?
Your idea is very thought-provoking, nonetheless. I agree, there needs to be new law drafted to address the unique nuances of bitcoin as it functions as digital currency.  I agree, we should at least start with a formal definition and go from there.  Having said that, I also think there is merit in testing it out as an asset, etc. in order to make a more informed decision.

Once I wrapped my brain around this, it seemed like a short glimpse into the future =/

then I take it back, it's a feature. =)

I did the exact same thing.

That picture of the Hatian pre-teen with GoogleGlass holding a token of cryptocurrency.  This.  If the volunteerism/charity/whatever-created-this-opportunity continues, our future will see a classless tech culture we are only now beginning to realize. I can't stop staring at this picture.

Isn't that the same thing as asking them to forfeit a huge chunk of their profits?  I think its bit more than a feature, anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:10:29
I cannot upvote this enough. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:38:16
I'm not an attorney, but no.  You only need to report the gains (or losses) realized when you spend them.  For instance, say last summer you bought 1 BTC for $100 USD.  You hold on to it until today, when the price is around 1 BTC for $450 USD.  Since your 1 BTC is more valuable now, there is a gain equal to $350 upon spending that 1 BTC today.  The IRS tax laws are saying that you must report that $350 capital gain to the IRS when you file your 2014 taxes next year.  You wouldn't need a Form 1099 (which doesn't apply to capital gains), but would instead simply report it when you answer the question on your Form 1040 that asks if there was any "Other income not previously reported" elsewhere on the form.  Similarly, you may be eligible for tax credit/deductible should bitcoin tank completely and you spent the 1 BTC when it was valued at less than $100.  I'm less certain about claiming capital losses, and I suspect the IRS is as well.  At any rate, I hope that helps. =)

Ripple uses BOINC, just what you described
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:45:23
How does that even happen?
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:56:35
You have to follow the instructions on the link:  join snapcard, they handle the ordering and payment, you get a screamin deal of a cheese pizza for .002 BTC which they pull from the wallet you associate with your snapCard account.

Cash advance, then [localbitcoins.com](  There's the drawback at paying interest for the advance, but it's the easiest way I can imagine.

I wish I was in your local area.  I'd buy, trade, barter for those coins! I'll be so excited to get my first bitcoin, but I just haven't found the best way to start...  Mining isn't profitable, but I just want to see something other than a 0.00 balance!
