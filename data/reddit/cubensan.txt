Depends what you are talking about. The supply of transaction space is roughly 6mb/h. The mempool is the broadcasted demand for transaction space.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:34:54
Since coinbase pays the users tx fee through gdax they are not distributing the cost. They are taking the cost themselves which is terribly expensive. Problem is they have operated for many years and segwit addresses came into existence last summer. Their funds are not in segwit addresses and therefore can't use batching to reduce fees. If they moved all their funds to segwit addresses the whole network would be congested far more than it is today.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:29:42
Fine, but that is wrong. A transaction takes up space, so adding one transaction will increase size. Five transactions could be smaller than one, so relative size and efficiency can be improved. But adding more transactions ultimately leads to more space being used.

No one prior to him made that claim though. His remark was equally far away from making sense. You are the only one talking about number of transactions. You and lupus are the only ones talking about mempool being any form of supply. 
 
No one with any clue would make the claim that the mempool is the supply of anything. But clearly a limited supply of transaction space will increase the mempool given sufficient transaction demand. More transactions leads to more space being used, similar to how more glasses of water takes more space. It's also true that the number of glasses of water is not equal to the volume of water.

No joke intended. Those are the real cons. Anything with practical use will keep up with inflation, anything that's also scarce will outperform inflation. Shiny + scarce is valuable. Can live in + scarce is valuable.  
.  
The pro is also true. If it does not become practical to use then we lack an important part of what makes things valuable. If crypto disrupts the economy by becoming the next major medium of exchange then it will be the most useful thing in society, while also becoming one of the most scarce resources around. If that happens the winning cryptos will be extremely valuable - which seems to be your main concern.

Mempool and fees are growing while volume is much lower than early this summer - judging from following coinmarketcap. Unless someone is paying millions per day, how exactly is it spam?

Sounds like you have never been investing before. Start with a plan of what you can reasonably save from your disposable income. The more the better for your future. If you are trying crypto for the first time, buy a trezor or a ledger nano. Buy top 10 crypto currency that are supported and send them to your hardware wallet every week. For stocks buy index funds, they have the lowest fees and the most reliable returns.  
.  
Never skip on your weekly or monthly deposit, and don't touch it or trade it. Every time you touch it you incur fees. Keep a level head and ride out waves.  
.  
As you do this your commitment will rise and you will read more about crypto and stocks. At this point you can start buying single company shares or go heavier into specific cryptos. This is also a time to reflect on your portfolio. LTC is a top ten and you now have some if you followed my advice. If you now realize you do not believe in the project after reading the white paper, change it to something you do believe in. Never underestimate diversity though. Don't take specific advice from anyone. No one knows which crypto will do best or which stock will. I think Dash is the single best future bet, why? Because I'm biased as fuck, partly because I love the tech, partly because I'm heavily invested, partly because I've gained a lot already.

Best of luck

Most adults are in debt, so having €50 per month to spend is actually more than most adults have. Adults spend money they don't have on investments they can't afford to lose.

Core had nothing to do with the creation of bitcoin, if you really mean what you say you should be of the belief that core should start a new coin. That's not how it works and not how it's supposed to work. There are different visions for how to go forward and currently core has the largest following, but competing ideas shouldn't fork off. Bch did because lots of people considered segwit a very bad development and didn't want to have that irreversible change on their chain. Other than that the protocol will be stronger if we have more camps promoting good ideas.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:22:42
BCH wanted to solve a real problem, and it did. In no way shape or form did BCH damage the reputation of BTC. If BTC can't handle competition even with an overwhelming community support and an extreme market lead that's due to the shortcomings of BTC, not the fault of competition.  
  
Blaming competitors for your failure is irresponsible, yet that's all BTC has been doing for the last year. Everything is an attack on bitcoin. It used to be forking, then mining, now selling. SELLING Bitcoin is an attack on Bitcoin. Several top posts from this sub in the last couple of days is saying exactly this. This is the same thing the media has been doing with terrorism since 2011. The act of not being a BTC Hodler is now considered being an attacker.

Linear = any increment on the graph is the same as the same increment anywhere else in the graph.  
 
Logarithmic = you multiply values going up. Ex, for each notch going up you double the value. Instead of adding numbers going up you multiply them.  
  
Why? Because this is how all life works. Each couple gets 4 offspring then you double the population every generation. It's fast to go from one million to two million people, but its very slow to go from 2 people to one million.  
 
Back to the graph, in linear form it seems we are growing faster and faster, but when you look at the the Logarithmic scale you get a linear representation of growth, which you can clearly see is slowing down.  
 
Edit: logarithmic scales can take different bases, convention for most applications is base 10,or an order of magnitude. This means each notch represent a ten fold increase.

I want to know how much the network would be used if the mempool wouldn't start growing every time people try to use the network. I don't use it any more, I suspect a lot of people don't. But wouldn't it be cool to see how far we would be along right now if people didn't abandon using it?

Changing subject, yeah, this was a joke people took too seriously. You are mostly arguing Gresham's law is correct, and I agree. But arguing people will reduce spending because of deflation isn't as straight forward as people think. When people buy stocks it's considered spending, when people save a deflationary currency it's not considered as an action, even though it's equally valuable. You also talk about costs associated with different assets. Crypto is global, I'm not in the US and our tex situation is severely different. Some places have no cap gains tax, so the argument is only valid where the system has artificial constraints. In a global market we need to discuss on merit, not by individual regions strange codes.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:29:19
No. The weird thing to do is to cash out everything you have. That's a mentality you should be past at college age. If you buy 100 BTC at $1, then it's actually really strange to sell ALL of them at $70. I mean sure, you made $7000 on a $100 investment, but isn't $5k enough to cash out and then save $2k and see where it goes?

To all the haters, little or no real wealth is created without some leverage. It's far better to invest in rental property than to repay the debt. Even index funds are a superior bet. If op can hodl a job like he can hodl btc, then why risk the upside of btc for repayment of a loan that he can repay with his salary? Student loans isn't cancer, you can live with it fine if you studied something worth studying.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:18:59
I'm past that age myself and have never really been a fan of being in debt, but have taken on debt for rental property. My parents didn't do higher education, and few people in that generation did. The student debt situation in the US is atrocious, and since they are are paying for college I think it should be avoided for the vast majority of people there. My point with student loans is that most places they have very good terms. If you have a house and need to take a loan to buy a car, get a mortgage on the house and pay the car, don't get a car loan because the interest is insane.
However, if my parents did get a student loan to buy a house they would have done great. House prices are up 100 - 1000x in my are since then.

That's a good analysis and a reasonable justification for a shitty system. But...  
  
Stocks: when you buy stocks you contribute nothing unless you buy it from the company. It's no different from trading crypto or fiat currencies.  
  
Bonds: you are providing debt, a practice that's very hyped but maybe not so good as it's made out to be.  
  
Savings: worst of the worst. You give banks a higher base for their fractional reserve lending. The problem here is that a person with $1MM can't buy a fairly priced house at $1MM because a person with $300k can out compete you with a loan. The loan btw is how mony is created, so you aren't increasing value, you are increasing price. And you are doing it by increasing the cost for consumers to buy homes. It's just malicious imo, but it does increase gdp.

Yes, it's rational, it's also rational to save your fiat in other investments. Actually come to think of it, that's a fundamental problem with stocks, bonds and savings.  /s
  
Making money over time is not a fundamental problem, but somehow society has become convinced this is the case. Billionaires making 10% a year as roi isn't seen as a problem, but if the working class makes a return by being more cautious about what they buy and what they save we have a huge problem. What? Why? Well because if the working class stops buying junk there is no 10% to be made for the billionaire.

In macroeconomy the endowment doesn't matter for spending, so in the economy, assuming modern economics is correct, the same money will be spent for those things and the same will be left for savings. There is no need to make a distinction between asset classes, it's just a way to make language easier. There are cashlike assets that increase in value. Bonds can be bought and sold quickly too, just about as fast as moving money from a normal account to an account connected to a payment card. With deflation people save in currency, that's the only difference, and on a grander scale that means a smaller portion of the money supply is in circulation,and you have to adjust velocity calculations accordingly.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:01:59
I agree completely, though I don't think the problem is the loans per se, but rather taking on costs you can't handle. Loans should only be taken when the thing you buy will generate is own cost plus interest. This could be a car if it takes you to a job you couldn't go to otherwise. A home that appreciates in value. An investment. Or even an education if it can generate a higher income than it costs, or give you a job which will bring you far more satisfaction in life. Problem is 4 years of living like a clown costs a lot of money, and education in the US is unrealistically expensive.  
  
Let's say you pay 80k for college, incur costs of living at another 40k, and your opportunity cost is 160k (40k per year is avg income if my memory is correct). 280k for college is insane. If that was invested in real estate, crypto, stocks, bonds, art, precious metals or something else you would possibly be pretty well off, but a fucking diploma? In art history?

You are talking short term. If inflation decrease they do make higher real profits, assuming people can repay the debt owed. But their business is thriving because everyone is in debt, even people who don't need it. With deflation the loan model doesn't work and people wouldn't leverage against loans. Loans are given against a fractional reserve, so money is created by giving loans. When people take less loans they make less money since they create less of it.

He didn't win the lottery, it wasn't luck and he's certainly not attacking bitcoin or you. He's a public figure and some of the btc adoption we see today can be directly attributed to him. He is of the belief that we need to have cheap transactions at all times to have a growing demand for btc, and I agree with that. Bitcoin is amazing, but right now it's working so poorly that I can't showcase it to other people. I haven't promoted BTC to anyone since this summer because I don't want to look like a fool. I still promote cryptocurrency, but I showcase Dash now. Could do it with bch, ltc, eth, etc, xmr or something else, but what I'd really like to do is showcase BTC. Last time I showed it I paid a dollar to send a dollar, now the dude can't even spend it.  
  
We need people like me too. I'm not a public figure, I don't promote on social media, but there are at least 10 people invested in BTC because of me. That's 10:1 adoption rate over a few years. More that's not happening with me nor any one else from that time. Being able to transact has always been the number one thing for me and many others to. A blocksize increase would have solved it and allowed for continued adoption while LN is being worked out.

If no other parameters in the economy changes but you deflate the fiat currency of that nation then you most likely end up with a tremendous problem in the next couple of decades. It is NOT a fact that an economy performs poorly when there are assets that increase in value, nor is it a fact that an economy can't work with a deflationary currency. There isn't much room for lenders in deflationary scenarios, so the people who control the economy ends up in a bad place. It's even possible that businesses who depend on inflation and are powerful enough to push the economic narrative are in fact swaying public opinion in their favor.

I think you mean God. You don't seem to comprehend basic finance. Are you saying it's a bad idea to get a loan on your house? Is it a bad idea to take a loan to start a business? Is it a bad idea to take loans to flip houses? Is it a bad idea to take a loan to invest in index funds? Is it a bad idea to take a loan to start a real estate empire? Is it a bad idea to take a loan to buy bitcoin?  
  
All of the above involve risk and all of the above are great ideas under the right circumstance. What history has shown is that the people who invested in bitcoin was right. Taking a huge loan, even with 100% yearly interest to buy bitcoin turned out to be a great idea. Most people didn't think so, but some did.   
  
In many countries the loan payments are almost free for student loans, where I live it's common practice to live with your parents while doing higher education for free and taking the maximum possible student dept and put it in a savings account or in an investment like an index fund. Since it's the best loan you can get you want as much of it as possible for when you buy a house or start a business.  
 
If you never invest, never take risk, then you probably are a debt slave, or you don't own your home and you are instead a wage slave, which is the same thing.

Selling BTC or buying alts = Financial attack to slow down Bitcoin adoption. Does this include fiat? When Large corporations buy USD is that an attack on Bitcoin? Or is the rule that it has to be listed on Coinmarketcap and be done by a high profile crypto enthusiast?  
  
Also if I could get some clarification on Cyberwarfare. If I spam transactions but I do it to stresstest, then since my goal is not to slow down the network but rather to test it, is that not warfare? Is it just the intention, or is it the action of slowing down the network? Like, if you spam the network with hundreds of thousands of transactions and putting up 7 million dollars in fees, could that be considered warfare? If there are lots of people that all want to use their coins is that collective warfare? I'm just confused.  
  
Like, gaining control over a major bitcoin community is a hybrid attack on bitcoin. Just control, like being an admin is an attack. You don't have to have bad intention, do anything, in fact you could be promoting bitcoin and help mass adoption and it would still be considered an attack on bitcoin.

If you are solvent enough to take out a larger loan on your house it means your finances are solid. It's no different to take your savings and put them into crypto than it is to take a loan and invest in crypto. The crypto is not collateral, the house is, so any value in the house is your savings. If crypto goes bad then you have less savings, same as anyone who didn't take a loan.  
.  
If you have a solid income, own a house, and have enough equity in it to take out more loans, then investing in anything with a higher expected return than the interest in the loan is a solid shortcut to retirement. It's not without risk, but if you are OK with having to work to make up for it later, then there isn't much downside.

Increased cost of loans means there are less loans, which means less competition for high priced items such as housing, meaning housing costs are lower. Also there are visa cards such as TenX. You can buy groceries for your btc anywhere.

1. People keep transacting.  
2. Less people are transacting with btc.  
3. Therefore people must be transacting with something else.  
.  
It matters because we want bitcoin to be successful. Me and a lot of people consider widespread usage to be part of that definition.

Cool, hadn't seen that, but I like it. I'm profiting from both chains but btc is a speculation on LN and is unable to handle growing demand currently. I would love for LN to be as amazing as its made out to be by the community pushing it, and in time we'll get the result. But I don't want to wait years and give the fiat market that much more time to organize against crypto. I want bitcoin to scale now and on board more people with fast transactions and low fees, and right now my bitcoin can do that on two chains. One of which can handle a lot more active users, and one is entirely useless as a means of transacting from time to time.  
.  
Paper dollars and electronic dollars are not the same either, but we call them both dollars. One is made peer to peer, one is a settlement layer called banking.

If people aren't transacting it's a problem. I'm no longer transacting on btc, the poster you replied to isn't, lots of people aren't transacting anymore. Bitcoin is pretty small for a world wide product and losing users is a bad sign. But it seems you think transacting is a fringe use case or you would have understood the problem in the initial comment.

Just last week Ver was criticized for not buying enough bch, that he is a fake for not actually committing to move to bch and exit btc. Now he is pumping bch apparently. People are too obsessed with celebrities and what they do, but half dozen people can't keep manipulating for very long. If you are right the people you mention will be broke in a few months, great theory there.

Econ, as presented during a bachelor's degree would disagree with what you are saying. The original endowment doesn't matter in any model I've used. People can spend or save, if they save in their savings account, bitcoin, stocks, funds or bonds doesn't really matter. When there is inflation people don't want to save in that medium, so they spend, either on consumer goods, or they spend on savings. With deflation, either you spend on consumer goods, spend on savings, or simply save the medium directly.  
.  
Can you find a study that suggests people will change their habits with changing rates of inflation? I think changes are observable during hyper inflation, but in that scenario any consumption is an investment since even perishable goods are better stores off value.

In monotheism people believe in one faith, hence the name monotheism. Maybe you consider bitcoin a monotheistic cult, but I certainly don't. I'm part of the bitcoin community, which includes btc and bch, and to some extent certain alts.

It's not resolved, fewer transactions isn't a solution, it's a problem. I used to use btc, send to friends and such to demo the platform. After paying 1-2$ fee enough times I now demo Dash or Bch instead. I like to give people a dollar or two so they can test the tech, those fees are unreasonable for that. You can argue that there are times where fees are lower, but really, unless btc can show consistently low fees over a couple of months the problem hasn't gone away.

It's a protocol, it wants nothing. Name a currency other than crypto with exponential purchasing power. People and corporations like money, as the value increase there is more wealth to be spent and merchants will be more inclined to tap in to the market.

There is a miner fee associated with every transaction, but that fee isn't regulated, it's chosen by you and is collected by anyone willing to secure the network, including you. Most people purchase crypto on a speculative basis and go through an exchange to do this. The exchange facilitates peer to peer transactions on THEIR platform, not on the blockchain. On the exchange you trade ious and they take a cut, very similar to banking. Crypto can be handled like cash, and you can find a trade anywhere with anyone, but people are scammers and people don't want to deal with that so they take the fee and risk of not owning your own assets at the exchange instead. The same reason we started using banks in the first place. The main difference is really cool though, once you have bought your crypto you no longer need the exchange or a bank at all. If you are paid in crypto from work you don't need a bank account or an exchange at all. (assuming you find a way to buy stuff for your crypto)

Because it's a likely candidate for being the future of money, in which case you don't want to get out in the foreseeable future, just like the sun won't run out in the foreseeable future. Your argument hinges on bitcoin being useless as a medium of exchange, his argument requires it to be useful.

Hostile takeover? Purchasing 50% shares? In what company? Lots of people want larger blocks and segwit in one package, not to takeover anything but rather because the current path is not in line with their philosophy and they want their coins to continue being useful. If you haven't noticed there are lots of people who like big blocks, so it's a difference of opinion, not an attack.

It's a decreasing function as you can see on a log scale of bitcoin price over time. When supply is limited this is a sign of increased demand and since purchasing power is increasing at a decreasing rate it is telling of the potential for stability in the long term. Increasing purchasing power of money is very bad in most models taught in the west, but you have to ask the question; for whom is it bad? Certainly not for the people who choose to have it, it's bad for the institutions that create money, it's bad for tax collectors, it's bad for lenders. At least two of those should not exist in its current form and the other should be severely reworked anyway.

Attack? The whole point of crypto is to be censorship resistant and that is not the case if it's not attack resistant. If vanilla segwit dies it is no longer bitcoin. How on earth are you expecting bitcoin to be the future of money if it can't handle competing forks.

You traded at huge gains, so you are most likely subject to huge cap gains on that. You've roughly 4xed your initial fiat and traded, so you are looking at something like 20% on 75% of your holdings. My guess is you owe 0.3 btc to your tax authority. All dependent on where you live, timing of transactions, other losses etc. Use or hodl, never do shitty taxable trades.

1.7 transactions per month isn't really using, that's still in the realm of testing and trying. Most people in deved nations do more transactions per day. Also the fees got so bad lots of people moved to other alternatives, why switch back and keep track of current fees everyday? Fees must be consistently low to be used as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:14:25

Satoshi is the lowest denomination of bitcoin.  
1 Satoshi = .00000001 BTC.  
1 micro-bitcoin ("bit") = .000001 BTC.  
  
If 1 BTC = $1,000,000, then:  
1 bit = $1  
100 Satoshi = $1  
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:51:13
Not sure how the technology works, but I believe code could be implemented to get even lower denominations.  
1 million USD / BTC is by no means a sweet spot. $10,000 / BTC would make the same calculation. In this example 10 bits = $0.10.  
  
There is no sweet spot, since no matter the value there is a denomination we can use. If I'm wrong about the possibility of code implementation then there might be a potential problem once we reach 10-100 million USD per BTC. At that point the market cap would be around 2,000,000,000,000,000 or two thousand trillion dollars. At a population of 10 billion people this is $200,000 per person.  
  
Bitcoin has a pretty fair leadway when it comes to divisibility and names for divisions of 10. At the hypothetical scale of bitcoins magnitude proposed in this thread you can't measure in dollars or any other currency. At the proposed scale there is too much value stored in bitcoin for another currency to have significance. At that point you need to think about the purchasing power of 1 satoshi rather than anything else. What that would be in terms of todays $1 is anyones guess.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:50:35
Your fiat currencies do not fluctuate up an down. They all lose value (purchasing power) over time, the fluctuations you see are due to fiat losing value at different rates at different times compared to each other. Cryptos are increasing in purchasing power, as such entities speculate in them and will continue to do so until market cap reflects the use value of blockchain tech.  
  
In 2013 the price of btc went down 80% after a short peak. That was almost half its lifetime ago. It is far more stable now, excluding the last two months where we have been in reverse freefall. Graphs are poor indicators of future growth, yet that is what people retort to. The guy who said a week ago that you don't buy at all time high, you simply don't, could have bought in and cashed out 40% already. 
When the market moves this fast there is a lot of uncertainty. We don't know if a correction is coming or if this is the correction. I believe this is the correction, but that when it stops it will have a bubble effect because that's what people expect, and therefore will act out.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:53:34

Not dramatically different, nothing close to hedge funds. Most if not all his bets are negatively affected by a stock market downturn. In fact high risk is the only way to reach the heights he has.  
  
The high risk strategy is integral to his approach, hence the 10 year $500,000 bet against Protégé Partners hedge fund. Btw, that bet was placed right before the crash of 2008, the very event that hedge funds are made for. The bet could not have been placed on a worse time for Buffet, yet he's winning by a landslide.

We have a lot of governments on this planet, so far they have never been in unison on anything. I doubt making bitcoin illegal is going to be the first thing everyone agrees on. Even if it were to happen, what does that mean? Would it be illegal to have an in game currency in world of warcraft too? Would block chain technology be illegal? If so would keeping a public ledger be illegal, since that is basically what it is? If so would a private ledger be illegal? If so is accounting illegal? Efforts might be made in this direction, but long term you can't keep block chain technology illegal without entirely oppressing the population.  
  
Other use illegal? Like bartering? Illegal to use a token to signify value? what's the difference then between a token and a signed piece of paper? Are signatures and escrow services then also illegal since they perform the same task with the same technology? (escrow services are signed digitally quite often)  
  
No crypto can make another crypto worthless. Cars didn't make horses worthless, but they aren't widely used as transportation. Bitcoin is in no way shape or form dependent on other cryptos failure. If Dash takes over the market for digital cash and ethereum takes the market for smart contracts, bitcoin still wouldn't disappear over night. That is beside the point though, the article was a newspaper saying someone divested from traditional paper investments while vesting in bitcoin. Most likely because they can't write cryptocurrencies, since no one buying the paper knows what that is. I believe bitcoin in that article is synonymous with crypto currencies.

I switched because for no reason they suddenly shut down my option of withdrawing fiat. A feature I've never used. I asked why and they responded this service will no longer be possible for me and that they can't provide a reason. I asked why they couldn't provide a reason. Got no answer to that but very quickly got a message saying they had randomly selected me for verification updates. Basically saying I had to provide a lot more documentation or they might limit my service further. Keep in mind I had increased limits a couple of times, so they had all my documentation verified already. 
  
I've been a customer since 2013, no prior issues only ever sent to private wallets from them. It made me realize they were close to freezing my funds with no reason given. Also, when they allow peoply to buy but not withdraw, they are manipulating the market, very sketchy stuff.  
  
Also, they take 2.5%. Kraken 0.25%. They state 1.5%, but because of price inflation you pay a 1% premium on the market rate as well. If you purchase a lot, krakens fees actually decrease.

Ah yes, the old hedge fund approach that earns investors compound fees while reducing short term volatility at the cost of long term returns, what a brilliant concept.  
  
I prefer the Warren Buffet approach - *few* baskets that all carry significant potential for long term growth. In the classic case of stock investments you'd look at management and long term stability and a steady growth curve over at least a decade, but since block chains are decentralized that model is only relatable to ccs with governance. (Ex. DASH, PIVX)

Yeah, not diversifying at all is insane. But most qualified investors miss this point. Hedge fund managers as well as capital investment firms tend to only use stock market instruments to hedge and diversify. The point being, very few (guessing &lt;1%) invest in anything other than fiat backed securities.  
  
Scarcity is rarely considered for pension funds and such. Precious metals and block chain assets are the very essence of diversifying, yet very few people go there. The people who do? Well they are told it's the riskiest thing they could ever do with their money.
