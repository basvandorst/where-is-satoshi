Sure invest in CIA COIN
Face it bitcoin is a cia project
Satoshi Nakamoto means central intelligence in Japanese.
So only a braindead person would trust it.
Btc worthless as more learn it is from an intelligence org.
The overall problems with all encryption are explained well at
So until all new math and encryption is released no crypto can be trusted for wealth.
If your bank gets hacked at least its insured to 100k or did the fed increase it since usd's are worthless too.

Formed first tech company in 76
Still 15 then turned 16 next month
All the girls I date 18-21
They LOL all the time
Reddit is an informal quasi forum/usenet vehicle
Since my own large network of sites now take btc I'm posting about it
So to those few criticizing my style of communication it suits the venue
Anyway no 70
Vast tect exp n knowledge
Lots of net experience
Founded numerous SW companies
Now involved with btc as a merchant and investor/speculator
I love that abbreviation for informal communications which this is

Interesting byrne says now btc is only .24% of sales
At his keynote address he claimed almost 1%
3.6m year not bad bit 10.5m better.
Interesting he mentioned btc moving into derivatives, only other person I heard having btc do derivatives is the author of bitcoin algoritm. With 1500 trillion in derivatives a btc would trade at 50 million to handle 1500 trillion market cap
Gwp is only 85 trillion
I think cheapair.com doing 1.5m in btc sales is a better percentage
Good info
@_date: 2014-07-31 20:25:40
1500 tril estimated derivatives
Yesterday Bryne ceo O
Mentioned btc going into D's
My book on bitcoin while ago mentioned 50m coin if btc takes over all gwp and D
Doubt it will but I think 10% of gwp might happen
1% will
.1% is near

More disinfo
This is his pic showing its recent since he has an iphone 5 in it
You can see lots of fake pics of him
Including pic of sam kinnison
He released ENNISA algorithm for prime dispersement in 1995
Now you have ENISA europes security network
The P and Q couplets of crypto seed numbers came from NIST
They got them from cia n nsa who used ENNISA

That was the series my dad was using then
Our school was one of the first to have a computer science class it used an old 360
I was the only kid able to write the courses program to pass the class
Everyone that passed that class copied my cards
I rigged the keypunch terminal to copy the program i made without my id
So 20 bucks a lot of dough then for kids you got my solution in COBOL and reran the cards punching your id on it
Anyway my programming in 76 to 79 era was customizing acct sw for mid sized companies on mini's not mains
I also did a lot of custom database stuff for realtors in Philly
Home agency I did
They had 30+ offices using modems to the database I did
First interoffice mls they had thanks to me

He released it 1995 to usenet
Lots of his usenet posts removed by cia n nsa
Best source he put into fed court record 1995
Plus its in most of his books
Also known as prime algorithm
U see still posts mockin it
But threads are around if they dont show the formula and theory
1995 he released ENNISIA primes
He also released twin n mersenne algorithm
Same year he proofed fermats riddle using it in two pages
1995 he released creator formula I think a video is still on youtube explaining it
1995 he released PDF a tweak of Titius Bodes for centuries the foundation of physics
Some call pdf titius-bodes-sollog now
Anyone mocking him is a moron or nsa bot
His work on dark matter is called planeium
So he is the guy saying
This is my track record
This is satoshi nakamoto

Looks like bitpay trying to become part of NY banking mafia by their commending them.
Don't merchants realize they dont need bitpay to take btc?
Seems merchants only want to take btc to exchange into fiat, the likely reason for the 10% drop the last 30 days in btc is merchant btc sales have to be liquidated into cash for the big companies saying WE TAKE BITCOIN but they dont hold it.
If you read Overstocks edgar filing with SEC it says they hold no btc but exchange it.
Yet publicly the ceo says they keep some. What they put into edgar sec filing is usually the truth. What the say to the media is PR.
Anyway, free to take it, now sweep into a bank account, oh, there's a fee.
Bitpay has one of the best names though for their service.
Let's create a new campaign.

Then every one needs to buy his books, since recent pics show he looks 20 years younger.
Unless he's Dorian Grey, the recent pics show your pic is bogus.

I doubt btc would become the only currency in the world, but lets assume it does
That currency unit would need to be in value the total of gwp and all D
21m coins into 1000tril+
50m+ coin is total control of all currency for gwp n D
Simple math
1000 trillion+ in total value of gwp n D
50M+ per btc
If the world totally accepted it for all trade and D
Then you move the 8 decimal point satoshi unit to say 10 places
Btc could be the monetary unit to go into deep space exploration and nano medical industry
So a visionary looking at a possible united world government with one cureency thats doing star trek level space exploration means
500m or 5 billion btc coins funding a 100,000 level economy capable of crazy stuff
Deep space exploration
Cloning body parts
Nano tech to heal all diseases
So on a futuristic vision for humanity a united world with one currency unit could have a 100k or a 1M trillion economy
So 21M coins with 10 decimal places could handle such a future
For mankind to grow that far the antiquated ideas of nations and fiat must fail
Btc or another global currency is what mankind needs to do the next level of technology
Guantum computers
Free energy
Deep space
Im just looking at btc to go to 10% of gwp
But long range
Thats the numbers u need to do visionary economies

You have two types of numbers
Now that the algorithm to create all primes is known, the same algorithm creates special relationships in factoring composites.
Primes and composites are interconnected, so any major prime algorithm impacts composite understanding
Crypto relates to bitcoin
New prime algorithms relate to crypto
Thinking ecc doesn't use primes is wrong
The factors are primes

Next bubble
Then 1%
Then 10%
.1% = 5k value btc

So bitcoin algorithm com
I saw it also on amazon at a crazy price but you read free chapters
Some of his other books say he prices them high on amazon because they charge 65% commision and he says he donates it to a charity
I got mine for free but the info is worth his charge on his site since he takes 40% off via bitcoin
If you buy on amazon its four times his sites price, so I guess he hates amazon
So thats his site just enter title com

Interesting analysis of historic btc bubbles, but the best work I've seen is the bitcoin algorithm analysis. It shows 5 past 10 fold bubbles tied to user base and gwp.
So next bubble is user based growth, predicted to occur end of 2014 or early 2015. Then its 10k btc bubble 5k support the same as last 5 bubbles.
1000/500 current bubble
100/50 last bubble
10/5 previous
1/.50 
Next is
Its tied to user growth as % of population and gwp
It was done by a guy with a doctorate in math

End of year or early 2015 next growth bubble hits
