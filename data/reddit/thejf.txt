Thanks for this weekly newsletter! It's nice to have something like this.
I print it every week and post it up at our hackerspace, HubCityLabs, here in Moncton, as a resource to learn about Bitcoin.

I have a "test bed" kind of site, I'll clean it up and upload it so people can see what it looks like in action.

I'm onboard with most of this. I am in the early stages of building a Bitcoin-based business and a few things out of this are relevant to what I'm doing: 
First, I want my business to be clean, professional, legit and as far away removed from any "outlaw" connotation. The business will have an official legal structure, Bitcoins will be declared as barter (hence taxable) to the Canada Revenue Agency, and I will do my best to operate transparently while keeping consumer privacy.
Second, the bulk of my efforts will be going towards providing the best user experience possible, which includes a lot of time and money spent on interface design. My philosophy is that we now live in a world where good design on the web is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity. If your product doesn't look the part, you will lose a big part of the market. The only time this isn't true is when you're providing something really niche or your customers absolutely need the features you're providing.
Finally, I like Ƀ as a symbol for Bitcoins, and I will be using it to list the prices on the site.

Yep, about two weeks ago we agreed to accept them, although we haven't set anything up for that yet.
