When you try to compare "bitcoin" to the modern banking ecosystem, it is only natural for bitcoin to fall short. It was never meant as a replacement for a whole industry, but just to be "better money". It's better than cash in many ways, but cash has layers upon layers of service industry piled on top of it that make it easier and more convenient to use. Services like these will emerge for bitcoin as entrepreneurs find niches that can be exploited.
If you find that the bitcoin ecosystem is lacking a certain kind of service, and you are so inclined, feel free to take it to development!

What would happen if, all of sudden (and for some reason... *wink*), there was only $5 left in all of USA? That's not a lot, right? Just five. But why is "five dollar" a small amount? Because the market says so. You get paid a couple thousand a year for your job, and spend a proportional amount on your stuff. This movement is what gives each dollar it's perceived value.
If, for whatever reason, we had only five of those things left, you would be paid $0.0000000000000000000000000000000004 a year for your job, and probably pay $0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000024 for a car. You get the point. People would start using smaller units (nanodollars, or whatever is adequate) to talk about, and use money, because "one dollar" is a metric truck load of money nobody in their sane mind would spend on anything.
Of course this situation would never happen in the states, because the feds would just print moar dollas like crazy, and the perceived value of $1 would stay relatively stable in the grand scheme of things. But you can't just print Bitcoin, so their value will rise. Thankfully, we can divide them as much as we want. If 2 satoshis can buy you a car, then that's the value of 2 satoshis, and nobody will care about "one bitcoin", because it's just way too big of a unit.

Companies using Facebook for official statements. Beyond silly. Send a fucking email to your customers. If your email is down, I'd much rather you use twitter than facebook. And yet, I'd really prefer they put up a static page on a backup/rerouted server instead of any of that.
Social media just makes everything worse.

In N-of-M transactions, N out of M involved people have to agree about who gets the money, otherwise it's invalid.
A simple case would be a 2-of-3 transaction, involving you, a merchant, and a third party evaluator. If the deal is clean, you and the merchant agree, and it's sealed. If he doesn't deliver what you paid for, you and the evaluator agree, and the money stays in your wallet. If you act up, the evaluator agrees with the merchant, and the money is sent. In either case, since the transaction is from you to the merchant, but simply requires 2 out of 3 signatures to be validated, the evaluator has no means of taking the money for himself.
I never meant to remove anyone, although it could be done automatically, as long as the transaction validity can be tied to a programatically obtainable data point. The point is that there's no need for "escrow", as in a third party holding the funds for you.

I'm not sure how they'd go about trying to "own" bitcoin. It's certainly rather... impossible, as far as I can tell. But "fiat" simply means that something is sactioned by an authority. I don't see the government sanctioning Bitcoin. Could you imagine the mess that taxes would be?

They split the flow of information into tightly controlled and potentially censored channels, and take away our freedom and our privacy. You need to realize that Facebook is not a service for us, the users, but a platform for ad sellers and marketing teams to reach a potentially large consumer base. You are not the customer. You are the product they are selling to someone else. And I am not fine with that.
People like having a choice, and by locking people in to Facebook et al, we're having a choice taken away from us. In particular, the choice to consume information the way we want to consume it, as opposed to how Zuckerberg thinks we should. This is actually much more important than you might think at first.
What happens if Facebook becomes the standard you seem to think it already is? What happens if Zuckerberg decides he doesn't want a certain kind of information on *his* site? What happens if the government, or someone else, pressures Facebook to eliminate a certain kind of information? Facebook is a single point of failure for freedom of speech. And before you even go down that lane, censorship is *real*, not some tinfoil hat theory. You're reading We're all wearing the same tinfoil hats here, if any.
And speaking of tinfoil hats, you might argument that I avoid online socialization because I have something to hide. Well, yes, I do. Everyone does. What I hide is my life. Because what I do and don't do is not anyone's goddamn business. Telling me to stop whining and make a Facebook account is moronic, at best.


I didn't say that I don't use social media. I said that it's cheap and irresponsible for them to use it for important communication matters.


No, but I need to keep checking it. Email comes to me. Twitter, not so much, especially if you don't have an account. And if you do, important information has a tendency to get buried in the nonsense other people tweet about.

I'm excited because Bitcoin makes my work easier.
I'm do a little freelance programming on the side, and work with people from just about anywhere in the world. I don't care where they come from, as long as we can communicate somehow, and why would I. People from some countries have trouble with services such as Paypal, and bank transfers get expensive very fast. Bitcoin has allowed me to conduct business in an easy and straightforward fashion with these people.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:53:40
If the guy owns all that money, you don't have to care. There's no enslavement happening. If he spends the money, it's being distributed back into the system. If he doesn't, you can safely act as if that money doesn't exist.
@_date: 2013-04-21 11:42:00
Well yeah. People still trade Bitcoin depending on their value in fiat, so as the fiat value drops, more coins get traded. Still interesting, nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:09:30
There's no need for that. We have milli- and microbitcoin today. We'll just use [the next step]( in decimal prefixes. Yoctobitcoin, anyone?
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:32:34
Well, yeah, there are only so many ways to purchase things with fiat after all. Wire transfer would also work, as well as many other services similar to Paypal. You can also obtain bitcoin by accepting them for services or goods, of course.
@_date: 2013-05-27 02:28:58
The protocol looks interesting. Now we need good clients.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:05:43
That is purely dependant on the client implementation. In the end, it's just numbers. Today, it doesn't make any sense to go any deeper than a satoshi. Heck, that's already too deep for practical value for almost everything. But tomorrow? Who knows. If 1BTC costs five mellion dollas, then you just don't trade a whole bitcoin. Just like you don't trade in solid packs of $5m.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:31:13
You're making a castle out of a grain of sand. This kind of thing has already happened, and the market stabilized within a few days. Maybe it'd take longer, but things would still even out, as long as people *want* to use bitcoin.

I didn't know that. Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:44:59
Well, yes, but at least you can still use gold for something, should it's perceived monetary value plummet to the ground at some point.
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:01:37
Quite evidently, we have very different views on freedom. Maybe I'm wearing a tinfoil hat and you're right, or maybe I'm right and you're not. Only time will tell. I'm just trying to take precautions.
My whole point is that if it's fine for companies to use Facebook et al for public announcements and customer communication, because it's widespread enough for it to be effective, we've given away our freedom to someone else, who might or might not shut it down in the future. If shit happens, and I hope it doesn't, it's going to be quite some trouble to fix up and regain our freedom. I don't want to rely on the benevolence and integrity of others.
tl;dr people should not expect all of their customers to read Facebook/Twitter/etc because it's a very bad idea for *everyone* to rely on Facebook.

I run my own email, on a private secure server, along with a few other bits and pieces of my digital life. As I said, I don't like relying on other people's benevolence. But that's just me, and because I consider those things to be very important. If all you use your email for is random automatic email from services you don't even care about, by all means, just use yahoo, or hotmail, or whatever; it doesn't matter in the slightest.
My ISP can shut me down, but I can just hire someone else to access the same information. Or I could go rogue and plug into other people's wifi and use tor. I have a *choice* here. If I rely on Facebook and they decide they don't want me, I'm boned for everything Facebook provided for me.
Mind you, I'm perfectly fine if companies use social media for marketing. That's pretty much what they were designed for in the first place. What I was talking about, way up there, is effectively communicating with your customers in a critical situation; read: severe outage of an important service. "Here's a new thing we'd like to sell" is not the same kind of information as "We're under attack! Everyone hold the line!", and should not get the same treatment.
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:06:50
Bitcoind doesn't "only go" to 8 decimal places. Current implementations decided to display that many because displaying more is not useful today. There's nothing hindering us from using any amount of decimals, if the need arises.
EDIT: Of course, it quickly becomes silly to send, say, 0.000000000000000000000001BTC.
Clients currently support milli- and microbitcoin to depict very small transactions, but we have yet to reach a BTC value where such small fractions are practical. One mBTC is worth $0.091 today. One µBTC is worth $0.00007097 today. And we still have a bunch of smaller prefixes that make even less sense for Bitcoin right now.

The blockchain, is quite literally a *chain* of blocks. Each block contains information about a set of transactions, and some information from the previous block, linking the two together. A block can only have one ancestor, and one child. This is why it's called a *chain*, instead of a mesh, grid, or whatever. The blockchain is *linear*.
A fork occurs when two branches of the chain exist at the same time; that is, a block that has two children. Only one of these children is valid, of course. This can happen when a mining software update changes the rules by which blocks are created, thus potentially having two sets of miners who disagree about which block is the right one, during the time it takes from the first miner to update his software, until the last one does. Please note that generally no coins are lost in a fork. The worst that could happen is that some clients accept the stale branch as valid, and thus act on incorrect information in the ledger. This is why people are urged to keep their coins during a fork, until the network stabilizes on the valid branch.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:41:59
No, really. It would take for-fucking-ever with current hardware. And if hardware ever evolves enough to make this kind of operation worthwhile, the Bitcoin protocol will simply evolve to adapt. If what you propose was viable, it would shake Bitcoin to the bones, and shatter the entire ecosystem. It's not something taken lightly by the developers.
"Brute force" basically means that it generates addresses willy nilly until one matches the pattern you fed it. The bigger the pattern, the longer it will take. A full-address pattern would literally take the fastest computer on earth 0.65 billion billion years to crack. I was just trying to be funny with the grand children line.

There's still more bitcoin to be mined. We use the remaining bitcoin and forget about those who were lost, as if though they never existed in the first place. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, so the actual amount in existence doesn't matter, as long as you can represent actual value with them. Of course, the USD value of 1BTC would shoot up dramatically, causing us to use smaller fractions of a bitcoin.
EDIT: Also, no matter who we are talking about, if they are buying bitcoin and destroying them, they are effectively throwing fiat out the window with zero return for them. People don't like throwing money away.

* Make cold storage and backups easy. Deterministic backups are a huge bonus. Help with paper wallet generation too, if you can get it right.
* Integrate with mobile wallets. Make it easy for me to move coins to and from my other wallets, which may or may not be stored on the same computer.
* Allow for bandwidth throttling. Having your pipe suddenly clogged because someone needs an update isn't nice.
* Wallet import and export. Assume that I already have a wallet elsewhere and might want to continue using it. Don't lock me into your software once I start using it.
* Be open source, so those who are better than you can scrutinize your code and help you.
* Be autonomous, and not store half my data on your servers. Partly because I do not trust you, and never will, but also because I don't want my wallet to stop working when you get DoS'ed.
* Do not hide any information just because you think the user might not understand it. Clarity and transparency. If something is not intuitive, explain it instead of hiding it.
* Stay out of the way when I don't need it. Don't clutter my task bar, and don't rely on a system tray being present on Linux, please.
* A personal pet peeve: an accessible cli interface that doesn't require me to read json.
Pick your own top 3.

The term fiat means:


or, in other words, a currency sanctioned by the government, or whoever is in charge. They will always want a slice of the pie. If what you are asking is whether Bitcoin might replace the Euro, or the US Dollar, then the answer is "perhaps". But it will do so via getting sanctioned by the government, effectively turning Bitcoin into the new fiat currency.
So, no. Bitcoin will never "replace fiat".

What it is going to cause is that people will try to avoid banks whenever possible. We are still tied to them for a lot of services, but with enough social pressure, this can be changed. I don't expect my local grocery store to accept bitcoin any time soon, but if I can pay at least some of my bills with it, that's already a great change, for the better.

I don't get the thing with the change. It makes sense in physical cash transactions, but when it's digital, you can send a precise amount without hassle.

A third party service would be required, unless the extension is to interact with bitcoind, which can also act as an "address book" of sorts. I'm not sure browser extensions can do that though.

What we need is proper education material. Handling fiat is second nature because we've been taught about it forever, in a million different ways. Fiat is not "easier", necessarily anyway; it's just much more familiar. A big focus of the bitcoin community should be on telling people, in layman's terms, how to handle bitcoins. A large portion of the necessary security will come from knowledge, in time.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:24:26
I know what you mean. Bitcoin can function properly without exchanges, but it will lose a lot of practical application for most people if exchanges become troublesome, and competition becomes scarce in the face of giants like Amazon picking up the business niche.

I just signed up as freelancer. Looking forward to some bitjobs :)
A little feedback, from the things I saw while registering:
* Get rid of that example job. Have a (never to be seen again) "no jobs available" graphic instead.
* After signing up, I was sent to the front page without any sort of status update. I was a little confused for a second.
* You probably want to make the font in the little toolbar at the very top a little bigger.
* The header image should probably showcase projects or whatever once a user is logged in, instead of continuing to offer to register.
* The image in the header looks like a convict posing for his mugshot :P
* Have text areas accept markdown/textile, and state that they do. At the very least, the "about me" thing will require some formatting. Give people a little power and freedom to turn their profile into a mini-portfolio.
* The site feels a little sluggish, might want to look into caching.
Best of luck with your project!
EDIT: I received two emails. One with a confirmation link, and one to tell me I was confirmed. They both had exactly the same subject. Please make them different. I don't think you need to send the second mail at all, to be honest. Since the confirmation link sends me to the site anyway, just give me a nice little message there.

We can try. It's their choice to stay ignorant. We should not become ignorant just so we're not different. I will continue to use the term "hacker" by it's correct definition; and whoever misunderstands me is free to call me out and ask for an explanation.

Unless you have "free" electricity, which is the case for me. I make a laughable amount of bitcoin off my background mining (1Ƀ/year, aprox), but it's free coins, as far as I'm concerned.

In the end, money is only as valuable as the stuff you can exchange it for. If I couldn't buy food with this piece of paper I got in my hand, then it would have absolutely no value. Merchants accepting bitcoins for their goods are far more important to Bitcoin's value than their exchange rate in fiat.

Well, she's had time to get ten years worth of experience in the field, one up or down. After ten years of applied career, you could be beginning to be a field expert. So yes, she *is* young. About as young as you can be in her position.

News? I thought we were talking about customer communication here.


The nature of information is irrelevant. Different bits of data hold different value to different entities. You'd be surprised how much a tiny bit of personal information is worth on the black market, or even just to ad sellers. Remember chain emails back in the early years? Those made a ton of money for some people, and they contained nothing but a name and an email.
It doesn't matter whether what you say on the internet is problematic or complete nonsense. It's your free speech, and nobody should hold the power to shut it down.


And having a twitter account solely for updates about bitstamp makes sense, right? Here, sign up to our super serious money trading site. And now, sign up for twitter so we can tell you when we fuck up, because we don't know how to use email.

This looks really interesting. Evidently, the Bitcoin protocol is useful for more than "just" money. We just need good end user applications that make it transparent and easy to use. For a messaging platform to work, it needs to be multi-platform, with synchronized history, so that I can have multiple clients (think phone + computer) online, and hop from one another without my interlocutors having to know or care about it.

A lot of people, believe it or not, don't want to use Facebook or Twitter, or any other form of bollocks media sites, and a lot of companies choose to ignore these people. I find that to be unacceptable.
I said Twitter was better than Facebook for this, because short, succinct updates is what Twitter was built for, and is what a lot of people (angry teenagers and cat pictures notwithstanding) use it for. However, it's still not the proper way to handle things, I believe.
Dealing with a DoS attack is pretty hard, probably the hardest situation a sysop gets to deal with before we go into security breach territory, but it's not impossible. There *are* ways to still get word out, even under the pressure of 900Gb/s. Relying on niche services is just cheap. These people are dealing with our money. Being cheap is pretty bad for consumer trust.
Before you rage at me calling Facebook a "niche service", please bear in mind that when shit goes south, you want to get word ASAP to 100% of your customer base, not to only the subset of them who use Facebook. You have no way of knowing or controlling how many of your customers use Facebook, and you should not rely on them for important matters.
EDIT: You may not be able to access your main database cluster during a severe outage, but trying to *react* to such a situation is wrong anyway. You want to be proactive, and have measures ready for when it all goes down, so you just have to flip a switch. Scrambling *after* the shit hits the fan isn't going to solve anything.

5 downvotes, and you're the first person that bothers actually asking. Well done, have an upvote.
Because it's essentially a backup, and a very important part of managing your wallet. The more nerdy folks will always use weird contraptions to do what they do, but my Grandma might wind up using Bitcoin, if it winds up with the success we all hope for, and she isn't going to be hooking up an arduino to her printer.
