No, it starts at 6:00 and everyone is expected to arrive at exactly 5:55. Because this is how we party.

All these attacks just make it stronger in the end. Gotta have the guts to ride it out though because rough days will be ahead.

Familiar with the internet through the 90's? 2008 was when it really started to connect people in a meaningful way and have access to great information.

All I want for Christmas is Andreas to do a parody video... Just throwing bills around and in some flashy clothes... I think he could make it hilarious.

Are you kidding me! The Bitcoin space was held by Libertarians kid, get that Trump junk outta here.      
   
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:39:31
Just like anyone not expecting a stock market crash or the decline of the USD isn't paying attention. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:19:10
Something about the way Milton speaks though, like when he explained the free market through a pencil in a few minutes is it's own kinda brilliance. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:58:44
It's a coin meme, it goes UP and DOWN. Not sure you know what's going on here. Jamie is that you? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:20:02
Our public figures (USA at least) should all be taking notes, such a great response. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:44:31
Nope, we regulate by using another exchange. I left went to Gemini. If anyone has better solutions I'm listening. Let the market wreck em.

Buy Bitcoin

Also, the tulip mania may not have been as big as we thought. Also, it was all through credit, something lacking in crypto. Blah blah yeah it's annoying when peeps compare tulips and btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:26
He only invests in what he knows and tried and true investments. He is not into new tech. He's hasn't the slightest clue about Bitcoin and never will. Doesn't matter because he doesn't need it and we don't need him. Bitcoin wasn't invented for the Warren Buffets of the world.

Just wait a week...

Just did my first trade today with Gemini. I setup months ago with gemini and kraken just in case. Well that just in case happened. I'll never go back to GDAX/Coinbase

Hodl on brother!
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:42:30
I like to bring up QE, negative interest rates and correlate all the money the fed prints to the stock market, then they kind of just mumble and sheep away. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:48:18
Which is why Libertarians were the earliest supporters, none of this Trump junk. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:01:02
Well they don't deserve to be in the game if they are losing hope so soon. Most of them don't even care about the tech, they just want to make a quick buck. I've survived yearly bear markets, gotta pay your dues. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:13:36
I said lacking, didn't mean non-existent. The tulip mania was believed to be close to %100 credit. I don't believe Bitcoin is near that. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:16:10
I hear ya, I usually spell the last name as Vermin, it's like a spell check thing or something.

For me it's about the only upside to Trump and I hope his administration embraces it. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:32:46
I say we all get together and take out an ad on Fox News and try to get Trump to tweet about it in a good light. We will have the biglyest boom of all time.

Somebody snapped a pic of some old school painting (or something) on Twitter and his name was Ferninand Hodler. This is playing on the joke with the fake satoshi, Craig Wright. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:21:49
It's happening!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:11:51
My guess is lurker, why? Well he probably posted in of the most brilliant replies of all time to receive.... Down votes. Then as a test he replied with TP Poop and got a thousand upvotes and decided from then on he doesn't understand Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:53:36
I think it was part of a bigger scheme and the others were in on it. Try to convince people he is the real Satoshi, then tried to sway everyone a certain way. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:50:39
I would say that's the bargaining stage, " the blockchain technology will revolutionize the world but not Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:36:16
That's awesome, perhaps even gentleman. Good for you! 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:23:29
Already doing it in Africa through cell use. Also, you act like the USD has been a stable utility for thousands of years, it's only been several decades as the form it is in now. It's not like it is a guarantee, just wait til China gets off the USD for oil see what happens then. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:58:15
Well let's see, he is trying to get internet to places that do not have internet access and they also do not have banking access either(think Africa homie!). Are you even serious? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:29:52
Buying Bitcoin and not checking the price is like training for a marathon and not talking about it... Just Urban legends. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:23:51
The increase was mainly from exchanges not implementing batch transactions. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:06:22
Lol. How is the price have any correlation to the underlying tech and usefulness. You know the market is extremely manipulated but that does not mean anything against Bitcoin itself. When gold and silver have crashed (or been held down because of futures) it doesn't mean gold has changed just the market. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:28:46
Kinda sound like many people circa 2000... "Why would I use a camera on my phone when the pictures are all grainy, it's never going to be as sweet as my disposable camera."

Decoupling from China is going to be such a relief and much more healthy for the long term. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:52:00
Really it's our only defense in many cases. Also, big business has spent a lot of money to change our perspective on lawsuits. Many of the ads you see that say "Citzens vs such and such" are usually nothing less than corporations behind them and 1 of the biggest topics they push is that lawsuits are bad. Trying to influence us away from the ability to sue. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:10:36
What about the Billions who have no access to a bank or USD? What's your plan for them?
