My bad

So all there calculations are based on btc being 14k usd. Why not show current price calculations live? Overshooting imo

But bch blindly followers ver. This is why both coins will remain altcoins and nothing more

I think a lot of it is manipulated in some Chinese / Korean exchanges where they simply buy coins off themselves with no fees to bump up the daily trade value. Someone may be able to confirm but I believe that’s why cmc dumped a lot of them off there statistics
Could be wrong, either way I think there acting shit and hopefully you get it back

I actually feel bad for this guy, gives the little exchange a chance than wham fucks him over. Hope you get it back and this exchange either dies or sorts it’s shit out

Hopefully someone will come with another answer but if you get stuck there is a trading bot on margin.de that has this exact feature

Glad to be honest, a slower more natural rise over the next few years is better for us all imo

Love it

We've gone full retard over here

So coinbase will use there GDAX platform to make the trade. If the last order was ask at (insert higher price) that's the price it will show, but the highest bid order is (insert lower price) that's the price you will pay now to sell
All normal stuff
*edited exchange name 
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:32:51
Changed exchange name you are right. Apart from that I think you are wrong, they will need to make the exchange. They don't just have it sat there and make a price up for it 
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:42:19
So you would need to put the stop at say 5601 and the limit at 5600. That's the way I do it and it seems to work fine
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:31:37
So easiest way to remember 
If bitcoin hits this (stop price)
Than buy or sell at this  (limit price)
