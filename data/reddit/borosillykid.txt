He said he doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand...

Fuck yeah buddy

Unfortunately people panic. I completely agree with you, but none the less losing as dramatically as these gains would make any one nervous

LMFAO hold onto your chakras

That's where I'm at everyone is like wait till you have a bunch to invest. I'd rather put some in regularly then spend it on beer/ other shit that just gets consumed.

@_date: 2018-05-20 23:56:56

Damn that's too bad. I couldn't imagine trying to drive on the freeway in that.

Is this the Lambo everyone has been talking about? How much horsepower does this baby make? I bet at least 100.

If you have a debit card and want crypto right now and are willing to pay 4% fee's than go for it!
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:03:52
I'm going to cry... 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:35:50
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:42:15
The fees are high AF. It's not too bad otherwise, honestly probably good for cryptos becuase it easily gets people into them.
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:43:36
That would be lit Famalamadingdong

First off that's no lambo. Second, why would you ever park a nice car in such a terrible spot. I'd choose an end spot.
