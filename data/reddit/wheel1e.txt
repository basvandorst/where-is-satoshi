Its what we all want to happen, but does it work like this in real...can't say I really believe in it for now.

I see these posts about bitcoin, but what are they going to say about doge in 2 years time. Lots of people downtalk that coin also now, but I see potential. peace ;)

I was exactly the same, for some reason I like it from the very first start I dropped by the doge community.

I still don't get it why people downvote something like this. Somebody just asks a fairly good question out of interest to meet and greet fellow digital currency believers, and he gets downvotes.
voted up by me!

If you see how many followers Doge has, just because its funny.
How the meme looks the text around it its stupid but funny also. The price is interesting! If the mass adopts crypto most of them will probably start with a coin where they can buy a nice amount for a small amount of money.
I see lots of childeren running in Dogecoinshirts, just like when Jurasic Park came out :D
Lots of potential just because its funny, be honest nothing funny about Bitcoin. (only if you bought in 2011/12)

Damn funny to read some of the posts. I really hope we look back the same way in 2 years from now and prices went up the same like we read in that post :D

If the price of Bitcoin was stable, a shitload of money would be pumped into BTC. But the wealthy don't want to take such risk at this moment. Can't really blame them, to bad i'm not in their possition to worry where to bring all of my monnies now :D

These numbers may happen if we can explane cryptocurrency the the average Joe. It's just still to difficult to understand for to many, together with the "bad" news I don't see it happening. Don't get me wrong I really like crypto's but we have to find a way to bring the message and I still don't know exactly how to explane it simple and understandable in 3 minutes.

Bitcoin and HACK in one sentence, is not really what we need at this moment if we want more people to start joining us. If average Joe reads Bitcoin believers sponsor Hackathon and he has no clue (like me) what is actually going on there don't think its the thing we really need now IMO
