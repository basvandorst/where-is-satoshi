There is a whole study and research behind the inflated price of bitcoin in 2017 when Wall Street said it would “tame” it. That’s when the price went up to nearly cross the $20,000 mark, aligned with other speculations around bitcoin.

$7650 and dropping. Hope it goes to low 7000’s

Yeah I would assume so. I’ve been to other ones in London where they would normally charge 5% - 7.5% for buying/selling
Also, main language on this one was Spanish lol not sure what they are trying to accomplish

Yeah but who’s getting more fame from it? BTC street gang for the massive search and FOMO on BTC? Or BTC Crypto for the notorious BTC gang?

That just means you are viewing a “watch only” wallet. You need to know the private keys and password to be able to login to the blockchain account and move/manage your bitcoin

Yeah.. I was shocked because I used to trade in some BTC to fiat from time to time in that bitcoin ATM

I frequently come to that shopping center.
The ATM used to be good, and you could buy or sell bitcoin. Now it only allows you to buy bitcoin with a min of £2500 :(

Fixed fee of £2,50 to sell. Haven’t checked buy - it’s just like those machines you have to pay a tax in fiat to withdraw your money

You know what would be awesome? If you used caricatures for crypto people instead of toons. You can make Craig Wright the joker

33% Fiat, 33% bitcoin, 33% stocks and the remaining 1% in cash just to buy a ticket home if all else fails
