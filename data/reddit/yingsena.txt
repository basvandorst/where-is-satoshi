I thought I read on bitcoinmagazine that Bryne had mentioned that T0 had developed a propitiatory blockchain, Maybe confusion surrounding T0's propitiatory ledger!
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:12:09
They are looking to capitalize on the bitcoin blockchain, it's distributed consensus but they fail to identify risks associated with increasing centralization.  Eventually a private blockchain specifically designed for the purpose, that has known actors securing the chain, will be used. T0 has left the door open, in that using a propitiatory ledger with minimum use of bitcoin (which can be replaced by a more suitable technology in the future). 
@_date: 2015-12-16 08:51:43
 
 No, T0 is a propitiatory ledger aka "private blockchain" the bitcoin blockchain, unless otherwise specified will be used as a notary.

Overstock has not made an announcement, yet as to whether it will issue crypto securities. Patrick Byrne is on record as saying they may consider issuing a fairly small public crypto security to demonstrate the system.  
I think you are confused. The 5mm crypto bond was something else but yes all part of the overall proof of concept or demonstration. Private chain doesn't mean a chain that is not publicly accessible, more to do with write permissions and i suppose who secures it a consortium of banks or miners!

Overstock also made corrections and clarifications to an earlier Bitcoinmagazine article.

and now this... "to.com has built its own proprietary blockchain, which will then be publicly distributed." 
@_date: 2015-12-16 09:35:32
Yeah, they're looking to CAPITALIZE on Bitcoin to validate ownership which is notarization of T0's propitiatory ledger or private blockchain record. 
Bitcoin's blockchain being the relevant distributed ledger for the purpose of notarization, unless otherwise specified, which means it is subject to change, hence ledger agnostic.

Now, Overstock will consider issuing a fairly small public crypto security to demonstrate that the T0 system works.

@_date: 2014-12-18 18:09:09
That's how I understood it, KYC/AML will still be a requirement, basically means individual users would not be exempt and the regulation in this area could reduce consumer protection, in that personal information would be exchanged unnecessarily for regulations sake! Also mining services that operate hosted wallets and exchanges may need to comply. There could have been a lot more clarity in the speech in relation to personal wallets and hosted wallets as it stands it sounds very much like individuals who choose to use hosted wallets could find they're not exempt from the regulations and have to provide personal identification information that would presumably be stored on a central database for the sake of regulation. Seems like an awful lot of regulation for the sake of regulation the agency is proposing to impose. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:48:14
The irony is that Ben Lawsky actually made reference to the recent mess at Sony over "The Interview" at the same time as outlining these insane regulation proposals that could ultimately make New York Bitcoiners more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Someone please explain how keeping records on private individuals actually protects anyone? To say private individuals won't have to comply with regulation and then impose a system that makes exchanging of personal information a mandatory requirement seems somewhat of a contradiction.  Clearly  doesn't do away with the requirement to keep records. Don't be fooled into thinking it would. Bitcoin looses it's 'digital cash like' appeal once you attach personal identification to it. It's as though nothing has been learnt from decades of online security breaches exposing confidential information.

FWIW Counterparty recreated Ethereum smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain back in Dec 2014.  Ethereum wasn't even released then.

@_date: 2015-08-27 14:35:03
I know they switched from counterparty to open assets, it was in the news and T0 had something like 'powerded by open assets' on their website for a while. That's since changed and now they aren't saying who they are doing it with. 
Edit: Maybe it was 'Speedroute' Byrne couldn't say at his NASDAQ blockchain presentation a while ago and Open Assets (colored coins) just didn't get a mention because it's well... I dunno... tokens 'old technology'  or something not smart. here's something recent on it...

Isn't XT a unique situation, as in, altcoin (BitcoinXT) developers attempting to hijack the bitcoin network? consider this question someone asked the panel in this vdo   "Why wasn't XT just made into an Alt?  
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:06:41
It's easy to understand the logic, for instance in luke-jnr's illustration there's a depiction of Feather coin which is defined as an altcoin. XT coin isn't that different other than perhaps it being passed off as something other than an altcoin.    
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:03:22
It's seemingly logical that XT be labeled an altcoin. Consider the reversal, in that the 'cheap tactic' is to try and pass XT off as anything other than an altcoin.  
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:58:06
Again, from luke-jr's illustration, it can be seen that the 0.8.1 hard fork, gives an example "removal of BDB lock limits" . 
Manually configurable BDB lock limits or least varied conditions were overlooked in the introduction of 0.8.0 it was a major oversight, introducing something that wasn't thoroughly tested, those conditions existing and known to exist prior to the introduction only makes it worse.
@_date: 2015-08-27 06:39:00
He's not saying, who he's doing it with nor is Counterparty/Symbiont. 
There's this from Counterparty: "However, as we onboard more clients and partners, and develop more products, we will not be able to discuss if, why or how that client product uses or does not use Counterparty. (Determining use of Counterparty should be clear to anyone via a Counterparty block explorer.)" 
The idea is that T0's ledger agnostic so it could potentially use an altcoin blockchain but for now T0's block explorer displays Counterparty asset transactions when an asset address is entered. names are not supported, least it reports an error if an asset name is entered, not sure if that's a feature or bug as it clearly prompts: 'Search transactions, addresses, or assets' 
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:33:53

The relevance of 0.8 unintentional fork becomes clearer from reading this, early in the article by David Floyd on the NASDAQ "a tweak Hearn introduced to version 0.8 caused a discrepancy between miners running that version and the previous one. Read more: 
I keep hearing about an unintentional fork that occurred in March 2013. didn't really pay much attention to it until I noticed altcoin 0.8.0 and fork 0.8.1 depicted on an illustration by luke-jr. Here: 
Did a few searches and found that, it appeared to be an untested backward compatibility error that caused the unintentional bitcoin/fork. The result was the network had to quickly revert back to the previous 0.7. core. A fix was later introduced in 0.8.1 
I think the lesson to be learn't from this is a cautionary tale, that opens a can of worms when considering the merits of switching to XT or not. There's a link in the article to something from back then, see here:  that touches on Hearn putting something in that was developed by google engineers...  
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:53:08
It's ok, I found the answer, 0.8.1 fork did purport to resolve the  incompatibility of 0.8.0. It was an untested backward compatibility error (possibly lock limits) that caused the occurrence of the 0.8.0 altcoin. I suppose we could potentially see a similar thing with XT (considering the apparent lack of testing) 
@_date: 2015-08-23 09:35:12
Clear illustration depicting differences of forks and altcoins. Is it correct to deduce from the illustration that Andresen and Hearn's altcoin/fork has similarities to Core 0.8.0 in that it's technically an altcoin and miners not switching or switching back is the likely outcome?
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:40:02
Is that what the removal of the lock limits was about in the 0.8.1 fork, incompatibility ?
@_date: 2015-08-30 11:51:21

The only way to prevent the glass from overflowing is to reduce it's capacity. 
He talks about shortfalls in the original bitcoin paper and how those or failure to address those have led to centralized mining and reduced incentives. His theory is that scaling could somehow address these shortfalls by introducing incentives for decentralized nodes validating micro transaction that interact with core central mining. 
edit: in short he demonstrated that one answer to bitcoin scalability is to reduce capacity by moving part of the  transaction load to a non-transparent centralized core leaving room for faster transparent liquid client processing.

Not so much a case of finally catching on, more seizing upon an opportunity to expedite what has been gaining traction for sometime.

That pretty much sums it up, unless you're an influential person, banking institution, corporate entity. it's a joke!
Edit: It's hilarious, technically using the network as intended so to discover how much it can handle.
Edit: So if the reason for the high volume of transactions is to establish how many can be made in an apparent 'stress test', what's wrong with that is it really any different to making a single test transaction to see if the system fails.

That's how I understood it also, normal transactions are mostly getting confirmed even quite possibly those with just the standard fees attached. 
I posted earlier that it's unlikely that the network would experience traffic of this magnitude under normal conditions, I might add as unusual here. At present, I'm of the firm opinion that the "stress test" although imaginative failed to simulate "real world" normal network activity.
It has however managed to highlight differences in wallet behavior, some prepared and handled it, others fell over
@_date: 2015-09-08 06:04:51
I could go along with that, except I think Bryne clarified better with 'agnostic ledger' which pretty much validates the point and obviously both are equally unable to just drop bitcoin. Bitcoin inclusion is paramount at this stage but dilution in the language could suggest that might not always be the case. 
**Edit:** Also Digital Assets purchase of Hyperledger and other presentations tell us something more about the separation of bitcoin and the blockchain see

I doubt very much that the NCCU would follow it up let alone pass it to the CPS for consideration. You could go to the NCCU with logs, ip's even a name and confession of an unauthorized penetration test and they would still possibly not take it up. How you would get authorisation from the Bitcoin network is laughable just ask Hearn eh!  
Drak and Hearn, jumping to the conclusion that coinwallet would be in breach of laws without providing any proof whatsoever other than alleged articles and quotes in the media is just wrong. 
There's no concrete indication, admission or otherwise of a planned penetration test or DOS attack, yet both wrongly label it an attack .
If anything it's uncharted waters and making potentially defamatory statements only hypes the "too many Bitcoin payments and the network can't keep up" situation out of all proportion.

Agree with these sentiments : mining is centralized already  and the existence of other more powerful blockchain technologies means Bitcoin may well do to keep its block size limited and target the niche of digital gold.

Andresen &amp; Hearn have unfairly pushed XT on the community. I agree with the sentiment in the video, it's the wrong attention the door has been opened for another, it's blockchain technology in the mainstream media not bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:19:02
Yes, good idea. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:32:00
I agree with them bitcoin has been watered-down because of the xt debacle, It's reckless, to say the least.
@_date: 2015-09-11 06:20:18
There's that separation thing again, a messy divorce but one alternately can change the future for the better. 
**Edit ** also this more about the US and regulation and further bitcoin dilution 
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:13:12
Another company bridging the gap, how many are there now
Edit: Also Masters is another of a growing number who choose to separate bitcoin from blockchain which implies the vision many are seeing is a future on some other decentralized  blockchain. One which there isn't much talk about just yet. although it's recognized to be a problem see   
and what does Max Kieser say about all this evilness  hey?
@_date: 2015-09-22 08:56:18
It's disappointing that they don't talk about mining centralization, it's shrugged off at the end with an analogy of browsers not working without the internet.  
@_date: 2015-09-07 14:56:32
They're building an altcoin with it's own blockchain and asset issuance 
@_date: 2015-09-18 05:23:06


It's centered more around 'compatibility' than 'cloning' the question is how to introduce different blockchain typologies that can communicate with each other using a common protocol. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 01:58:06
I disagree, on part due to mining centralization which introduces points of risk, it's an almost certainty that more institutionalized token-less blockchains will emerge, it's happening already. Asset issuance and blockchains don't have to rely on incentive token coin rewards as in the case of bitcoin and altcoins. Marketing and PR might not distinguish clearly the difference and that suits start-ups entering the space when there's a lot of attention to be gamed from it. It's the start of a fintech bubble.  
@_date: 2015-09-11 00:33:51
I think the blog could be more balanced in that it lacks discussion on the basic fact, that is, what's being experienced is **not normal behavior**, It's unlikely that the network would experience traffic of this magnitude under normal conditions.  
I don't think it achieved it's end goal, The 'stress test' was designed incorrectly, in that, it failed to simulate normal network  activity. 
Was it more a reckless PR stunt? probably and if so it backfired on the perpetrators.
edit: also the point that some wallets had already prepared and could and were able to detect it while others suffered trying to cope with processing abnormal transaction.

Like I said it's two fold, I leave you with 1000 words on the point of shocking lack of judgement
@_date: 2015-09-08 05:18:00
Sure, it's open to interpretation and I would suggest, the point that you're interpreting it speaks volumes in itself, the lack of clarity in the language used is part and parcel of the unfolding separation. We saw this when overstocks Bryne unveiled the T0 blockchain trading platform on wall street. There was a noticeable change in the language bitcoin was dropped replaced with blockchain and not just distributed ledger but agnostic ledger was introduced.
Edit: Also see what Max Keiser was reported to have said regards to Masters and Digital Assets, apparently she's the devil woman : )


Keiser is convinced Digital Asset is trying to come up with a proprietary bitcoin solution that will compete with the open source bitcoin as it exists. JP Morgan is known to have quietly filed patents relating to some form of cryptocurrency-like technology. Keiser believes it's an effort bound to failure.

Why would mtgox deserve to have 90% of the market ? 
I don't think it's wrong to post this, it's informative, lots of people seem to have believed in Karpeles,  Roger Ver, Mike Hearn how many other XT supporters ?  is there more to just similarities in the character and features of Andressen and Karpeles are they related ?  it raises so many questions what was that expensive bed used for were they all in it together ?
@_date: 2015-09-20 04:14:04
Hi aminok, I believe an error in judgement would be believing Karpeles deserved 90% of the network.  I'm also on twitter drop by and say Hi.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:25:20
True, Blythe certainly asking the right questions whereas Bryne  steam rolled in asset token (on the bitcoin ledger) and all.
@_date: 2015-09-11 03:42:42
Compared to the other attention grabbing... Well you know. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 07:02:50
yep I understand they have already scaled in many ways which is what makes them different,  with Bitcoin changes are harder to implement. it's that red pill thing...
"better ones will continue to develop"  
@_date: 2015-09-11 16:14:53
Their not really as interested in bitcoin as much as blockchain technologies most just don't know it yet .
Edit: If you don't know already, research three different types of blockchain (public, consortium and fully private) Vitalik Buterin explains this quite well on his blog 
@_date: 2015-09-20 03:41:23


I can see a problem with that 
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:59:26
Yep, it suggests 'tests could'  not 'tests do' 
Maybe consensus could be reached to deny / grant authorisation a hard fork maybe
@_date: 2015-09-16 07:42:30


It's perceived to be a foregone conclusion.
@_date: 2015-09-08 16:17:04
The large B little bs analogy makes sense but, on banking and permissionless blockchains Szabo could have mentioned mining centralization which using his logic also injects points of control &amp; vulnerability. How does that differ to say a consortium of banks validating a blockchain? 
 
@_date: 2015-09-05 01:53:22
Yep. ideally it would, however sidechains, LN aren't proven the concepts are in development stages.  The current situation for projects like Byrne's talking about mainstream use, asset trading, wall st. etc isn't practical as the bitcoin blockchain is unable to cope with high volumes and the result in transaction costs &amp; bottle neck could potentially  throttle bitcoin.

Definitely, controls lots of controls charge buttons, freeze button, set negative interest rate button, reasonably clear.

Sure, most could be forgiven, it's those influential types businesses and such that might have had closer than normal associations, must raise a few eyebrows do you trust so easily these people.

No more or less than the comment in the title of this thread. Tell us, what it takes for bitcoin not to succeed and how do you measure it's success thus far?

R3 looking to create network effect for a banking cartel's permission blockchain, Sound great wonder if it will have incentive rewards 
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:38:20
It's not normal to to keep calling the tests an attack, just saying :)
@_date: 2015-09-04 00:32:18


Imagine the response from the NCCU , "Sorry we're, far too overstretch and under-resourced" waste of time, unless of course you're an influential person or corporate concern.  Even if it did make it as far as CPS consideration that doesn't mean they will prosecute.  
edit: Under the UK system, you can be a victim and find yourself with no recourse.

Some wallets will feel the wait/weight for sure
@_date: 2015-09-17 01:19:23
They could be trying to save a lot more than a couple of bucks. Consider the network effect on disruptive blockchain technology. While on one hand bitcoin and it's community is split at a crossroads over the block size debate and governance on the other institutions are grouping together forming business consortiums that work within a regulatory framework. It's a tipping point in terms of network effect .
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:32:38
Yes, that could be it Karpeles now hates bitcoin and if there's some kind of secret relationship between Andresen, Hearn and Karpeles  it (XT) could be a plot to break bitcoin   
@_date: 2015-10-04 12:21:45
Voorhees consciously collects and retains personal bitcoin addresses, so he's something to hand over if ever subpoenaed and something to leak in the event of a hack.
