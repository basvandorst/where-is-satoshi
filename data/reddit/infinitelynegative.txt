Its a bad argument and they should feel bad
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:20:53
He needs a little push
@_date: 2019-07-10 09:11:20
To be fair he is not wrong about the shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:30:14
I feel bad when it goes up, down or sideways
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:52:23
They are probably asking where they have to deploy the military to stop it :D
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:47:59
except no one buys when it's down 85% lol, so no one (almost) is up 300%
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:55:44
8k is still high, I am waiting for 6k
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:06:53
Ok, let's see how Oct 2019 and later predictions pan out..my guess is they will be off
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:36:09
My realistic prediction is 25k
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:46:49
Do you math? How is 7/20 60% off?
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:01:48
Who cares lol
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:08:05
hardly. Waiting for that 6-8k range entry point
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:50:07
Last time this month, and even that's a bold prediction!
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:02:29
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:45:49
Still 65% down
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:12:28
Yes, 8k inc
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:35:19
That's stupid too. There's no research to be done about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:04:38
Whales already made all their money and left you holding the bags
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:13:17
Yes, smart money is selling low buying high /s
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:49:33
If you bought and sold at the right time sure. Now most of them are worthless
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:17:40
DCA down maybe. We don't know how low it's gonna go.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:49:02
Ive proved TA wrong too many times to take anyone who mentions it seriously anymore
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:12:44
Wait for 6-8
@_date: 2019-07-10 09:15:41
What do you do with the people who rely on those programs? Gas them? Libertarian ideas are good and fair on paper but are a recipe for disaster irl
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:35:10
Negative interest rate is pretty common
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:51:15
Its def not going to zero
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:50:59
Rename it to Conbase!
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:28:34
@_date: 2019-07-31 05:23:41
Don’t try this at home, kids
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:43:25
It isn’t
@_date: 2019-11-06 23:56:13
Ok, I added /s at the end lol
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:11:07
Great recession  inc
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:01:11
Bitcoin 58%
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:38:14
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:53:47
I’m just waiting for everyone to start saying it was “priced in”...
@_date: 2019-11-05 07:42:20
I bought at 2k!!!
@_date: 2019-11-06 17:57:35
I thought we are not supposed to spend bitcoin /s
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:19:51
They aren’t, they are only looking for the lines reaffirming their existing beliefs
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:08:25
Imagine saying this in 2017...
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:07:17
I stopped checking the price after 2018
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:06:50
Good. We need a shakeout for price to go up again
@_date: 2019-11-14 09:29:34
Survivorship bias is strong
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:07:43
New? Thats nothing lol
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:24:16
Thats why they are broke /s
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:54:37
Thats actually quite optimistic I’d say. I wonder if we’ll ever be ath again...
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:27:40
Never, bakkt is a meme at this point
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:30:25
I mean people are panicking because of a 7% drop...you’d think people know how volatile bitcoin is by now. Oh well
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:36:47
Next year we will be for sure
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:31:15
Sure buddy, can we hold you accountable if you’re wrong?
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:05:06
This is some serious math fail
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:58:17
Congrats to all who bought the dip! I was too scared.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:36:58
If it’s like gold then yes
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:42:51
Last chance to buy at 8.3k!!!
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:29:35
Ltc has taken over bch multiple times lol
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:35:13
@_date: 2019-10-07 10:05:26
Yes, you will owe money to the CEO of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:08:22
They arent, it will dump much harder. Last chance to sell high!
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:48:30
Maxing out all my 3 cards and the credit line asap
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:21:48
wtf? already?
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:06:58
Im waiting for the real dip. Im not buying above 8k
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:51:04
Oh yea remember when everyone could predict bitcoin accurately? Me neither
@_date: 2019-10-21 13:46:33
So does Canada...but it doesn’t apply in this case.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:14:19
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:43:34
Lmao impatient loser detected
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:00:29
India is such a backwards shithole
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:46:45
History is guaranteed to repeat in exactly the same way
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:52:15
Are you a billionaire yet?
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:35:06
I definitely regretted not buying early 2018 dips..oh wait
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:12:03
Maybe coinsquare?
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:04:37
That's not how it works, ever. Stop using this support/resistance garbage
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:47:37
20% now
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:06:41
This is exactly why people buy bitcoin, this right here, to not depend on dipshits like you
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:02:02
Waiting for 8k
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:01:29
Yes, always. Depressed when up, down or flat
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:48:49
Pullback at 30k
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:19:54
To be sure, you could argue that the Harvard study doesn’t apply to bitcoin, since the researchers focused on the stock market rather than cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:45:02
I haven't seen this guy in a while!
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:09:05
He invented the United States
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:42:17
Lmao im not selling until i can retire, so unless we reach 200k+ im not selling
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:28:00
This could use better editing
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:28:14
You mean like the time it couldnt possibly go below 6k and then dropped to 3.1?
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:46:52
Yea just wait till you're on your deathbed. We moon then!
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:28:45
Thats how no one buys
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:39:32
Last chance to sell before 4k
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:30:31
No, you wait till it’s at ATH to buy, it’s the reddit way
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:43:29
20k -&gt; 3.1k, 10k -&gt; 1.5k?
I'll wait for 1.5k
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:48:39
The only trolls are the ones telling everyone to buy
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:39:04
If we fail 8k support we dropping to 6k, that’s how it works right?
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:47:16
Maybe nocoiner who sold at 20k
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:44:11
Anyone selling now is making mad cash
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:48:27
The smart ones stacked at 3.2k and already sold everything for 3x profit lol
@_date: 2019-09-28 04:50:31
Is that pure gold
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:32:09
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:25:22
Reverse moon
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:58:27
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:37:17
Yes $10 is a good deal, waiting to buy at that price ��
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:56:16
No, there is no correlation
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:25:42
Insert the James Franco picture
@_date: 2019-09-25 07:50:10
That 10 years window keeps moving. It was 10 years 2 years ago, just sayin
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:29:12
Because bitcoin definitely follows yearly patterns ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:37:50
8k support about to break
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:28:53
$10 is the buying opp
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:44:03
I called it way before. No one cares about this “bakkt”. You could trade bitcoin futures before, what’s the big deal anyway?
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:56:39
It’s overvalued above $0.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:51:01
Too busy making cartloads of money instead of holding btc bags? Lol
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:36:45
Well technically we still have 1 month 5 days assuming the “prophecy” is till end of October
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:42:51
Nvm you said well over
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:36:15
Wow, so many in Canada. Population 1/9 of US
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:29:34
Easily, 100k is conservative
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:25:55


@_date: 2019-05-29 15:50:16
China banned bitcoin like 10 times already
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:44:17
Milo is fkin worthless
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:37:51
Let’s all do it
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:53:20
Hahaha really?
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:33:15
Bcash has no reason to exist
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:42:15
$5000 please, I missed the rocket
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:35:03
Kevin OLeary is a moron
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:09:49
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:54:05
The ruling class wants to keep it that way
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:45:16
You wish
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:44:48
Who cares, if we are hitting higher lows, all good
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:32:54
Because fomo is strong. People invest on feelings, if market is green everyone is buying, if red everyone is selling. When btc was 4k no one was buying, general sentiment was really negative and everyone on reddit said its going to 2k. Smart people were buying during that time
