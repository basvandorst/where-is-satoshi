If it's dead, sell me your BTC.

True. They could work based on angles and size though. All are the same size and they could be part of a bigger shape.

Yup, I already tried different variations of this. Look back through my post history, I uploaded a screenshot.

I have a friend that would do that for fun and a small amount of BTC. He would say "Hey, here's a challenge. Have fun!"

Seriously.

I'd also like to know this.

I assume she's on the list, but there are no matches?
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:22:44
How did you determine that these are the only pairs of valid mnemonic pairs?
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:25:31
I have absolutely no idea how you came to that conclusion. But I've been working on this for far too long and my brain is just seeing letters now.

Other BIP39 words that match that angle are
Anyone that wants to try to make pairs out of that is welcome to try. I can't make any sense of it.
Attack _ early /
Other BIP39 words that match the angles are just too damn many. And it wouldn't make any sense anyway because they are two different angles.

Ah okay. I printed the picture and blacked out every word that's not on the official wordlist. I ended up with the following pairs -
System first
also coin
trust one
save power
law almost
PHysical group
spreads odds
hour minimum
valid verify
need network
problem proof
rely pool
find post
main split
special used
place gold

OP did reply to a comment "Try +1" so you may well be onto something here!

The only hint that I want to know is do I have to do math? Because if that's the case, someone else is certainly going to figure it out before me. If it's something else then I'll keep working at it.
Also, I bet these guys are having a fucking blast watching us all go down different rabbit holes.

You can create a private key from mnemonics that you choose.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:53:03
Same. I now have lots to catch up on the I usually do on the weekend.

I think you're right. The non-root words form a coherent and obvious sentence. Then use the root words to get the seed. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:45:32
This guy is correct, that's how you test it. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:52:53
The only thing I can think of is that they are crossed out by a notdef which basically means "symbol not found." So not lost and 25, instead of lost and 257? Maybe I'm taking this too literally.
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:04:43
I have no idea what to make of that but it is damn cool.
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:00:29
That may be the $8000 question.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:37:58
I think my brain is broken now.
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:49:39
Damn. I tried your 24 words sorted by first instance in the whitepaper and number of instances in the whitepaper. All invalid mnemonics.
