How private will my source code be?

No, please. Sounding like a dick is a symptom of curiosity. Let us walk up to the rabbit hole and gaze downward together at what BTC is currently bringing us:
1. Starting companies and acquiring/spending venture capital is no longer hard. Previously, you had to be either rich or connected, or jump through an elaborate MVP+networking+pitch+corporate bartering dance that has a steep learning curve. Today, you can simply [present your plan]( and ask investors to send BTC to an address. The entity described in the last sentence gathered [5000+ BTC]( in funding, worth over $4.5mil at the current exchange rate.
2. You can do business with whomever you damned well please with nothing more than a QR code/address on your website. Sure, its a niche market right now, but the latest news from bitpay is [$100m processed in 2013]( Divide that by their 13,000 merchants, and you're looking at over $7000 per merchant. Some are undoubtedly pulling in 6 figures in BTC transactions alone. This is the fifth year of bitcoin. Credit cards have been around for ten times that.
3. Every $1 sent over bitpay saves a typical restaurant over $0.02 in [merchant fees]( When you consider the average profit margin for a restaurant being [around 2-3%]( this results in an almost doubling of profit for payments in BTC. Start a taco cart and plant it next to a [high-traffic BTC location]( and you're making a significant fraction more than the guy standing across the street.
4. Third world citizens can buy and sell things without having to carry cash. This is huge. [2.5 billion ADULTS do not have a bank account]( Suddenly, you can ship your goods and wares to people nearby without the slowness of having to go person-to-person to collect money. [M-pesa]( proves the market exists for this service, serving as a transport mechanism for [11% of Kenya's GDP]( Drop down to minimal fees with BTC and you're taking home twice the grain of the previous month.
The list goes on and on. Bitcoin is the first layer of the Financenet. Add some more functionality on top of the first layer of the Internet and you get torrents, web traffic, streaming video, even iMessage. Add some more functionality on top of bitcoin and who knows what will sprout up. It took time for the Internet to penetrate most of the first world; it's still making its way into the third. The Financenet will wash in as rapidly as its parent, if not more so. Soon enough, the benefits will trickle down to consumers in the form of more choices from small businesses, lower prices and redistribution of wealth from large "trusted entities" (banks) into the distributed trust of the blockchain. Remember that time when [500,000 Americans lost their jobs right before Christmas?]( Ctrl-Z, motherfucker. Keep questioning things until you accept them. Thanks for the cj callout, buddy. Watch your step -- the first one's a doozie.

That part's always bugged me as well. I want a system where it works 99% of the time within 5 seconds. With the instant verification method, there's the chance that someone will buy a pack of gum and a slushie, then double-spend that $3 elsewhere. Retail has already dealt with this issue via closed-circuit cameras. Steal $5, go to jail for 30 days. Unless we get a blockchain with 5-second blocks (just shoot me now), there will be a chance of this type of fraud. Honest people are repeat customers. Dishonests, well, they're a cost of doing business on this planet.

The definition of 'worth' is the objective here. Apple makes sexy devices and makes the owners of these devices experience positive emotions. The giving of positive emotions is what makes Apple its revenue. Same goes for bitcoin. Bitcoin allows for secure transfers of wealth between private parties at an extremely low cost, providing a positive emotion for those at both ends. Positive emotions = worth. 'Worth' is rewarded by streams of revenue.
