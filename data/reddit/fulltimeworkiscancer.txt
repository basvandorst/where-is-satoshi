We've mooned already. Can someone edit the gif to make it go past the moon into the stars?

Interesting. So what does that block size mean? I'm just trying to become more knowledgeable about the whole thing.

What does it mean on bitcoin.org when it says "This wallet gives you full control over fees. This means that this wallet allows changing the fees after funds are sent using RBF or CPFP." 
What is RBF or CPFP?
Do you know of a good alternative wallet for iOS? Also a good desktop wallet that lets you control fees on Mac?

Invest whenever you want. you can buy fractions of a coin. If you're going to do small investments over time just keep track of them so you know what your price per coin is. your average. If you buy .5 coin at 4k and .5 coin at 8k your cost avg = 1btc at 6k. that way you have an idea of how you're doing when you look at the price. But as with all investments. a fuck ton invested at the lowest possible point is best. 
I got in when it was above 4k. and when the china FUD happened it dipped so i bought more at 3.3 to bring my average down. its not rocket science right?
