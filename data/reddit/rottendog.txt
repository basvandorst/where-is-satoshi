Is it bad that this was the first article I saw?

I was going to say, they make it sound so bad, but wouldn't it just be prudent to have a plan B if the talks fell through?  I mean if they did fall though they would HAVE to have a way to operate and better for them if it was ready and in place.  And if it wasn't used..no big deal, better safe than sorry.

I know realistically it was the only *logical* plan.  I'm saying no matter what, why wouldn't they have a backup plan in case the talks were just so bad that they couldn't do it, they'd need a Plan B. It would just make sense.  Even a bad backup plan is better than no backup plan.

It takes like 25 times as many positive comments to outweigh 1 negative.  People tend to focus on the negative.
