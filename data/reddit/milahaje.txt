My god only three hours? Be patient, when you mine or buy gold, its not instant as well but take days. And you dont even own it in most cases. I would wait even day to get my bitcoin confirmed but i hope development will go the right way to increase the transaction capacity with respect to security. But we all need to be patient. Bitcoin must stay secured in the first place.

I was neophyt and i started using paper wallets after one month. My first used wallet was breadwallet and i still store less than one btc there. But paper wallet Generated offline, then using bip38, is in my opinion best option - never had any problem or difficulities. I would say hardware wallets are more difficult for noobs. With paper wallet you get berter understanding how btc works.

Can you explain what you mean with that change, please? All i do is generate address, send funds,  hold funds, withdraw funds, use new paper wallet. Or am i missing something?

Why not paper wallet for long term storing? Free, safe, easy to use and handle.

15 billions market cap is brutally undervalued for invention like this. I am hodling, buing and will buy even if one bitcoin is for 20 000 dollars.

Well I agree. At this time bitcoin is the digitaĺ gold. And you dont pay with gold. Keep it for yourself, gift someone with that but dont pay with that. You will buy car with bitcoin and tomorrow you can buy two cars.
