The TPP is sold as free trade and 90% of it is considered great and wonderful for all those involved... but the 10% that concerns people is so egregious, so outrageously, insanely dangerous that it's paused proceedings for years as deals are hammered out and conversations are had between interests... but those things that were concerning were so concerning that people question not only the sanity of those that proposed it, but what the true motivations were of those that wrote it and those that lobbied to have it passed, including politicians that carried it - Like Obama.
Those small aspects were so outrageous that it brings into question not only their loyalty to their country but to the future of the human race.
I can't give you the specific details right off the top of my head - but I can tell you that these were the concerns and these were the reactions to the concerns, legitimised in part by the secrecy initially in the process. 
If I had to give you a TL:DR basically it put private corporations in the driving seat regarding regulation that transcended a nations sovereign powers.

I hope I don't get downvoted to hell for this but I've often wondered if the powers that be would actually prefer there to be a cashless society.
It gives them much more control over an individual's finances when you take cash out of the picture.
This isn't even directly related to bitcoin specifically.
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:09:41
But bitcoin can be traced, tracked and or subverted much easier than cash surely?

It's going to increase in value. 
By April/ May. it will probably reach it's highest point of this year. 
If you look at it's overall growth its been pretty predictable. The thing that threw everybody for a spin was that ludicrous spike that made millionaires out of people overnight. It gave everyone a totally unrealistic expectation of growth.
Now we have a suitable metric and you can clearly see the trend.
@_date: 2016-06-22 06:13:54
No way. Look at the total life span of bitcoin. It's pretty clearly in the 'Return to Mean' phase.
In fact I predicted a few years ago that this was exactly what would happen, when it happened. My friends were asking me if I should invest when I was telling them that bitcoin will return to growth in mid-16. It departed from the mean in 16... but in terms of its overall lifespan it almost fits perfectly into this graph and the beartrap phase ended a long, long time ago.

My worry is that crypto currency will be used by the state to remove anonymous transactions in the future. That is terrifying.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:10:44
That kind of money would change my life.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:12:12
What I am saying is that digital currency as a concept will not be anonymous in the future. It just won't be and bitcoin is a foray into that arena. If and when it is adopted there is absolutely no way that the authorities, the establishment, the powers that be, the fucking illuminati - whatever you want to call them... are going to tolerate that. That is a terrifying scenario. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:41:52
It doesn't matter what digital currency you use... the fact is we are handing over anonymous transaction. I am enthused and interested in the concept of bitcoin as much as the next guy... but I hope I don't have to explain to people why cryptocurrency is fucking terrifying. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:18:02
The idea of a cashless society, even though its the direction we are going, is seriously concerning.

I think it should be abundantly clear that day trading with bitcoin is unfathomably stupid. If you can't afford to lose then you shouldn't be investing. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 19:35:54
Yeah don't be fooled into believing you can make bitcoin transactions without there being the possibility of it being traced. This is the most concerning thing regarding cryptocurrency for me.
If you are an enemy of the state you can go off the grid (relatively speaking) and still use cash (for now) and not have to be too concerned about that transaction being traced.
@_date: 2015-08-08 08:06:17
And how soon do you think it will be before this is rolled out across the entire country on a federal level? 
They can't control people printing their own money either... good fucking luck getting away with that.
I strongly suspect that bitcoin is going to usher in a digital currency age and that is frankly dangerous as fuck when it eventually does become as centralised as regular currency is now. 
It's one thing have a piece of paper that you can trade for goods and services anonymously without government oversight. Good luck trying to survive if the government just turns your shit off.

And now this makes me instantly skeptical of the mainstream banking establishments plan for Bitcoin or something like Bitcoin. 
I strongly suspect that something related to bitcoin like technology will be used to get rid of paper cash, to create a more controlled cashless society. This is a real concern for me and when I see someone like Bill Gates promoting bitcoin it instantly makes me paranoid.

I don't think the price stabilization and increase *over the last few months* has anything to do with what's going on in the eurozone. When you look at the data, the extreme price fluctuations that have occurred are due to market manipulation and extreme conditions - either a country threatens to ban bitcoins or some pundits lauds bitcoins as the second coming of Jesus. 
If you look at all the data we have so far, and ignore the extreme fluctuations between October 2013 to late April 2014 what you see is a pretty stable, pretty predictable price increase that will only continue barring there are no outside interference as we've seen before.
My facebook status at the beginning of this year recommended that people purchase bitcoin because the price will stabilize in April/ June barring any outside interference, and like magic it did. Not because I'm some economic mastermind, but because I just looked at the data and saw the obvious trend.
Now what makes what's going on in Europe so dangerous is because bitcoin, once again, is being presented as a messiah for all of Greece's problems... it isn't and we need to be careful that we don't present it as such. Prices are going to react to European situation but we have to be cautious, and frankly skeptical, if it starts to rapidly break the trend.
And if the price does sky rocket get those fingers ready on the sale button because you could be in for a tidy profit... just be prepared for another recovery period before it returns to form and the predictable "bitcoin is dead" mantra that will undoubtedly follow.

I'm not talking about the entire world cooperating... I am talking about specifically world super powers cooperating... that could pool resources necessary to subvert other, smaller nations, even if those other smaller nations had assistance against such an attempt.


I'm not even talking specifically about bitcoin, but digital currency in general, and this scenario could easily take place 50-100 years in the future when it is ubiquitous.

I'm seeing an increasingly concerning attack, not so much on the system of banking itself, but on cash money, in the digital currency community. I think it's important not to conflate the two. Cash money is enormously valuable to our free society. While the system of banking is obviously deeply flawed and corrupt, cash money offers us anonymous exchange.
The value of that anonymity cannot be overstated. With digital currency we risk sacrificing that anonymity and handing over a huge degree of freedom to those in power. If you think Bitcoin or any other digital currency is going to remove those in power or make them obsolete, I think that's a pretty naive appraisal.
When I can have my funds turned off and I can no longer purchase food or services, you are living in a dictatorship and that is exactly what digital currency risks providing.
Cash is essential, until we can figure out a way to guarantee anonymous transaction I think it's enormously dangerous and irresponsible to conflate the current corrupt system of banking with paper cash.
Inb4 - yes we use mostly cards now-a-days... but cash is always an option and while your bank can also be shut down, it's still possible to engage in transaction outside any of these systems.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:31:37


Bitcoin isn't going to avoid this though. Governments and corporations and the financial sector aren't going to tolerate it. They will find a way to make sure it sits within the system they are happy with.

It should be clarified that certain technologies do demand some degree of concern however. This quote offers little in terms of nuance regarding all technologies, like AI and or digital currencies. Which, while they may be the future... demand a responsible degree of consideration in terms of their implementation in order to avoid exploitation.
It was invented before I was 30. Bitcoin itself doesn't concern me. A cashless society does concern me however. While bitcoin may be a cryptocurrency... the fact is, regardless of what people think... it's anonymity, should authorities wish it, can be broken. All transactions can be traced and we already see this kind of totalitarian surveillance taking place with finance today.
Where a dollar bill 50 years ago provides absolute anonymity, today a bank card, or "digital currency" allows for your daily activities to be traced and, more concerning, your finances to be frozen. 
Yes - I am aware that this sort of thing can happen today... but there is a difference between a system which still provides access to paper money and a system in the future where a persons finances are intrinsically tied to a single persons identity. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 08:00:39
So bitcoin's anonymity is completely concrete?
@_date: 2015-11-26 23:35:14
One thing I am concerned about is the idea of total digital currency and economy. I know that we are transitioning that way, bitcoin or not... but it is a scary thought that where with paper money anonymity and operation outside the system can occur without being easily traced if you so wish... that if you were to be a pariah for whatever reason and you were stuck in a digital system... you would be without a way to buy goods and services.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:37:57
I understand bitcoin. I'm not convinced.
I mean I'm convinced it could one day act as a viable currency once it's smallest units are large enough... but I am seriously concerned with the prospect of a non-anonymous currency with which authorities can essentially track everything we do.
When your money has an off switch and a commentary of your actions, that should be a serious concern for everyone. The biggest virtue of cash is that people can engage in transaction without the endorsement of the authorities. The potential for a totalitarian government to abuse a digital currency is scary to me.
@_date: 2015-11-23 18:28:17

I wonder how long this idea that we are the good guys will persist? 
I think the problem is everyone agrees, Americans want to be the good guys because its what we were raised to believe and most Americans have that in their hearts. 
The problem is those that used this lie to orchestrate their own agendas obviously weren't good guys and we have to come to terms with the fact that this is still going on.
There for the only real way we can be ACTUAL good guys is to get rid of the bad guys that lie to us... to do that requires a monumental shift in our lives in order to act on those principles.

Why does the news use every down tick of Bitcoins value as a death knell. Are they retarded? In April 2015 when it was at an all time low when people said how silly it was that anyone would ever use such a thing, the trend clearly showed what was coming and every dip between then at it's all time high a month ago saw exactly the same stupid articles being written.
Trading on bitcoin is reckless and had I had the money to do so I would have done, knowing full well the risks because the trend TO ME was clear... but I absolutely would not have been left dumbfounded had I lost money. The trend is clear, don't trade on bitcoin thats stupid... but don't bet against it either, that would be equally stupid and most of us have nothing to lose in that case, but there are a lot of institutions who could be missing out on billions by not ACCEPTING the writing on the wall.
I don't even like bitcoin. I think it is another step towards a cashless society and that terrifies me.

Anonymity is a shield for people from tyranny. 
One day all your transactions will be tracked and traced and if the government deemed it necessary, they could cut you off.
They can do that now, technically... but you always have cash.
What will be the alternative without cash?
@_date: 2016-05-30 05:01:46
But I can walk into a store, give someone notes and leave and it will be accepted and my identity is irrelevant to the person making the sale. 
Compared to a digital currency where that data is instant in nature. My identity can be made known instantly when a transaction is attempted. Even if the infrastructure doesn't exist for law enforcement to instantly react to that data, it absolutely will be in the future and, as I said... my finances are intrinsically tied to my identity.
An example of this is the movie "The Fugitive" with Harrison Ford. If you aren't familiar with the film - he's a doctor falsely accused of murdering his wife and goes on the run. His work colleague believes in his innocence and decides to help him by giving him cash because he can't use his cards, for obvious reasons. In a cashless society this scenario would not be possible. It's only an example but it illustrates the hopelessness of a group of people that could find themselves persecuted by a state agency that has total control over a digital currency - which would no doubt be the case if a cashless society were to be implemented. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:49:03
My concern is not with security... its what the state will eventfully do with crypto currency. The potential for the elimination for anonymous transaction is extremely dangerous.

Banning cash is the dream of a technocratic totalitarian state.
It effectively eliminated anonymous transactions.
