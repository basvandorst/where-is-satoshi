I'm not 100% sure but I bought some coins off of some guy that was using a Trezor and it just looked like he plugged it in entered a code, selected an amount and ask for my wallet address.

100% recommend using Localbitcoin I bought some coins off of some dude (Face to Face) &amp; he ended up being really cool. Found out he was a verified trader so there was no limit to how many BTC I could buy and all he  charged me was £20 on top of the current going price. My point is that you can come across some really interesting people via Localbitcoin that make it a lot easier to buy BTC than buying off of an exchange in my opinion anyway ... All these exchanges will make you jump through hoops to buy big amounts of BTC, wanting to know your blood type and all of that shit.. (nah I'm playin) Now with Localbitcoin all you need to do is look for a seller with good feedback, a good price you are willing to pay and call them and haggle, if they sound like their chatting some serious smack then hang up and try another person it's that simple.

Local bitcoin would be in my opinion the best shout. That's where I usually go, you have no limits on how much can buy
