High trading volume is exactly what brought the exchange reporting down, and it went down at an inopportune time. This isn't according to my imagination, it's according to the article itself.
Yeah, your architecture is cool, and bravo on utilizing PGP. I also respect you for running a competent business. But you're doing you and your business a disservice with your attitude.

Taxes are stealing. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can free yourself.
I'll be goddamned if I'm going to move away from my homeland just because some fucking assholes in D.C. wants to build another 100 predator drones.
The USA didn't even have an income tax until after 1900. We don't have to live this way, we can live free. I will utilize bitcoin as a tool to enable my freedom.

It's different. One is an armed gang of thugs that force you to pay taxes or else they'll incarcerate you. The other is nature itself which dictates that you need to work in order to survive.

Why not let your insurance company offer a fire fighting service? Insurance companies would certainly be incented to protect the property they insure.
The market can be very creative. Don't let violent traditions cloud your vision of our potential.

Thanks for the concern! I am indeed using tor. I don't trust reddit not to turn me in after they bowed to legal pressure regarding other matters.
I actually just conduct all my bitcoin related business using tor. It's better to never tie a real identity your bitcoins if you want to keep them.

No no no, you have it backward. The government steals from us, and then gives us some of our stolen money back in the form of services that we're required to use because they've been monopolized (roads, police, etc.). I will happily let the theft-funded roads crumble so that a free-market solution to transportation can arise.
A slave that uses his master's property to run away is no thief.
Incidentally, I still do pay for roads in the form of gas taxes. I hope one day I can buy gasoline with bitcoins though!

I'm glad you acknowledge that revolt is a valid response to thuggery. I am peacefully exercising this right by deciding not to pay into the system.
It won't take a majority. The US revolution of 1776 involved only about 5% of the US population.
I think a few years ago I was where you are. I would have said things like "there are a lot of areas that the government could improve upon, including taxation". Then I slowly realized that these things *cannot* be improved upon from within the system. The system is rigged, the corrupt have too much power that they will not let go of. I went through many years of stark cynicism. Then I discovered bitcoin, and I learned the solution: kill the system by depriving it of its funds.

More than 50% of our taxes go toward funding wars of aggression overseas. I'm not comfortable with my money being used to kill innocent Pakistani children.
All the services you mention aren't paid for with federal taxes, they're paid with local property taxes. I also believe that if the government would just get out of the way, all of those services could be provided for by the market.

By that logic, the absolute bottom was 4 years ago when the genesis block was first mined.
There have been a ton of innovations since then, and also a ton of innovations in the past 10 months. Also, $4.00 was significantly under-priced at its time, because the bubble was still fresh in people's minds.
I might agree with you that $18 is too high, but it's certainly not going back down to $4, unless something catastrophic happens.
@_date: 2013-02-08 23:14:39
Sorry, but this is the endgame of bitcoin. Bitcoin protects the little guy from the two major wealth confiscation measures put in place by our rulers: taxes and inflation.
I do agree that you may not want to shout it from the rooftops yet, but this is the reality.
@_date: 2013-02-08 21:52:26
Regardless of the technicalities of how the funds are distributed, I don't believe in funding anything with stolen money. This is why I am striving to not have my money stolen from me.

Good point. Don't admit anything if your reddit handle is tied to your real identity.
But if you're anonymous, it can help to know that there are other out there participating in civil disobedience along side you. That is why I started this thread.

I think you mis-understand what I was getting at. The government are the criminals, not the peaceful individuals trading on SR. The peaceful traders are finally empowered to trade without the government imposing its will on them.
Technology has historically forced rulers to give up certain powers back to the people. Bitcoin will force them to cede their control of commerce, because enforcement will be impossible.
@_date: 2013-02-09 10:36:41
It all comes down to force. Whether it's more efficient to utilize slave labor doesn't matter. Once you cede control of your life to a ruler, that ruler will abuse their power.
@_date: 2013-02-09 11:17:01
I don't believe so. Organized criminals seem to have taken over everywhere. Fortunately, technology and human progress work against these criminals, and now with bitcoin we finally have the ability to actually be free!
@_date: 2013-02-09 11:33:17
Thanks for the tip! I'll be super-sure to report it on my tax forms next year ;)
Now I feel compelled to go out and tip a bunch of people myself.

And, I'm not the only one! I subscribe to a philosophy called Voluntaryism. Philosophers have actually devoted their entire careers to rationalizing self-ownership.
And the most exciting thing is that, with bitcoin, we finally have the technology that empowers us to avoid our aggressors and live voluntary lifestyles if we so choose. It's a great time to be alive.

Just because the thieves give you back some of your stolen money (in the form of forcibly monopolized services) doesn't mean it's not theft.
There is no such thing as a social contract. I never signed one, and neither did you.
It sounds to me like you've bought into the cultural delusion that government and its taxes are what provide prosperity. Break yourself from this delusion. Break down the problem into it's logical parts, and you'll see that the government is nothing more than a gang of thugs - their only power comes from the fact that everyone *believes* they have power. I don't believe it though, and once you've reasoned through it, I think you'll reach the same conclusion.

If it's not reporting orders, then it wasn't functioning as a proper exchange. 
Their biggest company, S.Dice, had just released an earnings report, and investors were keen on trading shares of it. It sure adds a lot of difficulty in trading if you don't know the market price.
And, rather than just coming out and issuing a proper post-mortem, like most companies would do, Popescu goes on about how his architecture is superior to every single other company's, how it's immune to DDOS attacks, immune to phishing, and oh yeah, we were down for a little bit last night. Hint: you're not immune to DDOS's if trading volume can take you down.

If you can't afford insurance, then move to a less expensive domicile. It's irresponsible to be un-insured, and it's certainly selfish to *force* your neighbors to pay for your liabilities.

It actually bottomed out at $2, so it's more like a 1000% increase. It does seem large, but there has also been substantial and real improvements to the entire ecosystem since then: millions of venture capital dollars have been invested in companies like bitpay and coinbase. Gambling has become a successful and major use-case. There haven't been any major security breeches in a while (there have been a few, but nothing as large as the Mt. Gox breech was).
I think a lot of people share the same opinion that they would buy in the $12-14 range (myself included). But as we saw with this dip, there are also a lot of people that will happily buy in at $18.
If I had to guess, I think $18-20 will be the new normal for a few months. Then they'll be another wave of news, and we'll see an adjustment at that point depending on whether the news is positive or negative.

Yes, June 17th is after the drop, but my memory is that the actual leak occurred well before June 17th - there were whispers and rumors on IRC for a long time. I wish I could find a real source though.

You should check out SR some time just to see it for yourself - it's a wonderment of the free market.
The Armory (the division of SR that sold guns) was shut down due to lack of use. Kiddie porn isn't traded because it is explicitly banned by the admins (self-regulating markets!).
Also, as a point of clarification, *trading* guns is peaceful. Using them to harm others is when the peace breaks down.

I'd really like to see this contract so I can see what it actually says, rather than just having it ever-mutating, and always used as an excuse to take more of my rights away.


I am trying to make two separate points - one is the fact that they use force, and the other is the fact that they're *allowed* to use force. They're only allowed to use force because most people are under the delusion that their force is legitimate.


Prosperity comes from value creation. In general, the government leeches from this value creation, and then uses its stolen wealth to convince the masses that it was the creator of the prosperity. Hence, the delusion. 
I will admit that governments *can* do some good, but that good is despite their evil nature, and a non-government entity could do the same good without the evil.


I don't take for granted the things society has done for me. I love the modern age, and I am thankful for all those that came before me to allow me to live in a time of such prosperity. 
But, society is not equal to the government - do not conflate the two. I am not thankful for the things the government steals from society and the atrocities it commits, and I aim to put an end to it.

You're probably right. I doubt that a nebulous rumor of a potential hack would have caused the burst. It's funny how memory works though - I really thought the hack occurred before the burst (and it seems I'm not the only one), but research seems to show otherwise.
@_date: 2013-02-09 22:30:28
There were two hacks. The first hack was a dump of all Mt. Gox usernames and hashed passwords (most were using a weak MD5 hash). This hack wasn't widely announced. 
Later, there was a second hack, which was a more publicly visible because the hacker initiated a massive sell order which sent the reported price down to zero. This hack occurred on June 19th, and when the exchange came back up a week later, there wasn't actually that much of an effect on the price. Take a look at [this chart]( to see.
I don't quite remember the order of events, but I do believe that the first hack occurred before the bubble burst, so it may have been a contributing factor.
Unfortunately though, it's difficult to find any real evidence on the first hack. [This article]( was the best I could find. It states:


I do remember hearing rumors of the leaked database well before June 17th - but I can't find any evidence to back this up. Anyone have a better source of information on the first hack?

I will say that there is ample opportunity to earn bitcoins. The market is wide open, and it seems that early adopters are dying to spend their coins on anything and everything. Just make sure you stay anonymous from day one.
The more people that have a steady stream of bitcoin income, the more resilient the bitcoin economy will be.
