Ego in humans was great in the past as it helped us survive or at least it helped the fittest to survive. I don't think that paradigm is necessary nowdays and we can see some people shifting from that.  
Of couse it's naive to think all humans are going that direction. I believe large percentage of them are still in "fight for me" mode. I just believe next step in human evolution has emerged and it will ultimately have impact on everyone.  
Bitcoin will help us all regardless of what we believe as technologies are mostly neutral. I just think it's very hard to go forward with mentality from the past.   
It's insane how ego of one man (Greg Maxwell) created such "movement" of hate towards different opinion and/or vision. /bitcoin just hate whatever /btc says and the whole /btc subreddit is just reaction on Greg's ego. He is lucky that he is very smart in some ways but as you said ultimately human. I believe in the long run he will hurt himself as ego is selfdestructive. It wants to suffer.    
 
We can do our part by being aware of this insanity and either help current players to realize it or support new party who won't have the same flaws.

I couldn't agree more.

It's only short term solution. That's why we need both. You just use same rhetoric that is common here.   
If it was enough, it would already be activated and people would agree on it.

You are right. Only through challanges system can be hardened. We just should keep insanity in certain levels so it won't destroy whole system. In other words if we go too far and reach point of no return, system will perish.

Read it again.

Fees would have to be huge. Insane.   
Plus you need to solve malleability to allow new layers on top of bitcoin.  
I mean how is it even possible people are trying to push this idea? Crazy...

Right now we are working hard to destroy ourselves. I simply don't get it. The end goal is clear to everyone - segwit + bigger blocks + second layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:55:59
Lol, you are celebrating? This is beyond me. Ego over rational approach
We need more scaling anyway and LN and Segwit will take months/years to be able to fully use.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:38:38
Yep, I feel the same. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:50:50
Why? You really believe 1mb is enough to power the whole Word? Even with LN it simply won't be enough. Try to do a math.

Or r/Bitcoin sits with economic majority 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:59:29
Well, there is definitely more but r/Bitcoin nor r/btc doesn't represent bitcoin community anymore. Early adopter days are almost gone. Economic majority is taking over - for the better or/and the worst.
It will be chaos as hell.

Very nice! It's not about us vs them mentality. We should cooperate on this. Glad there is still some hope and reason here. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:13:30
Same boat

Try cointoli.com 
I use it for a while. Buyers don't have to register.
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:51:08
I agree. I just want some party that we will vote for in decentralized way for this one change. We clearly have not moved much without it. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:52:12
How can you communicate with them? How can they communicate with other parties?
