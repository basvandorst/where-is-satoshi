You don't think a bot-run pump and dump can happen again?

Hacked -&gt; i wish this word was used correctly more than 1% of the time.
But you may be right. This could be a valid old person concern.

I actually work for a child company of Alibaba, and I can verify that it's not only Bitcoin being targeted.

I'm the Director of Bitcoin. It's definitely a company.
@_date: 2014-08-16 06:01:12
It's just an assumption based on TA

Huh ok.
The weird thing that puzzles me is that we don't need more hashes/s. How much is another PHash adding to the security of the network? If you think about that, energy efficient chips are nice, but it doesn't necessarily prevent the networks energy use. It does probably mean that miner's can turn over a profit easier until difficulty grows again.

Director of Bitcoin here, Bitcoin is awesome. That is all.

You'll either get a 100 comments, or 100 downvotes.

Director of Bitcoin here.
Sorry, we are not hiring at this time

Director of Bitcoin here. Can confirm that I am the Director of Bitcoin.

I think bitfinex is incredibly beneficial to the bitcoin market. It's not like this crash came out of nowhere. We watched as many people took long positions on margin.

I thought there can only be one CEO of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:21:09
Didn't you get the memo? 
@_date: 2014-08-15 07:29:46
Shh. Dont give everything away yet.

For your family members, I recommend waiting for the ETF before investing.

This guy knows how to get votes.

Really? I always see these posts and become skeptical. The amount of BTC being dumped on exchanges due to purchases is a drop in the bucket. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:56:51
Oh yeah? Well I'm the director of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:53:35
Director of Bitcoin here. 
We took a look at your resume. We'll give you a call if we have any questions.
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:32:29
It's not about the money. It's about sending a message.
Personally, I'm so fucking tired of getting ass raped by the Fed and big banks.
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:27:25
Good. I don't trust Bitcoin, but then again...I don't **need** to.
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:45:37
Save it for your kids. Dont give it to someone here..
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:55:15
Yes, I agree that we would see Bitcoin fork. However, I don't expect wide adoption to follow the "liberty" fork.
