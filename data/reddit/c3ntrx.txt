maybe you are watching the wrong branch of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:55:47
charts dont teach individuals how to use it and send and buy. I do. Charts drive people to buy through banks like coinbase or kraken

It takes people to be activists. Wont happen if people just sit back and let banks control bitcoin. banks like coinbase, polinex etc etc

Most fiat money isnt printed. There are other forms of money banks print. They are called mortgage notes, credit slips credit cards.. These are printed with a promise to pay back a percentage of money that doesnt yet exist. This is how they create money. The money is the note of Debt.

N/m i admit i did troll with that one. Were using litecoin and Doge at our Bar and ATM's. Its fast block confirms and low fees make it ideal.

Just google.. "binance kyc hack" - remember they did get hacked a while back. This might just be more of that breach surfacing. Illustrates why the whole kyc is a bad idea from the start

Segwit is a mess. core dropped the ball, the btc fork of bitcoin had gotten infiltrated long ago and gavin scared off. good luck. Long live BitCoin!
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:26:37
segwit is not bitcoin - it is dumb

We are bringing the owner up to speed. He takes cash or Bitcoin/cryptos, events we do what we do. I hope to do alot of coin exclusive stuff and tax fiat / credit card use because we can.

Its not though. You can still trade in this country service for service or thing for thing. They would rather you not do so and believe otherwise.

Actually I was in Washington DC and ate at a place they only took cards. Then again Washington DC is not part of the United States.
@_date: 2019-08-11 06:03:33
Im glad it works for you. At our Bar and ATM;s we're using Litecoin and Doge. Its faster blocks and the network isnt backlogged and congested. I cant see you ever having consensus with bitpay and others. This is why bitcoin forked in the first place.

"Bitlicense" Passing ANY law limiting what is done with art (which may include graphic representations, codes etc) is infringement on the right to free speech. Crypto can be traded by speech too. Any phrase or group of phrases or words can be a crypto key. The state is assigning arbitrary ammounts on speech art and words and fining people for using them.

I just posted mostly asians because It was easier to cover the eyes. lol j/k

We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner transfers the coin to the
next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
and adding these to the end of the coin. ~ Satoshi

I just made an arrangement to run a non "Business" event / use of part or all of the establishment. Theres nothing saying I have to use fiat. an arrangement between parties is still a private matter. Blacks defines business as  "That which occupies the time, attention, and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or profit." no labor men here hence no business.

This is a computer protocol. I keep my private key in my brain. Should they tax my brain? Anything can be value. Do you KYC bananas?

bitcoin wasnt created for a "look". that is why satoshi is anonymous
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:22:58
Thats the real consequence of sharing ALL of your most personal info with a non trusted unknown 3rd party.

it wasnt me it was satoshi

We should support each other in this community / space IMO. Instead of sitting behind a keyboard I think more of us should be on the streets. That being said I dont need yours or anyones permission to post or promote my group.
