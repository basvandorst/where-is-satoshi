That's a stretch. Also this thread is now about Jeeps, because as wealth in society increases our options in cars increases, so really, every thread about finance or technology is partly a conversation about Jeeps... If you think about it that is

Yeah. Identity politics had no part of financial decisions

So... A man who likes women... But considers themselves a women, but only enough of a women to refer to themselves as transgender rather than directly a women... Got it.

Markets crashing during every dip have prevented me from panic selling ALL THE TIME!
It sucks that I know this about myself, but the 5 minutes of refreshing gives my monkey brain time to stop and chill.

Yeah but GDAX is the highest volume for BTC/RedditGold so...

Yep! That's the whole point of the public ledger known as the blockchain!
Transactions are public and auditable. Decentralized trust

It's the most common exchange for newbs which let's be honest is 95% of crypto... That's the very meaning of adoption phase
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:28:52
This model of adoption only works assuming incoming users will own/hold similar numbers of coins as the existing user base.
This assumption had held up fairly well during the initial adoption phase because the buy in costs have remained reasonable...
Currently that is changing... This year we saw Bitcoin range from ~800-&gt;8000...
Going forward the average holding will shrink as the amount of value each user holds will remain similar, but that value will control fewer more expensive coins.
Keep this in mind when extrapolating forward based on historical data.

because reddit makes up only a small portion of bitcoin users. ... I hope... and as a community we should be sharing resources to help eachother.  Yes, if this got out it could impact prices just by volume, but if we are a small set, we can all benefit from useful tactics.

The only kill shot would be discovering a weakness in the protocol.
Any other attacks only serve to strengthen the remaining positions.
Same reason doctors make you take full rounds of anti biotics. The bacteria who survive the first round are stronger than the ones who didn't.  If you don't kill the strong ones, than the next generation will be made of only strong ones.

It seems if we interpret pi as asci, everyonce in a while it forms a valid http link. Some of those links point to child porn. Pi is illegal

Will we hit a point where it becomes profitable for Bitcoin to destabilize nation states in order to force them onto the block chain?

I only ever click these to laugh. Anyway, thanks for today's chuckle. The breakout section is what got me!

Hate to inform you, but as long as Fiat still pays taxes and bills it is ultimately King

no... every dollar pumped into the system is in direct ratio to how many bitcoin there are.  therefor if 50 bitcoin can be produced per minute (as per the difficulty algorithm) then (50*the current cost of a bitcoin -ccoabc) needs to be entering the market in that same time for the price to stay the same.  now, that money entering the system is largely conceptual as it is basically analagous to current demand for bitcoin... so, even if no group of people directly pump (50*ccoabc) if as a collective conscious, bitcoiners raise demand enough for the coins(say 1,000,000 transactions ocurring over the next day at 3 cents higher than the day before (1,000,000 *.03 == 30,000) than essentially that money has entered the system.)  If a bitcoin leaves the market, it counteracts this inflation.  Bitcoins can be lost, deleted, stolen, misplaced ect... but this will probably never happen at an appreciable rate unless a major bug hits the system... in which case a drop in confidence(demand) will play a larger role in reducing the price of a bitcoin than will the effect of lowered trading volumes from said bitcoins absence.

Your a classic form of self delusion
