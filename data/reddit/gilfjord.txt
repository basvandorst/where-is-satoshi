Find me a political party with zero drama, I'll wait.

Re read your comments up this thread. You’re clearly suggesting a diet version of “deep state” and “don’t forget Seth Rich”
Anyone with any political/internet context from the last few years can clearly see you’re driving a wedge. 
If you really are just a normal person having discussions on the internet you owe it to your fellow man to think more critically and gain more context.

I think it’s a bit disingenuous to sit at your computer in the eastern bloc and call the only party opposing the evil of resurgent fascism an evil party because you personally disagree with socialism a lot. 
My point is, as an American, spread bullshit about your own country if you must spread bullshit at all.

I dunno man, reread our comments and I don’t think I misrepresented you. 
Tell me what I missed.

So everything democrat is evil and republicans are only part bad?
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:51:42
Do you think there aren't corrupt manipulators working within the Republican party?

Not talking about op I’m talking about you. There is a clear trend coming from today’s leadership in America and its evil. Democrats have their corruption like any political party but to straight up call them evil while right wing manifesto writing psychopaths are shooting shit up left and right is fucking bullshit and you should be ashamed of either how ignorant you’re being or how misleading you’re trying to be. 
Either way that is my opinion  which I also have the right to give. It’s also informed because we’re talking about the country I grew up in, am active in its politics in, and see with my own eyes every day. 
And you can take that fascism out of quotes.

Crypto is for permission-less value exchange something Barr and Trump are not fans of. 
Evil is installing backdoors on everything for control. Welcome to the Republican Party.

Agreed. 
I'm sure coinbase has it's cracks but I've been with them since they opened and have had no issues at all so far. Always able get my money in and out fast, coin swaps are basically instant and easy, they have 4.9 stars from me until they fuck up. To qualify, I've always just been a casual DCAer with CB I'm not a user that would test their platform rigorously.
I think there are probably a lot of impatient people trying to do too much at once in crypto in general (because $$$) and when reality stands in their way even a little bit they get all butthurt and cry about it online.
That or these shitposts are weaponized 1 star reviews.
