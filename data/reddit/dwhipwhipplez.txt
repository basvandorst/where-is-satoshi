Banks are not idiot proof. They have engineered software to post payments to your account in the best way possible to draw an over draft charge. Also they charge you to hold it there. Most people in the US aren't experts on electricity or internal combustion. But we use that shit all the time. People fall for scams now anyways, but they know not to give out their bank account number or their social security number. Oh wait they don't and fuck up sometimes. People aren't that stupid, they are poor,desperate , alone, i dunno pick one. Shit like that makes you do dumb shit. I didn't know the first thing about how a bank worked either. Everything I know I was taught or figured out. Theres no expertise required here. Just to be aware of the existence and use is all thats left.

* I have waited tables for a decade and got out of the restaurant/bar industry.
* I then traveled the country installing computer systems(POS) for various restaurants bars and strip clubs. ( I would add within the system to take this money out of your payout)
* The business can charge you whatever the fuck and do with your tips as they please, as long as you 7.25/hr in the end they can do whatever they want. Their only reason for not doing so is competition keeping good employees so they don't loose them to a nicer restaurant where you could make more money.
The laws in place generally do not protect you (federal) and in my state (TX). If you want to make good tips and work for someone that wont nickle and dime you. You need to get a job waiting tables at a very nice well respected restaurant, that hires pros. 
I have worked for varied fine dinning restaurants. My last job I worked 6 days a week 5pm to 10pm and made $600 a week. Work in a restaurant that offers 5 course meals, and the menu changes on a daily basis. 
If at all possible get a job working in a bar. You will always make better money with less effort at a bar. 
Sub minimum wage has not been raised in over 20 years, it  still sits at 2.14/hr. Depending on your state you will be getting paid this, Federally it can be 2.14 so the state has to have laws for it to be hire. 
Oh yea anytime I went to my boss about how fucked up this was or cited something that was done incorrectly or illegally, I was generally fired or shifts reduced to the point I had to find another job anyways. You are better off selling drugs when you weigh risk/rewards of working in a restaurant for a decade and wasting your life.

Ron Paul nightmare? This isn't fiat money system because its not fake, limited supply of bitcoins, you can just make more bitcoins. wtf? [Ron Paul advocating bitcoin](
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:09:43
As long as they make minimum wage they can do whatever the fuck. Anything over the minimum they can for example make you tip out a bus boy.  
Don't get all butt hurt, I'm not defending owners or trying to see a law how I want it to be, its the opposite I wish it gave more protections, it doesn't. 
Regardless of the shit law that is in place they do whatever they want. Bring this up to an employer and you will be fired. 
Your right, Im wrong employers of restaurants never take advantage of poor people or ignore laws or navigate them in a way it doesn't matter. 
I was just trying to help, you rude fuck.

Ya I have been on the sub for about a year and half or so. I never post or anything. I still only half understand it. I do love seeing the price drop. Hype hype hype, to the moon! Omg its dropping! sell sell sell. I'm waiting for it to drop some more so I can by my first whole coin to hold on to.

"The employer is prohibited from using an employee’s tips for any reason other than as a credit against its minimum wage obligation to the employee."
Minimum wage obligation, hence whatever the fuck.

I think it's inappropriate because it's(bitcoin/openbazzar) going against the status-quo. Anytime this happens people immediately get defensive. Just mentioning what bitcoin is and challenging peoples ideas about what money is. This is unsettling to most people, toss in there a bunch of scary internet facts zomg child porno, drugs, and the complete corruption of our moral society. Please. This is how it's coming off. Ya in a rational mind and looking at all aspects of the subject at hand is nice, and totally agree with your assertions. If we want to get away from this near-term (morally questionable to public) uses its going to be real hard to make waves in the larger market. We all know how the media works well with business, this could be for all intents purposes propaganda. It's attaching a stigma to a technology so the culture will reject it. I cant use this tech, only drug dealers and pedos do!

^ Means you cant tell if its sarcasm a joke, a troll, or really anything. Fuck that, there is plenty of context. You can hardly tell what peoples intentions are in life much less the internet. This is a shitty internet "law". 
Read his history of comments, this is not a troll.

I've been following bitcoin since 2012, and I still don't understand magic money and im not a complete idiot. 
Blockchain, open ledger, finite amount, mathhhh, blah blah blah, zomg another post about someone losing all their bitcoins and getting hacked. Man maybe I should never buy any bitcoins... if an idiot like me with a job in IT is scared of bitcoin what hope is it for the rest of the populace?
inb4 zomg you dumby its like cash dont leave cash laying around or on an online wallet MtGox sjns;lkfssn Coinbase aljdnfslnlsdf
ahhhhh all these rules! 
Like I said I am in IT, I know how much security sucks. So much so I am moving to Linux. I did help desk for awhile and people are idiots when it comes to windows and mac. Let alone someone figure out how to use linux as their new desktop machine. 
I think bitcoin has less problems with it, and the real issue is internet security which bitcoin only resolves a marginal part. If routers are still left open, back doors, Tor exit nodes fucked with, its not gonna matter if bitcoin is encrypted when they got a fuckin keylogger on my computer. Oh shit and my VPN better be based in Russia or any place USA wont fuck with it. 
I'm all for decentralization and the public taking more control. Just kinda hard to do when you also still work 50+ hours a week. You just want other people to take the mental load. 
Sorry I felt like bitching I have never posted here or even commented. I really want bitcoin to work Im just reacting to the overall sense I get from this sub.
**TLDR; I feel like the more I follow this sub the less I like bitcoin.**

So I live in Houston and do we not have the same problems or do we just not care? My inclination is Austin taxis businesses trying to get more money. Haven't DUI's sky rocketed after shutting it down? Yay more tax money for austin and dead drunk people! 
With the way foreign taxi drivers drive here around Houston, I feel much safer having an American stranger drive me around. 
Dangers are mostly on the side of the driver. Stats say that for Taxi drivers. The biggest danger is the customer not the worker. Hell this is fuckin Texas, carry a god damn gun and sit in the backseat? 
I dunno I sell and buy shit on craigslist and I was never robbed, why would you be for a car ride?
Drumming up things to be scared about unnecessarily. You know who you should be afraid of ? Tow truck drivers, those guys are terrifying. What kind of background checks do you think those guys go thru? Im gonna guess and say none.

As far as traditional economics explains it, it's because they are substitute goods.
I can buy one coke for dollar or two pepsis for fifty cents. I buy two pepsis demand has increased. Price will increase following demand.
I don't necessarily agree with it, i think it gets a little more complicated.

Ya I know plenty, I have no interest in proving it to you. I have no incentive to. Let go of the ego battle and just go read something. I read law shit everyday, my gf is lawyer, i've worked for lawyers, ive also spent 8 years in bar industry and can also tell you, you are wrong. But ya whatever, what I said "sounded" like I didnt know what I was talking about maybe. Maybe you just have confirmation bias. "Sounds" like you don't know what you are talking about either.

well i checked it twice before calling you and idiot and because of this annoying thing called self doubt I check it again, so for the 4th time now I have checked it. You are an idiot still. But I am the bigger idiot for not having more confidence in myself and wasting my time with you. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 03:13:53
lol, i feel a since of pride but also upset you moving for the wrong reasons.

Sure and why should I have to bake a cake for you because you want to marry a person of the same sex. The list goes on and on. Id read up on the philosophy of law or anything about law. You are just asserting moral arguments with superficial reasoning. I know because I started with the same line of logic then asked my lawyer gf about it and now I see why this reasoning is kinda lame. It's a start but you need to go deeper than this. Id explain it to you but you like me probably wouldnt listen to me. Gota find/figure it out for yourself. I am sure you can find a better reasoning than this one or the one I would give.

was reference to here in the states, we had issues with gay marriage, it got legalized and a business wanted to refuse service. 
When you make a business you are servicing the public, you can not pick and choose whom you give services to. Especially when the roads to your business were paid with taxes.

its arguing over stupid shit like this why I am never using reddit to contribute on anything again. 
You dont know wtf acceptance means? Acceptance of btc as a currency, adoption, adaptation. 
There are tons of merchants who care about fees. 
source: I traveled all over the united states installing Point Of Sale systems, for restaurants, retail, strip clubs etc.. They care about fees.
Also every time I go into a corner store they have a sign, $5 minimum to use credit/debit card! 
Did you know they get kick backs from using the ATM in their store? hmmmm
You think they gonna get a fucking kick back from using BTC in their store? 
The fees need to drop for bitcoin to be ACCEPTED TO REACH ACCEPTANCE

Enjoyed the read and I believe I agree with your sentiment, that money is a disgrace to the human race. Spending carbon to make data, or paper money is pretty retarded. I am all for intelligent management of "the currency" whatever it may be. We all agree that we should maximize good, but how to maximize that good is in question. 


Correct but at that level of catastrophe no money has any value, gold really doesn't have value either, clean drinking water and food is more valuable than any shiny thing you have.

I added a bank account, and sold some btc this morning. Was a little slow but was fine, sold at $2,900. First time selling , have not seen it hit my account yet. But seems okay.
