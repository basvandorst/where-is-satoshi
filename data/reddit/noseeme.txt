The libertarian propaganda on this subreddit is annoying.

What I'm trying to say is I don't think they think that, OP was just being hyperbolic and bitchy. To put it more succinctly, "libertarian circlejerk".

Well, Ron Paul is a waste of time, so might as well try to make it about something useful like Bitcoin.

Wow. This is an incredibly difficult way to make 1 dollar.

Not my fucking problem.

How fucking paranoid are you people?

I'm pretty sure it's spelled "L-I-B-E-R-T-A-R-I-A-N P-R-O-P-A-G-A-N-D-A".

Think of is this way: What do banks do?
The two main purposes of banks is to safely keep people's money for them so they can withdraw it at a later date when they need it, and to give out loans they think can be paid back. Fractional reserve banking factors into this because the money they get from people making deposits is given to the people taking out loans. 
Let's say "Acme Bitcoin Bank" takes both deposits and give loans to people. To start, it has 1 million BTC, and someone takes out a loan for 500,000 bitcoins with a decent interest rate. This means Acme Bitcoin Bank has more than 500,000 BTC *owed* to it, but their *balance* is now 500,000 BTC.  
Word spreads about this big loan and lots of people gain confidence in Acme Bitcoin Bank. Suddenly, 1.5 million BTC flow in in deposits. The balance is now 2m BTC. Acme Bitcoin Bank itself now gains confidence and they decide they're going to give 1m BTC in loans. The balance is now 1m BTC, but the total number of deposits is 1.5 million BTC.  
The bank is now in fractional reserve territory. Something really bad happens, and suddenly all of their depositors want all of their money back in a bank. Obviously they can't pay them all back with their current balance, and the bank can't get money from anybody, so it defaults and goes completely bankrupt. This results in a lot of people getting hurt, especially the depositors. There is no FDIC or regulation for Bitcoin banking, so the depositors either have to deal with it or see what can happen if they take the bankrupt Acme Bitcoin Bank to court.
So yes, fractional reserve banking is *technically* possible in Bitcoin, but it's an especially bad idea on Bitcoin as there are few laws and regulations to protect anyone, and no central bank that can change the money supply as they see fit. There are no control mechanisms to intervene in Bitcoin's money supply, so this just means anyone doing banking with bitcoins needs to realize that bitcoins have some risks that are not present in national currency with a central bank and deposit insurer, and there are also some benefits that don't exist in national currency. The benefits are just give and take when comparing the two.

That doesn't make any sense.

Basically Wikimedia wants to keep their accounting simple, and well, accountable for record keeping purposes. Bitcoin would make this more complex than it has to be. You'll have to redeem your bitcoins for cash before donating to them, it's only one extra step, not that hard. It's easier for you to handle the conversions of your bitcoins to cash than for them to manage large amounts of volatile cryptocurrency to run a charitable organization, do them the favor, we all know Wikipedia deserves it.

Bitcoinica still stealing coins from itself?
@_date: 2012-02-16 04:02:23
Right, but that's Mt. Gox and you can buy BTC anywhere. Bitcoin doesn't require a site or anything but computers with an internet connection to operate. I don't think these are comparable, bitcoin is a currency.

Is this subreddit just a libertarian rag?
@_date: 2012-05-08 20:30:30
Well no shit that makes sense. Congress claiming they determine the market value of something doesn't make sense and doesn't seem like something that will happen. You were just being hyperbolic. Nobody likes Congress, but that's just something they're not going to do.
@_date: 2012-02-16 04:05:11
I'm not buying it. Bitcoin trading sites will always exist and are not the operators of the currency, you can't apply the same logic of this website to Bitcoin, they aren't the same thing.

The instant downvotes also answered my question. GOD YOU GUYS ARE POWERFUL.
