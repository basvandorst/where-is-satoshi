In all seriousness, [this video]( is so damn funny. Worth 10 minutes of laughter.

That was the issue I had, too. It went down to 9.2k yesterday from what I saw, but didn't capitalize on it like i should have, sadly

Just means more bitcoin for us to buy into. I was hoping it would hit 8.9k again yesterday but, meh.

Waiting for it to get to 9k hopefully. Then, I'm buying more like a sonofabitch. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:59:57
C'mon, let's get down to 10k so I have an excuse to buy more!
Edit: Sonofa.... it WAS at 10k an hour ago and I missed it!

I think once it hits $15k or $20k milestone, we should start just announcing it in $5k increments (someone posted a bit ago on this, but can't seem to find it). It's going too fast to keep up with each $1k increase, it seems. We have work to do, you know!

How does this affect someone like me who just used Coinbase to out in his first $50 in BITCOIN? Also invested 15 in Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:15:25
Just put in $50 in Bitcoin (I'm not a rich man).

If I send you 1BTC, would that cover it?

This needs to be put to the top of the Front Page to warn anyone that is even remotely invested/interested/whathaveyou in Bitcoin. Given on the price, the last thing I want to see is people being scammed by these assholes.

I'm gonna miss my Uncle King Akubar......
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:47:54
Piss off! Uncle Akubar always considered me his favorite! It said so on the e-mail!

I believe so! Did you go to the funeral? Was it nice?
