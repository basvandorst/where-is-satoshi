Family was rich generations ago.
I'm no millionaire. I'm doing ok. I lost a bunch in the 2018 drop, and the rest in a boating accident.
Can't be mad at the great grand father on my side for rejecting blood money.

Coinbase dropped shift.  Limits were too low to be useable $200/week.
Bitpay was a little more reasonable at $3k/day or maybe 10k I forget.  But I was over utilizing it and they cut me off.
