Balance is still zero.

Okay for the sake of redundancy I went through and checked every single one of my address on the blockchain.
The two address I posted earlier are the only ones with coins in them. So does that mean my final balance is actually 0.58848017 BTC?
Both my wallet and back-up wallet are saying my balance is 0.50873417 BTC ...

How do i import private keys??? I can't find the files anywhere..

I tried copying my wallet.dat file into the appdata folder for multibit but still have a zero balance, even when I use my "good" backup that has 4.6btc in it.

Opening wallet "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\wallet.dat"...
Unable to load wallet "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\wallet.dat" or backups. See help on "Wallet Backups" for more details.
The error was "com.google.bitcoin.store.UnreadableWalletException Could not read wallet".
... done.
Getting this error now...

I checked the transaction ID on the blockchain earlier and nothing came up too.

Can't send it right this second as I'm trying to do a rescan (and of course its hanging now)
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:20:13
There ya go. Still not showing up after the rescan.

Well check the address now. I just did more in-wallet transfers and now the final balance on my address is reading much higher: 
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:48:16
Definitely the correct address. I have a backup of my wallet.dat file but now it's saying I have .6BTC less than what I have in this wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:20:10
What address would I give you?
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:27:15
I haven't used a paper wallet in many months. I am using the official QT wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:03:51
These are the only address with coins and the both have the correct balances:
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:44:55
If I open the same wallet on a different computer (same wallet.dat file) I can see 4.6BTC in my wallet, however thats .6BTC less than what was in this wallet on this computer??? Idk how that is possible when the transaction histories look the same...
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:30:59
No I imported them onto my phone wallet and then transfered them over to my qt wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:00:17
Well, I managed to transfer 4BTC to a blockchain wallet which I'd assume they are safe there. 
When I do that command I can see two address with coins in them: one with 0.01 and another with 0.49
The total on the wallet I did it on is 0.5 so that makes sense in that regard.
The thing is i'm not sure how many coins I *actually* had to begin with and I'm guessing if i send too many the blockchain refuses my transaction so how could I possibly know how many I can transfer out? I would go through all my address but I have dozens and I feel like it shouldn't be this complicated 
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:23:35
Yes that is what I'm trying to do and now it was going up when I was sending coins but then it randomly sent half the balance to a random address????
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:13:49
I was originally to test out if my transaction propagated the network. They did but I think I really only had 3.6BTC to start with which is why that is all that showed up at the address i did the in-wallet transfer too.
