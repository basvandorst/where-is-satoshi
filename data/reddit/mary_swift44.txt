Ahahahah...actually, this is the correct conclusion for everyone who wants to be rich.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:01:31
Are you real holder?
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:41:15
I also often have a nightmare in which prices of all cryptocurrencies had fallen and I lose all the money that I earned during this time.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:52:36
Can someone explain why we have to do it??
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:43:39
As far as I understand, we can't influence on everything what is happening right now, so we should just take changes on the cryptocurrency market.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:56:09
Does it make you to feel like a millionaire?
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:13:03
We should to believe in the best so I convince myself that I'm investing in revolutionary technology.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:29:24
Does someone believe that this is possible?
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:29:51
I can say that all this is explained by simple laws of demand and supply on the currency market.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:55:27
Ahahahha...I think that everyone felt it!
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:40:29
Are there any restrictions on creating a new node?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:13:14
Ahahaha...you are right. It is good time now to invest in Bitcoin in order to not to regret it in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:53:51
Ahahahaha..People really lose their mind. Bitcoin is only money. Why nobody does name son euro?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:13:01
I think that it's not for a long time and Bitcoin will rise again to its previous price soon.
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:16:40
Ahahaha..You're not alone. I think that everyone who deals with cryptocurrency feel the same.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:38:30
I think it will be Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:37:51
Is it that people can't take out their Bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:27:49
If you wait even longer, the Bitcoin price will increase again and you will be left with nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:41:56
Would you send some BTC, which can be very easy to spend, to a scammer? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:27:45
Wow! I did not believe that the price of Bitcoin could fall so much.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:12:22
Thank you for your explanation! In this case, I absolutely agree with you.
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:13:02


I don't think that they choose a little-known and unstable ICO for this.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:27:48
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:48:26
Bitcoin is actually a good opportunity for investing and this story is an example of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:28:56
Which other advices do they ask you about cryptocurrencies? Maybe something is not connected with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:31:35
Perhaps you are right but the author said that everyone might find himself in such a situation. So, I hope that these money will change the life of that man for the better.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:16:19
Do you have such a thoughts about Bitcoin or about all cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:10:52
Yes you're right about cash but the Bitcoin price is very unstable. What do you think about it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:44:31
For me, this advantage is the most important. Understanding that nobody can track your account status gives you strength for future earnings.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:32:16
It's true of our life. You need an initial capital for any successful business. If you want to successfully invest in cryptocurrencies, you must have that capital.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:22:32
In fact, the fate of truth in this is but not all people are the same. 
For someone it's just a business and no more. What can you say about these people?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:41:10
I think that this can be considered another confirmation that the cryptocurrency is not a scam. If you understand the exchange rate, then Bitcoin is able to bring you a significant profit. This will be a lesson for anyone who didn't believe in investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:43:18
Bold assumption :) We will wait for four years and on this forum find out if your prophecy was true.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:20:14
I think that everyone who thought that if he or she had invested in Bitcoin two days ago, then tomorrow he or she would be rich should see this picture. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:05:47
It sounds like a good desire:) Do you really believe that Bitcoin will cost $1 million? This is actually a really high price...
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:37:19
Ahahaha...I hope it is just a very good joke! Though, in fact, there is a fate of truth in it since Bitcoin captures people and becomes their ideology.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:01:23
If this is one such story, then no, it will not convince me. But if there are many such situations and I see them on different forums, then it is possible that I will start to believe in this thing.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:52:46
Yes, I also think so. Young people want to manage their lives by themselves. And for this they need money. You have already wrote that Bitcoin is an easy way to make a profit so they invest in it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:11:54
Ahahah...As for me, it sounds very realistic in November, don't you think so?))
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:36:19
You are absolutely right. Bitcoin's price is very unstable and that money which you lost yesterday you can get tomorrow. This is okay for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:44:05
This is a good example for anyone who does not believe in the cryptocurrency and considers it a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:08:57
This is a normal situation for everyone who invests in cryptocurrency. You can have everything today and you may have nothing tomorrow. However, this risk is justified if you understand when to quit the game.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:29:48
This is actually a very cool idea to find emoji for such  cryptocurrency. I think people would use it quite often. But it should be something very cool and non-standard.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:37:05
You chose the best answer from all possible. Someone once advised me not to talk about my crypotcapital so I always say that I don't have Bitcoin but I would like to buy some.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:21:45
You forgot to add that growth of profit will increase every day:)
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:49:42
Ahahaha...you're right. Bitcoin became an example that even impossible may happen:) Although Bitcoin has grown to 1500 percent it still remains one of the best alternatives for investing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:13:07
But that's funny! Bitcoin is a 21st Century disease and dad understands this well.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:21:24
Yes, it's quite inconvenient. Using a regular Bitcoin is much easier and more convenient. Maybe there are some other options?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:40:10
Each currency, even a dollar, is a bubble that once burst. So why not catch a moment and invest in Bitcoin while you can make a profit?
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:56:03
The problem is that we still can't change anything. So, the process is already running and we can only adapt to the requirements of time...
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:03
You can pay attention to ICO but I want to warn that only Bitcoin can bring you big profit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:29:22
Everything changes. You should have been ready for this. I think that  value of Bitcoin will continue to grow in comparison with gold in the future. It is interesting only to know which maximum this value will reach.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:15:46
Did you think about the beginning of mining Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:06:53
It was just my personal interest. If you do not want to share this information, it is your choice.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:28:13
AHAHAHAHAHA...It wouldn't be so much fun if it wasn't true.
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:19:17
Ahaha..you will have to wait a bit with your plans with such a price on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:50:41
Do you think that he is a scammer or his thoughts is worth paying attention to?
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:57:27
Ahahaha...you're very critically evaluate India.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:00:34
This is just a temporary phenomenon. Bitcoin will return its price very soon.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:35:47
I agree that this is a reality, however, no matter whatever this reality is, we should adapt to it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:42:33
Oh, my gods! This is actually so! It takes a lot of time to deal with the cryptocurrency and blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:06:01
Believe me that price will change very soon!
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:23:23
This is our reality! We had already to get used to it.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:50:13
A few months ago, everyone believed that Bitcoin could cost 1 million dollars. So I think that everyone will believe in this statement a few months later.
