I just got the same mail too, with yet another BTC address with no transactions on it. I got here by googling "Bitcoin Unit Box 150". This was one of two results, the other being a post on a Pastebin-like site, with the same message and *yet another* transaction-less BTC address.
I also note that the real GABI have a phishing alert posted on their main page at globaladvisors.co.uk.
Mine came from no-reply via campaignmail.topspin.net according to the headers. Campaignmail.topspin.net is a 301 redirect to Sendgrid, which is also referenced in the email header, so I take this to be the service Topspin is using to send these. Topspin.net itself just shows a login form, but the TOS and privacy policy links lead to topspinmedia.com, which does sales and marketing for musicians and other artists.
I've reported the mail as a phish to Gmail. Since Topspin Media and Sendgrid are legit, I've also sent mail to the canonical "abuse addresses for topspinmedia.com, topspin.net and sendgrid.com, and opened a support ticket at support.topspinmedia.com.
EDIT: Yikes, SendGrid's compliance team replied in mere minutes:
