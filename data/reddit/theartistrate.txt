Frauds? Hmmm 
But what about our portfolio ? did that vanish from your memory ?
We used the wordpress template for our website woopty doo, every single piece of artwork/web designs/digital marketing we have delivered have been 100% original &amp; will continue to be.
We understand this logic may be too much for some humans but that's ok.
Thank you again for the feedback! keep it coming!
