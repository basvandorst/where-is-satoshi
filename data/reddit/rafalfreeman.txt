Nope, I actually considered all this consequences through recent years with my friends who also would like to end modern slavery:
Killing *myself* in car accident is *my own* problem.
Let's clarify, I mean when I am *alone* in my car, not when my shattered bones would hit my passenger and all (or when he is adult that consents).
About copyright, I live from creating stuff that can be copied. I do not copyright it in general. I would never agreed to have someone in jail.
Removal of intellectual slavery will make some artists earn less (btw some will make much more - especially the small to middle ones!).
But that is not even the case how much will they earn in either model.
The point is that slavery is bad.
This can be explained on a simple mind experiment.
To end world hunger I created a magic box that duplicates food that you put into it.
I drive to Africa, order one delicious pie.
Then I duplicate it million times and end hunger. 
He does have the pies in his kitchen I didn't even had to steal them from him, and I did paid for the 1 pie I ordered.
Would you have me arrested, because the restaurant owner will lose customers now and because I copies his example work? 
And this is what people did, we have this magic box to create end of world hunger for intellectual materials, but we artificially want to enslave people to keep the old model going.
Hint: in both worlds people would still hire artists/cooks because someone has too make the new stuff. Some will for free (like in linux) so will for money - all is good.

Ok there is your misunderstanding.
Anarchy does not mean "let's not have ANY FORM OF ORGANIZATION or order, lets run away burn buildings down, rape women and such" heh.
It means that YOU start as a free-person. No one can order you around. But normal rules apply, if you go and attack someone then expect he will fight back and call others to help.
Then you ELECT OWN LEADERSHIP, or subscribe / join existing club, village, city and so on.
You know, it's the good kind of rule of the people. 
The one where other people will not force their crazy arbitrary rules on you.
If group X thinks bitcoin should be legal, and Y that banned, then who is right?
They both are.
They should go on separate ways, Y will not trade in btc in their city, X will.
Democracy turns all such problems to unresolvable disputes and constant fight between people who *want different things* there is no right answer, instead we must learn to just let other be their own way.
EDIT: this is what I would like a NON-VIOLENT anarchy to be.
Anarchy also could be violent.
I, for one, am all for the non-violent solution. And I think it could stick, because it is in everyone's interest to leave in rather peaceful situation. When power is decentralized among people, and people do remember how this is important to
 - keep power divided
- don't be a dick or others will be dick to you
- help neighbours
then it should work.
Common this was working for millennial in many places. Only now too big gov starts dicking around EVERYWHERE and interfears with every aspect of life more then ever before (though they put up a smoke screen as the political over correctness to pretend you got more freedoms then ever... well right, except they instead take of all the power, law making, fair trial, war on terror, drugs dealing, money making, patents, and everything else that really matters)

NO. Taxes are not cooperation. Cooperation is voluntary.
For example, slaves at pharaon's times where not "cooperating to achieve great things", they were *forced* to live without freedom. 
And do not give us any of the democratic "but you voted" crap, I do not want to cooperate on invading iraq, torturing people, war on drugs, war on file sharers - or none of this bullshit.


Now this is a lie - unless you believe the money will be granted by Santa or something.
How childish are you to imply such a thing?
Who will give the money? I will, you will, our parents, children, friends.
We will all have to upkeep the people who are lazy and want to live "free live"...
when we have to slave away (work, and then give up large amount of income in tax or hidden tax like inflation) to sponsor the basic income bullshit - then we are to some degree slaves.
When we are free from such socialistic ideas, that is freedom.
How to know the difference?
The freedom is FROM something.
If you are forced to DO SOMETHING (e.g. work more) to give me "freedom", then I am exploiting you and to some degree you are my slave (at least in sense of money and work - but this translates to food, health, life, so yeah).

Only idiots think people supporting freedom or other libertarians/anarchists always want no ORGANIZATION and chaos.
What we usually actually want, is to just select own (local, voluntary) government, instead heaving one selected and push down our throats by what will happen to be current temporary majority of easily scared and manipulated mass mob of average idiots who vote to invade iraq because 9/11 job, give up all freedoms because turrorists and childruun and make it almost impossible to run bitcoin exchange because both.
Which left us with tax mostly funding war on other countries, on own people (abuse of recreational users, file sharers), own inventors (patents), own entrepreneurs (tax again) and on everyone (everyone is a criminal or felon).
So we want just a better gov, one that gives freedom, and yeah such local organizations would either help us get justice (arbitrage courts) - or would just avoid the entire issue (very few exchanges exist because AML/terrorists excuse) in the first place.

Yeap - this is the point. how you given them too much power? Your government took your money and spend to much on the military sector (and given them laws and such).
I am saying that you should be free to decide to either join such government, or create own new one that does things differently.
No matter what is your goal and what organization of YOUR community you want, you are allowed to do this.
Now when people realize this and start working on own communities where people live in general agreement about most important topics at least (or move / subscribe to something else if they can not find a consensus), then all people could be more happy the now.
Now, as you said, things will not change - because you need to convince millions of other people (or bribe a senator with millions $)...

Ok I have an idea: when you have coins on bitcoin account X, and you are sending them to account Y, to prove that this are actually your coins and not some stolen coins, you can sign the transaction with a digital signature. 
You would include there the lawful recipient, e.g. by writing his bitcoin public address Y. Then you would say the amount you allow him to get from your account lawfully.
Then you would send the above information about lawful transaction by using your public key X!

I am not, but some people are not realizing the reality.
Normally I could work on a field and produce 100 apples, exchange it on free market and get 100-apples-value of goods I need to live.
Instead, I have to give away over HALF of this, no one asked me for my consent this is just forced under excuse of doing things for my good, but in reality most of this is corrupted and wasted, I want to have freedom to again buy things for best prices on free market.
This is about tax (esp. on income) and about democracy;
Now specifically about basic income topic, this is the same, but now I will have to give up even more apples, so that people to choose to fuck around all day will have some.
So I have to make more then I would had to work in natural conditions.
If I choose to not work more, likely I will be arrested. 
So, free-market, freedom:
* I am free to use 100% of what I produce
* I am free to exchange it on free market, include buying things from investors to use economy of scale (that you needlessly linked, like if we woulnd't know such an obvious thing)
* The other guy is free to work, or to not work - his life choice
With basic-income:
* I am NOT free to use all the apples I produce
* I have to work more
* If I refuse to work more but try to keep my property then I am arrested (for not paying tax)
So coercion with force to make me work more.  Well, that is not typical slavery because I could refuse to work more, or work at all... but sure has similarities.

Since it requires this changes, then indeed users should first check against this conditions to decide if they should move coins or not.
(How ever carefully moving coins with planning and consideration anyway is never a bad idea).
Then the point remains about https sites dealing with bitcoins, they are most obviously hit and users should then be vigilant about using them until they re-issue new SSL certificates, as clearly stated by vuln analysis I linked. 
Also services with local bitcoind as wallet should make sure if they never enabled ssl, at very least.

Some vulnerabilities always leave a trace when they are exploited, e.g. vulns that only allow to DDoS.
Or vuln that allows to steal BTC from exchange should be quickly noticed or at least leaves a trace.
I suppose then it's possible to conclude that given bug was never used.
And here - this attack is silent... very bad.

on free-market you have good and bad actors and YOU select. More importantly, you might have other preferences of "good actors" then me, therefore in regulated big democracy we will never agree and will always have to fight each-other how to proceed.

* zero-coin, how ever this is not yet working, anoncoin will implement this ($ 369,054), DarkCoin promised it but is vaporware for now - should offer most perfect security of minable coins afaik

What he says is generally correct; 
Although I would not say there would be _0_ gans, just less gangs and SMALLER ones - so free people have standing chance to fight against them.
You can not fight your government today (in open battle) unless you want to be in prison / dead in hours - it would go like this:
* Gov: pay us the tax, we need to drop more bombs on houses in Afghan to liberate them!
* You: no fuck you murderers
* Gov: ok we're sending in the debt-collecting company
* You: fuck off "debt" collector, I have no debt to pay
* Gov: ok we will send him back with police
* You - defend your home
* Gov - breach in, and seize your daughter "come with us, your dad is a criminal, we will place you in an glorified orphanage house thing"
* You - leave my daughter - you take out gun
* Gov - police takes out guns and shoot
* You - kill the police...
then swat arrives
if you are still alive then fbi arrives
if you turned out to be a fucking Rambo, then army arrives
well this is not a game of GTA, you are dead now.
So yeap, you will support the war (or forever hide / be some hobo with no income) or you will die
I would rather fight the small gangs and build my own roads (just hire fucking construction workers along with 1000 neighbors, as gov does but not a dime will be spent on attacking some sand based goat shepherds).

I am against all taxes besides simple tax on land (could depend on land value, e.g. audctions system) and maybe per-head tax (would be best if the later would be voluntarily if possible - e.g. for given areas of country).

(you added this reply later - so separate post).
This is actually good world:
A) People who trusted Mark, took some risk (and lost it seems) - their freedom to take the risk.
B) People who said it's bad idea, didn't invest. They now do not have to bailout the "goxxed" people.
So A got what they wanted (the right to use mtgox), and B got what they wanted (right to not be a part of that debacle).
Can you actually propose a better solution? I think nothing better exists, there are just this options:
1) let both do what they want, A will use mtgox, B will not and will not bailout. This is the case now.
2) forbid users A from using mtgox. Would people really want this? Why some guy in Africa should.... vote? on which exchanges YOU are free to use?!
Would you accept it if Bitcoin Foundation would order everyone: stop using say btc-e, or we will arrest you?
That is a horrible solution for group A imo. 
And group B is unaffected.
3) allow use and force bailout. Seriously? Like the big banks bailout?
Do I need to explain what would people B think about paying their money to cover for A's bad decisions? And that B would make an Alt without such problems.

Yeah, come to work in my backyard and build me a swimming pool, then you can use it.. sometimes.. maybe - you will have the FREEDOM to use my swimming pool, the freedom from being swiming-pool derpived!
Is this a good idea or not, that I force you do to this (oh I let you first choose one out of 2 puppets to be a director that will set up how much money we will take from you to finance the swimming pool - in a vote each few years)?
Because that is all that socialism (and btw democracy) boils down to.
I propose that people should be free FROM heaving to participate in any such project even if lack of the project is dreadful (in your view!), while you say people should be forced to.
Which one is freedom do you think?
People who do not think it's a good idea to cooperate on X, will not use X. What is the problem?
Some people say army, perhaps police - could be exception (mini-monarchy), others that it should not be an exception (anarchy). I am in between, but would be best if it is more of a choice (perhaps have few kingdoms or states and each decide how to organize army). We can have local armies, but cooperate for common defences like NATO does.

Already replied - you are right this problem exists - AND this is a cause for which we can organize against.
We should fight such problem.
Is the big gov the best way to do this? Well, firs it created the problem - and now I read that private police and people just arming themselves on their own are good, and private paramilitary defense organizations (in Mexico)
In Poland myself I had often to do with police, e.g. when helping other people (petty crime, robbery and such) and they are horrible - if we would not pay tax for them we could organize better own protection. 
***Also state forbids us to defend themselve/ourselves, only the inept state-monopoly police, and the criminals have weapons, because they ignore anti-guns law while 'normal people' do not.***
You can fight the existing problem of actual crime in many ways and I believe more local, more decentralized police will also be better then huge bureaucratic super-police that you can not effectively get to do things you want.
Can you get them to stop chasing not crimes (mp3, ganja, patents, children playing war or drawing a gun on paper) and concentrate fully on actual crime?!
In democracy this apparently is very hard.

Yeap, we're going to write RBAC profiles for bitcoind, it says e.g. bitcoind has right to rw wallet.dat,  w debug.log, bind to given IPs and so on;
If for some reason it would try to access ~/.ssh/id_rsa then it wound be killed;
More importantly,  if your firefox, pidgin, libreoffice, kmail or ANY other program would try to suddenly read wallet.dat, it would be killed and incident will be logged in syslog.
If you like this ideas, why not join us at irc  ( irc.oftc.net they are tor friendly , but also freenode and i2pirc). Mostly to IDLE for now (low activity) and read announcements.

Why we have to agree on same level of freedom?
Well we should have globally the full freedom, and locally - what YOU want.
I agree, if you want middle size gov then you should have the right to do it.
Just let me please have my own tiny gov over at my city, is that ok?!
And globally it should be the full freedom for the simple reason that...
* full freedom does allows people to locally have less freedom if they decide so (to create local laws)
* limited global freedom will not allow local pockets of more freedom (or they will allow temporary but can take it at a whim)
What do you want, middle size gov? Please do it, just please leave room for people who will want to escape your system because they have other needs/views and let them form other things outside.

They will stop when it becomes not profitable.
When they resolve to extortion, kidnap or plain old robbery, this is a cause against which all normal citizens - a VAST majority of people will stand against.
This is what we (most of anarchists, liberty, freedom people etc) want to organize against.
We will create own "government" that will appoint security force, detectives to conduct such actual war on crime.
When crime is really doing obviously bad things to other people with force.
* Not when "crime" is sharing mp3 with friend.
* Not when the money "to fight crime" goes into FUNDING murder on children in iraq and lybia and other places.
***This is the difference between slavery of democracy, and a free system of mostly against-violence people.***
Edit: "50 years before prohibition" there were times when gov money to fight crime gone into real crime, not this all new bullshit thought-cimes and not-crimes right? Then it was better, either way it's getting worse and worse - and USA lost all their freedoms.
Then perhaps it was closer to freedom in the past, but as government grow stronger and people grow weeker, the big gov gained it's power to create imaginary and harmful wars instead doing what people really want.
Liberty, anarchy is about reversing this process.

If only things that harm other people would be illegal, there would be no problems like with war on drugs, on ethanol, on file sharers, and you would get cheap medication and general happiness.
Harm means attacking other people, excluding expressing own opinion (no censorship), including things like polluting environment (unless it's your own env, e.g. you own 10x10 km of land in the desert, or cut trees you planted in own backyard etc).
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:46:21
why any cooperation would need to be forced actually? Did you ever took a moment and thought about it?
Now write your reply.
Then take your reply, and think - if this is really that important that I am SURE this needs to be done, would all other people not do it... why not?
 * yes, they will (build roads and shit) - so no problem, people will still do it
 * yes, they will do things that scale like organize a hospital (a private one, or with health insurance, VOLUNTARY INSURANCE!) - but if someone wants to opt-out and instead buy own MRI machine then why not
 * well no, some people will not want schools, they prefer to teach kids other things and teach it themselves - ok, just let them do that
So, things that we need, will happen, and some things that YOU want but OTHER PEOPLE do not want, you should fuck off from them and let them be free, maybe they really do want different things.
* On things you agree - cooperate freely.
* On things that you disagree - go each own way.
This is freedom. Also known e.g. as .
And is opposite to the slavery of socialism under false excuses that majority or the state has the right to decide for people what is best for them.
Please read this few times until this is clear if you do not get it at first time, because this is really *all that is to it*.
Then please consider supporting freedom instead being evil person who wants to do things that I do not want while claiming it's for "my protection" or my good.

In a normal, free country you as a ***child*** would be still forced to, by your parents.
But the country would not force you to say learn that evolution did happened nor that evolution did not happened - educational program should be decided by your parents, and as a smart kid or young adult you will anyway seek to learn what you will find interesting.
You should be free to say skip classes on biology and focus on become brilliant mathematician.


Many public causes are founded without global tax.
Tax could be local - decided in given city (and that is more fair often).
Tax could be more like shopping, you should more directly decide what to build and what not to build (obviously finding funds for roads etc will be easiest as everyone profits).


We also use same IPv4, IPv6 structure - while this is not a law all the companies, back bones and ISPs can regulate (and do, on firewalls).
Obviously roads (both minimal-state owned and city owned and private) would come to such an obvious agreement that benefits everyone.


Well forcing people who can not defend themselves or can not really decide, due to age (or e.g. mental condition) is a widely recognized crime; 
Though, if we would be speaking of 3-rd world, then child workers are a good thing, because the alternative is that this children would die from lack of food or medication.
Btw it is regulation (patents) that forbids people from selling dirt-cheap medication to them.


No, freedom of religion is LACK of a regulation.
Freedoms are "from something".
I am free from being abused for heaving Christianity or Satanism or FSM-ism etc (good).
I am free from being abused for heaving sex [with other adults] that others do not approve of (e.g. same gender) in my home at least (good).
I am free from being abused if I call the guys above superstitious / faggots respectivly (good).
I am free from being abused if I decline to enter business contract (e.g. hiring) abovementioned faggots.
I am free from being abused if I then refuse services to a company that I know is "homofobic".
I am free to ***defend myself*** if someone attacks me just because "I am black" or because "I am gay" - and such attack will be the illegal thing, physical attacks are clearly recognized as crime;
Btw defending from attack if I was attacked first is though allowed (but yet to reasonable degree: if someone throws an tomato at someone for no reason, and the vitcim retaliates by cutting attackers both hands and then slitting his throat it's obviously taken way too far) and so on.
This above would be a minimal form of regulation, one possible type of "mini-country" or mini-gov systems.
The outcome would be also that you can use what ever ***values*** like ***crypto-currencies*** you want,
as you want,
you do not have to report it to anyone (I would prefer to have no income/profit tax, if there must be some tax for MINIMAL country then it should be on land or other obvious things like that - easy to get, no greay area, no corruption, fair and simple).
Though still you are free to **refuse working*** with companies that do BTC, use only some forked regulated-Coin (colored coin?) 
and deny accepting/spending with business partners (e.g. shops) that still do "use that diabolic bitcoins" or call them all **stealing jews** if that is your opinion ;)
You do what you want, I do what I want and everyone is happy.
Regulation will make one of us unhappy, why should we?

No, this is the 100% legal way to do things:
Do business with company in same country (e.g. PL) and pay 43% tax (or 86% tax in case of obtaining payment in bitcoin - it seems),
or do business with party outside of EU and pay 20% tax.
This are the options created by our greedy and silly government (which btw is obviously killing any innovation in this area).

Then you get two courts to cooperate. Same as guy in Russia can talk on reddit or trade bitcoins with guy in USA without need for government... or actually, DESPITE the government's attempts to meddle in.
Arbitrage exists. 
International laws exist for cross-country deputes, we should be free to create own sovereign entities e.g. once where bitcoin is fully legalized, other that does not have tax on income (I would move there), maybe one where people do have communism/socialism if that is what they want.

How The FBI Invaded Martin Luther King Jr.'s Privacy -- And Tried To Blackmail Him Into Suicide
Every year, the memory of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. evokes a nationwide sense of self reflection. The legendary Civil Rights leader forced the country to take a cold, hard look in the mirror and face the bitter treatment and hypocritical denial of basic liberties to African-Americans. But years after his death, not only do the icon's words still ring true, but the government's extreme plot to bring him down proves how far the country still has to go with respect to civilian privacy.
Just a few days after President Obama laid out a plan for modest changes to the National Security Agency, and months after the public clamor provoked by the leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, this Martin Luther King Day shines a light on a stain on the government's history when it went through great lengths to destroy a man it now celebrates.
FBI records give a detailed account of the organization's efforts to derail King's civil rights work. After delivering his "I Have A Dream Speech," at the 1963 March on Washington, the government's interest of the leader intensified. One FBI memo refers to King as "the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country."
In an effort to prove he was under Communist influence, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover spent significant resources monitoring King's movements and eavesdropping on his communications. Attorney General Robert Kennedy gave consent, allowing the organization to break into King's office and home installing phone taps and bugs to track the leader's movements and conversations as well as those of his associates. Although the recordings did not reveal any association with the Communist Party, they did reveal extensive details about his extramarital affairs.
After learning King would be the recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, Hoover took his fanatical obsession with obliterating King to the next level. Agents sent the reverend an anonymous note, chastising him for his affairs and implying that he should commit suicide.
Excerpts from the letter reveal just how far the government would go to tear the leader down:
    King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and a great liability to all of us Negroes. White people in this country have enough frauds of their own but I am sure they don't have one at this time anywhere near your equal. You are no clergyman and you know it. I repeat you are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that. You could not believe in God... Clearly you don't believe in any personal moral principles.
    King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do it (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significance). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation.
Hoover despised King with an incredible zest and put the bureau's full power behind eliminating the leader.
In her new book "The Burglary: the Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI," journalist and author Betty Medsger chronicles Hoover's obsession with King and overzealous violation of the leader's privacy:
"Hoover's attitude toward King can be described as a nearly savage hatred... The plot involved office break-ins, use of informers, mail opening, wiretapping, and bugging of King's office, home, and hotel rooms."
But Dr. King's story isn't one that only lives in history books, reflecting a time long past. Snowden's leak of NSA secrets revealed how much government surveillance has grown dramatically in the decade since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
While Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy reflects the memory of an utterly selfless man who prioritized peace and justice over hate and inequality, it simultaneously reveals how far a government is willing to go when it suspects that someone is a threat to the status quo, and effectively an enemy of the state.

In Warsaw (capital) a hospital run by Medicover (a private health care company) is working to deploy option to pay in Bitcoin.
The payment will be first available for non-citizens, so tourists, non-residents etc. (1) 
This Hospital will be first in the World to accept Bitcoins.
It was founded in 2010 year and plans to start the bitcoin payment in upcoming year 2015.
Dariusz Malczyk one of the directors, says the rising number of visiting external (non-Polish) patients was the reason for this move, as over 5000 of non-resident people use their services yearly.
(1) my comment: maybe because of tax law in Poland that still makes bitcoin payment a bit of gray area for Polish companies when servicing Polish or European-Union zone customers: it was suggested even to take double VAT, so 46% tax in case o BTC pament, in addition to normal here 20% income tax.
But I'm not up to date on this situation and it might be getting better, even here is our deeply socialist and anti-enterprise country.
Either way, hurray for bitcoin medical payments :)

25 btc is not a cost (not even for network), it is the "inflation" or rather just a supply. Because so far demand rises faster, we have a deflation - which is very good imo, and which makes bitcoin overall a good investment tool (for the patient people) for for the years to come.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:02:01
To highlight things relevant mostly to bitcoin cause:
* against government regulation
* against income tax
* against capital gains tax
* (instead land tax, per-head tax)
* for free-market
* for legalizing all drugs trade
In their book "taxes - a thing about the robbery" they point out inflation of state-fiat as important way to rob citizens of their savings.
*EDITED:* *BONUS*: about EU Parliament usefulness, the party leaders say that best use of the EU Parliament building would be to turn it for example to a borthel :D
Btw. KNP has some traditional values about family, but do not let the media and journalists fool you, leader's private opinion that normal family is man+female, or that females are usually more beautiful and the more fragile gender - have no bearing on their real task: to *reduce EU bureaucracy and reduce taxes*.

And btw that is not a democracy. Democracy means you and I must follow identical rules created by assholes that are picked by either of us (enslaving the another).
Freedom means you follow gov/rules A, while I follow B.
Freedom without violence usually means that while doing this I do not attack you and you don't attack me, and if I would attack you then hopefully C,D,E,F.... cities/villages/mini-countries would come to a rescue and insist strongly on keeping right to sovereignty of our borders.

Any data sent to https could have been read by crackers. 
I'm not 100% sure how that wallet works.
1) if it just works like other sites and the private data you send them == access to money, then the money should be considered compromised
2) if they have no ownership, e.g. privkey is generated/encrypted fully LOCALLY on your computer with javascript or something - then it would be safe... how ever
2b) ... this bug is so bad that attacker could possibly spoof the blockchain https response and inject there javascript troyan to steal the local secret. This sounds like a complex scenario, requiring someone to exploit this problem and intercept (MITM) the connection. How ever imo, where millions are involved imo all is possible.

Just using linux does not grant full security (but makes it much easier to obtain and gives reasonable starting position).
Best general tool to increase general security of system in Linux seems to be  because they fix even unknown yet bugs and pioneer all the ideas that are years later copied to other systems like to regular Linux and to Windows and MacOS (e.g. read xor write memory NX bit, adress space randomization etc - come from them). And they continue to be years ahead of other players (though OpenBSD is interesting too).
I help on project (  ) where we for now succeeded in pre-packaging a nice .deb to get users going easily on such hardened-kernel version of Debian. 
Hopefully such secured system would be basis for well protected desktops for use with bitcoin, and (in sever edition) for bitcoin related servers / web servers.

Countless exploits. In kernel, in Android API, and on the mobile phone hardware (like the samsung backdoor in phone bios).
A regular PC with a linux, or best hardened grsecurity kernel (try the mempo kernel - it's a stable linux where you add the secure kernel 
See reddit discusion of mempo 
btw. do not worry about the "beta testing" too much - grsecurity exists since over 12 years,
and mempo for a year (getting popular in last months). For bitcoin you might want to build the kernel yourself using mempo's script, or wait until we have multiply signatures before storing too much there, but it will be one of best tech for it.
Or just build grsecurity yourself, or use hardened gentoo.
Or OpenBSD.

You are totally mistaken. 
Enabled javascript is what FBI used to successfully hack all/most freedom host users. 
Enabled javascript is also what allows to almost perfectly fingerprint your browser via various unique metrics.
Enabled javascript is in addition the thing that makes it impossible on 99% of systems to turn on strong anti exploit protection on firefox, in grsecurity (I develop mempo the hardened debian).
Fuck javascript (in web browser), it has no use near security. You would need a perfectly sandboxes run in virtual machine (with slowed down clock and all) to try to limit it's effect in exploits and fingerprints and TBB does not do that.
If you do not know this things why take part in a discussion?
"The Tor developers aren't some band of goofy idiots. Their design decisions are highly thought through and subject to rigorous and ongoing research."

Why it is superior? Tribal kings did not spy on each citizen as much as NSA does nor murdered so many people, I guess it depends on technology and scale - but, you can kill a tribe leader.
Insider can murder king, and defeating small tribe is manageable.
When one day USA comes to "free" your country in some way (maybe to bring democracy to your artists and save them via ACTA+SOPA)... will you be able to withstand them?
If your local bribed government will attack you can you realistically defend? Will you shoot cop, then more cops, then special forces and army when it comes to this? I mean you could, in some suicidal "you won't take me alive" thing...

Good to know this, so as it's recommended - first do not panic and don't start moving all money "right now1".
How ever I think it's good idea to move accounts that hold significant amounts just to be sure. Are you absolutely sure you didn't had another vuln on local user side (e.g. another system user, or perhaps ssh tunneling or something) that could exit to your localhost?
Opening RPC to LAN, and possible exploited computer in LAN is another scenario that can happen when there are thousands and millions to gain.
And obviously all professional entities, pools, shops, exchanges should migrate as well.

The 200,000 - 700,000 BTC that are apparently belonging to mtgox, are still left unspent in few huge chunks going back to year 2011, and are connected to the 424242.. transaction (as user xelister suggested on irc) that was provably owned by mtgox as evidneced by Mark.
In such case, this is obviously not true that this is malability problem as main problem.

I think it is unknown yet if someone did exploited this problem before, a skilled attacker would leave no trace and just passively decode all current and past communication of all servers (especially a resourceful attacker like NSA, or hacker aiming to make millions).
"A zero-day (or zero-hour or day zero) attack or threat is an attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application, one that developers have not had time to address and patch.[1] There are zero days between the time the vulnerability is discovered (and made public), and the first attack."

Nothing, all that is done good is done by people.
People pay money - government robs it, takes part for corruption, part to fund wars. 
If we would remove the government and instead have more bottom-up organizations, then such organizations would not waste money on this and would not fund war (also war on drugs and other bullshit). They would spend the funds in a really good way like a company - because if not - they would get fired by you the paying customer.
No change.org silly petitions, no fucking around, just voting with wallet and your local "gov" or firefighters or road builders are out, and new ones are in - that you choose directly, locally and with right to have other provider then everyone else (if you have the money for it then why not).
Democracy based on global forced opinion of majority does the exact opposite, and that is why this sucks and we're left in today's shitty world with NSA, SOPA+ACTA (ringing door bell again and again, other laws already in place), creating war - murdering thousands and destroying lives of millions in Afghan, Iraq, Libia because banksters/oil/gold/petrodolar interest ... all funded by taking YOUR money.

You can not achieve freedom while heaving a government of this type as now we have (majority elected, not afraid to use force/violence to enforce huge set of arbitrary rules not just for for enforcing most basic universally understood laws like don't murder don't steal physical property etc).
I do not say you must have full anarchy understood as total chaos though.
We can have freedom instead, if you want government then you organize one or subscribe/move to existing one, BUT you are free to also not do that, move to other place and live there by other set of rules (and invite there more people).

I think multi sign would make it possible to try to resist extortion - at least more then with regular cash or goods. That is quite cool.
This also helps in cases of money being stolen.
One more use case is when money is lost (lacking new backup of wallet).
I think time-lock transactions could be implemented. Not sure if there is BIP for it yet.
"If 1000 blocks from now, this address still has 10 BTC spendable, then send them THEN to address X".
Where as X you would pass address of a friend or cold storage or throughly backed up wallet.

Taxes build roads, they also send people "overseas" to murder, rape and invade.
If citizens themselves keep the money and spend it on free market, they would rather buy more roads, and less happily instead waste this money to sponsor invasions, mass invigilator programs and other achievements" of big government.

Yeap this is why democracy does not work - the masses of scared idiots (ban bitcoin and tor - because the terrrorisstss omg) appoint the dictators, and they are even worse: 
"do not rebel against us - YOU CHOSEN US you all*¹* agreed, so you all*¹* agreed with our decisions*²* which are obviously the best possible*³* then since that is the will of majority*¹* *²*"
Look at this fallacies:
*¹* if candidate X wins, this does not mean that we all agreed, at most it means over 50% of us agreed, [typical western] democracy guarantees always that over half, not all.
*²* did everyone who picked say Obama wanted Guantanamo bay concentration camp, dronnin' random people, and other war crimes to continue? And the NSA spying? Probably not everyone. That's a lie unless we talk about direct democracy with referendum.
*³* it is not true that will of majority is best or most fair for given group. Take example, country in Africa where majority is for-circumcision of girls (cutting out parts of their vagina outer regions), or for attacking/punishing/killing gay people. Does this mean this is the correct thing to FORCE DOWN on everyone?
¹ and ² are resolved by changing democracy to more direct form, at least to direct democracy
³ is resolved by changing democracy to a free system where people are allowed to create own more local laws or moved away if they do not fit with current majority. This is not the case for typical democracy:
* If you do not agree with war on drugs, you can move to other state - but this fixes just the war on marijuana. 
* what if you want freedom to have guns (in country that bans guns globally)?
* what if you want freedom to live without guns in your neighborhood (in country that allows guns globally)?
Well this are unsolvable problems, if they are national-wide decisions. But solution is so simple: just make the laws more local, then if something really bothers you, you can move to other city to fit in.
Or just change the opinion of local citizens - you have real effect on small community.
Not so much for global one (did many of us here run for the president or senator? how much of us are senators?).
For really important decommissions democracy does not work, you can write all your silly little change.org petitions (which are good a bit, that they remind people of the problem at least),
but the big politicians protect their own interest and will not change grand plans because of you in most cases. Even without politicians, good luck convincing millions of other people about your local cause.
We need freedom to have different opinion then "the majority" and do things own way. We need to learn to not attack each-other to force own views with violence and let other people be.
This ideals are for example called Agorism ( ) 
 * and usually fit nice with concepts like Bitcoin - freedom to do own finances how YOU wish not how majority wishes (no majority vote on bailing out mtgox or other shit).
 * or like Darknet e.g. Freenet i2p or tor dark sides - topic of censorship - where you can do what ever you want locally but no one will take down site of other group even if they do not agree

Ok, if they would have right to print out money out of thin air... oh wait, no that's bad example...

That is the last resort. How about we take all YOUR money, or arrest your girlfriend for walking without covering her face, or some other ideology that someone sees fit? Problem - you can move away :P
Forcing people to move out of a district, e.g. making guns-allowed or weed-allowed, or red-district, is very ok.
Forcing them out of city is ok.
But forcing to leave behind entire country, own culture, own race, family etc, is quite shitty.
This is one of the reasons why democracy works the worse the bigger it is (the other reason is that in big democracy your voice is meaningless, and another one is that in big group people want too many different things so there is no pleasing of everyone even remotely - as we see here about the social problem btw :).

They banned sell of light-bulbs (over 60 Watt power). Yes now 80 Watt light-bulb is illegal good in EU, wonder why it is not on SilkRoad ;)  (of course, this stupid law can be worked around by calling the home lightbulbs "electrical heaters" for one example).

It's a good idea usually to look at merit instead of style, in discussion :)
Deflation currency should stop a totalitarian-like government from too easily printing money and silently taxing money to sponsor things that gov wants but people would not want to sponsor - especially the war. Both external wars, and internal wars like on drugs, on file-sharing, on free speech, and previously on the drug ethanol.
Bitcoin has one more way to counter problems caused government: it could free people from paying taxes I guess (though I will not say that I advice it). But that is irrelevant to being deflationary, just mentioning this aspect.
Maybe saying "things we do not need" was not precise.
I mean things that you buy because you are marketed into it, and you buy just because "oh I can always max out my credit card or get more cards and debts". 
And when you think about it month later your realize it was a bad decision.
In world of deflation people will very quickly learn to think about this:
- "I can buy twice more next month" - this requires some self-discipline
- No one borrows BTC in BTC, because everyone knows it would be likely a suicide
- "I earn money just from money sitting in my pocket". Kind of like a villager-farmer would really think twice before eating his last chickens.

For example Hitler was a well known socialist, elected by democracy:
The National Socialist Programme (aka the 25-point Programme and the 25-point Plan) was the party program of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP).... [1]
But this is just one example.
In ***general terms***, fascism is totalitarian by definition [2] of course.
But Socialism very often heads towards fascism as logical consequence of the will to steal from working people to give to "poor" people - how you can do this without knowing how much everyone earns? This requires advanced spying apparatus.
Even faster in Communism.
Also, the idea to steal someone's money, or all his money and possessions (Communism) - is totalitarian and immoral ***in itself***.
Systems that could avoid above fate are freedom based systems, where sharing is result of free market and ***social help*** is ***voluntary***.
It's important to have freedom to escape socialism, to opt-out from the "help" of socialists - such freedom is a goal in itself.
When we speak about socialists or communists, in all existing implementations it means that you will not allow anyone to escape your beloved "help", because if you let them escape then you are doing free-cities / free market / agorism etc.
[1] 
Originally the name of the party was the German Workers' Party (DAP) but on the same day of the announced party program it was renamed the NSDAP, Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, headed by Adolf Hitler.
[2] 
Fascism (/fæʃɪzəm/) is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism[1][2] that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. Influenced by national syndicalism, fascism originated in Italy during World War I, combining more typically right-wing positions with elements of left-wing politics,[3] in opposition to liberalism, Marxism, and traditional conservatism.

But they have debt in USD, not in BTC.
If e.g. suddenly 80% of people (count) and business (transactions volume) would move to BTC, the USD debts would become easier to pay once BTC eventually go up.
Currently we are at downfall but in long run it must reverse (unless BTC completely stops being used, because it is deflation by definition).

We have churches and charity groups for taking care of basic  needs people around you. You know what, if an actually dying of lack of food person would by dying "on my foodstep" I would surly help (assuming he's not a notorious drunk/junky), without need to steal your money for that.
If you want to decide to take everyone's e.g. 50% of income (as it is in Poland) then can you do it like in own charity group or even entire city, but as opt-in, without forcing everyone everywhere to do the same?

Taxation is bad, because you can not opt out. 
You can not say "police force keeps killing innocent citizens, they suck, I will not pay for them - and I do not need their protection".
You can not even leave your city. You would have to leave entire country, and even then most countries in the world do not have freedom.
But some do.
The fact that you can say who will be the next person forcing this on you (e.g. which on the two war criminals, in states) is not making this much better really.
There are some free countries, and I hope more will merge :) and USA used to be much more free afair, did not had the **income tax**.
If you do not have tax, you can just buy things that you need. 
Do you have a food tax, so you will pay 10% more of income and then the Commison of Food will decide what each person should eat and will send you your food without asking you much about it?
I would prefer to instead keep the money and buy my own food myself, thank you very f much government.
p.s. if you are tempted to ask top  or  questions "but who will build the roads" or "but who will keep people from killing eachother" please google a bit first, was asked million times :) I recommend the above subs for more on this.
Such a free society is separate question then the one about inflation/deflation, though in a free society the choice will be up to people do they want to use state-fiat or BTC or gold (this choices are being restricted in USA, and could get worse in future)

First of, this is about deflationary economy for entire country (and we do not know yet if Bitcoin will make that in fact happen, but we will see :).
So for deflationary country I think it will reduce chance of people buying silly things, like "margeritavilles". Eventually when people have all the things they need, they will also buy other things, e.g.: consider your money grows 100% each year. 
Will you put off selling of a new gaming console for a week and get 2 USD?
Or for a year and get 100 USD (more of buying power)?
Maybe you prefer to newer buy it, but instead in 10 years go on holiday to tropical island.
Or wait 100 years and... but that is a bit long.
In the end I assume it can reduce irrational wasting money (even money "for fun" can be wasted) and lead to more reasonable decisions both for fun and for survival.
Hopefully it could also reduce:
- waste of natural resources (mining all the coal/rare earths/minerals and building stupid things out of them instead waiting 3 years and doing it with much more economical technology) - which btw can benefit your local ecology actually
- financing wars or other huge efforts that people would normally not like (why waste all the money on attacking Arabs again, maybe instead just chill, wait a year and have money for all the cool things we want to have in our country)

Of course I want healthcare, but not a shitty state issued one! I want freedom to choose my healthcare provider, and to pay for him myself. 
EDIT: for example in bitcoins :3 (which my stupid states does not allow, or taxes 66% tax vat+vat+income)
For example in Poland we have just 1 real provider, state """```free```"" health care NFZ (that hires all the doctors via various sub contractors) that you pay 50% of income and you can not opt-out from this. Waiting queue to see a specialist in health-endangering queue often reaches months, or even 1 year, waiting queue to get some """free""" needed operation, e.g. hip joint prosthetic replacement can be 1 to 5 years or more.
Other people also should be free to pay each for his own, or organize into some bigger groups as they want - just do not drag everyone into their group.

If Christians would stay true to their teaching, they would not kill nor enslave Negros etc, this is very clear.
When Socialists stay clear to their teaching, they ***will*** steal your money using tax, by definition, and take away your freedom to choose providers of "free" services (see post above). 
This almost ***requires*** spying apparatus (unless you would tax not on income/profit, but on e.g. land bought from state - then that would be better).
So Socialist by definition try to apply anti-freedom system, at least with elements of spying on all citizens.

I would say Most people (of general population) are idiots, not just 40%. Of course that depends how exactly you define at which point someone is "an idiot".
But here is a more concrete fact: intelligence, wisdom, usually is around Gauss curve. So it is the rule of mediocre. Though this is quite offtopic.
About tax: this is exactly how taxation on income (or on sales) works: you are punished, under thread of violence to give your money to someone else, or else they will take away your things, money and even children (if you would be jailed).
And then **they tell you what you can and can not buy** with money that you earned - which is what you are against (previous post).

Since now (end of 2015-01) they license this code as *Microsoft* (lol?!) software licence - you can NOT modify the code for commercial or noncommercial use.
They pushed backdated commit to git to make it appear they changed the license few months ago, with no explanation given why they would do it, so only thing that comes to mind is possible setup to maliciously sue users who used the produce as licensed.

nope, it's only unfulfilled promises. See my other post. 
To get a real pure open-hardware, without hardware backdoors, check out openrisc for example.
In real tech like OpenRISC you:
* get the source code of hardware (can review it) 
* then generate the program for FPGA 
* load it into FPGA yourself
* or, create the ASIC project and get it fabbed (if you have large funds)
* or at least buy mass produced ASIC (with option to verify the silicon if you really must - see youtube vids on decapping and analyzing hardware, e.g. TPE modules)

This "computer" called CHIP - is shit for security. 
It is ***NOT*** an **open hardware**!
They are lying: project's home page is saying nice things that we want to hear, like 
they **say** "it's all about open source"... but wait, OK... WHERE IS THE SOURCE?!
Can anyone find it? Since months people demanded it and nothing.
Also I read that company behind it is well known for heaving bad open source relations, even with simple things like linux drivers for their devices... and open-hardware is few steps more hard (open-sources &lt; open firmware &lt; open detailed specs of cpu and synthesized programs to load into own FPGA &lt; full source code of the hardware from which the fpga/silicon cpu is generated)! and they are not even at step one, there is no source for any of this CHIP!
So please, do not fall for bait and switch.
Better look at real pure open-hardware, like OpenRISC
real open-hardware projects have the source code of the electronics of the hardware (that you can program into FPGA, or burn ASIC if you have access to fab)
For example this is open hardware:
 - download the hardware soure code
There is no such things for this Next Thing Co's "CHIP".

urandom generates entropy based on past entropy
random waits to gather new true entropy, from actual physical/random events that happen in your computer
Currently it urandom generating entropy only based-on true entropy seems quite secure anyway.
But one day it could turn out that some computers (maybe QC) or some new math breakthrough could allow to attack stronger things generated based on the derived entropy of urandom.  While true entropy of random remains superior (but slower).

Heh :) "Rafal Freeman for the president!" I expect 60% in 1st round ;)
I will promote freedom - strong reduction of taxation and regulation, just like that guy Ron Paul that did same things and TOTALLY won each time in democratic vote right? Oh... oh.
In big democracy you always have 2 choices, and both sucks.
Nowdays it is between 
* fascist socialistic nanny-state, 
* or fascist socialistic nanny-state that is more pussy and more black (USA).
Or in Poland - I can choose between between: 
* 30% fascist socialistic nanny-state that is pro-church and pro-tradition,
* 60% fascist socialistic nanny-state that is pro-ateists and pro-homos. How cool.
* yeah and the libertarian guys have ~7% ... trying to win for **30 years** now.
In democratic vote between 10 people that could work sure, as I written above, but not in a country.
Democracy can NEVER give people freedom even by DEFINITION. Ban or allow weed? Ban or allow guns?
Reasonable people know to allow both, but the idiots also have the right to e.g. live in place where only criminals have guns and the law-obeying citizens are defenseless, or in place where you will be thrown to jail for weed - because they wrongly think that will make their city safer or whatever.
This is not the case, BUT they have the right to be wrong - this is freedom, you should be free to complicate your own life if you want and other people consent.
So what to do? We have 4 choices. All are valid. 
Democracy will at satisfy 25% of people (assuming both problems would be more or less divided in half on people's preferences).
Agorism of free city states or other system with LOCALIZED LAW, will allow to create 4 cities or districts or zones or states, and if people find it important enough they can move and that way get 100% people content on this topics. The smaller the law the better it works. 
Actually yeah, once we have the city-states or miny-monarchy or thousand-Liechtensteins, then if some of the cities want to have a democracy then sure. Then your tool will be useful for them too. Let's just not forget though that large scale democracy is never a good thing.
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:33:26
That is a faulty assumption. 
Lichtenstein is a monarchy (not pure, sure, but with quite strong power in hands of king/duke) and that problem does not exist there.
Many democracies are more criminal about opposition, e.g. USA, Poland, Germany, UK where you can go to jail for voicing concerns or dislike or joking about the President (PL) about ruling Banksters/Jews (UK,DE,most of EU), about mass immigration of Negros and people from cultures very different to European culture (most of EU and USA).
In addition to examples, there is nothing in monarchy that would forbid a kind and tolerant king. What if Snowden or Assange would be the king, are you sure they would be throwing any opposition into prison or spy on them?
I know I would not. Would you?

In fact luke-jr ***here*** is right. Democracy, rule of mob of idiots, is bad for getting to the truth.
But see Luke, with monarchy or other authoritative system, you can get a good king, or bad one, or a crazy king.
If you think more people then 100, or probably then 10 use Tonal then you're probably not in good contact with the reality. 
And if you think people will switch to tonal... no, nope, everyone is used entire life to thinking in 10-base, from geeks through normal citizens of 1 and 2 world countries, up to tribesman in undiscovered forests (mostly).
So this is not happening, therefore your Tonal is a your wish that is not the reality. Putting it on a page like if it's the description of current situation, is batshit crazy man.

For bitcoin it should be the same, though the subset of bitcoin-related developers who write directly blocks/script might use hex numbers sometimes for bitcoin.
Basically no one uses tonal for bitcoin, except Luke, his kids/friends maaybe and that dead guy who invented it century+ ago.
So it's crazy to present the unused representation as a totally normal and usual way to do things in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-01 07:14:08

For example a monarchy can be good or bad or crazy (like with Tonal and "spam" patches ;).

@_date: 2015-03-01 18:21:29
There are many variants how this could be.
Personally I could settle for something more or less how people have now, but with moving all law making to city-level, and allowing people who own e.g. 5km² of land to declare independent city there.
In such case each city hires people to protect their borders as they wish. Small cities, medium cities, big cities and conglomerations, everyone has a chance to find what he likes.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:09:53
Yeap, democracy by representative can be even worse (and has other outcome) then direct democracy.
But both can not solve the 49-51 problem, only solution can happen if both groups are allowed to go own way, when the gun law is not legalized not delegalized, it is not done at all at country level. Instead both cities decide.
Yeap, then the cities can - as you said - use voting systems like DemocracyOS or anything (e.g. opentransactions) to vote.
The point is that we should be vigilant against [state wide] democracy (direct or not).
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:11:49


Greece free city-states.
Lichtenstein, Hong-Kong, Singapour do you like them? Because crypto-anarchy of course will (at least in large part) organize into such structures, but more people could easily live in such a happy place.


Of course any system has problems. 
But democracy is shit for freedom even if it works, there is NO solution to 49-51, do not quote me wikipedia :) just tell me how do you think you will solve this problem?
* 49% people want to ban guns, 51% want to allow easy access to them
* 49% people want to ban file sharing, 51% want to ignore imaginary property and patents
* 49% people want to ban weed, 51% want to allow easy access to it
(Let's assume there is no strong correlation on this topics, creating about 1/8 = 12.5% groups for each of the 2^3=8 possible options).
What do you do in practice, how would your country handle it?
Democracy will make ~88% unhappy by choosing 1 of 8 options e.g. YNN, and all other people are forced into it.
A king will also make 88% unhappy in a similar way.
But both (or any other form) could decide to make a partial anarchy, or mini-states, that is allow each city to have own rules. Also anarcho-capitalism naturally allows this to each city too. That way close to ~0% people are happy on this subjects.

Democracy as a national government system is biggest crap today, that suffocates all freedoms.
Users of **crypto-anarchy** systems should know why, but let me just point this evidence: NO DEMOCRACY succeeded in making citizens free, even in basic things:
1. right to medicate (take herbs, mushrooms, etc) yourself - this is your body so your decision
2. right to process information: say things without censorship, share computer files that you have on own computer - copyslavery "copyrights" and inventionslavery "patents"
Not even one democracy has even this 2 simple freedoms.
Although, maybe your tool is interesting tool for people who will anyway be stuck in democracy, or who wish to use voting where it makes sense e.g. in voluntary organizations/entities/companies/etc.
@_date: 2015-03-01 07:23:48


I would rather have a random person ruling me then a democracy. If I get lucky maybe he would be smart and good (e.g. just, supporting freedom - personal and economical). 
Democracy is always at most mediocre and stupid, usually social-democracy or other anti-freedom bullcrap.
And the leaders are result of a natural selection of biggest most evil asshole, or war criminals (like in USA).
But then again, it would be best to have 1000 small countries with kings/dukes, and if people could move quite freely between. In some time the ones would be immigrated into and worst ones would die out.

The same as always. You take a guy, give him gun / electric gun / handcuffs / car with proper marking, uniform, and he will be the guard.
Except, this time around, once the cop starts doing things that given local community does not want, e.g. working in pro-guns, pro-weed, against-porn city he starts arresting or making problems for weed users, he gets kicked the fuck out of the job.
If that continues, entire service provider is kicked out and new one bought/created by the local citizens.
Thing like rogue cop that beats someone, kills his dog for no reasons, murder a guy for playing poker etc, will never happen.
Unless you know, in a city where there is death penalty for playing poker, but I would never join a city with laws that allow descent into such fascist police state.
And in USA, EU, Canada, etc - you have exactly this, and no way out.

Free cities with local laws that small, probably quite homogenous (sharing same goals) groups can almost all agree with.

Ethanol ban is same story, same stupid restriction of freedom that leads to even worse outcome and solves nothing.

You could hoped that democracy of USA would get that message after failure of war on more dangerous drug - the ethanol when it created mafia and other problems, but nope.

You are wrong. Smart people like libertarians, free-market supporters known this for decades :) 
But, now we can simply let ***the facts tell the objective truth***
states that legalized marijuana see less drug use. 
(Not that drug use is bad).
People, look at the damn example at alcohol prohibition, it's same shit. How blind can you be to not use this lesson from history?

Cool, and now all the people who apparently can not read, maybe can stop running around and re-read what I written:
yes, luke-jr is "guilty" of by default enabling censorship flag in ebuild.
yes, he is "guilty" not because of religious views but because of ebuild.
BUT, I just say that when someone here started commenting his religion - then this is stupid and unproductive.
Do not comment his religion, that is silly.
Leave personal attacks out of this.
Just comment on his stupid ebuilds. Btw it seems we won and that flags was fixed now :)

It's his random personal idea, not something that has to do with the Bitcoin.
Hexadecimals could have some limited use, well but prices would be like 
5AF + 1F7 not like 3 + 1.
And even that seems crazy to normal currency user, if you pay
1AF milk
C12 pizza
D1C fruits
then how much btc you want to withdraw? 
I venture a guess that people thinking in above notation are ***rather*** a minority, to say at least :P

1. that is not proven actually
2. they did not allowed him to comment on that even a word
3. he was mainly doing that in response to being attacked
If laws would not idiotically ban some drugs, he would never had reason to choose such way as last resort of defense.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:57:18
He was not ever allowed to say a word of comment about that logs.

Lie, he ordered the hit to defend own life (life without being kidnapped by the state at least) - and even this is IF we assume what feds said was true, this evidence was not judged.

Good for him, if he stages hamster knife fights in basement with BTC (or TBC ;) bet payments as his pet project then all the best ;)
But the [most] official wiki maybe should describe some consensus, not pet ideas of one of the contributors presented as if it is normal part of Bitcoin.

I don't care if he contributed to curing cancer, in this thread we want the not crippled by default version of bitcoin in gentoo.
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:08:22




So we agree at this goal (I'm unsure about begging but let's fly with this)
Though forbidding people to use drugs is not justified (and even not an effective!) way to stop violent crime.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:09:16
The goal is to avoid free market, because then people can freely buy what they want at best prices possible for them.
Thanks to regulation (like anti "drug" laws), we create monopoly and allow the companies to rip us off. 
But unlike normal rip off as in marketing crap - you are arrested if you try to not be exploited and when you choose the cheaper/better option.

Farma repackages same weed and other drugs and sells them at much higher price, as "medical" things.
Marihuana is good medication for epilepsy - 
And obviously for pain, e.g. for cancer patients.

You mean it's better, cheaper, get's you the product without supporting the evil anti-freedom corps/agencies, and is cooler?
Damn right ;)

Yeah it's not "surprising" - but it is unfair, morally bad, that people are getting punished for breaking **bad law**.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:30:37


Ok let me just go right for most obvious example of how this rule is silly:
So a guy helping to escape some civilians from Hitler's German death camp would be bad, because he would be 'knowingly breaking the law, no matter how "unfair" it might be' - wut?

SpamAssasin is designed only to filter emails, it's obvious it will do it.
What you do, is like releasing a gentoo version of thunderbrid or other email client, that by default removes all emails from  and from  because you think they are mostly spam.
Bitcoin has build in solution to "spam" - the cost/txfee. 
Your "help" is not needed anyway, as the software has build in spam protection.

He was trying to save his life - from being kidnapped by the State - it was against blackmailer.
Funny, if running such market would be not punishable, there would be no reason for the "hit" anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:51:57




1. he did nothing wrong (just allowed people to decide what herbs they wish to use on OWN BODY).
2. at that point, X was going to attack him by making him kidnapped (to jail, because laws are retarded)
The bad person here would be the cops that would kidnap him, the prison guards, and the judge etc - but he decided he can not fight them so we want from the person releasing stolen information.
I do not say he should order the hit (he should not), but that is totally different to attack someone in defense from UNJUST prison based on "stolen" information - than to attack someone e.g. to fight competition, as you said previously.

bitcoin blocks spam by itself with cost of transactions. 
Luke adds his arbitrary views of what other things to block, like an email client that by default blocks  and  emails.  Though even that is more reasonable example, as emails often lack spam filtering - while bitcoin does have it built-in.
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:23:36


That sounds like a good idea


Not all. Fact that majority thinks something doesn't mean it's right.
It could mean it is right for them - e.g. most Americans would say it is ok to enslave Negros, still that was not a good thing.

Other people were rising a point that the "owner of SR wanted to order a hit" part was morally wrong.
I can agree that was quite bad, how ever this is not even a point in "was existence of SR good or bad" debate.
Cool, if you do not talk about this, but about the main SR business then it's simple: there is nothing wrong in SR morally, because ***people should be free to do what ever with own body, including use herbs that some local mob does not approve of***.

Ok maybe alcohol dropped a bit (to 60% but then back to 80%) but look at this:
In a study of more than thirty major U.S cities during the Prohibition years of 1920 and 1921, the **number of crimes increased by 24 percent**. Additionally, theft and burglaries increased by 9 percent, homicides by 12.7 percent, assaults and battery rose by 13 percent, 
**drug addiction [increased by] by 44.6 percent**, and police department costs rose by 11.4 percent. This was largely the result of "black-market violence"
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:38:43


For later stage - alcohol prohibition.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:07:08
People should have the right to harm they own selves.
I like my right to harm myself if I want to, fuck off please.
As for hurting others, we have already laws to stop that.
Why do people still repeat this idiotic fallacy, it is IDENTICAL to the ethanol prohibition created by woman in USA (good job, giving them voting rights btw).
They did it because "drunk husbands are beating wives".
So we could
1) ban drinking
2) ban beating wives
Prohibition was retarded because it targeted a freedom (to get drunk) instead just putting more effort in ALREADY EXISTING good law that got the problem covered - the law that you can not beat your wife (nor anyone else).

To known actual terrorists (not doublespeech "terrorists" like file sharers, but terrorists who murder civilians) - to ISIS, to Taliban.
