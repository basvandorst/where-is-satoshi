I would like to live in a world where people think a bit more about what they spend on.  Where putting money away for savings is actually helpful. Who knows, maybe it will get people to spend on things they actually need or really want and help with resource extinction and shit. This is all actually pretty doubtful, but as I am still young, I can hope.. barely.

Right now I am planning on workbenching it, and using regular fans that I have lying around to help with airflow.  We will see how this works, I may need something more

Get an account on mtgox.com, the rest should pretty much explain itself.

I would also direct you towards [the mining team subreddit]( This link was found in the sidebar, as well as some other useful links (like hardware mining rates).

It would take a fuckload of time to generate a block worth 50BTC on my own, but I joined a mining pool.  Basically pooled resources = blocks found on a semi-regular basis = more steady payout

Your right, I just have extras lying around, didn't think about including them for this estimate. Pretty cheap anyways.

1: Dunno
2: I am not going to be using a case, and I will be jerryrigging home fans around it. You are right about the keyboard, same with display. Then I will just ssh in.
3: Make sure your power supply will be able to handle it. (More watts)
4: Dunno. honestly this is my first rodeo, and I am just sticking my balls right into the anthill. Don't take any of my advice without that grain of salt. I have done a fair share of research though, for all thats worth.

27 days, 9 hours
using electricity rate of .15 USD/kWh
and a conversion rate of 17.3522 USD/BTC
Info using [this]( found on sidebar of the [mtred mining subreddit](
Also, overestimating power usage at a consistant 750W

From last slide:
* BitCoin isn't anonymous
* UPNP sometimes exposes itself to the outside world
* ACLs can be bypassed using some interesting sequence number tricks and large number of packets
* Passwords can be used to seed asymmetric crypto, though they probably shouldn't
* Subtle net neutrality hacks are doomed. Transparency or bust.
