Just because there's no constant, nneverchanging break even point of mining doesn't mean it's not there and it's definitely not nonsense. At any point of time some miners will go out of busines because they simply can't ht that point, while others become optimised enough to thrive.  
Just as in regular ore mining where the the breakeven flcutuates wildly moth to month, year to year depending on current market price of the ore, new deposits being discovered or old ones depleting, new technologies coming to market etc. 
And just as with bitcoin, when the breakeven gets too high and lots of miners can't continue production the supply will lessen, which eventually drives up the price (or in bitcoins case artificially eases the production) which then makes it easier to jump back into the game again.  
I can't think of any industry where there's a "rigid" break even as you phrased it, so what you're missing is probably the fact that it's something that doesn't change. Doesn't make it any less real, just a whole lot trickier for enterpreneurs to plan and work around.

In addition to that, if forestry machinery is used it is highly advantageous to cut trees after the ground is properly frozen, as it will prevent the wheels of the trucks/tractors from disturbing the soil too much, or sinking in and getting stuck. Winter is prime tree cutting time!

How is patreon not a reliable source of income if you can get enough backers?

Yeah, because up until now Koreans just couldn't go to the hospital if they didn't have enough cash on them, it's not like they were able to use debit/credit cards or mobile pay.
