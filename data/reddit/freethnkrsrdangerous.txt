He lost BCH, not BTC.

This is what I don't get about forked coins. I get it, the code needs updates along the way, and the easiest way to do major updates is with a fork, but if people are assigning any value at all to the forked coins, I would assume it doesn't create any value on top of what btc has, but would rather devalues it in the short term. It seems people forking for their own gain are just bringing the enitere community down in the process.
just seems like a bunch of people trying get rich quick schemes at the cost of other people in the crypto community.

I don't see how this helps anyone. It is arguable that the big push for bch assisted, if not caused the big crash last month. The tanking of the market nearly coincided with coinbases insider trading with Vers. In trying to pump his bch, he brought down the value of btc, and all other crypto as well. Add up 1 btc and 1 bch and you still have considerably less value now than you would pre- bch hype. I'm sure he made a decent buck for himself, but at the cost of everyone else. 
Of course he would not have been able to do this without the gullible masses giving bch value, but that is really what I'm getting at. By giving the fork coins value, we are hurting everything else in the process.

If 1/6 of your liquid assets is $100,000, you are rich.

Not true. I first bought in at 17500. It tanked, so I bought more at 15. Then it went down further. And I bought more. Rinse. Repeat.  My break even now is 11500, so all in all, doing all right, despite the unfortunate timing of my first purchase.

What he is saying is if you have 100k to spend on btc, you're either rich already or investing very irresponsibly, as you cannot afford to lose it should it tank in value.

Virginia (WV) is the real Virginia, much better and with greater mountain peaks than Virginia Core (VA).
