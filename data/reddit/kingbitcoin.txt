In addition to a distributed ledger for the Bitcoin currency, the blockchain will be - or is already being - used for: distributed DNS (ala Namecoin), voting and liquid democracy systems, legal contracts and records, including patents, copyright, etc. Chain of title will be noted on the blockchain, so think of things like programmatic deeds, registration for cars, etc . Electronics could also be a very interesting use for chain of title - a device that only turns on for its blockchain-verifiable owner is inevitable. I imagine Trezor-like devices are an obvious early application. Although seemingly antithetical, I imagine taxes may be paid using the blockchain.
And much more.

1. What does the platform have to do?
2. 3 months, at least. This is the typical accelerator session length, for example.
3. The solution to this problem is to define what is required in (1). The more clearly the problem is defined, the more comfortable you will be offering a guaranteed reward, as you know you will get a workable solution.
All this being said, I just started work on something that will work for this very issue, so you'll have at least one top-tier submission. Maybe you should just invest ;)

This has been discussed more times than there are Bitcoins in circulation.
The denominations of Bitcoin are currently based on the metric system's naming convention (which most people outside of the US are familiar with). For example, 0.001 Bitcoins is known as a millibitcoin. 0.000001 is a microbitcoin. The shorthand for these denominations could be as simple as removing the "bitcoin" such as milli or micro. Some people have taken to calling millibitcoins "embits". This is something that will evolve organically and cannot be centrally planned -- which should come as no shock to someone familiar with what Bitcoin is all about.
