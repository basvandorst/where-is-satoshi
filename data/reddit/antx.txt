Don't fall for this poor attempt of scamming.

Look, it's simple, if you have the password, unlock the private key that OP gave us, and move the coins around.

In that statement, they say:


Well, OP tells us it's exactly what they are doing.  To the pitchforks?

Repeat after me: "Past performance is not indicative of future results."
"Past performance is not indicative of future results."
"PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS."
Now. that doesn't mean patterns don't have strong similarities. But they are not correlated. Stop lying to yourself, thinking you can guess the future. No one can. I believe one can have glimpses, call it whatever you like, gut feelings, but that's it.

shtap. I can't salivate so much more than this.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:57:38
Please, don't call me that.

Yeah, you could be right.... who knows?!?!

According to my crystal ball, it cannot end in "91".
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:29:32
Ah, you're totally right. It's the reward halving that does that instead.

At this point, I'm not trusting OP's memory in the slightest.
* In other threads, I've seen characters before "211".
* He told me that there \*might\* be a "h" an an "H" after the "3 (In the past there was also an "a" before the "h/H".
I'm out also.

Absolutelly right. So it's just a shift of purchasing power, right?

I'm not a fervent believer in agalitarism, btw.
It's just that for a second, I failed to see .. or envision how things would change (or if they would) in  regard to money distribution.
I guess the only factual conclusion we can draw is, like you said, "wealth will transfer".
I appreciate your reply, thanks.

Good option: define "keypool" to a very high value in bitcoin.conf, before creating the wallet. Even better option: use an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet, which doesn't have this shortcoming. In any case, if you want to be your own bank, you should research these things...
