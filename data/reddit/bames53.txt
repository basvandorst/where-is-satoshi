The two descriptions are in fact equivalent.
As you acknowledge, if the bank lends out 90%, and that's deposited and 90% is lent out again, ad infinitum, then the bank ends up with 10x more in deposits than actually existed in cash. This is precisely the same as if when $1k in cash is deposited, the bank immediately uses that entire sum to meet reserve requirements to have $10k in deposits ($1k to the saver, $9k to borrowers).
Your question "How the hell do you lend out $9k if you only got $1k?" applies equally to both cases: in both cases the banks have lent out $9k and the total sum of cash is only $1k. Thus if you think one of the cases is implausible, sounds like some kind of fraud, is unwise, whatever, then you should probably think the same of both cases.

I believe you misunderstood what I said and missed my point. I will repeat my point using more simple language and then give an example.
Banks lending 90% of what they have and using 10% as a reserve
**is the same as**
using 100% as reserves to lend out 9x what they have.
Here is an example:
Person A deposits $1000 in cash.
The bank loans 90%, $900, to person B in cash.
Person B deposits $900 in another bank. (Deposits = $1000 + $900 = $1900)
That bank loans 90%, $810, to Person C.
Person C deposits $810 into a third bank. (Deposits = $1900 + $810 = $2710)
That bank loans 90%, $729, to Person D.
Ad infinitum. (Deposits =  = $10000)
Repeating this process infinitely means that the sum total of all deposits in banks will be $10000.
Now compare the above to a second situation:
Person X deposits $1000 in cash.
The bank uses this $1000 as reserves to back $10000 in deposits, meeting their 10% reserve requirement. So in addition to the $1000 in Person X's account, they can now create $9000 in deposits to loan out.
Note that in both cases:
 - the banks have $1000 in cash
 - the banks have deposits totaling $10000, which is $9000 more than they  received.

[_Money creation in the modern economy_][1] published in the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin.
It refers to the idea that deposited cash is used as a reserve to fund some multiple of that amount in lending* as "multiplying up central bank money." It says of this theory:


It says of the real process:


The actual system of control employed by central banks is more complicated than the simple money multiplier method, but understanding that additional complexity is not important for purposes, and going by the money multiple theory is adequate.

In both models the entire amount of cash ends up as reserves and customers draw only on deposits. This is the same between both models.

Just to clarify: plagiarism wouldn't be _illegal_ under an anti-IP  libertarian system. Whether it's 'okay' or not depends on how one defines 'okay,' and for most people that's not the same as being legal. Lots of  terrible things are legal. That's particularly true of a libertarian system since one of the important insights of classical liberalism is that a thing being 'bad' is not sufficient to justify violence (e.g., laws) to suppress it.
But then again, plagiarism isn't illegal today under strict IP regimes either. For example it's perfectly legal for me to publish Shakespeare's plays under my name.
A lot of people conflate plagiarism with the things IP laws are meant to directly prevent. Not only is it not true that IP laws outlaw plagiarism, it's also not true that we need IP laws to combat plagiarism. In any debate over IP if one side argues for IP laws on the basis of plagiarism that side is probably not very well informed about IP.

That description doesn't seem to match the [sanctions][1] listed by the US State Department.
From that page it looks like the sanctions are the following:
 - Seven listed people and anyone meeting some listed requirements are prohibited from entry to the US, their property in the US is frozen, donations cannot be made to them, and basically all transactions with them are prohibited to US persons.
 - US persons can't buy Venezuelan government debt with a maturity more than 30 days, or debt from their oil company with a maturity of more than 90 days.
 - US persons can't buy or use the "Petro" digital currency Venezuela set up (which is basically just another way for them to borrow money).
 - US persons can't accept either ownership or as collateral any of the Venezuelan government's "equity interest" in anything of which they own more than 50%. That would be things like government owned businesses or land, but not commodities like oil produced by the state owned oil company.
So it seems like the government of Venezuela is still free to sell oil, and they can still borrow money from people other than US persons and even from US persons if the maturity is very short (and if there's anyone fool enough to lend to them.) In particular they're apparently still selling oil to US oil companies [as recently as June 2018][2], though at levels far lower than their contractual agreements due to a steep decline in production.

Obviously double-spend transactions can never end up in a single blockchain unless there's a bug in the algorithm. So double-spend attacks are always about publishing two transactions, tricking someone into providing goods or services based on one of those, but then ultimately the other transaction being the one that the network accepts.
The example shown here is just another version of this, but hiding the double spend from the victim by sticking another couple transactions after the double-spend transaction. Apparently the BCH wallet doesn't bother checking all the earlier unconfirmed transactions.

[NYT editor in 2014:][1]
“The lead-up to the war in Iraq in 2003 was not the Times’s finest hour. Some of the news reporting was flawed, driven by outside agendas and lacking in needed skepticism. Many Op-Ed columns promoted the idea of a war that turned out to be both unfounded and disastrous.”
"Many readers have complained to me that The Times is amplifying the voices of hawkish neoconservatives and serving as a megaphone for anonymously sourced administration leaks, while failing to give voice to those who oppose intervention."
"I went back with the help of my assistant, Jonah Bromwich, and reread the Iraq coverage and commentary from the past few weeks to see if these complaints were valid. The readers have a point worth considering."
Repeating, uncritically and without skepticism, what one is told by anyone, let alone by governments, is not an unbiased or neutral method of reporting.

Given that blocks can be orphaned many of the ambiguities around transactions that haven't been broadcast on the bitcoin network also apply to transactions that are in the latest few blocks. For example, if transferring bitcoin between parties means it's 100% certain that network will validate transactions published by the receiving party sending outputs elsewhere, neither zero confirmation bitcoin transactions nor transactions that are in the latest few blocks qualify.
There's some threshold at which transactions such as zero confirmation transactions and the transactions produced on the lightning network without closing the channel qualifies as having 'sent' the bitcoin.

What you think of the source is immaterial. All of the pertinent facts in the article I linked are accurate. Even your own source acknowledges that in fact there was no ban (since a self-imposed ban is not a ban.) Here's [another source][1], an article written by a former CDC doctor and published by Public Radio International, titled "I worked at the CDC and if it really wanted to, it could study gun violence." The writer says:


The author links to another piece titled "CDC isn’t banned from studying gun violence; it’s just too scared to do its job."
Really the complaint regarding Congress in your source seems to come down to the fact that Congress isn't earmarking funds explicitly for research on gun violence. That's a pretty weak complaint and a far cry from the alleged ban. Looking at 2018's HR 1625, I see of the funds allocated to the CDC $173 million that could go to research on injury prevention and control, which could cover gun violence. If the Pentagon can "lose" $21 trillion from 1998 to 2015 then surely the CDC could find a way to funnel a few million from its $5.6 billion budget to research on guns.

That section\* means if Venezuela is owed money (say because they delivered oil and haven't yet been paid for it) then US persons can't buy that debt. It doesn't mean that a US person who bought oil can't pay off the debt they owe directly to the government of Venezuela. Paying for oil you purchase would not be considered a "purchase of debt" and so is not covered by that section.
I suppose it does mean that a non-US person can't send payment to purchase such debt through a bank in the US. But that section does not prohibit payment in US dollars via banks not in the US. The fact that direct sales of oil are not impacted, and that even the specific transaction that is covered is still possible in US dollars as long as the buyer is not a US person and any intermediaries are not in the US or US persons, indicates to me that this really is not a meaningful obstacle.
Aside from that, there's other evidence for the fact that Venezuela's oil exports to the US are not limited by any US sanctions preventing or otherwise obstructing anyone from buying oil: Venezuela is not producing oil in quantities sufficient to even [meet their existing contracts][2].




They are selling everything they are able to produce, so there's no extra oil sitting around that they could be selling if sanctions were lifted.
Sanctions obviously don't make things easier for the government, but I don't see any evidence that sanctions have actually been meaningful at all in terms of the hardships being suffered by Venezuelan citizens. Sanctions and the economic warfare alleged by Maduro just seem like excuses that really aren't responsible for anything. But I'm still open to evidence; The US certainly has a bad history in this part of the world.

The decline in oil production started long before any sanctions. Also producing oil ought to yield more money than it costs, so that's one way of funding re-expansion if they are capable of it at all.
And even if what you say about banking is true then why not just make sure they have those direct connections instead of apparently choosing not to? I suppose we can just allege secret deals between foreign banks and the US, but I'd want evidence. Otherwise I already have a simple explanation for everything that's happened in Venezuela, all based on their policies and not on anything the US has done.

Downvoting for the following reason. The fact that something is counter to "proper, safe usage" does not in fact make it "impossible." A miner could in fact refuse to include in blocks transactions that involve unapproved addresses. Hypothetically, if all miners did that and you continued to practice "proper, safe usage" then all that would happen is that your transactions would not get into the blockchain.

It really is undefined behavior to right shift by a value equal to or greater than the bit width. So yeah, when `nHeight` gets to `13440000` then `nHeight / 210000` will produce the value 64, and the behavior of `nSubsidy &gt;&gt; 64` is undefined.
One way this undefined behavior manifests is in fact 'wrapping'. x86 executes right shifts by masking off the more significant bits. Shifting a 64 bit value by 64 is effectively a shift by zero, a shift by 65 is effectively a shift by 1, etc.
Other platforms manifest this undefined behavior in other ways. For example on PPC I believe a right shift by the bit width or greater will produce zero.
However the above is only the hardware's right shift behavior. Other strange results can be produced by compilers because 'undefined behavior' gives them unlimited license. For example see the results of the following program compiled with different optimization levels:
- [Results at `-O0`](
- [Results at `-O2`](
The program:
     &lt;iostream&gt;
     &lt;cstdint&gt;
    using std::int64_t;
    constexpr int64_t COIN = 100'000'000;
    int64_t calculate_subsidy(int64_t nHeight) {
        int64_t nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
        nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= (nHeight / 210'000);
        return nSubsidy;
    }
        
    int main() {

There's an interesting story about the Somali Shilling related to this idea:
After the Somali government fell people in Somalia still continued to accept Somali Shilling notes, so they still continued to work as a money. Then people started counterfeiting the bills and so there was a lot of price inflation. It got to the point where, when a government engages in money printing, the government has to declare new denominations of bills so that it can continue printing more and more money.
But there was no government to declare new 'legitimate' denominations. Nobody would accept bills with higher denominations, and so the counterfeiters couldn't profitably print more money. Prices for goods in Somali Shillings stabilized with Shilling notes being valued at about the cost of the paper and ink used to print them. At that point, money would wear out and the scarcity would make it more valuable, until somebody could profit from printing some more, reducing the value again through the increased quantity of money and effectively maintaining a stable value.
The sort of hyperinflation that occurred in Zimbabwe just isn't possible without a government, or without government backing the hyperinflation. Without government either declaring new denominations or changing the money some other way (e.g., changing the materials, such as substituting cheaper metals in coins for more expensive metals) in order to maintain a low cost of manufacturing for ever-increasing amounts of money, it's just not feasible to keep making more money.

The price is set by demand for bitcoin. If some demand for bitcoin is met by trades that occur outside the exchanges then less demand is funneled through the exchanges than otherwise would be. This results in prices on the exchanges being lower than they otherwise would be.
For example, if people are trading at steady prices on the exchanges, and then many buyers stop buying on the exchanges because they can get BTC directly from Satoshi then the price on the exchange drops.

This analysis is based on only a very superficial understanding of Bitcoin. I think a correct analysis must instead rely on a deeper understanding of the 'behind-the-scenes technical details' that actually make up Bitcoin.
IMO what it comes down to is that one can cryptographically sign and then publish a document, and unless the information used to do this was acquired through violation of previously established property rights (e.g., the private key used in signing was obtained by breaking into somebody's house) then the simple act of signing and publishing a document cannot be considered a crime.
If one breaks into a house, therby obtains Bitcoin private keys, and then publishes documents using those keys, then I think the crime is the break-in, and the restitution owed for the break-in is increased by the amount of BTC 'stolen'.

Market prices are a useful piece of information. For example, prices can be used to efficiently allocate resources or to help predict events. Prices can be used for these things because they're essentially an aggregate of information that's distributed among many people, along with those people's value judgments of that information.
Adding more information to the pile, such as learning the price paid in one large purchase, can help lead to better predictions and resource allocation.

What's going on here is that blockchain.info is generating a qr code that contains exactly what you send via the `data` parameter. If you use `&amp;` to separate the amount parameter then the qr generator sees that as a separate parameter and so doesn't include it, but if you use `?` then the generator sees it as part of the data passed in the `data` parameter and therefore does include it.
The upshot is that to generate a QR code with an amount you should pass a complete "bitcoin:" URI in the data parameter. Although some wallets at least seem to be able to figure out the malformed `&lt;address&gt;?amount=&lt;amount&gt;` I think it's probably better to generate a well formed bitcoin URI.
 A bitcoin URI looks like:
    bitcoin:&lt;address&gt;?amount=&lt;amount&gt;&amp;label=&lt;URI escaped string&gt;&amp;message=&lt;URI escaped string&gt;
Where amount, label, and message are optional parameters, and the order of the parameters is irrelevant.
    bitcoin:1D5WrcV35FhKYM74FPVmzm1PJiZYJuoAPR?amount=1.00&amp;label=example%20label
To pass this data to the QR generator you need to add a second level of URI escaping. The two characters that need to be escaped to safely transmit through the URI or &amp; and %, because they have special meaning in a URI. The ? in the data does not need to be escaped because, after the initial ? marking the start of the query parameters, ? has no more special meaning.
Escaping % means replacing it with %25, escaping &amp; means replacing it with %26. So the final request to blockchain.info's QR code generator would be:

It sounds like in your analogy you're trying to put opponents of fractional reserve banking as the people trying to smooth over booms and busts and thus causing the conditions that produce firestorms.
I would argue it's more accurate to put central bankers in that position due to their attempts to maintain economic stability in aggregate measures of the economy, and that they furthermore have a policy of dousing everything in gasoline (fractional reserve banking).
Typically opponents of fractional reserve banking are also opponents of central banks trying to manage the economy that way, opposed to 'too big to fail', and opposed economic intervention in general. In fact my impression is that, though they believe this analysis of fractional reserve banking which shows it has bad effects, they would not support State intervention to stop the practice if it developed in the market, so long as banks are open about the practice (i.e. they're not defrauding depositors) and do not get any taxpayer backed guarantees.
So opponents of factional reserve banking would seem to me to be in the position of arguing against both artificially protecting the economy _and_ artificially destroying it through State supported fractional reserve banking.

Hmmm, so if the price deflation is due to economic growth then that indicates that on average resources are being used to grow the economy at 2%, and your idea to use resources will under-perform and therefore be bad for the economy.
It seems like price deflation with a stable monetary base would encourage _good_ investment and discourage _bad_ investment, whereas price inflation occurring as a result of monetary inflation would encourage _all_ investment, including investment that under-performs the average (but which is still better than losing to price inflation) and which therefore reduces economic growth.

There are programs that rely on it.
Some things you can do:
- Make sure that /bin/sh does not point to bash
- remove /bin/bash from the file /etc/shells, which lists executables that are permitted as user shells. (Be sure to change your user shell to something other than bash before you do this.)
- And of course go ahead and update bash. Even though that doesn't completely fix the issue it does reduce some of the really low hanging fruit for attackers.
Removing bash completely risks damaging your system (depending on your distro and configuration) and you probably shouldn't do it unless you know enough to repair any damage. Even the above steps might cause some problems, but you should be able to fix them later by just reversing those changes.
If anyone else has any other good recommendations they should post them.

miners create potential blocks, with whatever transactions they want. After they pick the transactions they have to find a 'nonce' which, when inserted into the block, makes the block pass the network's difficulty test to get the block accepted into the blockchain. Finding a nonce that works for a particular list of transactions is difficult, and the network can adjust the difficulty to make it take longer or shorter.


Only the miner that creates the block gets to put transactions into the block. This is because the successful 'nonce' depends on the entire list of transactions in the block. The list of transactions in a block cannot be changed, or a new nonce has to be found that works with the new list of transactions.


No. The network actually modifies the difficulty test such that, however much computer power miners have, all the searching by all those miners will take about 10 minutes to find one block. Basically the miners are blindfolded people continuously throwing darts, and the network adjusts the size of the bullseye to make sure that on average only one person hits it every ten minutes.
Bitcoin could have been designed such that miners could easily create a block in seconds, but then thousands of miners around the world would be finding blocks all at the same time and the network would have a much more difficult time choosing which block was 'real'. You could get multiple competing blockchains. So basically the time required to generate a block is tuned so that it has time to propagate across the network before it's very likely that any other miner finds a different block.

Those are per kilobyte fees, so for most transactions, which are around 1/4 kB. So for a transaction to be included in the next 6 blocks costs around 6 cents, being included in the next block would cost 30 cents.
I wouldn't think that there's much risk in accepting zero confirmation microtransactions anyway. Then again maybe the blockchain isn't the place for microtransactions.

There are different kinds of money creation. Banks can certainly create and destroy money through fractional reserves and lending, etc, which affects the higher measures of the money supply, but the Federal Reserve is in control of banks' accounts there (though its debatable whether the Fed should be considered private or public) which controls MB, and the US Treasury is directly in control of coining money which allows them to control M0 (e.g., the trillion dollar platinum coin that was suggested a while back).
If the government wants to increase the money supply then they can do so without the cooperation of banks. For example they can mint their trillion dollar coin, deposit it with the Fed, then print the appropriate Federal Reserve Notes, and mail those to people. (The Fed's cooperation here is legally mandated, so it doesn't matter if you consider the Fed to be private.) The government can increase the money supply by any amount it chooses using this method, no matter what the banks do.
If the government wants to decrease the money supply it can do so through taxes. Additionally, if the Fed cooperates then the money supply can be reduced by modifying reserve requirements, and thus reducing the amount of money created by banks.
So even using these relatively tame means the government has more than just 'a moderate say in some aspects' of the money supply. And if we consider more extreme means then the government has even more control, via bank nationalization, liberal use of its legislative power, and even the military.

Even counterfeit Somali shillings are accepted as fungible with the pre-1991 notes.
The actual constraint on inflation is that there hasn't been any government authority to declare new, larger denominations, so nobody accepted bills with higher denominations. That means that the cost of production cannot be arbitrarily reduced, and market forces limit production of notes to the amount that keeps the purchasing power at right around the cost of production.

Yes, that would apply to deterministic seeds. If two people happen to pick the same seed then they'll get the same private keys and thus will have access to all of each other's addresses. But if you pick a random deterministic seed properly then there should be as much chance of that as there is of Bitcoin-Qt generating the same private key for more than one person. I.e. practically impossible.

No, they need Bitcoin-Qt's wallet file as well. The pass phrase used by Bitcoin-Qt is simply a key used to encrypt the file.


No, they are two different things.
The wallet pass phrase is simply an encryption key for encrypting the wallet file. Deterministic seeds have nothing to do with encrypting the wallet file. Instead, deterministic seeds are a method of creating private keys.
Bitcoin-Qt just creates completely random private keys, so without the wallet data then you cannot recover the private keys. But with deterministic seeds the seed is used to create a sequence of private keys, and those private keys can be recreated as long as you have the seed.

Banks can behave as you describe; keep $10 as reserves for the depositor and then lend out the other $90 as cash, but typically they don't. Instead they loan money out by creating an account at the bank, so they can keep the cash as reserves and therefore loan out more.
So actually the OPs description was accurate. Deposit $100 dollars with the bank, and given a 10% reserve requirement the bank can credit customers up to $1000 dollars. They can create a $100 dollar account for the depositor and then create another $900 in accounts for borrowers.
Furthermore, the situation you describe is equivalent as long as borrowers deposit the cash they borrow in some bank and that bank only keeps the 10% required reserves, lending out the rest: all the banks together will have $100 in cash and will have credited a total of $1000 dollars to account holders.
$100 * sum(i=0..inf, 0.9^i) = $1000

I certainly agree that making announcements is good. In fact over in the BIP-1337 thread I suggested that should be the standard method:


'deserving' to lose it doesn't make it okay when somebody else takes it. You're essentially arguing that announcing the weak keys and having somebody actually take and keep the BTC is somehow morally superior to somebody just taking the BTC for safe-keeping until it can be returned to the owner.

Maybe one thing you could do is abandon the euphemistic turns of phrase that are typically used. E.g. 'owning bitcoin' is simply a euphemism, and you do not and cannot literally 'own' bitcoin the way you can own, say, a spork.
Instead you can speak to the accountant in literal terms: You know some secret information (the private keys) which has a certain market value, because people will pay you in USD, or goods or services to use that secret information to publish certain documents.
Be sure to point out that the market value is not for actually disclosing the secret, and that the value of the information can actually increase or decrease based on the documents you and other people publish (that is, other people can publish documents that increases the value of your secret, and you can publish documents that decrease its value).

Instead of a protocol for requesting lost coins back I think it would be better to establish a system for posting coins that have been taken for safe-keeping.
Maybe that system would be a blockchain based protocol, or maybe it would be web sites set up by volunteer organizations, perhaps with some federated protocol between them so that searching on one organization's site would return results from the others.
I think the benefit of this is that it's known, up-front, whether the coins have been stolen* or are simply being kept safe.

It would be a whitelist, and nothing about such a system is prevented by the practice you describe. Secure practices do not prevent a whitelist from working. Cause and effect goes in the opposite direction: a whitelist prevents that secure practice from being possible.
Nor does 'laziness' matter. Even if everyone used secure practices before the miners all implemented a whitelist, that would do nothing to prevent whitelisting. After all the miners started using a whitelist it would be 'impossible' to continue using that secure practice.


In your mind developers would make it easy to use secure practices which would result in users using secure practices which would somehow force miner to accept whatever transactions users want. In fact miners can accept or reject transactions based on whatever criteria they want which in fact forces users to make their transaction match the criteria miners want which influences developers to make clients where users can more easily create the transactions that meet the miners criteria.
The fact that miners can refuse to process transactions is the whole reason 51% attacks are even possible. In fact you can think of the premise of the discussion as a 51% (or much higher) attack. Whitelisting is one of the things a 51% attacker can do.

Hmmm, that's an interesting article, but I think it's incorrect.


The writer of the above appears to be laboring under the misapprehension that 'bitcoins' are things that are transferred between owners. Although the Bitcoin protocol goes to some lengths to simulate exactly that, that does not in fact reflect reality. In terms of real assets, what the bakery has is some information (the private keys) that allows them to publish documents, the publication of which has a market value.
Certainly the bank would have some claim to that information but, given the real nature of bitcoin, those claims don't extend to any third party's secret information. If the bakery attempts to defraud the bank somehow by 'transferring bitcoin' then it should be treated the same as if the bakery destroyed the private keys or used them to publish a document that 'sends bitcoin' an 'unspendable' output: in all cases what has occurred is that the bakery fraudulently harmed the utility or market value of the secret information that the bank has an interest in.
To tie in the 'bitcoin is property' thing: The IRS's declarations do not change the real nature of bitcoin. Bitcoin is what it is regardless of how the IRS taxes it. The IRS simply stated that they're going to assess taxes in a certain way. They could also tax transfers of physical goods under their rules for taxing services performed if they cared to, but that wouldn't literally turn goods into services.
Law, however, is different. Law is supposed to deal with the real nature of things, not simply arbitrary categories divorced from real meaning. IMO the laws and precedents that are probably most applicable to the real nature of bitcoin is trade secret law applied to private keys.

This is easy. Bitcoin involves two kinds of validation: digital signatures that prove who authored a transaction, and voluntary rules that govern what transactions get accepted. FedCoin would simply have different voluntary rules.
One method might be that every node on the FedCoin network would recognize certain addresses and allow them to author whatever transactions they want. These addresses could credit any account without having to prove they have the funds to transfer
Of course there's no point in a 'crypto' currency that has this backdoor built in. You might as well just have a server set up at the fed that just contains a database of accounts instead of using a decentralized, peer to peer protocol. Or maybe servers at each bank... Just like the current system.

What you mean is, other people get to choose what blockchain they reference to determine valid transactions as well. I don't even have to agree that their blockchain is valid. For example I might send a transaction that I regard as an invalid double-spend, but if they consider it valid then that doesn't matter to me.
But not coming to any agreement on a single shared blockchain is not analogous to choosing, in a democracy, to flee the territory (or be captured and sent to jail). A better analogy would be secession, though even that's not a great analogy.

Saving often does not mean saving in a bank account that gets lent out. For example putting money in a piggy bank is called saving.
Furthermore those that disapprove of 'hoarding' also often want to discourage saving in bank accounts. They often advocate low interest rates in order to disincentivize saving so that people will instead simply blow the money on consumer goods.
And of course pulling money out of circulation is itself a kind of investment in the future. The resources that would otherwise be used are instead left in the economy for others to use, affecting marginal prices and capital production. The 'hoarder, obviously feels that the future consumption enabled by 'hoarding' will be more satisfying than present consumption.

Because the group with more guns than anyone else says so.
Anyway, all they're doing is informing people they have power over what is required of them. When they classify something as 'property' or 'currency', they're simply using these as names of categories for which they have other rules. They're not talking about philosophy and saying that bitcoin really is property. They're simply saying "To figure out how much we're going to take from you look at the category A rules instead of the category B rules."


No challenge on the grounds that bitcoin is not really property has any chance of success, because as I said, they're not making a philosophical assertion about the nature of property and bitcoin.


These guidelines by the IRS don't represent some radical departure from their previous behavior, and they're not going to go around taxing people in radically different ways. Those other instances of 'code/language/communication' have already been categorized by the IRS, and those assigned categories aren't changed just because the IRS has now categorized bitcoin.
If you're concerned with the philosophy then here's what I think.
The code is just an implementation of a protocol. What matters is the protocol, which is just some rules people have agreed upon. When you buy something with bitcoin you're just saying some magic words. The merchant accepts your speech of those magic words in exchange for his goods because, having said them, anyone else who follows the rules will accept the merchant saying some magic words in exchange for something else. You're effectively performing a service for the merchant, rather than transferring anything.
I think a coherent philosophy of property rights must conclude that bitcoin 'balances' are not in fact property. That may lead to some uncomfortable conclusions, but I don't think it would be a problem in practice.
For example, if one learns someone else's private key in any non-property rights violating way (an (incredibly) lucky guess, the other person flashes it on TV without realizing what they're doing, etc.), it's not actually theft to then say magic words that cause everyone to update the 'balances' of various bitcoin addresses according to the rules of bitcoin. On the other hand, if one breaks into another's home in order to learn the necessary secret information then the 'harm' caused by the break-in is based on how valuable the secret information was, so the damages owed for the break-in would correspond to how much bitcoin was 'stolen'.

Actually it's the runaway corruption causing the unequal distribution and continuing concentration of wealth; If the distribution were 'leveled' without fixing the underlying problem then the same corrupt people would set about doing the same corrupt things to their own advantage at the expense of others. (Their influence and power to do corrupt things is not directly related to how much wealth they have, so taking away their wealth doesn't stop them.)
On the other hand, if the underlying corruption were fixed then the distribution of wealth would cease concentrating and would instead trend toward an equitable distribution.

Not under an inflationary policy. Say there's the same 2% real economic growth as I assumed for the deflationary case.
In the deflationary case you could buy some resources to implement your 1% idea or leave those resources for others to put to better use, in which case you earn 2% due to those other people doing better than your 1% idea. Obviously you choose to let others implement their better ideas.
In the inflationary case you have the same choice of spending your money to create 1% real value (and some higher percentage in nominal value due to inflation), and you have the same choice of not spending money, leaving resources on the table for other people to create 2% real value (and some much higher percentage in nominal value), but because of inflation you don't benefit by allowing other people to pursue their better ideas this way. Instead the better choice between these two options is to implement your 1% idea and to thus destroy that much value in the economy overall.

Value is subjective, so of course it can be anything. That's not the same as saying it was anything; objectively people did have some actual reason for using it.
The reason it's important is because it's the first step, and the existence of a first step is what shows that money is not based on circular reasoning where it has exchange value just because other people accept it because it has exchange value.
(And even if you believe that the origin of money was not an evolution from barter, it still works; just substitute whatever it is you think is the correct origin.)

There is a difference between the two things, however. A policy of socializing losses essentially supports and encourages losses, changes how real resources are organized for the worse, and generally causes real harm.
Market prices fluctuating freely based on the panics or enthusiasms of the day, on the other hand, is part of a discovery process by which knowledge is gained.

"It's taking IP that isn't yours whether taking IP that isn't yours is legal or not."
Overlooking the sloppy use of 'taking' and the possessive form, I agree with that statement.
On the other hand, if you mean that "taking IP that isn't yours" is fraud, I don't agree.
One of the things wrong with IP is that it undermines real property rights. When someone enforces a patent, for example, what they're essentially doing is claiming a property right in all goods owned by anyone else, a right which allows them to control to a certain extent how the rightful owners of those goods are allowed use their property. In effect, enforcing IP is a wrongful taking of property from everyone else.

The article's premise, that the only requirement is that the problem be hard to solve and easy to verify, is false. The computation doesn't just have to 'involve' the string of transactions: the problem solution needs to be _unique_ to the string of transactions. In fact it needs to be hard to come up with the solution unique to the string of transactions and easy to verify that it's unique to that string of transactions.
If I can solve any old folding problem and then tack that onto a block of transactions then there's no proof that those transactions occurred before the folding work was done. Nor is there any proof that that folding solution can't be tacked onto some other block of transactions. Without these qualities the blockchain ceases to perform its function as a cryptographically secure timestamp.

If you know the principle and the annual rate then you can calculate the value after two years. Since you know the value after two years, but not the rate, you can use algebra to rearrange that equation to calculate the annual rate.
P * (1 + r)^t = V
996 * (1 + r)^2 = 3784 ⇒  
(1 + r)^2 = 3784/996 = 3.79 = 1 + 2.79 ⇒  
1 + r = sqrt(1 + 2.79) ⇒  
r = sqrt(1 + 2.79) - 1 = .94  
So rather than dividing by two, you take the square root (or more generally the nth root to go from a rate over n years to one year) after adjusting from % increase to pure %.

As for blaming sanctions, last year when I looked into existing sanctions at that time I couldn't find any plausible explanation for how sanctions were responsible. Perhaps sanctions since then have had some negative effects on the people, but that can't be blamed for the things that happened before.

There are a number of issues with several of the arguments in the sources you're quoting. First I see things that have happened in Venezuela blamed on sanctions without pointing out specifically how any actually existing sanctions would cause that. For example:


We might look at Venezuela's economy and see it's paralyzed, but that's insufficient to determine that the sanctions played a role in causing the paralysis.
A second issue is blaming sanctions for things that didn't happen, as far as I can tell:


This was an allegation I looked into before and as far as I could tell Venezuela's oil exportation had not been blocked. The amount they exported was not limited by any sanctions, but purely by their production capability. They had contracts to deliver oil, including to US companies, and they simply couldn't produce enough to meet those contracts. That is, they would have not have been prohibited by any sanctions from exporting more oil than they did.
Another issue is listing things that may have happened but not as a result of any sanctions, as far as I can tell:




The same article also says "Sanctions did not cause the economic or humanitarian crisis in Venezuela as dire conditions in Venezuela preceded the implementation of sanctions." After the economy was destroyed by the government's policies, causing a humanitarian crisis, and causing the government to be unable to pay for various imports, perhaps the crisis could still be addressed by the government getting 'financing' (i.e., loans) to pay for medicine it otherwise couldn't afford. There were sanctions prohibiting US persons from providing loans with maturities longer than 30 days. Obviously with the government broke they'd probably need much longer maturities than that. So that's a way sanctions could possibly be to blame for some suffering by the Venezuelan people.
However, there are issues with this line of argument. For example, if such financing were provided, would the government actually use it for food and medicine? The same article says that with previous financing "Maduro’s regime has neglected to provide food and medicine to the Venezuelan people. Instead, they have directly profited from these revenues, funding illicit projects and buying the loyalty of military officials." So that sounds like a reason that stopping such financing actually could not be blamed for the regime not purchasing food and medicine. Another issue is, is such financing to the government the only way food and medicine could be imported? I think that also is not the case; private entities not subject to the sanctions could (and [do][1]) provide such things. For these reasons, as well as the fact that it is the government's policies causing the crisis in the first place leading to the need for such imports, I don't think that sanctions can be blamed for any Venezuelan's suffering resulting from sanctions preventing the government from borrowing money.
[1]: 
I believe all of the ways of blaming sanctions in your sources fall into one of the above three categories: blaming something that happened on sanctions with no clear causal chain from an actually existing sanction, blaming sanctions for something that doesn't appear to have happened, or blaming things other than sanctions for something that happened. If you see something that doesn't fall under one of these categories please point one out and I'll address it directly. For now I'll conclude by addressing your own concluding paragraphs.


I don't see any sanctions that cut the private sector off from credit.


What sanctions caused that? Also, whatever caused it, it seems to have been temporary because from other sources I'm seeing that the insulin was held up for "several days." I haven't seen any allegations that Venezuela didn't get the insulin.


According to Venezuelan officials themselves this also does not appear to have been caused by US sanctions: "On Nov. 3, Vice President Tareck El Aissami, denounced that Venezuela had purchased in Colombia a shipment of Primaquine, an anti-malaria medicine, but, "Once the laboratory (BSN Medical) knew the final destination was the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela's Health Ministry, it arbitrarily blocked the dispatch of this medicine on the orders of Colombia’s president.”


I see in Venezuelan state media that Venezuelan officials "linked this issue to the sanctions imposed last August by the United States, prohibiting citizens of that country from negotiating new debt issued by the Venezuelan government and oil company PDVSA." However I don't see exactly how that sanction would lead to this occurrence.


I'm aware of some of those, but again it's not sanctions that are causing those things to happen.

I appreciated that  in your earlier post you made explicit the claim you were rebutting, including quoting my statement making that claim: "Sanctions obviously don't make things easier for the government, but I don't see any evidence that sanctions have actually been meaningful at all in terms of the hardships being suffered by Venezuelan citizens." I would note that the fact that sanctions can and have in many places and times caused suffering among the people of the nations targeted is not a challenge to my worldview. I am a non-interventionist in general and do not approve of many things the US government does exactly because they do often have such bad consequences. The issue is only whether the specific sanctions that exist in this case are responsible for specifically alleged consequences here.
That different sanctions elsewhere have caused suffering elsewhere might be an indication that sanctions here may cause suffering here, as a first approximation. I would not have been surprised to find that the allegations about the Venezuelan sanctions had merit at the time I looked into them. However that's just not what I found on deeper examination.


In general I'd agree, so don't mistake my position for support for sanctions. However the question is whether or not sanctions in this case have done the specific things they have been alleged to do, not whether sanctions in other places often have caused suffering.


The only evidence of that I've seen presented is that the people are suffering, and the argument goes that therefore it must be the sanctions that caused it. If that is true then we should be able to identify the exact causal chain connecting the two. However if we can't identify a plausible causal chain then there's less reason for believing the sanctions to be at fault.


An alternative purpose of sanctions, presented by one of your sources, is that sanctions are intended to cut the government off from revenue sources that it had been using to bribe officials. If that's what sanctions are supposed to do then the fact that elites aren't missing meals doesn't mean the sanctions aren't targeting elites, and the fact that the masses are missing meals doesn't mean it's the sanctions that caused that.


Only if we assume that it is the sanctions that have these effects, which is the point under contention.


By the same token I wouldn't simply accept that everything bad in these places is also caused by sanctions without looking at the sanctions and finding some plausible causal chain from what they do to the alleged bad consequences.
For example looking at sanctions on Iraq during the 90s I'd see that the U.N. resolution against them sought to ban "the import of all products and commodities originating in Iraq and Kuwait;" which clearly would have a direct impact on private businesses exporting goods from Iraq.


To the degree Bitcoin allows that I agree it's a good thing. To the degree Bitcoin allows innocent people to escape any monetary controls it's a good thing. For example the people of Venezuela using Bitcoin to preserve their purchasing power from the depredations of the Venezuelan government's money printing is another thing I like to see.


There's a [video][1] of Chavez walking through Caracas pointing at various private properties and issuing orders to [expropriate][2] them. The state has nationalized [many businesses][3] and run them at a loss. These are examples of capital consumption, a method of producing a temporary boost of income in the present at the expense of future income. Such a boost can be very good politically for the government, but unfortunately the future eventually becomes the present.




Looking again at the sources you provided, I don't think that's an accurate characterization of what they contained. And I'm not even asking you for that. I'm only asking for some plausible connection between actually existing sanctions and the alleged consequences for the people of Venezuela.
Constructing a narrative that makes sense is all well and good, but if that narrative blames things like sanctions banning Venezuelan oil imports, and then I discover that Venezuelan oil imports aren't banned by the sanctions, then I think it's reasonable to be skeptical of the narrative.


I didn't quote every word of your post but I did read it all and I do think every single point raised in them fell into one of the three categories I listed. As for sources, I did quote sources: your own sources such as that one which said sanctions weren't responsible for the crisis and implied that sanctions weren't what prevented the government from buying food or medicine with financed money.

You're doing it again. Libertarians don't actually say those things so they couldn't ever backpeddle from such claims.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:36:02


If you're arguing that libertarian policies dismantle the things that cause people to cooperate and so the voluntary interactions we see in daily life would therefore largely cease, that seems like a rather extraordinary claim which would need support. We also have reason to believe that doesn't necessarily happen, [for example][1]. Instead the null hypothesis that human nature doesn't radically change due to a change in magnitude of State influence and so the level voluntary cooperation wouldn't radically change from what is often observed in everyday interactions between private individuals seems quite moderate and reasonable.
On the other hand perhaps you believe that the average, everyday amount of cooperation isn't sufficient for libertarian policies, and instead they can only work when people exercise super-human levels of cooperation. That position also I think would have to be supported, since, unlike some ideologies, libertarianism does not posit any changes to human nature, some kind of libertarian version of the "new Soviet man," and I don't see what in particular would make anyone think such a change in human nature would be required.
[1]: 


That's obviously not something claimed by libertarians, and in fact implicitly rejected by much of what libertarians write. They can't be presupposing that individuals will always keep their personal behaviors from impacting others if they're writing articles about how to address and remedy, in a libertarian way, individuals' behaviors impacting other people. What you've got here is just a caricature of libertarianism.






See, here you're trying to prove a negative: that there's no actual reasons that libertarians could possibly have come to any of the conclusions that they have. You're just stating a poor caricature of libertarian beliefs, eliding all of the reasoning either because you're unaware of it or pretending it doesn't exist, and then saying, "See, I didn't describe the reasoning so therefore it doesn't exist, and so libertarianism is all just religion and faith." But this does not actually succeed at proving the negative.
For example presenting libertarianism as "The existence of many laws, regulations, or government policies are therefore unnecessary and probably more harmful than just leaving it up to people," pretends that libertarians haven't written or even read, good journalism on specific policies showing exactly how and why they are harmful. It just elides all that and replaces it with, "well, probably all policies do more harm than good." Or saying "totalitarian government has been generally bad, and freedom/capitalism has been generally good, ergo more capitalism and freedom and less government will be better," pretends things like research on the relationship and causality between economic freedoms and metrics of social wellbeing doesn't exist.


I find it's quite the opposite: that those who take a Hayekian viewpoint, for example, are far more likely to be sensitive to the fact that the world is a complex place and, for example, isn't always amenable to plans the way supporters of central planning expect, or that things may not work out in unexpected ways.


Libertarians don't claim all the solutions are easy (that would be another strawman) but this demonstrates pretty well one common error: the above implies that if some problem hasn't been solved you just need more money (a common refrain for education, no matter how much is already being spent), or you just need better central coordination or more power (because a failing bureaucracy couldn't possibly be due to perverse incentives; i.e. it couldn't possibly be that the agents are all coordinating wonderfully, just not with the goal of achieving what you want). If something isn't working, or isn't working as well as one might want, just doing the same thing but harder, with more money and more power, doesn't necessarily work any better. Sometimes the problem isn't a lack of money or power. Sometimes the world is more complex than that.

No, there's certainly no suggestion in libertarian ideology that once certain institutions are done away with everything left is trustworthy. That's a completely uninformed view of libertarianism. Libertarians don't claim that there aren't private criminals, scammers, etc., that there aren't social ills that would still exist and which should be dealt with somehow.
So what's absurd is this misunderstanding of libertarianism.


That's a ridiculous mis-characterization. The owner of the plane, the guy that will be liable for damage, is the one that has the most interest in coming up with the right rules and who also has the legitimate authority to impose them. Some monopoly that's subject to things like public choice theory and other perverse incentives may or may not impose correct rules for some things but is likely to impose a one-size-fits all policy that's worse for other things.


Being libertarian doesn't mean not recognizing such social harms or thinking that they're okay.
Hurting people and stealing are of course things that libertarians believe can be forcefully defended against. If some addict is breaking into a home then having some sort of police stop the break-in, even using violence if necessary, is something that libertarians support. But libertarians are at least economically literate enough to see that the prevalence of such crime is _increased_, not decreased, by the drug war today. It's supporters of the drug war who deserve ridicule for their ignorance of the effects of their chosen policy on causing more addicts to hurt people and steal than otherwise would, not libertarians.
First, making drugs illegal drives up the cost of drugs. Addicts have low demand elasticity which means they don't reduce the amount they want very much when the price increases. This results in thefts that wouldn't otherwise happen. The increased cost also means addicts may be more deprived of other things than they otherwise would be. These are bad effects that should be opposed by anyone wants to reduce the harms caused by drugs to either society in general or the addicts themselves.
Another effect is that drugs are made more potent: because of the risk involved only the most profitable products are worth dealing in, so the low profit, low potency drugs disappear and high profit, high potency drugs are substituted. We saw the same thing with alcohol prohibition where beer disappeared and harder drinks replaced it. The increased potency means the health hazards are also increased. Again, the policies supposedly aimed at reducing harm end up increasing it.
Then of course there are the effects of jailing people who aren't addicts and who would otherwise be productive members of society, good parents, etc. If we rounded up everyone who consumes alcohol today that would obviously have very bad effects, and not many of those people really cause problems that justify removing them from society, even if they do have unhealthy habits that we want reduced. The same is true with drug users.
Drug criminalization does mean that some people who might consume drugs if they were legal or cheap never do, and so some people who would otherwise become addicts don't. That's some small reduction in harm. However that is vastly dwarfed by hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed unnecessarily, the violence caused by the black market that's created, children growing up without parents, etc. all caused by the drug war, not drugs. Completely legalizing all drugs would be hugely beneficial for society even if we didn't implement any new policies to reduce social harms from drugs; criminalization really has proven to be that harmful. But of course we could also implement policies that actually do net good and that would be even better than just legalization. Those policies don't have to involve shooting or raping people innocent of any legitimate crimes or doing anything else that libertarians object to.


The NAP is a normative principle that says people shouldn't commit aggression, not a descriptive principle that says they don't. The NAP also distinguishes aggression from violence defending against aggression. Violence to stop aggression is permissible under the NAP.

No, I don't think what I said indicates any of that, or that libertarians in general fail to recognize that individuals in society make up lots of different structures. But really I don't see how this is connected to this thread of the conversation.


I could quibble with that characterization, but that doesn't even matter because "there should be less of it" doesn't imply that laws are all gone and people will be able to freely go around harming one another.


Again, the suggestion that looking at something that exists and thinking "Hey, that thing that exists is actually something that can exist," is faith.


Better job? More trustworthy? Why would these be necessary? Are you saying something that is only as good at this as government currently is would be unacceptable?
Whether the method is more ethical or not is of course subject to analysis.


Of course that's stating the conclusions far too strongly and narrowly based. We're not just talking about a few gated communities, but also other places like some regular, un-gated residential areas. The examples don't offer ironclad proof of anything except that it's possible, and if you think that ironclad proof is required to count as not being faith-based, then I guess you've got a lot of faith in lots of things. According to this test, if you listen to the weather forecast and hear it might rain then taking your umbrella is just completely faith-based, religious activity that outs you as a ridiculous nutjob. Using the term 'mercenary' is just like one tactic used by people opposed to all-volunteer military service, and just as valid.


My criticism is that you're calling it faith-based. Whether you think it's ridiculous or not is irrelevant.


You're the only one here that keeps talking about proof.


Your word again. Hey, do you have proof that your preferred system always solves everything perfectly?


No. This is just your imagination. It's like if I reference an existing private firefighting service, with trucks and everything, and you're saying it's a bucket brigade. Maybe you don't know what a bucket brigade is? Perhaps you think the words refer to the method of funding rather than the method of firefighting?


Just to be clear though, you seem to be doing the reckless extrapolation here.


As if that's the only method. Also I wonder if you think rural fire departments are all just bucket brigades too.


No, the ideology is founded on various values. Then various analyses of policies, plus the values, pops out judgements about policies, and then the policies that exist can be checked to see if they're good or bad. Maybe you think the ideology is literally nothing but question begging on those policy judgements such that the final judgements are literally the premises, but in that case you are eliding, again, everything in-between. Whether you can see it or not, it should be clear to any other readers, even non-libertarians who think libertarianism is ridiculous, that the ideology contains more than that. Ignoring those things doesn't show they don't exist.


Well, that at least we can agree is completely ridiculous. The idea that a policy came to be as an expansion of the state wherein the state grew to cover new areas by enacting new policies? Insane. That, sir, is obviously a _reduction_ in the size of the state. These new policies are all consequences of _reductions_.


These are just assertions you haven't supported here. But at least libertarianism as been promoted from baseless religion to simply unjustified extrapolation from too-few case studies.

No it doesn't. Just because there's the slightest "change in magnitude of State influence" doesn't mean law enforcement is eliminated. Do you know what a small percentage of taxes go toward things like police to prevent/solve thefts, murders, etc? Do you know that there are more private police than public police?


Also you're still ignoring the evidence. I guess you're just dismissing anything that doesn't line up with your preconceived notions as 'pseudo-poliscientific fratboy literature from obviously compromised "think tanks"' but that is not an argument. Just dismissing things that are inconvenient for you doesn't invalidate them.


No, the owners and residential associations can make people drive the speed limit under even the most extreme forms of libertarianism. Even today much of this is done using money gathered privately, and the people voluntarily paying for that are doing so on top of taxes they already pay which don't go to enforce those speed limits. That you think this can't be done is just another example of your ignorance.


So in other words, if someone looks at evidence, arguments, facts, and comes up with any conclusion other than yours, you will always dismiss it as 'faith'. Perhaps we should sit in a big room with pews and just listen to you so that we can finally be cleansed of all our faith and instead become scientists.


The fact that you think that "hey, let's work out a solution to fires together" means "we'll use a bucket brigade and obviously nothing else," is ridiculous. It's contrary to the fact that people have in fact implemented firefighting solutions other than bucket brigades, and even sometimes worked out how to pay for them without taxation. Your position is based on ignorance and flat rejection of reality.

First off, my post doesn't actually do much to describe policies that would fall within the realm of libertarianism. It largely only pointed out things that you claimed were libertarian aren't. So it seems hard to believe that anyone would see all the libertarian policies I described and think they require a big, powerful agency with lots of resources. I'm guessing that what you mean here is "I've heard libertarians describe how they'd implement their solutions to social ills and they seem like they'd require something big and powerful with more resources than they could raise voluntarily."
Well, fair enough. Your estimation of how much power and what resources they would require are presumably different from libertarians'. Feel free to make your arguments to that end or rebut libertarians' arguments about the level of power and resources required.


I can direct you to books on that topic, if you like. There's a new one coming out that looks at many historical examples of legal systems: "Legal Systems Very Different From Our Own." The author has some ideas about workable legal systems for a libertarian society.


I can direct you to some works on environmentalism in a libertarian society too.


Yes, libertarians believe that there's some way of addressing any given social ill that's compatible with libertarianism and which requires only resources and authority that can be legitimately raised, or gathering more resources and authority leads to a worse social ill. This is of course entirely reasonable and consistent. Any system that addresses some problem without regard for the cost probably isn't a good one.
So the criticism you might have here is only that you don't agree with libertarians on the right balance and you're willing to try to solve problems by doing things that libertarians see as worse than the problems. That's fine, that's a typical political disagreement that doesn't make libertarianism any different from any other political approach.


Yes, that's the libertarian position, that this can be done without taxation.


That's not a claim I made. You claimed that one problem they present is stealing to feed their habit and I showed how making drugs illegal actually worsens that problem. The fact that your solution to that problem makes that problem worse does not imply that that's the only problem.


No, this is only your strawman. As already covered, these are problems but ones which libertarians think can be addressed with voluntarily gathered resources and without violating anyone's property rights.


Again, this is just your strawman. Feel free to present an argument addressing what I actually said. Of course drug users lose "job/homes/etc." other ways than just incapacity, and that's not directly because of the drugs but because the drugs are criminalized. So if you're concerned about people losing jobs/homes/etc that's just another dimension on which to oppose drug criminalization.


If I were as ridiculous as you're being I would now accuse you of believing that Oxycontin is the only drug, or the only drug that has ever caused addiction or any problems.


You implied that the libertarian policy on drugs, which is to roll back all the harmful policies we have, would result in more harm. Explaining the harms caused by those policies is necessary to show that the harms caused by drug usage itself is less than the harms caused by the anti-drug policies.
So really I was interpreting your position as "government needs to exist so that not only addicts, but people who otherwise can support themselves, contribute, take care of their kids, etc. get locked up." Now if you really only mean "libertarian drug policy would be worse than some ideal policy I dreamed up for governments to implement which I haven't specified," fine. Still, it doesn't seem like there's any good reason to oppose rolling back all these harmful policies that you apparently also agree shouldn't exist. Even if nothing else was done, that rollback would be hugely beneficial for society, because those policies really are that harmful. Then of course there are libertarian ways of working on the social ills caused by drugs like children of addicts in bad situations, etc.


The policy under discussion was not lower taxes, business regulations or the size of government in general. It was your implication that having drugs legal is an undesirable policy. Drugs should be legal because the social harms of criminalizing them are far, far greater than all the social ills caused by drugs put together. Once it's clear that the harm of criminalizing drugs makes such a policy entirely untenable, then alternative solutions to solving the social ills caused by drugs can be advanced.




Yes, there are variations from libertarian to libertarian. That's not actually any different from any other political ideology. I see plenty of variation between supporters of socialism or democracy or whatever. Some libertarians might even be wrong while other libertarians are right.


This is just an assertion. In reality many libertarians believe what they believe for many reasons, from having experiences of things working out or working poorly or studying history and extrapolating, from thinking through arguments and coming up with conclusions, or indeed from intuition and values.


And this is nonsense. There are some libertarians who hold that 'selfishness is a virtue' but even they are talking about a qualified "enlightened" self interest. If this is really what you think is libertarianism's fatal flaw then things are looking pretty good for libertarianism. Here's a debate on [selfishness as a virtue][1] between libertarians (and as usual Gene Epstein has the correct position.)

Yes, π is suspected of being a [normal number][1]. It's not a matter of π merely being irrational. (Though a normal number must also be irrational.)

You did say "the other poster is correct," so unless you were talking about a different poster I thing it's fair to attribute his view to you. If your original reply to me wasn't a criticism of my critique of that other post then I don't see what the point of it was. You'd just be agreeing with me that pi is believed to be a normal number? Also, I never said there was anything special about pi; Pi is merely the particular number being discussed.
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:19:03
e and √2 are also thought to be normal. But there are irrational numbers known not to be normal, such as the one shown: 0.10100100010000... So it's not merely being irrational.
The property π has (and e and √2 have) that distinguishes it from numbers known not to be normal is that it appears to be 'truly' random, passing statistical tests as far as we can do them, and so forth. It's also been shown that normal numbers are far more common than non-normal numbers so a randomly selected real number would most likely be normal.

Are you aware that in reality when you take out a loan you don't actually get it in the form of cash? You get it in an account at that bank, and you can draw on it the same way as you draw on any other account: debit cards, and checks mostly. In practice very little money is handled as cash.


Deposits are quite useful. Money does not need to be cash to be useful.


Since they are both effectively the same there's no choosing between them. If you're interested, I link [elsewhere][1] in this discussion to a paper published by the Bank of England that goes more in depth on money creation and the real process that is somewhat more complicated than we've been discussing.

So there's no common misconception that being irrational means the number contains all possible sequences, including infinite sequences. Those are the claims I objected to. Whether normality is an interesting property is irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:33:14
I never said you said "all irrational numbers are normal." It's good that you didn't say that, because it's false.
But "the only reason people suspect pi is normal is that it is irrational" is false, and correcting that notion is my point for posting. No, pi being irrational is not "the only reason." If it were "the only reason" then logically, people would suspect all irrational numbers of being normal, which is not the case. This is not a technicality.
Furthermore "and also we have no reason to suspect it's not" is not sufficient either. Take a number 'x' that is irrational and about which you have no other information; You don't have any reason to suspect it's not a normal number, but that does not mean that you should suspect it of being normal. Pi is suspected of being normal for reasons beyond a mere lack of information about it.

The whole point of cash reserves is that enough cash is on hand to cover what the bank expects to be used in cash. Both models are still the same in that the whole $1000 are used for that (and the %10 reserve ratio is supposed to be set to be adequate to handle the actual usage of cash.)

There's a recently published book written by an economist and titled:
_The Case against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money_


I think that's really the wrong way to look at things. If a different person were in there doing the same things, would the results be that different? If not then in what sense is the problem the person rather than the things being done?
So often people are so certain that if the right person were in charge then things would be okay, because they'd do a better job of implementing whatever policy. But in reality sometimes it doesn't matter who's implementing a policy because the policy is just bad, or unworkable, or whatever. It doesn't matter who the central planner of an economy is, because centrally planning an economy cannot work well for fundamental reasons.

One major form of conflict is people predating on one another rather than having to cooperate if they want something from another person. Ending violence and coercion based on being able to physically take certain things from people seems like it it would reduce conflict, and so these seem to be the same thing to me.
So what kind of stabilization were you thinking of? And why does what you're thinking of rely on the technology being 'used wisely' when the technology is pretty explicitly intended to be uncontrollable by any single vision as to what is 'wise' (e.g., a state's vision about how to wisely manage a monetary system)?
When you say 'accumulate and protect wealth' it calls to mind opponents of private property who think that advocates for private property just want to pile up worthless stuff and sit on it; Like people don't actually do anything with 'wealth' and that money has no social function. To give you an idea of how the phrase sounds to me, I'm imagining someone with a view of a market, aghast at the people who are, in the observer's mind, 'accumulating and protecting food'.
