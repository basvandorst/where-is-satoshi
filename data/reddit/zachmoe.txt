I also am a big fan of USD.  OP in this instance is right.
The current world order, though it has it's bugs and features, is not inherently malevolent.  More people are not living in poverty than ever before, and those that are have a much higher standard of living than ever before.  
The fact you specifically even have the privilege to purchase potentially frivolous cryptocurrency today is nothing but a testament to the success of fiat currency and the fruits of modern money mechanics.
Most people are debtors, why would you not want your debts to get fundamentally less expensive just by holding it in inflationary fiat currencies.

It isn't a lack of empathy being against shitty policy, look at  no-fault auto insurance rates in Michigan, everyone just ends up getting fucked then into paying ever increasing insurance premiums and those that cannot afford it end up without it anyway (50% of drivers in Detroit do not have auto insurance) now causing it to get more expensive for everyone else and on and on with this run away effect (similar to the 08-09 adjustable rate mortgage crisis).  There has to be a dynamic solution that our politicians haven't thought of yet, where both those who need care get it at a fair price, and where those who don't extract much care aren't compulsory paying for everyone else's shortfall, maybe the solution actually lies in a sort of public-private entity.
Unfortunately the way it is now, everyone is fucked by applying the Michigan auto insurance model to health care through law, especially the  sick working poor, which is why it unconscionable that people ever supported ACA.  It was so obviously written by the insurance companies, and will be the source of the next major economic downturn as premiums continue to rise and more people are priced out but are forced to pay or be fined (thanks Obama) and are squeezed (only this time it will be everyone squeezed, not just those who choose to buy houses).
Medicare and Medicaid already existed.

Where isn't his risk?  Like I said, there is both risk the loan could not get paid back and the risk of whatever currency the debt is in.
There are risks actually in owning a business (in real life) like a bank or credit union and having and paying employees that you also just ignore.
The lender created the money but the money that was created is actually very valuable and needs it back, and if you lose enough of it and run your business poorly, you go out of fucking business and lose everything.
The converse however is that lending and credit instantaneously break down, because there is neither incentive nor benefit to lending something volatile and theoretically deflationary like bitcoin at 0% interest like you suggest, which you also just ignore.
Where is the borrowers risk in an inflationary environment?  The debt is getting fundamentally cheaper over time theoretically were it not for the nominal amount of interest being accrued.  Where conversely the debt would get fundamentally impossibly more expensive over time for the borrower who would now be a literal actual slave, which also further disincentives borrowing in totality because no one would even ask.

You clearly have questionable ideas about supply and demand.  You realize the dairy producers don't communicate with other dairy producers and produce more dairy than any population could reasonably consume, and the small time dairy producers are going out of business because of this lack of communication?

This person doesn't understand business or economics, as long as they can sell the bitcoins for something, it is still better to keep going than to not unfortunately.
A classic example, If you have to pay $350 a month for a mortgage, and you can only find a renter for $300 a month, you suck up the $50 a month loss because the alternative is paying the whole $350 a month.

Because the Government is unable to sell equity in itself (to my knowledge), they traditionally sell bonds to raise capital.  When the government runs out of things to buy, or subsidize, and investors no longer need safe returns for retirement, they will stop issuing bonds.  Why would you stop issuing bonds altogether when you have to pay less interest on your debt than anyone else and people will still buy them?  We benefit when people invest in bonds, because the government gets to use the capital raised by it today, you could argue the capital raised is misallocated, but to argue that Debt itself is this terrible thing is alarmism at it's finest; especially in a country that has a GDP that would make its debt blush, it is clear you do not know what you're talking about.


Only if politicians choose to, it is unlikely.


There is a value of the work of whatever economist/politician who patched the idea together.

It doesn't "need" to be.


It isn't, there is usually an element of work involved.  If you take out a loan from a bank, you better believe there is interest that you need to pay back, probably through labor, governments being an organization that can collect taxes have... other means, as well also have assets that can appreciate faster than the debt grows.


It is not likely we would ever see 20% interest rates because of two things, demand, and perceived risk.  Demand drives down return on yield on bonds for obvious reasons.  Right now, US treasuries are understood to be "risk free", you can expect very little capital return in exchange for a low risk instrument (these Bonds are the same "debt" that you have such a problem with).
