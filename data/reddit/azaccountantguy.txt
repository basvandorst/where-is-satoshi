Once people realize btc is a useless currency, it will tank. I don't quite understand why people are treating bitcoin as stock, it's far from it.

Bitcoin owners are so ignorant, they see the 10k and think they hit a gold mine, it'll crash, and crash hard. Meanwhile, I'll be sitting here with my 367 shares of Amazon stock sitting pretty knowing I have years of lucrative investment ahead ��

I’m hoping to see some $8300 support, would be nice to see. Btc is getting some traction post $8k which is nice, everyone needs to remain patient. investing isn’t an overnight thing.

I love seeing people falter at the smallest drop lol, that’s how investing works. Even the best, most profitable stocks have drops too. Don’t invest if you can’t fathom having drops.

Lets hit that 8300 mark today. gotta muster through this resilience tho

As someone who invested 30k when it was 3.4k, bitcoin has no "real" reason to go up in price. I see people on here saying it'll hit 20k+ the likelihood of that happening is very very low. Bitcoin doesn't have a "CEO" bitcoin doesn't produce anything that will make it go up. I'd be surprised to see 10k anytime soon. People on here advocate to invest into BTC but if you're only gonna invest $100, you're better off investing into stocks instead, your ROI will be much higher. at the current moment if you invested $100 it'd have to hit 16k just to double your money. Investing $100 into BTC at this price is just silly. This might seem weird coming from someone who has invested 30k, but invested 30k at 3.4k. I honestly might pull it out soon too, I don't see btc increasing all that much from here. People on here just spew bullshit for the sake of it so people will be convinced into buying it.
I know I'll get downvoted but everyone on Reddit is 'Bullish' on bitcoin, it's common when it comes to stocks/investing but being realistic is the only way you actually make money. You see people thinking btc will spike to 50k+ when the 'halving' happens, no, it won't lol. There's absolutely no reason for widespread adoption in the USA for bitcoin, literally none - Our currency is stable and we do not need anymore ways to 'pay' for things. It becomes an over abundance of ways to spend money, it's overwhelming for the regular human being. As of right now, the way you pay for things with btc is over complicated, the process is not simple and not intuitive. The only reason btc has even gone up is FOMO, no actual reason for btc to rise in price.

You can buy and sell man lol. They aren’t keeping your money... If you can’t verify your ID just email them, if it doesn’t work oh well you can still cash out your btc and withdraw to a bank acc
