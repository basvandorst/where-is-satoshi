I think too many assume they know manpower hours for the nsa or other and think something is unviable, but forget the advancement of computational power. Years ago it was prohibitive to track a large number of individuals around the city 24/7.so the nsa had to put forth a certain amount of man hours to do so. Today tracking 1000 unsuspecting individuals is easy and can be done with little manpower. It's not safe to assume once manpower resource intensive tasks always remain costly. I am no expert but if I was a director, I would have at least one team of people whose sole job would be to find ways to cut manpower expense so I could use people else where. Cutting all the conspiracy crap it is just something that makes sense

If the secretary of defense said that you most likely had weapons of mass destruction in your house or you knew where they were. Just because you shared a name with an individual. Do you think your life would continue on the same as it had the day before? If yes then keep on dreaming, if no then that's where this is at. Her irresponsibility and shitty journalism is putting his life at risk. that's the point. Just because I can say something doesn't mean I should be able to put your life at risk for no reason what so ever.
Thats the difference.

I agree, reddit and 4chan were wrong to finger that guy. But lets take out all the extra stuff cluttering story and boil it down to this.
If I worked for a print and I highly publicized that you had a billion dollars in your house(which you don't). and tons of people read it. would it cause you trouble? would there be stalkers, IRS investigations etc because of that allegation? do you think there are nut jobs out there that would try to exploit you for the money? and since you don't have any large sums of money, how do you protect yourself?

I don't advocate real trust in any pool.


I think I understand just a hair more than the average user so here goes.
do worry about that scenario you would need the following:
1. all 3 of those mining pool operators would need to be willing to disrupt normal operations for the chance to gain a bit more profit for a short period of time.
2. when word gets out they are the cause of a hard fork, they would have to keep all their independent miners with them. 
not all miners would want to be apart of why bitcoin crashed really hard, thus making their own investments worth less
So when some miners flee their hashrate will go down, jepordizing their malicious work.
3. in response you might see a bit of temporary consolidation all the independants and small guilds temporarily joining a medium sized pool. more join and the new malicious chain is now abandoned as more and more jump ship from the sinking boat.
at that point the pool's name has been shamed, the operator's reputation will be smashed. 
So realistically even though they have the raw power to come together to fork the chain, their actual power comes from the miners who are working for them and who would view such a project as a major liability. 
The pool operators have to consider the human factor here. 
That's the detailed explanation I was talking about/thinking about.

I agree that the other 200 devices are then intelligent, I would also on this point, like to point out that because physically, there is no perfectly identical hardware due to variation, that over time those 200 devices even if given the same tasks will start to variate from one another.
I think "intelligence" at least on par with our intelligence benchmark, is not so much a single tangible thing but very abstract. an example would be a perfect circle. I can make objects that were not perfect circles into perfect circles. but no one "created" or "invented" the perfect circle, its an abstract that is almost statistically 100% has been used elseware by other intelligent biological beings somewhere in our universe.
In the purest sense, only the electrons actually move with electricity/power. when you copy something digitally you have 1s and 0s on the storage medium and all that is done is it gets switched to the same pattern as what you are copying.
So in actuality, i would say intelligence isnt in the strictest since 'conveyed' its an abstract idea that we can impose on different materials/objects.
whew i hope that was clear enough. its a tough subject to really understand. and honestly the big questions really come into play when you consider that our level of intelligence may not be that far up there in terms of scale. its kind of easy to imagine down, but its hard to imagine up.

Well, ok. from my understanding a new version of the client came out. the new blocks that were being produced due to a bug in the code were not able to be processed by the older clients. They didn't choose a chain based on who was behind or not, but choose it based on whether the majority could continue to participate. It does not make any kind of sense, what so ever, to in (example here) version 1.0 have everything stable, then in version 2 introduce or have something that is backwards compatible. you need to transition: 1.4 introduces the feature but not activated or not required to run. run through versions  1.5 1.6 and 1.8 with this in the background so that once 80% + have the feature installed then turn it on by default. 
What happened in april was a bug in the newer version of the miner that aparently snuck up even after trying to test all they could.


I susbscribe to "anything is possible" as well, but these people running the pools are in it for profit. and I stand by they wont mess with their profits.


ah well i think that falls down to the level of caring. when pools reach 50%~ and as far as anyone can tell nothing malicious is going on then the push to dispurse them will be more relaxed. if a pool is near 50%, and starts acting to the detriment of the network, then you would see a much more active backlash, people phoning other operators, devs waking up and contacting other pools. then you have my original plan start to take place, where a percentage of the pool starts to break away, then once the other pools pick up the slack that chain will be dropped. no miner wants to be stuck working on a chain thats going to implode and become worthless.

coinbase i believe keeps some in cold storage, and some available for spending. such that if they had 1000 coins but daily they only need to use about 200, 700 coins would remain in cold storage leaving 300 to be sent and received for daily use. you will never see this as they handle it behind the scenes. unless you put in like 500 coins, and then decide to take 500 out a month later your amounts you send and receive wont hit the limits they set.

I have always been of the belief that adding in more past the 8 decimal places is very close to just adding in more coins. Same principle different take. roughly-  Like if you take 21 million coins, each coin can be broken down into 99,999,999 x 21 million coins gives you - 2,099,999,979,000,000 satoshis. Total. adding more decimal places changes that number considerably.. and isnt that just the same(with different number figures) of adding in more coins? I understand that either way it either increases the value per coin or decreases(rate wise) if you add more coins the price per coin either slows/drops, if you add more decimals each coin becomes worth more(eventually).

@_date: 2013-04-01 14:26:07
I am not sure what you did there lol... the private key is base58 the shamir's secret key doesnt care about that at all. it does it all automatically from the input. unless you actually researched how shamirs works and then thats what you are talking about.. ? in that case hats off to you but perhaps there is a reason? even if i was able to understand the algorithm and change it and it still function I would be leery of changing a well known tested algorithm in anyway. you could be lessening the security by not strictly following the path laid out by the algorithm.
or you could simply share the initial secret hash that bitcoin uses to create the address.. thats a sha256 hash of the ECDSA or sha256 of the brainwallet word. you could share just that but I see little difference if the shamirs secret is already defined and correctly converting everything anyways.

the only actual value gold has is in the conductor business. its a great conductor for parts but other than that nothing. and at the moment gold is a decent store of value. but there are plans to go into space and mine asteroids, those rocks contain hundreds of billions of dollars worth of gold and silver and when we do get there to mine, gold prices will drop. like you said its unlikely a new bitcoin will come out. people want stability as well as profit.
Also take for example. say you think of a new feature so amazing that it can challenge bitcoin. in order to get any kind of potential backing you must give everyone the ability to review the code. all it takes is a consensus of a majority of developers to review the new feature and implement it into bitcoin. if its so adventitious, and such a leap forward its doubtful anyone would hang onto the older version. so in that way anything newer that comes along bitcoin can assimilate the properties of WHILE people get to keep the value they have in coins they have already. Only those with no money in bitcoin, and a desire to strictly reap profits would desire a switch to a whole different currency like that. 
thats why a competing crypto currency wont really have a chance against bitcoin. people will want to keep the value of bitcoin up and bitcoin itself can evolve whatever feature the other currency has, if its that important and groundbreaking. Dont you think?

perhaps its because apple's motto is or was "think different" and that's the mantra they talk about, then create their walled gardens strictly according to their whims while still playing the part of inviting innovation and ideas. What about the apps that were added by independent developers that apple liked so much they included their own versions? IIRC Sirius was one of those. Doubt whoever made it got money from it or even remotely what it deserved.
Apple is like the two faced pretty girl liar to me. I will never own an apple product on principle, and mostly I like having some semblance of choice.

dont want to inflate the currency chain, just change some things create a new chain for voting, issue private keys to everyone via small cards that require social as the pin number. have the county or state sign each persons key to make it valid and usable in the election. all types of stuff you can do at that point. instantly detect double voting issuing an alarm, filter out votes that have not been signed by the state as authorized. you personally could keep track of what you voted for and who. lost cards could be revoked/not accepted.

1. Doesnt matter if they implement it first. Infact thats a good thing as it provides proof of concept that it functions.
2. Depends on what feature they add. Can you see anyone resisting an upgrade if it adds a way for additional anonymity, or even further cryptographic protection?
3. just like litecoin or some of the others there is no real point to them can you think of a niche any niche where bitcoin cant do as well or better than a competing online cryptocurrency?
4. is based on IF another one gains any kind of momentum which is unlikely. We have a billion dollars worth of purchasing power in bitcoin right now people won't want to change over. except in the case where a fatal, unrecoverable flaw is discovered. not talking about breaking aes or anything like a flaw that allows spending of others coins. or an influx of new coins. but the majority here wins they would abandon that fork and the only ones out are the ones who are trying to manipulate the system for strictly their own game.
example if in .8.5 release I find a way to spend others bitcoins and I start doing it people will notice posts will be made and it will be looked into. when, not if, but when the problem is found and it will be found quickly, incentive here, it will either be patched or downgraded to 8.4 whichever is quicker, the miners will be notified that their blocks will be no longer accepted due to security breach and they will switch. at most a loss of several blocks a few thousand will occur and then what? the only people who would want to keep the system as is are the ones exploiting... then their fork chain is worthless. you could steal a bunch one time off perhaps. from a large address and it might not be recoverable and the price might drop for a bit at the uncertainty but it will be fixed.

no one you have the private key you are good. there are many sites that translate/convert strings of text into the long complicated formula that eventually produces a bitcoin private key.
passguardian.com might be an issue if it goes away as you need the site to reconstruct whatever you put into it. BUT how they do it the structure is called sharims secret sharing i believe and its a well known math algorithm which you could find all over the net or do it yourself if you are inclined. if passguardian went down you could just search up others online that can reconstruct it. all passguardian does is bundle it neatly into a nice interface/webpage thats all.

you dont need any kind of fees, since it will be done by the government and they pay for that stuff anyways. the more nodes out there doing it the better. so nodes held by each political party(that they can check if they wish) signature the entire software so no changes are made. give em to independent contractors, hell even keep it on a few foreign military bases around the world(our bases located overseas) as additional backup/hashing power. at the end of each election when all votes are in you can freeze the chain at a certain time, accepting no more votes and then put up the votechain(just thought of it) on public facing websites for the public to scrutinize and for transparency.

ok so you are telling me there is no difference between
.0000001 satoshi for a 1cent which equals a max of 999,999 per coin, 
.000000000001 satoshi(or whatever) per 1cent which equals a max of 999,999,999,999USD
so for now the max a coin can be if pegged to 1 cent is 1 million per coin, I can definitely see the difference between that and 1 trillion per coin. 
So to have a 1 trillion dollar coin we would need to change it to be .00000000001 system instead. 
You still have 21million coins but at 1 cent in the former example you reach 21trillion dollars if you peg the least significant amount possible in both currencies.
in the later example you can reach 21,000,000,000,000,000,000 Quintilian dollars.
both examples are of course maximum adoption and if it was used to replace all currency everywhere. I understand that if it takes less market amount you will still see 1cent = .000034320000000no matter how many zeros you put behind it.

if you are talking about having the same wallet on multiple PCs, you can easily monitor funds that way. but because after each transaction the change is sent to a newly generated address, that address would not be available on that other computer. Best bet is to use an online wallet like blockchains if you want to have multiple computers able to use the bitcoin. otherwise you risk the wallets becoming out of sync whenever a purchase is made.
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:36:10

Me making money, when simultaneously other individuals using them for scams, drugs, and child porn just cant be connected. they bear no relationship to each other.


Indeed its not perfect, I would be happy to pay for new roads to be built, for good police officers to get paid and for (the few that are out there) politicians to get paid to properly represent their people. The system as it is right now for tax purposes is a mess. 60 percent of those filing taxes have to pay someone to do it for them for fear of making a mistake, congress has made 5,000 changes to the law in 1 year. even people who want to follow the tax law can make errors either paying too much or too little risking more penalties. and those who can afford it, hire real tax experts, not bob from down the street moonlighting as a tax expert, to find loopholes for them to reduce the amount of their 'invoice'. 
I wouldn't bitch or gripe if we had finer tuned methods of controlling where our taxes went to and what. hell something as simple as a bitcoin address for each section, address for military, foreign aid, domestic improvement, etc. that would be ten times better in my opinion.
getting back off that slight rant, what we need to understand is what a tax is, and what a lawful tax is. taxing for the sake of running our governments and improvement at home is a simplistic approach making a very complex issue seam trivial to consider. truth is the tax as a whole is very complicated and is incredibly backwards.
when millionaires and billionaires, and billion dollar corporations pay the tax liability they realistically owe to be rightful contributors instead of sucking the money out of the country then i would consider it fair to go after my bitcoin profits. 
do I think that bitcoin should fall under something regarding tax? sure why not, all other points aside but only if all the elite/corps get their tax shelters taken too.

try passguardian.com. break the private key up into like 3 pieces and give one to your wife and the other 2 to trusted friends in different circles that wont likely meet. that way should something happen to you your wife and take her piece to either friends and retrieve their piece and get the bitcoins back. You can scale it up to what your comfortable with 5 pieces 3 required to rebuilt the private key. you can also let your friends know not to give up that paper unless something has happened to you.

your right. Actually i just had my coins from coinbase confirmed and it sent. the issue was coinad inadvertantly sent a transaction that did not have enough fees in it to get processes normally. and due to a bug in coinbases site, it used that unconfirmed transaction as an input to fund other transactions... again and again and again. and in the end 655 transactions were held up due to that one transaction. I traced mine all the way back, and since I got mine others should be getting their transactions done as well.

Perhaps if (for those so inclined) could allocate where their taxes are being spent. taxes for roads check, long-term scientific projects check, medical cancer research check. But dont cherry pick it. I dont want to pay for the huge budget of the cia/nsa. Dont want to pay for the "pet projects" that the greedy politicians put in play. meh perhaps it would be cool if the government had public addresses/public key addresses for each section/subsection and say you were told you needed to pay 2,000 in taxes. you could either dump it into the overall address, or dump it in particulars  just so long as you paid your 2,000.

how does dividing it not make it less scarce? for example, if i have a single 5 foot plank of wood(bare with me here), its a single piece. just one I give to just 1 person. If i divide it into 5 pieces what was once scarce, is now less so. 5 people own pieces of it? perhaps I do not understand

mtgox does have a hand in it. kinda like the federal reserve doing something.. plainly, and irrefutably stupid. and I dont mean just a difference in opinion on how something should work. I do advocate the use of bitcoins and I am on it for the long term. with that being said there needs to be a hell of a lot more people using it, for these wild swings to not be so wild anymore. I thought about the price at 250,-260 and i wondered if i should transfer, i didnt and i only feel alittle bad. not because I could not abandon a failed technology and reap a bit of money, but because i could have re-bought in at the lower 120 and gained more profit. everyone is in this for profit. either in btc or usd. and if anyone claims otherwise they are lying. it just varies on which is the priority, getting the money away from the bankers, simple purchasing power profit in whatever currency or whatever.  besides when someone believes in something enough, no risk or downside will turn them away.

i understand the idea of security. but seriously, how paranoid can you realistically be. *stop* ok, lets make a new offline wallet. you need to buy a new laptop randomly from bestbuy, never hook it up to the internet. then download a copy of bitaddress.org and truecrypt onto a CD. run it and create your address. then you must save the private key, in a 1mb container on truecrypt and burn it to another CD. THEN you need to burn the computers ram sticks (cause you booted from a live image not the hard drives) only then will you have the ultra-secure-top-top-secret private key thats nearly impossible to get to. after that you take the password that you used in the truecrypt container, and you encrypt that with your gpg key. Finally you tatoo your 20 digit gpg key to the underside of your forearm so you dont forget.
BAM complete security.
ps remember to tatoo the password in ceasers cipher so even if someone snapped a pic they would not be able to decrypt the gpg file that houses the truecrypt file, or decrypt the truecrypt file that has been tripple encoded AES-SERPENT-TWOFISHed, and then reach the private key and KNOW its a bitcoin private key. There EASY!
there is no such thing as too paranoid.

the difference between 1 address to hold all the coins and 1,000 addresses to hold the coins and the likely hood of someone guessing the private key.. is for all intents and purposes the same. you would need hundreds of billions of addresses for the percent of a collision to occur even noticeably move.

inability to regulate or inflate. The largest factor I think in my mind is their inability to take the money away. Say I get accused of a crime and I have 2 million dollars in a brain wallet. what can they do? they could say that its mine by tying in past transactions. But without the key they wont be able to take my funds away from me. so what I go to jail get a fine slapped on me for a while and then? back out and access to my money. anything that is high visibility and puts the government in a position to where they can't do anything period is bad for their reputation. for the longest time people have held the belief that the government can do anything to its citizens and even non-citizens and this is honestly the only example where brute force(torture aside) will not work. absolutely. without bitcoin I could try and hide my money somewhere but it could be found by others or the government. I could try to move it cross borders but its likely that i would get caught in a sting operation and they would take the money from me by gunpoint.
Ill be honest I have this wild idea of making my fortune (not just by bitcoins, but by moving a portion of my paycheck each month into bitcoins) and having it in bitcoins and when I have enough to retire/move away just picking up ship and leaving. No forms no taxes, no  "you cant take 800,000" dollars with you never to return" type deal.

I disagree, if for example I stored my coins on address 1, say i store 2,000BTC and I know that I will keep it there for a while I could sign a message "I am UlyssesSKrunk, (real name of course) with social sec number(if applicable) and drivers license  app) and I certify these coins are mine. Sign the message print and keep with your records. Of course it will not work if they are transferred out for the reasons you mention. Also you would have to think ahead of time to make the message first. It prevents you from honestly losing your funds at that address due to computer failure or other issue where you no longer have the private key. Now you could also just brain wallet it to that address, claim loss of key, and after the record becomes inadmissible recover the keys using the password. But that's what? 7 years or so.
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:39:18
the fact that its hard coded. if someone wanted to change it to generate more than 21m, it would decrease the value of each coin which no one wants to happen. and you would need to convince more than 12.5 thousand nodes to switch to the new software. then there would be a fork in the chain. and who really wants their coins to depreciate?

they mainly avoid promoting the SR approach because of its illegal activities will just give more ammo to the people who want to shut it down. the point should be made that it can be used in practically any situation just like cash. pointing out (what evidence do you have that a majority of the transactions are SR?) the illegal activities of this will deter many who dont want to be associated, even if its illogical with that kind of publicity.

the further out you go, 20-50 and more the fuzzier things become. the op wanted 5 years fast forward. The bankers and other interested parties can definitely spend their money however they wish. but spending billions to lobby, in such a short time frame will definitely be noticed and I don't think they can afford unpredictable levels of public exposure. What if by virtue of them spending billions in a few short years it draws the average person's attention to bitcoin and they realize what a great system it is? I say they would be more cautious and have to take it slower.

@_date: 2013-04-09 12:00:40
Interesting. If you made it known that you would be using the service in advance then the other individual might not have bothered with going to the trouble of going to the place of transaction. if it was sprung on him in the course of the transaction then the other dude could just walk away to be a dick even knowing it wont get the money. depends on what kind of escrow you are talking about. there are systems that have a 3rd party, and systems that have no third party and its basically both sides have to consent(to the mechanism) for the money to be released.

I am not sure you are going to get too many legitimate bites on this one. If they can produce a verifiable signature for an address that has over a million in bitcoins, and they post they are just setting themselves up for the IRS if they are based in the US to investigate them. This is of course if they have not paid any kind of taxes on it. also like I said about the signature, assume they are trolls unless they sign it with a key that has had a million dollars in it. or still does.

a brain wallet is even better. but dont use a single passWORD. use a phrase thats meaningful to you. or some others have suggested using username:password, however you want to do it to create the private key. I like the idea of the username:password deal because its an easy to remember format, its not a single word which can be brute forced even with wordlists and rules (cause they are not looking for that, they are just looking for single words, ie passwords).

@_date: 2013-02-25 15:53:26
true, if the NSA, or any of the other alphabet agency decided to go all out then we would have a problem. One reason I find their involvement reasonably unlikely, is they have no solid reason to interfere. If btc was being used for strictly terrorism/illegal activities, or directly used to hurt USA financial interests(as a whole) then yea maybe they could have the justification. but when you are talking about 20+ TH computing, either via a small network of really powerful computers or many clusters you run into a operating cost. the agencies listed do not have to divulge their budget and resource allocation to the outside public or even congress but someone, somewhere, who does do the paperwork will notice the spike in funds being spent to power the attack and it will be his/her job to flag that spike for internal review. thats assuming the attack took off to begin with. bitcoin doesnt directly hurt the us economy and isnt a direct threat to the USA as a whole so those agencies will likely invest their time on a 51% attack. They may run their own nodes, they may spend money on studies seeing where they can use bitcoins in their various operations sure. I can see that going on just fine and inline with their mission. But those agencies deal in threats, physical, cyber, exterior and interior to the USA, and they cant be lobbied, or really swayed by money grubbing paypal or VISA which is where most of the pressure would be coming from. contrary to popular belief (1) their funding isnt unlimited. (2) they are not omnipresent, their data collection and sifting abilities are impressive, very very impressive, but it falls back to money. (3) the usa government is very fragmented, tend to sue themselves, or at least one section is constantly suing some other section, the nsa isnt likely to give up information to the NRO, and the cia isnt likely to share information with the fbi/nro/nsa. doing so will violate their most precious law, that if hoarding information and letting as little as possible out. they would have to SHARE information in order to work together and thats a no no. 
bitcoins only practical/likely threat is the open government legislation against it, backed by visa/paypal etc through congress. 
And lastly congress can act like it gives the nsa orders but the nsa is buried under so many clauses and need to know bs, that whenever congress does have a hearing or whenever they try to get information from them its like pulling teeth. 
Though I can see an exchange perhaps. visa lobbies certain senators who have budget pull over the agencies, in return the agencies perform the attack in return for larger budgets. but you run the risk of accusations of visa hiring/influencing the nsa/cia and the public fallout from that, that a public company can make a top secret government agencies dance to its whims.
 
edit - TL;DR = no real incentive for the agencies to meddle with bitcoin, no way for companies/senators to strong arm them either into an attack.

I dont see USD deflating because of btc. example - regardless if btc existed or not, or the price of btc to USD, the amount of USD it takes to purchase bread/milk water will still do what they have always done. So as the price of BTC to dollar continues to get wider, the price for a loaf of bread will remain 3USD(plus whatever the inflation is of course)
your purchasing power in btc will increase, but your purchasing power in USD will not decrease due to btc.  
Hope that makes more sense lol.

they most likely dont have the bitcoins available is why. demand is so high right now that they need to physically have the coins on hand before they can sell them to you and they simply dont have it. all you have to do to move the coins from coinbase to an offline wallet is generate an paper wallet from bitaddress.org print it out, and then transfer your coins to one of the addresses on the paper. If you want to be super secret security minded, generate 5 or so addresses and break up the amount you have to go into all of the addresses. you can also generate the addresses from the site after you disconnect your internet. some people are paranoid about the coding sending the private keys back to the author of the site.

depends on what you use for your wallet. blockchains online wallet sends you backup copies all the time (in the settings you can set this). if you use electrum there is a set of seed words. these words can be used to recreate and restore your entire wallet, 1 backup works forever. armory wallet its a option to backup either to the hard drive or paper.

unconfirmed transactions they appear almost immediately, the confirmations in the block chain take a while longer. but for anything less than 30 bucks i would be fine with zero confirm time. 100+ though and you need 1+2 perhaps imo. more money the more transactions you need. so if I was selling something for say 6 million dollars, i would wait to complete the transaction at least until 10 confirms.

yes, but as its also been pointed out that that it would require a hardfork. and the community as a whole is very adverse to hardforks. besides divisibility IS going to be a factor. Changing the number of decibel places a coin can be divided into is just the same as changing the 21 million coin hard limit. right now, there are (at an even 21million, yes i know its not exactly but it shows my point) 20,999,999,790,000 divisible units or satoshi. changing it is just akin to adding more currency in don't you agree? and that undermines the scarceness of each unit.

or something like 10 independent contractors run nodes, with nodes in control of republican and democrat parties. or hell even every major party paying the cost of having their node. the private keys issued don't need to be logged down anywhere, just sign the keys with a key held only for that jurisdiction and each jurisdiction is signed by each state. that way you cant have multiple keys/voting. give everyone a card that swipes that requires your social as a pin. good idea?

they most likely don't understand how bitcoin functions. or at best have a superficial knowledge of it. I wouldn't recommend keeping any significant amount of coins in any wallet that another person runs, like blockchain or coinbase for any length of time. keep the majority of your coins on your computer and encrypted and use a cold wallet and a wallet you use on a day to day basis. Doing that yea its for all intents and purposes impractical to take your coins.

though its hard to justify transferring the purchasing power of your dollar to bitcoin when its price is rising so quickly. why should i spend 6.99 worth of bitcoins when tomorrow it will end up being 9.99 and i overpaid on an item? likewise some people have estimated the actual adopted resting price at something like 100,000. I think it will reach that, so why should i get rid of it to spend? large profits aside i want bitcoin to succeed regardless of the final coin to usd value. i think whatever the final price as long as its used widely that will be enough for me. the 100,000 per coin is just a bonus.

ok, and every time you try to send the money elsewhere from your wallet to somewhere else it says invalid signature, yea might be an issue with your private key, see if you cant extract the private key and then load it into armory or another client, if it is corrupt well there isnt much hope. you can try guessing a few of the characters but it would be fruitless, as others would tell you as well.

Your right they can innovate faster, but with something like currencies stability is also extremely important. innovate too fast and people will hold off investing/spending, appreciate to fast and the same thing with a possible bubble. I do think the currency is appreciating too quickly i would rather it slowly build up and be functional rather than a quick rise and shaky ground afterwards.

thats a very good idea. so if meeting first course of action would be to trade IDs and hold onto his while he holds yours. Barring one or either of you dont have IDs on you, take a picture/movie of the other individual. then once the transaction is complete then you can remove the picture, or give back the IDs. thats pretty good.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:00:13

@_date: 2013-02-25 20:54:19


No it wont either, at least as I understand it because what you are trading for that 100m, is not free, it took TIME to generate, electricity to generate, time to code the software.
it seems that you think that btc are being printed straight and completely out of thin air and that is not true there is a cost of time,electricity which is paid in usd, ala conversion to produce this shiny new bitcoin. its a conversion really, a trade.
to cut to the point it seems like the reply is fundamentally comparing what bitcoins are doing with what counterfeit is. (please correct me if i am not understanding correctly.)
Yes there are costs to producing counterfeit bills, but normally you sell the 100million for 20 million and its that that mucks everything up. counterfeits have 2 components, perceived value, and actual value. most often these 2 values are vasty disproportional. and its the inbalance that makes the dollar drop. 
100million in counterfeit = 1 millionish in sellable cash. its value is based on being fake and passing for USD
100 million in btc = whatever supply and demand is (3.04billion at the moment) worth based on market value and is not designed to be slipped into the pool of circulating money so that those that know its real value (1 million) are at an advantage vs those who dont know.
Great points btw really made me think!

what hardleft121 said plus this - backup that file often. simply this- the wallet generates address 111 and that address has (example) 10btc put on it. when you spend it somewhere all the funds from address 111 are moved/spent.  whatever you didn't spend on your purchase is moved to a new address like 222. your wallet.dat file will contain the addresses of all of these and thats how it works. if you use the same wallet.dat file for years on end and make alot of purchases its not unreasonable to think that the wallet.dat file will contain hundreds maybe thousands of addresses. if you never mess with anything and dont get creative and use the bitcoin client like a normal user, you will have hundreds or thousands of addresses that have nothing on them and just a few that have money in them. 
the reason why you will sometimes hear people tell you to backup the wallet file after every transaction is this: after every transaction the change is sent to a newly generated address that you own. if you use a old wallet.dat file from 6 months ago or even from a few purchases ago odds are overwhelmingly good that there is no money left in the addresses in the old wallet.dat file.
There are some wallets that are called deterministic wallets" 
what this means is that the wallet creates a certain key. and that single source key is used to generate all the other keys that the wallet will ever use. so even if you use a 6 month old wallet of that kind it will be able to figure out/generate the keys again for your coins.
Wallets that i know of that use deterministic are :Armory, electrum, and the blockchain.info wallet. there are most likely more but those are the ones off the top of my head. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:17:13
seriously dont be a dick. I always include fees, 4-8 cents. The new blockchain app doesnt let you put a fee in, and there is no option on the app to set the fee. It was the first time using it to transfer money off the address. so ill pay my damn fees, just dont assume everyone ELSE is a cheap asshole.
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:15:00
Those only show up after hours 
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:26:25
from the private keys, they sign the transaction, only signed transactions from that public address will be considered and only if according to the blockchain funds are available at that address. all others where the signature doesn't match(cryptographically) with the public address, or where funds are insufficient will be disregarded. once its included in a block, its pretty much there. the further down the road(more blocks get appended after that block) the more permanent that transaction becomes.

I have to disagree with the humans cannot be copied, vs machines.
Here is why:
there is a few IFs, but just because they are IFs doesnt invalidate the assumption/theory
example: 
I have john and he donated his brain to me. IF i could seperate the brain without damage and IF I could physically replicate his brain in its entirety, I could put both brains back into bodies, in this case the original body plus a newly cloned body and once they regained consciousness they would be identical, up until that instant where minute environmental factors start adding entropy specific to them, which would cause their memories to then diverge. 
to me this would be identical to just copying over the software onto identical hardware. The assumption that people are different from 'higher level robots' is just kind of false and hallow to me. we are no matter how we look at it biological computers.
I realize you cannot accurately compare Johnny 5 to the human mind. 
Those same differences people expect from people, their belief that there cannot be 2 identical individuals can also be true for machines.
Take 2 advanced identical/ same sha512 hash for our purposes here/ AI system software and place them into seemingly identical robot units. 
They will behave the same initially at least. just like the above humans would, but the variation in the chip timing, response that happens during the production of the body would eventually give them distinct differences even though they were supposed to be seemingly identical.
Same thing for a human so i fail to see where you think humans are so superior in that regard. of course we are superior to a hammer. But its very possible and very likely that we will see AI systems that we can no longer classify as "Artificial" and then they become known as Actual Intelligence.

So your saying that there is a computer out there that can randomly guess,  "I love my bitcoins and had a shitty day today, and I drive a cool Honda element and my name is Wanda." I know computers can guess random stuff to a certain point but come on it could never arrange and guess the words and structures of a unique statement in any reasonable time. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:25:02
perhaps. Though I think its more indicative of poor management. and greed. those at my level(im actually in the poor class at poverty level, well for the us at least) often think why they should be substantially burdened, when those who have way, way more never feel the effects of the taxes. a middle income family with 1 house, 2 working parents who have no huge investments, basically living even within their means feels the tax crunch more than an individual with 5 houses, and 400 million in the bank. the millionaire may put out 1.5 million in taxes compared to the working class family who puts out 2,500 in taxes, but the loss of money is felt more keenly at the lower income levels.

so my question is, what does this section mean for bitcoin? I assume therei s no administrator who has the authority to redeem the currency from the public... and if its not. then we can only land in the users section. The exchanger who converts dollars to coins falls here and is subject to the book keeping rules.
so here is my question. If I have bitcoins and I want dollars. I meetup with Joe who has dollars. we trade. am I a user, or exchanger or is he? and who is required to keep the records? and how do you identify for each transaction who is the user and who is the exchanger?

got my first coins when they were about 12 a piece. /kicks self. I am not sure of the final price per se, but I believe the technology is valid and really thats all that matters. sucks that i wont make a fortune but thats life. bitcoinity is lagging from mtgox, at an hour behind, and thats at 143usd now /sigh. goodness knows what the actual price is but whatever. I love cryptology and I "like" money so ill stick with it without risking my monthly budget.
but if you are going to be traveling the world (as someone who did the same through the military) bitcoins when stable would be absolutely awesome. no real risk of it getting stolen, no need for much physical cash. (maybe replenish some cash on hand when you meet up with traders) where do you plan on going?

yes, I understand the brain wallet passive checking thing. I attempted at one point(grandly i might add) of hashing a standard dictionary, and several gigs worth of leaked website passwords into private keys to check against the chain(lost interest just didn't have the computing power to even get 1% of the way through the word list i was working with. so believe me I do understand.
My point is this, for standard use yes use the generated addresses. it is logically, nearly impossible to guess the private key from a good sentence you just came up with specific to you as an individual with the plus side is that its easily remembered. just in case of failure or seizure of the wallet.
I have read(just read I haven't physically played with so there is that) about some of the big password cracking beasts that hash billions of times a second in addition to doing intelligent permutation. But even with that all its doing is passWORD cracking, not sentence string hashing. Sure there have been people who have taken all the digitized they can get their hands on and hashed the crap out of them if not then I am over estimating them. 
That being said there isn't a password cracking beast out there that can crack **in a reasonable amount of time, meaning 40yrs)  1-2 short sentences or I will even go further. take the following, its easy to remember and I have seen no proof or anything but speculation of speculation that it "might" be crackable one day. This makes 1 assumption and that is that you are not being targeted specially and have the data to begin with in a big pile of data.
"my name birthdate last4social wife-name birthdate last4social kid1 bday social kid2 bday social"
when filled out there isn't a computer out there that can correctly get the private key from this string. you would even knowing the structure, have to have multi-length variables for every section except social(depends on how much of the social you use). use non English names? that's even better.


 
k that brain wallet was stupid, plain and simple. not long enough IMO whoever put money there was an idiot.
it should have read "man i made it to the moon! but little barbra butter butt thought it stunk like some kind of stinky yellow cheese meh screw that then."
That would have been infinitely better and that's even with no numbers! 
 


 
2nd bad example, all these show is that either some individuals who are playing with bitcoins are dumber than the average fungus, or some intelligent individuals sometimes make stupid mistakes too.
a nice quote to remember:


@_date: 2013-03-06 20:27:19
up right now. but if i bought 40 coins at  and i intend to actually use them now, i run the risk of their purchasing power dropping unexpectedly back down to 25. The large swings while nice to see I have greater purchasing power also make me weary.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:52:28
A healthier approach might to be, instead of how many dollars I made, consider how much more purchasing power I now have with the same coins.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:14:36

that would be a nice and neat analogy if the taxes went to just one item. which they don't.


some(not all) people would reason that they would be glad to pay taxes they belive in, schools, roads, certain military funding. But the sad choice is we dont have a choice where our tax dollars go. Perhaps the argument can be made we elect the politicians who then decide but thats a very sloppy way to do it.


very much so".


you seem to be a bit on the agressive side here not everyone, who is using bitcoins and considering their tax situation and how much to pay or not is an asshole and criminal.


thats good to know but when the US collapses and US ISPs go out of business"
there will still be plenty of internet connectivity around the world to keep the ledger(blockchain) intact. I doubt that it will come to a full collapse like that however. many of these predictions base bitcoins future off past events when bitcoin is such a shift to the traditional way of thinking about money, taxes etc that it can really develop into anything.

I do not doubt that sections of the gov are useful for only for lying and deception, but with as fragmented as the "government" is, it does have good points/sections that generally are not about lying and making us miserable. I just figured that with the bitcoin address method it would allow the people to choose what got the funding rather than the politicians and their pet projects. 
CIA NSA etc do deserve funding but not the blank check that they have now.
with that address thing i could also put my tax dollars to work where I feel the US needs to do the most work.

Unfortunately you are wrong in your math. they are divisible by 8 places(as it currently is) which means that the most a single whole bitcoin 1.00000000 can be worth would be 999,999.99$. this is premised by the .01cent = 1 satoshi or .00000001. Anything less than that would mean that a satoshi would be worth more than 1 cent and you would no longer be able to break down a coin to .01USD increments.

You know about Cyprus? right? and the fear thats not plaguing spain. and the FCC reviewing its obligations in the wake of Financial failure in a bank. The safety of your money in the bank is not as secure as almost everyone believes it to be. Thats why people with alot of money, they dont put their cash in banks. Its spread out across land property, gold, investments, Art purchases just to name a few.
Besides. everything i mentioned aside. the money you put in a bank for safe keeping is used by the bankers to loan out to other people and businesses with interest paid to the bank. you see very little if any of this interest returned to you for use of your money. and it exposes your money to be defaulted on which is what happens when banks fail.

Your right, if bitcoin was a direct threat to the economy(its a threat to certain to bank profit margins and others profits but not a threat to the actual economy). which at this point or in 5 years it is not a threat. a threat would be printing a massive amount of 100s in counterfeit money(or something like it) to distribute in the us to destabilize our economy and for sure they would/among other agencies too not just those listed, to get in gear and start to take notice. But as bitcoin is right now its just a exchange and a different form of currency. with bitcoin as it is, bitcoin itself is not making the USD deflate, btc just equalizes to the dollar now at 30+ to a dollar and life goes on.
Like I said in another reply, yes billions can be spent. Billions can be spent even in a 5 year period. But not without raising the attention of news/people who keep eyes on what is being lobbied and that exposure without a previous public image campaign to distort bitcoins objective, would leave them open for public opinion to be in favor of bitcoin after all and making their battle more difficult. So for the agencies to launch a 51% attack in 5 years time, bitcoin would need to be feared to destabilize the us economy, lobbyists would need to pay out billions without attracting the attention of people who are specifically looking for stuff like this, and would need to be reasonably sure that the resulting attention would be nagative for bitcoin and not positive reinforcement. 
Long term maybe but with those hurdles I cant see it happening in 5 years.

perhaps the sub needs more skeptics. i doubt that it is just over inflated tulips. with currency you have the chicken and the egg scenario, which came first the currency or the shops that would take it? when the currency is from the government the point is moot as they can just make it a law, but with something as unregulated as bitcoin you fall into that balance. you can buy things, not everything you can with a dollar, but you can buy things. Personally I dont think it will be a dollar replacement, it will be a store of wealth and a means of transfer more likely. I state that because of the current (they are changeable yes) transaction limits per block and the confirm times. and also the worldwide public ledger. I dont really like the idea of all my transactions being open to the public even if its pseudo anon. i would just use it for wealth storage and transfer. the most important factor for me is the fact that in theory it cannot be seized from me by the government. perhaps thats the motivating factor for others as well.

I mean if deflation is going at a steady 2% (after things even out) and I have 500btc, I could lend it out at a rate of 5% and I would be making double what I would just keeping it in pocket. Though the counter to that is, why loan with the possibility of default when you are absolutely guaranteed 2-3% just keeping it in your own address.

This seems to crop up every once in a while. Here is the best course of action i recommend. go to bitaddress.org and create a brain wallet/passphrase. Its important to use a phrase here not just a word. something like "Over the hills and vallies I go laustcozz lol" something you will remember or very likely remember. add that into bitaddress and it will give you the private key. Take that private key over to passguardian.com and break it into like 5 different keys with a threshold of 3. Give 3 keys out to friends (printed is the safest) and keep 2 for you.
Now what you have done is: you have a brain wallet that you can send coins to, and all you have to do is remember the password. You have a backup method if you ever forget the password to retrieve the private key. if someone breaks into your house and steals your safe just go to your 3 friends and retrieve their paper copies and recover the funds. if you just forget goto one friend get his key, and recover your funds.
modify how you would like to cover the amount of people you wish to involve.
I think this covers your bases no?

i can see facebook putting the nail in that coffin quickly. they dont want competing currencies to their own little facebook bucks or whatever.

just had a thought. if the gov got a bit smart and embraced bitcoin just alittle. if we were say required to pay 1000 in tax for the year, why not create a bunch of coin addresses for different departments in the government. ie a bitcoin address for the overall government, an address just for the department of defense, an address for NSA CIA, and umbrella addresses that would pay all the other addresses in the end too. that way if you dont support the war and the use of bombs/drones dont send your taxable bitcoins to those addresses/and or the address above them. send it to the addresses regarding humanitarian aid etc.

hm not all are in the US, but a large portion are. 


Current money in circulation is 853 billion so even if you printed 100 million outright the deflation would barely be noticeable if noticeable at all.
so lets examine this more closely. 
if you released 100m into the economy, one it has to come from somewhere, and has to go to somewhere. 
just because an item appreciates in value does not mean the usd has to depreciate. we will trade bitcoins for houses in this example
i buy a plot of land(ie pay for comp hardware, time, electricity) to build a house. it costs me 200,000 dollars to make that house sell-able. I list the house and according to what other people want to pay for said house, the house(bitcoin) is worth 100 million (i know big appreciation but need to show the concept). I haven't printed money(like counterfeit) someone somewhere will cough up the 100 million to pay for the house and I will be 100 million richer. and from that point on the other individual has a 100 million dollar house(bitcoin) and I have 100 million in cash. The value of the dollar wont drop at all because of this.
Now if I took that 100 million and gave it away for free to thousands of people in a particular area, it might devalue and raise the cost of living in an area for a short while but nothing major.
we would need much larger numbers 20+ billion at least, given away for free to see an effect in the value of usd. otherwise the equation is balanced by what you paid for.

i agree, sweden norway and denmark, they do very well. unfortunately those in power in the US wont take them as an example. oh, do you have the link to the ted talk? it sounds interesting. I agree with you whole heatedly.
@_date: 2013-02-13 16:01:19
I am in the same boat. its been over 12 hours and they paid me with unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:27:24
perhaps. and considering the early adopters were techy to start with. :)

Elaboration is our friend here. Tell me how I'm flawed. Without rehashing the same points I have already disputed

I gotcha, even after all this time I am just now coming to understand bitcoin in general. so here we go


yes. and funds are moved from the old address, and sent to 2 directions, who you sent coins too and the change address(change address is where all the change goes and is typically the newly generated address and is added to your wallet right then and there.)


kind of. The wallet.dat just houses the public and private keys. the bitcoin client checks the blockchain itself to see if those addresses have any funds signed/attached to them. if i would have to guess i would say the wallet.dat file would basically look something like
public key, private key
public key, private key
public key, private key
it doesnt actually store the number of coins attached to each address the client references the blockchain to figure that out.


none of the coins are stored in the wallet.dat file. what is actually stored is the private key, this key lets you talk to the blockchain and and tell the world/blockchain you wish to sign over funds from one public address to another. lose the private key(which is stored in the wallet.dat file) and lose access and the ability to sign away/move funds off the corresponding public key. the coins will always be at the public key address, but since no one has the private key to move funds off of the address(cause you lost the wallet.dat file) they remain there forever.
I would recommend instead of putting it into the SR account, put the bulk of it into a brain wallet. what this is is this - you think of a password/phrase and enter it into bitaddress.org's section for brain wallet. it will then generate a public and private key pair for that phrase. dump your funds into that single public key address. Doing it this way you will always(as long as you know your password) the public/private key for your funds and you may never lose them.
Also one last distinction even though it says brain wallet its still just a single address.
Wallets are actually made up of multiple addresses all sandwiched into a single file for easy storage.
any other questions you have i would be happy to answer to the best of my ability.

so according to that page do you see any transactions you did not make or were aware of?
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:21:40
dividing the coin down past 8 places, or increasing the 21m coin count do the same thing. but neither of them are really needed. if/when it hits bit adoption no one will carry a full coin. and people will using the bitcents at that point.

while reading it, i just thought of something, why not as the guy is walking up, snap a couple of pictures of him, just casually. explain it to him that if anything goes bad with the transaction, you just give the police his photo. and since you have your phone out too, snap a picture of the car license plate as it pulled up.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:58:04
that and in order for this to function(not function well but just function) you would need to deposit it to an address they generate then abstractly they need to tell you how much you have. what stops them from taking in 1000 BTC, then use all but 10 btc for investing, but now everyone's account still says the original amount. your basically asking for fractional reserve banking, again which is the system we are trying to get away from as well.

I think passguardian is what you need. I know you said you dont want a scavenger hunt, but it seems rather than some puzzle(and for their sake) what you need is just a consensus from a majority of your relatives. if you have 5 people who are your trusted people make it so that you need 3 or 4 of them to get the private address. still give everyone a copy of the letter(edited so it makes sense for pg) and just give everyone their unique key to keep safe and sound. then if something happens the 3 can get together and retrieve the funds. but are you looking at of the trusted group, ANY of them getting access?

I have a small 50$ transaction that I have been waiting a week for it to complete. I would be a bit perturbed if it were canceled in the last few hours.
