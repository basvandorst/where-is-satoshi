The new government in S.Korea is very cozy with China, which fears the continuation of capital flight through Korean exchanges. Not surprised by their moves.

Time  to change banks, let them know why you did so in a personal meeting.,I’ve done that in the past regarding a controversial decision by my bank. There are always forces within an organization that are against the decision and they will use your reason to support their argument. I later got a phone call from the branch manager to confirm that I did indeed switch bank for that reason.

Great stuff! Perhaps some Chinese crypto investors will then prefer Bitflyer over Bithumb for some reason?...

you don’t understand how capital flight works if you think there won’t be a premium in markets with currency controls

Agreed, it's optional and in competition to other protocols like it. At least that's the way I understood it. I can see a future where perhaps a dozen well-established service providers compete for the best payment services which only later gets added to the block chain.

I really don't agree with the skepticism on here. If you want to use smaller exchanges or alternative means of buying and transferring bitcoin great, nobody stops you from doing that.  
But the lack of transparency in the huge crypto market worries many people for good reason. A well-run SRO could provide much-needed trust and real audited information to potential investors and the public at large. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:28:02
I think currently there’s no need for too much marketing. It’s still early tech, once ln and convenient payment channels are in place that changes.

It’s really simple, sell a bit when prices are high, buy a bit when they’re low
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:57:50
Exactly what I did, sold a good portion at 8000 only to re-enter again 300 USD lower, still not bottomed out but that's fine. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:15:56
Meet me then. I’ve constantly lowered my average purchasing price throughout the last two years through systematic trades.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:23:22
Yes exactly, my sell order went through at 8.7k and now I’ve been able to buy back in at 7.7 roughly. It may go down further at which case I’ll buy at 7.2k. The real advantage of a system is it takes predictions and emotions out of the game and you’ll never miss a high or low.

I am among the people who pay high fees, but my orders are executed within seconds usually. It would be nice to have the option to change priority per order but that's not yet the case. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:08:58
I have been downvoted for this suggestion countless times but it has worked really well for me over the years so here it is:
\- Average your way into a lower price for your Bitcoin (or other crypto) by buying and selling at predefined steps (usually 8-10% for me) regardless of when you started buying
\- If BTC reaches a weekly/monthly high sell some\* (\*anywhere between 2.5 - 5% of my total holdings per transaction) through preset sales orders. Don't ever buy or sell based on your feelings or emotions
\- I never go below 50% of my maximum btc holdings, even at the peak in late '17
\- Automatically set the buy order again 10% lower than what you sold it for, few buy orders over the years have not been eventually filled
I don't know where the price is going, nor does anyone else. But having a system set up where I profit either way, takes a bit of risk off the table and disables me from trading instinctively has been an absolute blessing over the last few years.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:45:47
Maybe sure, but it's an older article over an incident that actually seemed to have happened - so the difficulty of withdrawing USD from bitfinex maybe force enough traders to buy BTC (or other crypto) on it and send it to another exchange to make a notable difference in price?
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:43:35
I don’t mind it either, will buy back what I sold a few months ago at a much lower price.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:39:52
Your dad knows what's up, I've been buying as well. If you believe in the usefulness of the underlying technology, believe in what is being developed then the current slump is nothing but a discount to buy in more. If you look at it purely from a speculative perspective or you need the liquidity then it obviously isn't a great time. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:05:07
I think the liquidity crunch in China and Bitmain possibly exiting the market could have strongly contributed to this.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:59:43
that’s exactly right, will probably blame everyone but themselves when the price rises again. Buy high and sell low has been a meme for so long it’s become an ideology for many.
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:39:35
I mean people in general not you specifically 
@_date: 2018-11-16 13:02:01
Why do you think they pay a premium? Because they can't easily open accounts in Korea and Japan anymore. Chinese pay far more than 10% to get their savings or corporate earnings out of the country, most other venues including gambling in Macao have been cracked down on. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:57:28
Holding should not mean you just keep whatever you have. Dollar averaging has been a very consistent strategy and allows you to profit even from a bear market. Accumulating btc and lowering my average entry price is what I’m doing right now. Once the price rises I sell off a bit to lock in profits and retain liquidity. This concept has been explained countless times by people cleverer than me and probably you.
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:32:40
Sure, people want all of these, but not necessarily in the same exchange. There’s just so much room for improvement, it doesn’t feel like the future of banking at all right now

I sure am increasing my holding

Aren’t we done with the stupid memes at some point? more actual content and analysis would be appreciated 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:21:38
My personal strategy is to sell off a part of my holding at temporary highs, and buy back in some 10% lower. I do that on a constant basis, which makes me feel I "profit" from the price decline, even though the overall value of my holding of course declines.  But overall I have great confidence that we're finally getting the tools and infrastructure to implement large-scale vendor implementation, which should create much more transactions and people buying back in in the months to come. So I'm not overly worried about these price drops. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:43:06
I’m one of the people currently buying, simply because I don’t see how anything has changed from a technological or legislative perspective.  
Personally I expect it to go much beyond that in the long run, but I’m willing to hold it a year or two if need be.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:49:55
People can only blame themselves for their continued herd mentality. Buy high and sell low is nobody’s fault but yours. I sold when people bought into the 30k craze and now I’m buying, ready to invest more should it go below 4k.
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:53:28
I just made a few k within a day, and I’ll make so much more long term. I don’t need hype, I need better technology and related services.

I think the article falls short on a few things. There isn't that much of a difference between consensus and a 51% decision within a group, society, company or in this case, a currency. In both cases people may just decide to opt out if they disagree, in both cases people may freely express their opinion and decide their individual action based on the outcome of a group. Whether that means you don't go to the restaurant chosen, you don't continue to participate in a society - it's still up to you, just like in Bitcoin. 
There is an element of coercion in a democracy that is necessary for a government in order to protect the common interest. Bitcoin is no democracy simply because there is no coercive element required, it's completely up to the people whether or not they want to use it. Other than it's about as democratic a currency, tech or venture you'll find.  
In short the consensus vs majority vote has much fewer practical implications, because the minority may still do what they chose either way. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:23:47
Nonsense. Sounds funny but a lack of institutions isn't democratic. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:33:29
Not wrong but you use too high a standard to define a currency. Think Zimbabwe or Venezuela, rubbish currencies which fail everyone one of your tests but still currencies. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 08:59:37
Will look into it, sounds interesting. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:27:23
You're far, far ahead of developments. Currently you'd only need the US and EU declare any non-fiat transactions illegal to effectively kill any prospects of Bitcoin becoming big.  Hubris has never served anyone well, the internet of tomorrow may not be what we think it is today, let us not become complacent and ignorant, there are lots of hurdles to overcome to make Bitcoin what we want it to be. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:06:11
I will take them off you for 3k each, last offer. Buy high sell low is the consensus right now.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:03:56
I tend to agree, but the meme here is just plain wrong. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:19:20
Do you hold any illusions that it isn't already so? So-called representative democracies seem to always result in strong political elites that collude with media and the economic establishment, often to the detriment of the common citizen.  I believe until we have an extremely decentralized, democratic form of self-governance similar to Switzerland we can't ever achieve being truly sovereign citizens of our own countries.  Authoritarian rule prospers wherever people are declared unfit to decide over their own fate. And that, to me, is the true value of Bitcoin. I decide where my money flows, I decide what investment decisions I make. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:20:52
Oh absolutely, not saying people should put their entire net worth into btc at all. But if you believe in the future of the technology short term price movements shouldn’t bother you too much 
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:33:47
Nice, consider trading a part of it on a regular basis to constantly lock in some profits and buy back in lower 
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:06:06
Exactly, and part of the trouble currently is that even relatively advanced users sometimes aren’t aware that they’re doing the online equivalent of walking around with thousands of dollars in their pockets. Just because nobody stole it yet doesn’t mean it’s safe. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:26:42
I always get downvoted when I recommend this but I make sure I take off some profits at preset values (+10%) of the last/lowest buy in, and buy back in at 90% of the sell value.  Always keep 75% of my btc and trade with the rest, it’s been very lucrative.
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:34:19
It’s quite conceivable that Bitmain among others sold off most of their crypto stock, I don’t think the CCP wants them to produce crypto miners forever. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:10:22
Look I agree, but the fact is we're headed towards a state where all your online activities are fully transparent to your government, and all attempts to get around that will be strictly outlawed and criminalised.  China is simply the first country to attempt to control any and all online activities of its citizens, but do you have any faith in that this won't happen everywhere else?  All I'm saying is: let's not be naive to the very real danger of how the internet being almost fully in control of governments once again. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:19:47
It goes up and down, fairly controversial opinion it seems though I don’t see it that way. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 07:37:33
That's right, but we've seen how it went with China. First they banned Crypto exchanges in China, these exchanges then moved to Korea, Japan and continued to operate in a very unregulated way. In came crypto regulations in Korea forcing identification and banning foreign transfers, effectively making S.Korea a crypto island with divergent prices. In the end it's probably safe to say that the vast majority of Chinese bitcoin trading simply disappeared over the course of this and last year. Not 100%, but perhaps 90%. Now compound that with similar regulatory actions in the US and EU, it would be orders of magnitude more difficulty for ordinary people to participate in btc.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:40:30
Of course they can’t ban bitcoin, but they can easily shut down all exchanges and fiat transactions, and ban establishments from accepting bitcoin, rendering it virtually useless.  
Once people can’t (legally) buy or use bitcoin it’s basically dead. To disregard regulatory risks is foolish.
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:16:05
For a long time, just think at some point we should simply ignore bch and other shit coins 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:34:00
I strongly disagree, maybe I’ve lived in China too long, but my base assumption is always when any entity has an inherent interest to fight something they will.  Nothing paranoid about that, just governments doing what serves their interests, at the expense of ordinary people.
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:25:05
That’s exactly right, well put. And governments of tomorrow will likely have much more oversight and full transparency over all your payments, severely limiting your options to divert funds. Just look at cashless Sweden or soon China for example.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:27:33
I wish you were right but frankly I think you naively underestimate the power of governments.   
The worlds banking system is highly dependent on a few key countries, it’s very easy to ban any transactions to crypto exchanges for the vast majority of the population.  
Or imagine a few countries start outlawing commercial transactions with anything but local tender. How many stores would continue accepting btc?    
Or companies aren’t allowed to develop alternative currencies. Say goodbye to LN, Blockchain. These are just the most straightforward ways to block Btc’s rise.   As I said, they can’t ban it of course, but they can make it utterly useless and not worth the risk for the vast majority of people.
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:34:07
I disagree, I would even go as far as saying they’re useful to speed up security developments in all crypto related software and infrastructure. Exchanges still aren’t safe enough, wallets need better and more straightforward protection still.     
Bitcoin needs to be ultra simple and ultra secure to achieve mainstream adoption, we’re still years away from achieving that.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:11:20
you're frustrated that you buy high and sell low.. that's understandable. but others, like me, have a bit more of a systematic approach, and lock in profits and buy back in later... good for a bear market, you should try it... 
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:57:04
If you’re not buying now then when? Either you fundamentally believe in a future and load up or you don’t, in which case no price point would make you enter the market. I’m in the former camp.
