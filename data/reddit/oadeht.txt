Have you seen it when money is involved?

~~First I've heard of this, proof?~~
  
Saw the threads you are talking about and looks like an issue with their payment processor and they are working on it.  I highly doubt coinbase would need to scam anyone out of their money, they are the most used online wallet in the west.

We have the best smart contracts, don't we love our smart contracts?

It might be a big deal but it was driven by competition from our point of view since coinbase was not the first to do it, so they will get less praise for doing it.  Don't get me wrong, it is nice to see them grow and branch out, I just wish they would be a leader in the space and not a follower.  It makes me look elsewhere since I can't look to them to lead and innovate.  So I'm not going to spend time praising them for something I think they should have done many months ago.

I'm not sure about instructions, I learned about this from a reddit post about a wallet someone wanted to crack but couldn't so I learned about it on my own.
  
Basically you download the source code for bitaddress.org at 
  
Then you run it on a secure machine, preferably a machine or virtual machine purpose built for this and offline.  You use the bitaddress software to create your encrypted BIP38 wallets making sure to use strong passwords you will not forget.  Then you just backup the encrypted wallet and send funds to its address.  You can backup it up online or by making a bunch of physical copies and putting them in safe places, I do both.
  
As long as your password is good, BIP38 is very hard to impossible to crack so I am comfortable leaving multiple copies in gmail, outlook.com etc.
  
Good passwords will use unicode characters spread across multiple unicode sets.  For instance, It will not be a strong password if you use only characters printed on your keyboard unless it is really long but that makes it hard to remember.  I have a 7 characters password that is super easy to remember but uses weird characters.
I recommend generating a BIP38 wallet and then sweep the funds so you can see how it works and get comfortable.  It is important that whatever BIP38 wallets you decide to use are not used for spending, once you sweep keys from a BIP38 wallet, never use it again, sweep all the funds and use a different wallet moving forward.

It was worth a lot less when he made it.  He spent bitcoin like it was play money and I can't find any conversations on his part that demonstrate he had any kind of vision about its future potential.  He just used it as a tool to facilitate his illegal market.  Ulbricht relied on the intelligence of others to further himself and that is why he ultimately got caught and with so much evidence exposed to incriminate him.  If it wasn't for people like Variety Jones, he would have been caught a lot sooner.

email yourself an encrypted wallet using gmail or something that isn't going away, a wallet encrypted using BIP38 and a strong password you will not forget.  This way you can access it anywhere in the world as long as you have internet access.  I'd personally email it to multiple online email accounts.  BIP38 is basically impossible to crack with a good password.  A good password uses a different characters from various unicode sets.  The more sets you can include in your password, the harder it makes it to crack.

Ross Ulbricht had shitty OPSEC.  If he had not been a lazy ass the FBI wouldn't have been able to touch his coins.

They grabbed his laptop while he was logged into his linux laptop(HD decrypted).  The FBI could see everything because he didn't encrypt data at rest, just used the HD encryption for the OS.  Which was stupid, stupid, stupid!
  
He should have encrypted everything separately, especially since he liked to save all communications and kept a journal of everything in a text file.  I am 100% certain this fact will haunt him for the rest of his life.
