I think about investing in a new crypto currency, a recoin, there are many advantages and advantages, but for now I want to gather information. Who has any information about the rekoin? As far as I know this is the only Crypto currency in the current market that is supported by real estate in the US, Canada, Switzerland and Japan, and 6 percent of each transaction is donated to charity, and not many crypto-keepers may brag about: the full compliance with the US law and The guarantee of the RECoin at 70% of its current market if anything goes haywire. Well, as it will be seen in practice in August...

Ohh! Good for you! I even don't know ... It's a lot of popular site acsept it!

I would not be so categorical, but I agree that bitcoin is an order of magnitude more efficient in energy.

Yeah. The best choise is rent ore in general Real estate

Thus a question arises - perhaps the creator aspired to this? Perhaps this is his ultimate goal, who knows ...

How do you think that under this condition can affect society?

As the community gets larger, this will get harder - Consensus is a difficult thing to achieve. Either the project stalls and dies, or the percentage needed to achieve consensus is lowered. SW2x is the first real test of the "decentralized" community governing itself. Right now we have the only path forward. bitcoin sinks or swims by what happens now.

When bitmoine-mining becomes more competitive and less profitable, some miners stop their activities. In addition, all the energy spent for mining somehow turns into heat, and the most successful miners will be those who will use this heat for something else. Optimum working network of mining, it is actually one that does not expend any additional energy.

I just come back from Switzerland. This is great news, and I think it is very convenient and will be in demand not to wait for queues.

I even don't know it. So it's explaine smth

The use of energy to operate the payment system and to ensure its security can not be called a waste. As with any other payment system, Bitcoin's use entails operating costs. The services necessary for the operation of existing financial structures, such as banks, credit cards and transport for collection, also use a lot of energy. However, unlike Bitcoin, the total amount of energy consumed is not obvious and can not be easily measured.

Considering the growth of bitcoin and the latest news, yes, it is not so

I imagine hove a by my new dress on bitcoins ). By the way in Switzerland you can buy a ticket for a train in bitcoins

This is exactly at the expense of factories and plants in China

Minimal transaction fees as compared to credit cards it's profatable for users, but bad for goverment and banks )

Bitcoin-mining is designed so that over time it will become more optimized, with specialized equipment consuming less energy, and its operating costs should be in proportion to demand. When bitmoine-mining becomes more competitive and less profitable, some miners stop their activities

Are you shure?

The US Financial Crimes Network (FinCEN), a division of the US Department of the Treasury, has issued an optional guide on how it characterizes some of the activities that include virtual currencies.

Why not, I know a lot of startaps on bitcoins

Optimum working network of mining, it is actually one that does not expend any additional energy. Although this is an ideal, the economy of mining is such that the miners themselves will strive for this.

Paul Sztorc's drivechains concept can potentially deliver miner-controlled, 
much larger blocks in the near future. This comes at the expense of 
decentralisation, of course, but as a drivechain, this loss does not directly 
affect the main chain, which can continue to develop according to the goals of 
the decentralisation-first group. There is a reduction in security of the 
drivechain since miners effectively make all the final decisions for it, but 
the adoption-first group tends to embrace and desire this miner-driven model 
So by using a drivechain, it is in fact possible to achieve two blockchains 
achieving the goals of each group, and both remaining part of the same Bitcoin 
network and using the same bitcoins.

Right now markets are heating up because of three factors: jurisdictions are making it clear that investing in these assets is not against the law when following established guidelines, its easier to acquire assets via exchanges, and no other sector is producing the short-term returns that this sector is creating. This is starting to attract institutional money, hot money and speculative money as investors place their positions in the market, seek to profit, and ride the rollercoaster. Not all assets will be winners, but there are thousands of stocks that do well globally in a given year. These cryptocurrencies are somewhere between a stock and an asset in terms of their ability to provide returns to participants interested in the storyline of each particular project.

You need to create another purse, buy bitokoyn separately and pay if the buyer will really free your car, you will get your "working files", as well as a purse.
