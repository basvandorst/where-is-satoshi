For one, I won't be adding websites that are less than 2 days old and crappy sites. I'll use my judgement and common sense, and feedback from users. I can guarantee anything though. Its just an attempt at doing it.

I've added some examples to give a better idea of how the submissions look like.

I agree with what you are saying. Identifying scammers can be quite problematic, but its still possible to reduce the number of scams. For example, many newbies lost coins during bitcoin black Friday because they didn't check the links being submitted. Also, many of the current website are full of links to gambling/faucets and what not, which I won't be adding to the list. I'm also trying to provide proper info about where people can spend their coins without them having to go through a large list, look at spendbitcoins.com for example, the layout doesn't really help identifying what you are looking for.
edit: I'm currently using a free hosting at serverbros (which they were giving away to redditors), which I had before starting the website, that explains the url frame. I'll use a proper hosting it this actually works out.

Well, your concern is understandable. Thanks for your support. 
I'm trying my best to figure out how to make this work.

Thank you for your advice! I too think a faq section might help. Thanks.

Coinmap mostly provides locations of brick and mortar stores. Once again, I'm not guaranteeing anything, just trying to provide a better platform for people to use. I'm also trying to make it possible for people to comment on specific links so as to get better feedback on the websites listed.

How would I scam people with that? I'm not asking for money or anything.
