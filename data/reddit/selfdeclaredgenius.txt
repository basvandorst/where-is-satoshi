You're putting words in my mouth, I never said BCH was worthless.
And that's a silly comparison given my entire objection was sw2x's  lack of replay protection, exactly unlike BCH.

Coinbase released a statement saying they'd make their BTC hodlers (at the point of the fork) whole when it comes to BCH, as soon as they can get it implemented, IIRC they're targeting 2018.
Edit: [Found it](

TL;DR: !

The technical issue I keep hearing about is that the increased block size will cause unfair load on nodes in terms of data storage and bandwidth, making it expensive beyond the reach of the underprivileged node-runners who are apparently trying to run full nodes on a thrift-store raspberry pi.
Sounds like a corner case to me.  I mean, was there this much whining when it came to be that you couldn't really mine on anything but an expensive asic?

Because some transactions have multiple inputs, the best you could do is estimate it with weighted averages at each step as you backtrace the blockchain, but you can't get an exact figure.

I don't know how anyone can consider SegWit2X as anything other than useless and worthless given their fundamentally shitty planning.  If using it puts my BTC at risk of a replay, it's a non-starter.
Someone should set up a system that deliberately replays every single transaction so this thing is forced into irrelevance from the start.

Possibly if s2x turns into a fiasco.  But I'm going to go ahead and hope it does NOT.

People that want to either hold it or use it for payments have to own some first before they can do either.  That's demand.

That's entirely untrue.  Core devs could simply increase the block size limit in their own codebase and continue to use it.

Every time he brings it up, praise BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:39:01


That's ridiculous.  They could simply make their own code base allow larger blocks, they wouldn't have to be under Garzik's thumb.

Mistakenly read your username as jamiedimon at first.  Thanks for the unintentional belly-laugh.

You appear to be contradicting yourself.


Here you say T goes up.
 


Here you imply T goes down, because if they're saving more they're necessarily spending less.
Perhaps you can clarify?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:40:26


Exactly.  If core devs quit over this, it's because they choose to, not because they were "forced out".
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:04:29
That's one way of looking at it.  Another is that BCash, while having some issues, still isn't vulnerable to being hijacked by miners to the extent that BTC is facing.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:54:41
Nope, it's their choice.  Hell, if the core devs would implement EDA s2x would be as good as dead.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:04:01
Emergency difficulty adjustment.  It's a quicker way to recover if you lose most of your hashpower, which is currently pretty much the only lever miners have to extort everyone else with.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:26:45
Implement EDAs, it takes the teeth out of a major miner revolt.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:52:20


You know who is really in control? The market, same as always.  If s2x wins, it's because their coin has more value in the market than s1x coin, and vice versa.    The devs get to call the shots for only as long as they are making the best choices according to the market.  If they get overruled, it's because they chose poorly according to the market.
If the devs get "vetoed", that's not an attack, that's just a cold dose of reality.
I for one side with the devs and hope they win FWTW, but let's not kid ourselves, bitcoin isn't a dev dictatorship.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:56:38


Sure, it's *slightly* more expensive, but it's not prohibitively so.  My systems will hardly notice any difference at all (although I'll continue to run as s1x as long as it's viable.)  I don't see it as a reasonable requirement that a node can run on a thrift-store raspberry pi.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:54:17
There will always be mining because of transaction fees.  To the degree that mining is unprofitable, miners will diminish but bitcoin addresses this by lowering the difficulty.  Accordingly, an equilibrium between transactions fees and mining expenses will be maintained.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:14:14


That's untrue.  The core devs are choosing to quit if s2x takes over, nobody is forcing them out.  They could just as easily continue development with a larger block size if s2x successfully dominates.
I favor small blocks and I hope s2x dies immediately, but if the opposite happens and the core devs leave it's because of their own immaturity and nothing else.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:59:02
I can't see why the lack of replay protection does anything other than render segwit2x totally worthless, useless, and inconsequential.  
Since using the forked coin puts your BTC at risk, why would anyone ever, ever, ever do that?  OTOH, using your BTC puts your forked coin at risk, but who cares (it's a worthless piece of shit)?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:28:55
Again, s2x would NOT **require** btc1 code, as you falsely claimed.  
If core devs simply increased the block size in their codebase, any node running that software would be entirely compatible with s2x.
