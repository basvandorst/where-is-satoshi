who are you to determine $.05 as being adequate or even efficient?  WTF do you know?
And btw, $.05 is the fee you mentioned earlier when you accused me of being a cheap ass.
If fees can be $.00001, then let them be $.00001 - don't say $.05 is an adequate fee simply because you're staring at a jar of nickels on your dresser and making a determination of adequacy or affordability

What's the fix? And whats up with all the sock puppet accounts that do nothing but defend the blockstream vision without providing sound rationale?

They're not attacking it because its a threat. They're attacking it to force a damn fix.

But the gov't wants a big piece of the Bitcoin appreciation event that will likely happen: they want their cap gains tax from said saturation event. Once Bitcoin is widely distributed and has no meaningful scale to grow into, they won't care as much; but by then those govt institutions will no longer exist (which doesn't matter since those institutions only existed to make the men in them more powerful and wealthy).

No more than one mention every 6 months or so on popular TV and always mentioned as some fool's errand. I have never seen such an enduring flatline in tech adoption.  For years. Yay.
Nothing about using bitcoin has become easier or user friendly. Exchanges might be easier to join and more prolific, but that's not the protocol itself. Wallets are just as cumbersome and number of services is flat or dwindling. We're winning more and more each day.

It's not that they're not willing, its that they should not have to visit to know what the hell is going on with the fee structure lately that their transactions arent confirming. Some don't even speak English and don't have a community source of news (although keeping up to date with development shouldn't be a requirement for users).  
Come on, let's get rid of this notion that new bitcoin users need to know what the fuck is going on in the development space to use the damn thing!  Increase the damn block size so that people aren't left in the dark! You can work on whatever else concurrent to this! Right now, if I were a bitcoin user who didn't have knowledge of the bitcoin forums, what the hell am I supposed to do? Not use it?  Are we limiting our bitcoin user base to our little 10,000 active redditor base?  DEVS NEED TO OPEN THEIR EYES

What does the computer scientist know about markets? What does he know about economics and human psychology? What does the computer scientist know about finance? How does he know the solution if he is notoriously terrible at listening and naturally egomaniacal and selfish?
The computer scientist can know those things, but he doesn't know them by virtue of being a computer scientist.  If he is absorbed in the typical computer science subculture, odds are he's fucking terrible at all the above. Very few have the right mix, and I highly doubt they're all working for the same company.

How many autistic people run successful non-profits? Zero. They lack the ability to empathize with the needs of their end users. Core devs are not suited to run shit, as smart as they are. It's great that the software theyre developing is open sourced, because someone with the gift of mass marketing+technical insight will copy the good and leave the bs.
The market for autistic users has been fully tapped. To reach the layman, the 95%, we need solutions that are relevant to the present. 
Give the 95% the chance to come into this space so that they may be enlightened. But make haste.
Lastly, who's the developer who comes closest to embodying Satoshi's white paper; can you name him?

Bitcoin is not "too successful"; it's maxed out its growth in its current state.  So if by "too successful" you mean "failing" then yes, you're 10,000% correct and probably the greatest thinker of our time - Bitcoin is currently failing. 
PM me for a job opportunity; we can use insightful thinkers such as yourself.

OK, so what to do about it?

If Barry has time to post bs like this, then one can only assume that there is absolutely nothing interesting going on or on the horizon in his life.

You just need three separate mobile bitcoin apps that do their job really well:
One app for easy, secure storage (Trezor Mobile?)
One app for sending bitcoin to friends (think Venmo)
One app for point of sale x-actions 
These three applications should also be able to link to each other near-seamlessly
Yes, you could easily incorporate these three functions into one application, but that's not the point.
You have to compartmentalize and simplify functions for the average user.  Do not build in functions into an app just because you can; it takes too much work to navigate, or it's functions become shadowed or get lost in the mix

So what you're saying is they have no chance to survive, make their time?
