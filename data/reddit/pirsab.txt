THIS THIS THIS
It's the speculators that actually hamper the viability of cryptocurrencies.

But it's horrible for a currency. You leave home with some money for drinks, and an hour later your money doesn't cover your bill. Or, conversely, you accidentally paid the bartender too much because the exchange rate kept jumping around like crazy.
Unless there's stability, there won't be mass adoption of the BTC. (Buying BTC is **not** adopting it.)

I'm a buy and hold kind of person. I don't have anything invested in BTC, and that's because the volatility scares me. I do not see myself accepting BTC in exchange for goods and services, because the volatility is very real and very dangerous. Which is kinda sad, because to me, cryptocurrencies are a great idea. It just generally sucks that uninformed 'speculators' are so jumpy that the slightest of whispers either sends the BTC soaring or crashing.
I do not want to receive BTC from a client in exchange for services, because after I provide said services, I don't want to proceed to then find out my payment is worth half of what it was by the time it clears.
Yeah, other (read: fiat) currencies have speculators too, but they're a drop in the ocean. Fiat currencies have the backing of *massive* volume trading, universal acceptance and institutional backing. Bitcoin is far far away from even dreaming about achieving parity with fiat currencies right now.
tl;dr: I'm not a financial analyst but the price of BTC seems to be undergoing a prolonged seizure, and that makes it not too ideal for use as a currency. A commodity, maybe.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but these are people speculating that it will rise further, and are just riding the waves as long as the tide is high. Speculators don't want a rock solid stable commodity/currency/equity/etc. for investment. They want volatility.
This much volatility doesn't work well for currencies. If I had the money to speculate on BTC, I would have. But I don't see myself adopting it as a currency for any sort of transactions, precisely because of the volatility.
