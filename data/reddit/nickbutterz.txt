Well I think it might be safe to assume that this to some extent will create a paridigm shift. While maybe Bitcoin wont be used for regular everyday transactions, maybe it will be some other crypto, but the advantages are real. 
Let's put it this way, Western Union main business is the sending of payments globally. Even if Bitcoin is only used to move money across the globe cheeply and quickly wouldn't that be enough use to keep it going?

I wonder if the hype is all that is needed, once enough people are invested into Bitcoin and it becomes stable it would be hard to stop it because enough people agreed it is worth it. 
I feel like implying that it is a bubble doesn't actually make any sense to me. 
The dotcom bubble happened because everyone thought all of these websites would make a ton of money only to turn out that these companies weren't worth close to anything because they couldn't actually make money.
The housing bubble occured because it was really easy/cheap to get a loan for a house so people said fuck it I'm getting the biggest nicest house I can offered who cares, but really the banks relaxed their standards and these individuals couldn't afford the houses.
For Bitcoin wouldn't it make sense that as long as enough people buy into it then there is real value is created. If we all agree that Bitcoin is worth something than isn't it? No one expects Bitcoin to do anything other than be a safe place to store money, when that is no longer true than maybe the bubble will burst.
Obviously just my thoughts.
