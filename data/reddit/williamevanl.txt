Thanks for clearing this up. Welp, a new meme is born. Let's ah, get the website going, where folks have to register by signing that they are in said 6.15 BTC club.

How much of the internet is fake?! :)

Crypto Exchange Huobi Adds Support for Ethereum-Based Tether
Nothing strange – every trading platform now offers stablecoins. Huobi decided not to stand out and added Tether also. Nice done!

lol, I think you are kidding but if not, the level of noobness around here has exploded! btw, '1 bitcoin' is a totally arbitrary thing, it's also 100 million satoshis. Arg, this is probably a joke why did ...
