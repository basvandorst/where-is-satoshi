I think that getting scammed is a big problem with BTC right now. Malware is on most computers that are used by non-techie adults. Its just too easy to get tricked. 
BTC can be easily "stolen" by other means but that, I think, will be the biggest barrier to entry.
So I would say donate your BTC to someone or something who is dedicated to solving this problem.
What if there was a hardware device like a TPM chip in a laptop that needed to be used in combination with biometric finger print reader to sign transactions? Some kind of hardware two factor wallet. Keep an eye out for developers who are trying to solve this problem, so BTC can move to mainstream adoption and prevent the feeling you have from getting scammed being commonplace.

I am by far not a self proclaimed hip hop fan. However I don't know how someone could be an avid listener and have never heard of hieroglyphics or casual. ...

I wonder how these deals work. I know sites like truecar and edmunds send leads to the dealer in exchange for their sales, inventory, and financing data as well as monthly  membership fees. Then they use this data to provide value to the consumer. 
Since I doubt overstock has any interest in their data they are probably just paying a small fee to be listed.

The ability to accurately predict these things to that level from such an early point in his project boggles my mind.

I've been using betcoinsports.com for the last 2 weekends. I like it because it allows you to widthdrawl or deposit with litecoins or bitcoins. 
I was sitting on a bunch of LTC I wanted to convert back to BTC anyway.
Your deposit is turned into their proprietary casino credits, which are valued at 1/1000th of a bitcoin. 
Min bet is 5 so .005 bitcoin per bet. You can mess about preparing your bet ticket with different values and parlays etc etc to make sure you aren't getting screwed by them always rounding down in their favor. 
My only worry is widthdrawls are not instant, you have to wait for them to be approved. They claim this is due to people always trying to abuse their deposit bonus features.
Either way, I've widthdrawn twice, both times more than I deposited, and got my coins delivered within 30 mins on both occasions.
