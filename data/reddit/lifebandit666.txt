This is a Bitcoin debit card then? I looked at a couple of them and thought it was the best way to integrate Bitcoin into the real world but couldn't work out which was best for the UK. I'll have a look at this, thanks a lot!  
Edit: this changes everything! THANKYOU! 
Edit 2: it would, if the app worked. 
Edit 3: it worked on my tablet, I bought supplies from Amazon and Vampire Vapes for making e liquid. Thanks for the info. I hope the app works on the phone I'm saving up for. Hey! I could buy it in Bitcoin!

As a noob from the UK, any chance you have any quick reads to get me closer to knowing how to do what you're doing? Currently I have no idea how to pay either my rent or Amazon in Bitcoin, unless I transfer it back into fiat and pay with that, and that will take a week to hit my account to use. 
Edit: Thanks guys!

Wow, that's a proper list, thanks! Any of these have an Android app (except Xapo, bad reviews and I believe they charge a fiver a month for the card).
I've contacted them but I'm waiting for a response. I've got it working on my tablet though, trying to order mixing supplies for e liquid as we speak. 
As for the EU stuff, would that affect All4btc too? They pay for your purchase for you online and you pay them in Bitcoin. 
Would it affect US companies with a virtual wallet? I'm assuming Wirex is US based.

Oh no, don't get me wrong, it's still less convenient than fiat money. I had to transfer from my wallet to the debit card wallet, wait for it to be confirmed (10 minutes?), then transfer from that wallet to the card itself, then find the Keepass file with my card details saved in it and input that into the websites. 
As opposed to taking a card out of my pocket and copying the details on it.

I agree, do all that and remain decentralised and that's a winner. I've seen people on here attack the idea of a Bitcoin Debit Card because it is supporting the Bankers money system in some way, instead of pushing for adoption of Bitcoin and I suppose I can see a point there, BUT if you don't get people using it on a day to day basis, it's just got too high a bar for an average person to jump over to use it, so people, being lazy by nature, don't use it.

So they have no insurance and we have to trust that they will pay it back to us if they were hacked? 
So the safest way to stay secure while using Xapo is to just send the amount you want to use on your card from your own wallet when you want to use it. Right? 
Which is (admittedly I'm a noob so correct me if I'm wrong) the safest way to use any central Bitcoin company. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:09:46
FWIW theoretically at least, these Bitcoin cards will work with Android Pay and Apple Pay, I think. That would be very convenient.

The first I heard of it was a message off my Mum that Bitcoin had been hacked. I thought "No it hasn't" and came here to find out what was what. 
She's 63 so I count it as a win that she knew about it, especially before me.

Have you looked into Bitcoin debit cards? I've watched Bitcoin for about 4 years and just bought some to play with, and I was with you whole heartedly on the adoption issues until today, when someone linked me to Wirex. 
In my country (the UK) it's quite a rigmarole to get £ with Bitcoin. It's easy to buy Bitcoin but if you want money you're basically screwed. Or so I thought. 
Today I've been feeling a  little broke, until I discovered how easy it is to pay debit transactions with Bitcoin. I got home and bought some Vegetable Glycerin off Amazon and some concentrate off Vampire Vapes. It's only £20 of purchases but it's money I had basically written off. 
Wirex only does Euros, Pounds and Dollars so it may be useless to you, but I also found a website called all4btc which apparently purchases and sends you products off the internet and you pay in Bitcoin. You paste in the link, give them your address and pay them. No idea if it works or not, but it's there.

And even then, innocent until proven guilty, so they have to prove you did something illegal. For example, I am like OP, I like to educate myself, and the Internet interests me, so I have used Tor and been on the Darknet but I haven't done anything illegal. Even if I had, they have to prove it. Having Tor isn't proof that you have done something illegal.

Probably nothing since they state that they buy and transfer to their own wallet.

Nostalgia right there

That's your decision, and yours alone.

The only useful advice anyone can give you is this: only put in what you can afford to lose, and always have control of your private keys. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 17:20:01
That's gotta be better than Coinbase being hacked and losing all your money though, or your account being suspended and losing all your money, or forgetting your password and losing all your money...

Not just US, not buying or selling to anyone.

Thanks, I was feeling like I was stuck in a confirmation bias bubble.

How is this Visa and Google giving over the fact that you bought a sugary drink to an insurance company or a condom to your wife? 
I'm not disputing data collection happening, I'm disputing the absurdity of telling someone that by using Android Pay, they won't get insurance and lose their family in the future. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 14:43:41
I'm assuming no such thing as a matter of fact, hence the (yet). 
I'm basing my statement on the fact that multiple government agencies do not yet share information. If government agencies that are supposedly working together aren't yet sharing information in the same country, it's going to be a long time before Google and Visa share information with insurance companies and your wife. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 13:54:22
Only if that information is shared between the people who do know and those that don't. Insurance companies and your wife don't have access to that information (yet).

Yeah I've been using my Halifax card for a few months now. I tested cashing out a couple of weeks ago and the money was in my account within 2 days.

Anyone have any idea if there's an exchange rate that matches Circle's? I would like to know for my widget so I know if it's worth cashing out. At the moment I have to use Coinbase exchange rate, but Circle add fees to the rate, so it's like £10 more per coin (and £10 less for cash out). 
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:28:46
Awesome. You worried me for a minute there. I've only got 0.2btc at the moment so it's not worth getting one, but I'm sure I'll want one in the future. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:49:14
Same here. I put the "spare change" from my bank account, the stuff I can't draw out at a cash machine, into Bitcoin every week and spend it. I also save money and convert it into Bitcoin to Hodl occasionally. It's a bit of an experiment for me: 
I currently have .2 Bitcoin in savings (just under £100 I paid) and at present the same amount in fiat. At the current prices the Bitcoin I'm Hodling has made about 12%, but my bank account has a .6% interest rate. 
So far Hodling is more profitable than saving but who knows if that will be true long term?  
 
TLDR: I too do both, you're right, stop trying to divide and conquer when both can be true.

I'm using Mycelium and haven't got a hardware Wallet. Are you saying I will need one in the future to use Mycelium? If so, I will be moving away from it ASAP. 
@_date: 2016-10-01 18:14:15
Hehe point number 2 is on point. I started buying Bitcoin with the change in my account, then with my savings (to a separate address, my savings address) then started buying XMR with my change address. 
Then XMR dropped to half the price I bought at. 
I'm glad I left my savings in Bitcoin and got greedy with my spare change.
