Can you fork the source on Github? I've been trying to modify it, but I couldn't get it to compile when I shortened coderoll() to 3 characters.

Could you put up the latest backup of the forum for testers to use, then wipe it out once the bug is found? It would make things a lot faster, and would eliminate variables like server settings and web host that might otherwise be missed.
Also, who is your web host (or datacenter, if you own the server)?

Disable Secure Boot from the settings in Win8, then try booting from the USB drive again. The bootloader only allows booting of signed OSs by default; which, coincidentally, is only Windows.

That's true, but given only low fee transactions, they will select the ones with the highest fees. It is technically their choice whether or not to include any transactions in a block at all, but they prefer to make as much money off fees as possible. If everyone only payed half the generally-accepted fee, then the top fees of those transactions would be included - miners aren't going to go on strike due to lack of payments from transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:07:57
I specifically asked my credit union about it when I created a separate (free) checking account to use for exchanges. They didn't mind, and they even sent me a (handwritten!) card a week later saying something along the lines of "Thanks for opening an account with us, and good luck with the bitcoins!".
Credit unions are awesome.

Happened to me too when I signed up a few weeks ago; Coinbase sent them, but it took a day or so for my bank to show them. 24 hours later, they showed up in my account and verification worked fine, so it could just be that.

Miners don't set the fees, the fees are chosen by the market and, to a lesser extent, Bitcoin's core developers.
Miners always mine the most profitable transactions. If everyone stopped paying fees at once, the miners would simply carry on mining low-fee transactions for the block reward. When the block reward goes down, larger fees may be necessary for the miners to be willing to include the transaction in a block.
The exception to this rule is the mainline "Satoshi" client, where the developers of Bitcoin set a minimum fee. This has nothing to do with the protocol or other clients, but most people accept it as a standard.

I'm not sure how the teacher *could* be liable for this, even if it somehow caused a problem. Any blame would fall on the parents for allowing (or not knowing about) the legal mess, or on the kid for screwing something up.

Anonymity is a powerful thing.
Also, website TOSs aren't legally binding, so as long as they don't have any laws to comply with and/or don't know you're underage, the most they can do is close your account and often not even that.
