Im talking about untreatable bacterial disease. Its rare. There is usually always alternatives in antibiotic selection with your common bacterial disease.

Ya for super rare infections. You will be glad to get a hold if a simple macrolide if you get pneumonia during a collapse.

Ditto on bitcoin. If a major collapse happens we are all gonna be fucked.

Eh your right in a way. Its an easy avenue for people to believe they are gonna make a lot that wish they would have stayed with bitcoin.

Whats the government regulation news?

Putting all your money into just bitcoin is idiotic.

In the real world, no one is going to take bitcoin for their potato crop. Gold and silver will always be acceptable.

See, this is why im hesitant getting started with bitcoin. This sounds like a pain in the ass. TD Ameritrade and banks are easy and insured.

Farmer bob will tell you to fuck off with bitcoin and take someone elses silver or gold.

And thats the double edged sword. I want to get in on it more than the measly $500 I have put into it but the security issues make me hesitant. I like active/swing trading and thats what I want to do with crypto.

Hearing this kind of shit is the exact reason why I haven't invested in crypto yet. At least I'm protected and insured through my bank and broker account.
And like others have said, the average person isn't going to adopt bitcoin until its much much safer.

Thanks for telling me, I don't spend all day on this website like others.
