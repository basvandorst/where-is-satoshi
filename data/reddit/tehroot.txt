Apple ecosystem hallmarks






Google moving towards, Google services integration across all platforms especially across Mobile devices.
Google moving towards centrally distributed and controlled software updates and launch dates. 
Nexus branded hardware under close supervision by Google, I.E., stock and optimized frameworks/firmware. 
How has apple even remotely moved towards a google style ecosystem?

I'm more referring to adoption of the patches. When updates are rolled out across OSX, the patch rate is extremely high compared to all of the Linux distros out there.

It's FAR more likely that jailbreaking exploits are where this kit gains it's entrance rather then the other way around. 
Again, there is no documentation saying Apple is complicit in the exploitation of its own devices.

Panhandling on reddit..this community is just so lol. Get a job like I did, and use your own money. Your parents don't have to give you shit, especially for a speculative currency like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:11:41
No, it's not illegal. It's within the right of a parent unless they're emancipated or 18+. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:48:12
It's essentially virtual panhandling. You have a sob Story and people felt bad for you. They gave you money to make themselves feel better.

Jailbreaking is 100% successful.

The marketplace is far from open. Google regularly shuts down apps that it doesn't deem within the TOS. Sideloading != Marketplace.
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:49:11
In an ideal world yes.

There aren't enough variations to mean anything. 
The kernel hasn't changed tremendously since 4.0 anyway and that's what a majority of devices are running, and with the push for an apple like Android ecosystem by Google, it's not going to exist for long. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:04:34
The manufacturers don't matter because the Android kernel wraps and handles all those services. You don't need drivers like a Windows or Linux machine.

Holy shit the amount of fucking FUD in this thread is ridiculous. 
1.) iPhones are compromised because they can be jailbroken
2.) Android is compromised simply because they can be rooted. 
3.) none of the documents show that companies are complicit. 
4.) Shut the fuck up if all you're going to do is sling buzzwords around and not actually rely on facts.

Participate in any legal activities -&gt; assets seized by government as part of civil forfeiture -&gt; you have no recourse

OSX vulnerabilities are just as reported as Linux vulnerabilities, the only difference being patch time. Adoption of security patches however, is much better across OSX then it will ever be across any Linux distribution. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:38:05
It's forked from the Linux foundation and is handled by google, not by Linus Torvalds. LF has as much to do with Androids development as Xerox has to do with OSX. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:55:55
None of the documents indicate any cooperation from the corporations devices here. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:57:44
No, you're right, you don't have to jailbreak. Although jailbreaking isn't some elite hacking method, it's a simple execution of a p0ison executable. 
You're right to make your own choices about your own devices, I just like to inform people that every "app" marketplace, regardless of it's google, or apple, microsoft or RIM, all remove apps on flimsy pretexts and with no warning. If you believe otherwise you are sadly mistaken. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:39:08
You are also free to use Cydia on iOS since jailbreaking is no longer "illegal". 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:59:04
Or ones that compete with google's services and terms of service, the same as iOS....
Apple can remove whatever app they want because it's part of the App Store TOS. Same with the google play TOS. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:20:30
Again, that doesn't mean anything since basically 95‰ of low cost devices now run Android. 
And the others run meego which isn't any better. Or they run symbian

SIM Attacks are a different ballgame, remote sim exploits are separate from a remote attack on a backdoor in the OS.
The HDD attack is also a known vector for firmware based attacks. 
0-day, again, implies that only the NSA knows about it, and again, nothing implicates Apple or any other tech company for that matter, in being complicit in leaving these holes, and it would have more the likely come to light sooner if the company had deliberately put holes in its products.
