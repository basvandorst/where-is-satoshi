How did he transfer money anonymously to buy the domain? At that time I'm assuming the domain registrar did not accept bitcoin.

How does ebay protect sellers? I'm thinking of selling some items on ebay.  What's to stop a buyer from claiming that the item was damaged or low quality or never arrived or some other false complaint?

Thanks for the info. That's not a FICO score unfortunately.  FICO score is what most lenders use so that's why it's important to get that one.

That came fast.  How long did it take you?

Ah ok thanks. I'm reading the site but where did you see about the credit score for $3.95? Because that's a good price, but only if it's an actual FICO score.

I do wonder whether he used his real name or a fake name to register the domain.  I'm not aware of any domain registrars that would allow one to register something with cash and a fake name.  Recall from the SR investigation one of the reasons the guy got caught was he ordered fake IDs in the mail because the domain registrar required him to send in an ID.

Does this give you free FICO score? Free credit report?  Or does it only alert you if something suspicious happens? Just wondering

If they had the coins, why would they not simply show them?

So where are you now, if you don't mind me asking?
