Have you even looked into other coin's tech? Coins that use dBFT concensus algo can be pushed to 10k TPS on-chain. Add to that a layer two solution and we're talking hundreds, if not thousands of times that amount. If you think bitcoin and only bitcoin has a purpose/is the endgame/is the only one that will or deserves to survive you should definitely reconsider.

I beg to differ. History has shown that pooping is the best way to sit and reflect on one's self, drowning in deep thoughts.

Their main arguement (if we're talking whitepaper) is "a peer2peer digital currency". Meaning outside of the reach of banks, regulations, regulators, governments. Lightning network could indeed give btc the scalability boost it needs (in fact the idea is pretty neat), but "lightning hubs" will have to be registered and regulated with a "money transmitters" license, hence losing the whole peer2peer aspect as govt, banks, regulators, regulations can (and will) target those lightning hub.
On the other end is a big block coin, secured by powerful computers, and the fact that everything is on-chain means there's no "hubs" where banks/govt/regulators can regulate. It stays peer to peer, as intended.
That's all I can say. I don't take sides in the debate, but those are the main facts more or less. In the end, it's either the best coin wins, or they co-exist for different purposes. I don't get why both communities bash eachother so much (nor do I care actually, got better things to do!).

No dude! Lightning network and centralization of miners and bandwidth issues! /kek

To be fair, their whole idea is on chain scaling. So don't delude yourself too much, once/if they reach full 8mb blocks (good for them if they do!), they'll raise it to 16mb, then 32mb, then 64, all the way to 500 or 1G if needed.

In the case of Bitcoin, On-chain transactions are called "Layer 1 transactions". those are transactions going through the blockchain directly. "Layer 2" transactions are transactions that are settled "Off chain" via something being developed by the bitcoin core dev team called the "lightning network". Basically to keep it overly simple as I don't know the exact mechanics: most transactions will be done "off chain", and then confirmed all together as a single tx "on chain". This means hundreds, if not thousands of transactions can be settled off chain via a lightning hub (think of them as a mini-bitcoin-bank, they will be regulated as money transmitters and will need a license), and then be "verified" by the 1st layer by being submitted as a single TX on the blockchain. No definitive ETA on the Lightning network as of yet, as far as I know (someone please correct me if I am wrong).
A good point of comparison would be bitcoin cash, which instead focuses on having bigger blocks, and therefore having ALL transactions settled "on chain", and as the number of transactions grow with time, they simply make the blocks bigger (until they reach something like 1GB blocks, if/when needed).
Both have their pros and cons, which I won't get into. But yes, essentially, every body agrees and knows that BTC is going to be slow until the Lightning Network is implemented

Hedge. If no lightning network (OR lightning network, but with no adoption), rip BTC. Nothing guarantees it'll ever come out/be adopted (nothing guarantees it wont either). That's exactly why you hedge, so whichever way things go you don't get screwed. Unless you have a crystal ball, which, you and I both don't. Both coins have their pros and cons. And forget this whole 'investing with ideological reasons', that's the best way to go broke.

One of japan's first (if not the first) exchange to be fully regulated and licensed. These guys are phenomenal (as a company). Haven't used the exchange itself though. Qash is probably one of the biggest things to happen to crypto, it will bring liquidity to all the markets and a fully regulated/licensed Japanese company is at the forefront of it. This liquidity is much needed as the whole cryptosphere is about to pass the trillion mark.

no, TUSD is. USDT is in the 80 cents range. Only way to get rid of tether is to dump it for any coin you can. Wait until USA wakes up, mass FOMO dumping of tether (and the only way to dump it being buying other coins, you'll see a lot of coins moon at ridiculous levels in USDT). This will come crashing hard
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:15:33
Tether dying, hit 0.8xx USD white TUSD hit 1.2+,
people are dumping their USDT for BTC, ETH, TUSD, and any coin they can get their hands on just to get rid of that worthless tether and be left with something. 300k'ish of buys on kraken vs 3M+ of sells for USDT.
Add all the fomo of other USDT holders (who will all fomo in with market-buys tryna exit tether) and you have yourself a pretty neat reverse flash-crash.

Rip our boii tether &lt;/3

I think a lot are also forgetting that, relating to OP's question, all those "new cryptos" would also all be traded against BTC. This is the one single biggest thing about it, it's the crypto "main currency". See those thousands of coins on MCAP? The one thing they ALL have in common? They trade against BTC.

Oh! I see okay. Id like to do more research on this, do you happen to know any good articles or posts that study block size vs required bandwidth or something of that nature?

Isnt a 500gb hard drive like 20bucks used nowadays? Can't the 'average person' sacrifice going to mcdonalds twice a year to pay for that 20 bucks? Also, don't hard drives become bigger and cheaper every year, and eventually 1TB drives used will be in the 20-30$?

Let me rephrase, they are the best in terms of credit card fees. Exchanges that accept CC are pretty much cexio, and coinbase. They give higher limits right off the bat (so if you're in a rush you can create an account, have your card verified in under an hour, and fund your account with 300USD, 300Euro AND 250GBP, versus coinbase's ridiculous peanuts limit (50-100$?), on top of being cheaper (3.5% versus 4%). So yes in that department they're on point. When it comes to wiring them money, withdrawing by wire, trade fees, etc. I'm honestly clueless as I don't use them for anything other than that. I just assumed the OP was asking about exchanges that accept CC's since he mentioned cexio and CB, pretty much the only two doing it.

Crypto =/= stock market. You want your proof news and politics do influence price? Look at Neo's chart: sharp nosedive when china put a stop to icos. Bitcoin chart? Sharp nosedive on news that china is shutting down exchanges / "Banning" bitcoin.

Hello Joe! Congrats on taking the plunge! I suggest you also check out  you can buy their BLX coin fairly easily. They are like an actively managed fund, each BLX you buy (for let's say.. 2$ each) is actually comprised of a variety of coins in different percentages. By investing in BLX, you are investing in bitcoin, ethereum, as well as a dozen other promising coins, all at once. They are also working on listing it on traditional stock exchanges, and positioning themselves as pioneers building the bridge between the "new" crypto money and the "old school" investor money. This is probably the simplest way to diversify your investment. Good luck!

Apples and oranges. If all of the world was to agree and relied on btc as a store of value like they currently do for gold, market cap would be in the hundred trillion range for bitcoin alone. That's 6 million dollars per btc, and a much, MUCH less volatile bitcoin.

Yes, it's excellent. Im still wondering why people are still bothering with coinbase
