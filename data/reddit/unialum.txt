What about sending the transaction again with a higher fee?

Ahh yes...  I can see where this is a problem.  And honestly, I didn't even consider this.  So if kids can get their hands on BTC, what do you think is the biggest advantage (i.e. why would they want to)?

Yes.  Take a look at [this]( comment from A quick look around will get you other recommendations as well.

I'm so far removed from this age range but I did enjoy your presentation and what you're doing with the donations.  How is your age range accepting BTC?  Do you hear a lot about it through social media?

I finally got my Coinbase account verified (after ~1 week).  It's time to transfer some BTC over for tipping.  Thanks for the reminder!

I agree *as an investment* but as a transfer of money/payment system, use frequently.  I'm pretty conservative with my 1% total investment in Bitcoin and very bullish (at this point) on the long-term.

It's a cool idea but could be extended further.  Currently, it checks the 24 hour weighted price and current price.  If the current price &gt; 24 weighted price, it turns the light green (otherwise red).  One idea would be different hues for prices/percents &lt; 24 hour weighted price?
