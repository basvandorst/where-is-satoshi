What am I looking for here?
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:19:56
I would guess that it is more like 1988 or 1989.

Great video, I like the visual style of it.
Don’t forget to pimp the YouTube too, at the end you don’t mention it. I don’t know how many others do this, but I typically ignore mediums such as Facebook or Instagram. Instead I subscribe to YouTube channels I find helpful.
Personal preference too, I think your background image for the video should look more to match the visual style of the video. I really liked it.

lol clearly not buying enough.

When was this recorded?
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:53:52
I wish I could, but this is carry out only and there are no huts near me. I would try the wich wich first I suppose.

An ounce of gold is roughly $1,266.10 whereas a bitcoin is roughly 5 times that. So while that may not exactly indicate rarity, it does indicate demand. So it appears to me that bitcoin is worth roughly 5 ounces of gold.

How does one pay Pizza Hut with BTC?
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:32:48
Well your not wrong, if you compare a ton of gold to a satoshi then of course gold is worth way more in that comparison. But you are intentionally changing the unit of measurement to fit your point of view. In your or original question you just asked how can one compare the rarity and value of them. I was just letting you know that based on rarity and market demand, the market has currently decided that a bitcoin is roughly worth the same as 5oz of gold.

Yeah! That’s my 313!
@_date: 2019-02-15 01:57:21
But why?
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:07:52
I don’t understand how I use this. The README is also just a one line description.
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:56:17
lol even at a tenth of a cent, that would cost like $27,000! Not a bad deal though.
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:55:36
Thanks for sharing, I would ln tip you, but idk how. :(

What’s KvB? Is it supposed to read 1 sat per KB?
@_date: 2019-04-15 11:46:10
Many older companies are still using old outdated software and systems. They just don’t feel like making updates is a priority or whatever. This is also related to why you hear of so many hacks happening.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:00:45
But what does it all mean?
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:44:12
The worst part is, I still don’t understand the original post.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:35:04
lol I don’t understand why you are so hostile about this. I legit couldn’t discern if your college of news articles were suppose to illustrate the fact that Bitcoin is going to 0, or if the media is trying to suppress price. Pls don’t downvote me, I have no karma to give.

Ledger if you can afford, or Exodus if you do not mind Desktop only.

Oh wow, this is impressive. Thank you for sharing.
Any reason why bitshares.org isn’t listed under exchange or decentralized exchange?

Serious question, what institutional money?
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:44:03
But would they need to even buy any? If a large Corp, say like Amazon, starts accepting bitcoin; then wouldn’t they build up a fairly large supply of coins just by accepting them? No need to invest.

Be sure to post or update with guides and resources used. I am sure many people are interested!

Thank you, you are doing the work of the gods. I suspected it had a negative outlook, good to see sentiment is turning around!
