It's an extra 53gb per year. A 1tb drive currently costs &lt;$50. That's over 9 years of full 2MB block storage.

You don't have to pay $23 to 'pre-fund' your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:30:33
At least. Just like segwit is 'really easy for wallets to implement' and yet the core wallet still doesn't have it.
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:09:00
I like how they try to censor "Inside Bitcoin people" but failed to remove the text behind it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:02:33
IMO these are far better looking than anything else available. (And if you don't like the stock backgrounds, you can submit your own.)

You guys made some detrimental choices on hardware, then. It's sad to find out there's no chance of this changing. 
Did nobody there realize how bad of an idea it would be to make a hardware wallet in a completely closed system?
Specifications are entirely meaningless if you can't see that they're implemented honestly and consistently.

The same information is [visible on BitcoinWisdom](

Did this site ever actually launch? I've been watching this thread hoping for some kind of update.

Why not do something a little more useful for everyone? Make filters user-configurable, and provide your list publicly. Anyone who wishes can then easily opt-in to your list, edit, create their own, etc.
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:13:08
That's not really a "configurable filter", though. That's just the option of turning one specific list of hard-coded patterns on or off. What if I just want to filter SatoshiDICE? It might also be interesting to have inclusion filters, to only keep specific transactions.
I can understand not trying to support all that if you plan on replacing it, though.

The new [microsoul]( coins are only loaded with 0.01.
bitcointalk has a few DIY coin vendors... like [serpcoin]( and [ravenbit]( there might be more in the goods section.
There are also wallet cards, like the previously linked cryptocards, called [bit-cards](

It's been known from the beginning that the only way anyone finds out what they went for is if the winner(s) identify themselves and release that information. It was never going to be public information.

This tool has a massive flaw that results in it skipping the majority of your private keys. 
Are you trying to recover from a hard drive that might have a wallet on it, or are you trying to recover from a wallet file?
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:38:43
Can you explain why you guys are unable to open source this project? The excuse given on your site doesn't make any sense:


Who could you possibly have an NDA with that would prevent you from releasing your own code? Was this project outsourced to yet another company that everyone is expected to blindly trust?

Block chain time stamps aren't required to be accurate.

How are SlowCoin to Bitcoin transactions handled? Does each node need to have a copy of the SlowCoin chain to verify the proof of burn, allowing it to be used on the Bitcoin network again?
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:31:54
Why do you personally get to decide which transactions should be ignored? At best, you're starting an unwinnable game of whack-a-mole. Isn't it trivial for any of these services to adapt to your filters?
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:21:01
How do I know it's going to give that deterministic output 100% of the time? 
What if its just generating a random number to hijack an extremely small percent of transactions and only acts deterministically 99.999% of the time? Or 99.999999% of the time? There's only so much testing an individual can do, and none of it guarantees permanent, consistent behavior.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:46:00
No, it isn't.
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:47:23
So many of these complaints are just people blatantly violating the terms they agreed to and then acting all bewildered when PayPal takes action.
It's pretty simple, they even spelled out exactly what he was doing wrong.
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:28:42
Baseline is great. Bitwallet will also let you add watch addresses.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:51:42
If you look at how Coinbase got shit on after experimenting with XT, it makes perfect sense.

A [Tron-Club]( subscription.
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:21:59
It's just not entirely honest, because it can also redirect a transaction.
@_date: 2016-02-23 21:41:10
Why wouldn't you just fix all of the customers affected? Do you guys expect everyone with this issue to find this reddit comment?

Cool idea, unfortunately doesn't work for any of my vanity address prefixes, despite some of them holding a balance.

Sweet. I ordered some of these on black Friday and have been eagerly awaiting their arrival. Thanks for taking the time to write this up!
They also mention on their site that using an eraser is a good way to get the hologram fragments off, might save your hands on the next one.

Dang, you've pissed away a pretty decent chunk of money by sitting on it. 
First, if you can, I would upgrade the firmware like [this]( or if you have a Raspberry Pi, [this]( 
If you want to use it, you should just be able to download BFGMiner, and point it at your pool of choice.
If you want to sell it, upgraded Jalapenos are going for ~5-600 on ebay.

The list of minted Casascius coins is [actually public]( so you can figure out exactly which one is yours.

If you're looking for that, check out [bit-cards](

If only I had actually clicked this post before ordering! These seem pretty slick, any chance of offering custom logos in the future?
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:45:24
Wow, and I just ordered one of these a few hours ago with funds on them. Scary!

Mining against smaller blocks doesn't increase the odds of finding one.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:34:47
You can do this manually with bitcoind currently, but I believe it's a bit of a pain in the ass. [This]( might help a bit.
A redditor (I believe) has been working on this to make it easier: 
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:04:52
Maybe because it was mined [within six seconds]( of the previous block? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:11:52
The only reason this happened at all was because the previous three blocks were mined by GHash.IO. If you look at the blocks, they're clearly still using a max size of 250k. This pushed more and more transactions down the line until one was mined by a pool with the 1MB limit. 
When several sequential blocks reduce the number of possible transactions by 75%, this could happen at any size limit.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:02:55
Just out of curiosity, why?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:07:52
What should I do in the future if I'd like a custom logo? Add an image to the notes field? 
What are the limits of usable graphics?
I also recommend making a thread in the [bitcointalk marketplace](

Adding to this, address reuse at all is discouraged for many reasons, including this one.

No, you don't. Just download the Blockchain app.
