Segwit wallet works exactly the same as the Bitcoin "legacy" wallet.
[If you click on "I don't know", your legacy Bitcoin wallet will open by default.]( - Zendesk
SEGWIT is a branch of Bitcoin blockchain released in August 24th 2017. This branch was created to:
* optimize signature delay, up to 60% time
* save on fees on each transaction
For instance using a Segwit address is definitely recommended if you plan to collect small transactions such as mining rewards. But it can also be used for any kind of transactions, and/or for all your transactions.

Isn't the LTC a completely different wallet?  Or are you saying the Ledger wallet make you choose between LTC classic and LTC Segwit as well?

Still relevant!

This statement has no basis in reality.  If you want the value to increase, you want the blockchain and its usage to grow.  Segwit facilitates that.

Sorry, you're several steps ahead of me already.  
Can I use an app on my phone to make the purchase?
Which one is the most secure and safe?  
Do I have to move it to a wallet after that?  
How do I keep it secure? 
To me a fiat is a car.  Thanks!

Remember to only invest what you can afford.  With Bitcoin, plan on not being able to access it again for a long time.  So as to get the greatest benefit.
