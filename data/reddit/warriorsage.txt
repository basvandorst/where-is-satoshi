After Bitcoin started pumping a lot of greedy fools have joined in so basically it's not the same people as it was earlier.
Most of the new guys(who joined less than a year ago) are just here for the money. It's sad that these people don't even know how a blockchain works but still they are in all the way...

Thanks Bro

I was talking about a situation where there is no proof of work protocol.
Redoing the proof of work for each block will not be possible as the the proof of work protocol of Bitcoin for example ensures that it takes 10 minutes for calculation of the proof of work 
And a person cannot alter the data in a old block as the Blockchain data is innumerable
So how does this parallel Blockchain arise is it same as a hard fork

Screw the SEC. 
What we want is Crypto Independence

Yeah that's a really good video

Ok so if I have successful tampered a block and executed a 51% attack then I need to mine all the blocks again on top of the alterd block and make the tampered chain longer by mining more blocks right to get it accepted as valid Right?

This is the only question my friends ask now..
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:00:25
Yep 
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:18:45
So if I was able to execute a 51% attack after altering the block how can I  make all the other block valid.
Or is it like even if  someone has control over 51% of the network can't alter a block

My confusion started when I watched this video.
The guys says that if there are 3 blocks 1, 2, 3 and if a attacker tampers with block 2 it will cause the 3rd block to be invalid and then he talks about how hashing is not enough to protect the network.
So tampering previous blocks is not possible
Ok so if I tamper the current block then I need to be ahead of the other miners and mine more blocks(do more work) to get my tampered block accepted as valid right.

Can you explain the hash of the block function 
And how accurate is the information in this pic
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:41:12
The difficulty as of Apr 27 2018 is 4,022,059,196,164.
I didn't understand the longest chain part
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:49:45


I did not understand the most work done part
What work are you referring to here, is it the proof of work or just calculating the hashes

This was meant as a joke and the list only follows the order of craziness.
I am not ranking the options
