@_date: 2019-02-25 11:51:30
Most garbage article I have read in a long time. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:24:20
It’s not FIAT that fucked up, it’s your believe bitcoins
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:17:20
Point is, with a dying earth we can’t have a currency that takes a lot of power 
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:27:32
Don’t respond, it’s an alt-right troll
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:27:53

@_date: 2019-02-06 11:22:58
Because they trade FIAT? What the hell is wrong with you
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:56:52

@_date: 2019-12-15 17:24:16
So the banks owe money to who?
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:58:53
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:26:33
You’re REALLY missing the point
@_date: 2019-04-17 04:55:47
Because it’s too superior for you? Future proofing baby
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:35:06
Bitcoin, a hard money? It’s a troll isn’t it
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:02:42
I actually didn’t invest in bitcoin. But trust in a currency goes a long way into making it viable.
@_date: 2018-11-11 04:29:09
r/untrustworthypoptarts 
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:37:39
It showed how unstable it was. I know I wouldn’t invest in a currency that loose 16k in a few months. Also, it has not gone up in quite a bit of time already. Context matters 
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:30:01
So you are telling me that millions of people running power hungry ASICS and even some with entire farm of thousands of gpus don’t affect the environnement. Is this a sect movement or what? Meanwhile, actual research has been done and it’s currently over 2 megatons of CO2 each year
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:06:45
@_date: 2019-01-13 13:27:57
Be gone heretic
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:17:00
They don’t really accept bitcoin, it goes through an intermediary and the end result is USD for them
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:13:54
Your explanations isn’t very clear. You mean that by selling ASICs they increased the difficulty? And also creating a pool is not centralization 
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:44:10
Lol wtf. If there is a global financial crisis your crypto currency isn’t worth shit. Physical currency such as gold would be the most sparred 
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:25:02
Create your own thread holy shit
@_date: 2019-01-09 12:58:56
Wow encouraging vandalism 
@_date: 2019-09-29 20:52:56
N-word pass?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:16:35
Wait 2 days and see
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:12:38
Hopefully it never will
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:47:58
Oh stop it with this zoom out crap
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:00:10
It’s not normal fluctuation holy shit
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:57:19
We both know Trump is pro bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:39:30
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:58:33
Look at the trend, it's going down, fast
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:04:21
You didn’t have to bring gun rights in this 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:15:55
If the the graphs are anything to go by it’s not
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:31:02
Yea let’s just zoom out the 1 year where it has been free falling. You could get even better results with Bitconnect
