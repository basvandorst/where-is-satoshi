can you purchase anything less than 1 bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:15:01
let's say price goes up 10% first day.. but from that day on.. it's only going up for the near future.
I'm actually planning on putting in 200 bucks right now.. just to feel the market a bit
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:12:20
So.. the question i actually had.. was that after buying let's say 1 bitcoin from coinbase.com i now want to sell it.. and rake in the profit i made.. how would i go around doing that.
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:39:45
yeah im actually waiting for those exact dates.. as soon as news hits (if it's good) ill look to purchase.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:37:01
oh.. i'm stupid. haha
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:57:47
yeah my take on it so far is this.. if i put in 200 bucks right now... and then wait for Jan 31st.. then at most.. i might lose.. 150 something bucks.. BUT.. if it's good news.. the value could triple overnight.. the gains could be exponential
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:24:47
thinking about later today.. maybe tomorrow but soon yes.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:37:37
just a curious question.. are you yourself invested in bitcoins? (maybe i could ask some questions to clarify myself up if need be)
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:41:20
that's a pretty good point.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:27:12
It's not that i'm afraid to lose... i could lose my entire life savings (im only 20) and not bad an eye.. im not the type to get depressed or feel down in the worst of situations.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:36:44
I think i understand the underlying ideas but not keywords.. also i'm not planning on going all in right away.. i'm going to wait until atleast january 30th (chinese deadline) and keep researching and look into it in more detail and make an informed decision :)
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:35:30
true.. I want to research and observe the stock until atleast january 30th before i buy in.. can you maybe link me to some good sites to research and follow news on bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:29:17
That's why i'm planning on researching atleast a month see it's validity .. and trust me.. as a 20 year old.. losing the 2-3 grand i've saved up wouldn't really be the end of the world for me.. I have a job.. i am going to college.. and i still have my parents :)
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:22:35
Oh.. well i definitely do look to prepare myself and get a feel for it before throwing in my money into it haha.
As of right now.. i'm looking to invest the 2-3 grand in the best investment i can currently find.

Thanks! I really appreciate you helping out a random stranger.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:15:37
do you think i should wait for a new dip or a some big announcement like the singapore one to buy in??
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:28:25
Ok.. see this.. what do you mean "fiat"
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:41:38
