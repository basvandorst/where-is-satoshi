ITT: basement dwellers meet nightclub junkies. Lots of confusion.

Duh. With Dogecoin.

- Which exchange do you advise to start with, for execution (easiest to implement authentication, least execution issues)? Or are you advising some broker?
- Where from do you pull the data for backtesting?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:33:28
Thanks for the tips. I'll implement a simple bot soon. Python 3. The roadmap includes backtesting and multiple currencies and exchanges, but I'll start looking at Kraken first. Feel free to PM me if you're interested in joining forces.

You could ask a programmer from to set up something for you!
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:38:52
Thanks for sharing those, that's encouraging.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:18:33
Maybe, but that's not too much on topic.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:21:54


That's the point, we are discovering how systematically deflationary currencies work, and I do not find it currently good to help give opportunities to rise to those with skills but no fiat money.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:51:45
Right, individually, this is the solution, but over a population, people offer to do what they know how to do; you can't expect a population to be entrepreneurial, and the btc market currently doesn't seem to want that, thus my concern.
Thanks for chiming in.
@_date: 2013-02-15 01:08:29
Thank you, that's very kind of you, and I'm working on understanding bitcointip :)
@_date: 2013-02-15 01:09:33
Ok, that clear my doubts, nice. Thanks.

Curiously, Snd/Rcv when both parties are located in Thailand is not explicitly prohibited.
@_date: 2013-02-15 05:42:41
Thanks for your generosity, hardleft121 :)

I have let it run some time with no funds and haven't yet got that error. Given that it's a 502, for now I'll assume either a server-side problem or a connectivity issue. So, I'll go ahead and just catch that error re-try 5 times before making the program give up. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:12:30
What I mean is that I observe few person-to-person trades outside of currency exchanges, with many "sales" going unfulfilled. There is a big demand from people wanting in, but it's getting harder to get bitcoins without buying them. Sure, you can get a "btc faucet-like" income stream and get a mBTC, but that is not the level of investment I have in mind. 
What are the stats on your market? Like the distribution of time-to-sale, progression of number of unsold items? Or don't you see any evidence of the difficulties to sell in BTC that I observe?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:47:37
Look for the [Hiring] tag in @_date: 2013-11-18 15:36:45
Well, that does sound plausible. Anyhow, I guess we probably can't avoid some less desirable situations in the beginning. 
Thanks for your view, and for discussing my topic :)
@_date: 2013-03-14 20:18:08
I've pushed a fix, you need to try it live and tell me if it works.
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:06:22
I'll check that out, thanks for that tip! 
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:54:12
I have pushed a fix where it retries on 502 till it succeeds, see if it helps you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:17:12
Thanks for your generosity. I have almost 1 btc already, I am in :) 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:22:25
Nope, I know it's not the point. Just pointing out something I find a little sad.
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:57:54
Hey! It's almost like that! You can buy ~0.6 for 100! :D
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:20:11
I specifically want to highlight that people could make more than mBTC if they could effectively sell their services and goods for BTC, but that in reality, there is no one buying. That worries me wrt inequality.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:52:28
Lucky :)! Thank you vbenes. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 01:17:22
Thanks, I'm working on a long passphrase. Not as easy as it seems.
@_date: 2013-03-14 22:25:21
Hey, I just noticed your transfer. Thanks much, I'll use those for live testing in the future. Also, you are now a collaborator on Github, it will be easier.
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:57:12
Troll. Please stop.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:36:00
True, I didn't think of it that way.
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:01:25
I've pushed code to prevent empty transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:32:36
Apologies if I offended you. I mean not to criticise Bitcoin. Just assess (with more feedback from people) whether a problem that I suspect exists. 
Congratulations on your spending. Although your behaviour is commendable, I am less interested in individual examples, and more in statistics.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:27:36
Yeah, it doesn't solve inequality, of course, but I'm afraid it immediately makes it worse, in fact, as I try to explain in the post. 
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:07:27
Thanks you! I'll follow that thread.
@_date: 2013-02-15 01:15:28
OK! That clears things up.
