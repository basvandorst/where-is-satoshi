You weren't in Detroit in 2008..  shit was basically MadMax

So then those who jumped to crypto first in that country now have wealth- then what? Do they leave that country (look what happens when people in impoverished Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago)? Do they become the new overlords (what reason do you have to believe they are less greedy, corrupt, etc)? 
So power shifts to the few people who now have crypto wealth... But how does it stabilize?
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:53:17
Yes, those people do exist. I am not saying all. But majority in a 3rd world country do not. You're aweful fortunate, as am I.

That isn't true. Other places just pay the fee for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:18:50
So you are in a third world country... You have no disposable income, you hardly have power or a roof over your head, but you expect a person to put money into a speculative like btc and hodl? 
Have you ever had to provide for a family? Have you ever wondered when you would be able to eat your next meal? Investing in ANYTHING is out of the question at that point.

Almost anything if the market has been getting 10-30% growth all year. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:02:01
No, they just pay your fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:57:44
And in 3 months that was a $3000 switch. gz
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:21:24
So consider this marketing. A bunch of users switch to gdax cause no fees... But they can flip that switch any time. 
Just be careful saying "no fees" as it may mislead some into being fleeced later. 
Not that it matters cause never sell/transfer only hodl

What? You don't pay tax until you realize a gain or loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:40:44
Believe it or not there are still parts of this world where they actually make their next meal from their hands or barter for it from the goods or services they produce. 
You are still not thinking of how bleak the majority of people current living situation is... You do understand Fiat money system concerns is far from the minds of those in 3rd world countries.

They are in for profit not killing institutions.

Houses are different than cryptos.

This is a real problem for a system that was supposed to redistribute wealth- currently 1% of people own btc... That means only a powerful 1% will remain even under the "new paradigm". 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:38:19
Then why not just pay cash for it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:47:05
.1% of the population already use it... We can already start a revolution against the 99.9%.. we are 300
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:12:54
You're believing lie  comparing it to stock market. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:59:14
That's true. I didn't understand the premise of question. My apologies. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:29:54
Next meal vs. exiting Fiat.. I'm gonna get my next meal for my family. Sorry

Said this just so he can tell his class "told ya..." At his 10 year reunion. As he drives off in his $100k car.
