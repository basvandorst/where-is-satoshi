Adding onto this,
Your public **address** is a (one-way) hash of your **public key** which in turn is derived by hashing your **private key** with a few algorithms in a specific order.
A hash function is a one-way mathematical operation.
Given a hash function HASH() and an input X, you can easily calculate
Y = HASH(X), but you can never find X if you only know Y.

The difference is that in one case you are paying your income tax rate (for me that's 25%) plus the capital gains when you spend it later while in the other you are paying capital gains tax, which for me would be 15% (I would obviously hold for &gt; 1 yr).

No, we don't like them because they inflate currency and play with our money on risky markets.


I think we've seen above that 98% of it's value is speculative. 98% is not that different from 100%, and don't forget that Bitcoin has certain intrinsic value, or at least you'd call it intrinsic. For only 1 satoshi you can secure [proof of existence of a digital document]( create a digital contract, and do a myriad of other not-yet-invented actions.
An important one is that you can sign a message proving that an address is under your control, for instance to prove fund availability or proof of ownership if you paid for a certain unique item.
Did you know that ASICMiner shares (the big mining company and hardware manufacturer) are tied to Bitcoin addresses, and those addresses both own shares and receive dividends?

Here's the gist:
Bitcoin supports M of N signatures.
Escrow application: buyer, seller and escrow service each have 1 part of 3. 2 parts are required to release the money. If everything is smooth, the escrow service doesn't need to do anything. If there is a conflict, escrow will decide who is right and release the money to ether the buyer or the seller.
This way, escrow can never run away with the money.

So you are worried that the block reward is too high? 
Check out the table on this page: 
By 2021, the block reward will be 6.25 BTC, and by 2032 it will be 0.78 BTC per block.
Thanks to free market mechanisms, the network hashrate will always be just below electrical profitability simply because some people do not pay for electricity.
Assuming that Bitcoin takes off, thousands of transactions a second will be enough for mining to be both profitable and secure. If Bitcoin doesn't take off... well, I'm not sure this is worth discussing.

There's a whole philosophy about this. Direct action vs indirect action.
Direct action is something that depends only on you personally, no one else. You can do a direct action any time without involving anyone else. The outcome is direct and clearly visible.
Indirect action requires other people to change - changing laws, customs, getting other people to do what you want - that is much much harder. Usually it isn't worth the time and effort you put into it because the outcome is immeasurably small.

Ah, the beauty of cryptography. That's what a hash function does. 
For a hash function H(), let X be the input and Y be the output, so Y = H(X).
A hash function is a one way function: you can very very easily calculate Y if you have X, but you cannot calculate X if you have Y.
What miners do is basically bruteforce the address space until they find a Y that fits the rules (specifically, Y must be lower than current mining difficulty) by repeatedly trying H(hash_of_previous_block + hash_of_transactions_in_new_block + random_integer).
That's the "work".
Checking that the work is correct is trivial, because hash of previous block is public info, hashing all transactions that were propagated with the block is trivial, and the random integer (aka nonce) is conveniently included so that the client can easily check the miner's work.

Pffft. Assuming this is your first reddit account, you haven't seen nothing yet, youngling.
What you are seeing is the following phenomenon: 
Over time, as popularity of reddit grew, the audience became dumber and dumber. Groupthink was not as strong back in the day...
The same is happening with the Bitcoin subreddit.
As for investing your IRA, it's a nice option to have, especially if you aren't planning on leaving your money in Bitcoin forever. If young and risk averse, a person can invest a portion of their retirement savings into Bitcoin just for a little while, and if that little while happens during another exponential growth leg, you've just made sure you'll do just fine after 65.

Look, this all stems from personal property. Your *personal* property is sort of like a part of your *person*.
When someone demands a part of your person under the threat of violence, that's extortion. When you demand that your person and property be left alone, that's self defense.
Everyone has the exact same rights as everyone else - to life, liberty and property.
Now, the universe is a state machine, and if it so happens that during state N-1 your ancestor owned some property, during state N that property will likely be owned by you, unless you decide to exchange it for goods or services (or tokens of value).
Yes, life is not fair. If you didn't inherit anything, you will need to work hard to produce enough value to purchase property.
For what it's worth, before you accuse me of being "privileged", I am a son of first-generation immigrants to the US who had all of $11k when they set foot on this land less than 15 years ago. They now own two apartments, have put me through college and have done that with no handouts from government (we didn't even qualify for food stamps due to our quirky immigration status).

The risk is when the money you've gotten by keeping your computer powered on a few years ago (aka paying $15 more a month for electricity) is now worth $20k.
You are risking $20k when you decide not to sell your 1000 BTC for $20 a piece. You are risking $1.2mm when you decide against selling your 1000 BTC for $1200 a piece.
The method of acquisition is irrelevant because the only thing you need to assess is the **current situation**. The current situation is the only thing that matters.

Of course it will, and your big question is whether transaction fee saturation will be enough to pay a saturated miner market - which it will regardless due to the self-adjusting nature of the network and added incentive to mine at a loss in case you own a significant stake.

More like Ancient Roman law. As in, we respect it because we as society agreed on the concept of personal property, stemming from the concept of natural rights. Furthermore, even if some people do not agree with the concept of personal property, that wouldn't cancel the other individuals' concept of personal property.


It is theft because it uses threats of violence and/or violence itself in order to extract value.
Locking a geographic area for exclusive personal use isn't something unique to humans - look at the animal kingdom for references. It also doesn't extract value from anyone, it simply bars non-members from entry/use.

There are two ways to effect change you wish to see. Direct action, and indirect action. 
Indirect action requires the consent and/or cooperation of others, and is thus very difficult to achieve. Voting is an example of indirect action.
Direct action requires nothing but your personal action - there is no one to convince or argue with, just yourself. Switching to an alternative currency as means of effecting change is an example of direct action.

?? What do you mean "registered"? You can't register, there's no registration.
GHash is not bad, it's just that no one pool should control such a big portion of the network: 
This becomes especially dangerous if a single pool is able to outpace all the rest of the network (aka 51% attack).
Miner verify transactions and create blocks. If a single entity can create blocks faster than the rest of the network combined, that entity could control what transaction go into the blockchain and block specific transactions from ever being recorded - because they are able to create blocks faster than everyone else.

Why not both? I am planning on hedging with fiat and later metals as bitcoin rises. 
Face it, it could be replaced by an alternative that solves the block size, bandwidth and storage issues. 7 transactions per second is just not good enough for prime time. 
My hope is that eventually Bitcoin will be optimized to the point that this isn't an issue and you could include millions of transactions in a block. And that this happens before a better alternative comes along.

It's all math. My bitcoin-qt client checks every transaction of an incoming block to verify it conforms to network rules. If the block contains an invalid transaction (say, coinbase transaction gives 50 BTC instead of 25 BTC to finder), the block won't be propagated and built upon by other miners.

That's a problem with the banks, not with Bitcoin. Use cash.




You must be confused. Russian government can tell you not to deal with Bitcoin, but it can't actually stop you. That's the beauty of it.
A third-party system is *nice to have* if your government and banking system is semi-sane (like Germany), but Bitcoin enables you to use electronic money without consent of any form of authority in case of oppression.
I'll summarize it for you, maybe it'll get through.
1. If political situation allows, escrow services (and perhaps insured wallets) are provided by third party service, which addresses your reversibility issues.
2. If this isn't the case, you can always fall back to pure bare Bitcoin that is unstoppable (and irreversible).

Calculating hashes proves that you randomly guessed one of the correct answers to the current puzzle and that you've done the work needed to verify transactions.
Mining bundles transactions into blocks and those blocks become "canon" transaction history shared by the entire network.

No, you need an escrow service with 2-of-3 signature address.
It's a simple scheme really. To finalize the transaction, the transaction must be signed by two of three keys. Each party (including the arbiter) has a key.
If buyer and seller have no dispute, there is no need to involve the arbiter (both buyer and seller have a key, which makes 2 keys).
If seller never shipped product and arbiter sides with buyer, arbiter and buyer combine their keys to refund.
If seller ships product, buyer tries to scam seller and seller has proof, arbiter sides with seller.
Main points:
* arbiter never ever holds the money - he would need either the buyer or the seller to help him out to steal money (like Paypal)
* arbiter doesn't need to be involved if everything is smooth. In theory this means that arbiter only takes a fee if intervention is required, cutting down cost.

You can just divide it up further.

It's much tougher to rob you of properly stored bitcoin than it is to rob you of cash under your mattress. It's not like your bitcoin stash will bulge under the mattress. If you're really paranoid, you can quite literally store Bitcoin in your mind. 


I am advocating the Freedom that Bitcoin provides. Bitcoin doesn't care whether your puny little jurisdiction considers it legal or not - it exists outside of the physical realm, outside of any boundaries, completely within the domain of SHA256.
I don't think you can come up with a moral argument that isn't full of fallacies that would allow you to rationalize making bitcoin illegal.
Therefore, illegal use of bitcoin in countries where the government is working against the peoples' interests is just fine in my book.
To make it easier, you don't support Jim Crow laws, do you? Or segregation? You wouldn't support upholding the law *just because it's the law*, would you?

Right, but to get the payment system you also need to use the protocol. Bitcoin the payment system has bitcoin the accounting unit, PayPal the payment system has USD. 
You cannot directly compare PayPal leveraging the existing system to Bitcoin building everything from the ground up.

The risk changes with every re-evaluation of bitcoin price, with every trade. 
If you have 100 BTC right now, it does not matter whether you mined them on your laptop in 2009 or bought them yesterday - your cost basis is irrelevant to your current risk. 
What you have is 100 BTC and you must make a choice - to keep or sell.

Ah, but OTHER governments also want a reserve currency that isn't controlled by a central authority - they'd like a transition to their own currency as the reserve one, of course, but lacking that, the new digital gold will do I think.

Whether this new digital gold will be Bitcoin or something else, time will tell.

How is that possible? You are supposed to pay your income tax rate (say 25%) on capital gains if held for less than 1 year.
If BTC costs $1000/BTC, and if you spend $100 in BTC and you acquired BTC at $10 in january 2013, you owe tax on $99 of capital gains, which is $24.75 assuming a 25% rate.

Uh that isn't how it works. The miners depend on the clients to accept and propagate their blocks.

You don't need companies. 
You can go buy bitcoin from an actual person in a face to face transaction, have the seller send it to an address you own (aka have the private key for), and you're done. 
You do not need to trust any company to generate a Bitcoin address - you can do it with a pen if you like (warning, quite tedious) or more regularly with a Bitcoin client such as Electrum.
The problem with this is that you're personally responsible for safekeeping of your private keys. If anyone ever gets access to them, they can spend your Bitcoin. 
So people try to offload the responsibility to a company, but as of yet no company exists that offers insurance. Circle might be the first.

I'll quote the whitepaper:


Privacy  
The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.  
**As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.**

Of course it's growing super exponentially - the niche isn't full yet. This is like dropping 10 bacteria into a bowl of food with a constant supply. They will grow exponentially and eventually collapse back to fit the constant supply.
Unlike with bacteria, Bitcoin prevents a hashrate collapse by weaning miners off of the block reward gradually, settling instead for miner shock roughly every 4 years until mining rewards become negligible compared to accumulating transaction fees.

Hey, corrupt officials will be corrupt officials until they get hung up to dry or die of natural causes. 
If they can kickstart another bubble leading to total market cap that is an order of magnitude higher than now, great, because that finally enables the "serious" investors to come in and play. 
Of course, I do have a selfish motive to root for price increase - I'm holding coins, but that's not all.

That happens when they merge back.
When they do, one branch of the fork is invalidated, and assuming US has more hashpower, all EU transactions are suddenly unconfirmed and have to be included in blocks again. It'll work fine if there weren't double spends, but it'll be pretty bad if there were indeed doublespends that subsequently break a lot of EU transactions.

You see, with Bitcoin, one has a choice. 
People like you will elect to use bank services for safe storage. With that, however, you lose a few important properties of Bitcoin - for instance, the bank can now control your spending and can tell you that "sorry, you can't withdraw because your account is pending investigation".

When you exchange 12 chickens for a goat, you are supposed to pay income tax from the goat income that you just received. The other party is also supposed to pay income tax on the 12 chicken income. Obviously, the US Government only accepts USD, so you have to somehow extract USD from your ass and pay them. 
If you bought some BTC at $10 each and you're spending $100 worth of BTC on overstock when BTC is $1000, you owe capital gains tax on $99 of gains.
Yay for extortion, especially when the government had absolutely nothing to do with it.

So even though you are able to sell your asset for $X while you have invested $Z, you still think you're only risking $Z? Why are you not taking into account that you can exchange your asset for $X, where $X is noticeably larger than $Z?
Followup question: Are you including your investments into your net worth calculation? If yes, you are risking current worth. If not, I don't think you know what you are doing.
Edit: Secondary followup question:
If you have invested $Z and your investment is worth $Y today, where $Y &lt; $Z, are you still risking $Z?

A transaction is instant. A "confirmation" occurs when that transaction is included in a block. The average time from one block to the next is 10 minutes, however it's a probability distribution and there have been times where 4 blocks were mined in a single minute, and there have been times when blocks were spaced an hour apart.
For small transactions such as pizza or coffee it does not make sense to wait for a confirmation as the amount of capital one needs to invest in order to double-spend the money is absolutely incomparable, as one would need to control &gt; 51% of the computing power of the whole network.

There are no incorrect addresses. You cannot send money to an invalid address, each address has a checksum embedded ensuring that it's a valid address.
Now, if you send money to an address that no one has the private key to... well, nobody will ever be able to send money from that address.

Basically, you have Armory in offline mode on the netbook and Armory in online mode on a networked computer. The online Armory will need Bitcoin-QT and the full blockchain to function (and 4 GB of ram due to some inefficiencies due to be fixed in the next release).
The online Armory has a watch-only version of your offline wallet (no private keys). When you want to spend some money from your offline wallet, you will have to
1) Create an unsigned transaction on your online computer
2) Transfer that transaction to your offline computer (USB stick or QR code, or whatever other method you like)
3) Sign transaction with private keys on your offline computer
4) Transfer the signed transaction back to the online computer and broadcast it to the network
This way your private keys never ever touch the internet and there is no possible way for someone to swipe them from you.

Do you understand the word "divisibility"?
We can currently subdivide a bitcoin to 100,000,000 units (satoshis). This can be further extended to allow subdivision to 100,000,000,000 units (you can have an arbitrary divisibility, 100,000,000,000,000,000 is not an issue) in the future if need be.
This way if there is only 1 whole bitcoin left accessible in the whole universe, it would still be enough. And if there is 1 satoshi left in the whole universe - it's still enough.

Then person B deposits his 9 BTC into the bank, of which the bank lends 8.1 BTC out to person C and keeps 0.9 BTC (10% of the deposit) in the vault.
So now the bank has a total of 1.1 BTC in the vault, and has lent out 17.1 BTC.
A has 10 BTC in his bank account, B has 9 BTC in his bank account.
Total: 19 + 17.1 = 36.1 BTC, of which 17.1 BTC doesn't really exist.

Miners ARE transaction verifiers - they verify the transaction and include it in a new block.
Regular nodes also verify each and every transaction that comes their way, and they don't forward it to their peers if it's invalid.
So you can help the network just by running a full node.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:39:14
There is currently no way to differentiate where the coins come from in any default client - you would need to analyze the blockchain to determine that.
Building colored coin support into clients will allow the government to skip that extra hard and time consuming step and just say "all coins passing through the following list of addresses are now black and illegal to accept", at which point the clients will be modified into automatically rejecting the black coins due to pressure from the "authorities". In the end, the maintainers of the default client are real people whose names are known, and they could be pressured.

Okay so apparently Discus Fish is some known Chinese bitcoiner:  (Use google translate, it's a chat log)
Not sure what his relation to this pool is, but this is definitely some pool judging by the outgoing transactions from the mining address. One that's been active since May 9, 2013.

1. The problem is that whenever a new block appears it has to be accounted for in the hash calculation for the next block. Which means whenever a new block appears, work on the next block starts completely from scratch. More info:

Newly minted coins need 100 confirmations to be spent. ~~(I couldn't find a source for this but this is what I remember from back in the day when I used to mine)~~ Nevermind, found source: it's 100 for network confirmation and 120 to show up in original client. [src](
You can create a transaction when the newly minted coins have &lt; 100 confirms without an issue, it just won't get into a block until it has 100 confirmations, **which is exactly what we are waiting on**.
And this has absolutely *n o t h i n g* to do with solo mining.

The orders go in a queue. If you send orders faster than the queue moves, the queue builds up. They were sending thousands of 0.01BTC trades a second, and built the queue up to 1 HOUR of being backed up.

I tried that yesterday. Both Armory and Bitcoin-QT. Bitcoin-QT errors out while trying to create the transaction (too many unspent outputs I guess).
Armory behaves quite strangely - freezes for ~40 seconds, then 1-2 seconds you can actually touch the GUI. Then back to freezing.
Other clients are garbage, can't even import a private key.
So it looks like the only way to get anything out of that address is by hand crafting transactions.

I did, however, find this: 
Still, this is only ECDSA, which means that **if** this is indeed proven **and** there exists a feasible practical attack, you should refrain from reusing keys that you have sent from even once.
From paper:


At ASIACRYPT 2012, Petit and Quisquater suggested that there 
may be a subexponential-time index-calculus type algorithm for the Elliptic 
Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) in characteristic two  elds. This 
algorithm uses Semaev polynomials and Weil Descent to create a system of polynomial equations that subsequently is to be solved with Grobner basis methods.
Its analysis is based on heuristic assumptions on the performance of Grobner basis methods in this particular setting. While the subexponential behaviour would 
manifest itself only far beyond the cryptographically interesting range, this result, if correct, would still be extremely remarkable.


Further research, both experimentally and theoretically is needed to determine the true
complexity of the ECDLP index calculus method based on Semaev polynomials, Weil
descent and Grobner basis methods!

For those who can't see behind the wall:
Bitcoin has come on to the radar of the UK government, with officials gathering in London on Monday to discuss the security threats and tax concerns posed by the digital currency.  
About 50 civil servants from HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, Home Office and GCHQ – the intelligence listening service – held a one-day conference which examined how Bitcoin works and how criminals might seek to exploit the electronic cash system, which is currently unregulated by any financial authority.  
  
The meeting, entitled The Future of Money, focused on the implications that widespread adoption of the currency might have. As Bitcoin users are anonymous, authorities worry that it could be used for purposes such as money laundering, and that transactions between individuals fall outside boundaries of tax collection.  
The Revenue said its attendance at the conference had been to further its understanding of “current tax-related issues” and that it was monitoring the development of the Bitcoin market. “The tax system already deals with transactions in currencies other than sterling,” the Revenue said. “Any such transaction will be potentially taxable.”  
Also under consideration was the idea of creating a regulated exchange, which would be the world’s first. Such an entity would go some way to addressing concerns about criminality by requiring users to provide proof of identity. An unregulated exchange was set up in London in 2011 but closed a year later after its bank account was shut down.  
The Future of Money conference, which included presentations on how the cryptocurrency works, was organised by the government’s Foresight Horizon Scanning Centre, an arm of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills which develops innovative, long-term policy. Although unofficial meetings have been held previously, this was the first official meeting of civil servants held to discuss Bitcoin. No government ministers were present.  
Michael Parsons, a banking management consultant and chartered accountant who presented at the event, said: “There were a lot of questions. Everyone was very receptive and keen to learn more.”  
  
GCHQ confirmed that it had sent staff to the conference in the interests of its role in helping to deliver cyber security.  
Civil servants will now prepare two reports for ministers on their conclusions: one public and one private.  
The decision to examine Bitcoin follows similar moves by authorities in the US. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a US financial regulator, said last week that they were exploring how they might regulate Bitcoin and protect markets and consumers. Last year the European Central Bank produced a report on virtual currencies, highlighting the challenge they pose in extending oversight and their threat to central bank control of the financial system. As well as attracting investors, Bitcoin’s advocates include technology fans and libertarians who champion its decentralised nature.  
The price of Bitcoins soared last month, as speculators rushed to invest. It then fell sharply, partly due to hacking attacks at exchanges such as MTGox and on users’ online wallets, which undermined confidence in the four-year-old currency.  
The price has stabilised at about $110 and the present market capitalisation of the Bitcoin economy is estimated at $1.25bn.  
As a payments system, Bitcoin’s attraction is that users can transfer money directly to each other, thus avoiding middlemen and making the cost of transactions virtually nil. In recent weeks businesses using Bitcoin in the US and Canada have had their bank accounts shut, pointing to nervousness by the banks about the rise of the digital currency.

Sure, but current hashrate is not why I am buying.
I am buying 0.000025% of total future mining when I purchase a share, assuming ASICMINER stick with their 'minimum 10% total hashrate' promise.
That's 21m-11.275m = 9725000 bitcoins to be mined (not counting transactions fees). 
At 10%, 972500/400000 = 2.43125 BTC to be earned per share. Just from mining. No hardware, no transaction fees. 
Furthermore, [98.4% of all bitcoins will have been mined by 2028]( so the wait is not even that long.

I don't know, actually. I think ASICMINER will stay competitive - they have a huge first-on-the-market advantage which got them profits which let them make better hardware. Their next stage is 55nm hardware (down from 135 nm ancient tech) due out in November, after which they will probably go smaller.

Because currency is an agreed upon medium of exchange. Which is what bitcoin is - it's nothing else but a medium of exchange and a store of value. The lack of a central bank does not magically make it not a currency, and neither does the volatility (which will obviously decrease with wider adoption).
Bitcoin has intrinsic value in that the network allows to digitally transfer value between individuals without anyone standing in between - no government or bank can tell you "no". For this reason bitcoin will never fall to $0, even if it's ONLY used on Silk Road.
Let me also note that it is incredibly dumb to compare a currency in its infancy (4 years old) to established government currencies. Talk about it when it becomes even remotely comparable, and it isn't right now.

Like I mentioned previously, I tried rebroadcasting your transaction from my home node, but my home node has already seen it so I got error -22, which means "I've already seen this".
You want to get this: 
Then you want to broadcast it from a node that is well-connected and hasn't seen this specific transaction yet. In bitcoin-qt, this is accomplished by going to help -&gt; debug -&gt; console -&gt; type in 'sendrawtransaction &lt;tx in hex form from link above&gt;'
    sendrawtransaction 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
You don't need to import your wallet anywhere to do this, by the way, and you don't have private key for 1GiCm9NRB1La1cPUjD8rnZUeko62A74Hrv anyway. Also, apparently the "free transaction relay policy" is out of date, you need to get your node to connect to 192.3.11.20 and wizkid057.com instead of 173.242.112.53, so
    addnode=wizkid057.com
    addnode=192.3.11.20
I would help you myself but I don't have free space on my work computer to download the blockchain.
* Install bitcoin-qt
* Get it connected to wizkid057.com (Eligius.st mining pool) by creating bitcoin.conf in c:\users\yourusername\appdata\bitcoin\ and putting 'addnode=wizkid057.com' and 'addnode=192.3.11.20' in there
* broadcast raw transaction
Oh and obviously your node has to be fully synced to the network.
Edit: Okay I just got home and tried rebroadcasting your tx. It worked, apparently my node "forgot" about it, so i was able to resend. Hope shit works out for you man.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:34:31
You could use a vpn/tor if you are looking for anonymity.

As everyone has already told, it's irrelevant. Yes, having presumed control of 1/20th (I strongly believe those coins are lost) is somewhat concerning - but so what? Does the inventor of the currency of the future not deserve a reward?

Mining difficulty depends on the price, not the other way around. Right now, mining difficulty is climbing  because miner are transitioning to a new technology - ASICs. You can see a similar climb around the time of the transition from CPU to GPU.


We call them "weak hands". People who have been in the game for a while or just people with a general knowledge of how a market works are the "strong hands". The weak hands lose money to the strong hands, that's the way markets work and will always work. You need to have a clear mind and balls of steel to win.

We don't actually **need** more people mining or more computational power for mining - all that accomplishes is a lesser slice of the pie for an individual miner. However, as bitcoins get popular, people will want to make free money mining bitcoins, which means the ROI of mining will eventually hover around 0 after factoring in power costs.

I disagree. What's going to happen is that the part of the network that was cut off is probably not going to produce the 2016 blocks needed for a difficulty adjustment and will simply stall.


Nope not going to happen either because even if both forks are being mined on, as soon as the network is reunited, everyone will use the longest fork.
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:20:07
It's "unstable" because it loads the entire blockchain into memory. All 6 gb of it.
You don't **have** the blockchain on an offline wallet computer. Therefore it's not an issue, as long as the computer you actually use for sending out the signed transaction has &gt; 6 gb. I have 16 on my desktop, so I'm in the clear.

Bitcoin does not work with balances. Bitcoin works with transactions.
Each transaction has an input and an output. So in this case, PublicKey1 (P1) has an unspent transaction output of 5 BTC (T1) and P2 has an unspent transaction output of 7 BTC (T2).
All you need to do is create a transaction that has T1 and T2 as inputs, and P3 as the output.
Wallet software handles it automagically.

No, **nothing** has intrinsic value and everything has subjective value. Food is only valued by us because it is an energy source which we require to keep alive. When we are low on food, the relative value of food goes up. When we have too much food, the relative value of food goes down.
However, brushing that aside and accepting your definition of "intrinsic value" as "providing utility in and of itself", Bitcoin is not just a money system, it's also a system that can be used for unbreakable message encryption, unforgeable digital signatures and notary services. It can also permanently [prove that you had some file at a particular point in time](

An excerpt from Atlas Shrugged (retold/reformulated a bit) with John Galt replaced by Satoshi Nakamoto and Gerald Starnes replaced by Barack Obama.


know . . . The meeting was held on a spring night, twelve years ago. The six thousand of us were crowded on bleachers built way up to the rafters of the plant's largest hangar. We had just voted for the new plan and we were in an edgy sort of mood, making too much noise, cheering the people's victory, threatening some kind of unknown enemies and spoiling for a fight, like bullies with an uneasy conscience. There were white arclights beating down on us and we felt kind of touchy and raw, and we were an ugly, dangerous mob in that moment. Gerald Starnes, who was chairman, kept hammering his gavel for order, and we quieted down some, but not much, and you could see the whole place moving restlessly from side to side, like water in a pan that's being rocked. 'This is a crucial moment in the history of mankind!' Gerald Starnes yelled through the noise. 'Remember that none of us may now leave this place, for each of us belongs to all the others by the moral law which we all accept!' 'I don't," said one man and stood up. He was one of the young engineers. Nobody knew much about him. He'd always kept mostly by himself. When he stood up, we suddenly turned dead-still. It was the way he held his head. He was tall and slim—and I remember thinking that any two of us could have broken his neck without trouble—but what we all felt was fear. He stood like a man who knew that he was right. 'I will put an end to this, once and for all,' he said. His voice was clear and without any feeling. That was all he said and started to walk out. He walked down the length of the place, in the white light, not hurrying and not noticing any of us. Nobody moved to stop him. Gerald Starnes cried suddenly after him, 'How?' He turned and answered, 'I will stop the motor of the world. Then he walked out. We never saw him again.

The catch is that 51% of the total hashing power must accept it. And pool operators are known for running old versions - some still run bitcoind 0.3.
You also misunderstand - exchanges are built on top of the network, not the other way around. They are not involved in verifying the network transactions. Furthermore, exchanges already follow anti money-laundering laws - that's what AML/KYC regulations are for.

Edit: So basically, install a wallet on a phone or tablet, and use that to accept Bitcoin in a brick-and-mortar type store. Not that difficult, all you need is internet connectivity.
For instance, the [Bitcoin Wallet]( app for Android allows you to request payment and type the amount in dollars at the current exchange rate! Then it displays a QR code which the customer scans with his phone and sends payment to. Provided that both phones are connected to the internet, the payment should arrive within seconds.

No such thing as wallet address. A wallet is a collection of bitcoin addresses, anywhere from one to however many you like.
If you still see the BTC on Virwox, you didn't withdraw anything yet. So go ahead and download a Bitcoin client (electrum works nice, they say), create a wallet and withdraw everything in there.
Make sure you encrypt and backup your wallet. Encrypting should be available in the Bitcoin client settings. Backup to DropBox, email, usb stick, etc.
There's a [neat mobile Bitcoin client]( by the way. Make sure you have a backup in case you lose your phone. And make sure your phone has a password or at least pattern lockscreen on it.

It's not bad, it's that people want to cash out some of their earning to pay credit cards or things of that nature. It's just what happens.
If you have 4 BTC in ASICMINER and BTC shoots up to $200, your share will be worth less because of people selling and you have, say, $600 in liquid(able) funds.

@_date: 2013-09-06 01:58:50
Sure. Your bitcoin public address is not actually your public key, it's a hash of your public key. When you send a transaction, your public key is exposed via ECDSA. If you never reuse your addresses (i.e. you hold on balance on an address you previously sent a transaction from, you may be vulnerable). So the easy solution is to not reuse your addresses, freeing you of any theoretical possibility of cracking your private key.

Depending on how you want it, you have several options.
You could simply get a tablet, a smartphone or a computer and use that to accept BTC straight as is, without a third party service. This is probably the easiest route, especially if you intend to keep that money in Bitcoin.
Another option would be CoinKite - a Point of Sale system specifically for Bitcoin. 
You could also use a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase.
Coinbase is actually a wallet / PoS interface, so that could also work, although I guess this isn't much different from having a wallet on your tablet/phone.
Just make sure to have a good, sane, backup plan in case the device breaks, and encryption in case it's stolen.

You could have resubmitted the transaction to the network using the following:
*Open bitcoin-qt

BFL is currently 9 months behind on preorders.
There is no competition yet - this is why ASICMINER is getting away with selling hardware above ROI. Which is nice for me as a shareholder.
Competition is coming soon though - KnC miner, Terrahash, etc. You should be able to order a device and have it at your doorstep in 3 days about 3-4 months from today.

That just isn't going to be possible for Bitcoin because the whole world is just starting to learn about it - unlike the dotcom bubble. This is an extremely low level and the price cannot stay low for long with the recent exposure.

I was pointing out that sending "cash" via the internet is not an option - you would be using third party services such as PayPal.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is commodity money and a payment system at the same time you cannot have one without the other. In addition, you are transferring value, not IOUs (debt). It's fundamentally different.

A wall is a large buy or sell order that smaller fish will bump into. It keeps the price from rising in case of sell order and it keeps the price from falling in case of buy order. Nothing to do with technical analysis.

I am saying that your model provides no anonymity and it's not the one used by non-corporate VPNs aimed at anonymity.
You do in fact have an encrypted tunnel between you and the VPN provider, and there isn't any need for tags because the VPN provider knows which connection that it opened to a third party server corresponds to which client.


For the nth time, because it opens the connection and packets have sequence numbers.

I do not know the exact mechanism, but a naive approach would be a to keep a database of which connection that you opened corresponds to which of your clients.
I can't give you the "actual technical details" because I am not a VPN provider.
Each packet the VPN provider receives from a third party server is associated with a specific connection that the VPN provider initiated. It has a tag **per connection** not **per client**. This seems to be the crux of the disconnect we're having here.
NSA wouldn't know which client has initiated a specific connection, in this case to bitmessage.

The answer is that more and more people will buy mining hardware until the profit margin is very thin and it is no longer worth it to mine bitcoin because you'd be losing money on electricity.
The same with any other industry.
For bitcoin, as energy prices go up, some miners will give up and stop mining, but the inflation doesn't change due to difficulty adjustments.

Yeah that's false unless you ONLY build on top of your own chain, ignoring the other 49% who include transactions in blocks.
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:13:27
Eligius actually has NO fees since about a month ago. And they give transaction fees to the miners instead of keeping them, unlikely all other pools.
Highly recommended.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:13:37
Someone probably sent a bunch of no-fee transactions, which take a looong time to confirm.

Mining will expand until it overshoots and than jumps back down right to the break-even point. In this case that point is $112/BTC. If BTC goes up, mining becomes more profitable and more miners join in, until they reach that threshold again.
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:12:45
The whole point of the setup is that even if your daily computer is compromised, nobody can get to you private key anyway.
However, if your online computer crashes or is stolen, you can simply create a new watch-only wallet on your offline computer and copy that to any computer you like.

First two points: Not **yet**. That's my earlier note. It is dumb to compare it to mature currencies at the current stage.
Second two points:  
1) Hoarding is not inherently bad  
2) I don't see any reason to have a way to get it back once it left your account. That's the point - it's just like a physical item (say, gold), except it's infinitely divisible and digital.


It's quite the opposite - it is public, digital, and decentralized, controlled by nothing but uncorruptable algorithms which has never happened before in the history of humanity. I also think it's a little early to speak of "failed".

Your scenario is impossible. First of all, their quantum computers are very specialized and can't do double sha256. Second, even if they magically could solve 1 block every second at current difficulty, the difficulty will adjust in 2016 blocks (33.6 minutes if 1 block/sec) and the next 2016 blocks will be solved in 2 weeks, because that's how difficulty adjustment works.

They are probably lost on purpose. I am sure the guys behind Satoshi saved a few thousand coins for themselves, but it really seems like the first coins were cast into the void.

You mean 35% extra. Otherwise that would be great.
@_date: 2013-07-02 19:00:03
I, for one, won't participate, and most people with miners will probably be on my side, so it's unlikely to happen.
Mining is like voting, except you have to have beefy hardware to vote. CPU miners will be drowned out just like they were in 2010 when first GPU mining applications came out.


What you are suggesting is PPCoin. Look into that. Meanwhile I'll keep mining Bitcoin, which was created, in part, explicitly to disallow any form of involuntary taxation.

My BTC or my Gov-BTC? I'd sell off my Gov-BTC as fast as possible, and since BTC is also probably dropping at the time, I'll sell that too and buy some other cryptocurrency until BTC stabilizes back (which may just mean that we're dropping BTC and moving to, say, LTC). I'd buy back once BTC has bounced off the inevitable floor, though.

Again, exchanges take no part in the network hashrate. If they send out invalid transactions - those will never be included in the real fork, and are therefore as good as nonexistent, which effectively shuts down the exchanges. Nothing more.


Now **that** is an actual threat.

@_date: 2013-11-07 21:27:34
No, Bitcoin operates on transactions, not balances.
You need to resend the same transaction. If you were using Bitcoin-QT, you could open up the debug console, use the command "getrawtransaction" to get the already-signed transaction in raw form, and then use another node to broadcast the transaction to the network.
But you can't do that with blockchain.info, so all you can do is wait, basically.

Right, edited. Sorry.
You are correct - every node keeps a pool of unconfirmed transactions in memory and checks every new incoming transaction to make sure there isn't a double spend. If the transaction has been recorded in a block (and it's not orphaned later), it's set in stone.
I also believe some clients refuse to let you spend unconfirmed funds.
@_date: 2013-09-12 01:45:15

Yes, but nowhere does it say that you can't have billions of CPUs in your control, which is functionally what ASICs are.
For context 


decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains.
So, turns out we're really talking about CPU power here, not number of CPUs.

@_date: 2013-09-22 20:00:29


Eh? Why would you cycle clients?
It's simple. You can even use standard Bitcoin-QT.
When you need to accept money from anyone, create a new address for that. Whenever you spend money, your client sends it to a new address.
One problem with this: the way to track you is if you pay someone and it comes out that you need to combine two different transaction inputs for the payment, one somehow tied to your legal identity (say you paid amazon and they subpoena amazon for your address), and one tied to whatever else it is you ordered (on Silk Road, for instance).
Bottom line: to stay completely anonymous, create a second anonymous wallet which you will not use when you are trying to conceal your identity. Send some money to it via a mixing service that keeps no logs.
And voila.
PS: Armory (the client) has the ability to manage multiple wallets.

Hmm, a paper backup is foolproof. But actually, nevermind backups.
There's been a warning issued for Armory that this version sometimes runs out of RAM (because it loads the entire blockchain, 6GB, into RAM).

Leave it running. The reason it's slowing down towards the end is because the blocks are larger in size due to Bitcoin being used for more transactions (remember blocks are records of ALL transactions).

You can use other clients such as Armory.
Using a new address for each transaction is key for protecting against potential ECDSA attacks - can't break it if your full public key was never broadcast in the first place (which happens when you make a transaction).

VPN is not a simple proxy. The connection from VPN to me and back is encrypted, and the VPN itself doesn't identify my real IP, the "to" address is the VPN's address. It knows which connections it's opening for which real IP, which is how it knows where to forward the encrypted packets.
Imagine Client A (me), Guy B (VPN), Dude C (remote server I want to talk to):
    A: *Hey B, ask C xxx and yyy!*  
    B: *Ok A*
    B: Hey C, xxx and yyy?
    C: Hey B, xxx and yyy are totally zzz!
    B: *Hey A, C says xxx and yyy are totally zzz!*
    A: *Thanks, close connection*

\* means it's encrypted

Poisson distribution is applicable to Bitcoin mining (blocks are found according to a Poisson distribution with an average of 10 minutes), but how the hell do you apply it to price?

A payment network and mechanism is being secured from any and all attackers. That's the benefit, and it's quite important. 
In order to perform a 51% attack, one must produce &gt;230 TH/s which is not feasible even for a government.

Friedcat mentioned that they won't release the profits from the miners until they actually ship some, which they have (200 units afaik). However, they haven't shipped the bulk yet, so we may see the profits reflected on the next week dividends, not this week.

Getting the block is the issue, isn't it?
In order to "find" a block, you have to throw virtual dice until you hit a number that has *n* zeroes in front of it - a number smaller than some value defined by bitcoin difficulty.
For instance, the hash of the freshest block at the moment is 0000000000000053898edbdd773f72f94d47647ac91dd124d4809249ec9495bf. Notice the zeroes in front, and compare to the first block ever: 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f. Notice that the number of zeroes required now is quite a bit higher.
It's a gigantic chance game where miners compete to see who will be the first one to find a winning value, taking the most recent previous block into account.
