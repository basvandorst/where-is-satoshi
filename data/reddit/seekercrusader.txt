Although we had just gotten back up to the higher 9k's so we could just be oscillating from lower 9k to higher 9k, atleast that has been the case since we dropped from the pentadigit world.

Well we just entered free fall since 20 minutes ago, so I guess it depends on whether you plan to day trade or just look at the price at the end of the day.

Just saw someone sell 28 and another buy 16
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:50:49
Wow, it's just climbing on through, look at that folks, we've got ourselves 12.5k!
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:05:24
Just the equivalent of a *chest X*\-*ray...*
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:12:20
Ohhhhhh look at that, it hit 12k and now it's dippin once again
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:23:23
gotta fight through 13k first
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:37:10
Big moves going on today!
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:00:39
Let's break 10k once again!
Also, I am so happy I didn't sell yesterday when things got rough, HODL bois and girls!
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:15:27
Personally, I don't think so
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:31:34
I think, at worst, you can do a bank wire...

Now to clarify, I don't believe pump and dumps are controlled by a few whales or something, I think it's just the mentality of certain traders who see a huge positive curve and will sell at the first negative curve.
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:59:59
I'll give you the first two.
Trade war with China has been ongoing so it may help with the general upward curves but not huge increases like this. Halving ain't comin for a bit, I don't think the general populous really cares yet or hasn't really been told. Altcoins are always dying (or should anyhow).

I mean yeah, you have a chance to gain money, but you always have to gauge if it's really worth it. The hardest "timing of the market" is to know when the market is at it's relative maximum, sell, and then buy back. That also mean's you're staring at a 1min graph for the next 12 hours as you have nervous breakdown. So you know...

I'm easily at -300, tbh, why not hodl? If you don't really need the money then why not wait until one day it goes back up? The money I put in isn't really needed until two years later and I'm certain by then, atleast by one occasion, prices will go back up. So if you don't really need to money right now, might as well wait. Like all markets, up's and down's exist and might as well not waste those 240$ you've "lost".

So, who here thinks its a pump and dump scheme?

Well damn, that's one hell of a monthly income

I'm a bit new to all of this but I have been reading up on everything that has been said for the past week. With that being said, I keep seeing stuff about DCA. I was wondering on how to set that up to do it automatically with perhaps coinbase pro or someone else.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:07:32
I just witnessed someone sell 10 BTC, smh...
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:20:45
Thank you!
