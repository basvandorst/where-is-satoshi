Not trying to be a dick, but is there any documentation that can help validate that statement?  I ask because I really want to believe you and I really want the guy above you to be wrong.  But I also don't want to just nod and say, "Yeah, that's what I wanted to believe, so that's what I will believe!"

Celebrimbor accepts bitcoin?

Well, I think the drama alone has dissuaded new from buying into bitcoin.
Mike did raise an excellent point, albeit unintentionally.  There is no regulation behind bitcoin.  There is nothing stopping anyone from accruing the necessary influence and capital needed to damage everyone else for their own benefit.
Banks today try to do this but if they get caught, they are fined, jailed, etc.  There is no reason for me to trust those in control to not exploit me for money when their entire goal to begin is the accrual of money.
Peace out, unsubscribed.

I'll never give them a single cent short unless I'm approaching the choice of starving or converting.

Y'know, ever since Saturn went down, I get a lot of their old customers that are pissed that they can't buy a new Saturn.  :(  Still, Subaru does them well.

Getting arrested for a false alarm might actually be the best thing to ever happen to Ahmed.

1.  Yes, but only in passing
2.  After reviewing your website, I can say that I like the simplicity of your layout.  As a guy that sells cars, I know the objections of making an investment.  The customer is frightened by the unknown, they don't want to make a commitment that they feel could damage them.  This website you've linked takes a bit of that tension out of the equation. That said, see 
3.  I'm not sure if this is so much your fault as it is a problem with the industry, but feel like you would benefit greatly with a tutorial on the front page for those that are not 'logged-in' so to speak.  Yes, I'm aware of the one that is just a quick scroll down, but your existing customers aren't going to stress seeing the tutorial at the top as much as your potential customers will wonder what to do next because, simply put, they will not buy right away... But they will/may check a tutorial that is right in their face offering to help dispel the mystery surrounding your service and Bitcoin altogether.  In short, the more time they invest on your site, the more likely they are to make a purchase, especially if Bitcoin has been on their minds for quite some time!
