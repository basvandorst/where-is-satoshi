@_date: 2014-07-28 16:42:26
Are there options on transferring money to Australia as easily as domestic transfers? In that case you can access coinjar or OTC and those work well.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:15:28
There was an article on crowdsourcing assassinations that I read recently on this in the newspaper (ha!). Basically you (among others) bet a ridiculous number of BTC that someone is no longer alive by this date.

Nice! I've been paying my piano teacher with bitcoin for the past couple of months. We have remote lessons over Google hangouts and it works decently, except for the latency issue which means we can never play at same time or I can't be counted in by him for example. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:08:34
Yep. Tempted to buy some gold when I saw the vending machine at Jumeira Palms. Then I remembered how poor I was and that I had no business being in Dubai.

Have you looked at XCP/counterparty and its existing capabilities of issuing shares on the bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:38:10
Maybe ask around  on Freenode. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:09:56
Typically using a [Hawala]( system. Bitcoin can enable a Hawala system between two brokers that don't know each other (intermediate exchange), but with fiat it works pretty much instantly anyway, the brokers just need to know and trust each other.

Hey Sukrim, I'm the author. Can you please link me to existing projects that use Neo4j? The one that was most prominent was [this]( one, but that project has been abandoned for years. You can see in the issues where I and another fellow are having discussions on the usability of the repo (almost unusable).
I had a read up your link to BIP0030, but I'm not quite sure how a BIP on duplicate transactions has anything to do with my post? There's a chance of duplicate transactions on the blockchain (not sure if that BIP was implemented, checking the entire blockchain for a duplicate TXID is a waste of work in my opinion). Even if there WERE duplicate transactions, that would interesting to look at anyway as you'll see the block relations to each.
I've got a few issues with Neo4j. First is that it's running on the JVM and I'd like to avoid that if possible. There are also enterprise level licencing costs that I'd rather avoid also.
I do agree that 'node metadata' structure of Neo4j is easier to wrap your head around, but Cayley is similarly capable but needs a different way of thinking, basically by key value pairs under a unique hash by treating edges as keys and objects as values. Some great thoughts by Barakmich [here](
Plus Cayley has the choice of multiple blazing fast backends, one of which are great for high reads (bolt), suitable for my use case.
Thanks for reading the blog post!

When you fund your account in mtgox, it doesn't convert to BTC right? It keeps it in your mtgox account in the original currency.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:05:12
Yep, which doesn't mean much advantage for the consumer.

@_date: 2013-06-03 21:44:37
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:32:00
Yep, good to know. I can see this being a problem if people don't realise this once bitcoin goes big enough that people have more than 100 transactions.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:59:06
Yep, confirmed! Wow so much digital dough!
@_date: 2013-06-04 22:48:26
In fact, BTCT also forces a manual withdrawal by the admins which can take 24 hours if the withdraw amount is over 5 BTC! Pretty cool and I can see it helping. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 14:03:48
Yep and MTN Mobile Money is available in Ghana. The only thing you could probably do is setup a Bitcoin exchange there but even then it will be difficult.

Yes, come to the Australian bitcoin IRC channel and ask one of us. Or maybe I can trade with you. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:46:26
I'm confused, the article seems to indicate that they paid much higher than the current value of the shares to buy them back. How did you lose instead of gain?
@_date: 2013-07-16 13:33:53
Same, but with inputs.io as well!

I read somewhere once that if a website only accepts passwords of a certain length, disallowing specific characters or spacebars, then it means that their passwords are not stored securely? Is this true? 
I guess it makes sense, a hash/salt (sorry, crypto noob) should be able to encrypt any possible password type with any characters right?

I never really got the appeal to be honest. Is there something OSM provides that Google Maps does not?

Good point! I never thought of that.
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:28:26
Yeah I remember that but I think its just a backend for a normal exchange, making it easy for anyone to start their own exchange.
Open Transactions and Bitmessage is the most promising P2P exchange so far I reckon.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:15:51
My issue was sending a transaction in compact GUI mode didn't add a fee and a fee was only added in standard GUI mode. I hope they fixed it in this new version.

What makes bitcoin the 1%?
@_date: 2013-05-24 11:30:19
I'm surprised you actually with through Bit Innovate. They charge poor rates as well as 8 percent commission. Why didn't you just go directly through Mt Gox? They have a bank account in Australia. Takes 5 percent though but it all adds up in the end, plus the the actual conversion rates would be better. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 09:13:16
Electrum also has the option to not use change addresses. I imagine this would mean change gets sent back to the paper wallet anyway!
...Maybe. You can never know with bitcoin change addressing.

Are there any that accept Australian bank deposits? Mtgox is the only one I've found so far that does so.
@_date: 2013-06-17 12:36:38
Bitcoin aren't 200 mate. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 11:18:42
I guess the point is at $5000 its difficult to get enough users of the ATM to even break even on the device's cost.
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:36:00
There should be some sort of open source solution for this so people can make their own as a hobby or a good way for a small scale automated exchange. For instance I think one could have a nice home in the Computer Science club at university. The existence of this ATM could be put online so people travelling here can come visit and convert. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:21:52
But the thing is its because of a home loan. Loaning Bitcoins is a funky idea because it doesn't come from anywhere. 
I wonder how you would finance an entire home with just Bitcoin in the far future when there is no fiat currency. How would you do it? It would take 30 years to scrape together enough Bitcoins to get a house. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:26:17

@_date: 2013-03-31 21:44:39
Is there one private key per address? Does this mean after 100 transactions, you have 100 private keys? What is the best way to store this on a paper wallet?

Is there potential for freelance work for someone who only does it as a hobby? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:20:20
Excellent explanation. There appears to be no way to prevent this from happening, short of never spending the money on the paper wallet, and only depositing into it.
I suppose you could make a new paper wallet every single time you spend from it, but that would ruin the point, no?
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:38:22
The thing is that the public address can be a very fearsome looking thing! QR codes would be a good way to go perhaps?
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:16:34
They should just add the option to export and backup keys to Google Drive.
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:05:58
Yeah works now. I was freaking out for a second. Especially since some money is already stuck in Bitcoin-24, I didn't want it to happen again.
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:47:38


Needs to work on that math.
@_date: 2013-07-20 22:26:32
You could have multiple rings with some sort of Sharmir Secret Sharing implementation. Only when the tags are combined may you have the final private key!

Ah that makes sense. Hopefully the exchange rate between WMX and the others within Webmoney is decent.
To be honest, this is is the very first time I've heard of Webmoney. Sounds like its big in Russia. As an Australian, is it worth using? Is it even popular in the Western world?
@_date: 2013-05-14 08:38:50
Its actually not too hard for amateurs to make good renders nowadays. My favourite for ease of use is [Maxwell Render](
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:59:00
The issuer won't determine the exchange rate, the market will. So the issuer will state how many Bitcoins she has, and the OT servers will state how many dUSD she can get for those Bitcoins at that moment in time. The issuer doesn't get to decide the exchange rate.
Well the owner of the dUSD has two options:
1. Trade the dUSD on the market with BTC owners at the going rate. 
2. Redeem the dUSD with the original BTC deposit. The amount returned will be proportional to the number of dUSD owned independent of the current exchange rate.
This gives two options, and the owner of the dUSD can choose what benefits him most.
Thanks for reading by the way, I know what I wrote was damn long!
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:18:41
I still feel what I had to say is relevant.
I was about to put my precious Bitcoins into MtGox and did what people have been saying for weeks. I put them elsewhere, into Bitcoin-24, which went under a few days later.
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:38:59
How long does it take the transaction to be confirmed enough times to be satisfactory? It would take far too long in a quick supermarket atmosphere to pay in Bitcoins and have to wait for enough confirmations.
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:02:58
Cool! Love that catchphrase. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 15:36:38
That's actually pretty cool! I'd like a kids version of the Bitcoin Wiki which explains it in much simpler terms and more friendly graphics and explanations. Right now it seems to be some sort of aggregate news portal.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:28:59
Were there many issues converting the large amount of BTC to fiat? 
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:34:03
But how are you getting the BTC in the first place?
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:30:01
What is the solution then? 
I want to store my savings on a paper wallet, but from what you're telling me I can't spend anything out of it because the money will go into a change address! I see the problem, but no answer. This basically means paper wallets are only single use.
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:03:34
What are you waiting for? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:47:25
Not to mention if the internet gets shut down, bitcoins probably won't be that useful. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:15:47
I like to think of my USB key as my main DB and the cloud as my backup. I like to think that the fact that I'm even using KeePass means that I'm among to more secured amongst the population.
Current setup:
* No password on the DB
* Private key file an MP3 file on my USB key (should make it harder to find)
* Copy DB manually to cloud
* Phone manually update DB (Google Drive syncing doesn't work as it should)
I like to carry my USB key around with me and if I ever lose it I can redownload the mp3 file and grab an older backup from the cloud.

There was a short documentary/video on youtube about Bitcoin usage in Argentina. Take a look, you'll be surprised where communities can suddenly sprout out.
Also maybe you can encourage your colleagues to work for Bitcoin as well, to keep a nice steady flow coming into the country, hence making it easier to use for trades =)

Sent two crash reports already. I regret paying for this! Galaxy Nexus is meant to be a development phone too! 
Well hope you guys can fix the issues soon. I would like to have an option of "panic buy"  or "panic sell", which uses my entire balance to buy or sell bitcoin in one market order. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 06:32:37
Can you give me a link? This is something I've been planning to do. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 11:11:14
Yeah mate I have a Linux server running which I SSH into with my phone. This is good for emergencies when I need to buy or sell quickly, but is otherwise pretty cumbersome! Waiting for that BTCfx app to get its act together so I can natively buy and sell.
Good thing about Goxtool is that its really easy to write and script strategies for automated trading, and as you can see here is also easy to run on many devices.
@_date: 2013-05-24 05:54:05
Nah mate, I'm just a random internet guy. Its comforting to know that someone else has thought of it though and hopefully he is implementing it somehow!
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:09:31
There's definitely a market for it and you're right, the existing money changers are in a good position to do this.
...I doubt any of them will though.

Is there a way I can order two identical cards? That way I won't freak out if my life savings are in one card (aiming to use these as cold storage) and there's no backup (electronic or paper) anywhere else.
Alternatively, can you confirm selling kits for blank cards? That way I can make said backups myself.
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:18:46
If the backup of the wallet.dat is very old, then it will lose some coins right? I remember reading something about it generating 100 addresses, and then a new batch after those are used up. If your wallet.dat is old enough to only contain the first batch of 100 addresses then its a good idea to make a new backup.
Of course I'm not sure about this, someone please confirm.
@_date: 2013-07-03 08:05:40

Has it ever gone down? 
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:56:41

Yeah its fine. I notice the app is racking up a lot of negative reviews for what is potential a groundbreaking and brilliant app. You would need some sort of excellent PR stunt to get out of this one.
By the way, I updated again and still the same issue. I would recommend perhaps acquiring more devices on your own (Galaxy Nexus/Nexus 4 for development as usual0 for testing instead of releasing it to the wild in such an unworkable state as a paid app, just for app rating purposes.

Heheh. I saw the ginormous boost in hashrate of ASICminer and noticed that the shares haven't gone up in value yet. This was at 1.25BTC each. For the following weeks I reinvested all my dividends into ASICminer fractional shares.
Because of the massive boost over the past few hours I decided not to risk it and took all my shares out at 2.5BTC each. I suspect shares fall in value after the dividends are paid out and rise in value approaching the dividend payments (which is now).
I put in 6.5BTC, and now have 13BTC.
I researched all the other stocks and they either performed poorly, had very erratic values, or didn't pay dividends. I think I just fluked it this time though, I'm no trader.

The issuer of the dUSD is automated by the OT server.
So if I had 1 BTC and I wanted 100dUSD, the only way I can get those coins is to talk to the OpenTransactions server. The OT server will automatically check the market rate, talk to the other servers constantly to promote decentralisation, create a temporary wallet to deposit our BTC into and then will automatically send the dUSD in the person's wallet.
So I guess its like having an automatic currency converter inside the servers who control the supply of dUSD automatically depending on how much BTC you feed it and the going market rate.
The person sending the BTC doesn't create the dUSD, the servers do.

Its hard to explain. It just feels... right. Have you played music before? Its like the difference between playing on a grand piano compared to a digital one. I can create music on a digital piano, sure but it all just clicks together on the real deal.
I guess the tactile feedback is what makes it work. The way the keys react to my fingers, and the momentum of my fingers tapping on each key pushes the keys down the perfect amount so that my fingers can fly around and bringing my thoughts to the screen.
I'm typing this on a chiclet keyboard on a laptop at the moment and its horrible. I make mistakes, miss keys, get cramped wrists, and type slower.
I've had a bunch of gaming keyboards in my lifetime and they are still rubber dome keyboards. Its not precise. It feels like pressing on mush now. Meanwhile mechanical keys have that satisfying click EVERY time (this depends on whether you choose cherry brown, red, black or blue keys by the way).
I hope that answers your question. I was a bit vague but its something you can't really understand until you experience it for yourself.

While I agree with everything you've said so far, I still think from a consumer's point of view credit cards offer more benefits than Bitcoin. With credit cards you have buyer protection but Bitcoins take that away. As a selfish consumer I would choose the option that benefits me most. 
How does using Bitcoins benefit me as a consumer? Other than the anonymity, which the majority of people forego when doing things online already without too many issues. Fraud and identity theft does happen, but until it happens to me, it is unlikely I will feel the urge to migrate to Bitcoin.

I guess the advantage is how everyone uses it and how damn conveninent it is. Its basically what Bitcoin should be (digital wallets, send money quickly and easily over long distances) except tied to the fiat system.
I suppose if you were to leverage Bitcoins advantages over M-PESA or its equivalents, you would focus on the following things:
* Global presence
That's it really. Africans (your average Joemolulu anyway) don't really care about inflation, deflation, security, anonymity or whatever. And they don't need to store wealth because they have so little of it anyway. They are also not really concerned about the government collapsing because its pretty much a free for all compared to most Western countries in the first place anyway. 
Bartering goods happens a lot, IOUs verbally liberally given (even at shops), all workers get paid in cash. I just don't see any advantages of Bitcoin. The fellow who replied to me above is correct on all points, but I just think the concerns that Bitcoin addresses are very centric to the Western world.

Sounds good but the exchange rate should be competitive. I remember the one in America the other day (LA?) was using 30 dollars per Bitcoin which isn't very fair.

Why a CD? You get only 1% more than if you just deposited and left it in there.

You need someone who wants all of the fiat in Turkey to convert to bitcoins. I for one don't see the advantage of doing so.

The chips are 0.083 btc per chip. You're thinking of the usb miner that was sold by friedcat for a hefty mark up of 2btc per device.

Great thanks for that! Sounds like a pretty competitive field. I'll probably look into it as a hobby or something. I'm no artist or designer though, I've always been more technical

Cool! In fact there has been a thread that has been exploding recently [over at BitcoinTalk]( It seems myself and two other people came up with the same concept as crypto-backed digital fiat at roughly the same time.

My problem with this is what if the value if bitcoin skyrocket again? There would be less incentive to convert to WMX if 1 mBTC is pegged to 1 WMX.

Plus by the time the coffee is finished there would have been time for one confirmation by then.
