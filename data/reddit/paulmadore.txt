No one owes them that. You go into business, you should expect that the overwhelming majority of people will not only not want to do business with you, but if you reach out to them too aggressively (or annoyingly, as in the case of their shills continually posting in this subreddit, both identified and unidentified), they will be hostile toward you.

I'm not going to argue with you on the first things, in fact I basically agree about these shitheads, but here is how I see it: someone has to be 100% all the time fucking with the government or the government is going to rip the rug out from under us and introduce taxes in some fucked off bill and we'll all be bankrupt the following year and the year after that and wishing we'd had a lobby of our own to at least warn us.

It's never a good idea to entrust your bitcoins to anyone. I believe Coinbase had a service outage just the other day. You might look into a lightweight wallet like the one at  if you're interested in keeping the coins more to yourself, although that relies on servers (in a much, much different way from Coinbase.) But the better recomendation is to get a full node wallet (such as Armory, which focuses on security) to protect your coin. And also to get more than 5 pounds worth while they're at these prices, as most analysts predict serious price growth in 2016 as a result of the block reward halving.

If you can't even politick your way out of a Reddit post, you will not get my vote of confidence. This was easy: say nothing, because nothing you say will mitigate the impact. Or, better yet, if you're really clever, get out ahead of it by putting this information front and center in your reformation plans, acknowledging along with it the actions of other disgraced former members and lauded individuals. Transparency is always a good policy. Sorry, one of my only friends and mentors has been a lobbyist for going on 5 decades and I've learned a lot over the years from him about damage control, and so far you're just terrible at it, dude. You need to tell us 1) why we need you instead of a new organization of our own making (trivially done, seriously) 2) what will be done to mitigate future drama 3) what the plans are in terms of the regulatory environment and 4) exactly how much of your own treasure you're willing to match for every BTC you're going to ask from the rest of us this time around. Or something like that -- really that's just what I'd do, and I would never put myself in a position like you have.

No, Coinbase is a company and they rely on this community continuing to believe that they are ever actually going to turn a profit, which is up in the air.

While I appreciate the sentiment, I have to say that it's not a great analogy since censorship resistance is not Bitcoin's only feature, so in theory it would still be valuable without it. With Tor, however, there's no reason to bother with it if its privacy features or ability to be used by those in repressed areas are non-existent since those are its core benefits. Those who view censorship resistance as the core benefit of Bitcoin may not agree with me, however.

Well, there comes a point where the losers don't want to lose, I agree. But in this case we're talking about a community organization. The Bitcoin Foundation is widely hated. People have funded and run campaigns for the purpose of making it disband itself. They recently ejected a dude for having the attitude that it's fucked beyond belief. I think a new Foundation is in order, if it's necessary, if this thing is not going to kill itself. 
Andreas Antounouplous (sp) has said that they should disband. He has a relatively good reputation. Perhaps he should spearhead the replacement.

It's wrong in the sense that the blockchain itself does not store data beyond the transactions of bitcoins. What some have done, like Factom, is imprint hashes and "proof of existence" into blocks, which are immutable, thereby having a reference (in a hash) to the files in question. But the files themselves may not exist anymore by the time someone goes to follow that reference.

All of them understood that part of what made British power so mighty was the disarmed populaces it lorded over. The primary purpose of the Constitution was to prevent their work from being undone, to give the democracy experiment time to flourish. People had the right to keep and bear arms to defend themselves from the wilds, from the newly established government -- which they understood was quite vulnerable to being infiltrated by hidden loyalists and corrupted asshats -- as well as from potential other hostile forces, such as some native tribes and other European powers who'd see it as even easier to take the continent now. If it were any less important than a defining characteristic than it'd not have been codified into the constitution but rather as a law or something. 
I'm tired of people pretending the 2nd amendment is somehow out of date. I'm tired of people asking me why I "need" to exercise my rights. That's the same attitude that attacks any other civil liberty. 
There are dozens and dozens of countries with gun control. If you like gun control so much, move to one of them.

I don't understand the question. Nothing in the constitution authorizes even the existence of a police force while one of its core tenets authorizes me to keep and bear arms. At the same time, I've made no statement to that effect. No matter how much I detest the police, I wouldn't recommend they go around defenseless, if they're going to exist. I would advocate a complete reboot of the penal codes they enforce, as they are the actual root of all the violence, since they unfairly administer justice to the very poor, which leads to the very poor not trusting them and becoming more hostile toward them, which creates a cycle of us vs them and them killing people they can get away with killing. I've seen more merciful street thugs than I have police officers. Anyway it's a complicated subject, but the bottom line is that the police would very much like us to be disarmed, but in this country it would take an act of god to ever disarm those fucks, no matter what gun control laws you shoved through.

Fixed supply is a very important aspect of why people choose Bitcoin to invest in instead of other assets out there. A fixed supply asset that is valuable to others is a good investment, and no, you can't expect to profit off an investment in two or three months, though good for you if you do.
If there ever were even discussions about raising the limit at the levels where it could be done, people would begin to feel betrayed. Before you know it, people are selling while it's still worth anything. If people want inflation, they will go with a fiat currency. 
There are probably some who are more religious about Bitcoin, and they would stick with it through even an inflationary change. I'm not amongst them, though, and I harbor no guilt in saying it: if you remove the 21 million coin cap, the project is dead, and I'd sell even at a 50% loss to get away from it.

I don't think OP is encouraging censorship, as sub-OP insinuates. I think he's asking a legitimate question. 
I would be saying the same thing if Reddit decided to kill for whatever reason, that it's not censorship. I'd then suggest we all go back to Bitcointalk or some other forum of our own design, built on our own resources, moderated by our own terms of service.

So we all believe in healthy competition  here, right? 
For those who believe that an organization representing the interests of Bitcoin to governments and others who could have harmful impacts, why not start a competing organization which is transparent and designed in such a way that EVERYTHING they've done wrong can't be repeated? 
If memberships are reasonably priced in this competing organization, because I do personally have a stake in the future of Bitcoin, I would be willing to support for a minimum of 3 years.

Censorship is what the Russians did, the Chinese and the Cubans still do, to the press. They prevent them from saying things they don't like.
What Reddit is doing is quite different, since the communities in question are free to found their own websites to hate on various things. 
Buttcoin is not devoted to anything positive, but merely to ridicule Bitcoin. For whatever reason, this gets them up in the morning. If they lost their ability to do it on Reddit, they would not be censored. I repeat: they would not be censored, because they would still be able to do this. 
In fact, they have the upper hand. Just the other day, the Washington Post ran an obvious hit piece on Bitcoin, seemingly out of the blue. 
So, you can call it censorship, but you're wrong. If Reddit were the only possible place on the Internet for a community like Buttcoin, that'd be censorship. But since the Internet is wide open, and they can post anywhere they like, it wouldn't be. 
I applaud them in their dedication, but if Reddit brought the hammer down on them, I wouldn't see it as much different than bringing the hammer down on r/fatpeoplehate.

Sorry, bro, censorship is the practice of censoring.
In English, censoring was originally based on the morality police, who were authorized by, you guessed it, the government. (
The term gained far more usage with the rise of the Soviet Union. Again, government censorship.
This makes me want to get on Wikipedia and argue out the definition with the censors there. Oh wait, they're not censors, are they? They're actually just administrators of a privately held website, well within their rights to display whatever the hell they please. Until they go afoul of the actual censors, that is.
You're obviously stuck on this delusional path, so I'll leave you to it. But rest assured, the government killing someone for speaking out against it, which is a real thing that happens to this day around the world, that is censorship and repression. A private entity deciding not to represent the opinions of other entities, that is quite another thing which any thinking person would not seek to deprive said private entity from doing. 
So, what, every time I write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper and they decide not to print it, they're censoring me? I think not. They're deciding not to use their resources to promote my opinion, which is, again, not censorship.

The UK is a member state but they never adopted the Euro, for example.
Also, is it really complete destruction of the nation to reassess policies that cost more than they can afford, and to find ways to become solvent? All governments would do well to actually achieve this, but if you can't even service your loan, you have to trim the fat somewhere. As has elsewhere been noted, age 50 is a very low retirement age.

The current case against Garza has nothing to do with Paycoin, and when they do charge him related to that, it won't have to do with Garza "creating" anything because, unlike he has literally no technical skill and did none of the "coding," only told others what he wanted the scamcoin to do.

Free shipping? 5% back? 
Granted, they're not like they were when I first started using them in 2010. At that time, they actually had more competitive prices on most things I bought there.
But nowadays, when the price is roughly the same, I buy at Overstock, because I get the free shipping and 5% back.
The free shipping is key, too. I usually buy big stuff there. Bought a mattress there in April, actually, and it was better than the reviews said it would be. Shipping on that from most places would have killed me.

You are clearly delusional about the spirit of the word censorship. We're talking about reality here. 
In reality, Reddit has no power, nor desire, to suppress the opinions of or any of the others it is banning. It is exercising **its rights** to not represent, or display, the type of speech being exercised by those people. 
You are comparing suppressed political speech in communist countries to opinions expressed by bigoted, bored, and privileged people using private servers which have terms of service that said people are clearly in violation of by not actively doing anything besides trolling and being hateful. It is a huge stretch to imagine that Reddit has anywhere near the authority of the Chinese or Cuban government here, thereby making your argument absolutely irrelevant.

The thing I'm tripping on is that these cats are seriously going to ban cigarettes. They'll never get through with that. I never saw a smokier people in my life than when I was in the middle east. And as a lifelong smoker (have switched to ecigarettes), I loved it. I loved the freedom, and I loved the price, and I loved the lack of judgemental looks. There should be some health provisions for children and so forth, but I think in the west it has gone so far as to begin to restrict the rights of smokers in places like New York City and elsewhere, and the taxes have never been used in ways which actually solved the supposed endemic. Some of us are just always going to make unhealthy choices, I think. I wouldn't have switched to the eCigarette if my life hadn't changed; I'm not interested in giving my son the childhood I had, plain and simple. But if he grows up and he makes a bad decision with his health and smokes his lungs away the way I did, that'll be his right. All I can do is inform him. Why am I rambling? Oh yeah, because I think these guys are being silly at best by wanting to ban cigarettes in their new Caliphate. It's a signal to me that maybe they are some kind of foreign prop; this would be exactly the kind of thing the Special Forces are for (namely, destabilizing governments and/or installing new ones and/or making sure America has a financial and political stake in all positive developments anywhere but remains blameless in all things negative). Which has become a harder mission for them in recent years, but they're still at it. So this just really makes me wonder:

Miner’s “luck smoothing” excuse does not hold up to scrutiny
Posted on 2014-06-15
The enormous computing power of the GHash.IO pool sparked another debate about 51%-attacks. Pools with such a large share of the total hash rate threaten Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and make Bitcoin depend on the benevolence of the dominating pool – in this case GHash.IO. Obviously, it is not in the self-interest of miners to all mine in the same pool, as it undermines Bitcoins value. When asked, why they do so anyway, one frequent answer is “luck smoothing”. In this post, I want to dispel this argument.
Shares of Mining Power according to blockchain.info
The following table was obtained through a Monte-Carlo simulation and shows the variance of mining returns as a function of pool size. For example, when mining in a pool that controls 50% of the computing power, you can expect a daily variance in returns of 0.6% and a monthly variance of 0.03%. Thus, you will get very smooth returns as good luck and bad luck are in balance.
Should you decide to mine in a pool that only controls 3% of the total hash rate, you will see daily fluctuations as high as 20%. In other words: when you earn 1 Bitcoin per day at average, you will often see returns below 0.8 Bitcoins or above 1.2 Bitcoin – but it can also get as low as 0 if the pool is very unlucky that day. However, when looking at the variance at a monthly level, daily fluctuations tend to cancel each other, leading to a monthly variance of 0.68%.
Price Variance vs. Mining Return Variance 
 	Bitstamp Price	50% Pool	25% Pool	12.5% Pool	6.25% Pool	3% Pool	0.8% Pool	0.1% Pool
Daily	2.2%	0.6%	2.4%	4.8%	9%	20%	80%	900%
Monthly	49%	0.03%	0.08%	0.16%	0.25%	0.68%	3%	23%
Let’s compare this to the variance of Bitcoin prices. Unlike the variance of mining returns which gets smaller when looking at longer periods, the variance of the exchange rate goes up. The reason for this is that mining returns do not depend on the returns of the previous day (i.e. they follow an AR(0) process), whereas today’s price builds on yesterday’s price such that changes add up over time. Thus, when looking at daily returns, mining in a 25% pool adds fluctuations of 2.4% and price changes account for another 2.2% – givnig you 4.6% in total. However, the time horizon of a miner is not (and should not be) a mere day. Electricity bills come in monthly and obtaining new hardware is a process that spans over many months. Therefore, a more realistic timeframe to look at is one month. And here, the variance of the exchange rate dwarfs the variance of mining returns. When mining in the largest pool, you will get a total variance of 49.03% in USD terms. When mining in a 3% pool, you will get a total variance of 49.68%. Wanting to optimizing such a small difference is complete nonsense.

I think a better idea would be to get a few casinos to back one of the better up-and-coming coins, thus placing a fiat-like value on it: it is accepted at these casinos. 
What we are doing is no different than what casinos where I am from do all the time. You have to stick a little sheet of paper into a machine to get your cash before you leave. Change the whole system to where you can spend those coins outside of the casino...
And then you're winning.

The odds of your phone getting stolen in America are about 1 in 106.
The odds of Blockchain.info losing your Bitcoin are proportionally higher than other web wallets. According to Johoe, the problem then was in the way they were generating new addresses. Who knows if that's what happened to you or not.
Thus, using your phone to store a significant amount of Bitcoin is not a good idea, and I hope you decide to not do that again.
Then again, this is assuming that $1000 in Bitcoin is significant to you. It's significant enough that you're writing about it here, and either way, no one likes losing money.
So I hope you decide to keep most of your BTC in some other safe way (maybe you already do) and only keep BTC on your phone when you actually need it. I don't know about you, but where I live it is incredibly rare that I would actually need Bitcoin on my phone at all. Of course I hope this changes, and the sooner the better, but the reality is that you can very easily live with just having the app, maybe loaded with tops .5 BTC, and still not be put out. You can always send more to that wallet if/when you need it.
Just saying.
As to what you can do? Hope it's a white hat that jacked you, and that you weren't the only one. Or hope that Blockchain will reimburse you, if it is somehow their mistake.

Are you implying that copyrights don't expire or require renewal in the same way that patents do?
-- 
Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, usually for a limited time, with the intention of enabling the creator (e.g. the photographer of a photograph or the author of a book) to receive compensation for their intellectual effort. 
A patent (/ˈpætənt/ or /ˈpeɪtənt/) is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.

Make inexpensive devices that don't necessarily aim to find blocks, but rather to keep the network secure. I believe 21 is the group that has announced a "mobile mining" chip. The less it costs, the better, because its purpose isn't to make money, just to keep the network working. Presumably the people using these devices would have a vested interest in securing the network, while getting their Bitcoin through some other means, like buying it or getting it through business transactions.

Well, so far I haven't exchanged. I believe they just offer you the rate. You either accept it or don't. When you have BTC on your account with them and it's not converted to fiat, they pay a small interest rate on them. I don't think there's a fee for converting to fiat, but let me check real quick what it looks like when doing so.
I added two new images to the album which show the load process. 
You have control over when you convert to fiat, and you are able to buy BTC back as well.

Liken it to the wireless adapter issue that has cropped up in the Linux world, re: Broadcom. Had the kernel team decided to somehow make it impossible for distros to support Broadcom adapters whilst still using the "Core" Linux kernel, you bet your ass there'd have been at least one fork, as for a time (or possibly even currently) Broadcom adapters were pretty normal to find in laptops, and most people saw it as rude to demand that someone wanting to switch to Linux purchase a piece of hardware that had "free" driver software. Whatever the justification, there's a practical element that too often gets ignored by zealots of whatever stripe.
I'll agree that the 2mb hard fork doesn't solve the crisis, and I'll point out that neither does leaving the blocksize unchanged and merely adding SegWit, and most certainly LN is a layer on top of Bitcoin. 
One thing that is often left out of discussions about LN is that, no matter what its beneficiaries would have us believe, LN nodes will have their own "network effect," and random actors wanting to run a LN node will not get the same traction. Therefore, no matter what they say, there is a serious economic incentive in this for them, since the simple-minded bootlickers who speak too much of "gratitude" and "core" will most definitely make them rich if their vision pans out.

Armstrong is not supporting it from a technical angle and I don't agree with you that he is "someone who knows Ruby on Rails." He is someone who knows his business and believes that "Classic" will benefit it more than a continuation in support of "Core." Incidentally, he's far from alone in this belief. Toxic elements stalking Reddit saying puerile things whilst accusing those who disagree with them of being "children" have done more for "Classic" than anyone else, by alienating the economic majority with "anti-democratic" diatribe after "'cuz we said so"-fueled logic. Let's be clear: there is absolutely nothing unique about the skillsets of the people behind Bitcoin, there is a lot unique about their experience, but this does not, in any sense, make them irreplaceable. By such logic, the Linux kernel would be fucked in 10 or 20 years when Linus retires from active work, or Bitcoin itself would be fucked if catastrophe struck a conference or something. No, we need to stop all this silliness about them being somehow integral. Credit where it's due is what open source licensing and Git itself is all about.

I agree with parts of your statement here, but you should be aware that it is not possible to make an "asic-resistant" algorithm. In the end, the primary thing is cost -- it's expensive to develop an X11 ASIC, for instance, because you need extra RAM. It's not impossible, by any stretch, though. I think changing the algo at this time is a good move, as it would shake out entrenched interests. There's plenty of GPU hardware out there, I think the hashrate would rebound within a few months to an acceptable level, if not overnight.

Ironic use of the term, in that more recent academic studies of the term classify it as ["an ideology that "pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and **dangerous ‘others’** who are together depicted as **depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity**, identity, and voice."](
Seems to me that either those who are vehemently against traditionally open source forking and regularly appeal to non-existent authority are the populist ones, or both sides are populist in their own way. Recently I've become increasingly impressed by both the shallowness of the philosophical ideals behind the former group's standing (but, but, but) and their penchant for unfounded conspiracy theories.

That is a ridiculous way to say it. If Dash's value reached the level of Bitcoin's, you're stupid to think no one would build an ASIC for it. Just because it's not profitable to do does not mean it's impossible. It's only "resistant" because no one wants to do it. I mean, people do have GPU rigs they've spent significant sums on mining X11, do they not?

I'm not buying that part of it at all. I interviewed Harry Ullman (from Bytecoin) in depth. He got confused at one point and referred to us as CoinTelegraph (we are CCN). I corrected him and he apologized. The whole aura of talking to him at the time implied that he knew nothing of the innards of how these sites work. This is inconsistent with Ian's story, because Ullman has been with Bytecoin from the very beginning and is also their media representative. This was not a mistake he'd have made if he and his friends were the founders of CT. 
I just find this whole aspect really hard to believe because, basically, I think that Bytecoin would be a lot more widely known/popular if they had a whole media front pushing their narrative or trying to get more people involved with Bytecoin.

Well, now that I'm reading through this, I find a serious flaw in Ian's theory: CoinTelegraph existed before Bytecoin. Only one of these theories can be true. The one that puts Bytecoin as being invented sometime last late summer/early fall has a lot more going for it in terms of evidence. 
It would seem that if the Bytecoin thing is true, it would still make sense for the owners of CT to have an interest, supposing they got in on some of the initial coin offerings for Bytecoin. 
It seems that if the CT thing is true, then Bytecoin existed for as long as they claim. 
These are exclusive theories, I believe.

Well, your whole idea of a "premine scam turned website" just doesn't wash for me. If I was at the early end of a $15M+ scam, I would just exit. Why carry on with it? You split up the winnings and move on. You don't launch this whole project with hopes of reviving your scam. I really just don't think Bytecoin is as central to all this as you've come to believe.
I think there's an alternative conspiracy theory that might make a lot more sense than Bytecoin devs. The website which fundamentally focuses all CryptoNote coins, MinerGate. They would stand to gain from more people mining Bytecoin, picking up on Bytecoin, believing in Bytecoin, even more than an early adopter who was holding say 20% of the coins. Because a marginal 1-20% gain (brought on by occasional newcomers buying in deeply) is nothing compared to earning real cash from the efforts and investments of others. Which is more profitable, Bitcoin evangelism or selling things for Bitcoin? Ultimately they can both enrich you, but selling things (like a slick mining service) is surely the more effective way. They have it set up with multiple currencies, something for everyone. So if I was to believe there was an editorial position on CryptoNote coins, I'd either 1) think that management was deep into it and therefore required it to be doing well in order to pay well or 2) think there was some other business that benefits by more people using Bytecoin. 
I wouldn't think that founders of Bytecoin were also the founders of CoinTelegraph, not without a sizable preponderance. I think that if said founders ever had a large supply of coins to parlay into some other operation, a cryptocurrency news site would be the last idea to even be considered. Also, if Bytecoin were just a scam, and it was that successful, it seems to me they'd have simply gone and repeated the same thing.

I just thought this through and the only secure way you could do this in person would be to have some kind of receipt printer with you. Have the person generate their own QR code and give you the public key to press onto the bill. It could be done but it wouldn't be as appealing as all the customization you can do when you're designing the whole note in one go. You'd be stuck with only one version of the QR code, really, and it'd pretty much have to be black and white -- which very little "real" money is. 
Would be really fun to have some kind of thing where you go around taking people's photos and then handing them little squares that have their photo underpinning a QR code. The QR code is a nominal amount of BTC you're paying them to use their photo on your new website, which would be called "Bitcoined" or something. The device is what I'm talking about that would be cool. I just can't see it being very feasible.
Just to let you in on what started my rambling, it's this whole idea of private key holding. It's the only reason paper wallets aren't the best way to do things IRL, and perhaps a big drawback to adoption. When we first get to Bitcoin we think of money in units. A $100 is 5 $20s, and in our mind there is no important difference between the two. With Bitcoin we see there is really only one large number that encompasses all of it, and only portions are divided amongst these various "wallets." This is really hard for someone to conceptualize because it's entirely different. If someone hands you a $10 bill, a single unit, you can assume that it is a $10, except if it's counterfeit. Even if a corner is missing, it's still worth $10 or can be exchanged for as much. With Bitcoin if someone was holding the private key at the same time as you, they could easily start siphoning off small amounts as time went on, and it'd be difficult for you to notice. You'd be forced to sweep the coins to another address. This is the fundamental barrier part. People have to want / know how to make that next step. 
So I'm having a lot of thoughts around this, and another might be that there needs to be a tertiary stage: the redemption. So the paper wallet should clearly be saying "worthless until redemption." Then the user creates their Bitcoin wallet and goes to the redemption place. Maybe it's a site they can use their iPad with or something. This then sweeps the funds to their real wallet, effectively having them now as owners of the Bitcoin. 
Simply having a culture where we can Indian-give the BTC at all times won't work. Either something like what I've described could be created, or some new addition to the software could be created, some new type of address that would be "transferrable." What I mean by that is, even if the creator of the private key knows it, it doesn't work once they've transferred it, it mutates into a new one, or something.

Can confirm this, paid significantly higher fees. Whatever 50,000 Satoshi was worth on most of them and whatever 100,000 was worth on two of them. I think the latter was about a quarter. I did it strictly because I knew what was going on and in hopes that it would help me. Two transactions wound up getting "stuck" but I eventually realized that if after a reasonable period they haven't shown up where they're meant to go, you can resubmit the same exact raw transaction (in Armory) and hope to have better results. It worked in my case. 
However, I think a big problem with this was that... well, how's a regular old user supposed to know it's time to pay a higher fee? I don't think everyone should have to be "Bitcoiners" to use bitcoins. They should be able to effectively use the system without what amounts to "inside knowledge."

I didn't use the word "altcoins" intentionally as it is increasingly less accurate as ecosystems mature. In fact I think it's an intellectually bankrupt word. The overwhelming majority of them didn't begin so that they could be an "alternative" to Bitcoin. Many of them began simply to scam, and those have their place at any carnival. But many more began to achieve a specific goal, whatever it may be, and whether or not Bitcoin exists is irrelavent to their communities or creators. This is to say, and let me be clear, these communities are not trying to be an alternative. Altcoin is a falsehood, meant to keep the narrative such that they can never be considered on equal footing. But if you view it from a wider scope, you see this plain as day: Dash doesn't have nearly the developmental disabilities we see over here. I can't even begin to know why, I only know what I see. I say that as someone who hasn't held Dash since it was called Darkcoin. 
Anyhoo, I meant to clarify that I also buy gold and silver, but I don't see either metals or cryptos as being an end-all, be-all. In my armageddon scenario things still have to get done in society. A competent person willing to work and apply their skills/trades will suffer less than those who rely too much on material hording. In fact, I think in the armageddon scenario I'm describing, it's more like those with only one skill or those with no skills (privileged elites) will suffer because they can no longer buy all the services they want as easily. Or the cost/value of those services skyrockets in a market no longer regulated by force. Either way, my point is that there are intangible things that hold eternal value as well. 
The only thing I take for granted is that the dollar will continue to lose value by design, so I am hawkeyed looking for ways to grow my dollars at a faster rate than inflation. Particularly interested in putting as much of them into property as possible.

It's like this. 
If someone else doesn't like something and they complain about it, they can go their own way. They can fork. They can get fucked. 
However, if a certain chosen few are not satisfied with what appears to be ubiquitous consent to scaling solutions, and are making decisions not based on technical solvency but financial incentive and belief, then they're getting robbed when everyone else decides not to abide that. 
I get your point. It's quite clear to me now. Unless I said something you object to, in which case I invite you to illuminate my simple mind.

Fair enough. I don't have the data to argue. 
I think in a way I personally take issue with a lot of it because people say things like "there's a minimum wage" in service industry. When I started out working that minimum wage was specifically different for some hospitality workers. It was around a third of what mine was. I never thought that was quite fair, even when I saw them doing well. They had a skill I didn't: salesmanship.
Cab drivers also have a skill I don't: patience. There's no way I could be a cab driver because the first drunk turd to puke in my cab and argue about the cleaning fee, I'd be in jail. 
So I mean, in the end, I think it's disgusting that people have a problem with workers earning money, extra money even. I can't see where they'd rather the money go. Plus, I haven't seen it said once that if you don't like the cab system, buy a fucking a car. I don't know how that didn't get mentioned in this thread, I guess it's because we have a convenient narrative: blame the guvnt. It's the guvnts fault in NYC that you can't afford a car and it's also their fault you can't afford a cab so fuck the people who played by the rules. I have a hard time differentiating such a philosophy from any other hypocrisy I notice, including my own. 
If someone has performed a service which you requested, no matter what, they are not begging. They are negotiating. And that is in the rare case where they are uncouth enough to actually say, "What, no tip?" In a free country of civilized men, is it that hard to say, "Oh, my mistake. I meant to tell you that you took a bad route, cost me too much, and that's why I can't tip you." (Which I've done.) Or, "Really bro? It took you an hour to come get me and you didn't even bother to say why. On a Wednesday afternoon!" (Which I've also done.) 
But I guess that requires one to not develop policies such as, "I don't tip b/c it encourages bad behavior" or "I don't tip b/c it perpetuates fucked-off societal arrangements." No, I prefer to live my life in a slightly more interesting way and take it as it comes. There are most definitely motherfuckers I won't tip out there in the world, but I can justify that to myself, because if I had been in their shoes I would have served me better.

A typical conversation between a business owner and a friend would illustrate our problems well. "You mean you **gave** him his paycheck and he said you owed him overtime?" "He only worked 45 hours."

Well, Bastiat was full of shit, now wasn't he? 
I've always been specific. Some oppose fair access to education because they think the poor should remain ignorant. Others think public education magically makes society better.
I've never heard a socialist say they think libertarians or whoever Bastiat identified with oppose all education. I've heard them specifically berate the idea of abolishing public education for various reasons.  
To me, early education is essential for all children, especially of the working class who do not have time to pass on things like math skills and language arts. 
I don't think it should ever be compulsory, though. 
The last bit comes through false as well. Socialists will say something like, "to each according to need." Socialists do support nationalizing things like farms and food processing plants, but most of them will settle for programs that enable those without to eat. 
At the same time, I've never seen radical capitalists outline any sort of viable alternative solution, only say that they do not want it the way it is. This is not just counterproductive, it ruins their chances of ever gaining wide support. The way to approach it is to start with something like, "I agree. It is wrong that a species as advanced as human beings allows some of its most contributing members (workers) to go without basic needs. However, this centralized forceful institution known as the government is not the most effective way to solve this problem. Here is my non-profit corporation's outline, how we intend to pay for the program without a single cent of taxpayer money, and how we expect it to work."
Etc. You don't see much of that because libertarianism has devolved from a high ideal to another niche activity of mostly privileged participants. You'll know that it's taking itself seriously again and making progress when they have answers to all the current solutions (which are failures, abject failures, as I'm sure you're dying to let me know.)

From a marketing perspective I agree with you. It's always a bad idea to force someone to learn something new as a prerequisite of understanding what you do / what you can do for them.

That much seems obvious, that you won't be tipping. It's not what I'm interested to know. What I'm interested to know is how such intelligent people as I see writing here can be missing the long-term effects of this on the markets we're talking about. Uber will eventually monopolize some markets. I wonder if there is anything in their charter to stop them from, at that point, acting like a proper monopoly.

To better aid my research, please leave some demographic info in reply to my comment. Actually I think this calls for a whole research study on consumer habits vs. service employees. 
The reason tipping is not compulsory is that it's a form of meritocracy. The best should get the most tips, and the worst should get none. By never tipping, you are punishing the best and abiding the worst.

Debate is normally applied to topics that will not be resolved. There are some who will never agree it is a woman's right to abort a fetus in her own body. That debate will never have a resolution.

Someone please illustrate what this would look like in practice. I'm trying to understand, from the consumer perspective. They click a "accepts Bitcoin" button and if they're not on the right chain, their transaction is not accepted? Saying out there in commerce world. Would it require Coinbase to make a choice, and by extension the clients of Coinbase (if they didn't like Coinbase's choice, they'd go elsewhere)?
Not trying to stir up anything, just want a non-contentious mental image of what this proposition means. 
Because in practice, I think could be right -- that would amount to consensus, in a way, since everyone would get what they want. It's a question of how much value would remain with each chain, and all the other things it implies.

Hi Mr. Puey,
So I think that Airbitz is really cool with its merchant integration. I've been wondering if you intend to do a desktop wallet ever? I've yet to spend Bitcoin in person, but I always have a desire to spend it somewhere besides casinos, Overstock, and eBay via eGifter. (I live in an [area]( with no BTC vendors to speak of, besides myself technically.)
I wonder if all the various merchant directories could consolidate. You guys just did a raise, IIRC, maybe you could try and get CoinMap and the others to work in closer proximity. 
I feel like our community is too fragmented for its size at present, and consolidated efforts like I speak of might actually contribute to growth moreso than news spikes. People see things that are very strong and work, they're attracted on that level already.

PR damage control for the future, then? Not a bad idea. All things being equal, though, it's not the worst idea at this point for Blockstream to re-evaluate its approach to the situation. As someone who is just amazed that all this works at all, that we really do have an alternative and somewhat thriving currency mode in the world and that it can do so much more, I don't place too much stake in it all. I think it's a shame things are going this way. 
Edit: what I mean mostly by this last bit is that I will get behind anything that works and puts this debate to bed, so long as it works. I will get behind a consensus. Consensus never seems to involve, in my experience, one side making too many more concessions than other, when there are clearly defined camps.
I heard a rather prolific (as I understand it) BSD developer on TechSNAP (Jupiter Broadcasting in the house?) talking recently about how once they'd started having face-to-face meetings some years back, annually or something, it was a lot easier to reach real solutions as opposed to having forever-long and repetitive arguments.

That's the fundamental problem with Uber versus Cabs. These are not employees, these drivers. They are features of an app in this twisted new reality where the service industries that largely subsist on tipping don't deserve it anymore. Out of the other side of your mouth you'll extol the benefits of hard work, though, I'm sure. 
I think Uber will eventually be fucked out of business by the competition. I've not read much about Lyft so far. But in a given city if I can catch a regular cab, I will do that until it is no longer possible, no matter the cost. 
Because if they can't get a job driving a taxi the regular route, there is a reason for that, and if I don't have enough respect to tip a driver, there had better be a damn good reason for that. 
Let these industries go.

I agree with everything you've said. I stand by what I've said, as well. 
As an anarchist, without any of the annotations, someone who simply advocates a society without government in [this style]( more than any, situationist in philosophy, I don't want centralized solutions to any problem.
But I do acknowledge there are problems that need solving, such as the disabled who cannot contribute to society, and whose families have abandoned them. Any system which does not account for them will fail before it begins, as humans are social creatures. 
I don't believe in systems that go against natural urges. Humans are pleasure seeking, work-avoiding creatures. Leftists ignore this fact and for this I abhor them, while rightists and market-oriented libertarians focus too much on it, and for this I distance from them. 
I believe the future is brighter the more people lose faith in government and invest said faith in themselves and humanity instead.

Will we be hearing this very same statement from you in December when their positions remain unchanged and no solution has yet been implemented? 
This whole thing reminds me of political brinksmanship you see when the government has to print more money just to keep us from figuring out how utterly impossible their system is to maintain for perpetuity. To the point that they'll let the fucking military go unpaid, which in other countries where they thought it'd never happen, would easily lead to a coup d'etat. 
So I mean, I hope you're right. I hope it's really that they just don't have a solution yet, and that they don't want to "break Bitcoin" by going too quickly in any given direction. 
But I think it's also possible that the art of programming is shared by tens of thousands if not more worldwide and these special flowers may need some replacing if we're to truly continue the task at hand, putting money back in the hands of its owners.

He shouldn't be constantly amazed. The dominant narrative will always enjoy the most forgiveness. 
That said, if you're not willing to seriously address the concerns of the people you aim to lead, you're just not going to get the opportunity to lead them. People will take a broken promise from Obama over a "I can't fix that" from a contender any day. 
Mankind deserves better than any of the current political offerings, and hopefully through technology we will reach a homeostasis that doesn't leave so many unfulfilled from cradle to grave. Selfishness is not a virtue, but healthy self-interest is important. This remains true even when people work against their own self-interest. 
There is a lack of intelligent libertarians who also refuse to do business with the govenrment. That is to say, they will not take a government contract. They will not participate in the system at all. They will not take a tax break. This would be against their self-interest, and so the system perpetuates itself by appeasing them with what amount to subsidies and by pleasing the poor with what amount to table scrap handouts. 
Anyone who thinks that Americans will accept a return to 1905 conditions is both naive and deluded. All political power flows from the barrel of a gun.

I've seen it mentioned somewhere that the true cost of mining BTC comes out to around $180 at present. Someone give me a real figure if I'm wrong. Anyway, we're not that far above that number. Too much lower and people will be better off just holding, finding some other way to compensate for the cost to mine. In my view, while anything can happen, we're already pretty much partying on the bottom floor, and this elevator goes a lot higher.

So there was this guy and his furniture store. He was there a long time, no competition. Then one day a store opens up next door, huge, and he starts to lose some business there. Not enough to care. So he doesn't worry about it. Then on the other side of his business, another damn furniture store opens up, so much so that now if you're walking by, you can't really even tell there's three different stores. He realizes he could quickly go out of business this way. What does he do? He puts a sign over his door that says "main entrance."
That's guerilla marketing.
So is this. I know those guys are pro-Bitcoin from their other materials. So this is some kind of brilliant bait and switch. The clever doubtful customer goes in, thinking they're there to learn about why Bitcoin is bad, but for some reason they start to appreciate the value of Bitcoin through this free report.

It's no different than being pessimistic about any other additional layer to any other protocol. The bottom line is that additional layers must fill a need that the underlying protocol *cannot* fulfill itself. It's been established that in the short term a block size increase can sustain the transaction load; it has not been established that LN is *necessary* for this purpose. As has been said elsewhere, simple logic follows that LN and block size increases are not incompatible in a *technical* sense.

No different than saying Kim Dotcom was a pirate by proxy and pressuring Paypal and the others to cut off with him, or that Ross Ulbricht was some kind of kingpin drug dealer when he only ever sold a batch of mushrooms himself, except these people on the Craigslist competitor will literally have no other way to get their businesses going.
So they'll go back to the traditional way of doing it, standing on the street.  More of them will be harmed, which will mean more business for law enforcement. More of them will be caught, which will mean more business for law enforcement. The same amount or more will go into the sex trade, as the overwhelming evidence suggests that prohibition does not equal elimination.
More business for law enforcement means less money for everyone else. 
Less money for everyone else means less money for prostitutes. Except it doesn't, since psychologically we just tend to spend on our vices no matter how much they cost. 
So less money for everyone else equals the same situation. 
So this is a really bad idea for everyone except law enforcement, who are already overpaid, underworked, and generally full of shit. 
The best part is they're just a few years away from none of this mattering. Whether you do it via Backpage or you do it on the street, CCTV or NSA will know about it.

The answer to the first question is a positive sign. Personally I've never felt the need to send a free transaction. I thought it through and even if I lived to see 1 satoshi = $1, I still wouldn't feel like I'd done something stupid by paying a fee. I also don't mind tipping cab drivers or paying for shipping. I guess I might be illustrative of an old proverb about a fool and his money or something. 
Actually, I have done free transactions a few times, when paying Coinbase because the merchant didn't have Bitpay. 
To the second answer, this is interesting. I think a lot of people would like to know the following (from you specifically): you would consider a situation in which users can't send a free transaction through to be a sign of an unhealthy network?

Why is it a problem? By outlining the actual costs the original article is referring to, we see that they're just using scare tactics to inflate "the cost of powering 1.57 American households" to make it seem that Bitcoin is not viable. Something tells me there is a lot more electricity just powering ATMs in the world than there is in Bitcoin mining. This isn't to say that both these activities shouldn't continually be improved, but it's not a detrimental cost at present. People are still finding it a profitable activity to mine, just by virtue of mining itself. Thus they will still do it. Now, if their ability to profit were to die off tomorrow, then we'd see a similar sharp decline in people who were still mining. So what I'm saying is that while it is a problem, and it does cost too much, it's not a problem that can't be solved. It's not a problem like the original article is saying it's a problem. There are many things which we once lived without which use more electricity than 1.57 American households. For that matter, I bet you American households use 1.57 as much electricity as some other households. If they haven't stopped selling electricity, this is not a problem. 
If you want to talk about the real problem in electronics, talk about wasted water in PCB production.

Anyway, I'd pick up dog shit in the dog park by the pound, some rational rate for it like $0.25 per pound or something. There'd have to be some system to ensure I hadn't brought in shit from elsewhere, of course, so you'll have to tack on a bit more for that, for a regular employee to oversee these workers in a given area.

Both Coinbase and Circle are subject to the same pressure that Visa and Mastercard are buckling under. Maybe you could have some old krone go and educate them all on how to use their own wallets, and then ensure them against theft. Really, there's some kid like the one in Dope the movie who's got a huge business opportunity ahead of him, in the education of prostitutes industry. Just teach them all how it actually works. They'll pay attention. It's their money.
As to cashing out, they'll be stuck with LocalBitcoins, won't they? In the end, as ever, all the traditional methods will fail them so long as what they're doing is unregulated and technically illegal.

I notice you have a disturbing tendency to change the subject. 
You previously implied that by hard forking into the broader human consensus here (there, and everywhere), those who wrote and implemented such a fork would be "taking money out of the hands of its owners." This is a failure in logic since a hardfork will not be "necessary" assuming consensus is reached through other means. If you can't admire the willingness of some developers to go out on a limb and speak the truth about what's happening, it's probably because you stand to lose something. 
Garzik here is pointing out there is something wrong with the process, and so we're going to see get something bad in the pudding, and there is more than one group who advocate no change because they've built out their own solutions, by which they will profit. And all you guys want to do is say, "No. Don't worry. I work for Bitcoin Inc. and we have a PERFECT solution which will rescue you once we create a situation in which it's absolutely essential. Doesn't matter if you don't like, because we have the means of obstruction." 
You know after reading this whole thread I think we're actually overblowing this. We're not going to have to worry about increased transaction volume because people are going to have increasingly less interest in a community that carries on like this, and yes, I'm referring to the developers, not the discourse here in the Reddit comments.

That's not really my concern... it's that I think this is an awesome idea, because my ONLY gripe with Uber has always been how it treats labor and still gets praise from seriously retarded hipsters drinking their vegan frappé out of environmentally friendly cups, and this concept solves it and then some. I've never bitched about Lyft as much because they let the driver make up fro the middle man tax by accepting, or even encouraging tips, which is common across all service industries in the same that it's common for carpenters to use pencils, but Uber specifically wants to crush even that bit of agency the drivers may have had. For all the glorification, Uber would LOVE a world where one cannot get a paid ride without Uber. I mean in my town one company owns three cab brands, are they decentralized too?
Arcade City is all idea, not enough work, at this point. Presumably because the dude is still trying to find stable work. But he definitely had a lot of great ideas in that video and I would love to see it spread. I just think putting out a blob of HTML and expecting the community to respond is perhaps not well-planned.

That's fine. I was just clearing up the confusion for you. Your fees are not what is meant when we refer to a subsidy at this time. In many years time the fees will be the only incentive for miners to mine, and therefore will become much more important than they are now. Because of the mining reward/subsidy, fees are incredibly low now. I think that by the time fees are the only incentive to mine, mining chips will be able to do a lot more with a lot less ~~power~~ energy, and so things will find an equilibrium of sorts.

Probably it won't. The majority of Bitcoin transactions are not urgent, and those that are will pay the fees to go with it. I think trying to turn those that believe there needs to be some movement on this issue in the other direction (rather than the sitting on our thrown cuz we wanna direction) into those that simply don't want to pay fees is an absurd way to frame the whole thing. 
It's ignorant to expound about the passion of the developers and at the same time to give some kind of moral argument as to why they have the RIGHT to make it such that I would rather use their 2nd layer than transact directly on the block chain. If that passion is legitimate it will not go away simply because the project is forked. If that passion is legitimate it will manifest itself in some other way no matter the circumstances. Fact is a lot of people see Bitcoin as a lot of different things, but to this day, despite the recent "settlement layer and the art of meta-trolling" bullshit we've all been subjected to, one of the most public forums describe it as this: "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. "
Currency. Digital money. Meaning I can give it DIRECTLY to you and you can give it DIRECTLY to someone else, and for the whole thing to make sense in this regard, we keep a public ledger. Does that imply coffee on the block chain? I don't particularly give a fuck about all of that. 
What I know for sure is that this argument has ascended from a technical issue. Core wants a pledge of support from the in-the-middles they need to commit to put an end to the troll war, sort their house out, and STICK to the scaling plan. Stop all this, "What would it be without us" nonsense, because with a buffalo this big, there will be hunters who can kill it, even if it takes more -- how much more or less does 10 volunteer developers cost than one? Fuck off with your emotional nonsense. They could all die of heart attacks right now, and Bitcoin would live on. 
Do you fucking know why? Because it's open source. And hard forks are not different because of this fucking particular fucking open source project, and they are not more or less legitimate because of it. Bitcoin dies with its developers the day they write the whole thing from scratch and patent the motherfucker without using prior art. 
Fuck everyone. Good night.

And yes I understand that it would ultimately be safer for them to store their money as BTC, and that for those who have pimps it would give them a chance to get away from them, but this is beside the point. In reality, they just want to be paid for what they do, like anyone doing anything. Bitcoin is not optimum for them at the moment, but it could be. 
Perhaps before long other parts of their industry will start being affected by payment processors. The motels they use might be next on the attack list, for instance. 
Anyway I'm just saying that they only need Bitcoin like you need quarters to use laundry machines here where I live. Otherwise why the hell would I want this many quarters? I hope that makes sense.

I suppose that means history will make an exception for it, then. Perfect. A fail-safe investment. Let me go in a little deeper. [What could go wrong?]( 
Note that any post which references Latter Day Bitcoin Saints and doesn't rely on sound historical analysis (e.g., the world existed before 2009, no matter what the block chain says) will be ignored by me. Probably any other post.

Product is what is left over when the dust settles and the pulse returns to normal, when the day is done, when the coffin is laid in the ground. We do not exist in the settling dust or the scorecard; we are here in the present tense, in the making, the doing, the feeling. Just as we try to immortalize ourselves by fleeing into the world of fixed, deathless images, we try to externalize ourselves by thinking in terms of the results of our actions rather than our experience of the actions themselves. After all, it's so complicated to have to worry about whether you are really enjoying yourself, how you are feeling in the moment. It is easier to focus on the results, the hard evidence of your life; these things seem easier to understand, and easier to control.
Modern society is centered around the production and distribution of material goods, rather than the happiness and satisfaction of its participants. thus Modern man thinks of his life in terms of what he has "to show for it," rather than considering the life itself.
Of course today's average worker is used to thinking about the ends rather than the means. He spends most of his time and energy working at a job that in all likelihood does not fulfill his dreams. He looks forward to payday every two weeks, for he counts on his paycheck to make sense out of his life: without it, he would feel like he was wasting his time. If he didn't look at the "consequences" of his actions as a justification for them, life would be unbearable-what if he constantly considered how he was feeling as he bagged groceries, or asked himself if he was having fun every moment he struggled with the fax machine? Insofar as his everyday experience of life is tedious and meaningless, he needs to concentrate on the coming weekend, the next vacation, his next purchases, to fend off insanity. And eventually he is bound to generalize that mode of thinking to other parts of his life: he comes to evaluate possible actions according to the rewards they offer, just as he would evaluate a job according to the wage it offers.
Thus, the present has lost almost all significance for modern man. Instead he spends his life always planning for the future: he studies for a diploma, rather than for the pleasure of learning; he chooses his job for social status, wealth, and "security," rather than for joy; he saves his money for big purchases and vacation trips, rather than to buy his way out of wage slavery and into full time freedom. When he finds himself experiencing profound happiness with another human being, he tries to freeze that moment, to turn it into a permanent fixture (a contract), by marrying her. On Sundays he goes to church, where he is told to do good deeds in order to one day receive eternal salvation (as NietzsChe says, the good Christian still wants to be paid well), rather than for the sheer pleasure of helping others. The "aristocratic disregard for consequences," that ability to act for the sake of action that every hero possesses, is far beyond him.

Basically I'm coming over from Electrum due to some weird, scary problems I've had with it recently. I'll continue to see how Electrum works for me with future updates, but I'm not comfortable with it at present. The other day I had to open up the wallet file with a text editor and change the encrypt setting from true to false ... but the strange part of that was that my wallet had indeed been password protected prior to that, so I didn't think I'd be able to just do that. Then I was trying to send a transaction from an imported private key, and it would just hang on the send. I dig Electrum, I have a lot of respect for the developer Thomas V., but for now, I'll be moving back over to Bitcoin Core and/or Armory.
tl;dr If you notice your Bitcoin Core is using a lot of CPU resources, it's probably because you're syncing the blockchain.

Building the core tools upon which millions of dollars per day are transmitted is work that does not warrant pay? But, you know, making Flappy Birds, for which the developer made $50K per day, that is work worthy of pay?
Bitcoin Core is not even the best wallet client at the moment, I'll give you that. bitcoind is actually the real value of what that team produces. But to say that "Gavin doesn't need pay" is foolish, short-sighted, and wrong. If Gavin doesn't need pay, and if the many people who have profited incredibly from his efforts can't afford to pay him, then Bitcoin doesn't need to exist. 
Similar things were said about Linus Torvalds when he moved to the United States. Most people forget that he first worked for a private company called Transmeta before the Linux Foundation was started. He was a skilled and wanted man who could have left the job anytime, but one of the reasons he liked working there is they were very much in favor of him working on the Linux kernel. It wasn't until 2003 that he moved to a company which would later become the Linux Foundation. To this day, he is instrumental in the forward momentum of Linux kernel development, but that is not all he has done, and I should note that literally millions of websites benefit from his contributions and have for the entire existence of what we today call the internet. His other major contribution to the software world is a little thing called Git. You may have heard of it. 
My point is that the software Linus has created has subsequently generated billions and billions of dollars in revenues by doing what other software cannot or what will be very costly for a small company starting out could afford. Thanks to Linus, a start-up could run a server that worked as expected without paying crazy fees to IBM or Sun or even Microsoft. His work was so well respected that Red Hat gave him stock options worth millions of dollars. To this day they are one of the leading open source companies, and many of the Linux core developers are also employees of the company.
He never expected this when he started, similar to how Satoshi never expected it, and surely Gavin did not expect it when he began work on Bitcoin Core. But their work is valuable, their contributions real, and unless or until others step in to fill their shoes, no one has the right to say "they don't need pay."

eBay is an interesting example. I started using it in the summer of 2004. Back then, you could pay by check or money order to many sellers, and that was how I preferred to do it, because legally, as a minor, I could only get a savings account, and certainly not a credit card of any type. eBay's buyer protection came years later, and in my opinion it's extreme at this point, but back then the rating system was the number one way to know if someone was good or not. I only remember one purchase I was truly dissatisfied with, and I left the feedback to show it. It was supposed to be a real copy of the Bad Religion Into the Unknown album (rare as hell) for too cheap. I  probably didn't read the listing right, stoner kid that I was, but I was mad to get a burned CD of the MP3s I had already pirated! 
Anyway, eBay's a bad example, because it is a bazaar of sellers. What you need for an example is a start-up.
In that case, I think multi-sig pretty much covers it. If that's not good enough, we do have BitPay, CoinBase, BitNet, and others in Europe, all of which offer a lot of protection to both buyer and seller. 
Start-ups have to earn their reputation one way or another. I, for one, don't advocate eliminating banks so much as I advocate giving cryptocurrencies a fair chance. After all, in our personal lives, that's all that most of us are doing, isn't it? Few and far between are those living solely on Bitcoin with as few fiat conversions as possible.

Seems clear that by now he'd be at odds with many, if not most, other developers, therefore his was a wise personal decision. Then there's the fact that he started [dumping Bitcoin some time ago]( (last two paragraphs). Probably another wise decision, all things considered. 
I think it's irrelevant whether he "should" or "shouldn't have," despite everything. It's obviously not a position of true power. It's a voluntary position and at this point, I don't envy Wladimir or any of the other developers. This community is 10x as tone deaf and coarse as other comparable software endeavors, blows things 100x out of proportion, and isn't bothered by lack of technical insight or scientific proof. 
One has to wonder where the "scale or die" motive begins and ends. As Luke-Jr continues to point out, the nodes have the data. The data confirms that Bitcoin is working. The fee market idea may be underdeveloped, but one thing you can't say about it is that it will make Bitcoin less accessible to the average user. Furthermore, no matter what Gavin Andresen says, it is not desirable that the majority of users trust SPV wallets. That is indeed contrary to the very basics of Bitcoin, which rely on a widely decentralized block chain. 
I think a positive thing for to do would be to prove that it's a trivial process to make the next block increase by writing the patch now -- as he would write it in comparison to how Gavin Bell has written it. Then people can stop insisting that it's such folly to wait until the patch is actually necessary, except those with a dog in the hunt, who are going to insist that miner-centralization-friendly initiatives are necessary no matter WTF happens.

Ever read The Flash of Genius? It turns out that gold can be extracted from any dirt anywhere. The market price of gold determines how valuable in terms of gold a piece of land is. If the gold price tripled today you would see a great deal of mining in unexpected places. There is gold in this phone I'm using. Gold has been mined for over a thousand years and is still actively being mined. There is limitless gold in space. My point? Gold is perceived as rare, largely by the middle class who see it as a stable store of value. Bitcoin on the other hand is actually rare, like a 67 Chevelle in working order. This whole debate is further proof that multiple cryptocurrencies are the future, no matter what Bitcoin maximalists say.

Defining it in these terms is roundly ridiculous. Regular people can use whatever wallet they have time to learn. 
The proliferation of wallets, as far as I can see, has much more to do with who is introducing people to Bitcoin. If it's your first experience you're most likely going to want to use whatever the guy explaining it to you uses and recommends. 
Those who come to it on their own, like myself, wind up trying several wallets before finding one that does everything they want. I used Electrum for awhile, had a problem that scared me even though I didn't lose anything, and moved to MultiBit. I wound up hating the MultiBit UI over time, and finally gave Armory a shot. Armory doesn't lack any features for me.

This is most certainly arguable.
Made a deposit on an exchange lately? I've literally missed opportunities waiting for confirmation.
DarkCoin has InstantX, and I think, long-term, Bitcoin Core is going to be taking some code from DarkCoin, or it will start to slip.
Man, I have to admit I cringed when I saw that "network effect" mantra dropped here. 
I think the question is deeper than that. My answer is that the Bitcoin experiment is only just beginning, and it's getting the most attention, and thus the most investment. Also, much of the alt coin space spends too much time worrying about how people value them in Bitcoin, which means that no matter how you look at it, Bitcoin's either going to be worth more than it or the alt is going to be irrelavent. Competing on equal footing, there are coins that have the potential to give Bitcoin real competition, but as I said, this game has only really just begun. 
Just a couple years ago, a major investor had the fear, with crypto, of losing it all to regulators on a whim. Now that things are more clear, I think, well, Gentlemen, start your engines. And I don't fully believe that the team behind Bitcoin are necessarily the most creative or motivated. In fact, being rich at this point might be their biggest liability.

This is particularly funny: 
The reason I find it funny is that it puts all this trust in but leaves out that whole massive foul-up with the new forum software never materializing. While I'm willing to bet it wasn't completely Michael's fault, in the end his name was on that whole thing. Therefore, it's at least as bad as Roger Ver promoting "inferior coded wallets" (definitely subjective, as the recent poll determined) and vouching for Gox, isn't it? But yet says this:
"Still, comparing u/theymos to Roger, I think it's clear u/theymos has a proven track record of always trying to do what is best for Bitcoin, regardless of potential monetary gain. Many important former figures trusted him enough to give him control of major Bitcoin platforms."
Whole thing is ridiculous. 
1. Theymos CAN be ousted if Reddit feels it's in their interest to do. All this "his" and "private property" talk regarding a sub-reddit needs to just cease. It's not founded on real logic. The truth of the matter is that if 90% of redditors who frequent here really wanted Theymos removed as mod, and mobilized to do such, well, that's what would happen. Keep your examples to yourself -- it's a click of a few buttons for them, massive effort for the forum, but it's definitely possible. Let me state clearly I don't have a problem with Marquadt or with his handling of At the same time, I may be just be the last guy in that old poem about "no one was left to speak for me," meaning that I should probably have more sympathy for those who are getting banned despite earnestly discussing Bitcoin. 
2. This is not Honestly, I get thoroughly annoyed at the circle-jerky customer service calls we see here, as well as other what basically amounts to advertising. I've said as much to their representatives before. Coinbase does not equal Bitcoin, this much needs to be stated clearly. In fact, there is a logical argument that Coinbase presents real problems for Bitcoin. 
3. What kind of board seriously tolerates the public antics of someone like Armstrong? When he's not randomly insulting other cryptocurrencies (for no gain!), he's picking fights on Reddit and taking positions on what are unarguably very contentious issues. This is not what serious CEOs do. A serious person would be focusing on a serious strategy for after the VC money goes away. Dot com bubble saw hundreds of companies get showered with millions and then never turn an actual profit, or continue to secure capital. I'd LOVE to see more talk here and elsewhere about competitors coming up and eating Coinbase's lunch. Hopefully they'd have someone a little more thoughtful at the helm. 
Okay, so my inability to stomach the bald dude's nonsense is not grounds to ban him or discussion of Coinbase. If you think that, you're right. I also think that the inability to tolerate "big blockers" or whatever is a bad reason to ban discussion of block size increase or people who insist on it. Reddit actually has a function built in to deal with stuff that's not helpful: the down arrow. Took me a few months to figure out what the arrows were for, personally, but I'd prefer that be the only method of judgement used for stuff that is at least tangenitally related to Bitcoin.
On the other hand, it's perfectly fine for ShapeShift's CEO to post random articles he's read about Tim Cook and Theymos says nothing as it stays on the front page for over 12 hours.

Never, ever, ever leave your coins in an exchange. This is why so many people lost money to Mt. Gox and others.

Never share your private key. Never share your private key. Never share your private key.
Encrypt your wallet. 
Don't use Bitcoin Core. Just don't. There are better, lighter solutions. 
Don't worry about mining unless you've got a lot to invest.
Don't be tempted by anything which promises to double your bitcoins or anything which offers to pay more for them than they are presently selling at market. 
Always research before you make your next move.

Being documented does not mean you have to go to public school, or private school for that matter. Being undocumented means that if you screw up once in your life you have less rights than a foreigner with a country to which you can be deported. 
Parents should not force their ideals on their kids. You prepare them for the world that exists, not the one you believe should. My ex best friend's parents were idealists. He wasn't allowed to eat meat as a child, and though he's tried as an adult, he simply doesn't have the enzymes in his stomach, he pukes. He hates that, he'd have preferred to decide that for himself. In an ultimate feat of irony, he resents his parents because, and I quote, "they prepared [him] for a world that doesn't exist." 
If this actually had anything to do with the kids and their rights, anyway, we wouldn't be reading about it online. It'd just be something they did, not a subject of their fucking blog.

Quick answer: I'm not hiding the amount of Bitcoin I have from the government or anyone else. I don't care who knows.

There's many flaws in this. 
1) We are here for Bitcoin. This is the biggest forum for it. If one of the Bitcoin alternative subreddits were to get as big, we'd migrate there eventually, just like everyone else. 
2) It doesn't matter what rules they acquired it by. Reddit owns this space, operates the server. If Reddit went out of business in a couple of hours and the mods bought the domain, then you could say this belonged to them. Many are arguing the opposite. I'm not among them. I'm merely stating that people who think Theymos or any of the other mods are owed some kind of special respect for merely being the first to create a Bitcoin subreddit, they're foolish, and there IS recourse. 
At the same time, I should note that I don't think the new rules are in poor taste. I think they're somewhat reasonable, even if I believe they're unnecessary, they're nothing I can't agree to. Regardless, if the overwhelming majority of the people who visit this page felt the other way, they could appeal to the actual owners of the space. 
Reddit is a mortgage-free house, a subreddit is an apartment. BitcoinTalk, on the other hand, that is another house.

The next thing would be a post about how Bitfinex and others were acting like fascists. It would be a whole conspiracy.
So my estimation is pretty simple: the price will rebound once these coins are done cycling through the market. If they're being picked up by regular speculators, they'll get sold back at incrementally higher prices. If they're being picked up by long-term holders, all the better.

It's funny, when those FTC rules came out, I was a regular old fiction writer. The concern for the people at HTMLGiant.com and other places was that they would have to disclose who gave them what books that they reviewed. I dunno if they ever complied or not, but I know that most of the people on Reddit and elsewhere are pretty stupid about how these rules actually apply and what the consequences can be. 
I haven't even reviewed the articles where Scott Fargo reviewed GAW equipment, but I can tell you that CCN itself has very clear guidelines. In fact, when I write about Netcoin or any other coin I have which isn't Bitcoin (because it's impossible for one of our articles to move the Bitcoin market), I have to disclose that. Even DarkCoin I have to disclose that I hold.
So if the FTC were to decide Scott violated their rules, he also violated CCN's.

Agree. People who invest in precious metals and such tend to have this belief that there is a breaking point. The fact is that nobody wants the collapse to happen, so nobody will believe it's going to happen, and if it does happen, there's nothing they won't do to reverse it. The value of everything is relative to the belief in everything. No matter how bad it gets, people don't seem to stop believing, where I live, in the United States. This generation of people wouldn't riot if you came and took their children and their guns on the same day and left a bag of shit in their driveway on the way out. They have no heart, no real moral fiber, so whatever the government comes up with to write off this problem, whatever made-up scheme they bail it all out with this time, it will work. Two generations ago they got everyone hooked on social security, last generation they added in food stamps and other stuff like that, and now they've got an ever-growing array of technological distractions to keep the minds occupied. Anyway you look at it, none of these people want to see the dream end, and so, truthfully I don't believe it will.

You put a dollar in a safe and the next day it's still worth a dollar. You put a dollar in Bitcoin and the next day it could be worth 90 cents. I get that the dollar suffers this as well, but not in a way that is as noticeable / has as much effect. For instance, paying bills. If your monthly storage maintenance fee is say $700, it's going to stay that way for awhile. You wouldn't want to set aside a few BTC and be dicked over by the market fluctuation. 
These past few months of stability were not the norm by any means. 
So it shouldn't be surprising that people would rather pay high costs to secure their cash than they would to buy a ton of Bitcoin. Not everyone feels that way, of course.

It's also against eBay policies. 
One time I bought a power tool and it took a very long time to ship by eBay standards. In a WTF moment, I asked the guy what was going on, and he lied, so then I realized this tool was actually Harbor Freight. Harbor Freight is cheap and sometimes their stuff isn't so bad, but the thing is, they take forever to ship unless you pay a lot of extra money for the shipping. And then they are forever having inventory issues because they actually sell a lot of product. 
Well, guy was rude, so I looked it up, and my suspicion was right: you can't sell something on eBay unless you actually have it within your possession/control. So selling something you haven't actually bought yet, on eBay, is totally against the rules.

2014 was a pretty ugly year for Bitcoin. 2015 has good development after good development. 
But you should ask yourself: what can you do to improve this perceived problem, and is there a way you can profit from it? The Bitcoin price is at an ideal entry level for people. Perhaps offer classes for a nominal fee in your community, or something.
But what you do in that moment when you realize that all your problems can be blamed on others? Reconsider your realization!

I agree with you, but more than once the actual "great customer service" was purely a result of the drive to save face. In some cases the customer tried customer service before posting here.

Say it with me: bitcoin monagamy.
Every time he gets an STD from one of his altcoin girlfriends, or hears of a friend getting in trouble with one of them, he runs back to his wife BITCOIN and reaffirms his love.
Bitcoin could use some improvement, I hope that much is understood. And if you really think future generations are going to tolerate the richest people in an economy getting that way by pure luck of "early adoption," I think you're silly.
All in all, I think a variety of coins is not a bad thing. If the world tended toward one currency like some emotional Bitcoiners claim, then there'd be one world currency, and it'd likely not be the dollar -- more likely it'd be the Yuan or something. I mean, really study that shit and you start to realize exactly how much our military might plays into our currency's prevelance. 
In any case, no, sir, we can't agree that. I wish Darkcoin were accepted more places, because I'd own a lot more of it. Why? Because holy shit it's faster!

I think he's really referring to the massive leaps we once saw. It seemed like one day the 133mhz showed up and then before you knew it, 733mhz was affordable, and so on. While I agree with you that the quality of the chips has greatly improved, the cycles are kind of the same as they were a few years back -- 3.something being about the highest affordable regular one. So people compensate by going with extra cores. The Knights Landing super workstation has 72 cores and is capable of 3 teraflops.

I was infantry in Iraq and assigned to personal security detachment of the battalion commander for a time (and later the company commander). Two of the missions we did were literally handing out stacks of cash to local businesses, sheiks, homeowners, and community organizations. Trivial amounts in the scheme of the amount spent on the war, amounts between 500 and 10,000. 
I had the thought that if we can afford to do that there, why not do the same in some of our worst-off / most violent / least affluent communities. The answer is obviously that the ghetto justifies the expansion of the police state in the eyes of the fearful citizen / voter, but all the same.

Um. The vast majority of the internet is run by some variety of Linux.
Linux on the desktop is vastly more popular in less corrupt countries. 
You're leaving out all the backroom deals and Windows Taxes that people buying desktops have had to pay. If the government had done its job in the 90s, it would have gone full anti-trust, uncovered the backroom deals with Dell and the like, and forced Microsoft to refund any user willing to surrender their license. 
You go into Best Buy in the 90s and they tell you that you can pay $150 less for the computer if you simply install your own operating system. What are you going to say? That whole notion perverted the US computer market in the first place.
Linux also has a number of major companies. Redhat (RHT), Canonical, they are two prominent examples.
I could go on, but what's the point?

They were not able to withdraw for several days (as long as a week) leading up to the exit. Therefore, even though they'd sent their packages off and in some cases the packages were received, funds held in escrow were never received. 
Additionally, some of them had used the wallet for storage. Which is a bad idea, of course, always, but still doesn't excuse outright theft as some would insinuate.
The consumers also lost out, yes, because while a couple of the dealers went ahead and sent the packages anyway (to retain reputation and return customers), most of them didn't, and so the users essentially gave the money away.

Yes, they can. Common theme I've noticed is people acting like Theymos and crew actually own this space. In fact, they've not only got no skin it, Reddit historically has no issue stepping in if things get stupid, and they don't even need a "policy" to back them up. 
I've said it before and I'll say it again: anyone who really thinks there is a serious problem here, not just with censorship but with this subreddit misrepresenting the community somehow, they should collect signatures and contact actual Reddit staff. It's in Reddit's interest that this subreddit remain a destination for people interested in Bitcoin. 
Me, personally, I don't see this censorship as extreme enough to warrant a problem. But I do take issue with this continued idea that by being to the subdomain first, someone somehow owns it besides Reddit. That's just not how things work.

Halving is basically what it sounds like. The coinbase (mining) reward of blocks will be cut from 25 to 12.5 coins at some point in the future, which seriously affects the profitability of mining supposing the value of a single Bitcoin hasn't significantly risen by then.

What if we just make a really fancy message board or go back to trading via IRC? The truth is that putting our coins in centralized locations is what makes this possible in the first place. 
Or maybe: (hope they're listening) Coinbase or Bitpay buys and integrates Cryptsy and Poloniex. Because for now at least they have some real capital for reimbursment purposes in the event of hacks. But then again they do a bit of KYC. 
I like the way Cryptsy does KYC. But I'm not stuck on anyone exchange. When my coins are valuable I want to be able to safely trade them. I don't mind paying fees for the prvilege.

I don't think we have to rely on trust when it comes to software. Set a few parameters that are impossible to falsify in the server and client. When the user is connecting his client doesn't connect to servers with those parameters.
There's no obligatory incentive to running an electrum server at the moment. I've been thinking about starting one myself.

Roll back several years and make this same argument.
Most people at that time would be arguing that Bitcoin wasn't going to survive. 
And after some of the scandalous events of the last couple years, it shouldn't have. But it did. 
So to say that "bitcoin has won, everything else is just going to die off slowly" -- replace bitcoin with "the dollar" and you'll see where I'm going with this. Certain people have this crystal ball I just can't get access to. 
Bitcoin has horribly slow confirmation times at the moment and if this problem goes on for another year or so, serious merchants will start seriously considering crypto options in addition to Bitcoin.

I think you've made a safe decision. $328 is definitely achievable in the next year. If the price drops much further, buy more so that when it rebounds you can sell and keep your investment stable.

I see  now that we can add charities which don't already accept BTC.

Well, fine, but if it were me, I'd get a lawyer to go over the terms and conditions of my relationship with the bank and determine if they were acting within their rights or not. Even if they were, I'd sue to set a precedent that you don't have the right to freeze/limit someone's funds just because you don't like what they're doing with them -- it has to be illegal for you to have grounds to do that, and Bitcoin companies like Coinbase are, in fact, decidedly legal.

Well, the amount's relevant for those who might doubt what he's saying here. 21 BTC is not a trivial sum. It's worth suing over, worth involving the authorities over, worth going public over. But the thing is, I'm a doubting type, and so as soon as he said 21 BTC, I clicked the "imgur" link only to see the amount had been blocked out. In this case it doesn't make me doubt his entire story, but as a rule, it might.

I just want to let you all know that David Parker / Jonas is a genuine person. 
Scott Fargo and Josh Garza seem to have it in their heads that someone needs to contact anyone for comment in an op-ed. Note that the News category has to be used whenever an article is going on the front page. 
After Josh Garza gave him a bunch of crap, David contacted me to ask if I had tried to get in touch. As stated in the e-mails, I had written to the law firm, because the law firm is who Josh had blamed in his forum posts. Had he been taking responsibility, I might have contacted him, I might not have. 
The purpose of that article was very clearly to not leave our last writing on the matter as being a promise of something that never materialized. 
I work very hard at CCN, sometimes more than 10 hours in a day doing research and revising and such. 
I repeat: we don't have to ask your permission to write about you, as long as we don't lie. Josh Garza can lie all he wants, to all the people he wants, but he will only fool so many. 
Anyone that thinks we're not covering the right news is free to send us tips or to tip me directly at paul.madore

First time I actually went through with paying the fees to get everything off of Cryptsy after a day's trading. In my time Cryptsy hasn't done me wrong but that doesn't mean they're invulnerable to this hackery shit. Guess it's worth paying the fees to withdraw when you're not actively monitoring.

It's in the TOS. Like you said. Shit, son, if you're investing more than the cost of a smart phone, then get a damn smart phone and do 2FA. Or you can do it with Authy on browsers. I mean, they're not being unreasonable. You're actually saying the opposite. That guy could have just been trying to scam them. They implemented the policy for that reason, it sounds like. But I don't care for either side. Everyone: please don't be loyal to any exchange or currency. Always act ethically out of self-interest and the rest of us should be able to get along pretty well. There are decent exchanges out there, you know. None of them seem to be able to serve everyone at the same time. And then someone else comes along with another one promising this or that shiny. Use 2FA and do your best not to leave coins on the table when you're not looking. Bot trading sucks anyway. I fucking  hate watching bots rule the market. That kind of crap got us into the situation that necessitated Bitcoin in the first place.
