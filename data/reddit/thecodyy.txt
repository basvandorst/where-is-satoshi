Hey, I’ve been going through this too - what I did was just get a new debit card from my bank with new numbers. Fixed it right away. I know it’s not the most fun thing to do but it’s the only way. I waited over a month for them to reply before I just fixed it myself using this method..
They still haven’t gotten back to me FYI, but it works with my new card.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:32:12
This one flew over your head lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:16:13

@_date: 2017-11-10 18:23:13
Send it to me, I’ll take a look at it. :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:24:28
No, they’ve always shown a different and lower amount than it actually is. Fuck Coinbase. So shady.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:17:59
You must be really fun at parties

@_date: 2017-11-09 00:21:42
that’s why I️ don’t trust them!
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:30:09
I really hope so
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:57:41
Yes. Market manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:18:50
Glad it’s not just me. Phew
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:27:14
Andddddd I️ need to update my phone.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:53:55
I have the Trezor, (it’s a usb wallet) they’re about $80 on Amazon. Once you have it you can transfer your funds to it easily! It comes with instructions :)

DP here, what’s up fellow industry mate,
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:21:49
Whoever downvoted my comment about avoiding Coinbase is an idiot and good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:29:51
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:48:04
Avoid Coinbase. Get a wallet. Use gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:07:33
lol wow.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:13:12
Hodl the phone*
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:17:14
Don’t trust Coinbase man. Shady company.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:14:29
This. I wish more people would realize!
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:39:32
This guy doesn’t meme :(
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:15:37
It’s not “undervalued”.  I’m willing to bet they sell it at that price and pocket the remaining *actual* price 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:32:43
I like you.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:34:04
I️ just got it! Still learning bud, I️ appreciate your knowledge 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:55:46
He doesn’t. He’s an idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:59:26
You ok? Tough morning?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:05:43
Thank you! Coinbase is such a joke.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:36:24
Really appreciate it, that was super helpful and informative!
Can you suggest an easy way to store? I only have about $500 invested, I read somewhere that breadwallet may be fine for that amount?
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:21:58
interesting. they actually completely removed one of my cards.
Do you recall how long you had to wait before buying again?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:10:29
Awesome, thank you so much for the info!
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:38:42
Perfect, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:50:31
Stop using coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:02:45
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:39:31
Well I have a pretty fair complaint.. not being able to buy or sell is kind of an issue
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:22:44
just signed up, does it really take 2 weeks to verify my identity?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:07:59
So should I only be using gdax and a wallet like the nano?
