If they want to have a legit business with no issues from law enforcement the last thing they want is people doing things that are against the law of the united states (where they happen to be based) on their platform.
I see a major risk of them centralizing the network and/or practising censorship in order to protect themselves and their business.

But then their service is still the dominant one and likely no longer compatible with the decentralized version.

What guarantees do we have that they won't stop releasing the source and centralise openbazaar once it becomes popular enough? The code is MIT licenced so legally they can do that without any issues.
They could decide that the whole decentralised aspect is too hard for the average person to use or will want to prevent people from selling illegal things on their platform.
I'm sure the developers mean well but the investors who want their money back might have other priorities.

What exactly did you give them in return for the money?

Why not make a better alternative instead of demanding that someone  resign? Even if they resign, what happens if their replacement is worst?
If you can make a much better alternative to bitcointalk people will most likely switch.

Windows dominates the consumer market which is where all the potential users of openbazaar are.

What are these huge blocks of line break? 
They are everywhere in the code.
This comment don't make any sense: 
What does this do? 
What are those variable names? 
This is obviously code written by a beginner. It looks like a good thing to write for fun but nobody should be using this seriously.

When will you release windows binaries?
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:22:41
Did you try py2exe? You really need to find a way to quickly build binaries for windows because it's where all the users are.

What happens if me and my sockpuppet bitmarket "accounts" spam random sellers with fake BidMsg ?
Your software looks too easy to exploit.

Most of the posts about new businesses accepting BTC are posted by the business itself or someone who really likes the business. Why would they go and post about it in some other less frequented sub?
These accepting posts are also excellent for bitcoin because it shows people that bitcoin is very alive.

It's inefficient.
The amount of power used to verify each transaction is insane and one central database would be much much more efficient and also faster than the entire bitcoin network.
It doesn't scale. Adding more CPU power and nodes to the network does not increase its capacity but rather makes it even more inefficient because every node mirrors what the others do.

This is what happens when you spend money on altcoins instead of bitcoin.

bittorrent bleep is closed source, they can claim anything they want and there's no way to verify their claims.
The recent uTorrent scandal shows that the bittorrent company isn't trustable.

Can someone give me a quick explanation what darkwallet is. What does it have over other bitcoin wallets?
It seems it's browser based. When you write software like bitcoin wallets the last thing you want is all the security issues that come with browser based software.
I'm interested in knowing why people seem so excited about this.

Not everyone has 24 hours a day access to the internet.
@_date: 2015-02-28 14:38:29
That sounds exploitable.
It also requires both parties to be online and have a way to communicate with each other unlike normal bitcoin which only requires the sending party being online.
