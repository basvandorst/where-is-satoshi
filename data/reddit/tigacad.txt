If anything, you'd want to compare the bitcoin hash rate to the ratio of bitcoin price to electricity price.

What kind of fluff/nonsense is it?  Have you checked?  What makes you confident the majority of the 900k+ aren't actual transactions?

You're mistaken.  If a small minority doesn't follow the same rules, their blocks will simply be rejected.  It is this mechanism that encourages consensus.  You don't need prior consensus.  This is the big mistake people are making with all the talk about contentious hard forks.  It doesn't matter at all if a fork is contentious *before* it happens, only *after.*  
Think of it like a presidential election.  Before the election, the country was 50/50 split on who they wanted to have as US president.  Incredibly contentious.  But after the election, the vast majority of the country accepts the new president as legitimate, and the small minority that don't are irrelevant.

It looks like blocks will soon fill up and we'll be facing a transaction backlog.

I disagree completely.  Bitcoin has convinced us that fiat and traditional banking are subpar and there's huge unmet needs.  If/when bitcoin fails, we'll still recognize those unmet needs, and when a clearly superior cryptocurrency is introduced, many will jump to it.  
We're almost at that point now.  Bitcoin blocks are almost full.  If bitcoin stops confirming new transactions in a reasonable amount of time, someone will create a new cryptocurrency that actually works for transactions.

There seems to be general confusion over the nature of contention and consensus.
Consider a US presidential election. Before the election, things are very contentious. Generally about 50% of the country favors the Democrat and 50% favor the Republican. But then the election happens, and most of the 49% who voted for the loser quickly accept the new president as their legitimate president. The legitimacy of the new president is not contentious after they're elected, and it is this legitimacy that matters.
Similarly, when a fork is proposed, miners and users can either choose to accept it or not. Most of the bitcoin ecosystem will accept whatever becomes dominant as legitimate. Most users don't have strong feelings about one implementation or another, and even if they do have strong feelings, they'll still accept the dominant implementation as the legitimate bitcoin.
The key to legitimacy (in both a presidential election and in bitcoin) is not in achieving consensus ahead of time, but rather that most people have faith in the process. The exception in US politics was in Gore v Bush when voters questioned whether their votes were counted. Similarly, a hard fork that occurs without open debate and under the threat of DDOS attacks and censorship may produce questions of legitimacy.

  I don't get why people keep repeating this nonsense about contentious forks.  Bitcoin is inherently democratic where votes are determined primarily by hashing power, and secondarily by what people who run full nodes and key economic sites (like exchanges) choose to do.  Bitcoin has **always** been built to evolve as a technology via this democratic process.  The vast majority of bitcoin users oppose the active choice of stagnation.  And let's not pretend that failing to innovate is anything other than an active choice to stagnate.  
  **All** innovation is "contentious" in that you'll never have 100% agreement before a change.  That's not important.  What is important is what happens *after* the switch is flipped.  Will the people who oppose the change get on board?  It's similar to in a democracy - half the country didn't vote for Obama, but the vast majority accepted him as our legitimate president.
  If a supermajority of 75%+ of bitcoin miners and users supports a change, that is a consensus of 75%+ of the community.  If the switch gets flipped, the majority of the dissenting 25% will quickly join the majority, similarly to Republicans accepting a democratic president as legitimate, even if he's not their first choice.  The fork would not be contentious in practice, it only looks contentious during the debating stage.
 
And your talk of "impatience" is silly.  We're on the brink.  Inaction is an incredibly aggressive and risky action to take.  If bitcoin blocks fill up and become relatively useless for typical transaction purposes, that could be permanently devastating to bitcoin.

Bitcoin is on the brink.  
Inaction is an incredibly aggressive and risky choice to make.  What happens when the memory pool becomes overloaded and transactions start getting dropped?  What happens if in 2 weeks, bitcoin becomes nearly useless for transacting?  Why is the status quo tolerable, and why should we trust anyone willing to idly watch this happen?  How can people talk about the risk of a contentious fork and ignore the risk of bitcoin becoming unusable through inaction?

Bitcoin is already clogging up.  Is SW ready to be implemented today?

almost emergency

It doesn't make sense to shape bitcoin around the temporary and largely arbitrary situation of hashing power in China.  That could easily change in a few months with a single new miner locating in iceland or somewhere with cheap power.

Can't the people running older nodes simply upgrade their software?  Is it difficult or time consuming to upgrade?
