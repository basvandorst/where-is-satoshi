Have you patented that already?

My point exactly! The number of transactions grew in 2015 much more than any previous year.

If you add more lights... this will work great in a music concert type scenario.

How much USD reserve they got?

Bitcoin will most likely breakout above $1000 ahead of July 10th Halving.
The media circus is only going to intensify between now and then.
The price will likely surge to $3000 - $5000 range before it corrects above $2000.

I hope not... ETHER pumps n dumps keeps hurting BTC on Coinbase GDAX.

Gemini is HANDS DOWN the BEST BITCOIN EXCHANGE.
Way better than Coinbase GDAX.

Overall, the Gemini.com site navigation is amazing, but the UX trading page needs little redesign to become more user friendly like GDAX.
I moved from GDAX to Gemini because Gemini doesn't impose stupid daily trading balance limits like GDAX.
You should advertise the "No Daily Limits" more if you want more customers.

Anyone else excited about July 10th Halving?
I can't wait...

I was new to Bitcoin in 2013 &amp; I can't remember how many Bitcoins I had in my Mt Gox account.
Any idea how to find out or who to contact?

Agreed. Bitcoin is ridiculously undervalued.
