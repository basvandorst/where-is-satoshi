I'd like to see the market capitalization dominance noted along the way too.

Basically yes but those percentages change depending which tax bracket you're in. I pay about 35% in my income tax and what I bring in from rentals and passive income can bump me up higher if I don't allocate and deduct properly.
The best thing you can do is start a business and rub your personal expenses through there (those that apply) in order to reduce your taxable income. 
So a guy like me may end up keeping 40 cents on every dollar if I'm not careful with day trading. 
Long term, long term, long term. Donate. Allocate. Invest. Start with the end in mind.

Thanks! But not quite...
I did place my final installments around the middle of November. I started in October with small positions in Ethereum and Litecoin when they were moving sideways. More recently I moved those positions into BTC because I saw that although they did in fact grow quite nicely, they have been on a consistent downtrend when measured against BTC growth.
To say I sold "half" is not mathematically accurate. I think my current holdings are about 1.3 BTC. I had sold about 1.08 BTC to catch my principal investment that I entered through a period of a couple months using a dollar-cost average method.

I bought in at 5.5k, 6.3k  7k. I dollar cost averaged into these positions. I also got ETH and LTC. Here's what you need to know:
- you can get ahead on BTC and other Cryptos with swing trades but the big retracements like this week, the SegWit2x pregasm, and the BCash flippening set you back if you're on the wrong side of the bounce. 
- Watch for big consolidation periods, its like shaking up a champagne bottle. When it pops the price overshoots and traces back down. Think of the 8k and 10k consolidation periods before they skyrocketed. But strong consolidation can also correct downward. With 8k it blasted through to 9.8 k. With 10k we saw much indecision. Now we're consolidating again around 11.
- I keep 1/4 to 1/3 of my holdings liquid in my USD wallet to buy the dips if there's a bounce after a retracement 20% or greater. 
- Consider cashing out during big consolidation periods especially when there's controversy like with forks. You'll have a rebuy opportunity at lower rates or you'll pay a reentry fee. Think of this as insurance. 
Best of luck to you and I wish the moon for you!

Thanks, I just wanted to clarify something and add to something.
-When I say keep 1/3 to 1/4 of your investment liquid I meant to say keep 1/3 to 1/4 of your principal investment liquid. So if you have 1000 invested. Keep 333.33 (repeating of course) to 250 liquid. Your investment will grow but then...
- You can dollar cost average your profits out to recover your principal investment and take profits. If you invested 1k this December and next December it's grown 3x (3000) then go ahead and pull out 300 and pay yourself back. Budget that however you like, put some towards your USD reserves or use it. Remember you haven't actually made any money until you convert to USD OR BTC has become mainstream and transact able.
-Finally to add I just wanted to say that you should START with THE END in mind. How much BTC do you want to own? How much do you plan to take out when it grows and when do you plan to take it out? WHY are you investing in BTC?
For me I'm planning on paying off my mortgage and accelerating improvements on my properties. Once that happens there's no need for me to play the risky game any more so I'll reduce my holdings, quit my job, live on my passive income, train BJJ all day, or go back to school - whatever. My point is I just want to escape the Matrix. That's my why. And BTC is not the only vehicle I'm using towards that endeavor.

I'm talking to my tax guy this week. The news about the IRS just dropped so I want to find out before April 15th what the tax is on cap gains. it also depends on your income bracket. I'll update after my meeting.

use GDAX. It's the backend of Coinbase and transactions are instant.

That's quick math

Yeah, I figured it's just the holidays' lulls. December sucks for investing
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:38
Agree, down about 40% atm

Hold ETH, it's correlated to BTC in its movements. So is LTC. I hold all three, 60% BTC and 40% divided in the other two, because I believe they will increase in their proportionality to BTC. LTC is .0095 a BTC but it could round out to more percentage points as the lightning network and atomic swaps come to consumer awareness. I speculate similarly worth ETH and the smart contacts capabilities.
