Don't get me wrong OP, no stranger to self-ridicule myself. As a kid, had long hair; shaved the top of my head once into a nice bold spot, greased my hair &amp; did a really convincing sleazebag comb-over.

Imagine a $1,000 bill that had nothing printed on it, and looked no different than a $0 bill, until you plugged it into an internet-connected computer? Still with me? K. Now imagine that $1,000 bill becoming $0 bill if you stuck it in your wallet &amp; sat on it. Or put it through a wash. Now imagine that $1,000 bill looking like a gutted thumbdrive. And costing $1,000 + whatever opendime costs to buy, and there you have it.
