I am an electrician so I have some knowledge regarding this. A 16A fuse with 2.5mm2 will do just fine for a couple of s9's. In the article he posted he claims just one of these beasts will make $1250/month, which seems unlikely at this point.

Btc needs to stop holding the altcoins down. Organic growth will be seen amongst many altcoins soon as they are driven by real world utility and actual usecase. Gonna be a good day to see the market respond correspondently. Usecase will be the drive of this market in the end.

Altcoins have much more potential gains. If btc decides to go on another run, what do you think will go up most in value, btc or an altcoin with a rock solid team and vision that they consistently progresses towards?

The bitcoin blockchain suffers a lot of issues such as lack of scalability, slow transaction times, high fees. We need lightning network to somehow fix that, but in btc's current state it is essentially useless when being used as a currency. Not to mention the total waste of electricity that could be easily solved by using the consesus algorithm instead. BTC will never be mass adopted, it is outdated tech.. Now the question remains; will it become the new standard for digitized gold and used as a store of value? It may, it may not, but I sure hope btc will thrive in value regardless.

How so? Is bitcoin scalable to thousands of transactions per second maybe? Or is it capable of instant settlement like a world wide adopted asset needs to offer? Don't think so tbh.
