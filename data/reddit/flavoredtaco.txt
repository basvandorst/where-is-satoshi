i agree with this
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:16:58
Thats awesome!
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:03:44
Do you have a link where i can get it?
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:31:07
what about credit union support instead of just banks? (like Localbitcoins)
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:56:23
That's good to hear. I believe that adding Credit Union support will definitely lead to a bigger user base

I am aware of this but you misunderstood my post. My first deposit cleared already (around $200) and got the email claiming i am free to withdraw that $200 now. But a few hours before that email, i went ahead and deposited another $100 which will be subject to 4 business days. 
This shouldnt leave me with $300 unable to withdraw. It should only be $100 unable to withdraw as i already got the email claiming i can withdraw the first deposit of $200.

So im confused. Is this a payment method (similar to Venmo) or can you buy/sell/trade Bitcoin with supported fiat?
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:03:26
How does that work, for example, with taxes?
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:19:40
I didn't know this already released
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:42:39
I have an old windows 8 laptop that i dont use. Is it possible i can make it run solely as a Linux machine vs booting Linux from a USB?
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:08:32
I am confused about this too. Also, will Abra users be able to sell BTC for their countries fiat?
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:53:06
Looking forward to this. Kinda reminds me of a service that got shut down last year i believe (can't remember the name)
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:39:44
Wow. I unfortunately was not aware of this.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:31:36

The fees were shown in the presentation video
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:57:51
whats the fees with Mycelium/Glidera?
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:39:57
He mentions hiding private keys in pictures. Can someone point me to where i can learn more about this? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:59:43
In my opinion, this run up to $1000 did not feel explosive at all but quite the opposite of a pump.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:27:47
Gotcha thanks. Is it even possible to override the laptops current OS with Tails OS? I know its possible with Ubuntu, but i thought Tails was only a usb bootable OS
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:37:33
2016 finishing strong
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:17:43
Try dollar cost averaging. Buy like $20-$50 every week no matter what the price

@_date: 2016-12-27 15:17:24
Very nice video.
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:42:34
Its a very good talk and worth watching imo
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:28:36
It will be fine. As long as its under the same Trezor device, it should have the same XPUB key which is essentially a list a of all your public addresses pertaining to that wallet/seed. Someone correct me if i am wrong
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:04:40
So, Vertcoin and Litecoin are going to have atomic swaps, does this mean we will be able to seamlessly cross between BTC, LTC, and VTC?
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:23:18
Awesome. Anyone know where i can learn how to program a price ticker?
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:32:23
Didn't even think of that. I can see that in the near future as well.
@_date: 2016-12-22 05:48:57
Nice!! Its pretty awesome seeing progress being made first-hand like this. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:33:28
Ah yes, don't let me off this ride
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:36:05
As someone who wants to look into investing in real estate, where would one even start?
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:49:51
Dang, $150 for the first issue of the magazine wow
@_date: 2016-12-28 03:30:12
Im actually interested in real estate as well. I just wish there was a way to divest into it with cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:37:01
Listen to this man
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:21:36
God bless you - thank you @_date: 2017-11-10 19:08:32
Buy more please
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:58:47
This is awesome! What's the benefit of running a node on a Rasberry Pi? I've been looking for an excuse to get one. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:30:08
Same ��
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:52:04
I lol'd
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:29:37
It'd be nice if they can come out with an iOS version already. Been waiting for years.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:27:43
Isn't there a way to make it so that if i am using lets say Electrum on my desktop, can't i point it directly to my node using Segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:34:53
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:58:46
Agreed. Everyone should follow him on Twitter if they aren't already.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:50:24
Will Bittrex allow immediate trading as well?
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:48:22
Why did you choose cryptocompare by the way?
