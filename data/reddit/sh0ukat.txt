You are  right...
Actually these bets are time based...so they cannot accept bets with confirmation... 
In this case, the bet was on price of a currency pair EURUSD...
The bet has to be instant... they cannot delay the bet until confirmation....
but you are very right that its a poorly implemented system, they just need to use the unconfirmed input in output payout and be safe...
they infact do use the same input after confirmation to send payout... so no idea why they wait for confirmation.. I will discuss it with them..

Several Stress tests have been done in the past month 
and a point is proven to the whole community... 
and everyone accepts it...
Any further stress testing is just vandalism to clog up the network for keks...

LoL trust me I have tried.. But the network just doesn't accept double spend transactions even after 5 seconds of original one...
all the nodes reject the double spent second transaction...

good guy f2pool.. the backlog is still at 29K transactions

That is a secure way for the operator but requires user to trust the operator and given the long list of bitcoin services that turned out to be scams, I myself don't want to trust anyone with my bitcoins.
The network propagation speed of transactions is pretty fast right now, takes around 2-3 seconds for a transaction to reach the operator given that they are well connected and It works for me as a user even if the bets are time sensitive.... given the benefit of peace of mind regarding my coins..

Thanks for your help.
Its already been a day and several hours since I broadcasted it...
It seems this Spam Attack has created a big backlog... hence I guess I ll have to wait more time... may be days

A bird in hand is better than two in the bush.
simple as that.
