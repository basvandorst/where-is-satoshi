Are you being serious or are you just actually that simple

Your username is "sovereign Curtis" and you're claiming you don't identify with being a "sovereign citizen" because blah blah big ol' meanie state. You're literally a walking, talking joke.
And about my name, yes I absolutely support the horrific and brutal murder of Snowden after he receives a trial in which he will obviously be found guilty. Sorry that I don't believe in picking and choosing laws to follow arbitrarily.
Also: lol, sovereign citizens.

So you are a big fan of credit card fraud via purse, I see?

You mean codified law democratically enacted as part of a binding social contract that guarantees peace, trade, and development? Woe is me being subdued by that mean ol' oppressive state!
side note: the best part about sovcitz twits like you is you seem to be wholly incapable of realizing how laughable you are

    &gt; implying you are tech-savvy because you think bitcoin is difficult to grasp

Not if you believe in the free market, there isn't. Why the fuck would anyone ever trade $100 in goods and services for $80? The only answer is to undercut the free market to try to drive people to use your service which is founded on a basis of fraud.
And butters wonder why everyone outside of bitcoin thinks bitcoin is a scam-infested piece of shit -- people like you comically deny this kind of shit no matter how blatant it is.

That is literally the only thing it is designed for. How else do you explain a "20% discount" on everything

You are citing "globalresearch.ca", actually? Are you a conspiratard or just flagrantly mentally ill?
@_date: 2015-03-22 23:23:31
So basically you plug your ears and pretend as if you aren't committing credit card fraud, lol.
It's hilarious that butters get all upset about chargebacks when it seems like a substantial portion of them are done *by the butters* in order to defraud legitimate businesses.

Are you an idiot or do you seriously not understand the difference between the Afghan Mujahadeen and the Arab Mujahadeen?
I ask because the CIA supplied the Afghan Mujahadeen (numbering around ~170,000 foot soldiers), the CIA did not supply the Arab Mujahadeen (numbering in the hundreds).
I know idiots like you like to assume "LOL BROWN PEOPLE R BROWN THEREFORE CIA", but maybe you ought to take the time to actually research &amp; read a few books before talking out of your ass.
@_date: 2015-03-04 04:45:28
Wrong, this is not correct at all. Literally nothing he posted was correct. Please see my other posts if you actually care to correct yourself.

Hey aren't you that idiot who is embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars?
@_date: 2015-03-04 04:40:36
You're a complete idiot; that's talking about a secular group called Harrakat Hazzm that the US was providing TOW missiles to, which was recently defeated in combat by JAN, Jabhat Al Nusra ("The Al Nusra Front") which is Al Qaeda in Syria.
**ISIS is not JAN, they are at war actually, you moron.** Take the time to visit before talking out of your ass.

lol no kidding
My favorite thing about butters is their belief that the internet will still be around should the financial apocalypse actually happen. That's gold, jerry, gold!
@_date: 2015-03-30 04:25:41
wow so brave lol
@_date: 2015-03-04 05:00:44
Do you even know who was in charge of the precursor to ISIS in 2007?
@_date: 2015-03-04 04:44:09


**This is complete bullshit, and makes it very apparent you don't even have a fleeting understanding of the war in Syria and Iraq**.


No, you fucking moron. Jabhat Al Nusra (JAN) was the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. The Islamic State of Iraq and Al Sham (ISIS) was the Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda.
Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, forcibly tried to merge JAN and ISIS without the Al Qaeda Central leadership (read: Zawahiri) approving, and it has provoked a war between the two. ISIS is no longer a part of Al Qaeda, JAN is. **ISIS and JAN are at war right now, you fucking idiot.**


Fuck you for being so clueless &amp; worse, trying to confuse other people with your (lack of) knowledge.
**To anyone who actually gives a shit about the facts:** I recommend you visit to learn more about the conflict. This fucking idiot literally got 100% of the 'facts' in his posts in this thread wrong.
