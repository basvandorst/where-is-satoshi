the really important part, is the question of if this is already done and over with... or if its just the start.
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:06:10
I put too many points into "wet blanket" and now I can't help myself.
@_date: 2019-07-22 09:49:36
thats a fair point.
"anything you want" is also a pretty broad, subjective thing too.  some people wouldn't hit that with a billion dollars in the bank,  others would be all set with 10 or 20 million or less even, depending on their personality and interests. 
I think if you draw the line at the family dynasty, multiple billions level, there are SO few people at that level, that it really skews the results.    I mean, if someone 2-4 generations ago earned wealth to the point that they could live comfortably on less than the interest/growth of their principle investment/capital/whatever, and they taught their offspring to manage it even modestly,  its not really surprising OR unreasonable that the family wealth would be at such a point now.   I don't think you need to get to that level before you count as rich. 
maybe I'm just overly modest, but if I were able to get to a point where I could comfortably retire early,  ensure a couple young people have a financially stable upbringing and pay for their college, I'd call that rich.   super-rich? maybe not.  but I don't think the bar has to be set THAT high.
@_date: 2019-07-22 09:27:02
from my understanding, theres actually quite a bit of turnover and that a LOT of people DO become rich, and a lot of rich people do not stay that way. 
I think it takes being in the hyper-rich (which there are very few of)  until you get the level of born into it and could never spend it all sort of thing. 
I do think there should be MORE financial mobility, but there is more than people like to think.
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:04:21
man if I had spent a few hundred bucks on BTC in 2010,  and sold it recently... I'd have enough money to figure out what I wanted to do with my time.    thats a problem I would be quite happy to have to figure out.
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:29:26
I think the biggest part of the boom might be.   but I can also imagine a future where theres still a bit more left.  
TBH I'm torn on which future I think is more likely.  I can envision paths that go in both directions that are both plausible.    I don't see enough evidence to really convince me one direction or the other.

my main purchase having started was just a little under 13k.   I was hoping the overnight bottom was gonna be it,  and it wasn't gonna put me at a paper loss.  
I started with an approach that it PROBABLY wouldn't go down MUCH for very long.  and I still feel pretty stable about that.  but I can only imagine the nerves for people who bought in higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:46:22
I was actually thinking about that too,  seems to me that a sheet of brass would probably be pretty reasonable for that.  
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:57:50
to be fair, I'm pretty sure lots of formerly rich people are such, because they did the same thing, and just happened to be wrong. 
and I'm sure there are "self made rich people" whos gambles were not obvious even in hindsight, and just happened to turn out spectacularly well.
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:15:31
I think that's easy to say, but not as easy to follow through on.
Also, not entirely accurate.  I mean, yeah, they do decide what's illegal or not.  That's how the system works.
"Taxation is theft" absolutism is silly fanaticism, IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:23:46
Or maybe it's more the equivalent of the cashiers having to take lunch even if there is a line out the door.
Or closing for an hour to fix a problem with the registers or vault.
I get that conspiracies are fun and all, but don't forget to trim some fat with occams razor.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:35:34
So what about all the shit work nobody in their right mind would do for free, but that can't be yet automated?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:40
so you aren't a Disciple of Aubrey De Grey I take it... maybe he'll be even half right and some people here might see that age. 
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:28:05


I don't see how this is anything but a hollow platitude.


I'm not disagreeing with your right to have your opinion.
I'm not addressing my agreement or lack thereof with the system.  
I'm just saying that declaring something contrary to present reality is strange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:18
I'm in a similar boat.   I'm kinda torn between being excited and nervous.   if it does go down between now and then, I'm planning to just sit on it til it goes back up, as I don't get the impression that its likely to stay below around that indefinitely,  and it should come back to at least break even eventually. 
but if its still really high when the check clears, I might split a big chunk of what I have into BTH or something to diversify it.  I'm at an awkward spot where if the amount I put in is locked up for a year+, it would be possibly inconvenient, but not the end of the world... completely gone would be really frustrating, but if the people who think this is just the start of the moonshot are more than like, a quarter correct, it could be massively life changing.  
seems like a pretty distinctly convex risk curve, at least in my case. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:56
by hiring an accountant to figure that out?  at least thats what I'd do. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:47
I wish I'd put the wear on my hardware back in the day to mine while sleeping and whatnot though.  ffs.   this is nuts. 
Coinbase seeming to have gone completely down is just adding to the anxiety. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 06:37:23
It's great here.
We definitely have the better deal.
What do you think you have in places like that which we don't have here?
@_date: 2018-05-15 05:55:14
Why would it not be legal?  Why would it be your business at all?
@_date: 2018-05-08 05:56:19
Wow, I can't imagine living someplace like that.
Here you can get a reasonably nice 2 story plus basement 3 bed house for like 150k.
Quarter million gets you nearly whatever you could want.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:18:49
why would you use a bank that charges you a monthly fee unless they are VERY MUCH making it worth your while?
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:40:34


What makes you think that's what I'm doing?
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:17:00
how is that a flaw in the system?  you chose to do that....
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:25:48
People say a lot of things.  That doesn't make it a good idea.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:30:54
Why would you get to force others to do things like not charge you for a service they provide you, just because that is popular?
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:43:33


That's projection.
Do you support all the pain in the as s KYC regulations?
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:46:11
You don't see any parallels between dictating ATM fees and dictating KYC procedures?
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:35:43
so?  why is that worth the government intrusion?   apparently plenty of people are fine paying the fee for the convenience. 
I see almost no reason for anyone to pay that fee that isn't their own fault or something they could relatively easily avoid if they could be bothered.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:25:37
I put into bitcoin only that which I could afford to have tied up for a while.
I do think that it's likely bit coin will be back up past previous peaks.
But I'm not particularly confident on it being this year.
At the current rate, I'm expecting that by time it does make it back up to what I put in plus inflation.... It'll probably feel like finding money in an old pair of pants.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:17:37
why should they though?
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:07:54


Maybe I'm just too broke for them to bother making themselves appealing too, or in just not inclined to care about those things.
I don't pay any fee for my banking, and I don't have much use for anything that I can think of being different that would be worth paying for like that.  My needs from a bank are very simple.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:17:40
See in that sort of situation, it totally makes sense.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:49:56
Ffs people are being asinine today.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:01:47
Any Bitcoin ATMs near you?  I think I remember a site where you connect with local people to trade person to person or something.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:19:15
yeah, the ATM listings I saw near me ... encouraged me to be patient with Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-12-12 11:37:21
The principle behind this is why they are justified in not taking bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:56:02
I think this sounds intuitively likely.
Question is how high is it going to go before crashing back down for a while.
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:35:40
buy a miner with it?
@_date: 2018-11-24 05:48:34
Honestly if it does to that low I would probably buy more.  
I'm not deep into crypto at all, so like just $100 put in at 2k would lower my break even by enough to probably be worthwhile.
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:32:26
Newegg at least used to.  Been a long time since I looked
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:48:43
Is it really such a minority of people who really took "only invest what you can afford to lose" to heart?
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:05:35
there is nothing wrong with wearing things of quality and value appropriate to your wealth. 
I think in some ways it'd be sorta disingenuous for someone like them to run around in some walmart budget clothes.  IMO thats almost MORE disrespectful to "normal people" than wearing high end versions of "normal people" clothes. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:05:47
Yeah I don't even pretend to know.
Strangely enough I actually listened to the advice not to invest more than I could afford to lose, so even if it all permanently went to shit, I'd be mad, but it wouldn't break my finances.
I've halfway written it off, so if it's tied up for a couple of years is it aught to just feel like found money by then.
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:59:15
I wonder if I can make up fancy sounding nonsense and get people to send me money for the insight....
@_date: 2018-11-01 05:06:29
If you aren't in the states, does your local government not have something like FDIC?
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:36:29
I'd be pretty tempted to hedge my bets and go with A and C. 
the idea being that if things go well in that time,  either Bitcoin is dead, and everything is great anyway, or bitcoin is alive and highly valuable.  
or if things go badly, a tarp, gun or phone would be to minimally worthwhile, but a proper metal tool like a hatchet could be key in both survival and that survival having a good quality of life.  
I mean, you can mostly do the things a tarp would do in other ways.  
a gun wouldn't be that great for hunting, and if you needed it for defense against other people/zombies or something,  you likely wouldn't have enough ammo and would die anyway.   phone would run out of charge and be useless.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:14:07
It seems like there should be a "and to a sickle everything looks like a...." addendum to that.

you say that like you think in real life world scale terms BTC's market share is chump change or something.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:04:50
if you are using ATM's with fees on a regular basis, you pretty much by definition suck at managing your money. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:46:11
Why would you not be able to?  That's weird.  
Requiring both of you sign I could see, maybe.  But such a weird reaction.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:59:42
This is exactly what I was thinking.   Damn I wish I had enough money to be that careless.
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:52:14
Is a large price markup plus a sizable fee somehow going to encourage people to use these machines?
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:51:30


Yeah but unless internet and power is relatively stable and monolithic, the value in those wallets are basically non-transferable.
I mean you could make a bunch of paper wallets that have  .01 BTC or something, and trade them like cash, trusting that the person who made it didn't keep the numbers, or lie about loading it.
@_date: 2019-05-06 10:10:36
I mean, that is generally totally preventable with some foresight and planning.... but well... I guess that is a problem some people have.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:00:59
I was thinking the same,  kinda funny to not use a plant with a clear and distinctive taproot for that.

Hey if you can remember it next time you incarnate(reincarnation I mean)  then the next you might be rich as hell.
