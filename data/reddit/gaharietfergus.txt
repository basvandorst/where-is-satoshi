This is one of the most WTF things I have ever seen.

But Silicon Valley is available through bittorrent, so it's plenty cool enough for you. It's practically on the darknet blockchain webz!

I agree. This source is suspicious.

What is to stop Trezor from creating a firmware update that steals all our bitcoins before they disappear into the night?
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:28:50
Do we have any way of verifying what's in a firmware update before we install it? What stops trezor from making a firmware update that steals all our bitcoins before they disappear into the night?

The Wall Street pump has begun.

You seem kind of upset about this.

Here's the tweet: 
It is a reference to when Louis and Billy Ray waited to start buying back their futures in the plummeting market in frozen concentrated orange juice. I think what Silbert is saying with that tweet is that the price is being manipulated down by the Wall Street types who want to buy in cheap. They are now waiting for the moment to buy. The implication is that the price is about to turn around. Who knows whether it is true?

This is the most sensible comment here and it has been downvoted relentlessly. If I wasn't sure about the existence of paid bitcoin trolls when I made the original post, I'm pretty sure now.
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:07:06
That's ridiculous. Both Silbert and the Winkevoss twins are still way in the black in their bitcoin investments.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:46:31
Ooh. More vitriol. Keep it coming, trolls.

The smart money has bought in. Now it's time to create a mania.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:12:39
I love fallout and bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-27 11:22:12
Yeah. Because everyone who is sentenced to prison by oligarchs is a worthless person.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:10:02
Yeah. And you're not a paid troll or anything.

I think ToTheMoonGuy is Satoshi.

Hard to pump and dump without your Twitter account. And it's Bryce, by the way.

No Winklevii?
