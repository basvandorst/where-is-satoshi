All time low?  It was lower than this a little over a month ago.

This is why I think myriad coin has a lot of potential.  It uses multi-PoW with different algorithms.  To 51% it, you would have to control 3/5 separate PoWs. (sha256/scrypt/goestl/qubit/skein)  If one of the chains forks, the other 4 aren't effected. Soon, it will even go a step beyond this by adding p2p pools directly into the client so that it's the ideal way to mine it.

One of the upcoming releases for Myriad is supposed to have gpu mining and p2p pooling built directly in the client.  I do see what you're saying about 1 pool having all 5 chains and everyone migrating to it, but it should be much less likely to occur, especially with p2p pooling built directly into the client.

I still think Myriad coin has the best PoW solution.  It's essentially 5 block chains working together.  Sha256/scrypt/skein/groestl/qubit.  If one of the chains gets 51% attacked or forked, the coin as a whole is unaffected.  To truly 51% myriad, you would need control of 3/5 of the chains.  Soon, they're even going a step farther by implemented mining and a p2p pool directly in the client so that it's the ideal way to mine it, along with a way for other coins to merge mine into myriad without destroying the coin. 
I think as a whole myriad has the potential to be much more secure then bitcoin is.

Me too, all the way back in june 2013.  I remember people last year saying cryptsy was shady and mintpal was the way to go....

This.  Bitcoin is so slow to use on most sites, it's dinosaur money.  I never use bitcoin if I have the option to use an alt.  People talk shit about alts but coins like Bitshares make bitcoin look very outdated.

I was going to try it until this.  No way.

Litecoin and other altcoins have gotten many people into crypto/bitcoin that would have never done so otherwise.  Many of the bitcoiners here are too oblivious to see that.  I personally know several people that got into crypto because of Litecoin.

They're still trading litecoin and altcoins.  Literally millions of dollars go through altcoins a day.

Yes bitcoin is much safer then altcoins.  You only lose 75%+ of your investment with bitcoin.  
I'm not trying to attack bitcoin but you guys attacking altcoins are hilarious.  You guys kicking Litecoin when it's down remind me of everyone who talked shit about bitcoin in 2011 when it dropped from $30 to $1.

DGW is just a patched version of KGW.   The OP's point stands as no altcoin has had an innovation as heavily adopted.  Next closest is probably PPC and PoS.  If megacoin was purely a scam, it sure did it right.

the nov 2013 was not just gox.  Infact I'd argue Nov 2013 is what screwed gox, didn't anticipate china.  Price went too high for gox's issues. 
Everyone who was around during the bubble paying attention knew china had a major impact.  BTC china led most of the rallys, not gox.  Most people were calling gox insolvent LONG before the bubble, the bubble just made it so they couldn't  lie anymore.

Most all alts are traded for bitcoin.  Which means everyone into alts is by proxy into bitcoin.  Altcoins are an extension of Bitcoin and they exist because of Bitcoins success.  This also means they drop like a rock when bitcoin looks like shit.  I said this before and I'll say it again, altcoins are good for bitcoin adoption.

People give willy too much credit.  Willy no doubt had an effect but anyone who was in the bubble paying attention knows china played a HUGE role in driving the price.
Infact I'd say china might have screwed him and his plans.

Is there any reason not to have it?

IIRC gox started taking a huge shit around $30 going offline constantly. You could say gox was the end of every major bubble.

Coinbase exchange doesn't operate in almost half of US states.  Gemini is supposed to be open to all states when it launches. Not revolutionary, but opens doors.

I know you're a buttcoin troll, but this is a horrible comparison.  You could at least try.

Not really a cult, more like fan boys.  These type of people exist on just about everything popular that has a user base.  They pretty much have the same attitude regardless of what they're passionate about.

There used to be xbox/sony fanboys (probably still is, been awhile since I paid attention)  who would get excited some game was an exclusive to their console, not because they wanted to play it, but just because it made their system "better" than the other.   
I agree with you that some in the bitcoin community are like that, (ok, a lot) but those people aren't the only people in the bitcoin community.  r/bitcoin just happens to be one of the most popular places for bitcoin, so you run into those people very often.    The same attitude can be found in some altcoin forums too, but anti-bitcoin instead. 
A lot of subreddits are circle jerks, it's not specific to r/bitcoin.
