Haha, I heard Bcash uses wall hacks and won't even 1v1 me.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:36:59
Haha, fair enough. I definitely misread that with a heavier dose of snark than intended. Have a good one, friend.

Wish I could upvote this about a billion times. Who the hell cares? It puts all this unnecessary focus on drama. "Us" vs "Them." Reeks of US media political coverage.

Much like a cricket in the night you won't stop it chirping. You will, however, look and sound a fool swinging a shoe in the dark hoping to stop "the pest" in a blatantly anti pest sub reddit.

I didn't disparage anyone's opinion or try to create some sort of ideological lynch mob. I'm advocating for a step away from needless combative comparisons. Unless you're really pro senseless drama, I don't see where I created a divide.

The use of "other side" sort of supports my point. I understand the need to shed light on ingorance, however this is a rather insulated pro bitcoin community. Many things posted here are closer to grandstanding than constructive discourse.

Everytime this is posted one of you edgelords says this, every time.
Thanks for not letting me down!
@_date: 2018-09-20 17:36:13
this is the worst thing ive seen on this sub. Impressive.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:01:48
My point is you are wall papering that opinion everywhere, which means you have some sort of motive.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:02:33
Lol you really want to get this opinion out there eh buddy?
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:03:10
Feel free to do as you please. I'm surprised by your honesty/self-awareness given the nature of some of your posts. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:25:45
Oh that is because it was not a compliment. Strictly an observation. I leave the opinions to you and the other vocal locals. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:55:47
I appreciate you.
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:29:46
Stop posting this garbage
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:58:35
haha werent you one of those suckers that is down big? Sorry youre still blue, pal!
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:24:36
Some TA would agree with you. However my personal analysis says it could be 2025 by the end of 2018!  
Do your own research though!!
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:13:27
Youre saying we will hit somewhere between $1K and $100K  in the next 4 years? 
Solid analysis. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:06:50
yeah possibly for sure. solid analysis. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:56:18
Oh wow solid analysis. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:40:33
Definitely, good call. No one can dispute this.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:13:10
haha so funny to see the moonbois come back out so quickly. Just enjoy the ride and don't get greedy. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 00:24:42
Yes then when it falls to 3k again we can take it super seriously.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:27:41
I love bitcoin too but this is a little silly. Bitcoin is definitely volatile right now. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:00:37
haha but they italicized the "long" part. How can you doubt them?
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:24:59
I mean, I can't be sure. By my own logic. I think.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:30:52
