Is the logo in the thumbnail supposed to look like the top of a balding man's head? Because that's what I can see.

Cory Doctorow did not release his book for free. That it is available via torrent is testament to my point: people will steal your things no matter how beloved you are or what you do to discourage them. Regardless of your opinion on so-called digital 'piracy,' it is currently illegal in every jurisdiction that I am aware of.

What do I care? I'll just sell it for half the price you do. Even if everyone knows that everything I publish is plagiarized, I'll still make money because people are cheap.

The comment I replied to seems to be advocating for no copyright laws whatsoever. Personally, something between 5 and 20 years would be good, with 10 (IMO) being just about right: enough time to make a respectable income from your work but no so long that you'd be tempted to just rest on your laurels after one success.

So if you write a book, I should be able to scratch your name out and write my own in and sell it?

I'm stealing your work, I don't care about authorship or my reputation. Since I did zero work, I can redistribute it at a fraction of the cost and make money. There will always be a buyer because my stolen work is cheaper than your original work.

Generally speaking, the prices are still set in fiat currency. A calculation is made to determine the correct amount of bitcoins to charge. The accuracy of this conversion depends on how frequently a retailer updates their bitcoin pricing. So, if a retailer has a system that updates near real-time, yes, your coffee will cost a different amount of BTC this afternoon (assuming a shift in the price of BTC) .

If someone writes a book and self-publishes it digitally, they will set a price that they feel pays them a fair wage for their work (based on selling a number of copies). Even if that price is low (a dollar for argument's sake), I can steal it, do basically zero work to 'rebrand' it and sell it for $0.50, or $0.10, or any non-zero amount and make money.
I agree that the current state of copyright law is ridiculous but I don't believe that getting rid of copyright altogether is the answer either. A short copyright of 5-10 years (possibly adjusted for media type since some things have a longer shelf life than others) would allow for decent earnings from creative work but not allow anyone to just collect royalties after one big break.
Related: I think the patent system should have a similarly shortened time frame, and while I'm making a wishlist, the patent system should have a built in licensing system where the costs are determined up-front (possibly by a third party but probably not by the originator), before the patent is issued, and a license to use a patent cannot be refused to limit/prevent competition, and I'd like a pony.
