Does this mean that payments will be sent from shared addresses e.g. instawallet style, so it is no longer compatible with SatoshiDICE?

Bitcoin-Qt never reuses addresses. So if I spent a 700 BTC output today the change would be returned to a new address, the new address according to this article would be considered not in circulation (i.e. it is never sent a transaction) even though it was spent  today. The statistics from this article are complete rubbish.

If your using blockchain.info the easiest way to play is click "Send Money" then under games "Satoshi Dice". Just choose the odds you want (i.e. 50% means 50% chance of winning) and put in the amount to bet.
It is pure luck. The outcome of each bet is determined base on your transaction hash and a secret SatoshiDICE generates. It is uncheatable (i.e. you always get a fair roll) as long as somebody is checking the secrets.
