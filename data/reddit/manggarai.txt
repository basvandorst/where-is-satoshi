This can be huge is it catches on. If one of these startups can put bitcoin tech into the hands of the 80% unbanked, that would be massive step forward for the country and bitcoin itself. We're looking at millions of transactions a day at the local markets where most of the vendors almost never go to the bank. They rely completely on the day's cash flow to purchase tomorrow's goods.
Most people are still unable to afford a smart phone and a lot of the population is skeptical of internet security. That's why internet adoption has been so slow here. However, similar to Kenya, many people buy and sell "pulsa" which is credit for your hand phone. They are all very adept at managing their phone credit on dumbphones. I seriously hope one of these start ups helps make btc available to the mass majority here. I'm so excited about this now!

20 million in usd? You'd sell your coins to become part of the failed economy? 
I get what you mean, but why sell? Let those fuckers burn.

In case you want to sell digital goods? Or pay for something in "advanced" before the good are sent? I can go on.

If for some miracle reason, people decide to buy into Bitcoin in droves, governments will do everything in their power to destroy the exchanges that make it possible. We won't see another massive rally like we did until a platform that allows people to exchange their fiat emerges that is impervious to closure.

What is he wearing?

Is it worst that he fucked everyone and spent the money on whores, or that he's still bitcoin's ceo?
