Once again Ethereum would be more comparable as it is something upon which a myriad of DAPPS can be built upon. Bitcoin is an example of one kind of DAPP so rather than comparing it to an overall protocol around which things could be built - I would compare it more to an early first mover tech (ie 56K modem), for example.

TCP/IP is a protocol. I can see parallels to something like Ethereum but how are you comparing it to bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:25:35
Not an accident at all. It was the first mover. But technology is always moving forward. Thats why you dont see VHS or 56K modems around that much anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:17:17
It works on a protocol. It's not a protocol in and of itself.

Big dicks in wall street want the price as low as possible so they can buy in. Noobs are of course gobbling up all the propaganda and selling off at a loss. See you guys in a few weeks with all the "why the fuck did i sell?" posts.

I think alot of people dump almost every cent they have into crypto so they get really antsy during large dips and rises. And end up making completely boneheaded decisions due to pressure.Overinvestment is a bitch. 
Dump only the amount you would be completely okay with losing and hodl that shit for at least a couple years. That's the secret to gains.

Most people are clueless, compulsive as hell and have no business investing. Especially in something as volatile as crypto markets. They might as well go try their luck at the blackjack tables in Vegas. For them it would be about the same odds of making a profit.

Okay buddy ;)

Buy fear, sell greed. One of the most useful quotes of all time.

Lol 
Investing in crypto is essentially gambling. You don't gamble when youre already 38K in debt my friend.start saving money. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:21:13
Well it's a better time to buy now than a few weeks ago that's for sure.
Invest however much you are willing to lose and just consider that money as a sunk cost. Don't get too emotionally invested in your investment. It will drive you mental on every dip.

Bought at 18.5K and bought a little more just now at 13.8 
Happy hodling :)
I foresee a torrent of "why the fuuuck did i sell?" posts next week when it hits over 20K again. Don't make noob mistakes, people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:43:47
Lol for fuck sake people. This is crypto. Was this anything but a huge rollercoaster at any point in time? Don't over invest to the point where you are contemplating suicide on every dip. It's not healthy. Chill out. Get some sleep. It will be okay. It's another correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:38:50
Invest however much youre comfortable with losing. Lock it away in cold storage and check back in a year. And don't listen to all the hype and hysteria during each rise and dip. It will drive you insane. That is honestly the advice I follow and the best one you will get. 
Getting caught up in the whole day trading thing and trying to time the market and all that shit is for people with lots of spare money to lose. It's a surefire way to get eaten up if you're a newbie. 
Crypto is like a stock market on major steroids. Making any reasonable predictions is ultimately futile.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:54:12
I would just buy in gradually on every dip.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:25:27
If your sole way of putting food on the table for your family is investing in a highly volatile crypto market full of speculation you're doing it  wrong.
Mind as well go to Vegas and put your life savings on black. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:35:45
I don't know if this is your first time at the rodeo but Bitcoin goes through growths and dips almost constantly.  Welcome to crypto. Wait it out and it will bounce above 20K soon.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:31:04
Second chance to buy relatively low for those who snoozed up until now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:57:20
Eh it's highly centralized with potentially unlimited supply. Will probably depreciate.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:12:28
Investing with spare change is fine. I'm talking about people who are dangerously over invested. It's like a gambling addiction to them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:38:49
Best time relative to what? If you plan to hold it for like 1-5 years then yeah probably. If Bitcoin is still around you'll probably make a profit.
 If you want to day trade you will probably get stripped anyway since most people start behaving very irrationally during rollercoasters like this.
Just don't be an idiot who takes out a 2nd mortgage and first newborn's soul and  waits to buy it when the bullrun is in full effect (cause hype) and then panic sells during the following dip.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:59:58
You mean you don't like paying $30 transaction fees for $3.50 cup of coffee?
Don't be so stingy, brah. It's the future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:20:00
It's a cycle. Media hype train. Normies buying at ATH. Inevitable dip. Panic sell. "bitcoin is trash"
People need to stop treating bitcoin (and crypto in general) as a get rich overnight scheme and more like the long term tech revolution that it actually is. Hop off the hype train and research, people. You will be wiser for it. If you want to gamble  go to Vegas.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:03:43
First of all no one should have all of their life savings in crypto or Bitcoin alone for that matter. That's just fucking dumb. If you only invest based on hype and hysteria you will get ass pummeled by the end. Research and make reasonable decisions.
The inherent value of Bitcoin is that it is supposed to be decentralized, anonymous currency system. Not controlled by governments or banking institutions. And the backbone of the crypto market in general which has some revolutionary technologies emerging.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:45:47
So youre telling me you hodld strong through all the BTC crashes and corrections (sometimes for almost a year on end) for the past 8 years and just now decided to cash out because of a less than a week long mediocre dip?
Get the fuck outta here. If you bought BTC at $30 in 2011 you would've sold it when it dipped to $28 lol
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:37:20
who fucking knows
Is it too late to put in $10 and have it turn into a $1 million in 5 years? Probably. Is it too late to double, quadruple or quintuple your investment? Probably not.
Nobody knows how far this thins is going to go. A few weeks ago people were predicting that it will jump to $17000 by mid next year. Well it's already at $17000.
Is it a bubble? Is it going to plummet at any moment? Will it keep growing ad infinitum? Nobody fucking knows. There is no real historical precedent to what bitcoin is and how it will affect the world.
Just put in your couple hundred bucks and let it ride. Check back in a year or so. Worst case scenario you will lose a couple hundred bucks. Best case scenario - ?
