I think he did change his passes by the dropbox incident, although I think he probably had some other means compromised (skype, or email) that lead to dropbox and loss of last 2btc. 
Thanks again for the time taken to read our report. Hopefully we can spread more awareness through more reports like these.

I reported this issue, and others, to MtGox a month ago. The responses were slow, and mostly unresponsive. I'm glad they got this fixed but they're lax with security issues.

I noticed that too... true.io is relatively new but I think its because the site is a one page javascript.. not sure how google is handling javascript that sucks :\ we were on frontpage of slashdot today which was nice. thanks for pointing out! I'll try to fix that

I'm glad this is getting more awareness.
I wrote a report on this last week:
The same guys have been running this phishing campaign for a few weeks already and got themselves a nice chunk of BTC unfortunately.
I've been shutting down theirs servers one by one since the end of October. Shoutouts to Apexy and BitVPS for shutting down the first few servers. reg.ru however seems to be ignoring abuse complaints.
They are also running an active Coinbase scam off of bit-sec.org unless they removed it. I kept reporting the arbitrary coinbase apps to coinbase and they were quick to eliminate them!

I will look them over and get back to you via email. Hopefully we can figure this out.
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:33:37
They should!

I will get a text version up. True.IO is a JS heavy platform.

Great post.
I wrote about the Coinbase OAuth app phishing here: 
I'm really excited to see the community exploring these issues and spreading the awareness. We have to work on these threats together and hopefully save countless BTC from being stolen.
Kudos to Coinbase and Blockchain for working with me directly and taking in my lengthy reports. Shutting down the attackers as I reported them.
@_date: 2014-11-28 01:18:57
I'm glad these kind of posts and awareness is getting some attention. It is urgently needed.
We have been doing reports on Bitcoin security issues lately, after spending the last year auditing exchanges and informing them of vulnerabilities.
RE: Blockchain.info and Coinbase.com phishing networks - I have been tracking a group of Russian guys stealing a decent amount of Bitcoins over the course of the last 2 months and they're spreading and getting more and more.
It is time that we as a community take these threats serious, and educate our peers who are falling for them.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:06:54
I am claiming they have a communications problem with security researchers. They fixed the issues I reported a month after I reported them. That window frame is too big to be honest. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:58:40
From a security researchers perspective this scene is a bit interesting. Some questions and thoughts:
1) Did you use the machine for anything other than Bitcoin? and if so - what?
2) Have you recently installed any new software? Maybe a new Bitcoin client, or app?
3) If the machine has no external IP and is NATing one port in which is your bitcoin client - can you check your configuration and see if you have some easy rpcuser/rpcpassword combination?
4) Besides bitcoin client - do you have any other services running on the machine? SSH?
Look at the transfer of coins and take note of the time frame of the heist. Then go through your logs in /var/logs for any suspicious activity around this time. I'm talking about auth.log, syslog, apache logs if you're running it.
Take a look at 'last' command and note any logins that completely stand out to you.
cat /etc/passwd and look for any new users. Or users with /bin/bash all of a sudden added as its shell when it's not supposed to.
cat /etc/shadow and note any accounts with new passwords that have a password hash when they really shouldn't.
Go through every home directory you have and look for evidence of history files (cat /root/.bash_history /home/youruser/.bash_history) look for any obvious commands you yourself did not execute.
ps auxwww - look for any suspicious processes you know shouldn't be running. and apt-get install lsof to look for any running services/open ports that don't need to be open.
Technically there is much to do regarding post-heist forensic work. Consider your entire machine compromised for the time being. If you need help with any of this, or have questions simply message me.

In our report from a few weeks ago:  we discussed how the phishers were automating the complete disabling of:
- 2FA
- Notifications
- Downloaded unencrypted private keys
It would require you to log into blockchain.info using the phisher site. Once you log in, it'll forward your login to their backend guid/password stealers (acc.php, or similar). Then, while you're logged in and before you're redirected back to the phishing site it will disable many security features automatically as it had your password from your initial login.
I think setting a very strong secondary password will help. However, it would also be phished in the same process eventually as the phishers evolve.
Another problem is that even if you were to have a secondary password on the account, and you managed to avoid entering your second password - the attacker at this point has your encrypted keys. They can use a tool to crack it later on.
Obviously another attack vector IS backups. Attackers are literally going through every potential vector where you may store your backups:
- emails
- dropbox
- etc
They gain your email address from the automated script that disables your security features. They tie your email on your blockchain.info account to the password you provided during the initial phishing campaign.
And finally, to add insult to injury once you are compromised once it is over for that account and its addresses. The attackers, as I said before, downloading your unencrypted private keys. They would create another BlockChain account and simply import your keys and wait for you to receive payments.
Once your account is compromised its best to move on from that account.

Contact me at bitcomsecresearch 
I am actually interested in helping you figure out this attack vector, if possible. Would be cool to track this backwards.
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:20:03
I figure combining both my interests would be an amazing and powerful idea for both myself, but also the communities involved.
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:50:56
Nope, not the exchange in question. 
I messaged CoinEX admins to see if they'd like me to help them with post-hack forensics. Waiting on a response.
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:23:44
Yeah I wouldn't risk posting public dox unless they're entirely verified and confirmed. Plus posting dox on reddit always has been an issue.
I'm going to start looking at this and see if I can find any more info on these guys. Keep your head up.
@_date: 2014-11-20 06:31:31
Thanks for the gold! Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:46:10
On the contrary gents, those are rewards I gained from helping exchanges, that you probably use, secure their servers.
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:44:05
Hi, I am se[c] in that thread. As some of you may know I've been doing security research for exchanges and bitcoin related sites for some time now. Most of the work I do is in the background, some work I tweet, but mainly helping exchanges with security issues.
In this case, I found logs of the attacker during a post-forensic audit and traced it back to his user account on the exchange where the coins were stolen from.
I ended up completely doxing him, finding him and even contacting him directly to return the stolen BTC. However it seems he has grouped up with a bunch of other Russians on the forums to turn it around on me and say that I'm trying to extort him instead.
In all reality - this is a messed up situation because the people in charge of the exchange are actually nice guys. They were able to recover from the hack and it has not affected its users whatsoever. So that is nice at least.
To conclude: the guy and his friends are essentially douches, and will go and party with stolen Bitcoins. All logs, dox and communications have been forwarded to the proper authorities and thats the end of that.
And if you think I'm a scammer I suggest you look at my reddit trophy wall and see that in fact I've provided security research to Reddit itself.
P.S. If you are an exchange, or commerce site that are in need of security services by all means message me.
@_date: 2014-10-23 04:56:16
Thanks for the read. We put a lot of effort into it and appreciate the responses.
He got away with it for so long simply because no one paid attention to him. Instead of investigating the hacks people were more interested in focusing on the loss of coins, rather than where the coins went to.
I'm glad to finally reach an end to this chapter regarding CryptoRush.in, but unfortunately the guy is still actively stealing Bitcoins. His most recent hack occurred less than a month ago when he pilfered Midascoin/Midaspool.com for another 15 Bitcoins effectively killing the small project.
Pass this information on, hopefully we can stop people like these.

I once helped out an exchange owner who got hacked and lost all user Bitcoins. He got pretty much the same response from his users- everyone thinking he stole it all.
I did an independent review of the hack and executed as thorough a post-hack forensics on live systems as one can do. I felt bad for the guy as well. But once the evidence all presented itself I was able to see the big picture - things happen and it sucks.
Not sure what MagicalTux's story is mainly because I haven't seen the evidence, but I'm sure there are other researchers like me or investigators involved in looking for the lost coins.
You can read my report here in case you want an interesting read: 
Just give it time - hopefully it'll all get explained and put out there. You don't want to push the guy to kill himself, and most of the story dies away with him.
@_date: 2014-09-12 04:26:04
I'm a security researcher for the Bitcoin Community Security (bitcomsec) project and I'll definitely help out by auditing your sources, and site if you ever do decide to re-launch it.
But that mediafire link isn't working. Care to post the sources somewhere I can grab directly? PM url. And I'll take a look for you.
Take care and keep your head up.
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:47:30
On the contrary, I found his IP in logs. IP was used in the attack. The attacker logged into his user account on the exchange. I googled his username and found him all over Bitcoin forums discussing mining and security issues.
Yeah, that doesn't sound like I broke any laws. Thanks for defending him though. When he has the authorities at his door I hope you're there to defend him then.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:48:56
I think this is great. Good work there buddy. All the data in there may give you some insights into blockchain attacks and spams, which you can put together signatures for and detect them en masse almost in real time.
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:11:16
Hey sorry for your loss! Over at BITCOMSEC we've been tracking these guys and shutting down their servers. It's been one hell of a experience catching up with all of their domains/servers.
We put up a report at: 
They're targeting coinbase.com users through authorized apps, and blockchain.info through common phishing methods. One thing I will say for sure is:
1) Coinbase.com has been very quick to respond everytime I email them new phishing apps
2) Blockchain.info has been quick to shut down the operations as well by simply using cloudflare to ban the phishing domain IPs
3) These guys are scum.
If you can pm me the phishing page link, or email headers that'd help me in my investigation and track down their current operations.
Again, sorry for your loss man.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:11:56
I wouldn't say its contradictory, but I can see your point in using a JS platform to publish our reports considering JS is a constant vector for client-side attacks.
In all reality I like true.io, and we're kind of testing the platform out for the people who have put so much work into it. As one of our researchers is also a developer for the platform behind true.io we decided to help test it.
Thanks for the read!

Absolutely! At the end of the day in "real life" besides working as a security researcher I've been a mentor, a teacher etc. So welcome, and enjoy. Hopefully we get some good discussions going!
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:23:38
Awesome! That is my mentality right now too - whats cooler than combining netsec+bitcoins. Especially with all these security incidents going on the last couple years. Truth be told I got involved with bitcoins a couple years ago, but my life was more focused on my career than to combine both ideas. Now seems the right time albeit a bit late. Thanks for your interest and participation!
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:04:25
I agree. It's funny, I wanted to post some articles about similar topics but in my mind I said - would this pertain to the security of Bitcoin? Yes, and no. Yes, because it is a security issue that affects users, the protocol itself. No, because its not infosec related. I guess security in some aspects is relative!
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:04:56
thanks! I'm glad people are finding this idea useful!
