Hi Sovereign, I am not here to send anyone away from anything.
Change is happening and people are voting with their $'s. You may be declaring publicly what many are doing privately. Pragmatism and risk mitigation in the face of known events and potential unknown consequences means(people like me) need to take pro-active measures to guarantee the net-worth we have. Buying is a rational response.What we buy, hold and use is a personal choice. 
Censorship may remove dissenting voices but it will not negate the value and impact of their financial choices. You have made a choice and I am glad there was an option for you to choose from.

Iridium, Platinum, Helium 3, Gold, Water, I think the thing we need to do is to be creating and sending out Satellites and  Bots to look. Survey the likely orbits and  look far enough out to see something worth chasing and catching. There are companies actively building the mining equipment for space here on earth now. I would love to see an ICO for a launch to survey a Platinum asteroid and then raise the money to mine it..and smelt it on orbit in a solar refractory. Dreams a mans got to have them

A very reassuring statement. I have however removed your product from my device and will not be reinstalling it until there is new release which has been checked for issues.
