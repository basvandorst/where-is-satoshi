My ability to pull money out of an ATM is unimpeded if my card is in working order and is able to use the network the machine belongs to. It won't matter if I am with bank X and use bank Y's machine because it will simply work.
If my money is tied up with one Bitcoin exchange and I want to use the BTC ATM to get real money, I have to transfer money to an account. For you, a Bitcoin user, it may seem normal because you've spent time in an echo chamber and have become comfortable with it being just a normal thing. A layperson would find this setup ridiculous.
If my money is at bank X and I decide that I need to use bank Y, I simply just have to go up to the machine and use it like any other normal person would. Sure, there is a need to ensure that the card can function on the network the machine is on, but it's more likely than not to just simply work and in most cases your card is setup to use at least two or three networks.
Oh. I guess there are fees when you go and pull money out of an actual money from ATM that doesn't belong to your bank usually. I guess I never added the fact that there was a 2.5% cut taken from my wallet when I used the BTC ATM in question. Most actual money ATMs charge much smaller fees than that and usually it's just a $1.50 on average regardless of the amount.
You literally have Stockholm Syndrome if you are defending the idiocy of the Bitcoin ATM.

The first thing I should do before I go to an ATM is go to the manufacturer's website to pre-load money. Yes. That makes sense.
