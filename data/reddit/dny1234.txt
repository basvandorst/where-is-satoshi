Patterns in volume yes I can see could be useful. Yes the number generator was indeed what I meant. But I think more the point is that people can fool themselves into thinking the patterns are working with selective memory. Possibly if you have enough people following the same faux indicators they could be self fulfilling.

You mean _had_ I’m afraid. When I was selling off my bch I did it in batches over about a week to avoid that risk.

If everything happened as you described we would have 3rd world war and the value of your bitcoin would be irrelevant. Andreas had a good talk on hyperbitcoinisation. Might be worth having a watch.

One of the nicest posts I have read on reddit. Good on you Andreas. You are of the greatest speakers I have watched and while I don’t know you, from afar, seem like a standup guy. I wish you happiness and good luck in your quest.

Yes I agree. Saw the interview with jimmy song too. I’m not a Bch supporter but must admit after that interview I am a little swayed. 2mb block increase is not going to succeed simply for face saving reasons.  We should encourage everyone to start supporting and using Segwit addresses and also increase the block size to 1.5mb. see if it eases the problem. I don’t believe in ‘no fees’.. but the fees today are way too high. No point to bury our heads in sand...There is a problem. I’d love to give a small amount of BTC to co workers and family just to show them it, but can’t, in much the same way mr. ver demonstrated with his 15 dollar give away.
Let’s buy a little time for lightning.

That is fantastic news to read. Health and happiness to Andreas and now some money too. Delighted for him.

which one is ethereum?
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:48:50
I don't think ethereum should present as a sidechain. I think that would miss the proposition. Ethereum should think longer term and big. Interesting ideas, need a little time. Don't rush it, get it right and resist the pressure to submit something less than novel.
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:51:54
Looks good guys. Any idea of the price yet? (really enjoyed the videos Melanie you looked like you're having fun. Keep up the good work)
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:20:03
Thats naive. Lots of organisations which are challenged by bitcoin could happily write off a couple of billion if they thought it necessary
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:53:49
The digital gold idea is long gone. Volatility in the price has put paid to that notion. If bitcoin had wider adoption and many more transactions it may gain stability and in the long term become an investment possibility. But as it is currently, not a chance. I'm with Gavin on this one.

I’ve been listening to his podcasts for about 2 years. Not for the ta as it utter bs, but because he is entertaining. He is constantly making predictions and confirming that he was right. But the reason he is occasionally right is that he makes so many predictions. The ones he is wrong on, he forgets promptly. The verbal gymnastics he performs to justify his positions are a marvel... but I wouldn’t put a penny on any of his predictions.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:00:06
Logically we should insist that there is a 2x fork as they now think it should not happen!
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:46:35
And at 40k
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:56:48
The CME will settle in cash, so there will be no purchasing of the underlying asset. It will have little to no affect on the price, apart from those buying like OP, because they think something will happen that will not. I'm bullish on bitcoin, but not because of CME news.

nov 14 i just read in an article
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:35:57
But he just gets his bitcoin back if it doesnt go ahead. Thought I read that on the site in the conditions. If not fork does not happen
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:37:46
i think you are right there
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:47:33
I think you are missing the fact that the code is running on your own device, so it’s not the web in the sense that you are imagining. By using this you are not trusting or communicating with a third party to interact with  the interface.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:11:31
You are conflating Ecu with euro. Very different things. The individual countries exchange rates floated separately... From your ‘wiki’... “Unlike the ECU, the euro is a real currency”
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:43:52
Lol. No it wasn't. Germany had a dmark... but there are a few other very different countries in the euro area.. like italy france holland greece... same as germany?

To be clear, I do run a full node, but transact rarely. My question is more, how does that help 'support the bitcoin network'
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:19:13
I dont think that is true though, if the 'honest' nodes are not mining. The miners are all connected to each other, much more than they would be to my little node.
I think the best explanation was doc_samson's. This involves running a full node and transacting as there is incentive to knowing about all transactions so that their fee can be collected.
Running a node on its own, does nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:34:15
op, checkout EOS, it might what you are after.
(Im not an investor or promoter of it, just sounds kind of like that which you describe above)
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:06:08
Yes.. should be added
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:29:03
congrats man. hope it goes well for you (and me!)
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:05:40
That does make sense, so thanks for the reply. Am I correct in saying its not just running a node, but also submitting transactions that help support the network. I'm asking, because I do support segwit, but not 2x. Are we saying for those who do not support 2x, should run a full node and submit transactions for the first few days of the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:26:44
If the miners are hostile and there is not a proof of work change, they can instamine to completely mess with the core chain. They could easily do a denial of service by adding and removing hash power to frustrate, in much the same way as bcash is suffering since its inception.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:12:54
Actually a very good post. I agree with you. 12 months might be a little long though. Maybe 4-6 months for the HF deadline.
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:47:46
Very well written. Good read. Well done

No it wasn't. 1.995583. The closest to parity was irish punt at 0.787
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:25:28
When you say support, you mean more moral support, than actual technical support right? Unless you are mining does it really make much difference? Its miners that validate the blocks and then start mining on the next block, so the validation that non mining full nodes do is slightly irrelevant? Am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:51:50
I think you can use pruned nodes now which decrease the space dramatically by downloading and syncing only the utxo set.

Live in Europe and use nfc all the time with my debit card. It’s really handy way to pay euro directly out of fiat account. Can’t imagine ever replacing it to spend my digital gold though.

I think it was the cryptocrap that put him off... and to that he is right. All the alt coins distract, especially a traditional guy like that who thinks it wise to diversify. Normally a good idea, but in crypto world that means you end up with a lot of crap
@_date: 2019-05-08 20:38:37
Yes. I agree with all of that. Bitcoin can’t rollback in the same way. Also their was a time lock in the dao contract which makes the situation different. 40m is nothing is the grand scheme.
