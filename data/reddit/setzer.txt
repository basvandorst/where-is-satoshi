Poloniex only lost around 50-60  BTC though, and they are doing a lot of volume on new coins. Vircurex has been in decline for some time. I don't know how much BTC they are in the red at this moment, but as of November 2013 it was 1218 BTC and they only made 64 BTC profit in the same timeframe:

Yeah, go email the Bitcoin CEO your suggestion.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:05:50
Agree completely. If everything seemed safe with little to no risk the price of Bitcoin would already be sky high. This is where the risk/reward element comes into play, people are betting on an experimental technology essentially.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:15:12
Fairly low volume though...

I mean, do what you want, but I've been  following the development of both extensively and Counterparty is likely going to top MasterCoin. It has a top notch crew behind it and already has a distributed exchange. The one for MasterCoin is actually still in development and bare in mind, they put a 300 BTC bounty on it. It also seems like the rapid progress of Counterparty has put a dent in the price of MSC - it had over a $60 million market cap not too long ago, now down to $47m.
Right now, Counterparty is undervalued at 0.01 BTC/XCP, it will likely jump to at least 0.02 by next month.
It may be a good idea to diversify just in case - but neglecting XCP just because of its proof-of-burn IPO approach is rather short-sighted.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:39:49
Price would probably drop but there's no reason to believe they would drop Bitcoin support. Gox issue doesn't affect the fundamentals, and the risk of an exchange losing your coins was always there. The value of a coin doesn't matter to TD as they instantly cash it out through BitPay anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:36:49


It doesn't need be justified. The person in your example took a HUGE risk and was rewarded for it. Bitcoin could have fell to zero and he would have lost all his money.

Too early to say if they're wrong yet. A lot can happen in another few months.

Just seems like an unfortunate coincidence. I've had my account marked for re-verification before when buying stuff from Steam, even though I buy games on there all the time. I'm guessing they have some algorithm in the background that triggers it.

I bought DOGE at 145 satoshis with 1.5 BTC, withdrawal went through fine. Took a .3 BTC loss overall but that's better than potentially having to wait years to get the money back, or never if they go under.

I'm surprised they actually issued you a refund in BTC. Since the product was priced in USD, they should only be required to send you USD back, not Bitcoin... this avoids the whole ordeal.
But as far as BTC refunds go... Newegg's stance seems fair. I wouldn't expect them to send you more Bitcoin, just like I wouldn't expect them to send less Bitcoin if the price rose 5x since. You got back what you paid, that's all.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:29:44
You haven't lost anything until you sell. Unless you invested more than you can afford to lose, ride this out.

Below $400 is unlikely, it may go lower but we are near the bottom I think.
You can't just say oh it'll back to $100 because that's what the price was before the Chinese buying rally started. A lot has happened since, bigger investors are eying Bitcoin now.

A perfectly reasonable thing to do. If you got in Bitcoin at ultra cheap prices, and later suddenly found it represented over 90% of your wealth, who wouldn't diversify? Even if you truly believe in it, it's the sane thing to do.
According to the article he still has a significant stake anyway, thousands of BTC is by no means a small holding, so painting this as doom and gloom is silly. Plus the fact that someone like Gavin isn't hoarding all his coins is a healthy sign.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:11:57
Coinbase fee is only ~$18 on that amount, you're calling that a rip off and you're about to buy $1800 worth of Bitcoin. Really?

What's a better solution then? Majority of people do not have enough technical knowledge to securely store their coins without a hardware wallet. Even those that do, sometimes slip up.
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:34:45
That's a good thing for the long term. Bitcoin needs more big holders dumping their coins, and not simply waiting for the price to rise.
@_date: 2011-06-25 20:13:29
It's not as if mt gox has been repeatedly fucking us over. Apart from this hack I've had no problem. Don't see anything wrong in giving them another chance.
That said, using multiple exchanges is wise if you have a lot of BTC. However, if you have no immediate plans to trade, I'd leave it in your Bitcoin wallet (that's what I do).
@_date: 2011-06-25 16:25:44
I'd stick with gox. Considering they've already been hacked to bits, this whole ordeal FORCED them to ramp up on security. TradeHill is still very small in comparison, probably hasn't been targeted yet.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:59:58
The idea of banning Bitcoin seems stupid to me. That's like saying, the transfer of money in anything other than USD is outlawed.
Potentially, yes, they could do that. It wouldn't stop trustless digital currencies from flourishing in other parts of world. Innovation in the US would probably be stifled as a result.

Well he deserves it IMO... BTC Guild has been running for years, even back when Bitcoin was worth very little. I doubt that is pure profit either, dealing with the constant DDOS attacks he gets is likely a significant expense.
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:21:15
I think any investments in mining are useless at this point. The difficulty is going to go up like no tomorrow pretty soon. You'll never make the BTC you spent back.
I look forward to when it's only profitable to run ASICs in environments with incredibly cheap electricity. People will be scrambling to get rid of their hardware. It's going to happen sooner than you think. Those that invested in GPUs will be in a better place since they can move to Litecoin.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:43:45
You underestimate the impending exponential rise in difficulty. When it doubles then yes these units would only make 8 BTC, well 8.5 if you want to be exact.
Avalon has 600 units shipping now and another 600 next month...
It's simply dumbfounding to pay that kind of money for only 10GH/s.

Usually there's a 30-day grace period where the owner can re-activate the domain before it goes up for grabs, so he might still have a chance to save it.

The .com, perhaps, but I'm not sure about .xxx. Has that TLD really caught on?
Also, bitcoinporn.xxx would be better. As far as search queries go, 'bitcoin' is used far more often than 'btc'.
So I don't think the domains by themselves are that valuable, might be able to flip them for a profit but unless you develop something I can't see fetching anything substantial.

I wouldn't want to sell something like that on eBay, pretty easy to get scammed. PayPal/eBay tend to side with the buyer, so good luck if you decide to go that route.

You can still get buyers that claim the item didn't arrive as described, or not functioning properly. I have read some horror stories. 
If something like that happened you would be out funds till the issue got resolved, or the buyer ships back the product (in this case, they could make up a bogus claim and mine in the meantime). Since time is money with this product it's a BIG risk in my opinion.
Although if you can get the buyer to pay in Bitcoins you'd be safe.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:46:35
All signs point to batch  shipping before BFL so I think anyone will reach ROI within a month or two. Of course, it's still a gamble.

There's already several hundred ASICs out there. It will continue to rise and adjust as more hashing power is added, there is no limit AFAIK.

@_date: 2013-05-15 22:24:04
I don't think their hosting is the problem, it's the code. The trading engine needs serious fixing probably. There's only so much hardware you can throw at something before you need to go in and fix the code.

Avalon confirmed a batch 4 just yesterday.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:39:33
They won't make the BTC back in a year, two years, or even three years. In a few months having 10 GH/s is going to be like having a 500 MH/s GPU right now.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:31:41
They should have removed it when the court order hit. I withdrawled some funds yesterday not knowing about it and now there's no ETA when I'll get the money back.
EDIT: Finally got a response from Gox, they credited back my account back with the money.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:53:15
I recommend using Dwolla. Takes a little more time but fee is only .25 cents no matter how much you send.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:23:28
It can take up to 4-5 days for the transaction to show up in my experience.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:52:05
Well yeah, but you have to take confirmation lag into account, by the time your transaction has registered the price can go down a good amount. So it's pretty risky.
And just an FYI... yesterday it took 6 hours for a Bitcoin deposit to register for me on Gox.
@_date: 2013-06-30 02:17:21
Good luck breaking even on that...
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:28:21
Also unlike MtGox my Dwolla transfers on CBX go through instantly, highly recommended!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:17:02
Mining difficulty won't drop. It's still worth mining with ASICs, easily.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:29:10
I'd say there's a bigger chance of another player entering the market than BFL shipping.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:12:03
That's the first time I've ever seen them mention it by name. We're moving on up :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:37:22
Wouldn't buy at $80-90. The market is being manipulated by big players, could easily fall to $60 if they pull out suddenly. The huge $1m ask wall at $70 is definitely a manipulation.
I'd just stay patient and buy back in at $50-60. I have done this a few times so far and made nice profit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:33:44
Despite its faults, Gox is still the best exchange. I've tried all the others and they don't compare. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:43:52
People already have them. There's at least 25-30TH/s of ASICs out there.
@_date: 2013-05-18 04:19:36
That makes sense then, I just started using CBX last week.
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:34:19
By tanking I figured you meant sub $90 prices. Was getting all ready to buy more. Disappointed.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:43:26
First, BFL hasn't shipped any units yet. By the time you get one those could only be making a few hundred a month, maybe even less. It's a gamble. I wouldn't buy into an ASIC looking for profit, just for fun.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:12:07
No way it'll hit $30 anytime soon - too many people want to buy. At best we'll see $50 I think.
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:26:46
From the newsletter that went out it seems everyone's batch 1 has shipped outside of users that put down an invalid or incomplete address. Also judging from the jump in network hash power I'd say almost all the Avalons are online now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:20:18
Coinbase prices are matched closely with Bitstamp. It's difficult to get money into BTC-E that's why the price is lower there.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:59:29
MtGox seems fine here, the others are down.
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:37:55
It was exactly the same actually. Specifically mentioned that they defrauded Coinbase and warned of legal action, only in his case the BTC amount was something like -0.005. Unfortunately I can't find the post now, the author might have deleted it.
Also a screenshot was posted and it looked really fishy to me. I would try contacting their support.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:16:15
I scooped up 10 coins at $75. Decent price, unless it goes below $50 I won't feel too much remorse.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:36:17
There will be another correction most likely. If you're short on funds at want to buy in at a low price, I think you'll have another chance. If you have the money, it's best to just buy now though.
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:36:45
I would buy if I was verified on Gox, ugh :(
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:20:20
Lol, double digits are done with. If there is a crash I could only see it going down to $150-200 at worst... simply too many wanting to buy right now.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:32:50
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:57:04
An advantage how? It doesn't make ANY sense from a pure BTC perspective. 10GH/s only gets you 17 BTC a month right now, difficulty will double in a month or so then you are making 8 BTC a month.
These blades will never make that 75 BTC back. No ROI.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:33:26
Is that even legal? If you lost it, you never converted to USD, therefore it's not applicable I would think.
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:35:40
Short term? Yes probably. Long term? I don't think so. Bitcoin has seen many drops in the past... the people that wimp out and sell when the price plummets generally tend to lose out later on.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:04:36
Someone else posted something similar a few days ago. Honestly looked like a phishing email. Beware.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:45:37
I agree. I think we've already seen the bottom at $820.

@_date: 2013-04-27 03:34:31
Why would you do this? Mining on an MBP wasn't worth it a year ago, and it certainly isn't now. Even if you're doing it for fun, just know that it's shortening the lifespan of your laptop.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:55:48
Silly to sell ALL your coins when you already covered your initial investment and then some. It is going back up, you probably sold at the bottom...
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:31:07
Seems so, they should redirect the non-www to www, no idea why they aren't. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:12:59
Doesn't bother me one bit. If it shakes out the get rich quick types that just jumped in that's a good thing. Long term I'm pretty confident the value will go way higher.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:43:11
THat's why you always have fiat available ready for a drop.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:34:01
Maybe they could just use it for adding Steam wallet funds initially.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:09:00
Why would this drop the price to the teens. It's dismal news sure, but nothing has fundamentally changed.
@_date: 2013-07-13 05:30:12
Hypothetical situation here. What if you bought an item using the Bitcoins and then sold it on eBay or whatever? Since the Bitcoins themselves were never converted to cash I don't see how capital gains would apply.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:57:41
I would buy $200 worth of Bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:38:17
Buy... if it goes low enough of course.
@_date: 2013-08-16 06:02:08
If a bank *really* wanted to, it could have its own ASIC developed. Could just contract a design from AMD/Intel/Nvidia. I'm sure they'd be interested if someone was willing to pay big bucks. With their connections to fabs they'd be able to make equipment that none of the smaller players can match in efficiency. Remember, the cost of mining hardware on the network is probably around 20-30 million or so (actually less than that when you consider these devices are being sold at a steep markup)? That's a drop in the bucket to many mega-corps.
The question is would it be worth it? Probably not, as soon as news would get out that the network was being mostly controlled by a single entity faith in Bitcoin would plummet.
But yeah until the network is protected by enough ASICs - we're talking billions of dollars worth - taking majority control over the network is still within reach for any large institution.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:06:00
Should be ok. Trading is separated from the add funds side, I assume so anyway as I never had a problem moving in funds when the rest of the site was lagging. I'd imagine they'd say something if maintenance was affecting it.
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:05:25
Buy Bitcoins? I wouldn't want to risk a $1k+ laptop to make a few cents a day...
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:18:34
I'm expecting it to stay around $70 for awhile, another drop, lots of crying from newbies, and rise to $80 later.
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:23:12
By the time he gets it, it probably won't make the BTC back (factoring current BTC price = price of a Jalapeno). So you are better off just buying BTC right now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:02:50
This has happened before, it's just on a larger scale. It'll rebound. Bitcoin needs organic growth, not growth driven by speculation that causes bubbles like this. People that bought in at $150+ are probably feeling crushed right now, but it was a very risky investment at that price.
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:42:21
Yeah, must be the one I saw too. Can't find the original post though, seems it was deleted.
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:01:16
I've purchased via Coinbase a few times, it's always locked-in the rate at the time of purchase for me. Is this bank dependent or what?

Over 500,000 Avalon chips have been ordered, at 282 MH/s  each that's over 140TH/s. I don't think we are at risk of a 51% attack from ASICMiner but difficulty is going to be increasing BIG time. A lot of people don't realize this...
It's not going to be profitable to run your ASIC pretty soon unless you have really cheap power. Most will be lucky to reach ROI in terms of BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:27:02
Yes, some people are doubling their money and others are losing just as much...
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:59:28
You shouldn't be freaking out about your investment. I would not monitor the price so much if were you. Just hold on to your 0.005 BTC and check up on the value a few months from now.
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:57:50
Yes, but I doubt they'll be able to bring all of that hash power on at once. They say everything will be merely assembled by July. There's quite a bit of testing that needs to be done after that I assume.
Regardless, it's a good thing we have other companies like Avalon and BFL selling chips to end-users. Otherwise majority of hash power would really be in the hands of a few people.
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:11:49
Potential scam, it looks like he copied/pasted a forum post from bitcointalk, that was made by a reputable member.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:24:30
Bad news in China doesn't mean it's going to keep going down. Look at the people than bought at $266 when it fell to the $70s. % wise, that's a much steeper drop than anything we've seen recently and those that held on to their coins made out in the end.
But yeah, this is why you only put in money you can afford to lose. If I invested $2k I'd rather ride it out before cutting my losses at 50%, given how many times Bitcoin has rebounded.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:50:16
You may want to just bite the bullet and get at least one BTC so you're in the game. There's always a chance it could explode and go to $5k+. Then you'll regret not buying that one BTC at $700.

"Also please note that we may have to close the exchange for two hours in the next 12 to 24hrs to add several new servers to our system. "
Why wasn't the exchange temporarily closed when everything started getting overloaded? Seems like it would have been the reasonable thing to do, a lot of people couldn't get on to cancel buy/sell orders that were queued up, ultimately causing them to lose money.
