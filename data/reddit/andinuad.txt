That's a bad justification for being impressed. Given that you state that your friend is conducting research at well-renowned university, it is quite irrelevant that his specialization is not cryptocurrency.

He is right, see  
"The previous section shows: any parabola with the origin as vertex and the y-axis as axis of symmetry can be considered as the graph of a function f(x) = ax^2 with "a" not equal to 0.
For  a&gt;0 the parabolas are opening to the top and for a&lt;0 opening to the bottom (see picture). "

Given that you seem to be informed: what is a realistic max limit for the bitcoin price (for instance a bitcoin can never realistically be valued more than the combined networth of the 10 richest countries in the world) and in how many years do you think we will at around 90% of it?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:57:34


No, because the bitcoin price cannot grow to infinity. It has a maximum price which it will never pass that is below infinity. 
A relevant question is: what's the realistic max price and how long time will be needed to get there?

They are not trading Bitcoins, they are entering contracts stating that they will deliver X bitcoins at time T. They have plenty of time to acquire the bitcoins or just buy a contract stating that they will buy X bitcoins at time T, before time T happens.

I agree with that a better goal would have to set a % increase of purchasing power (defined in a sense of how many goods I can buy with my assets) rather than a currency.

Agreed. 


And why do you do want to find and share info through reddit if not for your own enjoyment and satisfaction?

Real inflation.

In classical elementary economics literature, the utility function only takes a set of goods as input and they look at the jumps in utility as one changes the amount of one type of good. It also implicitly takes a categorical variable as input, namely the person itself.  A such utility function answers the question: "How much utility does person A get from a particular set of goods?".
However, another related question is: "How much utility does person A get from a certain amount of money?".
@_date: 2019-04-19 09:50:53
For my own satisfaction, of course.  Why does anyone use reddit if it is not for their own enjoyment and satisfaction?
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:20:29
Because I think the risk is much higher now than it was when I bought it at a far lower price. Furthermore, I have less use of additional money due to the diminishing utility return of each additional dollar.
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:19:15
Depends on the tax rules of your country and your country itself. In my country, global index funds with low fees yield quite safely those yearly returns adjusted for tax and inflation if you look at a 10 year perspective. 
Reason for why one uses global index funds rather than the one belonging to your own country: your pension may be tied to the economy of your country, your salary is tied to the economy of your country, your ownership of an apartment/house is tied to your country, so choosing global index fund over your own country index funds is a risk mitigation technique.
The taxes and fees matter though, so what is optimal in one country given a certain risk profile, may not be so in another country.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:47:47


From an economic perspective, I don't care because how much purchasing power bitcoin has at that point in time is too hard to assess to any decent accuracy.
@_date: 2019-04-19 11:12:29


You are welcome to elaborate. I didn't refer to the diminishing utility of adding an unit of a good in the classical utility function. I referred to an utility function which takes amount of money as input and made a statement regarding the utility of adding a dollar.
@_date: 2019-04-20 05:48:05


I only use bitcoin as a speculative investment and I don't care whether or not it becomes a commonly accepted currency in the majority of the world. 


Not invest in bitcoins; i.e. I will stick to traditional forms of investing/saving (depends on how you define those terms).
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:03:07
I'll wait for a large reduction in price again. Meanwhile I'll just use traditional savings which essentially yield quite safe 5% annual yield  adjusted for inflation and taxes.
@_date: 2019-04-20 05:19:12


Not really,  essentially you can evaluate the utility of one additional dollar at certain point of time and reach the conclusion that each additional dollar at a certain point of time has diminishing utility returns. I agree with that the utility of one additional dollar changes with time even without inflation since for instance your preferences can change with time and/or the price of goods can change with time (even if they don't change in such way there is an inflation). 


Sure you can make a similar analogy in terms of bitcoins. I.e. that each additional bitcoin has diminished utility returns.

"Trial and error" does not require forming a falsifiable hypothesis while the scientific method does. 
"Trial and error" does not require that the trials are repeatable, replicable and reproducible, while the scientific method does.

I never said I was conservative and I didn't say I was not greedy. One wouldn't gamble on bitcoins if one wasn't greedy giving its volatile development.

 disagrees with you in the sense that they make more than 20% annually. 
That said, they take far less risk than I do. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:31:29


I assume that you by that are referring to "forming falsifiable hypothesis". If that's the case the my answer is: some people at times would try because of bad reasoning. "Trial and error" doesn't put any requirements on the reasoning used to form of the conclusions. 
If you are referring to "trials are repeatable, replicable and reproducible," condition: because of lack of education, bad reasoning and/or lack of time I would guess.
The scientific method is a form of "trial and error" but not all "trial and error" are the scientific method, this is an important distinction and that's why they are not equivalent. The scientific method puts extra requirements that are important for the justification of the results.
Analogously, an apple is a fruit, but not all fruits are apples.

Scientism and science are distinct concepts. I've discussed science. I do agree with the belief that far too many people have a religious approach to science; in my opinion I suspect mostly because they do not understand the scientific method and still they believe in scientific results.

Analysis of past hands allows you to estimate different probabilities of future hands. Knowledge about probabilities of future hands is a type of information about future hands.

@_date: 2018-02-02 16:35:34


Of course it is. You are mixing up two difference concepts. Past hands do not affect the probability of future hands, but past hands do give information about the probability of future hands.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:19:26


So? It is the reasoning that matters for judging whether or not a decision was good, not the outcome of the decision.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:45:40


This assumes that the probability distribution is approximately static. What makes you think that the probability distribution is approximately static in the Bitcoin case?

You are now moving goalposts. I didn't claim that for poker analyzing past hands is the most efficient way to obtain that information about future hands, I claimed that you can obtain such information and specifically provided a such example that was independent of player tendencies. 
Whether or not I can provide examples in which counting past hands would be the most efficient method to obtain an information is irrelevant for the assertion.
Edit: That said it is not hard to think of examples in which it is easier to analyze past events using a computer to obtain accurate estimations of certain probabilities than it is to analytically calculate the probabilities. For instance: given that there are 4 players, what is the probability that the sum of your two drawed cards is in the interval [4, 9] while simultaneously the sum of the three cards of the river neither being 4, 9, 15 nor 19?

The scientific method is far more than "trial and error and learning". I do agree that its name should irrelevant for its credibility, it is the methodology itself that matters.

Does your analysis only work for bitcoin or also on other crypto currency? If it does work elsewhere: what is your success rate among multiple coins?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:10:59
However, if how much you invested is not equal, then the losses are not equal in your example. Which is relevant due to how little people invested in bitcoin in its infancy compared to last year.

Log scale is useful for detecting exponential decay or growth since such would be linear in a log scale.

You do understand that according to your reasoning in the end there can be only two scenarios?
1 .  we will reach a point in the future where there will be no spectacular crashes
2 . The bitcoin value will rise to infinity.
Since the 2nd part is unrealistic since there is not infinite money and will never be infinite amount of money, what makes you believe that 1. will be true?

I've never argued anything regarding "scientism" other than asserting that "scientism and science are distinct concepts",  I've mainly argued regarding "science" and "trial and error" and showed why they are not equivalent. In short because while all apples are fruits, not all fruits are apples. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:23:56


I am saying that regardless of player tendencies, past hands give information about future hands.
To demonstrate it very simply: just look only at your opening hand, then count how many times you get one or more aces and how many times opening hands you investigated. Then divide the former quantity with the latter, that yields an estimation of the probability of having one or more aces in your opening hand. As the number of opening hands goes to infinity, the error of the estimation goes to 0.
Information about probability distribution is a form of information. Hence your previous hands allowed you to obtain information about future hands.

I agree with the belief that many treat science as a religion in the sense that they don't understand the scientific method yet believe in scientific results.

That depends on the current prices of the futures contract, forward contract, options as well as the data being analyzed.
For instance imagine that a forward contract for buying bitcoins in 2 months is very expensive because for some reason the market believes that bitcoin will be extremely expensive in 2 months. Then, if a person performs a better analysis and reaches the conclusion that while bitcoin will be far more expensive in 2 months it will not be anywhere near enough to justify that high forward contract price, then he can make money by taking the short position in that forward contract. If the better analysis is right, then it is riskier to take the long position of that forward contract than it is to take the short position of it. 
Keep in mind that I've implied that the a forward contract to buy a bitcoin in 2 months is more expensive than the current spot price of bitcoins. Spot price = essentially what you pay to buy bitcoins right now.
You may ask: "why take a long position in an expensive forward contract when you can buy bitcoins right now?". The answer to that is: the person may not have the capital to buy bitcoins right now, but will have in 2 months. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:44:21


How is that an argument?
They are taking the short position in a futures contract, forward contract or an option because they believe the price of those on average yields them more money than other ways to invest that money.
This can be done as well even if bitcoin is low in value and most believe it will increase in value. 
For instance you can imagine a bitcoin costing K_1 right now, and a call option costs X and has a strike price of K_2 at maturity time T. 
So assuming that bitcoin will rise in price and this is the consensus, then K_2 &gt; K_1.  However, you may think that for whatever reason, it won't rise as high as K_2 at time T, but will actually cost K_3 at time T such that K_2 &gt; K_3 &gt; K_1. If you hold such belief and your belief turns out to be true, then taking the short position of a call option will generate money for you even if the bitcoin price rises.

Another key aspect is to understand that for random events, patterns may emerge due to the randomness. I.e. there is no reason for such patterns other than randomness. 
I.e. imagine flipping a coin 10k times and ask yourself what is the probability that a such pattern will emerge and how likely it it is for that pattern to also emerge if you were to flip 10k times again.

Science requires the scientific method, which essentially is forming falsifiable hypotheses, test predictions based on those hypotheses through experiment/study, reject the hypotheses if the predictions are not true for that instance of the experiment/study and increase confidence in hypotheses if they are not rejected.
Max Planck certainly formulated falsifiable hypotheses and therefore worked within that part of science.
