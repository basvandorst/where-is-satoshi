Coinbase decided to get into a regulated market. So if they rip off clients, they should bleed for it. Their decision to stick to these rules.

Depends on the country you are living in. And even if you are living in a country where Bitcoin is not being regulated: By using exchanges, you are forcing Bitcoin into regulation.
Coinbase is located in the US and in GB. They KNEW that Bitcoin is treated as a commodity and thus being regulated. So if they want to make their millions by giving up sovereignty, they, at the same time, decided to play by the rules of the government. And whoever uses those exchanges supports regulation. It is as simple as that.

Okay. Very slowly for you.

I helped a lot of people to get into Bitcoin. But only once I ran into trouple: a guy had bought some coins. Months later, he said that I "have his password" and stole all his coins.

I think we are very close in our vision. What I mean is: Once an exchange/broker is involved, they are being regulated. We knew this, they knew it. So using a broker means that a part of our vision has been given up. IF there were a broker which is not regulated, Bitcoin users would have to trust him - again. Me, personally, buy and sell Bitcoin face to face, avoiding brokers (although I must confess: I used to use a broker back in the days... shame on me).

Depends on where you are living. The CFTC has clearly stated that crypto currencies are commodities.

Translated story part 2:
 And the maximum amount? 
Apart from the "pay by invoice" option, Digitec Galaxus has no maximum purchase price - even for cryptocurrencies. 
 Which cryptocurrencies are accepted? 
In addition to the best known, a whole series of so-called Altcoins is accepted: 
* Bitcoin (BTC) 
* Bitcoin Cash (BCH) 
* Bitcoin SV (BSV) 
* Ethereum (ETH) 
* Ripple (XRP) 
* Binance Coin (BNB) 
* Litecoin (LTC) 
* TRON (TRX) 
* OmiseGo (OMG) 
* NEO (NEO) 
 Why should I pay with Bitcoin and Co.? 
Oliver Herren, Digitec co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer: 
 "Because you have some and you want to use them?  Or because you can not turn them into real money because your bank does not accept the money?  Just because you can do it?  Or because you like to try new things? » 
It should be noted that it can of course be financially interesting to pay for real goods with cryptos.  Of course, that depends on the price development.  
 What happens in case of massive price fluctuations? 
When you buy something from Digitec or Galaxus, there is a **fixed exchange rate for 15 minutes** .  This means that as a buyer you do not have to fear bad surprises. As you know, the Bitcoin price is extremely volatile.  Say: The price you pay for these and other cryptocurrencies can only vary greatly in one day.  In exceptional cases, crashes or, on the contrary, exploding courses may occur.  For example, if something happens around the world that makes the owners of cryptocurrencies nervous - or drives demand.  The same, sometimes inexplicable, phenomena can be observed, such as trading in equities and securities. 
 Is that safe at all? 
Yes.  As secure as online transactions can be.   
 Why is Digitec doing that? 
It is primarily a PR coup.   The largest Swiss online retailer can thus score points with a younger,  technology-savvy clientele and present themselves as progressive. Accepting cryptos as a means of payment entails no financial risks for the company.  The transactions are handled by an external service provider.   This means that the Swiss online trader does not enter into any  currency risk, but instead receives the current amount of Swiss francs  from Coinify. Digitec co-founder Oliver Herren: 
 "Cryptocurrencies are fascinating and could become a relevant means of  payment in e-commerce - we would like to support this development." 
It should be noted that Digitec can also benefit from the sale of cryptocurrency products.  The offer includes crypto-wallets, which are physical disks that serve as a kind of cryptos safe. 
 What about black money and money laundering? 
It can not be ruled out that darknet drug traffickers are trying to convert their illegal activities into cryptos.  Basically, however, that crypto currencies only ensure a supposed anonymity.  All transactions are public and can be traced.  In addition, criminals are likely to be primarily interested in cash and not goods. Alex Hämmerli, spokesman for Digitec Galaxus, emphasizes: 
 «Anonymous orders are not possible with us.  That scares off.  We also apply all security measures that we apply to other means of payment.  We report suspected cases to the responsible authorities.  If the suspicion hardens, we block affected accounts and support the authorities in their work. » 
 How easy is it to pay with Bitcoin and Co.? 
The procedure is relatively simple and quick to explain: 
* You go in the online store of Digitec or Galaxus «To checkout». 
* Now you choose the payment option "cryptocurrencies". 
* At the checkout you will be redirected to a website of Coinify.  There you can select from a list the desired means of payment. 
* Now you get a conversion rate valid for 15 minutes as well as the  payment details as text and as a QR code and can trigger the transaction  with a so-called *crypto-wallet* . 
* The payment confirmation by Coinify should normally be made within a few minutes. 
 How high are the fees? 
Coinify charges a conversion fee of 1.5 percent of the purchase amount.  **Digitec Galaxus does not charge any fees for cryptocurrency payments.**  For comparison, PayPal is with 2 percent fees, a more expensive  provider for online shoppers, holds the head of communications of  Digitec Galaxus, Tobias Billeter.  Twint, on the other hand, is much more attractive in this regard, because it's free. Accordingly, Twint is becoming increasingly popular with customers, while PayPal is declining.   The fact that Digitec Galaxus still offers PayPal as a digital payment  solution has historical reasons: "PayPal was the first provider". 
 What about Apple Pay and Samsung Pay? 
Tobias Billeter explains: 
 "We are monitoring exactly what our customers want for further payment options.   If we find that the demand for Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or other  providers is high, we will implement further payment solutions. » 
 Is it possible to pay with cryptos in the Digitec shops? 
Not for the time being.  "Currently we offer this option only in our two online shops," says the media spokesman. 
 Can German customers also pay with cryptos? 
Not yet.   The Digitec-Galaxus spokesman said: "First of all, we have activated  this option for our customers in Switzerland." If the offer in  Switzerland was a success, they wanted to extend it to [Germany]( as well. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:11:47

Translated story part 1:
 Digitec Galaxus accepts Bitcoin and Co. - you need to know 
 A bang in Swiss e-commerce: The country's largest online retailer  introduces cryptocurrencies as a means of payment - making it suitable  for mass production.  Here are the main questions and answers. 
 What happened? 
Customers of Digitec and Galaxus can now pay with [crypto-currency]( ("cryptos") when shopping online.  In addition to [Bitcoin]( , the largest Swiss online retailer accepts a number of so-called Altcoins.  More about that right now. 
 What products can you pay for using Digitec Galaxus with cryptos? 
All that the Migros subsidiary has in its product range.  According to their own statements, these are around 2.7 million articles;  from the shoehorn to wheat beer to the gaming PC. 
 Why is that important? 
Digitec Galaxus is the largest online retailer in [Switzerland]( .  If the market leader in local e-commerce takes such a step, the competitors will register exactly and follow suit if necessary. 
What is certain is that cryptos will finally become mass-marketable as a means of payment in Switzerland. 
So far, among other things, you could buy SBB tickets with Bitcoin.  Since 2017, the Federal Railways have been cooperating with Sweepay, a company based in Zug.  However, the offer was criticized in media reports as expensive and intransparent. 
Digitec Galaxus does not make these mistakes.  For payment, you have chosen another international partner and make the conversion rates transparent. 
 Who invented it? 
A team of software engineers at Digitec Galaxus called Team Specter. 
The new payment option came about as part of a pilot project together with the Swiss e-payment specialist Datatrans AG.  The transactions are processed with the crypto payment [processor Coinify]( .  The Danish-based fintech company operates worldwide. 
 What is the minimum amount to pay with cryptos? 
200 francs. 
 This minimum order value increases the likelihood of a quick payment  confirmation, says Digitec-Galaxus spokesman Alex Hämmerli.

I'd dd the drive first. If there is a wallet.dat: copy it out if the dd image, using autopsy. Install a core wallet on your computer and put the copied wallet.dat in the bitcoin data folder.
Let core update. If the wallet wasn't encrypted, you may see the actual balance.
If the wallet is password protected, it is likely that the previous owner used an existing password. Well possible that you find some in the relevant files.
If none of them works, there still are a couple of other possibilities which require a bit more technical details from your side.
And: if you prodhce a dd-image of the drive and it dies while doing so... there also are possibilities to rescue the dead drive.
So heads up. In the worst case, you end up with an empty wallet and some knowledge in computer forensics.

So he is not for a leader, yet he supports a politic of ethnic cleansing? Have you ever checked what he says in Europe? Have you read the plan of the Movement? Have you gone to Rome to see what he's doing? Have you checked the policy of his office in Belgium?
You say he is not for dictatorship, yet supports people who want to establish exactly this: A dictatorship.

Well, according to your words, I have no clue. Now if you tell me that I have no clue, it clearly means that you have enough wisdom and knowledge to make this judgment. So if you are so wise, it should not be any problem at all to tell me and the audience of our little dispute

b) why Bannon is not a fascist.

Wrong. But now that you bet: bet lost. I am one of those old fashioned anarchists. You know: those guys who were discussing the idea of a global currency before you and me were born. But now that I have won my bet: how much have I won. And in Bitcoin, I assume.

Lol. Mussolini invented nothing. He was the first one to use fascism in a broad political movement. But fascism is older. What you are doing is falling for the definition of the USSR, and they were pretty successful in defining fascism.
If you look back in time, before Mussolini, there were other fascist movements or even political movements which were branded as fascism (for example sociofascism, the term used by communists against socialists.)
Most Americans see fascism as it was defined by Matthew Lyons. And frankly: I tend to agree with him on many parts. Which leads me to my conclusion that Bannon is a fascist.
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:42:19
So you wouldn't call Mussolini a fascist? The Ustascha? The falangists?
It is very easy to reduce fascism to Hitler, because then you don't have to think about your own position.

Italy’s first Fascist government applied a large-scale privatization policy between 1922 and 1925. The government privatized the state monopoly of match sale, eliminated the State monopoly on life insurances, sold most of the State-owned telephone networks and services to private firms, reprivatized the largest metal machinery producer, and awarded concessions to private firms to build and operate motorways.

Isn't there a potential other risk in Ver's action? Basically, he publicly announces that he will perform potentially fraudulent actions. Now if people really buy B2X, believing it is BTC, they could file a lawsuit against him. Now he works with several companies which support him/B2X. I'm not a lawyer, but doesn't this bear the potential risk of a RICO-case which could not only damage him but a big part of the BTC-infrastructure, too?

But he also is indicted for explicitly running a money laundering scheme for cybercriminals. I see what you mean, but the risk may be in some small details. For example: You traded early 2016 Bitcoin with a value of 5'500 US$, this is, according to the DoJ's calculation, a trade with a value of 11'000 US$.
This lawsuit bears some potential threats which will imho unearth during the next couple of years.

No. The police would take all cars of the car dealer and keep them, saying thet were used for committing a crime. Read the indictement carefully...
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:39:53
Yes. But this doesn't bar me from reading the indictment. You should try it, too.  Just an example: If you are a German citizen doing business with a US bank (just as an example) and you die, the US asks the kids of this person to act according to US laws, even if they never had any connection to the US. If the US laws do violate the domestic laws and the kids therefore do not comply to the US requests, they better don't get anytime to the US.
Now if you read the indictment, it may be enough to have a server in the US or to use Cloudflare to find yourself in legal trouble...

Thanks :) she likes art :)
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:17:55
Read the indictment again. "The defendants thus attracted and maintained a customer base that was heavily reliant on criminals." Or: "BTC-e was an international money-laundering scheme [...], catered to criminals - and to cybercriminals in particular."
I can't find anywhere in the indictment any clue as to any legitimate use of BTC-e. So what you say - "nobody knew that money laundering was going on there" - contradicts with what the DoJ says.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:58:06
The indictment is about money laundering, not about syphoning money out of anybody's account.

My solution: For every day I don't smoke, I buy BTC for 20 bucks at the ATM.

If the DoJ would sentence all CEOs of criminal banks in the US, the Donald would make sure that from day one on they would be served with caviar and champagne.
The whole thing is just an attempt to get total control over all Bitcoin related business.
“We will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters,” said acting FinCEN Director Jamal El-Hindi, “including virtual currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate U.S. AML laws.”
Doing business **in** the US means having US clients, a .com-domain and accepting payments from US banks.
Technologically speaking, the US is already today a third world country. As a consequence of El-Hindi's remark, one should exclude all of the US from any Bitcoin-related activity and just let them go further down the drain.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:21:23

What are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak
What is Mossack Fonseca, how big is it, and who uses offshore firms? Key questions about one of the biggest ever data leaks
Read more
About 200 people with US addresses have so far been revealed as clients of Mossack Fonseca, the firm at the center of the Panama Papers leak. Compared with countries such as China, Switzerland, Russia and the United Kingdom, the number is small.
The anomaly may be because it’s so easy to create a vehicle to hide your money and your identity in the US that there’s no need to mess with Panama, according to Shruti Shah, vice-president of programs and operations at Transparency International, an anti-corruption organization.
“You don’t really have to go to Panama or other tax havens. They are not the only ones making it possible for corrupt officials and other criminals to launder their money. You can do it in every state in the US,” explained Shah.*
 
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:37:48
So you imply that the US is against money laundering? You seem to be a bit brainwashed.
If a European wants to launder money, guess where he goes to? Right. US. Delaware, for example. In the financial world, the US is *the* place to go for laundering assets.
You ever asked yourself why FATCA is a one-way-street? Because the USA is the hotspot of money laundering and would go down further the financial drain if they would act according to FATCA.
Ever tried to open a bank account as an American in Europe. Close to impossible. If I, as a European, want to open a bank account in the US, I call, they read me for two hours their terms, then I get a parcel with checks, debit- and creditcard and all that shit. KYC? AML? Forget it.
You seem to have drunk too much of your governments hypocrit-cocktail.
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:22:40
It's even more hilariously ironic that citizens of free countries who used BTCe according to domestic laws have no access anymore to their funds because of the US governments actions. It reminds me a bit of the US embargo against Russia which is, in fact, nothing else but an attempt to sell their on gas overprized.
The US has become a bully, and a lot of brainwashed people are living there. “God created war so that Americans would learn geography", Mark Twain once said. Now it would be nice God would invent finally something else so that citizens of the US can learn what freedom is.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:16:42
Actually, a whole industry in the US is based on money laundering and tax evasion. And the laws were - partially - built "around" this shady business. At the end of the day, AML and KYC are the perfect excuses for getting rid of competitors.

I went through this with Liberty Reserve. I had obtained them legally, used legally. Was able to show them all the paperwork. The LR was even in my tax records.
Did I get my assets back? Of course not.
First they wrote me that the only way to get my documentation into their proceedings would be to let them translate by a translator and then put an authorization from a public notary and an Apostille on every single document.
Furthermore, they asked me to send them not only my bank records, but also bank records of a company which I happened to use a shareholder of and which had nothing to do with LR.
IF I had followed their requests, I had spent more money than I had in LR **and** would have violated our domestic laws which would have sent me back then straight to prison.
So their whole programs for paying back was and is one big rip-off.

You seem to be living in a bubble... try to read this one:
Especially this part may be interesting and shows how FATCA is nothing but a tool of the US to get more pieces of the cake:
**The USA will not provide its ‘reciprocal’ FATCA partners any information about the following types of accounts held at US financial institutions:**
**Depository (i.e., cash) accounts held by entities. This includes entities that are resident in the FATCA partner country, or,**
**Non-cash accounts, whether held by individuals or entities, even those that are resident in the FATCA partner country, unless the accounts earn so-called US-source income.**
**Furthermore, the US will not provide information to its ‘reciprocal’ FATCA partner about the “controlling” persons of any entities having accounts in US financial institutions. This is so regardless of whether the entities are from the reciprocal partner country or from third countries, and even if those entities are owned and controlled by residents of the reciprocal partner country.**
**Given the paucity of information that will be given by the US to its IGA “reciprocal” partner, it seems obvious that many non-US persons will continue to feel quite secure in holding accounts at US financial institutions, despite FATCA “reciprocity” with their home countries.   This could be a nice boon to the US financial market in the brave new world of financial transparency!  Is it possible?  Is FATCA actually poised to help the (holier-than-thou) USA to become an even more enticing tax haven?**
I can't say wether or not BTC-e really did anything wrong but stomping on the feet of the US regulators. Reading the indictment does not give a great deal of information. And reading the DoJ's news releases reminds me of listening to Trump: Many words without saying something.
But what I clearly see is that this could become the blueprint for other exchanges all over the world: Comply with US law, or we fight you.

I'm against the concept "one country - its laws for the world"

You can take away the doubts by disclosing some basic facts about your operation. Like: What machines do you use for mining? Where are they located? Since when are you mining? ANY proof that you are doing more than just begging people to send you their BTC would help.

Yep. Look like old Spondoolies... Wasn't it the farm of Bitcoin-Cowboys?

May be relevant if you know that Bitmain is producing chips for spying on people this way.

I never used BTC-e, so I really don't know how you come to this conclusion.
And as for LR: This was indeed used by shady persons. As Goldman Sachs is and many other banks. But back in the time, it was the only way to send my daughter abroad money quickly and without getting charged a fee like done by banks.
And finally: I don't think that BTC-e is the problem.
In my opinion it could become a problem for Bitcoin.
One of the ideas behind Bitcoin was pseudo-anonymity. There are countries which grant their citizens privacy and data protection - one thing the US government hates.
**If** the case of BTC-e ends successful for the DoJ, it could become a blueprint for **all** exchanges all over the world. I do not speak money laundering the word, not at all. But I warn that the US could try to control all transactions in the Bitcoin world.

I have this rare condition where the word "fake" appears while reading stuff like this.
