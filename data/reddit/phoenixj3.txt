I won't engage your other points, because you seem to have made up your mind, but I will help you out and say that if you don't want them to call ask to be put on the "do not call list."  This is necessary, because yelp has high turnover in its salesforce.  Yelp uses salesforce crm software to manage their contacts and the employee you're talking to will insert a note on your account saying do not call; that way all future employees will see it.  That should do it.  I just realized I've been assuming you own the business; if you're not the owner, but are just an employee and you tell them not to call, they may ignore you.  If the owner tells them not to call again, at least when I was there, we were required to stop calling and make that note in salesforce.
I have no idea what facebook does, but facebook is not yelp.

I agree that would help, but I believe OP's original point is that FAQ's and how to guides will only go so far.  True mass market penetration of cryptocurrency won't happen until the average person can use it easily without having to learn about how it works or how to secure it.  Thus the need for trusted 3rd parties who can handle "all the technical stuff" for the average man who likes his easy to use credit card.

Yes.  No one would be forced to use a third party, but they provide convenience and piece of mind so many people would choose to use one; fees will likely be very low due to free market competition and the companies will make profit off the transaction volume.

The linked video is actually very favorable to bitcoin.  Each talking head asks the CEO of Bitpay a basic question and then they actually let him answer.  It's like they dumbed things down/simplified things for the audience. They discuss the potential future uses of the protocol as well as the currency.  He's not the best speaker, but he handles things just fine.   The bloomberg folks conclude by saying bitcoin could be a real threat to visa as long as transaction fees stay low.  They also speculate that companies may soon be forced to adopt bitcoin to stay competitive in low-margin industries.
@_date: 2014-04-29 05:11:24
It's fine that you don't like sales calls.  They'll stop calling if you just say "please stop calling me and add me to the do not call list" 
As a former Yelp employee (advertising sales) who used to call businesses, I can say that these allegations of extortion or paying more for better reviews are all baseless -there's a reason all the lawsuits against Yelp for these things keep getting dismissed before trial - Yelp is not extorting businesses! It's just a misunderstanding. Business owners sometimes mistake correlation with causation. 
 Example: I call a business and they say "no thanks" to advertising with Yelp. The next day they get 2 negative reviews that I/yelp had nothing to do with. Some business owners will assume that Yelp wrote those negative reviews to extort them, simply because the two events are close in time. That kind of misunderstanding is where most of these allegations of review manipulation come from. You can see it clearly above when bakutogames says "We had no bad reviews until we refused their service."  Correlation in time mistaken for causation.
The other misunderstanding is related to Yelp's review filter - yes it uses a secret algorithm; so does google and many other sites that don't want businesses to try to game the system (get all their friends to write fake 5 star reviews &amp; slam competitors with fake 1 star reviews). The filter is applied equally to all businesses, advertising or otherwise, but some business owners prefer to believe that they have been singled out and persecuted by Yelp... sigh. The truth: If most of your reviews on Yelp are negative, you need to make some changes to your business/the way you treat customers.
Note: I was part of a successful class action lawsuit against Yelp for unpaid overtime.  I don't like the company, Yelp, but I do like and use their product.  Yelp allowing me to sort by bitcoin accepting businesses is useful and a significant step towards mainstream currency adoption.
TL;DR: Yelp treats their employees poorly, but is fair towards businesses. There is no extortion and bakutogames' allegations are baseless.  It's great that Yelp has taken this step to add bitcoin notification/sorting.

Torguard VPN takes Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin.

This is the most straightforward answer.  
I'll augment  to suggest you use a reputable wallet to receive the bitcoins:
I like Electrum, but take your pick.
 I suggest "Vault of Satoshi" to convert the bitcoin you receive to CAD or just skip this step and keep the bitcoin in your wallet.  (assuming you can stomach the risk of fluctuating value).

He openly admits bitcoin might become very important/valuable in the future, he's just uninformed right now and so is personally not investing  in something he doesn't understand.

All he seems to be saying is that the focus should be on the creation of  trusted 3rd parties, a so-called "bitcoin ecosystem" (payment processors/escrow services, credit card issuers, etc.).  Teaching people not to trust exchanges, education about paper wallets and suggesting that they use bootable usb keys with linux, etc. won't work.  Most people still don't make backups of their files.  They know they should but they won't do it because it seems "too hard" or "too complicated," or "will take too long to setup."
At the moment bitcoin in general is just too complex for the average person who will only switch to Bitcoin when it's just as easy and safe as using their existing credit card.
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:45:31
That may be, but they could communicate better and retain more customers/avoid posts like this...
The fact that they are probably complicating things with software is part of the problem.  It's pretty simple to put in place an efficient customer service queuing system with off the shelf software/email and general policies like responding to every email within 48 hrs. even if just to say "Sorry you're having an issue; we're looking into it and will give you an update in x days."
I believe they just don't care and think customer service is not an important part of their business; at least not important enough to staff a customer service dept. properly. More bodies would help, but there's no desire to hire.  They prefer to put out fires on reddit while trying to code their way out of trouble, rather than put in place people and policies that prevent these customer service problems in the first place.
@_date: 2014-04-29 08:08:59
Yes.  There are a lot of small businesses and yelp calls ALL of them until they either buy advertising or say they're not interested.  With that many contacts, there are bound to be some coincidences like yours.  If I were in your shoes I imagine I'd make the same error, and assume fraud, because it really does look that way from your perspective. I also know that some organizations really do extort businesses (the BBB comes to mind).  I was just trying to share my firsthand insight into Yelp.
@_date: 2016-03-26 02:31:54
It doesn't take two days to shoot the customer an email though.  You don't have to solve the customer's problems right away, just contact them so they feel listened to and not ignored.
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:56:34
The problem is that companies like Fold and Purse fear a legal minefield when it comes to using trademarked names like Amazon and Starbucks in their marketing efforts.  There's also a limit to the # of giftcards out there that will be used/sold at a discount.  If these companies were widely adopted, they would quickly have to lower those discounts.

I think Monero has the most promise for privacy/anonymity
@_date: 2016-03-31 01:18:16
Just use Monero for real anonymity.  Bitcoin has an advantage/distinction in being transparent and traceable by default.
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:58:07
That right there is a problem that is solvable.  Other companies manage to do it; it's not very difficult.  It does require having several people on staff just to handle customer service, internal communication &amp; delineated responsibilities, and clear policies that are refined over time.  More importantly, it requires fostering a company culture that includes caring about keeping customers happy and retaining them.
I love coinbase, and still recommend them to people, but they are dropping the ball when it comes to customer service and retention.
@_date: 2016-03-26 07:28:15
The point? It's the difference between good customer service, and bad. You either make customers feel valued and retain them, or you don't.

Thanks for sharing your perspective. You seem to be of the opinion that copyright is all that drives artists to produce art.  Life without "movies, books, dance and song" would suck, but it's disingenuous to suggest that eliminating copyright or participating in copyright infringement would lead to such a world.  There are plenty of artists who would continue to create art, simply for their own pleasure and the pleasure of sharing it with others who appreciate their creations.  Perhaps you and other "professionals" would quit art and do something else if you weren't being paid to produce photographs.  Fortunately there are plenty of photographers who would do it for the joy of the hobby and share it simply to hear "I love your photos."
I do recognize that this does impact the livelihood of professional artists such as yourself. Life isn't fair.  At one time technology made it difficult/costly to reproduce art, so artists could expect to be paid for their work. This isn't the case anymore with digital files that can be copied perfectly for free.   It's true you invested lots of capital and time in your craft, and it must feel awful to have this go to waste. The bottom line is that what you produce is no longer scarce and many people feel you are not entitled to their cash just because you made an investment that didn't pan out due to modern technology changing the game.  They are not stealing from you (there is no taking; you lose nothing when someone views your work), they're just not handing you money.
@_date: 2016-03-26 02:18:40
I disagree.  Any company over 10 people should be able to handle their customer service better than Coinbase has demonstrated.  If they can't, something is wrong with their processes and/or they need to hire more people.

 How long is a bit? There's no guarantee lightning will work it all, let alone in the near future. It could be vaporware. Also, increasing the block size a bit doesn't threaten decentralisation. Hard drive space is cheap and becoming cheaper. Same with bandwidth. Artificially constraining the block size driving fees up and hence reducing incentive to use the network is a problem that needs to be addressed now since peak usage regularly fills up blocks. People don't want to switch to a currency that only works reliably most of the time.

I'm running the latest version of the mycelium app for android available on the google play store: v2.4.3.  I have no idea what the other guy is running
I've tried restarting the app, restarting my phone, changing the settings to use https or tor.  I haven't tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app from google play.  Is there any reason to believe that could work?  
**So, what's the best way to proceed?**  Should I just attempt a double-spend and transfer all coins out of my mycelium wallet?  Then seperately arrange to send this guy his bitcoin?  If I do that, would that eliminate the risk of the original transaction broadcasting at some point in the future and taking BTC out of my wallet?  
If we just wait, will it time out? 
Any idea how it happened/how we can prevent it in the future?
Edit:  I'm going to try and double spend the btc; then if that succeeds, send a new txn to a new public key the guy I traded with just sent me.  Hopefully that will solve things.
Edit 2: Double spending worked and I was able to successfully send btc to the other guy.  The question is, why did this happen and is mycelium still ok to use going forward? 
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:51:26
Can you help me out?
I executed a trade through mycelium trader earlier today.  I was paid cash and released the bitcoin from escrow but it's been showing a "transaction confidence" of 0% for hours.  The guy who paid cash is worried.  My wallet does not show the transfer so I don't have a txid.  I can't abort the trade (sent through mycelium escrow) and I already have this guy's cash, but he doesn't have his bitcoin! I'm afraid he'll think I'm trying to rob him.  I don't want to send him the bitcoin another way now since I'm afraid at some point the original transaction will go through.  What do you suggest?  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:49:52
(copy/paste from e-mail, so others can use for reference)
Thanks for the fast reply.  My fee is actually set to "priority" in the settings.  In any case, I don't know if the other guy sees the transaction in his wallet but it continues to show "transaction confidence 0%" for both of us in the active trade chat area.
**It's not just that it's taking a long time to confirm; I don't think the transaction was broadcast at all!**
 At least, I don't see any evidence that it was broadcast (no txid and my wallet does not show the transaction) aside from the active trade area saying "you have sent xxx BTC."
If I send him the same amount again directly on Sunday, is there any chance that mycelium will in the future send the 1st transaction since it still shows in active trades (I did click the received cash button and enter may passcode)?  Or will the mycelium trader escrow automatically cancel/refund me the bitcoin by then?  I don't want to send the same payment twice unless I can be sure.  This guy is a stranger and not someone I can trust to refund the money if that happens!
Thanks again for the help
