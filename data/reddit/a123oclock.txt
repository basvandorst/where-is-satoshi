Basically, yeah. Not after sympathy I just want to know if there is any point in me chasing it up

It was my own stupid fault, and looking back now i don't know how i didn't see it coming. So i'm not after any sympathy at all here. Basically it was my first time buying bitcoin so i was unsure of the procedure.
I found someone to trade with, then saw the bank details and it said i needed to make payment first, so i did. Then he messaged asking why i had sent payment already, and asked me to cancel the trade and he will refund. So I did (facepalm).
He then said he couldn't refund yet as he was locked out of his secure key and he would ring them and try again. This is when i knew i had fucked up.
i have messaged him and not heard anything since. He does have 100% feedback, but i guess that means nothing

I have sent the support ticket and I will keep you updated. Next time I know who to buy my bitcoin from! Thanks again, you're a star.

I was in a way. The support team just credited me the bitcoin from the seller after i provided evidence of paying and they saw what he said in the chat
