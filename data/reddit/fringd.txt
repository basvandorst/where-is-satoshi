Oh... No wonder the transaction fees are so high.

The end game is a network of channels where Bitcoin can flow fast and cheap. If you and me are connected by the network we can send Bitcoin to each other through intermediaries without trusting them. Instead of waiting an hour and paying $10 in fees we can verify in a second and pay the intermediaries a pittance. This makes it practical for me to buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin.
People sometimes talk about it as a decentralized network, but in reality it should be much cheaper to have a few channels open to very well connected hubs. I imagine there will be a few dozen big hubs that will all have channels with each other, and everybody else will just connect to the lightning network through 1 or 2 of these hubs. This would be more like the current internet graph, where most people just have an ISP, and all the big networks peer with each other, and who knows maybe they squabble over interoperation agreements too ��. Hopefully not.
Okay that's the big picture, now one final detail. The individual channels that make up the network are all enforced by the main block chain. If there is a bad actor they can freeze up the funds for a while but you will get your Bitcoin back when the channel expires worst case. Because of this failsafe the hubs should have every incentive to be good actors. But I wouldn't want 100% of my Bitcoin tied up in the LN just in case. Probably using Bitcoin directly is still best for big transfers.
