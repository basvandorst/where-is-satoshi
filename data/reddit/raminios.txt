I always assumed he was just the only on-site consultant from the company who created the software.

So we're not allowed to speculate unless it's positive?
You're right, but there's no point in only pointing it out on the negative outlook comment.

Anyone who thought the top of this particular bubble was as high as 200k was mental, let alone 2m, but that's just my opinion. There were a lot of clear factors indicating what was going to happen in this case, and this guy followed them like a lot of others did. This was clearly a bubble from the get go. 
When Snapchat has a feed of fucking Mas and Pas investing their retirement in cryptos with absolutely no understanding of what its purpose or use is, you know it's bad.
This guy diversified, sold during the rise, sold during the fall and as a result made a good profit without needing to predict exact figures like you're suggesting. If it did by some bizarre set of circumstances fly to 20k or 2M, this guy would certainly have still been holding some, and have still made a hefty profit, because of his diversification, he covered the outcomes.
He was lucky in the same way that a very probable outcome happened, yes, but he had most outcomes covered, something which pays off in the long run.

Completely different and irrelevant to what the above poster did. A specific price isn't important, and the timescale you're putting is completely useless as there's far too much room for things to change. 
I can unreservedly tell you this is not the lowest price that bitcoin will reach, which is enough to go on for now.

"Just Lucky"
He took an educated look at what has happened in the past, speculated on what he thought would happen in the future and acted accordingly. Sure there's some luck in there, but there's a hell of a lot of more to it than just luck.
