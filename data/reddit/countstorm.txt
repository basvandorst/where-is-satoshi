Well said- fortunately I "only" lost around 30k worth of fiat, tiny amount compared to some..

Well aren't you a delightful person.

They claim a bug in the system, but it seems doubtful. I am probably going to have to file fraud with my bank as they have taken my money and refuse to release my BTC :/

I would really appreciate if I could get my issue taken care of, you guys left me in the dark. My username on coinbase is Storm.

Hey Rees, you guys are basically ignoring the flood of emails I sent about trying to buy and being blocked. Would be nice to get some clarification as to why..

I have 29 that Coinbase won't give me access to  :(

Around 55k and counting.. bought in at 295-395-650-800-1010USD.....   We're all in this together. At this point I have little choice but to hold. 
China is dropping the price, we are plundering their cheap coins. This of course drops the price down to the level of their coins. Once they are dried out entirely if demand continue it's safe to say the price will rise once more. Just my thoughts.

Wow.. apparently this is a trend :/ .. sigh. Hard to not think something is aloof with that many instances. In my case they claimed my bank did a chargeback.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:39:22
I heard they honor the price that you purchased at, not the case?
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:03:24
I would love to, as a matter of fact. I will right now

It took about a week of "pending" with the date pushing further and further
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:16:51
Writing back-  as of now, I still have not received my coins or my money and Coinbase is utterly ignoring me. I am considering getting law agencies involved but if there is another solution I would be pleased to hear it.
