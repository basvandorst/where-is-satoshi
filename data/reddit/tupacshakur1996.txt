Well why aren't you out there feeding the homeless for free? Do you think hungry homeless people care if he skins some cash of the top? If it wasn't for him they would still be hungry....

Why not both?

Yeah fuck dogecoin, no one will ever use a currency to buy gas that sounds like a 14 year old named it...

He is famous across the world buddy.... You must not watch the UFC...

I would pitch in 0.1 BTC, plus I love Joe! 
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:26:57
So debatable, much wow, little smarts...

Because he is a very successful man, who made his success through hard work and dedication, those are qualities that other humans respect....

No OP you're a dick...

Yeah but there is already kind of a mob mentality in this sub. Even if you try to have discussion about the weaknesses of BTC you get down voted into oblivion. Not to mention the other shit that the people in this sub down vote. It's like a lot of subscribers from r/PCmasterrace are in this sub...

NS Sports, w/ BTC... 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:13:03
How can you send BTC just by email? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:53:43


This is easy? Remember you are trying to include the lowest common denominators of society. I don't think uneducated people will be fond of multiplying by 1 million.

Lol I have had a coinbase account for over a year and in that time bought, spent or sold more than 5 BTC, I think I have enough experience in BTC to comment on the situation. Also never used any of your complex security procedures and never had any stolen or misplaced. Guess you are just wrong all around huh? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:10:02
The whole never let the computer go online thing is a stretch... No? I mean your telling me if I come to Reddit and set my Fantasy football line up on ESPN, that the next day I'm going to check my wallet and all my BTC will be gone? Seems a little bit over the top. Also ridiculous to expect broke college students to be able to afford a 2nd offline machine just to make sure there money isn't stolen. One of the fatal flaws of BTC in my opinion. It will never attract the masses because people don't want to go through all the security measures just to protect their money.

You sound like the type of dude who takes life too seriously. Love, laugh, and learn buddy, the world is not some cold heartless place. It is what you make it. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:11:21
Did they just randomly attack you? Or were you visiting fishy sites..? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:20:14
This, seriously you expect me to pay taxes on a few hundred dollars profit I am making selling some BTC that I held onto for awhile, lol fuck that. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:36:58
Bitcoins do not get rid of mortgages, don't be arrogant just because you're rich... 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:42:22
Yeah I was honestly confused after reading that guy's response to my comment. I assume English is not his 1st language, which may explain some of the confusion I guess?
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:10:43
Actually Reddit loves the word "This" 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:22:47


LOL, seriously WTF? Where in the world did I say "Cannabis merchants are dumb apes"?
I think you are reading a little too much into what I wrote. I smoke weed everyday and have money invested in BTC. I think you need a chill pill dude. I was just saying when you buy weed in person 99.99% chance you **DO NOT** pay w/ BTC, but if you buy online, than there is a possibility you do pay w/ BTC.
But please remind me once again where I said **"Cannabis merchants are dumb apes"**
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:46:24
How/Why would you compare weaknesses to myths. Doesn't that say something about the Bitcoin community in general? I used to like hanging out here, but within the past 6 months thoughtful discussion has gone out the window, and it's all "To the moon... Lolz" 
People act like Bitcoin is perfect, it isn't. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:55:37
You bought 9000 BTC, but weren't PC literate? That seems kind of fishy 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:55:57
Besides maybe himself when he ran for the Republican nomination for President.... 
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:34:48
Probably one of the new SR alternatives. Doubt there are neighborhood weed dealers accepting Bitcoins as payment, although you're right they would be pretty smart to do that.
