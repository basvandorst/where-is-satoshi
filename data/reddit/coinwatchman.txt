Are you implying that Coinbase insures your money?  Against what and up to what limits, and what are the exceptions?  I think you will find in trying to answer these questions that your Coinbase balances are hardly insured at all.

So, what does FDIC insurance cover?  In what cases does FDIC pay out?  Does it pay out if Coinbase is hacked or only if Coinbase's bank where the USD funds are kept goes bankrupt?  What happens if money is stolen without compromising the hot wallet?  You don't need to hack the hot wallet to steal funds by arbitrarily modifying balances, faking deposits, duplicating withdrawals, exploiting trading engine bugs.

Exactly. What happened to voting with your feet/dollars? Want to use an exchange that supports SegWit, do it.  In voting for the laggards, you are telling the early adopters that there is nothing they can do to win you as a client.  What incentive will they have to be early next time?  There are plenty of SegWit-supporting alternatives to choose from:

Every exchange with a bank account has the same coverage as Coinbase but most are too honest to attempt to manipulate your perception of what is actually covered.  And to your earlier point about attention to detail, I leave you this:

Don't buy this garbage fake solution. Questions:
1. When will they transition out? Now or 10 years later?
2. Where will they transition to? A wholly owned subsidiary where they will be developing software for 1 client: Coinbase?
3. Why are you blaming it on your Corporate Development team's diligence process now? You said before that you had already considered the team history in your diligence process but it didn't matter because "technology". So, were you lying then or are you lying now? Even Kraken managed to identify the problematic reputations of the founders just through basic vendor evaluation. That you would miss it in your acquisition diligence is not believable (especially after you admitted that you had considered it).
4. Why do you say "despite the fact that they have no current affiliation with Hacking Team"? This is like saying "despite the fact that they have no current affiliation with Nazi genocide". You think it shouldn't matter and it didn't matter to you but because people are unreasonable in their expectations, you are forced to make a fake apology?
5. What about our data that was sold? Why no mention of this? How about answers to these questions? [
6. Why are you still feeding us this line about Neutrino's technology? Others have said it's weak compared to the other options out there.
7. Did you actually buy Neutrino for the government contacts or was it for their abilities to deanonymize even the most careful journalists? What is truly so special about Neutrino that you're not saying? Or, did they have something on you and you were forced to pay?
8. Is Coinbase still lobbying for heavy regulation? [
9. Why did Coinbase violate its own listing policy and list XRP?
10. Why don't you just take some accountability and say that you hired these guys because they're the best fit for the future Coinbase wants: heavy regulation with insider deals with the government which you will feed dissidents to?
Zero accountability from coinbase and more lies.  Coinbase needs to back out completely, trash the technology, which is probably riddled with back doors) and apologize to everyone.  These people need to be fired today, not at some mysterious point in the future after you've used them up.  Commit to some deadlines and you might earn back some trust.  This never would have happened if Coinbase actually cared about people. It's a profit machine and nothing more.  You're only sorry that you got caught.

Coinbase is convenient as an onramp. You have many superior options for offramps and trading.

Translation: sorry, not sorry.
You have to wonder what other atrocities Coinbase will justify to meet its objectives. When a company shows you that they care more about money than morals, you should believe them. Don't be surprised if it's your well-being that they trade to meet their objectives next time.

Letter of intent is not binding but if Brock thought he bought Gox 5 years ago, where has he been all this time?  
What is the point of reviving the Gox brand? When the trustee auctions the domain, Brock can buy it and launch his exchange. I don't see a reason to combine payouts with launching a new exchange.  
In creditor rehabilitation, creditors already get 100% with Mark and shareholders getting nothing. The best outcome for creditors is to get their money back ASAP with minimal complications and minimal interference. If they want to invest in another exchange after they get their money back, they can do it then.  
I hope that Brock does not become Peter Vessenes

It would be unusual for a company to speak about an ongoing case. Anyone can make false accusations. Some of these claims are so ridiculous, it casts doubt on the more serious ones. The bathroom thing, the relationship structuring to dodge SEC rules thing. There are many reasons why balances would not reconcile 100% all the time, such as when wire transfers are in flight between banks. Once Kraken files their response with the court, we'll have their side of the story.

I think that we have to take anything a "whistleblower" says only after they were fired with a grain of salt. He does not claim to have informed anyone else in the company of his findings. Why didn't he say something to the CEO, board, investors, other employees? If he was fired for being incompetent, it makes sense that he would have misunderstandings about the business operations. It just seems unlikely that this one guy, who said nothing until now, would be right where everybody else in the company is wrong.
My understanding of the address use is that certain employees were required to produce personal addresses as signers on certain accounts or directors of certain entities. I don't see anything wrong on the surface with one employee renting a room from another employee. There are huge risks for directors of crypto companies to expose their home addresses.
I didn't see any allegation that there was an unqualified executive. The "owner's gf" has been with the company since 2014. Since then, the company's valuation has increased 200x. Whatever is happening there seems to be working.

Lawyers usually take employment cases on a contingency. The strategy is to throw everything at the wall, tax the defendant through costly court proceedings and hope to be paid a settlement to go away before you lose. You don't need to have a single valid claim for this strategy to be effective. In the US, this "blackmail" through the court system is completely legal. You can tell it's a shakedown because most of the claims made have nothing to do with wrongful termination.
