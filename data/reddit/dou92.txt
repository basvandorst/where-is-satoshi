If you do not value housing, education and hard work than what do you value? Of course there is going to be a high cost for these things, and debt is an efficient way to maintain the value. 
What is the alternative? Go back to a society where everyone fends for themselves? Farms for themselves, teaches themselves, and builds their own houses? Sure, let's go back to living like the Native Americans and die at the age of 30, that sounds like freedom to me. 
Society today is great because everyone can excel at what they are skillful at yet still benefits from other people's skill sets. Debt is necessary for this system to work. Calling it slavery is ignorant.

I appreciate the links. I'm trying my best to make heads or tails of this information, and to be honest I'm lost, and I know there are many people out there just like me. 
This is a big problem I have with bitcoin. It is very complicated stuff, there seems to be a lot of existing/potential issues, yet there is no insurance policy, there is no one I can go to for answers when something goes wrong. People have trouble trusting something they can't understand. 
That's not to say I understand how the banking system works entirely, but it is certainly reassuring that I can always go to Bank of America, sit down with a cleric and seek help if anything ever goes wrong with my account. And if shit completely hits the fan, we have a government backing the banks.

I would say less than 1 percent of users have read and understand the code. Very few users seem to know how to even access the code. Yet every bitcoin user boasts about how the code is masterfully written, claim it is perfectly secure, and decentralized. These claims cannot be made with certainty unless you are a programmer and understand the code. So many bitcoin users claim they don't trust banks or the government, but for some reason they trust whoever is programming bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:37:51
Listen I know a guy who knows a guy just like the next guy. 
The code seems to be getting more and more complicated and convoluted with every hurdle it faces. With every fork and every patch fewer and fewer coders actually understand it. Meaning fewer and fewer people actually control the future of bitcoin. I don't want my life savings to be tied up in some experimental code that is constantly undergoing scaling issues.

Please explain how BTC is going to solve all our problems. What is going to stop banks, the institutions that control nearly all of our fiat money, from taking control of BTC. Banks can control and manipulate with bitcoin the same way they do with fiat currency. What 'protocol' written into the BTC code is going to stop banks from doing all the fucked up shit you claim they have been doing? How would BTC have prevented the '08 housing crisis? How is BTC going to stop the banks from hiking up loan intrest rates? How is BTC going to stop the rising costs of healthcare and education? Everyone acts like BTC is the ultiumate solution, but no one goes into the gritty details on how its will actually solve our problems.

The only potential, non-speculative value of bitcoin is if it becomes a viable form of currency. Gold and stocks have value outside of this. Stocks are backed by a company that has a valuable product or provides a valuable service. Gold has value in electronics and technology. Your ignorance is criminal. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:16:35
As the economy and population grows the demand for money increases. As more goods are being produced, there must be more money produced to buy these goods. If the government did not produce new money it would stagnate the economies growth. As long as there is an equilibrium between supply and demand inflation will not get out of hand. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:56:26
But gold is shiny and makes flashy jewelry, which amazingly enough adds value to it. Let me know when I can turn some bitcoins into jewelry and I'll invest in some. 
The only other value I can see in bitcoin is that there is a finite amount, similar to gold. I just took a poop that is one of a kind, I'm thinking about calling it a currency and selling it online - maybe I can get 20,000 dollars for it. 
The blockchain is a great, but you can't use bitcoins blockchain for anything else other than for transaction purposes. I can definitely see the blockchain technology being applied to other cases, but that doesn't increase the value of bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:21:40
How will the blockchain revolutionize how we use money? How will it solve the current financial problems that we are facing?
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:57:19
The HUGE difference is no one want to share money, but people are very open to sharing ideas and data. 
The biggest problem with currency is the inherent greed that is associated with it. Bitcoin does not, and cannot stop people from being greedy. Banks can be greedy with bitcoin the same way they are greedy with fiat currency. The bitcoin block chain will verify any transaction, the block chain doesn't care if that transaction took place because someone was wielding a gun and demanded it. Once you find a currency that eliminates greed let me know, that would be a true revolution in currency. Bitcoin is not. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:18:15
Yes! I love this! The fact that bitcoin is taxed as an investment makes it worthless. This makes it impossible to become a viable form of currency, making bitcoin essentially worthless.

Is moving money a big problem for you? It's not really a problem for me.

I'm happy to pay a middle man who provides a valuable service to me. No matter how you cut it it takes time and energy to process transactions. I'd rather pay a service like PayPal or a bank rather than depend on bitcoin, which also has fees, and eats up an absolutely ridiculous amount of energy. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:11:23
No matter how you cut it someone is getting paid for processing transactions. A banker/ payment service company or a bitcoin miner. They both use large amounts of energy. The amount of energy used for bitcoin, however, seems a bit unwarranted when you consider the number of bitcoin owners that actually use it for its purpose - a form of currency; it seems like a waste. 
Our entire economy depends on banks, and bitcoin cannot replace them. Say bitcoin did become the main form of currency, we would still need to trust banks for housing loans, car loans, business loans and investments. Currency is based on trust in people. We cannot put all of our trust into a computer algorithm and claim all of our problems are solved. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:59:15
Humans are necessary to run bitcoin mining facilities. 
You seemed to completely ignore a critical fact I brought up. We need banks for housing loans, car loans, business loans and investments. 
"Banks can be replaced by bitcoin" - paraphrasing some naive and ignorant Reddit user 2018 
The only way currency works is if humanity can agree on how much it is worth. In order to form an agreement, trust is needed. Clearly we cannot agree on the value of bitcoin, hence its volatility, and therefore there is a lack of trust. Secure banks, government, a legal system, and unity are the foundations of trust. The fact that bitcoin was built on anarchy and anti- establishment is proving to be a massive problem. 
A secure encrypted ledger is great, I'm all for it. But it only scratches the surface as a solution to our economic struggles and inequality. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:04:41
God, I hate this analogy. How can you compare a World Wide Web that connects the entire world to an electronic encrypted ledger. Data and currency have little to no similarities. 
Saying bitcoin is like the internet is exactly what I am referring to in my original comment- claiming it's absolutely revolutionary but not going into detail as to why it is revolutionary, it's all hype. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:11:05
Where are you getting this information? Who coded segwit? Is it open sourced? Where can I go to see this code?

God this is such an ignorant statement. It doesn't matter if a merchant will accept your currency? OF COURSE IT DOES. At what point does it matter? Never? Then what are you investing in? A novelty item?

I consider myself a pretty average American, so there are a whole lot of people in the same boat as me. If you're concerned about people in socialist countries like Venezuela, I appreciate your empathy, but I'm not going convert my money into a highly volatile, speculative currency just to accommodate their needs. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:47:44
I ask for a source and get called a troll. Are you kidding me? I understand the theory behind bitcoin perfectly and have read as many blogs as the next guy. There should be more people like me trying to actually understand all of these patches, there should also be more people willing to share their knowledge, especially when the post has a title like this one. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:35:59
Except the bitcoin ledger is anonymous so it makes it even harder to track where the money is going and who owns what... which is why drug dealers love it (use to love it before the transaction fees got out of hand). I also don't consider my money secure if I have to store my life savings on a flash drive and hide it under my bed. 
Great, that is one example bitcoin helped out with financial injustices. How will it help with the rising price of Heath care and education. How will it help with the increase in inequality? How will it solve the rising interest rates on loans? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:51:24
The name of the original thread is understanding segwit, so I assumed some questions would be acceptable. 
I'm simply asking for a specific source of some data and you harass me with this wise ass response.  Everyone on this god damn subreddit is so defensive.  
It is important that everyone on this subreddit has this information, and from what it sounds like, half of the people on here just consider any code associated with bitcoin to be a magic spell. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:43:31
Share price is not a good metric for this. The companies market cap is a more accurate measure.

Wait...you don't think bitcoin is a usable medium of exchange? The only reason it could possibly have any value is for that exact reason. It serves no other purpose other than being a potential form of currency. It is not like gold which has uses in technology and jewelry. 
If you don't see bitcoin as a viable currency then you're right it doesn't involve trust. But, if it were to be used as a currency, which is its intended purpose, then it would. A currency is a medium of exchange, any exchange / trade involves trust and honor. The value of a currency also involves trust and honor; we need to trust each other in order to agree on the value of a currency, we need to trust that there wont be sudden riots that cause the value of the currency to tank i.e. Venezuela. Bitcoin is not immune to this. 
Peaceful protests go a long long way. I can name three peaceful protests I witnessed in the past few years involving large companies and their unhappy workers - National grid, Stop and Shop, and Marriot. In all three cases it proved how much power the workers have, they refused to work because they wanted better benefits and wages, and guess what, in all three cases they succeeded. 
You can keep investing in bitcoin. That will definitely help the single mom working 3 jobs to get by. Oh wait no it wont, it will just help you turn your disposable income in to, hopefully, more USD. It's funny how you think your bitcoin is more valuable the more USD its worth, yet simultaneously think USD is trash.  
If you want to make a difference, bitcoin is not the solution.

I don't want a link I want you to tell me. I'm sick of the circle jerking in this community. "Listen to THIS guy, he has allllll the answers! He's really smart!"
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:24:18
Not sure what kind of government corruption you keep referencing? Please give some examples. Some government corruption I see is when a political figure makes decisions based on what company is paying them the most. In a capitalist country like the United states private / public companies and the government, are unfortunately, tied together, so protesting against companies in turn has an affect on the government. Also, banks are affected by these protests too - the more money that big corporations dish out, the less they control.
Banks hold people accountable for how they use their money. I think this is a good thing. Bitcoin is completely anonymous and would lead to further corruption due to the fact that it is impossible to put a name to any transaction. 
You have this over arching tone that big banks and government are evil. Yet, you give very few examples as to why they are evil and how bitcoin will stop them from these evil doings. So far it seems like you are upset with inflation, and the fact that they try to stop money laundering... what else?

I am genuinely searching for bitcoins potential, but can't seem to find it no matter what I read or who I talk to. Often times my discussions degrade into debates with people who must've lost a lot of money on their investment yet continue to hold and deny logic.

The difference is I believe my investments are making the world a better place in very specific aspects i.e green energy investments are helping global warming. You, and a lot of others on here, act like bitcoin is the almighty investment that will rid the world of crooked politicians and bankers and deliver you to financial freedom. 
My expectations are very reasonable and pin pointed. Your expectations are far fetched and over generalized.

We will still need credit creation if bitcoin takes over. We will still need loans.
@_date: 2019-05-19 12:29:42
Back to my original point. Not much will change if bitcoin magically takes over. Financial burdens will still be a thing.

Just let go dude. Bitcoin is not the solution.
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:32:22
Who sets the interest rates? Who enforces it? People act like crypto will free us from all financial struggles. We still need to play the same game we're playing except robots will control the game if crypto takes over. I'd rather have humans controlling the system.

I agree, security and tracking has gotten out of control. But banks tracking my purchases is the least of my worries and I have personally never had a bank prevent a purchase I wanted to make. I have a bigger problem with my phone listening to my conversations and tracking my search history and location. Or the fact that I need to take my shoes off to get on a plane. But, that is a whole different debate and has nothing to do with bitcoin. 
I agree with a lot of the issues you have with the government. Unfortunately, bitcoin will not solve a lot of the problems you have. Bitcoin will make it easier for politicians to get bought out due to its anonymity. Governments can still be all about the bitcoin. They can still kill innocent citizens. Bitcoin will eventually inhibit inflation hindering economic growth. The 2008 recession was due to leveraging housing loans and could still happen if bitcoin was around. 
Listen, I get it. A lot of shit about our government sucks. Back to my original point, evil and greed will always be around and bitcoin cannot prevent it. But please stop acting like hodl, and to the moon memes are gonna solve any of these problems. Start a revolution if you're so passionate about these issues, don't just hodl.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:46:30
I do not think investing in bitcoin is a good way to push back against greed, inequality and corruption. The foundation of an any currency is trust and honor. Investing in bitcoin as a form of rebellion will not solve our problems, it will only cause a divide and distrust. A peaceful protest would be a better solution. 
There is nothing in bitcoin's code that allows for peer to peer loans. An additional program would be required for that. And the interest rates would need to be set with an agreed upon standard just like they are with the USD. 
Inflation should be maintained at 2 percent in order to encourage economic growth. The "garbage inflation-ridden USD" has been at a steady 2 percent for the past 10 years. It is easy to find a safe investment that will beat 2 percent i.e. Government issued bonds. Bitcoins inflations rate will go under 2 percent after the next halving and eventually to zero, which will completely halt economic growth.
Thanks for not giving a shit about my problems.

There will still be greed and inequality. There will still be powerful rich banks and companies controlling bitcoin. You'll still have that college loan and mortgage hanging over your head with an unfair interest rate. Bitcoin doesn't solve any of the biggest problems I have.

Do you think banks will just disappear if bitcoin takes over? Where will I go for a loan? Some dude in the alley way? Or are we just going to buy houses with straight bitcoin up front? All the same problems we face with USD will be around if bitcoin magically takes over. Probably even worse.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:42:59
I appreciate your efforts to persuade me. I hope I am wrong and bitcoin makes the world a better place.
