Why would I use digital currency if I can't even keep it on my computer?

Great example of your average bitcoin enthusiast here.

My banks have 0 fees, and all they know is that money goes into them and goes out to pay credit card statements, a rent check, and deposits to Vanguard. They also reimburse all ATM fees if I ever need to withdraw cash. I have literally never paid a cent to either of my banks.
My credit cards get me 1-5% off everything I buy n the form of cash back. In the last year through normal spending I've gotten over $650 in cash back. I have never paid a cent in fees of interest on any of my cards. And my cards are an extra layer of consumer protection that I have used to get $60 back from a retailer that otherwise would not have refunded a botched sale.
That's all worth it to me if my credit card or bank knows what I spend my money on- it's groceries, bike parts, and board games. When my wife buys pot she just gets cash and goes to the legal recreational seller. 
I understand that bitcoin has it's uses, but for non-tech geniuses like me I would never tie up any funds in it since it is so difficult to secure and so easy to have stolen. I used to want to buy some as a fun speculation, but stories like this and the previous teamviewer theft have completely turned me off from even that.

Serious question, why are bitcoin enthusiasts so terrible at picking banks and credit unions? I have two banks and neither charges me any fees, they even reimburse me all ATM fees.

Yea try Ally or USAA.

How come a captain of industry such as yourself thinks $8000 is a lot of money?
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:31:30
That was obviously a joke mocking gullible conspiracy minded people like you.

Yes. Even my emergency fund is accessible to me since it is in a money market account linked to a debit card.

Wow what a professional image, great way to advertise bitcoin.

That's over 6% annualized return...  If this were a legitimate venture that would be huge interest.
