If you believe Bitcoin is superior and more legitimate than USD then I truly worry for your financial future.

Will be downvoted, but I've seen similar rationalizations before. You did something risky and lost money. Don't try to assign a false "meaning" that you did something noble and self-sacrificing for humanity. That is exactly the wrong lesson here.

Using terms like "fiat currency" makes it seem that USD is somehow illegitimate and thus inferior to a legitimate currency. Nothing could be further from the truth.

85% of the world isn't really their target demographic.

Oh my, that's so clever. Just, wow.

I misinterpreted Bitcoin as Paypal and thought "Oh shit, Apple is fucked due to the network effect."  Thanks for your inadvertent clarity. Bitcoin is virtual and not widely accepted. Also, while iPhone users are a small percentage of total phone users, they are the 1% throwing around serious money, making this very relevant.

People throw "fiat currency" around on like it's an insult. You're correct of course, most money is fiat but the connotation is often negative and (usually) unnecessary to state. I think you made a good point.

I know it was a typo, but you described the situation perfectly. Downvote away.
