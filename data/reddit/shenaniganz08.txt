not really, from my experience the friends who invested in bitcoin also have other investments. The rich get richer

I bought at 1k, sold at 10k, invested that money and have made about a 20% return with less fluctuation
So yeah I'm pretty glad I sold

i was tempted to buy at 3k, but it never got there (lowest was 3.1k). 
If it ever gets back to 4-5k I plan on buying.

I tried taking a screenshot on coinbase when it was 19K. I had the transaction ready to go on coinbase
I canceled at the last moment, and literally a few minutes later it tanked down to 15K

29yo Doctor here

I bought at 1k and then I got out the last time it hit 10k.  People buying at 15k thought I was dumb for selling that low.
I was going to purchase when it hit 3k again but that never happened. Kicking myself for not buying at $3,100.  To think that I could have tripled my money by now if it would have dropped just a tiny bit more.

anyone know the cause or reason for this 15% surge ?

Bought at 1k, sold at 10k
People were calling me a fool so I reluctantly bought back 6k at around 15k. Was tempted to sell at 19k but told myself I would hold until 20k. At around 6.5k I said, fuck it I'm out.  Walked away with my original 1k, 3k from the original gain and 2k from the final sell off 
Things could have been worse, but The biggest mistake was not trusting my gut instinct

No fuck you OP for being an idiot and not doing your research first 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:46:00
Hahaha Fuck that
I made less than 200 trades and less than $20k in capital gains, I'm not reporting a damn thing when there is zero paper trail

My 60 year old dad is a law abiding citizen. Two years ago he was audited by the IRS.  He told me it was one of the worst experiences of his life. 
This is like saying there is a 0.59% chance that you will come down with cancer.  Trust me you don't want to be audited.

Would  I need to convert my current Bitcoins ?

I panicked sold, and then bought back in 
Other than the fees I didn't mess up too bad

I'm not a true believer but I'm holding because I sold at 9K to cut my losses  and bought back at 8K thinking I was doing the smart thing.
