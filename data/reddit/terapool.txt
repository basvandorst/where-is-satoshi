True. I have double checked it.
@_date: 2011-06-26 09:09:11
Where are you headed?
@_date: 2011-06-23 21:50:20
Yes looks like they haven't forced you to enter an email address, but that is what it's asking for.
@_date: 2011-06-28 04:02:48
The current difficulty is *proof* that people are willing to pay $180 for a 5850!
@_date: 2011-06-29 23:47:20
Thank god.
I thought you were asking for advice on how to change the circuit breakers in your wall in order to increase the wattage of your mining rigs or something... and reddit was down for quite a while! If you did you could have burnt your house down :S
@_date: 2011-06-27 05:56:26
Perhaps you should change your username and/or email address used at MtGox?
I wouldn't be surprised if you keep getting a lot of these types of shenanigans related to your disclosed username and email info over the next few months.
@_date: 2011-06-29 09:20:30
If they are still around in 25+ years I will use them.
Remember that nobody trusted banks back in the day either when a new one was popping up every week.
Site looks professional however, it's always nice to see a new addition to the Bitcoin community.

Small miners would actually benefit from a smaller pool.
When you only submit 1 share out of 100,000 for a deepbit block that gets solved in a few minutes well.... 0.000001 BTC times a million is still a very small amount.
At least if you go with btcmine and the time to find a block takes hours... then you will get paid proportionately to the amount of work you did.
Where as with deepbit.. a large miner (who is only 10 times your size in terms of hashing power) may submit 100 times the number of shares you do because of luck.
@_date: 2011-07-03 02:55:35
Quite interested! Great looking work so far!
@_date: 2011-06-27 05:39:02
Apparrently MagicalTux (the creator of MtGox) talks on the irc chat quite regularly.
@_date: 2011-06-29 09:21:50
GPUs happened.
@_date: 2011-07-03 22:25:28
They should invest in a "down for maintenance" banner at least.
Can you imagine if people couldn't log into their bank accounts? They would go ape shit.
@_date: 2011-07-03 12:12:30
Simply checking "received BTC" is not enough.
I could easily send 1 BTC to myself 25,000 times through another address and make it look as though I had received 25,000 BTC.

Don't know why you are getting downvoted into the nethers for this one.
The quality of the podcast is quite good in both content and sound quality. Nice back and forth banter. It sounds quite professional except for some high pitched noise on one of the Mics. Maybe it's just my speakers?
People, we need more stuff like this. Let's not argue over who made it, please?
@_date: 2011-06-30 01:41:40
No offense but you ***work for them*** and you don't know what website you guys use?


According to whois.cira.ca ... cavirtex.ca isn't even registered. (You might want to get on that one, like tonight, as you first order of business. Because tomorrow I am purchasing it and putting up goatse.cx mirrors ... or redirecting everybody to my tradehill referral, haven't made up my mind yet ;)
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:12:17
I phone cavirtex the other day and they seemed confident that they would begin accepting deposits again soon.
@_date: 2011-06-27 05:54:36
when I visit site "the connection is untrusted!" ahhhhhh!
Pay the $2 for an SSL certificate (or do it properly).
Nobody wants to play poker for money on an "untrusted" website!
@_date: 2011-07-04 07:37:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2011-07-24 00:43:16
You're talking 10 cents there... on a currency that has been known to move more than $5 per day.
@_date: 2011-06-26 07:26:01
Tradehill has been increasing in volume for the previous 3 days so far as I can tell.
@_date: 2011-06-28 01:51:14
So long as we put ourselves on their radar, that is the best we can hope for right now I am afraid.
@_date: 2011-06-29 09:19:27
That would only be possible if they are investing that money for you.
@_date: 2011-06-28 21:02:17
Only problem is... your average joe thinks that a "High Yield Investment Program" sounds like a good thing.
@_date: 2011-07-03 22:21:30
Should have used namecoin :P
@_date: 2011-07-12 15:48:47
Not so far as I know, unfortunately. It's a great idea to suggest to the reddit.com coders, however.
@_date: 2011-07-04 10:28:22
If you have read any of the drivel they've been writing lately, you'd understand.
@_date: 2011-06-30 07:14:56
Right, but it is a must that you guys purchase that domain name. When people hear of the "canadian" exchange they are going to think .ca for the same reason you just did.
Do you know what a goatse.cx mirror is? ;)
@_date: 2011-06-29 06:06:51
You are setting yourself up too perfectly there.
I hope you realize this is reddit.
Anybody got a quick pun?! I'm too tired.

How do you figure?
You enter your email address, and it tells you if anyone has tried to compromise your email address.
They could theoretically imagine your email address if you used gmail or hotmail for example... I don't see how you are risking your bitcoins by giving someone your email address?
@_date: 2011-06-24 03:32:19
Never thought about that one. perhaps they did lose a bunch of BTC and will simply deny 10% of customers or something like that.
What to believe?
@_date: 2011-06-29 06:14:05
Good idea. In fact everybody should.
@_date: 2011-06-28 01:48:46
Why wouldn't he at least sell it and re-invest the sales into the bitcoin economy? Instead of shutting it down.
As far as I know, many people enjoyed using this service, however "imperfect" it was. What a shame.

In fact, mining 24/7 will probably help your card last longer than if you only used it for casual gaming.

As you can see, alexa's "reach" data for bitcoin.org has cut itself almost in half since the June 19th MtGox fiasco.

I have no idea how they do it, I found it through HN just now but it seems to work quite well!

You forgot "sexy".
Bookmarked and is also now my homepage. Good work.
@_date: 2011-06-29 06:10:27
Also enforce the fact that the low price is a must. Their solution should not be to simply raise prices. We don't want that.
