Sadly I use an iPhone nowadays, and Apple doesn't like Bitcoin apps on it.

So a while back I came into some money - my grandmother left me a pile of it.
I could have bought a hot car or something; I could have done all the "I just won the lottery!" kinds of things. Instead? Instead I invested a lot of it. A lot of it's still in CDs that'll mature over the next few years anyway; blowing all of it on a Ferrarri would take work.
And I've been spending a few years trying to get my comics career to the point where it can pay a decent chunk of my rent most months. I'm pursuing my passion, you know? Right now it's to the point where I can usually go to an out-of-state convention and break even. I'm not scrambling to find work, I'm not stuck in a room-mate situation I don't like. I live alone in a not-terribly-expensive apartment in a decent part of town. I've got a few years of runway left before I have to either turn a profit on this "comics" thing or find a "real job".
(I also really, really need to set things up so people can buy my comics online with bitcoin.)
But yeah. Just sit on it for a while. Maybe turn some of it into dollars, sure. Especially if you're one of those folks who bought several thousand BTC back when they were worthless. Man I wish I was one of you.
And consider reading stuff like Learn to think about what you really want to spend your money on doing, not on endless consumer distractions. If you're a bitzillionaire, you now have a chance to get off the treadmill of long work hours, hellish commutes, and buying stuff to distract yourself from the misery caused by those two things. What would you do with your life if "paying the bills" stopped being a concern?

Is there any reason for me - or anyone else dabbling in BTC - to want to run a full node?

Look, sometimes you just want to have a hoard and sit on it. It does great things for your peace of mind. Ask any dragon.

Two days? What wallet are you using? I'm a noob who's been using [MultiBit]( and it synched in like maybe five minutes the first time I ran it.

I have the luxury of having discretionary income to spend on something that may never return any kind of profit. n.n

Right now I've got [a Bigcartel store]( I'm kinda thinking of moving it over to Shopify since they've added Bitcoin as an option next to Paypal.
It's either that or get an ecommerce system running on my own site and that kinda starts to sound like WORK. n.n

It's not so much "cashflow" as "bought some BTC before the price started spiking".
@_date: 2013-10-12 19:47:29
I bought like 5btc recently - mostly before the Silk Road crash, one during it. I'm sitting on them to see what happens. Next time I see a bitcoin crash, I'll probably buy more than just one.
When I go to comic conventions, I tell people I take cash, credit, or bitcoin. So far nobody's called my bluff on that last, which is good because I'm not entirely sure I have a good "pay me in bitcoin" workflow set up yet. One of these days I'll start selling my stuff online via bitcoin, as well, but that'll involve getting a general shop infrastructure up first.

Dude it is totally normal to stop watching animation once you get into the industry. I quit watching it when I started working on it, most of the people I know who've worked in animation say the same thing.
It's like eating sausage after you've started working in the factory. All you can see is what goes into it.

I bought some btc via Coinbase recently and they took a week to show up. That sure feels slow to me.

I unsubscribed from because it was making me think far too much about what my much smaller number of bitcoins will be worth someday. I have better things to do then plan out how to spend maybe-money.
well okay maybe i like fantasizing about buying a penthouse condo in a few years sometimes

So buy some fraction of a bitcoin now. Sit on it like you're a dragon on her hoard. Play the long game.
Because this is what happens when the world *starts* to notice bitcoin. And you'll be kicking yourself if it DOES become a Real Currency with 1BTC worth hundreds of thousands for the day you said "man I didn't invest in bitcoin two weeks ago, fuck this I'm giving up".

Hi, I'm 42 and I'm still kicking myself for not leaving a miner running in the background of my computer when I first heard about bitcoin a few years ago.
I finally bought a couple when they were around US$100.
@_date: 2013-09-08 01:44:11
Ah, cool.
It's still pretty damn slow until then, though.

why are all of the axes of these charts lacking labels. what am i looking at here. what is being graphed against what.
oh there is a tiny pale "wtf"  link in the upper right that brings in boxes with explanatory text. great design, guys. eminently readable.

I'm trying to figure out how to do just that.
I've got a wallet, I've got [a graphic novel with cryptography references in it]( I'd love to be able to sit behind a table at a convention and say "I take cash, credit, or Bitcoin". I'd love to be able to sell copies of it online for bitcoin as easily as I can sell it for credit cards or paypal by setting up a store on bigcartel.
But I can't spare the time to dig through fifty half-baked solutions to find a fully-baked one. I'm too busy drawing the comic and going to cons and setting up Kickstarter campaigns.
Or more rudely: shut up and make it easier for me to take your bitcoin.
edit. I fucked around and went down a bunch of blind alleys, and discovered that Coinbase has a nice, simple "request money" feature on their website that I can use to either generate a QR code for a particular amount of BTC or USD, or send an email request for the same to an arbitrary address. We'll see how that works at Rose City Comic-Con, if anyone bites. I'll work on taking BTC for online orders at some future date.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:20:49
wooo holy fucking shit I am so glad i looked at this thread. I just bought a few whole BTC for what is probably the last time in my life.
Now to sit on those coins like a dragon on a hoard.
