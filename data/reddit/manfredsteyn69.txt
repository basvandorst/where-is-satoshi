He has definitely backtracked from his position in November when he was much more bullish on Bitcoin specifically.
@_date: 2014-02-05 22:04:23
True. If nothing else, you learn to be patient with BTC!
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:57:54
Oh thank God this advice monkey has weighed in against Bitcoin!!! This means it has every chance of success.

It has just grown something like 30% in one week, which  was way too fast, even for Bitcoin. Historically growth has averaged about 0.7% a day. So this is likely a correction.
Bitcoin seems to grow in the following way: super boom where it grows like crazy, correction down by about 50% of its recent boom, then a period of stability where it goes +/- 10% or so for a few days, then the next boom.
I'm finally learning to just grab the popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.

Is this a case of "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer"? Seems to me that Wells Fargo and the rest of the banking cabal stand to lose a lot of their profits to Bitcoin over the long run. Why would they embrace it?

Absolutely. The price is so much about speculation in these relatively early days, so its nice to see it justified with a rapid merchant adoption rate.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:49:57
That might be a world record for tipping distance.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:58:45
The historical trend suggest $6,000-$10,000 by end of year, although its hard to picture that in this long run of stability.

Good report! I wonder why Canada features so prominently given its small economy and backwards populace?
@_date: 2014-02-05 22:11:25
The historical growth rate has been about 0.69% per day. This exponential growth curve has done an amazing job of accounting for growth so far (with the exception of the recent China gong show). We are actually still priced significantly higher than the historic trend, which likely accounts for some of the no-growth pattern over the past month. 
The guys over on  are probably as insightful as any consultancy firms, although posts there are primarily people who upload their predictive graphs and then other people dryly criticizing them.

You could have made a fortune over the years just doing the opposite of this blowhard.

Thanks for the interesting article.
Every day that I have followed Bitcoin, I have developed a growing appreciation for the freedom that I enjoy living outside of a dictatorship.

Bitcoin will never exceed $15 billion because of some limitations in its algorithms? How frigging inaccurate and lazy can Newsweek get?
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:26:24
This makes Bitcoin look like a cult, which is alienating. 
Like it or not, we need the Soccer Moms of the world to grow to accept if it ever has a hope to go prime time.

You are doing a fantastic job. And I don't think you look evil at all, just over-worked and in need of a vacation.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:36:56
$6,000 based on the continued exponential growth rate of 0.69% increase a day. just a guess!
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:06:35
I'm Canadian. I used these guys to buy bitcoin: 
You have to register with them first, including taking a photo of your driver's license and a recent bill (from Rogers, Shaw etc.) that shows your current address. Once you're registered you can deposit to your account by going to any Bank of Montreal branch. They explain the process on the web site.
Once you've bought bitcoin its really easy to send it to your blockchain wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:18:20
While your numbers are suspect at best, I entirely agree that television is still paramount in spreading the bitcoin gospel. Overstock's inclusion of " now accepting bitcoin" at the end of their commercials legitimizes this exciting new system among the slack-jawed masses more effectively than any written word, regardless of whether those words are ink or digital.

Downvoted. Sorry but there has to be room for discussion and dissent or what's the point?

Big Money, Big Money! (why do i hear that in my head as having a Cantonese accent?).
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:57:58
Interesting. The number of retailers is growing by 0.89% a day on average since January 1st, which is faster than bitcoin's historical growth of 0.69% a day. That bodes well for the future!

Ask him to wrap his mind around an emerging financial system that doesn't need a bail out, and isn't built on a corrupt partnership between the banks and government favouring only the top 1%.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:34:22
Heh! I'm just putting it up their for "discussion" purposes. Who knows for sure where it goes next, but 2014 should be an interesting year, one way or the other!
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:31:38
I'm not suggesting R^2 is measuring predictive value. Just extrapolating out historical growth pattern forwards to see where the current trend would take us. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:04:41
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:40:05
Because Bitcoin is wildly unpredictable in the near-term and full of speculative froth which may very well not conveniently disappear before early February when its current pricing would be aligned with the curve.
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:49:25
 not sure why it didnt work
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:30:23
Yes that's right.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:35:16
I believe I did.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:36:59
We'll hit the top of the S-curve at some point, but, hey, it shows that its actually probably over-valued right now, even when using an admittedly optimistic trend line.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:34:10
Ha ha! Probably not, but I just found it interesting and was hoping to get a conversation going. Glad it got the response it did.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:17:07
Its not randomly drawing; its fitting the simplest curve to the historical data and extrapolating that curve into the future. The growth curve to date has been a result of the various actors and events you mention, and presumably they would continue to fuel the growth trend in the future. But the trend projection is not trying to capture seminal events will occur or their impact.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:38:03
Your graph, as aesthetically pleasing at it is, doesn't fit the historical data as well!
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:38:42
Not yet, it ain't Friday night in my time zone yet. Check back later.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:40:08
Yes, right now it is over-valued according to the trend line. I'm not selling though!
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:23:34
Its a projection based on historic data, so it is what it is. Bitcoin is wildly unpredictable so I wouldn't bet on the speculative froth disappearing before February either. I think buying and holding is the only sane thing to do in these critical, volatile weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:08:05
For what its worth, i had never shopped there until they announced future bitcoin adoption. Now i''ve already bought a coat there and am eyeing a laptop there too. So, yes, it probably helps them gain new markets. It certainly won my loyalty.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:32:07
No, its in orders of magnitude. So Y=1 = 10, Y=2=100, Y=3=1000, Y=4=10000 etc.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:18:55
Historic growth data that underwent log10 conversion and then extrapolated out on a simple best-fitting polynomial. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:39:22
Apologies for trying to get a conversation started.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:27:29
The exponential curve didn't capture the historic pattern as accurately (R^2 of 0.73) and sadly only forecast Bitcoin at around $100,000 by the end of next year!
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:39:12
I'm not an economist...that's why I might be worth listening to.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:36:34
You can download the data at the bottom of this page: 
I understand what you're saying about arbitrary choice of curves, but this simple quadratic equation best summed up historical data with the minimum complexity (think Occam's Razor). 
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:12:39
Its a trend line that extends the generally positive growth in the historical data into the future. So it doesn't account for the inevitable noise along the way.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:55:38
By far the best response! Although the equation seems to have predicted this recent drop...
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:41:20
It fits the historic data quite well. What's wrong with just seeing where the curve continues for a bit?
