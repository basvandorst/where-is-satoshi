What if he sells it now and then buys it again after sometime when the price goes lower?

Which one got hacked? I don't see any such news on the front page.

I *didn't* have the option to put a higher fee or I definitely *would* have. The current fee was 0.0005 BTC. :(

Guys come on. You just down voted this new post. I know that there is some mechanism to retry it or there must be something that I could do about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:21:34
Thank you for saying that. I'm really glad to know that it is not the end. Invested in it for the first time. :(==

What should we do now? Sell or HODL? Someone please give me a reason for it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:57
But what about the 3 transactions per hour. You think they'll solve that also or what? :(

Where are you getting this data from? I don't see this mentioned anywhere.

How long did you have to hold again? And did you have the faith that it'll go back up again?

What's FUD?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:39:45
Is this going to be a hard fork?

My fee was higher. It was 0.0005 BTC. I didn't have an option to put a higher fees.

Nope. I said that my transaction fees were higher. I didn't say that my transaction was of the same value. I made a bigger transaction (although it was still only a fraction of a bitcoin). 
My point was that I paid a greater transaction fees than and still my transaction hasn't cleared.
