Are Redditors capably of arguing a point across without using false analogies? Let me point out that these are all large companies/oligopolies that are actively opposing those things. Comparing that with laypeople ridiculing Bitcoin is silly. 
America (yes, that evil country with all the rich people and an evil government that happens to be the financial and economic centre of the world) has not indicated an intention to ban Bitcoin. In fact, quite the opposite. Furthermore, very few industry groups have actively opposed Bitcoin. But don't let me stop you. Go ahead and assume they will all hate it and create for yourself a nice little persecution complex.
