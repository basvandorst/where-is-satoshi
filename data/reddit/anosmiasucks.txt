Thank you thank you thank you. I am so tired of this shit. I’m sorry I have only one upvote to give.

Thanks for the clarification. It actually makes it pretty funny knowing that

Jeez I swear I could fart and someone would say it’s the start of another bull run

I have no idea if this is an option or the best thing but when the day comes that I cash out, I’m transferring it to my brokerage account. Just seems that larger transfers are more common there and in fact I’ve had some substantial transfers into it.

That’s why anyone with a brain doesn’t pick stocks. Diversification and time is what wins out.

No dummy! Because some dude in *r/bitcoin* said so. Big difference /s

I *am* retired with 4 times that and live in one of the most expensive cities in one of the most expensive states.

Ooh the edge is so sharp here

It’s a tired joke at this point. From what I understand, some time ago someone posted about how you should *hold* bitcoin for the long term but he misspelled “hold” and instead, wrote “hodl”. It took off as a joke after that but for fucks sake it’s just lame.

This was the biggest laugh of my morning

Probably an ex employee of Backpage
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:18:23
This. In another comment from op, he said he threw “a ton” into btc back in December. WTF?
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:30:55
You forgot /s
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:33:40
I have no words for the utter stupidity I read in here sometimes but OP might top them all with this post
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:28:28
Stoned and losing money. Awesome!

You’re probably like me, you just read it for the yucks

Ahhh the old Reddit ageism rears it’s millennial head once again. I’m not a housewife but I am over 60 and hold a nice amount of btc in a Ledger Nano.  Some of us old fuckers do actually have working brain cells ya know.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:18:41
Yes and it’s a repost from like a week ago

This. I watched that clip and all I saw were women and I think a few men who looked like they were late 30’s/early 40’s

I honestly blew beer out of my nose I laughed so hard at this

Tom Draper LMFAO. The same moron who spent about 5 million to get an initiative on the ballot in California that would split it into 6 states and failed and is now shooting for an initiative to split it into 3 states.
