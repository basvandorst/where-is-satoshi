The 10% is not based on money put into the bank, but on the risk that the loan is judged to hold. The rules are called Basel I, Basel II &amp; Basel III.
Right now they try to implement Basel III which is a bit better but still a fraud. 
If you borrow for a house and the risk is 10% than the bank is required to have maybe 12% of 10% of the loan. Sometimes the banks it not required to have ANY % at all.
 Its based on a fraud. Borrowing out more gold than you have. Pretending to have the gold and its still a scam. 
Because the banks can give you a loan using your own money as reserve! The bank takes 0 risk themselves. They just charge you interest for making a promise of money they do not have (since its not 100% reserve) and thus, borrowing your own money to yourself! 
If they borrow you 100,000 and charge you 4% per year. They get 4000 per year from that interest. You get maybe 100, for having 5000 at the bank. 
The 5000 they use as reserve for your own loan.
If the ability to borrow out peoples own money to themselves to put them in debt without the bank taking any risk at all themselves (since they do not borrow out ANY money at all from themselves.) is not considered a fraud, than what is fraud?
With Bitcoin its not as simple to borrow peoples own Bitcoins to themselves. 
You need to actually own bitcoins to send them out.
Bitcoin is real digital money.

Bitcoin is not about "cashing out", sure cash out some of them, but keep as many as you can. 
The true value of Bitcoin is not what the current exchange rate is at. Its much bigger. Its freedom and less wars.
Its about using this new better currency and accepting it from others to help give it value. 
As a possibly better form of money, that you can send to whom you like on any place on this earth, when you like, for a extremely low cost. Its your freedom and your control.
 
Can you do that with the old system? No, they say its your money but you are limited to what rules others have made up and the old system really shows its true face when they start freezing accounts of those who have been involved in Bitcoin.
 
Understanding this you are on your way to understand the true value of bitcoin is freedom.
Its not about how much old cash money you have, there is an almost endless supply of it all over the world.
Its about how many Satoshi you have. One bitcoin is worth 100 million satoshi.

As it is today, the actual source of inflation is fractional reserve banking since that is the expansion of the money supply that really is circulating the economy. However behind this is QE. But QE in itselves do not create inflation.
