@_date: 2018-01-04 12:26:07
OK, imagine you're Satoshi. You have this this crazy but intriguing idea for a digital, borderless currency, that could even one day become a world currency. 
So, you dig up a magazine cover that came out 20 years earlier about a world currency, and delay launching your own product until that date. Because maybe one day someone clever on Reddit will dig it up and make the connection that you were making a world currency. Even though you were always completely up front that creating a world currency was your vision. 
Why would you go to such lengths? What would this prove? What - beyond the utterly banal - would it even mean?
It's pareidolia, pure and simple. Look at anything long enough and you'll start to see coincidences and patterns.

It is not required for a lightning node to lock up any funds in a payment channel. 
For a payment channel to be established, we only need to set up a multi-sig address between the hub and the user. There's no reason why all the funds can't come from the user, this would just mean the user would have to spend funds before they can receive any.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:44:03
Until it's online, we have no way of knowing. The key question will be how many lightning nodes are run: how competitive is this market. And the key question to this is, what are the barriers to running a lightning node. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:55:04
Sure, but I am not proposing that every single channel should be one way, merely that for many, many users this would be fine, meaning that this does not require BTC be locked up for every single channel. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:08:46
No, none do right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:02:23
I've explained this elsewhere already, but the node does not **need** to contribute any capital. For a payment channel to be established, we only need to set up a multi-sig address between the hub and the user. There's no reason why all the funds can't come from the user, this would just mean the user would have to spend funds before they can receive any.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:49:31
In the simulation a percentage has been used, however in the actual lightning network, my understanding is that the fee would be based on byte-size of the transaction, not monetary value (as on the main chain). So, essentially, a flat fee set by the node. 
Also, with barriers to entry and cost of running a lightning node being **very** low, I would expect that .01% is actually quite a high estimate for fee for a single hop. I could easily foresee a few satoshis per hop.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:17:25
Can we all just stop and appreciate how great it is to have a well-researched, carefully considered article like this written in a mainstream setting? 
Not so long ago, every article was just repeating the same bullshit about volatility, shadowy creator Nakomoto and darknet markets. This is a fantastic sign. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:56:32
Amen. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:50:41
See here for a recent discussion of this exact question:
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:39:32
Granted, but equally I cannot see a justification for fee to be a percentage. It costs no more to relay a large transaction than a small one. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:43:06


That is simply untrue, read the original article. Each node has a total of 14 open connection, requiring only 7 onchain transactions per node. 


I disagree, please see my previous argument about 'deposit' style Lightning connections. 
Your only remaining argument then is that there will be very few nodes, because security is too difficult/expensive, leading to a monopoly where they can charge exorbitant fees. I completely disagree, security is difficult, but there are plenty of existing precedents for this. But you are right in saying this is all just speculation until the network is up and running. 


Here I agree with you, this model does simply make more sense mathematically, even if it makes many feel uneasy.

100,000 bits is quite an achievement, well done!
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:46:35
No. If a node is just relaying a transaction, it does not result in a higher or lower balance for the node, it gives what it takes (not including the fee).
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:57:43

Good post, it's rare to find solid advice in this sub. 
Can I ask: were there any books you read that helped you learn along the way?
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:03:03
How do you know this?
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:19:48


No it would mean 70 million transactions per person to open and close - if I open a channel with you that is only one transaction. Obviously this does not particularly change your point, but I wanted to mention anyway. 


I completely disagree. The barriers to running a lightning node are very low: you only need to have a PC that is secure and on at all times. Many people have this already, so the cost becomes essentially zero. 
Plus it is not necessary to 'lock up' BTC. Many users (myself included) are much more likely to make payments on lightning rather than receive them, so I could open a lightning network channel into which I deposit 100,000 bits, but where the other party has deposited none. I could still make payments up to 100,000 just fine, I could just not receive any payments on this channell (at least until I have depleted some of the balance). 


Of course users will have control over this. Implementations will allow user to set rules around fees/inform user of the fees before a transaction is finalised. Otherwise as a node I could set a 50% fee or something ridiculous, this would be an absurdly easy attack for it to not be preempted.

Went to a Meetup the other day, honestly the average hodler doesn't know much more.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:58:44
You're right about this number of channels requiring huge number of onchain transactions, which is why I agree that hub and spoke is the only realistic model. 


I don't see why this would need to be the case. For a payment channel to be established, we only need to set up a multi-sig address between the hub and the user. There's no reason why all the funds can't come from the user, this would just mean the user would have to spend funds before they can receive any.

It sounds like you have a good attitude about the whole thing: I guarantee you won't need to learn this lesson twice. And it sounds like you're still passionate about bitcoin, so good on you. Get yourself a hardware wallet and a password manager and jump back on board. 
The downside is: for the rest of your life, every time bitcoin reaches a new all-time-high, you will recalculate how much that 5 BTC would be worth now and kick yourself. No matter how much more you may buy, you will always be thinking about the 5 BTC that got away.

It really is not, think about it. I print out a private key and simply give this to you in exchange for a good or service. What is to stop me from having a copy of that private key and transferring the coins myself after the transaction is finished?

..........fUrnac3.......... is nowhere near as secure as you think it is, and certainly is not practically impossible to crack. It contains 
- A top-2000 most common dictionary word (11 bits of entropy)
- One capital substitution (3 bits entropy)
- Common number/letter substitution (1 bit entropy)
- And the full stops honestly I don't think add any entropy at all, they're just filler, giving a larger character count and an illusion of entropy, but I'll be generous and say and 3 bits. 
This gives you a total of 18 bits of entropy, this is a *terrible* password, trivially easy to brute force. 
[This video]( gives a good demonstration of how easy it would be to brute force that password, and advice for how to come up with a better one.

Not to pile on, but a couple of additional flaws you didn't catch:
- A VM doesn't protect you in the way you think it does. VM is a great place to install software you are concerned may be malicious, but storing data within one does not add any additional security to that data. If they have access to the device that hosts the VM, they have access to the VM. 
- Splitting a seed in half and storing it in two separate locations drastically weakens the security. Not only are there twice as many vulnerabilities, but you have made each individual one easier to brute force by a factor of ~10^19. 
- There is no 'good hacker' out there who is going to get you your money back. It is gone for good.

This video is a fantastic explanation of how the technology works, if you're interested:
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:26:28
I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. Complexity and/or length only matter insofar as they increase **entropy**, and that is what really matters. 
If you assume a targeted attack on you (you should), and you assume that at least one of your other passwords have been compromised (they probably have), then the attacker can easily deduce the structure you use for your passwords. Even if for every different password you use a random punctuation mark and a random quantity at the beginning and the end, this is still adding trivial amounts of entropy. 
Your password should be able to stand up to an attacker who knows precisely how your password is structured. If you’re taking security seriously, you have to work on the assumption of the worst case scenario.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:35:03
How have you addressed the point? Any standard padding before or after is adding negligible entropy.
Also, do not put too much trust in that website. All it appears to be doing is counting characters and registering presence/absence of different character types. Also, I think it was made in the late '90s. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:24:02

@_date: 2017-08-15 11:02:32
You're right, I didn't read the article or watch the video. Although I'm always looking for good new podcasts so I'll check it out. 
Having skimmed it now, I can see the rationale, but he still does not address my point about the risk that another of your passwords would be compromised, and thus your padding would too. Honestly, if you're using a password manager anyway, I don't understand why you would compromise your security like that.  
But, I think we're just going in circles now, and clearly neither of us is going to change the other's mind.

Yes, but expanding the blocksize is not the solution to this. No much how much we expand it, spam attacks can easily expand to fill this new capacity.
