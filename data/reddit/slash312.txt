Its r/Bitcoin so obviously everyone is telling you to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is for sure the safest bet but diversification is always good regarding investments. I would recommend you to check the first 15-20 coins on e.g. coinmarketcap and for what technology they stand for. As soon as mass adoption takes place there will not only be one coin. There will be  some coins for certain applications.
So my recommendation:
Get a decent amount of bitcoin and afterwards invest a bit into coins which have another purpose for e.g. smart contracts.

The real world adoption we all have waited for!

It's so boring to see this chart. Feels like if you look at a repost every 2 weeks.
People lose money, people won't learn anything from it. Who cares :D

"before it hits the mainstream"  
Can't hear this sentence anymore. Pretty much everyone has heard of bitcoin since 2017 peak. Its a solid tech and has  possibly a bright future but we are no early adopters or anything - BTC is here since 10 years. Im also invested in Bitcoin but, for sure, I would not put all my life savings into BTC because of emotions like you did.

In contrast in the EU with the standardized SEPA bank transfer you pay 0 Euro but okay :-D
And btw why do we see this picture getting now posted every day?

I don't understand why these "high amount of money - low fee transaction" type of posts are getting posted every 3 days in this sub. Its the Bitcoin sub, therefore we already know it and we will know it in the next post, which pops up in the next few days about the exact same topic.
Quality posts with interesting content are getting rare nowadays...

That sounds cool but technically it’s not so harsh. You don’t need 5 billion  $ as new money every year. Market cap is not determined by selling all bitcoin at once - e.g. only 1 BTC is sold on an exchange for a certain price which is demanded and you get your market cap even tho just one was traded.

Choose wisely:
Rent a place for $999 or just sleep under the bridge and buy 9690000 Sats monthly.

Every time I see idiots like you posting "every coin is a SHITCOIN except BTC" I just feel so sorry for your one-dimensional thinking and that you are not capable of being open-minded torwards other things.

Yeah was also disappointed. Always sad to see useless shitposts ruined by failures in the picture.
