Rather, it's speculation
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:13:26
Gambling: you pay a stake for a one-time (the duration of the bet, whether it be a slot machine spin or a sports game), all-or-nothing shot at a predetermined amount of money, on an event you have no influence over. You either instantly win or lose all. The only parties involved are you and the one who set out the bet (usually a casino or a broker)
Speculation: you buy an object (physical or not, crypto included) and you hope will be worth more when you sell it later. The average selling price can in- or decrease, but you will always have the object in your possession and are free to do with it as you please. You will be in direct contact with the market once you are ready to sell.

Not really. They're two different methods of trying to profit from uncertainty. Doesn't mean they're the same thing. 
Not that it matters, both are legal and easily accepted where I live anyways.

If you put $400 down on BTC right now and it somehow ever decreases to $400 (about a 97% drop), you would have around $14 worth of BTC left.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:54:56
Ledger lets you set custom fees as well, so this is all on OP
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:24:48
It's not really a different set of rules. If you buy stocks worth $400 and the company completely bombs, you lose your money as well. 
Say as an example, you buy $400 worth at $10k, this buys you 0.04 BTC. From that moment on, whatever a BTC is worth, 4% of that is the value you own at that moment. So, if BTC were to rise to $20k, your $400 will have turned into $800. 
Subsequently, if it were to drop to $5k, your 0.04 stake will be worth $200 at that point. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:11:12
That's a different argument and there's plenty wrong for now, but you don't *need* to follow Ledger's recommendation. Just commenting on choco's point here.

No one will be able to give you a real prediction here. There's no idea when or if a complete crash will come, and how bad it would get. If Bitcoin becomes a global currency and overtakes fiat (which could happen, for example dealing with a crashing dollar due to war with North Korea), it'll go to the moon. If a fatal flaw is discovered, this shit will be ran into the ground badly. All I can tell you is that it *won't* just be a correction, it'll take something far bigger to bring Bitcoin way down.   
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:54:03
We officially reached €3k on Friday when I was drunk. One party and two hangovers later, we officially reached €3.5k an hour ago. Come on bitcoin, I can't even drink fast enough to make up for that.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:40:24
Worldwide, sure. But if only the market you live in (US dollar, Eurozone etc) and the rest of the world is still doing well, Bitcoin might do a far better job keeping its value than your current fiat. You can see that in how BTC growth isn't the same in every market. Not saying that this is the reason anyone should enter crypto, but it's a thing to keep in mind.

Because if it isn't spent, it will never succeed as a means of payment, destroying most of the value it has beyond the technology itself. 
Best thing right now would be to buy things with Bitcoin, and buy the BTC you spent back (hopefully with low enough fees, potentially after Segwit activates)

"Back to yesterday's value" isn't a dip
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:24:56
I'm pretty sure they were accurate...and then hedged against that. I consider this the struggle of a bank realizing that bitcoin could actually harm them.

No one knows the real answer to your question here. The prices could rise significantly, but also fall. By spreading, you're certainly lowering your risk, but it might also cost you. The general direction for bitcoin has only been up recently, but it's still a very volatile option.

The way I'm reading the OP, he's asking whether he should go into crypto or not if he wants to his amount all the time, to reassure himself that it's still all there. A type of OCD is one where you check a million times to make sure you did something, or something is still there, and OP reads like he has that.

This isn't about handling criticism. Bitcoin isn't perfect, but the points the author makes are just flat-out wrong. It's like he read about the subject once, then thought about it for an hour what his stance on the subject should be and then fabricated a couple of arguments without basis. This isn't a matter of opinion or criticism, but complete misinformation

My Ledger gave me the option to "max" the amount. So, the maximum amount you could send with fees on top. Otherwise, I guess it's trial &amp; error, or perhaps there's a tool out there that does it for you (there probably is)

Don't have to convince me, mine are locked away tightly. But with OCD, just "letting them be" might be hard. People with OCD sometimes check their shit all the time, and everyone has different tendencies. I think OP is asking whether someone with OCD has experienced similar things with crypto. I can't help OP any further than I did, but it could be a serious thing.

I always held the idea that Kim Jong Un never had any intention of attacking the US or South Korea, but that all this military display is a way of showing off towards his own people and remind them how "great" North Korea is, and that he could "totally" take on the world's biggest powers if he had to.

I don't know if it works the same with Trezor, but my Ledger had different apps for BTC and BCH, and BCH had a "main" and a "split" wallet. The BCH should be in the "main" part, if you want them on the split part (which I'd recommend if you want to keep them), you have to transfer them to that section.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:12:34
As far as I'm aware, Segwit is supposed to get rid of this (among other things), yes. Seems like some sources are trying to squeeze the last drops they can get out of this.

@_date: 2017-08-15 16:51:53
Value being higher than the demand justifies due to hype, for instance when the media talks a lot about it (like in recent days, same happened with the large dip in June). People get a bit anxious, a lot of new money is involved, making it more volatile. This causes people to sell, flooding the market, causing a correction that drops the value back to what serious investors are willing to pay for it, usually causing a roller-coaster like we're seeing today.

To be fair, BTCDirect and Bitonic (among probably others) already offered this, and the latter has a far higher purchasing limit (allowing up to 20k without registering). Plus, credit cards aren't used all that much in the Netherlands, the majority of people here don't even own one. iDeal is a great service though, so that's a huge plus.

1. You can directly send coins to your Ledger without a problem, saves you some transaction fees as well. 
2. There are obviously fees, like with any Bitcoin transaction. It shows you pretty clearly how much though, and you can choose between fast, medium or slow confirmations (slow also means lower fees)
3. Haven't seen them cheaper anywhere than on their own website

It's not a stupid question, but 


Is not really how it works, as it only applies to that one exchange. It *could* theoretically shut down a single exchange, as people would instantly buy it and sell it for the "regular" price on a different exchange once they've eaten through Ver's coins. His dump would have an effect, but far removed from how you're thinking right now.

Kraken seemed to have been tripping a bit, it's back to "normal" €5740 levels now, which is still up from earlier today but more in line with other exchanges. You won't hear me complain though
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:09:14
No problem man, everyone has to start somewhere. GDAX is one of the better known exchanges, but still handles only a small portion of the bitcoins available around the world. There are days where GDAX already had 25k BTC worth of transactions, and 25k BTC would be a slow day for Bitfinex for example. So while it would have some influence (it still increases the supply side), it's not as devastating as you might think.

Because people know it. The success of anything relies on the willingness of people to use it. If you ask random people on the street, you will find a decent group that has at least heard of bitcoin. The group of people that have heard of other coins is *far* smaller, or they're not even aware that there is more than one crypto currency. Of course this can all change in the future, but this is one of the main things bitcoin has going for it.

Yes, or (and bear with me here) terrorists want the most attention and coverage they can get with their actions. What'll have more impact, an explosion in Paris, one of the capitals of the world and stronghold in Europe, or one in Prague, a lovely city in a country most Arabs *and* Americans couldn't even pronounce properly? The only reason the US is largely safe so far (outside of 9/11) is because you can't get there by land, otherwise they'd have been an even more attractive target.
