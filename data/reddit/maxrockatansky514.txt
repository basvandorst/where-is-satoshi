This is where government regulation could help provide clarity between the 2 and have B-Cash change all of their verbiage to reflect that it is B-Cash and not Bitcoin.  Ending the confusion once and for all!  Isn’t regulation all about “protecting the consumer”?

As long as that new address is tied to a new seed (like in my case, with the new Trezor device)?  
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:42:18
So if I’ve held my Bitcoin on a Trezor 1 since early 2017, now have a new Trezor T with new seed, move my Bitcoin from Trezor 1 to Trezor T, this will eliminate the risk when exposing private keys when claiming forked coins that are stored in Trezor 1 wallet addresses?  Please confirm.   Also, if I use coinomi wallet, do I import the seed from Trezor 1 which will show me the old addresses that had Bitcoin on them?  Just trying to understand what I would need to do and what I’d see during this process.

�� Awesome ��. Alphaville in any form is great.  They actually are  innovators in technology.  They were the first to use CD+G in 1989.  And just generally very innovative in making their music.  I met the band in the late 90’s and recently have considered asking them if they’d accept BTC for their music.  They may actually do it I suspect, being that BTC is a significant innovation��

That’s the hard part, getting pulled into the hype Xmas 2017 and experiencing the fall.  I’m going through the same thing but had more lead time to invest.  But my portfolio is down huge and I too can’t touch it or rather won’t touch it as I have seen on many occasions, those that HODL win.  Just know when to sell.  Ideally, you won’t need to sell to fiat but rather use your crypto anywhere.  Short term pain for some long term gain, it will get better.

Verge was adopted by Netcents, exposing Verge to millions of vendors to accept Verge as payment.  The Verge team has had its ups and downs but they seem to be relentless with constant announcements of adoption.  Don’t forget, Mindgeek and TrafficJunky were huge exposures.  Anyhow, to navigate to topic back to Bitcoin, it will rise and so will the rest of your portfolio.

One other point, people are too quick to call Alt coins, shitcoins.  I have a number of these non-Bitcoin coins (disclosure - except BCash, got rid of that stuff) and there is some really cool things being offered.   Everyone says buy only Bitcoin, sure, yes I agree buy Bitcoin but why not diversify.  When I only owned Bitcoin, my portfolio was highly volatile.  Once I diversified, the volatility dropped somewhat.  Now with the massive drop this year, very little can insulate you from a significant drop in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:45:11
Continue to do your research on Verge, much much much more happening.  Be patient, you only lose if you sell.  HODL applies to all coins unless your research tells you otherwise or you hit the price you had in your plan.  Hang in there, there will be another opportunity to feel euphoria again when your portfolio moons!

That would be a great initiative to analyze the success / failure of TA’s.  Big task but the short answer, TA’s are simply a perspective / interpretation of the data and does NOT have any merit predicting human behaviour.  But it would be interesting to have a full scale study on crypto TA’s.

@_date: 2019-08-11 12:54:26
Something also to consider (as mentioned by Anthony Pompliano in a recent interview) is that at some point (I believe sooner rather than later) a country will go all in and embrace BTC.  That will start a domino effect where remaining countries will have to play catch up or be left behind.  I think Bulgaria already has more wealth in BTC than in its gold reserves.  So perhaps we are even closer than we think to that pivotal moment.
@_date: 2019-10-28 11:06:06
Yeah I guess, I’ve been preaching to friends and family for so long, kind of get lazy.  There is so much information out there for one to read, I guess I am hoping if people have made it to r/Bitcoin, there must be some level of knowledge present.  But duly noted ��

Hodl, Hold On For Dear Life - I take it as don’t be afraid to buy bitcoin.  And when you do, it’s a wild ride.  Spend it, hold it whatever you choose, just be ready for the rollercoaster ride.  Yes, you are correct, usage drives up value.  Traders who buy and then sell back for fiat is not helpful.

The whole system is manipulated (gold for example), either the SEC goes back and re-acesses all of their past approvals or allow BTC ETF to join the party.  SEC is hypocritical.  I don’t care if it’s approved or not but I believe there are greater powers at work influencing their decision.  Bitcoin is a disruptor and their are many paradigms at risk if Bitcoin succeeds.  Those paradigms will fight tooth and nail to survive.

You must consider the use of a hardware wallet.  Please order directly from the manufacturer which ever one you choose.  There have been compromised devices sold by 3rd parties.  
My vote is the Trezor Model T.  Outstanding device, no one is getting your Bitcoin with this device.  Advice though, whichever device you choose, you will be creating a “seed” password (a collection of words) that allows you to retrieve your crypto even if your device is stolen, broken, lost in a fire - just by buying a new device and reentering the seed password.  
Be creative on how to safely keep your seed password but never ever store it digitally.  You will be writing it down twice.  Stored in 2 different locations (in case your place has a fire) or there are titanium plates you can buy and stamp your seed words (heat resistant).  
Or find a book and buy 2 copies, find the seed words in the book and note the page # and number of words it is positioned on that page - now you have a code ie 44-789 (pg 44, 789 word on page) - store one book at your place the other at your parents (hide it in your old room or something) now just have to always remember the title of the book - easy and keep these random numbers safe that will mean nothing in case someone gets a hold of it.
I’ve been creative when storing my seed password through other means and I know that this sounds overkill.  But taking theses initial steps makes it as secure as secure as can be and you’ll sleep soundly each night.   Taking care of your own wealth requires significant considerations, so yes this approach may be overkill but isn’t your hard earned wealth worth keeping safe?
Now your cold wallet is accessible for general use by a pin # you create.  Commit by memory (use at least 8 numbers - can backup similarly to the seed words) and your need of the seed words only comes into play if the device is stolen, stops functioning, physically broken etc.  So really it’s like having a bank card for your PC but you can use it even if your computer becomes compromised, it’s that good.  
Always perform updates for the device you choose.  Do your research on which device but I do think the Model T Trezor is a great cold storage device.  I think you’ll be thanking your boss in the next 3 years or so for making this suggestion and following through with it ��.  Hope this has been helpful.

I encounter the same response in my circle of friends, co-workers and acquaintances.  No drive at all to scratch the surface of BTC / crypto.   I guess being plugged into the Matrix is more comfortable for them.

I know it can be done safely but there is still so much to be understood (myself included) better to be as safe as possible.  But I do believe BCH and BTG have good coin splitting processes out there so moving to a new address should be fine at the minimum.  But for ultimate piece of mind, new seed / wallet is “for sure”.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:36:43
Absolutely ��. Maybe with Bitcoin’s assistance and after the reopening of Notre Dame, they’ll accept BTC at the door for entrance fees.  But then again they will likely have to several decades to opening day anyway accept BTC ��. Perhaps put a small stone carving just on the front entrance the ‘B’ symbol.
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:33:39
Specifically, move the BTC to a completely new seed / wallet for good measure.

I’ve been experiencing the same thing with some family members and friends.....guess they chose the BLUE PILL!  One family member works for a bank and is highly trained in business and finance.  He’s been very successful with traditional investing but will not touch crypto.  Risk or not, he’d prefer to know how many boxes of cereal a company will make, output performance, company financials.  The crypto market has so much information (gotta sift through it all) from news and video articles, social media....once you consume that information you begin to see the true narrative.....hence the reason I have never panicked sold....never!  I’ve tried over the past several years to show him the light on crypto but he won’t budge or even acknowledge the disruptive potential it has.  Even further, conducts himself as being almighty and all knowing about investing.  I haven’t nor will I tell him my portfolio increase with a minimal investment which likely has eclipsed any of his investments....it’s tempting to stick my nose a little higher than his for a change but I’m sure sometime soon words will not need to be spoken as my situation will speak for itself.  Just for the record, I’m not a financial guru, just an average joe who works hard for his money but woke up one day and discovered a way to make my money work harder.  The gold rush of our generation!
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:53:56
The problem with banks is they have become a business instead of simply a service.  A business whose appetite for profit and control leads to a continual squeezing of the masses.  For a business that is in the business of money, the amount of waste and gluttony of those running this business is staggering. ......leading to a need for massive bailouts from the same masses they are squeezing!  Don’t kid yourself, I hear about the lavishness conducted from within (family members who work in the industry) makes me gag that I have to rely on this business for a service.  Crypto will help un-tether the cord.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:53:48
Exactly.  I may need to just suck it up and come to terms with it.  I guess the best strategy is to minimize how much Bitcoin to use - continue to pay off more of my mortgage and hope for the price to reach the unbelievable and convert less Bitcoin to pay it down.
@_date: 2019-05-21 09:03:01
The SEC approved the gold ETF.....and they are worried about Bitcoin manipulation? I think they need to revisit the Gold ETF mess and fix that.

When you have the HODL mentality seared into your brain, it’s tough determining when to sell BTC to take care of some fiat debt.  I’ve thought about paying down a % of my mortgage to lower my interest payment (mortgage line of credit) and just pay off as per normal.  I hate paying interest of any kind, rather funnel that cost right back into BTC,

For sure, no intentions for a while.  I recognize the potential.  Tim Draper seems to be guided for the $250k range by 2022.  Let’s hope, would mean less BTC to convert to pay off fiat debt.
