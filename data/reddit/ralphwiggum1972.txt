I think it really depends on your view of what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:20:18
your stance on lightning? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:06:23
no, that guy thinks $50, 48h transaction are crazy... that guy wants a solution and core has know for a very long time about this problem.
You don't wait to upgrade you server after its already crashing. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:03:33
core has not show support for any of those solutions... but they have shown support for transaction fees solving the problem. 
This weekend we hit $50, 48h transactions for BTC... the next spike is inevitable, it would be wonderful if there was a super solution that could scale bitcoin to billions of transactions and keep everyone happy, but there isn't.
you don't just end up at your final version of code, it takes all the previous versions to get you there. 
Lightning could be well over a year away (assuming core is interested in it), i grantee there will be far more costly and crippling events before then.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:09:25
its been pleasure having an informed, educated discussion with you.
All the best, 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:29:34
Just remember, regardless of what segwit does... move a coin around today, we still have a problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:07:28
There isn't, 
its now a discussion of store of value or currency... i personally see it as nothing more than software and we should find a way to do both
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:39:32
i don't understand what "local price for bitcoin" means...
i live in Zimbabwe and have $7,800 USD... i'm guessing i just don't go to a bank and send it to an exchange of my choosing. Are they just going up to some guy with a BTC ATM and paying them $13,500? for one BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:17:01
So BTC is abandoning the retail applications? There must be a large amount of value in BTC from day one people who see it as a currency and not just a store of value. 
to abandon the retail aspects (and all the value that brings) because you are unwilling to upgrade software is insane to me. I could care less how this problem is solved, but based on the last few months BTC does not seem to have any interest in solving it. 
* Consensus cant be reached, i get it and that sucks
* BCH is a hack split, i get it
* 2x is a hack split, i get it
If there is no consensus with segwit its very unlikely other technologies (lightning) will be met with open arms. If we're forced to commit to a split, take advantage of all you can do in a split, aka, make the coin as best as you can because its a fresh start.
I'm not voting for that, but i dont see BTC having any other choice... I think its already been done via BCH, but if BCH left people with a bad taste in their mouths, i get it. But we cant just sit on our hands and wish the problem away
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:04:38
round we go... 
until next time Art, cheers,
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:50:18
segwit 1x was activated 3 months ago... if you want to see how much support it has received take a look at processed block size. 1MB = no segwit
as for sources on lighting, its the other way around, there are zero sources from BTC saying when lighting will be activated. 
Stop for a second and put yourself in cores shoes... all this fork chaos would be put to bed instantly if they let the public know their development plan for the transaction issue. 
in an instant, this would all go away, but they haven't, and its been months (years depending on who you are).
we hit $50, 48h transactions over the weekend... when can it be acknowledged its gone too far?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:23:33
2x was design to be applied on the main chain, consensus wasn't reached and therefore the attempt was made to introduce it as a split.
1x although introduced back in Augest has so little support its basically not running, you can see see this for yourself. 
Two different paths, consensus not being reached in different ways.

if he's moved a coin around in the last ~week he would know segwit didn't solve anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:19:29
Its just the next technological buzz word the community is latching onto.
At best, its a year away (and thats assuming it can do the job). last weekend BTC was brought to its knees by transaction backlogs... this isn't something that can wait a year
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:45:13
i don't know what specifically you're referring to... but fraud via reddit would only be possible if the readers make the mistake of treating reddit as fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:12:10
i think i have my understanding now.
the part i was missing is why people from outside wouldnt import their coins into the exchange, sell, then convert to an ALT coin to withdraw to their un-inflated exchange, buy more BTC and repeat...
From my understanding in that exchange the ALT's were inflated as a result as well.
Moral of the story, the person willing to import, risk their profits in fiat while things calm down then buy back to pull out would have made a real killing.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:40:20
welcome to the new bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:31:26
in regards to your post about individuals being able to run nodes is important? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:47:50
ahhh so the price of BTC is pretty much the same, but the inflation of the local currency not being adjusted rapidly makes it seem like $13,500?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:54:25
It was like this 3 months ago and it will happen again... BTC isn't really being used widely as a currency right now, so just as a store of value its still being put to its knees.
the cause is irrelevant, my web server example is a good analogy. If my server is susceptible to attack bringing my site down, do i fix the issue or tell people to stop using the site for 3-4 days?
nvm the battles within bitcoin right now, a malicious 3rd party could make countless amounts of money clocking the network and buying the swings... over and over
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:03:45
that's no a solution for a retailer... massive risk on trusting your customers that the retailer would be unable to confirm for days/weeks under a transaction not tagged as RBF
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:50:23
this site makes perfect sense to me... a few hundred in variance justifying the work for someone to take advantage.
i just don't understand how that number got to $13,500.00
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:25:31

@_date: 2017-11-15 18:51:01
its software just isn't keeping up with demand... that's it (good place to be) 
but something needs to be done, and like anything else.. it should be done before shit hits the fan, not during
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:09:32
there is zero merit in comparing visa to BCH... i wont even bother
the current transaction issues have destroyed retail aspect of bitcoin, making it little more than a store of value. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:14:37
great explanation... the key i was missing is that ALT would have likely been inflated as well, making a clean/quick exit impossible.
that means to enjoy the profits you would have to let them sit as local fiat... and i have no question that risk is worth 2x your money (at least)
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:49:00
i am extremely confused :-S
Golix is an exchange like any other... im not putting together how such a price difference occurred?
Sadly i dont understand why that process would change if you were in Zimbabwe or ETHiopia
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:12:50
This is a recent problem hitting users, yes. 
the impending transaction limitations have been know for a very long time. Perhaps long enough for some to figure out you can make more money charging for transaction than fixing the problem. 
I don't think Amazon waited for volume to crash its servers before deciding to increase capacity. the see transaction become as bad as they have and core still vetting solutions is embarrassing. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:32:00
lol until the next transaction backlog!
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:15:13
Has this happened before? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:15:15
preaching to the choir when it comes to crypto vs. fiat.
but the chance of a credit card being charged backed is because of fraudulent activity by user. If people know retailer X has no means of confirming transaction well after they are gone... it will be a free for all
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:35:28
what i own i in ALT's, locked away for long term holding or in an exchange... if segwit can do the job i am 100% on board, but that's not my call
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:38:53
i was also missing the spike in the ALT's... without that there is no easy escape, and the risk really starts adding up.
Your thoughts on exploiting a nation is equally as impressive as it is terrifying lol 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:07:32
BTC software has hit a technical limitation due to its own popularity. (transaction capacity)
Just as in August, the situation has worsened this weekend. Transaction fees were above $50 at points and confirmation times took upwards of 72hs.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:11:50
You're being given poor advice...
segwit 1x although introduced into BTC has struggled to get support from miners and wallets. from the last I've seen (few days old info) the vast majority still do not support it. You can verify this yourself by checking the block size currently being processed on BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:35:59
that's great, back your main horse... just don't have everything riding on it
careful with LTC, it seems to be almost directly tied to BTC
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:57:19
i'm on bard anything that will act as solution towards the transaction problems being solved... segwit has had three months, how much longer do we wait?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:41:48
Has this happened before?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:25:20
ALT coins are competitors... its like saying why does Nissan have to oppose Ford.
I hope you are not mixing up ALT coins and BCH? BCH is an attempt to fix a technical limitation with BTC seeing how consensus is unreachable. 
BTC has a problem that cant be ignored any longer, i have little interest in how it gets fixed, but it does have to get fixed
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:24:06
The difficulty adjustment didn't put BCH above BTC, it created large swings enabling miners to jump back and forth.
With that being fixed on BCH's side, it will stabilize the swings stopping miners from jumping back and forth (short term)... but (the most important part) it will in no way fix BTC's transaction issue.
i don't care how it done, $20,$30,$80 transaction costs! there is a problem, we need to fix it and waiting for lighting may be too long. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:22:52
not the price... the transaction backlog
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:25:21
simple analogy:
* My web server is crashing because of popularity, you hit 1 million users 
* I hope to have 1 billion users one day
do i sit and let my server crash over and over while i wait for someone to invent a 1 billion users server? or do i upgrade to a 10 million users server?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:36:14
but they arnt... what did we hit during the weekend shit show, 1.06?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:55:45
if BTC would have avoided the disaster from this weekend, BTC would be at $10k right now, no question. that is money that is not in your or my pocket. 
Regardless if this weekend was a result of an attack, to simplify, just like a web server, you're not going to let hackers keep bringing your server down... you upgrade and prevent it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:53:40
don't believe for a second LN could be implemented without heavy involvement from core. 
but we're debating over possibilities. Core has known about the transaction bottle neck for years, if LN was a realistic option it would already be in place. 
Without the weekend disaster i would guess BTC would be @ 10k, you are paying a price for core doing nothing while the problem got/gets worse.
you run a web server, would you wait until its crashes repeatedly to come up with an upgrade? and then once crashing, letting it keep crashing while a solution is invented?
Take a step back, this is a corporation/group who do not understand software. If in its adolescents FB lets its servers constantly max out while they waited for an upgrade that would scale to a billion people, we would all be using myspace. 
i question how effective these conversation are anymore, it would seem the decision is/will be made by very large players and the next transaction backlog(s)
 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:54:36
i see what you're saying... but we're just setting ourselves up for defeat sitting on our hands. 
People will become more proficient with attacks as long as it remains a possibility. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:07:05
dig deep, find out when this transaction issue was known... how much longer you going to wait?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:28:45
does BCH only have one dev? i haven't dug that far. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:16:50
for free? there is a hefty bill that has already been covered by your potential gains.
a server for billions of transactions does not exists and would need to be invented, but a server for 10 million maybe 100 million does exist... more than enough capacity for the next few years under the current growth model.
Do you let your servers crash waiting for the invention or do you upgrade?
Core is not a group that understands software life cycles. Core lacks understanding that you need windows 95 and all the versions it took to get to windows 10. There is no such thing as settling with windows 95 while you invent windows 10. 
Please remember, this is not a new issue, known for year(s)... once the value of ridiculous transaction fees was realized, i don't believe any business model would ever let that go.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:48:19
so then it is a result of the local currency not being inflated fast enough... was someone actually paying $13,500 USD for 1 BTC? why wouldn't they go to any other exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:42:34
There is no war.
Just a technical limitation with software and the available options to alleviate it.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:09:26
ya, no point withdrawing fiat... but convert to another coin in order to pull out move to an exchange that does not have inflated price.
but as you said, likely this resulted in the ALT's inflating similarly, i see now how this could have resulted in a pocket of inflated crypto.
very interesting!
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:16:45
$50 48h confirmations and its BCH doing the burning?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:39:42
there are loads of options out there... and there was loads of time considering people anticipated congestion a very long time ago.
but as you noticed, not much seems to be getting done.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:48:05
reduced supply, wouldn't that drive the price of USD up? meaning a BTC would cost less than the real price because USD is over valued there.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:17:34

When my BTC transaction back in August took 7 hours... it raised my eyebrows
use this recent weekend and built a trend line and draw your own conclusions. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:41:24
I don't think they are trying to centralize bitcoin... but things don't seem to add up. 
Bitcoin has a transaction problem right now, not a big deal, loads of options to fix it... yet they enable these forks by doing nothing, which is very damaging to BTC. 
You said it in your post above:
"I would love to see some proposal from our devs with the list of pending improvements"
I could not agree more, if they did something that simple all this fork nonsense would fade away to nothing... but they arnt, its been months and they still arnt, thats what makes me think motivations are not a clear cut as once assumed. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:47:00
i assumed they had a local exchange they use there... maybe that's the source of my confusion.
let me take a step back:
If i'm in Zimbabwe, I have $13,500 USD and intend on buying 1 BTC, what method are they using?
I'm assuming they have an online exchange that they use? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:53:33
i am not on BCH's side, core's side, nor segwit 1 &amp; 2... i just want to see a solution to the transaction problem that will continue to cripple bitcoin if nothing is done. 
As things stand right now, i believe the Bitcoin community is being very naive regarding core's intentions. The transaction limitation have been know for months, years... and solutions are being R&amp;D'ed now? That's akin to Amazon waiting for their server to crash from volume before figuring out what to do. 
There isnt a business model in existence that would abandon high transaction fees once they've tasted them. 
I hope i am wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:56:10
the Golix servers?
assumptions i'm making:
* investor has $13,500 USD cash
* has a cell phone with internet
* goes to the local bank and transfers the money to Golix 
* user, from his phone logs in and purchases 1 BTC
That BTC is only worth $7,700... who is getting the rest of that money? is it the bank, because as you said they could be robbed tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:34:15
Simplify the situation and separate yourself from the noise.
BTC has hit a technical limitation, there is no question is has to be fixed.
a solution that satisfies all parties and reaches consensus appears to not exist, its been months/years and multiple attempts have failed.
you cant just sit back and let your web server keep crashing under its own popularity... something has to be done
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:23:28
From what i have put together, Core has different goals now.
core doesn't owe bitcoin owners anything, its not a comparable relationship to that of a stock owner and company. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:02:33
lol its been fun BakersDozen, we're talking about nothing now (my fault bringing analogies into it)
i think we're all looking for the same thing... BTC fixing it software transaction limitation.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:57:42
A bigger block = centralization is a very weak argument. 
regardless, the transaction problems of today far outweigh the risks
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:26:12
Some great points, but isn't the transaction problem at the root of all this?
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:02:22
Segwit saved litecoin... i would think longer term if i were you
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:35:16
i was looking into exactly that, but it would seems to really pull it off you have to risk you money in local fiat until the situation calms down... thats a hell of a risk
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:44:46
i would need pages to respond to that.
BTC has hit a technical limitation, i'm just looking to support a solution to that. sitting and doing nothing will cause BTC to collapse. 
right now its only being used as a store of value and it cant keep up
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:34:51

not sure i fully understand how the price can be so far off the "price"?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:41:07
does shill imply i'm being paid? i assure you that's not the case. BTC investor who saw $2-3k of his money taken away this weekend. 
BCH wins, Segwit wins... i could care less... i just want to make sure the transaction problem is fixed.
As it stands today we are further way from a transaction solution then we were in August. 
Another weekend like what we just had, and we all loose another 2-3k
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:12:20
it doesn't have $50 transaction fees and multiple days confirmation times
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:30:34
Doesn't the underlying issues of transactions still remain? 
isn't that what this entire circus of forks was intended to fix? 
So BTC pushed back 2x and won... but that doesnt mean the problem is any closer to getting fixed. thats the part im having trouble understanding 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:55:22
when purchasing a coffee with any transaction i expect the transaction to conclude before leaving the store.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:02:43
*storm from the weekend was weathered at extreme cost*
your server wont crash again until its next usage spike... short sided 
BTC would probably be around $10k right now if it wasn't for the hit on the weekend. look deeper into the actual costs of the transaction problem
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:32:49
I agree with your clarification... but that does not offer any insight into how or why a retailer would be pushing for BTC under the circumstances. 
I think a flooding of information in all directions has confused the narrative so badly people don't know left from right. you cant possible think under the current circumstances this retailer backing bitcoin makes any sense.
what are his hours? 9-5 *excluding times of high volume on BTC? 
 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:55:28
lol right
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:28:44
Diversification is the name of any investment game. 
Draw your own conclusion towards BCH, regardless you should be spread a bit more into ALT as well
LTC and ETH are your obvious players, but im still holding on to zcash (and iota for now)
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:51:56
That's what im thinking... @ $13,500 everyone here should have imported their BTC to the Zimbabwe exchange. sold our BTC for $13,500.00, then purchase ETH (at normal price?) move the ETH back to your home exchange and sell the ETH back to BTC for 2x the amount
The issue must have been caused by mass inflation to their currency, meaning BTC would not have been the only one to shoot up
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:33:32
Its been months, agreed, im not saying a solution should already be in place... but BTC core isn't saying anything while fees continue to increase and transactions take longer and longer. 
All they would have to do is let the public know what their future plan is (a development plan), that would kill all this split/fork nonsense and value would stay safely in BTC... but they havnt.
And thats all under the assumption consensus can be reached with the "soon to be discovered" method. which is unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:38:59
transaction verification doesn't just ensure there wont be a double spend. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:14:15
did they attack back in August too?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:18:11
Reversing is a whole different ball game... i'm picturing a retailer with a lineup of customer who know the transaction cant be confirmed until their are long gone
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:28:03
that does not explain variable costs shooting up to $100.
* secure storage is done by exchanges and wallets... and they are compensated for it
* Buying, exchanges &amp; compensated
* operating, variable? makes little sense to me
* maintaining, BTC atm's have their own fee attached to the transaction.
i'm not seeing much justification to blindly accept these fees
BTC has a problem, its just a technical limitation that needs fixing, its being blown out of proportion right now but turning a blind eye or justifying not fixing it is not the answer. 
It would be so easy for BTC to crush all these splits by just telling people what their plan is to fix the problem... them staying quiet is worrying, and its been months
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:09:37
mainstream store of value?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:12:26
i don't know if consensus wasn't reached because of insufficient testing?
in X months if 2x dies due to lack of popularity (not functionality) people will then agree to put it in? long shot as i see it
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:27:13
how long until a software vulnerability enabling attacks is fixed?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:45:12
This is the part im not getting...
*Bitcoin that cannot be met with local supply*
what does local supply a bitcoin mean? im picturing a guy with a safe full of physical coins that he's pricing. 
if local supply means the Zimbabwe exchange, why arnt other people moving coins to that exchange, selling, buying ETH or whatever, moving back to their normal exchange and making 2x the money. where is the risk with that strategy? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:05:25
Consensus wasn't reach for both segwit 1x and 2x... this is the root of the problem &amp; why we need to do something else
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:44:17
a retailer is defending the current status of BTC transactions!? this is crazy
I think both sides have muddied the water so badly its now impossible for people to get any answers. 
/bitcoin is arguing that BTC should not be used for transactions and only a store of value... and then you have a retailer comparing $50, 48H confirmations to $3 CC fee? 
*as time goes on*, regardless of the reason, your web server is going down on the regular, fix it or just let it keep crashing?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:42:12
why wouldn't they buy ETH and then buy BTC with that?
if we're talking a few bucks, i get it... but $13,500?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:43:14
I’m guessing this claim is around quantum computing? 
if so, he's right... Crypto and the rest of the world lol
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:52:23
my goal is to see a solution to this problem... i'm not a picky person and it doesn't matter what that solution is (as long as it works).
Without consensus we are put in a real tight spot, Segwit seems to have failed to get support for 1x and 2x. If you look way back, core has had years to come up with somthing, but the recent talks about BTC just being a store of value terrify me.
like you, i don't know what the answer is, but i am 100% sure we have to do something.

So if amazon servers get attacked do they just tell their customers to wait it out? or do they prevent the attack from occurring again?
BCH is not the solution for world adoption... but that solution does not exist or we would not be talking. 
You don't go from windows 95 -&gt; windows 10... it takes all the versions inbetween

If my web server is susceptible to attack, do i shrug my shoulders or apply a fix?
regardless of the reason, BTC has to find a way where outsiders cant bring it to its knees on demand.

I'm not following? today Thursday? or last week?
regardless of which day exactly, my point still stands; There is a problem and it remains unsolved. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:33:57
huh? the lowest it hit last week was ~5600, congrats if you picked it up at that price, that's sniper level day trading skills.
that's gain of $1,576 per coin as it stands right now?

This comment chain is wasting its breath. it doesn't matter what segwit does in or out of 1MB blocks, if you have moved a coin around in the last week or so its clear as day... we still have a problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:56:10
over the weekend... and in August.
There is a problem, no question. I know exactly where the head-in-the-sand strategy lands us.

i wasn't making the connection on how an online exchange could have a "local" supply... as I've just found out, an exchange only has so many coins, from there they are dependent on people importing which is a risk depending on people(s) knowledge/comfort with the local exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:39:33
Isn't this about a technical transaction limitation? 
don't BTC owners own BCH?
i dont fully get this fight
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:18:06
right, ok, its been great bouncing points back and forth
fingers crossed for bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:13:13
that is the saddest analogy i have read...careful who you compare to
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:47:23
what lessons were learned? is anything going to be done to prevent this from happening tomorrow? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:19:16
i'm 100% with any solution that solves the problem
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:18:05
Its the only way as i see it.
With how information is being presented in all direction, the only way to know the real story is to hear both sides and draw your own conclusions. It’s almost like you have to be your own detective now a days. But this applies to a lot more than just crypto
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:30:06
educate yourself on the possibilities that could cause either a drop on a rise.
Invest accordingly 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:46:45
fun analogy, its a stretch and i don't agree with it (for BTC the road and the car are one)... but it does show me failings in analogies  
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:45:11
then im not keeping up? how could a BTC sell for $13,500
i can understand some exchange variance but shouldn't it have evened out?
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:20:25
i understand now, the connection i was missing is that local fiat was the only exit option short term. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:00:22
Art, you're just making things up now... 
BCH shares aspects of BTC for compatibility, that's where the similarities stop
and again, i'm not here defending BCH, BTC has a software limitation that could not be solved via consensus... BCH is the only remaining viable option. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:36:12
just like last year, around the corner 
once the value of high fees was tasted, its a challenging business model to justify walking away form them.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:11:23
This is not a question of which ALT is better than BTC or BCH... The Alts will always be nipping at  
most BTC owners own BCH as of AUG 1st. a "flip" would result is very little difference to them. a switch to LTC/ETH is doing nothing more than throwing away BTC
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:21:52
i don't follow? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:57:45
seeing how no one would risk applying this to anything more than a cup of coffee stresses my point. The coffee shop is taking a risk with every transaction.
needless risk
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:30:50
the pleasant users of folks.
good luck Art.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:28:05
i don't understand how this is a success for anyone... the problem, and what we're all trying to fix is the transaction problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:31:14
I wasn't a fan of the BCH approach... but seeing the options in front of us now. im becoming one. 
Im looking forward to seeing the impact the EDA fix has
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:51:30
im aware of arbitrage, that's why i was having trouble understanding.
in a nut shell is it a rapid inflation of the local currency before exchanges could adjust?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:40:28
Both can be accomplished, to sit back, shrug your shoulders and say that's a limit to the technology is ignorant. There is a large amount of value in BTC from people who believe in its retail applications. 
its just software, software always has to be upgrade... with the exception of windows 95, i think its  about to come into its prime.
