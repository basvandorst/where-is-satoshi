It's Robinhood, it's actually an investment app. Don't buy Bitcoin you plan on holding long term on it, but it's good for quick trading

Generally agreed, however I will use it for short term trading. Something like this where I see a steep drop, I'll quickly and easily buy on my phone and then sell when it recovers

I don't invest through them, I do short term trading. I'll buy and sell the same day. Very low risk.

If you're planning on holding it for a while or using it for transactions, then don't use Robinhood. However, it's fine for short term trading if you're just trying to buy/sell to make some cash.
