My personal view from speaking with locals, is that people in Cyprus have isolated Danny as the culprit of this failure and not Bitcoin. They are still skeptical of Bitcoin, perhaps as much as they were before, but I think the publicity and the discussions we had with the regulators, will eventually bring the merits to the surface. Everyone on the island now, has heard of Bitcoin. I'd say that's a start.

Guys,  this is getting ridiculous. That space was empty since the building was made and was never part of Neo. Neo offices are OVER that space,  hence the sign on the balcony. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:45:44
Yes it is true. No bitcoins were sold to Cypriots from the company. Danny sold personally though.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:37:53
As far as I know, there have been no reports, despite our repeated efforts to extract accountability from him. The authorities are aware of this, yes.

I've seen "Brewster" tattooed with large fonts all over his back. I think that is his real name.

Because Bitcoin is the revenge of the Next generation. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:27:35
Personally, I admit there were no early signs that he was untrustworthy. Danny was never someone you could connect with easily on a personal level, and this started getting progressively worse in March.

The initial shock of that statement didn't really allow much more coherence at that point beyond a dedication to damage control. Oystein and the CFO went to Danny's office to have a look over the numbers/data and I stayed with the rest in the conference room to figure out a way to move forward.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:00:45
We all hoped everything could be salvaged. We stuck together and tried to draft a restructuring plan given the new circumstances, before Danny abandoned us. The software is very valuable IHMO but most valuable is the conviction and dedication of 40+ people (Neo and PVS) involved in going past all the hurdles (software/ regulatory/ education/ business ) and making this a success story for Bitcoin and Cyprus.

I wholly agree with you. That's why a Board of Directors needs to be appointed by the shareholders to then appoint the CEO, each keeping the others in check for the owners (shareholders). How many 3 month companies with a single shareholder have all those in place? These cases are "father knows best" companies, which go "my way or the highway".
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:19:15
We feel there is a lot of value within everything that was created, so yes, there is hope. 
As for the site, as Oystein replied above, we are no longer employed so we don't know. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:10:49
The authorities are involved, we cannot comment on the extent though.

Danny’s plans before any of us came on board, were shortsighted on multiple levels. What kept us together through it all, was not the brilliance of the plan, but the coherence and communication of the assembled team and its skill sets. We did a concentrated effort to focus on the true merits of Danny’s multi-product approach. We tried coming to terms and explaining to him that too much diversification in untested ventures, would wear us too thin and create more capital demands on the early stages, of an untested startup, in a small market as Cyprus.

Bitcoin is not at any fault, the business was; I'm saying that people recognize this despite the relatively small level of understanding of the technology.

They have no involvement with Neo or any other of Brewster's companies afaik. We did a presentation at their offices one morning but beyond that, I am aware of no other relationship. Me and others demanded he removed that before publishing.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:07:38
There was no CEO change announced on the 14th. Danny is still considered the CEO for all accounts, as far as I know. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:45:34
I do not believe this conclusion was orchestrated from the beginning.

This was a corporate governance failure. It probably happens many more times in normal businesses than Bitcoin businesses. Accountability, transparency and objective auditing is far easier with the tools available in Bitcoin and this serves as a stark example of where it was needed. Despite the fact that it is individuals that are still in control, the chance of fraud would be significantly dampened.

Only the law will judge if the second is true, but usually one goes hand in hand with the other.

The program started in the Autumn of 2014, and the first graduates are just finishing. We have new cohorts of the MSc about a couple of weeks after each MOOC ends, so two times a year (June and December). The free MOOC starts in September 5th.

I'd argue that access to knowledge is not the same as access to information, which I agree is a zero margin business. Knowledge is structured and processed information. If that's coupled with real world experience, it is even more valuable, which is what we're offering.
We are also driven by the desire to expand awareness of the ecosystem beyond polymath early adopters, and that's hard to achieve without a certain degree of structuring or hand-holding. Many of the ~4000 students that have taken the free MOOC so far, have already received this for free, and we're proud to be delivering an up-to-date, no-strings-attached introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

If paid in full, you get a 7.5% discount to the original 11,760 euros and a further 5% if you pay with Bitcoin.

You'd be surprised how many of our past and present students "get" cryptocurrency before joining the course. Yes, you can, and should self educate yourself to the extent possible, but that process is not "more efficient" for all. You don't pay for the credential itself, you pay for the structured knowledge. The credential, signifies to others that you've done the footwork to attain this knowledge under the personal guidance of experts in the field (not unlike PoW).
Beyond that, you'd also be surprised by how many students start off not "getting" cryptocurrency, and attaining that serendipitous moment sometime during the course. We try to invoke that moment during the first part of the course (the introductory MOOC) which is completely free and available to everyone.

Where we're going, we don't need banks.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:24:55
Some or most of the banks, will see Bitcoin as a threat to their "business" model. Some others will eventually see it as a competitive advantage, I'd suggest you try finding those and explaining it to them. They are not all friends and allies. All the banks couldn't pull together if their future depends on it (which it does).
