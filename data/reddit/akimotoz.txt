Government-provided services are generally only beastly in rich countries though.

Well as per the [whitepaper]( Bitcoin is supposed to be a form of peer-to-peer electronic cash - ie. you use it, not HODL forever. Slow, cheap transactions or high, expensive transaction fees make this difficult.

Maybe a couple of days ago, but now? Have fun sitting in the 174k+ unconfirmed transactions queue. You can get ahead by paying a $10+ fee.
It's not a strawman. My point is that right now Bitcoin is a terrible form of electronic cash, as it was originally supposed to be, and that it may be an even worse store of value compared to something like Ethereum because of its high fees.

Chill, I'm mostly in Bitcoin.
Source? High transaction fees have been a problem for a while now.

Newish, but to my knowledge the transaction fee and number of unconfirmed transactions has never been this high. I want to believe it'll be okay but who knows.

This is going to be real. Holy shit.

Not sure what you mean exactly but I live in SA. I can go on takealot.co.za, our biggest online market, and buy shit with my BitCoin. Pretty sure that's on that list.
The first piece of property sold for BitCoin just went down in Dubai or something too, recently.
Edit: The default for those websites is our local fiat, yes, but you can pay with btc too

Who offers the technology to the world. You can buy more efficient miners from Intel/AMD/Nvidia too, but it's expensive. ASIC seems to offer this advantage at a cheaper price. Why do you say 'single' miner?
If Nvidia or AMD suddenly developed a far more efficient mining unit, would you have the same attitude? Bitcoin mining is already centralised, as China largely has the cheapest electricity. Intel mostly controls CPUs, while Nvidia and AMD control GPUs.

Nah I agree, I just think there are a lot of countries (specifically in Africa) that'll follow our lead. Then again I'm really just speculating.

Let's make this interesting!

The more it's used and regulated, the less volatile it becomes though, right? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:43:25
Should've set that to 6 days!

But no one will give a shit about fiat when btc is more stable / secure / worth more than their own fiat and is widely accepted. It's picking up in SA because everyone's losing faith in our own currency - I think that's a trend you'll keep seeing.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:00:50
Lol what? Please justify your opinion, I'm curious too. Do you think that major companies AREN'T investing heavily in Bitcoin and/or other cryptos?

And this doesn't happen with street drugs? Are you aware that the same governments that legislate against drug usage, import and sell the drugs to their own population?

Shockingly it is in fact immoral to encode into law what we can and cannot choose to put into our bodies.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:42:35
Isn't the whole point of BitCoin to not rely on traditional currency? You use it to pay for things on it's own.
You already can do that, by the way.
I know that's not how it works at the moment, but it is the intended goal I think.

Fuck it, I wanna laugh/cry in 6 months too.
