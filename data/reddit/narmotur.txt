Jesus Christ, RES is really screwing me with comment editing lately. Original post follows:
If you have 10 bitcoins, and you send those 10 bitcoins to address1 and then try again to send 10 bitcoins to address2, you submit two transactions to the network. The way bitcoin is currently set up is that nodes will reject the second transaction they hear about, but if you are crafty, you can inject the two transactions at different points in the network, so some nodes will hear about the spend to address1 first and some will hear about the spend to address2 first. Which is the valid spend?
This is where the blockchain comes in (and where 0 confirmation transactions are sketchy); at some point, a block will be written into that chain that makes one of those transactions "official", and this is "1 confirmation". As more blocks get built onto the chain from that transaction, you get 2, 3, 4 etc confirmations.
If you only knew that there were multiple transactions that currently existed, how would you resolve the issue? The blockchain is basically a distributed way to solve what should be a trivial issue, but because it's decentralized, you can't trust anything except for what's recorded in the chain.
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:25:03
You only need a majority of the hashrate (51%) to control all the blocks. [That's why it's called a 51% attack.](
If you can mine blocks faster than the rest of the network put together, you will always eventually be able to mine a longer chain by yourself than the rest of the network can. Since you can do this, you just ignore all blocks anyone but you mine, and then when your chain becomes long enough, the fork is resolved in your favor, the other chain is undone, and you are the winner.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:14:34
A 51% attack doesn't allow "fake" transactions? It allows one entity (who owns 51% of the processing power) to create chains longer than the rest of the network put together. As such, they can always build *only* on their own blocks, ignoring the blocks made by everyone else, and **always** have the longest chain. This means they can, among other things, build a chain with ONLY their own empty blocks. This gives them all the mining rewards AND stops all transactions, until such time as they no longer own 51%.
Alternatively, they could roll back transactions mined by others by unleashing a longer chain on demand, which would allow them to double spend with impunity.
They could also choose to keep including transactions, but still ignore blocks mined by others. This would give them all the mining rewards and transaction fees. I didn't mention this as it wasn't pertinent.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:02:00
Yes, 49% working on a chain that CAN NOT CATCH UP TO YOU, BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE PROCESSING POWER THAN EVERYONE ELSE COMBINED.
If you ignore their blocks, you will always generate blocks faster than the rest of the network, that is the whole god damn point. If you can cause reorgs, constantly, forever, how is that not downing the network?
Even if the other chain can get 6 confirmations, you will, statistically, 100% of the time, eventually get more blocks solved on your own than they can, giving you the longest chain and undoing everything back to your chain. As long as you ignore all their blocks, you always win. If you always win, you dictate the chain, you collect all the rewards, you stop all the transactions.
Edit: For the love of god, look at the god damn [wiki]( on the subject. I'll copy it here:
An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:  
Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.  
**Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations**  
**Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks**
**With less than 50%, the same kind of attacks are possible, but with less than 100% rate of success.** For example, someone with only 40% of the network computing power can overcome a 6-deep confirmed transaction with a 50% success rate.

A new block is generated every 10 minutes, if there are 1,000,000 BTC in transactions, or 0 BTC in transactions.
Many early blocks contain no transactions, because nobody was doing anything, but you still need confirmations (blocks mined past the block that includes the transaction) to cement the transaction as "real". In fact, because of this, there is no requirement to ever include any transactions at all; a valid 51% attack could stop all transactions from happening, completely.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:22:29
The transaction is verified or rejected via putting it in the blockchain or not. Every transaction is traced via the blockchain, so there is no way to have an account balance or transaction without recording it in the chain. The concept of verifying and rejecting a bitcoin transaction is impossibly linked to the concept of recording it in the blockchain.
It's not efficient, and potentially not even useful, but it isn't designed to be either of those, really. The point is to verify a transaction without needing to trust that you have a perfect view of the network, or that you aren't linked to bad actors.

Selling a large amount of coins on any exchange will move the exchange price. If you create a service where you pay the market rate for all coins sent to you, you end up with a situation where you have a lot of coins you have paid $X for, but the act of selling the coins to get your own money back will drop the price to some percentage of X, losing you money.
The only way this can work is if you have unlimited funds to buy coins with, and are willing to sit on those coins until the price rises enough that your sale of them wouldn't drop the price below what you paid. You'd also have to risk the fact the price may drop and you're left with no money and a bunch of coins worth some percentage of what you paid.

Because if you can reliably create the longest chain you can just ignore all blocks from every other pool and simply build your own chain with your own transactions. Eventually your chain will be the longest and the other chain will be undone.

It's not growing as a currency though; pretty much every company that "takes bitcoin" uses it as a chip which is a standin for $X, where X is the current value of bitcoin. At no point do they hold bitcoins themselves, all risk is assumed by another company who takes the bitcoin and gives the seller actual money. (It's not really clear how these companies make money themselves if they hold a bunch of bitcoin which are losing value, surely they have bills to pay.)
It's very very true that you or anyone *could* have made money in bitcoin by buying in early and selling at the right time. However, the right time is impossible to predict because the valuation is so unstable. You are as likely to double your money as you are to halve it. For everyone who takes a profit, someone else is losing money.
Lots of people like to imagine they would have bought in at $1 or $10 or $100 and sold at $1000 before the crash, but why would they not have sold at $2 or $20 or $200? If they wouldn't have sold then, why would they have sold at $1000? It's a dicey prospect. If you treat it like a gamble, then sure, you could make money, but there is nothing you can look at to determine the price of bitcoin on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, which could give you a smart time to sell.
Aside from that, you could deposit your coins in an exchange to sell right before they shut down withdrawls or are hacked, it's a pretty dicey situation with no oversight.
As far as problems with bitcoin itself, a pretty good write-up is here:

Just like you automatically get change from a pizza delivery man? I'm just saying change is a feature of bitcoin *software*, not the bitcoin *protocol*, which seemed to be your implication.
Bitcoin Software = Pizza Delivery Guy, both give change and help make transactions easier.
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:41:19
Actually, with bitcoin, change is manually appended to the transaction by your software of choice or else it goes to the miners. People used to lose their money this way when spending from paper wallets until most web based software accounted for people being useless and nothing being automatic.
If you thought it was automatic you would lose anything you didn't send back to the spending address, so sending 1 BTC from a 100 BTC input ended up with you paying a 99 BTC transaction fee. Pretty good stuff.
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:32:05

The only real way to verify a bill is unspent is to verify the address associated with the bill's private key has the balance indicated on the bill. The downside is that this means you need access to the private key, allowing you to spend the funds, rendering the bill untrustable for future transactions, and it also means you need access to the updated block chain, which seems to negate the real usefulness of the bill.
I suppose a bill issued by a trusted source that requires more work to counterfeit than you would gain by the process, and is destroyed by being redeemed would be best, but it seems to require a level of trust in the issuer that would be better put to use by having bearer bonds which can be redeemed from the trusted source for the value in bitcoins, meaning you don't have to worry the key was compromised and the bill is now "empty", and you don't have to check an address on the blockchain, etc.

Yes, you can access the address through other software with the key, but be mindful that some software (Bitcoin-Qt, Armory, possibly electrum and others) use "change addresses" to send the leftover money from the transaction to, rather than returning it to the original address.

Yeah I know what you mean, and as I said, DNS already has the ability to do this; it has a TXT record that can basically hold anything, but I believe established format is a semicolon separated string in the format "identifer=value;" so your domain bob.com could have a txt record with "btc=1Whatever" and people could send coins to bob.com from supported clients, which would parse the DNS record and grab the address automatically.
Thinking on it, I suppose the record could be something like "btc=steve:1SteveAddress,tom:1TomAddress;" and then you could send btc to something like "steve (to make it a different separator from email) and again, the client could parse the record and pull the data automatically. The problem is that you have a chicken and egg issue here where no client supports it, so no one will use it, so no client will support it.

The point of the hashing algorithm used for Bitcoin (and all cryptocoins afaik) is that it is difficult to compute, but very easy to verify. This allows mining to work as it does; it takes time to find a valid block, but once someone does, everyone can verify it in a fraction of the time.
With a scientific effort like folding the problem is that it's usually hard to verify a result; a lot of the time the same work is sent to multiple clients to weed out cheaters (people cheat at things like folding they send garbage data to get a higher hash rate.) and then if you get X% returned as matching and interesting, someone from the project will look into the results in more detail to verify something interesting is there. There's no way to make this work in a decentralized fashion like the blockchain does.
Would it be possible to create a centralized cryptocurrency that uses scientific work as the mining process? Quite possibly yes, but I don't know if it would have quite the adoption of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:01:21
There is no way to do a one use address.
It would likely require a protocol change, and even then, you're vulnerable to the same problem; they could go home and take the funds out of the paper wallet they just gave you. You have to sweep them immediately, and hope that they don't double spend them, so you'd have to wait for 6 transactions to be sure for a high value transaction. A double spend just means you've undone history, either by writing a longer blockchain where your spend is the "real" one, or getting the miners to include your transaction instead of theirs because you've given it a higher fee.
A transaction doesn't exist until the longest blockchain says it does, and it only exists for as long as that chain is the longest.
Edit: The blockchain doesn't record any private addresses. It only records that public address A has funds from transaction B, and part of the protocol is that public address A's funds can be spent by a special message signed by the private key for A.

It's pretty hard to know. The current network hashrate is something like 60.76 Th/s. If we say that there are 20,000 preorders (it's a guess based on order numbers, assumed refunds, etc) and they are all for one jalepeno (4.5 Gh/s), then at the end of them shipping, the network hashrate would increase 90,000 Gh/s, or 90 Th/s. This could be a fantasy; it's possible they have inflated their order numbers artificially, or people placed orders but never paid, etc, but even half the orders is a pretty big increase. I honestly don't know how steep the difficulty increase would be in this case, it would depend on how fast they ship, the batch size, etc, but a potential doubling of the network hashrate before you get your order seems pretty significant, for what could be a very low estimate of new machines in front of you.
That said, there's also a chance that not that many people have actually ordered, in which case the impact would be minimal, and you would have made a wise investment, assuming bitcoins don't bottom out and the machine isn't drawing more energy than the value of coins, and is actually hitting the advertised hashrate.
Another part of the issue is that *if* BFL starts shipping and the machines make tons of money, orders will flood in, and difficulty will continue to rise until ASIC mining is no longer a money printing machine. How long that may take is anybody's guess.

It's pretty apt though, because a blacklist could only be reactionary, and someone could taint anyone else's funds in the meantime by sending satoshis to addresses people are known to use, "tainting" the whole address.

No, that creates a new address from Bitcoin-Qt's change address pool with the label of whatever you type in the space. A label is just a logical way to put a human friendly name on an address. The only way to import a private key is the way I said, with the debug console. If you want a label on your imported private key you can do **importprivkey 5WHATeVErKeyHere "Label"**.
Edit: Sorry, the address book is for addresses you want to send funds to, like your friend or your porn site. It's just a list of address you may send money to in the future. The rest of my text still stands.

I suppose, assuming you can still destroy btc, that this could be workable, if the blockchain of newcoin encodes that a specific btc transaction has been redeemed to prevent double redeems, although I guess it's vulnerable to a 51% type attack in a future where bitcoins have failed and one person controls the blockchain, undoing and redoing longest chains. I suppose that's potentially a nonissue if you peg the value of newcoins to bitcoins somehow, since they would both then be worthless.

You always send out your full balance. If you don't specifically send the change back to your paper wallet address, the miners will get it as fees. Any good paper wallet transaction creator will automatically send the fees back, but it requires some knowledge of your current balance to do so properly.

I don't think I saw a link when you originally posted this, but it is there now.
My concern is that change not specifically sent somewhere in a transaction is considered part of the fee, and the miners get it. On brainwallet.org when you enter a private key, it generates the address and downloads the transaction info from blockchain.info so it knows how many btc are available to spend. It then subtracts the amount you're sending and the fee from those coins, and creates a transaction to send the rest back to the address. Since you don't include a breakdown of the JSON on the site, there's no way to verify this is happening, and so it seems from a glance that it is only generating one transaction, the one you type in, and so the change would be eaten by the miners. This has happened to people before using brainwallets.

Multibit doesn't encrypt the wallet file, which is a pretty serious weak point. Yes, a trojan could steal it and then take all your coins as soon as the truecrypt drive is mounted.
The key backup is for saving somewhere offsite, in the event your computer explodes or whatever. It contains your private keys and can be imported in the event the wallet is lost.

I think armory uses a deterministic generator, which means their paper backups are used to re-create your armory wallet, rather than being a single address on paper like paper wallets are. The plus side of this means you don't have to worry about change address, etc; the down side is that if your paper is stolen, the entire wallet is compromised, rather than a single address. Either way, paper wallets should be someplace really really safe.

I was being facetious; there could literally be child porn embedded in every website you visit, all the time, and you would never know. The reason is because the method used to embed it is over the top and ridiculous, and the method required to retrieve it needs specialized tools. The same is true for storing things in the blockchain. Nobody would ever be prosecuted for just having the blockchain. Maybe if you had the blockchain and the specialized tools and remnants of actual files on your drive, sure. Not just the blockchain.
For evidence, see any tor user. While acting as a relay, gigs of child porn could be flowing through your computer, but you wouldn't know without taking active steps to deconstruct obfuscated data with specialized tools and reconstructing the illegal files. Nobody is going to be prosecuted for the possibility of something; it's possible you could download some child porn right now, it exists on the internet, and you have all the tools to access it already (a web browser). Are you worried about that?

Every change address has it's own private key. I would assume only the unused change addresses are purged when you encrypt your wallet, otherwise you would be unable to spend any change you had already acquired.
You need to back up your Bitcoin-Qt wallet.dat before 100 transactions have passed since the last backup if you want to be sure you'll be able to access all your coins. Your passphrase only secures your wallet.dat, if you lose the file and your backups, your passphrase is useless. Bitcoin-Qt is not a deterministic wallet; it cannot rebuild your addresses from just your passphrase.
Getting the private key from a wallet.dat is essentially useless if you plan to keep using it, as the coins will likely be in one or more change addresses most of the time. However if you want to you can use **dumpprivkey ADDRESSHERE** in the Help / Debug window / Console tab; if the wallet is locked you will need to type **walletpassphrase "Your Passphrase Here" 60** to unlock the wallet for 60 seconds first.

If the transaction hasn't been confirmed yet you could double spend the whole value in the wallet to a new address with a higher fee and see what happens?

Strange, if you import the private key into current bitcoin wallet **importprivkey PRIVATEKEYGOESHERE** (this will freeze up your Bitcoin-Qt client for like 5 minutes probably, just let it sit there) do you suddenly gain 0.00005 BTC to your total? I'm curious about this because if you *do* gain those funds, it could mean that Bitcoin-Qt uses a rolling key pool or something, and is not safe to use for a multitude of quick small transactions like satoshidice, because once you exhaust the keypool it forgets all the private keys and generates new change addresses; any winnings would then be lost.
I can't imagine it works this way because surely it would have come up before now, but the fact that you were able to pull the private key from a recovered older version but not your current install makes me wonder if this is exactly what happened.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:03:52

It's really hard to dump the amount of coins they'd produce every day without tanking the market probably. They'd also need the upfront capital to produce the ASICs.

There's no single "answer" block that everyone is looking for, they're just looking for a block that matches the current difficulty conditions. It is possible for two valid blocks to be mined at nearly the same time; in this case different miners start building off different blocks, and at some point one chain becomes longest and "wins", becoming the official block. Normally this happens within one block, but longer chains are possible. Blocks are "limited" in that infinity is not a real number, but there is no real limit within a human timespan. In the event a future galactic civilization of humans start to run low on blocks, they can just change the protocol to a larger hash.

BTC is too high risk since you cannot recover the funds if someone charges back. You're basically pissing away money if you allow easy purchases like PayPal/Credit Cards, as those mediums are stolen and abused over and over countless times every day. The security comes from working within the system of recovery in place through banks and credit card companies; this doesn't exist with bitcoins. You'd have to charge huge huge markups to cover your potential losses depending on volume, and then people won't use your service. This is an unsolvable problem by the design of bitcoin; the systems are incompatible. It's not a weakness, it's just a fact.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:19:54
There is no server to do anything; the client generates a new address pool when you encrypt. I imagine the reason for this is that if it didn't do this, any new addresses you add or any change sent to a change address would be from the unencrypted backup, and so an address could be compromised even if you didn't "create" it until after you encrypted. Generating a new pool sidesteps this issue. The private key for the main wallet address doesn't change; it's always one priave key per address, if the private key changes, the address changes.
Any time you send BTC out you're likely using one address from the pool, and any time you generate a new receiving address it comes from the pool. If you back up every 50 or so payments/generations, you'd probably be more than fine, but it's probably best to work out on average how many addresses you go through and work out a timed backup scheme, so that you just "back up every X days" and don't have to worry about counting and tracking the date of your last backup etc.

Every transaction is one input, so if they want to respend 1000 transactions, thats 1000 inputs into the next output, not 1 input. Once those transactions are respent, they will be consilidated as 1 input for future spending, but that's what you're paying the miners to do in this case.

It goes into your exchange account. Saying "wallet" is confusing when talking about bitcoins; only bitcoins go in bitcoin wallets. In theory you can hold the private key for an address and have it at every exchange that allows wallet imports (in practice I think funds are swept into an account the exchange holds to prevent double spends); in the event the exchange disappeared you'd still have access to your bitcoins (again, probably not the way things work currently, but technically possible). There's no way to do this with USD though. Your money on Mt Gox is stuck there. You can withdraw it and then put it on another exchange, but you can't access it at both simultaneously, and if the exchange disappears, you've lost your funds.

You have no idea if the private key even matches the address printed. The problem with "physical" bitcoins is the only way to positively verify them is to redeem them. They're one time use and need to be redeemed  immediately to make sure the private key is valid and not copied down some where; what's the advantage?
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:00:07
Short answer: Not really.
Long answer: Yes, but decentralized and pegged seems like a lot of work for nothing. It'd be much easier to create a centralized digital currency pegged to another currency; you go to them and give them money, and you get the digital currency. You go to them and give them the digital currency, and you get the money. How will you do this in a decentralized manner? The release mechanism would need to be trust based, probably, you would need to trust the "miners" are actually only converting in a 1:1 ratio, and how do you actually ensure people can get their money back out 100% of the time? You could try a ripple-like system of debt trading, but even in that system, exchanges can default on their debt. You're likely to just end up with a house of cards that eventually collapses in on itself when a bank run happens.
@_date: 2013-03-31 20:15:24
Traceability allows anyone to verify coins haven't been created from nothing and transactions are all correct. The downside is that this means best practice is to not reuse addresses; the default client sends all change from every transaction to a new address, but this is confusing for a lot of people.
In a perfect world, you'd never reuse an address, and so no one can be sure at which point the bitcoins stop being in your control. In practice most people like having a few addresses they reuse; in this case, you can opt to use a mixing service like blockchain.info's "send shared" for a small fee.

Seems like it would have to be centralized to verify coin destruction in some fashion; the bitcoin protocol doesn't really support destruction, although you used to be able to mark coins as only being spendable by an impossible key. Not sure if you can do that anymore though, aside from sending them to a really unlikely to be generated address. Either way, the only way I can see it working is if you put your private key somewhere, the coins it controls are verifiably destroyed by the entity you give the key to, and you are rewarded X newcoins for doing so.
People around here aren't huge fans of centralized cryptocurrencies.

A better question I think is "How can anyone prove they are the **true** owner of some bitcoins?" With bitcoins, possession is 10/10ths of the law: whoever holds the private key, controls the fate of the ~~universe~~ bitcoins in that address. At best, someone could prove a purchase chain for some coins, but there's no way to prove (in my mind) that you didn't own an address first, and the original person didn't accidentally deposit them into the wrong address, etc. Since bitcoins are fairly anonymous, you can set up the same claim to a purchase chain, at which point I suppose it would become "battle of the best proof of purchase", but that sort of crashes head on into the anonymous factor.

Technically if you're talking about one party having internet access and one not, you could maybe do something a lot simpler; generate a signed transaction and just have the other party publish it using something like 
You could generate the full transaction on your device, sign it, and then the other person can submit it and you can verify on your device (via pushing a button or something) it's gone through. I'm not certain how easy it would be to line this up with the change transactions that come back though; I haven't really thought about this for very long and I'm sure there's a sensible reason it won't work. Possibly the inability to reference the change transactions?

Difficulty is not connected to coins. Difficulty tries to insure constant 10 minute per block times, to regulate transaction speed.
Coin generation is fixed at 50 per block, divided in half every 210000 blocks. At some point, around 2140, this will result in a block reward under 1 satoshi, meaning the reward is effectively 0 coins.

Another fix is to send your transactions with fees. That said, I think there is already some support for resending a transaction with a fee, but I could be confusing it with a proposal...

The chain grows by one block every 10 minutes. It could stop growing if all miners stopped mining, and if half stopped mining (from a Gh/s perspective) it would take 20 minutes to add a block for a while.
In the future it could be possible that there are no transactions, and miners aren't rewarded for finding blocks anymore, so nobody would mine until enough transactions are queued up; however this will be in 2140, and if there are no transactions at that point, bitcoin is likely dead.

Because the person/pool who mined it only included a very small amount of transactions?
Alternatively, because there were only a very small amount of transactions in the time between the previous block and that block?
Either is possible, depending on when in history you're looking.

You can export your wallet under the Import/Export options, Export Unencrypted, and I believe set your format in the dropdown to Bitcoin-QT format. You should then see address/private key pairs like so:
	{"addr" : "1ThisIsTotallyARealAddress1234",
	 "priv" : "5NoButSeriouslyItIsntSoDontSendAnythingToIt"},
Now what you can do is open Bitcoin-QT and go to Help, Debug Window,  Console. Now you can type in commands to import your private keys:
     importprivkey 5NoButSeriouslyItIsntSoDontSendAnythingToIt Label
The label is optional. I'm sure someone must have written something to import an exported wallet from blockchain by now if you have too many addresses to import by hand. I'll check Google in a bit if nobody else has responded. [Didn't find anything, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Maybe someone else will know.]
Edit to add: This shouldn't mess anything up, either, but in the end it might be easier to just send your funds from your blockchain.info wallet to a new address in Bitcoin-QT, unless you really need access to both for some reason!

There are infinite bitcoin exchanges, some just are a little better than others.
He'll probably lose his shirt trying this, depending how much he's planning to buy, because people are already doing it, and the fees and time delays involved make it pretty much a losing prospect for dabblers.
The proper way to do bitcoin arbitrage is to maintain funds on all exchanges simultaneously and then transfer as need be, so you can react instantly. The downside here is that if an exchange disappears, you lose everything that was on it, so you have to calculate risk vs payoff.

Fewer coins means each coin is worth a little more. In theory.
In the terrible worst case, an upgrade which every miner and wallet user uses could divide the last satoshi into 21 million more units, but that's both unlikely and around a hundred years away, as miners will continue to make coins for quite a while.

If mining ceases to be profitable enough, people will start to drop out. Once they drop out, mining will adjust to become easier, and thus more profitable.
If the bottom drops out and too many people leave, that's a concern, but the nice thing about ASICs is that you can't do anything else with them, so people are less likely to jump ship early.
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:07:17
Technically miners aren't "creating" more bitcoins; those coins already exist in the blocks that will be created, in predefined numbers, until the rewards stop. It's a small semantic argument, but all those bitcoins already exist, they just aren't in circulation yet. The blockchain is paying the miners for processing transactions from the bitcoin reserves, and eventually the reserves run out and the miners are rewarded just in fees.
@_date: 2013-03-13 15:06:29
The public key is the address, there is no difference.
If you create a private key through brute forcing or running words through a brainwallet algorithm, you can then convert that private key to the corresponding public key. Once you have the public key you can either search the blockchain for it or match it against whatever public key you were attempting to crack.
In reality you're unlikely to ever crack a random public key that hasn't been generated in an insecure manner (weak brainwallet passphrase, deterministic wallet, etc). 
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:32:06
I have no experience with using coinbase, sorry.
Multibit and possibly Bitcoin-Qt (can't recall at the moment) have a forced minimum fee. I think blockchain.info lets you specify a 0 fee if you really want to. They don't charge any fee themselves for normal use, but do charge a 0.5% fee for their mixing service. If you don't pay a transaction fee for your transactions, it could take days for the miners to include them at the moment.
As a warning, if you have a trojan, using TrueCrypt is the same as using nothing at all, since the second you mount the TrueCrypt drive to use MultiBit, the wallet will be stolen and you will be out all your bitcoins.

There's something like 30,000 preorders at this point; assuming you ever get your order, you will be behind a line that could eventually end in a 10x or 50x increase. People will continue to purchase ASICs until it is no longer massively profitable to do so. The best time to buy an ASIC was 6 months ago.
Also, from what I've read they have heavily missed the advertised power draw, and they also may be slightly below advertised hashrates.

Honestly I don't know; asking people to be their own bank is a lot of responsibility and easing them into the process, while in theory helpful, may sugar coat the gravity of things.
Even the concept of an autobackup isn't enough; only offsite backups are really useful, and offsite doesn't mean "my usb drive next to the keyboard" or "burned to a cd I keep on the shelf". How can you convince people to make sure they put their backups somewhere that will survive a gas mains explosion that destroys their home? The average person is a tech idiot, and I don't know how much hand holding would help vs harm them.
It's a noble goal, but I worry that in the end the person responsible for maintaining the software would get all the heat when grandma's house burns down and she loses her backup and forgot her password because it was written down on a pad of paper next to the computer which is also a pile of ash.
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:07:15
I've tried to make an analogy before where an address is like a post office box, and your private key lets you open that box and see what's inside. It sort of extends to the "anyone can put things in other people's post boxes but only people with the key can move something once it's inside". People seem to be able to understand this (or pretend they do) but it's hard to fit both mining and the actual concept of what a bitcoin "is" into that.

Keypairs are an aspect of [Public-key cryptography]( it allows verification that someone who claims to have written a message actually wrote the message without them needing to show the secret that would allow people to duplicate it. I imagine the address aspect of bitcoin is because public keys are long and terrible and would suck to have to communicate to people; normally public keys are accessed via some central server that is trusted to distribute them. Also I think bitcoin addresses have built in verification to prevent sending coins to invalid addresses (where they would be lost) and also some commonly confused characters are removed (confusing 0 with O for example). That said I'm no expert on the subject.
You can get [more info here]( on what the process to go from private key to address looks like if you're curious.

It's already very simple if you're familiar with the units; familiar with the metric system.
You can't force people to use your slang units; imagine if you went to another country and told people to give you a sawbuck, or a nickel. Slang currency terms happen organically.
If you want more slang terms, invent them and start using them. Look at satoshi, look at bitcent, they get used and so people use them. The metric units are there because they are **unconfusing**, you cannot confuse them, because they are a standard. The slang terms will grow and will be confusing until they are settled in.

I'm not sure if the Bitcoin-Qt client does any sort of consolidation automatically. If instead of sending small transactions to satoshidice, you sent a 1.5 BTC transaction to a friend, the bitcoins would then be consolidated for your friend. You can also send all your bitcoins to a new address you own manually if you're concerned. There is a good reason to do this if you wanted to move to new wallet software, etc, rather than importing all your old keys you can just send everything to the new wallet. There's also some mandatory fees involved if you're sending lots and lots of small inputs to a single address, but the mechanics of this fee elude me, it has to do with number of transactions, size of transactions, and I think days since the coins have moved. Lots of low value inputs are called "dust" I think.
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:17:50
The miners aren't really "in charge", but they do filter out impossible transactions. If nobody filters out impossible transactions, then there is no reason someone couldn't just create a transaction between two addresses they own creating coins out of thin air, and mining blocks until it's included in the chain. You say the recipient has access to the records, but you can keep sending coins between addresses you own until the recipient no longer can see those "secure" records where you created the coins from nothing. What would stop that?

Actually as a miner on a pool, you currently get so little information (using getwork) that it would be nearly impossible for you to be responsible. More likely it would be the pool owner they go after.

Send all coins from one address to address 1WhateverBleh, with no fee. Now send them again to 1SomewhereElse, with a fee. There are now two transactions floating around for that address; until one is included in the blockchain, both are technically valid. One will be written to the chain, and then the other will become invalid. You can custom craft transactions and send them to nodes that you know or suspect are connected to your target, and then send the +fee transaction slightly later but directly or nearly directly to a mining pool. The +fee transaction sent to a pool is more likely to be written to the chain, and the no fee discarded; if you completed your transaction based on 0 confirmations, you're now out of luck.
(Also, even 1+ confirmations could become invalid without too much hassle, assuming the spender can write a longer chain for the transaction they want to succeed faster than the rest of the network can; much easier with 51% or more of the processing power, but due to the random nature of finding blocks, still possible with lower values, albeit not as often.)
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:29:32
Mining processes transactions as well. If everyone stopped mining, no bitcoins would change hands. The mining reward is to encourage miners to actually mine while the amount of transactions are low; in theory, as more people use bitcoin, more transactions will occur, which means more fees to pay miners, so it becomes it's own reward.

Shut down bitcoin-qt and locate the wallet.dat it created when you first ran it (should be in something like c:\users\yourusername\appdata\roaming\bitcoin). Delete this wallet.dat and copy your backed up one into the directory.
If you have sent any coins to this new bitcoin installation DO NOT DELETE THE CURRENT WALLET.DAT. There is no easy way that I know of to merge wallets, so you may have to use a third party client to sweep the coins to your new installation.

There is no good way to include data in the blockchain; the easiest way is to craft addresses that contain the hex values of the data you want to insert and send satoshis to them all in a single transaction. If you have to store a lot of data, you need to send a lot of satoshis to a lot of addresses. It's impossible to stop this; even if we removed numbers and hex characters, people could just use an encoding scheme to use whatever letters *are* allowed. Literally impossible to stop. The upside is that the data is not a file; it's a string of crazy bullshit that you need special tools to pull back out. It seems unlikely anyone would care.
It might be easier to insert raw hex values into mined blocks, which is something you can already do, but the space available for it is rather small; you'd have to mine a lot of blocks to store anything, so even this seems like a stupid way to do it, and it would cost a lot of money to do so (since you'd have to be mining the blocks solo, or be a pool owner).
Basically it's a nonissue and there is no fix. If the government decides that sending special text which can be decoded into illegal data over the internet is a crime in and of itself, then no site will be able to allow users to post text anymore, because all text on every website could at any point have illegal data encoded into it, if you have the tools to encode it and then pull it back out. Even if this is the case, everyone in the country that makes it illegal could just switch to a thin client wallet. Seriously though, it's not going to happen.
Edit: Also, think of this scenario: I make a file full of 7 gigs of random data, and distribute this file. Then people make tools to recreate copyrighted content by grabbing the data at specific chunks and recombining it into copyrighted material. Would you then expect the 7 gig file of random data to be subject to a takedown request? What if instead of random data, we used the ISO for a popular linux distribution? You can recreate files out of any data as long as you have a program which can pull the data out at the right parts and recombine it; the program is the infringing tool, not the data.

In theory you could have two wallets, one secured with a passphrase and kept as your "cash", and the other secured with two passphrases kept as your savings. When your change runs out you would have to transfer the funds manually to your "cash" wallet. People already do something similiar to this, with "cold storage" or "paper wallets". There is currently no straightforward and secure way to do this if you're not at least partially technically inclined, as far as I know, but I imagine at some future point someone will make this process easier.

If the origin of the coins is the mining reward of a block, it would know it's a block reward. Some pools keep the block reward and split it, but I think some pools directly pay the reward to the miners? Maybe it tracks back one layer in either case? Not 100% sure, haven't updated yet, but it's pretty easy to know when coins come directly from a block reward.

The rigs from BFL are so fast/good because they don't exist in the real world. As far as I know they're still trying to actually make them, and they may eventually deliver, but they're still way over the original power specs, so if you didn't get your order in 7 months ago you may never break even.
DIY miners are not custom designed mining chips, they're GPUs or FGPAs. Custom designed chips will be faster because they cannot do anything else; they are designed to be as fast as possible and completely useless for anything else ever again.
It depends on how you define "scam". They haven't yet delivered in 7+ months, but they haven't run away with the profits. They could just be inept. If they end up delivering, it will be at the end of a long, painful road, but it won't be a scam.

If you are offline and then destroy the install completely (either boot from a livecd or wipe the drive and reinstall) you are very safe overall, since the most likely issue would be logging via the code reporting back to the server somehow.
This isn't completely foolproof though, since in theory the code you use to generate the wallet could be compromised somehow so that it gives you one of X number of pregenerated addresses based on your input; it would look to you like you were typing in a passphrase and getting an address for it, but you would really be typing in a passphrase and then getting out an address the thief controls. Once you put coins into it, they would likely scoop them right back out into an account they alone control.
As far as I know, this second scenario hasn't occurred in the wild, and it wouldn't impact current clean backups of bitaddress.

Assuming you can trust the special block to not be poisoned, by way of it being hardcoded into the client, technically I assume yes. It would need the balance for all active addresses though, and I'm not sure you can maintain that into an indefinite future of X hundred million addresses with a balance (possible, if unlikely).
The biggest reason is that it's not part of the spec to do so, really. For now people who don't want to store the blockchain just use light wallets like electrum or multibit.

Repost from an earlier question that was roughly the same:
The point of the hashing algorithm used for Bitcoin (and all cryptocoins afaik) is that it is difficult to compute, but very easy to verify. This allows mining to work as it does; it takes time to find a valid block, but once someone does, everyone can verify it in a fraction of the time.
With a scientific effort like folding the problem is that it's usually hard to verify a result; a lot of the time the same work is sent to multiple clients to weed out cheaters (people cheat at things like folding they send garbage data to get a higher hash rate.) and then if you get X% returned as matching and interesting, someone from the project will look into the results in more detail to verify something interesting is there. There's no way to make this work in a decentralized fashion like the blockchain does.
Would it be possible to create a centralized cryptocurrency that uses scientific work as the mining process? Quite possibly yes, but I don't know if it would have quite the adoption of Bitcoin.
Also, there is no increased need in hashing power to create coins at all. The total coins and the time they are released would be the same if the whole network was run on a single computer in someone's basement. The point of the increased power is increased security, because it requires more power for someone to take over the network.

A deterministic thin-client type wallet, like electrum, is friendlier in both 1 and 4.
For 2, it also needs a "Forgot you passphrase?" link where they type their dog's name, Fluffy, to undo the security we forced them to use before they were involved at all and they just picked a passphrase out of their ass and immediately forgot it, losing access to all their bitcoins forever.
For 3, I don't even know what you're saying. It would check if any transactions anywhere had ever gone to every address you type and warn you if not? And if they had, it would tell you who owns it? Who decides the truth of who owns what address? How is it verified?
You're basically creating an online wallet at this point, and those already exist.
@_date: 2013-03-13 19:01:37
Yes, these are all really good points to mention, and I did do sort of a disservice to gloss over them in an effort to provide a quick answer. There are a lot of interesting features within the design of bitcoin that can be a bit much to try to explain when you feel like you're trying to get across the basics; I would hope anyone who feels they have a grasp of "how bitcoin works" would end up looking deeper to appreciate all the little things.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:31:43
I assume you are attempting to send from Bitcoin-Qt; if this is the case, you used the "Encrypt Wallet" functionality and typed a password/passphrase in at that time. You need to type that in again to unlock the wallet for spending.
If you've forgotten this password/passphrase, the coins are lost. Depending on complexity and how much you remember, it may be possible to brute force. The more complex and the less you remember, it may not be possible to brute force within the lifetime of the universe.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:58:28
Each address has a private key that controls the bitcoins in that address. This is an analogy I've used before:
The blockchain contains many lockboxes, and your keys allow you to open those boxes and take what's inside them out and move them around to other boxes. I guess it's like post office boxes, maybe. The key unlocks the door, and it has a slot you can deposit things through. You can move coins out of any box you have the key to, and put them in any other box, whether you have the key or not.
All addresses already "exist", the trick is having the private key for them.

The values are stored on the blockchain, not in your wallet. The wallet contains the private keys that let you send bitcoin values from the addresses they are in. The reason to back up your wallet every so often is because many clients use "change addresses" to send leftover amounts from your transactions to, in order to obfuscate your activity. Your backups will not contain the "new" change addresses that get generated when you exhaust the current pool.
With Bitcoin-Qt the pool is 100 addresses, so you should probably back up the wallet every 50 transactions, including creating new addresses as a transaction.

Sheesh, I never pay above 0.0005 and that's when I want faster first confirmation. 0.0001 is usually fine if you don't absolutely need the very next block.
Try having less inputs in your transactions maybe? Do you deal with a lot of dust?
Edit: That said, you have a point in that the fees are "way lower" from a different angle, in that they aren't really a sliding scale like most other money transfers; it's not percentage or bracket based, so sending a 1 input transaction for 0.1 BTC is the same to the network as a 1 input transaction for 1000 BTC, and you'd expect the same fee to reasonably transfer both. But for very small transactions or very dust heavy ones, yes the fee can get pretty high, relative, for completing the transaction in a reasonable time.

It was possible in the past to assign an impossible condition as the requirements to respend a transaction using a specially constructed script. I don't know if this is still possible.
People have mentioned sending to an address nobody holds the key for, but that's not destroying them, since in the future some weakness could be found that lets anyone get the key for any address; the Bitcoin protocol could be updated to account for this, but I imagine any coins left unspend in "pre-upgrade" addresses would then be respendable.

Trying to recover wallets is a bit like any other file recovery. There are specialized tools, and there are even ways to build your own tools, but right now there's not much for "point and click" recovery.
I'd recommend finding someone trustworthy to do the recovery for you; your best bet with that is probably bitcointalk.org. You'd need to hand over the wallet.dat to someone, but as a last resort your only real choices are "sit and wait and hope someone builds recovery software" or "hope I find someone trustworthy to try to recover them for me". I'd offer to try for you, but I have no way to prove I am trustworthy, and in your place I wouldn't give me the wallet.
Going forward, I'd go with an automated backup solution. Best of luck to you!

It doesn't involve *all* coins on the address, just the total of the coins used as inputs. It's a small but important distinction. For example, if you have 1 BTC sent to your address as two 0.5 BTC transactions, and you send 0.25 BTC to a friend, you'd end up with a transaction sending 0.25 to your friend and 0.25 to a change address (pretending no fees, of course). Sorry to nitpick!

You can't currently encrypt multibit wallets as far as I know, which is quite a big deal in my mind. The risk is that someone puts a trojan on your machine, steals your wallet, and sweeps all your bitcoins to some other address they control.

The problem in my mind is that the cards would either need to be centrally released by spending the mining reward to a redeeming address, or the clients would need to know ahead of time what cards each block gives, so that they all agree you have the cards as the reward from block X. Bitcoins are just numbers, and the reward for mining is a function of the code; when you mine a block, you get # of coins which is based on a calculation of the number of coins per block at the start, decreased by half each X blocks, calculated against the current block height. None of this contains any actual useful information that could turn the reward into a unique card or set of cards. If you have to know ahead of time when a block contains a good reward or a bad one, not as many people would be interested in wasting the time mining a crappy block, and so block times would be all over the place. It would be a lot easier to do something centrally controlled, but bitcoin is sort of designed to not be centrally controlled, so you'd probably be better off starting from scratch.

The json wallet can be re-imported by blockchain.info, of course, and I know MultiBit can import them as well, perhaps other clients too. Bitcoin-QT isn't really fully featured, but if you wanted to, you could manually import the private keys from an unencrypted blockchain.info wallet backup as well.
If you want to keep a backup, you should probably be backing up an encrypted version, so that if it gets compromised somehow, there's still a password needed to get the private addresses out.
The json is basically a list of bitcoin address / private key, and private keys are all anyone needs to be able to spend the bitcoins associated with that address. A wallet.dat is basically the same thing, a list of private keys, which lets you spend funds, it's just not in a plaintext format like a json file is.

Mining is trying to find a 256 bit hash with a certain number of 0s at the front. It's basically like trying to brute force a very very very large pool of wallets until you get a private key that matches one of them.

Assuming you consider "securing the bitcoin network" as "not useful" (which many people do) and are thinking of something like Folding or the like, then no, it's not possible.
The proof of work in Bitcoin is hard to do (find a specific type of hash) but very very easy to verify (run the now known input through SHA-256 and get the same result). Distributed computing programs like Folding or SETI rely on work that is "easy" to do but tough to verify; it would just lead to people spamming invalid results to the projects in massive numbers to get the most rewards, and pretty much ruin them.
There is PrimeCoin, which apparently does some work finding primes instead of SHA-256, but I'm not sure how "useful" that is; probably in the eye of the beholder.

ETA: I think people are confused when they say you can "counterfeit" bitcoins. Technically you can't "forge" a bitcoin, but you could fake some part of a non-blockchain transaction to fool some people. You could print a paper wallet that has a different QR code for the address than the actual private key resolves to. I suppose you could also create fake Casascius coins. This could be considered a form of counterfeit.
You could also, for example, claim to send someone bitcoins and give them a link to a fake blockchain.info type site with the transaction confirmed - maybe they would fall for it and send you the money, assuming the problem is at their end. This is already possible with regular currency though, and nobody calls it counterfeiting.

Yes, but each send returns change to a new change address. It's easier to say 100 transactions, because change addresses confuse people.

A valid question, I had assumed that getaddressesbyaccount would show change addresses, possibly in error. You can try to **dumpprivkey 15GoDKid4X25yLEErS4b6gPQeqfcJVRJLa** and if you get the private key back it would at least prove you own it. I'll see if I can dig anything up on viewing change addresses.
Edit: If you *do* get the private key back, can you do **getaccount 15GoDKid4X25yLEErS4b6gPQeqfcJVRJLa** and see what it says?

Sure in theory that could happen, you'd be better off printing from a printer directly attached to your machine while it's not onine, and also using a livecd that doesn't connect to the internet and is rebooted directly after, and then destroy the printer.
It's a bit more secure than an online wallet in theory because it only exists to intercept for a certain period of time, depending on how the printer works. Unfortunately it won't be encrypted, so it's much more vulnerable during this time.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:41:13
In Bitcoin-Qt click Help / Debug window, then click on the Console tab and type in **getaddressesbyaccount ""**. That should list all your receiving addresses, including change addresses. Check if that address is in the list.
Edit: To expand, the transaction you see is (I assume) you betting 0.01 on satoshidice, and the unspent change from the transaction going back to a change address in your wallet. Bitcoin-Qt uses change addresses because the original design calls for them to increase anonymity, but it means you can't view your actual balance on sites like blockchain.info because your coins are no longer in the original address.

Tor is a very good example; by running a tor node you could be relaying packets for someone who is getting around government censorship, or, you could be relaying packets for someone looking at child pornography. You have no way of knowing which; it could be both, or neither. How do you determine the morality?
I suppose you could take a hardline stance that because it enables immoral uses, the bad cannot outweigh the good; many would disagree with you though. In the end, it's just a technology, and if it gets shut down, both use cases will move on to a new venue.

In all honesty, it would likely be easier to start an alternate chain than to change the bitcoin protocol. Any attempt to implement mining past the 21,000,000 limit would be met with severe resistance at the current time, and in the future (assuming wide adoption) it would require all infrastructure to be upgraded or else the new blocks would be invalid to any unupgraded client/miner and a hard fork would occur. This would have the effect of meaning all bitcoins would exist at the same time on both chains, and transactions would only happen on one or the other, with no way to reconcile them, assuming heavy use and an ever growing split.

If you get it before it's worthless, then yes, it's worth it. If not, then it isn't.
There's no way to actually tell you if it's worth it or not, because it's a gamble; BFL has been delayed on shipping for like 12 months now, and perpetually is shipping in *two weeks*. You'll still find people preordering as well, so you're behind anywhere from 25k to 50k orders, with no way to know how long that will take or what impact it will have on the hashrate.
In addition, other companies are selling ASICs, chips, and bringing their own miners online, further impacting the difficulty. You may make your money back, and you may not. It's a total gamble, and anybody who claims it's a sure thing but isn't 100% invested in BFL ASICs is just a blowhard.

The client used to connect to an IRC channel and find nodes from there to connect to; I think that's now changed and it gets a seed list from the bitcoin website possibly? I'm not 100% on that. In any case it gets a list of starting peers and then once it can connect to one of those, it can learn about the peers they know, connect to them, repeat forever.
I think it also keeps a list of discovered peers, so it really should only need the seed list one time, unless all the peers it knows about are unreachable.

I'm not sure why value would decrease if they're being produced at the same rate, which they will be since difficulty will rise to match the speed of the ASICs. I suppose there's a lag between when they come online and when difficulty goes up, but difficulty will continue to rise until it is no longer vastly profitable to purchase an ASIC, and then we'll be right back where we are now.

They can't "decree the truth"; what they *can* do is choose not to include blocks mined by any other miners, and double spend any coins they own, and also refuse to include transactions people make. They can't create infinite coins out of thin air (although they would get all the rewards for all blocks they mine) or steal anyone else's coins.
The mitigation is to have a lot of power on the network, so that the cost to reach 51% is more than the benefit, and in fact is probably better off contributing legitimately, since you would get more in block rewards than you would get double spending, since people would stop accepting transactions during the attack.
There is no bulletproof mitigation though, it's killed a few smaller cryptocoins already.

Most people (as in, the majority, being average users) probably keep their wallet on their computer, hopefully encrypted but probably not.
Bitcoin-Qt offers wallet encryption, as does Armory, but both require the whole blockchain to be downloaded.
Electrum and Multibit do not require the blockchain download, but only Electrum allows wallet encryption in a non-beta version of the software. There are some possible privacy issues with Electrum due to the need to query transaction history each addresses, but this is the tradeoff for not download the blockchain. I'm not 100% sure how Multibit works as far as the compact blockchain or if it has the same issues.

If any of those devices hit the market at the end of April I'll eat a giant hat.
Aside from that, bitcoins are produced at a constant rate, currently 25 every 10 minutes. If a bunch of ASICs came online, they would be produced faster for somewhere between 1 and 2016 blocks, at which point difficulty would jump, and then repeat that until 10 minutes is the average again.
Bitcoins will either go up, come down, or stay the same because of this.

Code -4 is probably because the wallet is encrypted and you need to unlock it first.

As I said in my original post:


@_date: 2013-04-25 18:48:07
Valid question, I'm not sure there's a consensus. It's not "the Bitcoin", and the currency aspect is usually BTC or ฿ or Ƀ; you can technically have "a bitcoin" (1 BTC) but that doesn't really "exist", it's just numbers in a ledger.
Since it's just numbers in a ledger, the terminology is pretty malleable. You can say "We accept bitcoins here!" or "We accept Bitcoin here!" and I think either would be valid. Most people would probably pluralize it to "bitcoins" if they weren't using BTC to denote an amount, as in "2.2 bitcoins" rather than "2.2 bitcoin". I think if you're referring to the concept of Bitcoin you'd capitalize it, but if you're referring to the units you'd use lowercase.
Someone else probably has completely different ideas though.

It seems like this would allow miners to create false transactions, by pretending a previous address sent funds it didn't actually contain into the current sender's wallet. How would any other clients verify coins were not created out of thin air?
Edit: I'm not saying a system like this couldn't be created; my point is that a system like this wouldn't be bitcoin. If you think people would desire/use a cryptocurrency like this, you're free to start an altchain; worst case is nobody uses it! (Well true worst case is everyone uses it and then it's found to be flawed somehow and everyone loses all their coins/security...)
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:06:34
Why would people mine to defend a currency they aren't involved in. If they were involved, why wouldn't they be mining already if they could? If they aren't mining, they don't believe it's worthwhile to do so, so why would they prop it up when it's clearly going to fail because of an attack too large to handle?
@_date: 2013-06-25 18:54:20
Less transactions means a smaller block, which means faster network transmission, in theory; if you can get your block out faster than another one solved at the same time, it's more likely to be used as the base for chain building, and thus you're more likely to be able to keep the reward.
It's also possible the miner's queue was low/empty for some reason, like a recently restarted software package or the like. It's really pretty much impossible to know *why* a miner did what they did without directly asking them.

A lot of the time, people in the bitcoin community seem to be fairly against banks, but banks provide a secure layer between people and their finances. Credit/Debit card fraud happens all the time, ATM skimming, etc, but because banks are insured and have the right systems in place, most of the time people don't have to worry their life savings are going to disappear. I assume that if bitcoins were going to be widespread, bitcoin banking would have to be a thing; many people can't really be trusted to take care of their own money in the digital age.

If that's an ad for butterfly labs, the downside is that they are 7 months or so behind on shipping anything at all, and if you *do* get your ASIC miner, you'd be behind a line of thousands of other people; once they get their ASICs online, network difficulty will skyrocket, possibly 50x or 100x even, and by the time you get your ASIC you may never make back your ROI.

They'd have a heck of a time proving you own any particular address though. Print a bunch of paper wallets, split the funds, hide the wallets somewhere; claim you were hacked, claim you sent the coins to someone for cash and they never delivered, etc etc. You can give up the private keys for the addresses you own, but you can't be forced to give up private keys to every address you've ever interacted with.

To attempt to simplify things, funds are basically allocated *per private key*; each private key has some amount of funds that belong to it, based on blockchain history. Most keys have 0 funds, because they have no history, or have been emptied. It's likely the vast majority of keys will never see any funds.
If bitcoins get sent to an address, those coins belong to anyone who holds the private key that creates (hashes to) that address. In your wallet, you have many addresses, each with their own private key. When you spend a bitcoin, the address' unique private key is writing a special message into the blockchain that says "I am the owner of this address, and I want to send the coins it has to these places."
*All* the coins in the address are spent every single time you send any of them. If you have an address that has 50 bitcoins in it, and you send 5 bitcoins to a friend, you actually create a message to the blockchain that says "Send 5 bitcoins from this address to my friend, and send 45 back to me." Any coins you don't account for are given to the miner that puts your transaction into the blockchain. All of this is transparent to you when you use a wallet, normally.
If you look at your wallet and see a balance of 100 bitcoins, this is the balance of all your individual private keys; it's very likely that you could have some addresses with 0 bitcoins, some with 10, maybe one has 50, but to make things easy for you, the wallet just says "You have 100!" If you wanted to you could use a wallet that lets you pick which address(es) you actually use when you send coins from every time you make a transaction.
Let me know if this makes any sense!
@_date: 2013-06-04 13:17:30
No, a mixing service would more likely be splitting up the transactions into varied amounts and addresses. Looks like someone is combining amounts into a single address. No way to know who or what owns that address though.

Actually the story of the devs could also be told as "The miners decided to go back to the old chain and the devs went with it." The devs could indeed make all kinds of crazy changes, but if the miners don't use the new code, nothing will happen.
The pools are in theory a concern, but I think after their first double spend everyone would abandon it.
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:17:15
The market isn't deep enough to cash out millions of bitcoins, and anybody could have bought up a crapload of bitcoins back when they were worthless, so if someone owns a super crapload it doesn't really matter, because cashing out will tank the price, and they won't get millions of dollars. If I had had a million coins I would have sold long before the crash at $30, because why would you hold all that cash unless you believed there was a real future in bitcoins?
Worst case is the economy gets tanked and people buy up cheap bitcoins because people always seem to want to buy cheap bitcoins and everything settles lower until the next crash or bubble.

Miners mine all day every day to make a profit. You may want to look at  to try to calculate how much money you're actually losing (unless you get free electricity). Most GPU miners have rigs with 4 cards, yes. GPU mining will die eventually when ASICs start to ship at a reasonable rate, probably when Avalon's second batch ships. Stale shares are shares sent for blocks that have been abandoned or solved already, I think. Basically you were too slow on the draw.
Also may be some help.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:08:05
To validate the private key works out to the public key, you need to have the private key, which means you've compromised the address, and now it's no good to anyone else.
If you check the public key's balance, you only know the balance right now, and cannot verify someone else doesn't have the private key (and since checking the private key is the only way to validate it, surely everyone else who has ever had the bill will have the key).
If I need to trade someone $5, I give them $5. I don't give them a token that is worth $5 as long as nobody else steals the value from it while he's sleeping. Who will he be mad at if that happens?

Mining is better explained as "processing transactions". There is a built in reward for doing so, and this is how bitcoins are created; the reward started at 50 bitcoins and halves at certain points. The reward is there now so that people will mine. Later on, when the reward is very small (or stops existing because it is less than a satoshi), transaction fees will reward the miners.
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:18:13

Changing it requires a hard fork. Some people don't think it should be changed because something something libertarian principles.
I honestly can't make sense of it, but I guess forcing a hard fork means you're violating the sovereignty of their bitcoins? Also the blockchain will grow too big according to some other people. It's a tempest in a teapot and I assume at some point the miners will decided it's needed so they can get more fees per block, and then we'll all have to update.
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:58:18
Nothing personal, but ideally you'd release the code, and/or have a warning that this requires complete trust that you won't just keep all the coins sent once you see a juicy enough transaction incoming.

@_date: 2013-05-14 07:08:01
Isn't shared send a mixing service used to hide where coins come from? It would explain why they've gone to some random address, and I guess there would be a delay while it waited for confirmations before you get some from somewhere else in the destination address.
Edit: Yeah,  says it's a mixing service. You send your coins away and then get random coins back in the address you entered. I imagine you'd get your coins eventually, minus the fee. Why would you need to mix coins you bought?

@_date: 2013-04-10 16:34:33
My attempt at a simple explanation:
The blockchain is a set of 2^160 bitcoin addresses like post office boxes; each address has a private key that can open it, these keys are stored in your wallet. Anyone can put bitcoins into any post office box through the slot, but only the owner of the key can then move the bitcoins out of it.
2^160 is a very large address space. It's unlikely on a cosmic scale for two people to have the same address in the lifetime of the universe.
Miners are transaction processors; the current protocol rewards people for processing transactions by giving them some amount of bitcoins every time they create a block. This number goes down until it is so small that it's less than the minimum amount of bitcoins you can own, and then they will get 0 bitcoins for their reward. However, they also get any fees assigned to the transactions they include in their blocks; b the time the reward goes to 0, the hope is that transaction fees will make up for this.
Let me know if any of this makes any sense!

In a world where butterfly labs could reach production targets and their machines performed to spec, difficulty would rise until it was no longer massively profitable to buy an ASIC.

There's some good info [here]( about double spending, there are a few attacks directly aimed at 1 confirmation. There is also the chance of side mining a chain that reverses the transaction; this requires 10% of the network hashrate to have a 0.1% chance at 6 confirmations. Obviously for only one confirmation the requirements are very reduced.
In the end, the number of confirmations can be weighed against your potential loss and the cost of reversing the transaction; exchanges can deal in fairly large amounts of coins and would be potentially a juicy target for a double spend if they took only a single confirmation.

What you've done is very confusing in the way you explained it. I'm assuming you just imported a private key into a blockchain.info wallet; if that's true, then you haven't moved any coins at all, you've just given the keys to the coins that were already in the address to some new software.
You could have your private key in a thousand different types of wallet software and it wouldn't need to show up on the blockchain until the coins are actually "spent".

Generating paper wallets online carries that risk, there is no way around it. At any point someone could do what you said, and until people notice it, it will compromise those keys.
That said, if you can save and use the files offline, from a live cd for example, where you never connect to the internet and the entire OS disappears when you restart, you can be reasonably confident in the integrity of the brainwallet.
However, there's no way to help people who are not good with security be secure. At best you can attempt to educate people, but people still give their money to nigerian princes.

It's not actually paper, but I get what you mean. My problem with your supposition that a dollar would still be worth the material it is made of (or any fiat currency) doesn't take into account the fact that you can't actually make use of the material, as doing so would (presumably) destroy the currency, and that is a crime. You can't melt down a penny for the copper, even though the copper in an older penny is worth more than 1 cent. If the government that backs the currency doesn't exist anymore, than really you're just trading rags and metal rounds; the currency aspect is still worthless.
That said, I wasn't really playing my answer straight.

A single address means that all your activity can be easily traced; some clients send the change to new addresses, which makes it harder to know when you're still in control of funds you send out, since any address in the transaction could be a change address, or none of them.

There are a very very large number of addresses, and the default setup of the client (using change addresses) would in many use cases mean that even *if* you generated an address someone else had used at some point, it would likely be empty now, and would never be reused again.
Change addresses are confusing for regular users though at the moment, so there's a bit of division in the community about the value of having them as the default.

BFL isn't a con at the moment, although they are 7 months behind on shipping anything and they have missed their power specs by a big margin last I had heard. If you buy now you will be behind an unknown amount of buyers with an unknown shipping time, putting you at a position somewhere between "very profitable" and "never get your money back". It's also possible other ASICs will come online before BFL is able to ship, raising the difficulty before you can even start, meaning you could end up in a position no better off investing in a GPU/FGPA rig and starting to mine today.
You could also make tons of money because they somehow are able to ship super fast and you get yours very quick and there is a low order total, and so you can crank out blocks before the difficulty is able to rise to meet the actual hashrate.
It's a gamble.

There are attacks that let you double spend on 0 confirmation transactions, so someone could send bitcoins, and then if the transaction id is a loser, send the bitcoins somewhere else with a higher fee and try again. If you don't know the secret in advance, you don't know if a transaction is a loser or winner until satoshidice tells you, but you can then confirm they aren't lying the next day.
Satoshidice has no influence on someone else's transaction id, so while they could attack their own game, knowing the secret, it would gain them nothing. At best it'd artificially inflate the win percentage, and any statistical analysis would show that they actually payout over the expected percentage.

Multibit doesn't generate change addresses like Bitcoin-Qt, so assuming you never add any new addresses, your backup should be all you need. If you ever generate a new address or import a new private key, you'll need a new backup.

They could force some kind of hard fork with a new hashing algorithm for finding blocks to try to make everyone's ASICs completely useless and totally ruin everyone's current setups, shaking faith in Bitcoin completely and leaving it an abandoned project.
Any altcoin (such as litecoin) which claims to have a fix for this is lying. Litecoin is the worst offender at current, it was originally "GPU Resistant!" and then better GPUs came along with more memory, so now it's "ASIC Resistant!" but there's nothing stopping someone from making a scrypt focused ASIC with a ton of memory; nothing except cost-to-profit ratios. If litecoin suddenly became super valuable because everyone could mine it, ASICs would appear and nobody would be able to mine it.
The only "solution" I can think of would be some kind of altcoin that uses multiple types of hashing algorithms per block, but again, that's just raising the bar for how much upfront money it costs to make a crazy profitable machine. At some point, assuming wide enough adoption, the tipping point would occur and everyone without the money to do so would be pushed out.

I forgot that you can specify a block reward to multiple addresses directly, so it seems likely that the first transaction would need to be verified before the block is seen as valid. I was just assuming that in an event where the block reward goes to a single address, there's no need to verify it until the first spending, since the value can only ever be the reward + fees. With the ability to split it, it would need to be verified as valid before you can accept it, so you're most likely right.

You could export the private key, but if you do that, and you lose your wallet, you will never be able to recover the funds unless you also keep a backup of the private key somewhere. Electrum has deterministic wallets, but imported private keys are not regenerated.
Depending on if you have a billion change addresses or not, it could also be super tedious. You could always import the wallet into a blockchain.info account and send without a fee if you don't need access to the funds for a few days.
If you want some instructions for exporting your private key from Bitcoin-Qt let me know.

As far as I know, using current wallet software, yes I believe this to be the case, however I'm not fully versed in how all wallets handle change addresses; it's possible some wallet software could drop control of change addresses at some point if they contain 0 BTC, meaning any funds sent back to them would be lost. This would be poor design, but I am not intimately familiar with the inner workings of all wallet software currently on the market.
It's also possible bitcoins could be moved from a cold storage wallet to a wallet on a livecd, and then sent from the wallet on the livecd; in this case, if the coins were sent rather than the private key imported, it's possible that the private key for the livecd wallet would be lost when the machine was rebooted, as the address was only being used for temporary storage of bitcoins.
It's never truly safe to assume someone has control of an address; if you are wrong, there is no way to unsend the coins, and so both you and the intended recipient would be out of luck.

Which private key do you want? Multibit and Bitcoin-Qt will have seperate ones, and Electrum will give you another set.
Bitcoin-Qt also generates change addresses so much of your money will be spread across a pool of ever changing private keys.
You don't really need to know your private key in most circumstances, just protect your wallet files. Bitcoin-Qt allows encryption, Multibit allows you to kiss your money goodbye if your computer is compromised, and I believe electrum does encryption as well, on top of that electrum's address generation is deterministic so you could recreate your wallet from the seed if you lose everything.

Well honestly I'm out of ideas right now; I assume you recognize the transaction from the original address to satoshidice, so the rest of it should be change. It looks like after the first spend, another bet was made and the bulk went to another address, again likely as change, and then a 0.00005 BTC transaction was deposited into the 15GoDKid address (some sort of winnings or something from satoshidice? I don't actually use it so I'm unsure how it works). I would imagine since there is still BTC in the address, Bitcoin-Qt would still have the private key for it so that it can be spent. My last thought would be to use [pywallet]( to dump the wallet and have a look, but beyond that, I'd need to (I guess) dig more into how the hell Bitcoin-Qt handles change addresses and at the moment I don't have time to do so.

[Public Key Crypto]( is pretty well established at this point in time; the wikipedia article should be a reasonable place to start reading.
The "equation" for mining is basically people attempting to get an [SHA256]( hash with a "target" of X number of leading zeroes. The [block hashing algorithm]( is basically a verification of the data within the block; if you have the block data, you can easily verify that the contents match the hash. The hard part is generating a hash that meets the current difficulty requirements (number of leading 0s); miners can add a [nonce]( basically a random number, to the input, and then try hashing all the data and seeing what comes out the other end. They keep retrying with new nonces over and over until either they win, and they submit their block, or someone else wins, and they have to start over using the new block as the base. [The necessary number of 0s is self-adjusting]( and is recalculated every 2016 blocks based on the speed of those blocks. If they have been faster than once every 10 minutes on average, difficulty goes up; if not, difficulty goes down. In this way the speed of the network is self-limited.
I linked the SHA-2 article above, you can find more info there. If SHA256 is broken, it will be a much bigger issue for the world than just the security of the blockchain.
The [blockchain]( is a ledger of all transactions; it verifies all inputs and outputs exist, and come from real sources (mining rewards). It prevents people from creating coins out of nothing, or creating invalid transactions, or spending coins multiple times. It's what ultimately secures bitcoin transactions; you can be fairly sure that if it's in there, it's valid. The deeper in it is, the more sure you can be.
As to your last question, bitcoins are the case study in deflationary currency. There's no real world example to lean on; just economists arguing. Some people believe it can be, some believe it can't, but it all comes down to human nature, and sadly that can be pretty hard to nail down in real life.

Pretty good, yes, although the address doesn't need to be generated; technically it already exists in the form of a 160 character hash. All addresses exists simultaneously, they just may not have been assigned any coins yet. Any amount of coins can be assigned to be spendable only by a certain hash, and so they remain untouched until the person with the key for that hash moves them again. It's possible to track any amount of bitcoin through the list of reassignment back to the block it was mined from.

The problem with ASIC calculations is that there is no way to know the actual difficulty changes once (if) they start shipping on a large scale. Everyone with even a passing interest in mining can use those calculators and see the apparently insane ROI, and I imagine people will buy ASICs until they stop being profitable; which means until either bitcoins crash in price, or until difficulty is something like 100 times higher. Your best bet is to buy one in the past, anything else is pretty much a gamble.

This idea is impossible as near as I can tell with the way Bitcoin currently works. The text is too convoluted to really follow 100%, but there is no way to stop a private key from spending coins assigned to the public address it hashes to within the current protocol.
A wallet is just a list of strings that let you spend all the coins. If you have the string, you have the coins, it doesn't matter what the wallet software does, because you can bypass the software. As long as you can decode the string from the wallet, you own the coins.

No, probably not; Litecoin was originally designed to be mined on CPUs, as Bitcoin was, but Bitcoin's hashing algorithm benefits greatly from using a GPU, whereas the increase for Litecoin is not as great, by design.

You don't need to stay online once your transaction is seen by the network, but you will need to download the whole 7+gig blockchain with Bitcoin-Qt/Armory.
[Electrum]( can be a good choice for a wallet that doesn't require the whole blockchain downloaded; technically an electrum server can (I believe) know that your IP owns a particular address, so there's some privacy concerns, but that's the tradeoff I guess.
Multibit also doesn't require a whole blockchain download, but the non-beta version doesn't encrypt your wallet, which means if it gets stolen, all your bitcoins are going to be gone.
MtGox and Coinbase are not really online wallets; blockchain.info is pretty good in how their security is set up, if you enable 2 factor authentication and have a secure passphrase, but no online wallet is perfectly secure, just as no computer is perfectly secure.
I use the Bitcoin-Qt client with an encrypted wallet.dat, but I have plenty of hard drive space and no need to worry about network use. I've used multibit for testing and it's fast to get going but sort of clunky. I've also used Electrum and would probably reccomend that client to people who don't want to download the blockchain.
I've also used blockchain.info and can recommend them if you need a wallet you can access easily from many places. Just make sure to enable two factor authentication.

It would become very unprofitable, as it would take weeks to months to mine a single block, and anywhere between 1 and 2016 blocks would need to be mined to start the difficulty going down. It can also only drop or increase by a quarter of the current difficulty at most I believe, so it would take a very very long time for block time to reach 10 minutes again. That said I can't really imagine a situation where 99% of miners just stop mining.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:01:04
Yes to both. Average block time is pegged to ~10 minutes, and most clients see 6 confirmations as a completed transaction. This means on average you will have your coins ready to spend in an hour. Some clients allow spending on fewer confirmations, but I don't have info for that readily available.

All bitcoin addresses already "exist", they just don't have any funds assigned to them. A private key lets you respend funds assigned to an address on the blockchain. You can send funds to any valid address, it's possible to send bitcoins to [an address that nobody has the key for]( and [will probably never have the key for]( Paper wallets are just you making a key and then sending funds to the associated address so you can unlock it later.

Exchanges hook up buyers and sellers. Each coin sold is sold to a buyer. Each coin bought is bought from a seller. The reason the price would crash in a megadump situation is that all the outstanding buy orders are filled, and not enough people want to buy at higher prices. Your coins are worth less and less the more you sell them; at some point you'll either stop selling, or start to lose money, assuming you didn't obtain the coins for free.
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:38:58
You can already do that. You can generate every possible address forever and ever until the heat death of the universe in the hopes that you generate an address that already has some coins in it.
Any profit you could make doing this is outweighed by using the same machine to mine instead.
In the future it might be possible, assuming SHA2 is cracked or a weakness is found in Bitcoin's specific implementation, but those are bigger, separate issues.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:36:33
It goes to the miners if you don't use a client or transaction creator that sends the change back to the paper wallet or some other address.
Something like  sends the change back to the original address, and some other wallets do as well. The Bitcoin-Qt client uses change addresses, and so the balance would go to a new address in that client's wallet. Some other clients use change addresses as well.
Edit: You wouldn't take a paper wallet to the store; allowing anyone to see the private key of the paper wallet would make it completely insecure to ever use it again.
@_date: 2013-03-13 15:27:42
Each public key has it's own private key, 1 to 1 (this may not be 100% true as some public keys may have duplicate private keys, but the amount is negligible); the reason you can have "infinite" addresses in your wallet is because there are 2^160 (2 to the 160th power) possible bitcoin addresses. Each address in your wallet is just a private key/public key pair; your private key allows you to publish a signed message to the blockchain that the coins that have been allocated to that address are being moved somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:53:37
There are some seed nodes you get when you download the client, and the Bitcoin-Qt client used to connect to IRC to get seed nodes as well, I assume there is a fallback somewhere in the event that you can't see any of the nodes in your current peer list, probably a download from the bitcoin site, it would really depend on the client you use.
@_date: 2013-06-27 14:09:13
There's no such thing as "a bitcoin", and there's no easy way to answer. Technically it's possible to send a transaction for free; people do it all the time, but it requires your inputs to not exceed certain rules which force a fee (I think the forced minimum for some transactions is currently 0.0001 BTC, but I could be mistaken). The tradeoff for no fee transactions is that it could take a long time for them to be confirmed (at worst it could be a couple of days but it's usually just a handful of hours, I believe).
I believe many people probably pay somewhere from 0.0001 to 0.0005 BTC per transaction though, just as incentive to the miners to include their transactions quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:49:31
It's more reaching in your pocket to take out your wallet and pulling out someone else's instead, full of cash.
It probably illegal to use the cash, or immoral at least, but if the wallet has no identifying info, the best you could do is hand it in at a police station; you can't even do that with a bitcoin address.
Also, in the real world, [lost wallets have rules about them]( whereby eventually someone else can claim ownership. How would this apply to stumbling over someone else's brain wallet? I have no idea.
What it really comes down to is that people are in large part immoral and you should pick a damn strong passphrase with many bits of entropy for your brainwallet, lest you lose all your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:50:39
As digitalh3rmit said, even if 51% changed the rules, nobody else would even see transactions on the new fork, because the blocks wouldn't be valid. In order to use the new blocks, your client would need to see them as valid as well. This isn't quite true for thin clients, like electrum, or web based wallets, so technically they could be coerced to respect the new rules, but then you wouldn't even really need 51% of the network.
It's not trust based for most cases, the biggest issue for 51% attacks is that the attacker could reverse their own spends, because they control more hashing power than the rest of the network, they can rewrite history by writting a bigger valid blockchain faster than the rest of the network.

Double spending is when two transactions try to spend the same input; if hypothetical people Alice and Bob both have a wallet with the same address in it, and the address has 0.5 bitcoins in it, and then both Alice and Bob try to send that 0.5 bitcoins, that's a double spend. Once one of the transactions gets included in a block, the other transaction becomes invalid. It's possible for both of them to be included in separate blocks, but eventually when the longest chain wins, one of them will be tossed as invalid.
It's also possible for your transaction to disappear from memory after a while, either because whatever pool it was floating around in was restarted, or I think you can set some kind of built in expiration time, but don't quote me on that. In any case, transactions will always eventually be included in a block or lost from the network, in which case they will be undone; it's not really possible to "lose" bitcoins forever to an unconfirmed transaction.

Did you ever get this sorted?

MultiBit uses a different form of blockchain, I'm not 100% on the specifics, but I think it uses a version without the transactions, just the headers, to save on space, so it's like 22mb vs 7gb. This is way faster, but it doesn't allow as much independent verification of the blockchain for the user.
As to blockchain.info saying you have more in your wallet than multibit does, I can't say. The reverse is usually the case, due to change addresses.

If you don't specify the change going back to the originating address, and you don't send all funds used as inputs, any unassigned "change" goes to the miners as the transaction fee.
So for example if you have a 100 BTC input and you're spending 50 BTC from it, you have to either specify the remaining 50 BTC as going back to the sending address or to another address you control; if you don't, then you will have sent 50 BTC with a 50 BTC transaction fee.

Addresses have a checksum which verifies they are valid. You can't send coins to an invalid address. What you can do is send them to a script (technically addresses are also just a script) which says "The sender has to be able to meet these conditions" (normally that's "own the private key who's public key hashes to this value") and instead of being a hash, it could be (I think) OP_FALSE, which is not something any private key can hash to. They removed some of the available script words at some point though, so I'm not sure what's possible anymore.
Even if you sent them to "a random valid address", it is theoretically possible someone could control the address at some point, unleashing all the "destroyed" bitcoins back into circulation. This is not a secure method for building a new currency on.
Edit: Yeah, OP_FALSE, check out [this transaction]( around 500 BTC destroyed. If you scroll down you can see the script that explains who can respend the coins; one has a hash160, the other has OP_FALSE. Basically destroyed barring some kind of massive protocol change.
Also, I fail to see a way this could be decentralized. Who decides a bitcoin is actually destroyed, and when? I suppose you have miners running both the BTC blockchain and the new blockchain in parallel, looking for "destroyed" coins, but how does it decide who to reward them *to*? It can't give them to the address that sent them unless it uses the exact same address format as bitcoin, and if it does that you're in for a terrible world of confusion.

Any paper wallet you import to Bitcoin-QT should be considered dead. Without coin control you have no way to specify what address you're spending from and no control over where it goes to. Your change *will* return to Bitcoin-QT, but what address it ends up in is anyone's guess.
You could use something like blockchain.info to specify the change goes back to the paper wallet, but doing so isn't very safe either, since once you've typed your private key into an internet enabled device, it's possible the key has been compromised.
Basically, unless you're using an airgapped setup, where you generate the raw transaction on a device with no internet connection and push it from a separate internet connected device, you should consider all paper wallets "one time use" for spending.

Who enforces the 1 satoshi per block?
Can I register each core of my ASIC/GPU as a separate miner?
Do pool operators get no votes if they aren't mining, or one vote, even if no one uses the pool, or all the votes?
Does everyone who contributed any work to a block on a pool get a vote, even if they only contribute one result per block? What if that result is invalid?
Who cares what the miners say; the fees are their reward. If nobody uses a new client that follows whatever rules they decide on, they get fucked anyway. Plus, who forces all the miners who vote against a passed proposal to use the new protocol? Nobody, that's who.

Backup your wallet.dat somewhere safe. Restart Bitcoin-QT. Ideally, find bitcoins in wallet.
Failing that, you can import your wallet.dat to a blockchain.info account and see what happens.

Honestly in my experience MultiBit screws up a lot. It needs blockchain resetting every few days sometimes. It also still doesn't encrypt the wallet, AFAIK, so if your machine is compromised your coins are gone. If I really wanted a lite client, I would be using electrum. As for your questions:
1) See above.
2) You only really need to backup the exported key file; you can recreate your wallet with that just fine.
3) If the private key file is encrypted with a strong passphrase, there's no real worry. If the computer *was* compromised, they could just steal the unencrypted wallet.
4) See above re: resetting the blockchain.

Playing satoshi dice causes you to have tons of tiny value inputs in your addresses, which bloats your transaction sizes. There's a minimum quoted in the spec for transactions with a high size (lots of inputs) and a low age (recently received) that you *can* choose to not pay, but I think most of the mining groups won't bother with, because it isn't worth the time to them.
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:14:45
If you sell bitcoins for cash into paypal, you're taking a large risk that the buyer will file a dispute and paypal will side with them. Paypal doesn't cover virtual goods and nothing you can give them would count as proof of "shipping" the bitcoins; you'd be out both the bitcoins and the cash.
I wouldn't even do it with someone trustworthy because paypal has a history of freezing accounts for things they don't like, and even if they eventually release your funds, it could be half a year or more. Big risks.

Depends what you mean by offline computer; if you use a livecd that is never connected to the internet and then save the raw transaction to a usb stick or somesuch to transfer to a different computer and push the transaction, that should be pretty safe indeed. If you just unplug your computer from the internet and generate the transaction then plug it back in, that's not safe, no.
brainwallet.org isn't really the best tool for offline transactions though, because it uses a lot of javascript that's not included in the page, so you can't save it for offline use. I think people [use this tool]( sometimes, but I've never used it so I can't speak to it.

I'm not sure what the math is without knowing how many passphrases you can convert to an address every second, which is basically what you would have to do to in order to check a pre-generated list of all addresses that have funds. This means you would be checking only already used addresses, unless you have lots of storage I suppose, in which case you could store all the billions of private keys you generate in advance and then listen to the blockchain in real time. Either way, brute forcing passwords is a very very slow process, it grows exponentially based on length. If you only use english words, someone could generate a list of all common english words, and then generate every possible combination of all those words up to some limit, but again this would take a very long time, as there are a lot of combinations. Adding any more entropy to your key via character substitutions means they would also need to be checking all those words with all the same substitutions. I imagine it would take a very very very long time if they don't know anything about your passphrase.
That said, I'm sure if you use a shitty passphrase, like a common quote, and don't add any kind of special characters to it, someone is probably already sitting on it, waiting.

Not likely. You could try double spending with an even higher transaction fee but that doesn't really solve the issue.
Once it gets mined you could try pleading to whichever pool mines it, sometimes you can get back most of the fee, unless it's auto-distributed to the miners.

Best of luck to you! I assume you are leaving your computer with Bitcoin-Qt up and running all day? The only thing I can think of is that if you only let it run a short while, the blockchain could be growing faster than you can download it. You should still see your coins confirmed though once you get past the point in the chain when they were sent to your address.

Electrum uses that "weird phrase" as a seed that grows your wallet addresses, so you could, if you keep track of the phrase, regenerate your lost wallet on any computer. However if someone manages to steal your phrase (wrote it down, saved it somewhere) they can also grow a copy of your wallet.
Alternatively, if your Bitcoin-Qt wallet.dat file disappears tomorrow, all the bitcoins it controls are forever stuck in whatever address they were last sent to, if you haven't backed up the wallet.dat file or the private keys it contains.

Bitcoin-QT does allow you to encrypt your wallet, but requires 7+ gigs of space for the blockchain. I think electrum has a mac version, but am not 100% certain, if so I believe it also allows you to encrypt your wallet without downloading the whole blockchain, however I haven't really used it so don't know much about it. Armory also has a mac version I think, and allows encryption, but requires Bitcoin-QT to be installed.

Not actually sure if this would work, but you could try to sweep **all** the funds (including the ones from the unconfirmed transaction) from 1yDG8dqxExtVJzQyy326qDYy4YgmsPdCL to a new address with a decent transaction fee. Assuming the miners decide to include this transaction ahead of the free one, once the move is confirmed you could resend the original transaction from the new address. The first transaction would then fail to confirm since the first address would now be empty.
I don't think you can do this from blockchain.info's UI directly, might have to use something like  but again, I'm just taking a shot in the dark.

The quantity of bitcoins over time has to do with how many blocks have been mined. If only one computer in the world had ever been mining, there would be 21 million bitcoins in 2140. If every computer in the world was mining, there would be 21 million bitcoins in 2140. The blockchain self regulates to approximately one block per 10 minutes, and the block reward decreases by half at regular intervals.
Additionally, lost coins still exist, they just can't be spent anymore. This may more may not mean there are no longer 21 million coins depending on how you define the existence of a coin. All lost wallets could, in an infinite time with infinite energy, be recovered. There are some number of bitcoins that are unable to ever be spent, as they were written to the blockchain with an impossible condition required to spend them (namely a private key that hashes to an impossible value).

If you mine in the standard client, a new address is created and the coins are put into it.
I'm not sure if that's part of the protocol or if the pools can change it to point to an address they control, but either way when you sign up with a pool you give them a payout address and usually you are given tiny shares of each found block, and then you can get a payout when all your shares add up to a certain number.
Also, in the standard client, mined coins can't be spent until something like 120 confirmations.

The problem is already solved; if you want to "hold your gold", you need space for it. Security isn't usually fast or easy. There are plenty of other wallets if you want to only be mostly secure.
I think there are some proposals for changes to Bitcoin-Qt to allow lighter blockchain downloads (they're pruned somehow), but all you're actually doing in that case is hosting your own "unsafe" wallet, since you can't go in with your own tools and verify everything from start to finish. An ever growing multigig blockchain is the security you're asking for and then calling a problem.

There is no vote, it's a matter of longest blockchain. If you control the bulk of the hashing power, you can in theory consistently produce a longer chain than the rest of the network put together. If you can build the longest chain the fastest, you can dictate which blocks are valid and ignore any transactions you want, or invalidate old transactions by overwriting them into a new longer blockchain.

Your private key in a Bitcoin-Qt wallet is useless very quickly, because it uses change addresses to seamlessly obfuscate fund transfers; any funds you send that you get to your address will actually reside in other addresses when you respend them.
If you really want to see your private key you can click Help / Debug window, then the Console tab, and type **dumpprivkey YOURADDRESSHERE**. If the wallet is locked, you'll need to type **walletpassphrase "Your Passphrase Here" 60** to unlock it for 60 seconds first.

Miners are generating blocks; blocks include network transactions. Miners process transactions. Currently they are rewarded for doing so; 25 btc per block, down from the original 50, and dropping by half at a controlled rate. At some point the reward will be less than one satoshi, and will effectively not exist. Fees are meant to be the reason to keep mining once the block reward drops, as miners also get any fees people add to their transactions.

Say you have 1 BTC, and your friend Bob has 1BTC. He sends you 0.5 BTC, so now you have 1.5 and he has 0.5. Now you want to roll on satoshidice; what you actually have are two inputs in your address, one of 1 BTC and one of 0.5 BTC. The client picks one of these (using some code that is complex) and then sends the amount you roll to satoshidice (0.01) and the rest (either 0.49 or 0.99) back to what is called a "change address", an address you control but don't actually see in the client. This is done to increase anonymity for you, rather than letting someone look up your one address and see every transaction you've ever done, but is confusing to new users.
Not all clients use change addresses, but all transactions *must* send the change somewhere, or else the miners get it as a fee.

The strange thing about a 51% attack is that you have to believe it is more profitable to destroy the network than it is to keep the coins you mine; if you control 51% of the hashrate, you produce the majority of blocks, and would thus gain all mined coins and fees during this time.
If you believe bitcoin is a threat and needs to be destroyed, then you must believe it will have a huge impact on everything, but not huge enough to maintain control of the network; instead it will only be huge enough to be worth wasting millions of dollars on with no return. I don't really see how these are compatible ideas.

It doesn't really matter to someone buying weed how much it costs to buy 1 BTC if they're looking to specifically spend $X for Y quantity. People would still use bitcoins for drugs at 1 penny per BTC if they knew they could get money in and out without too much hassle.
I'm not sure this answers your question at all, but I don't think illegal use has much impact on the price directly, although it may help keep trade volume up.

It should be fine, change addresses only matter when you spend funds, and in theory if you keep encrypted backups of both wallets on a regular basis, you should be golden.
Bitcoins are stored in the blockchain, not in the wallets; the wallets hold the keys that let you reassign (spend) funds that are currently assigned to the addresses in the wallet. If you spend coins from a wallet, they will also be gone from all backups.

A change address is in theory more anonymous, as you can't tell which address if any in the transaction the original sender controls. If the change goes back to the original address, you can be pretty sure they have maintained control of those funds, allowing you to associate *all* transactions with that address with a specific user. If the coins never stay more than one transaction in a single address, it becomes very hard to be certain any further transactions are being done by the original owner.
It's just confusing for normal users though, in my opinion.

Imported keys can't be recovered from the passphrase though, which makes them a weak point in wallet recovery. Ideally you'd send them, but if you're too cheap or have a lot of dust you want to hang on to, you can indeed import the keys, and just keep really good backups.

Change isn't returned anywhere at all "by default". Any change not specified with a destination is the mining fee, which has led to some issues of rather large mining fees when people accidentally spend only a tiny part of the whole paper wallet and don't send the change anywhere at all. Some clients return it to a change address, some return it to the sending address. In either case you probably shouldn't reuse the paper wallet any more because you've likely just typed the private key somewhere it could be compromised.
If I was using paper wallets I would manually send the "change" to a new wallet address, rather than back to the original, possibly compromised old wallet.

It's not just mailinator that's an issue; mailinator has many domains, and people can "donate" more. On top of that, gmail has the option to do myemail+someidentifier which would allow an unlimited number of gmail addresses. On top of THAT, I have my own domain names and I can generate an infinite number of email addresses under those as well. Email is not useful for identifying a unique "person" in any sense.
Be sure to throw a good captcha on there, and think about maybe doing some IP filtering or logging on top of it (although with proxies that's fairly useless as well, but at least tracking the IPs of signups would let you react to things like 1000 signups from the same IP).

Seriously, bitcoins aren't a thing. I guess you could say satoshis are a thing, if you want to thingify bitcoins, but lets pretend.
I use 1 BTC to hire a man to kill someone. That man sends .5 BTC to each of his suppliers for ammo or some shit. Each of those men send that .5 BTC to two other people, and now you have four lots of .25 BTC. Now your friend gets .25 BTC, and another .5 BTC from winning it big on satoshidice. He consolidates his wallets, because he has OCD, so now he has .75 BTC in one address. From this he sends you .1 BTC. Which transaction did those .1 come from? You could potentially trace them if he had not consolidated, but at the point where he merged them into a larger chunk, you've lost the plot. Bitcoins exist as transactions of large amounts of small numbers, joining and splitting, forever.
I suppose they could go after your friend, but I have all these dollar bills with cocaine on them, and nobody's come after me.

MtGox mixes all their funds into addresses they control; when the 1.9 BTC transaction happened, 4 inputs were used, totaling 3.0018849 BTC. 1.9 BTC was sent to the withdraw address, 0.0005 BTC went to the fee, and the leftover (1.1013849 BTC) went to the [change address]( also in MtGox's control.
This is how bitcoin transactions work. It's more complicated to look at than normal because of how MtGox sweeps all deposited funds into addresses it controls, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in it.

This is how *some bitcoin wallets* work. It's not fundamental to the protocol. You can always use something like  or an offline equivalent to make sure the funds come back to your paper wallet.
**Make certain the sender you are using generates a transaction sending the leftovers back to your wallet! If it doesn't, the leftover coins will be collected by the miners instead!**
However, if you aren't generating the transaction on a PC that will has never / will never be connected to the internet, there's every chance your private key will be compromised anyway, so it's not always advisable to reuse a paper wallet.

It's a great question, and the only answer I can think of is that the sender doesn't have internet access for some reason (doesn't trust using your machines to send coins, has no mobile phone, etc), and/or you don't want to accept 0 confirmations/wait for 1 confirmation. Alternatively, maybe you don't want the transaction to show on the blockchain for some reason?

Bitcoin has fewer advantages to those if you are using it as a vehicle to send, for example, USD to bitcoins to USD at your local coffee shop, just to claim you/they use bitcoins. I don't know what the fees would be, but I assume to cover fraud they would need to be reasonably on par with any other form of exchange, and you would lose the customer protection that you get with paypal/credit cards/etc, as once the bitcoins leave your account to go to the merchant's bitpay account, the transaction is non-reversable. The only way to really provide those benefits is for both the consumer and the merchant to use bitpay, and then there is no reason to convert to bitcoins; it's just bitpaypal.

Keep in mind that everything in the post above will add to the cost of the transaction.

It ended up back in a MtGox wallet most likely. I don't know about the fees but it doesn't really matter, any fees MtGox charged wouldn't show up on the blockchain.
When you deposit bitcoins into MtGox, they're immediately swept from the address you send them to into wallets MtGox maintains control over. Then when you withdraw, you get some coins from some random wallet that MtGox controls. If they were charging a fee, they would just send some percentage less bitcoins to the address you wanted, but in either case the change goes back to MtGox.

Your response depends on a different interpretation of the phrase "paper wallet". Some people use it to mean "brain wallet", one address/private key on one piece of paper. In this case the change would certainly go any number of places depending on where you place the private key to spend from it.
In your case, the "paper wallet" is just a backup of the seed used to generate the wallet, and contains no private key info directly. You would need to re-import the seed to regenerate the wallet to spend from it. In this case yes, the change would go back to a key within the regenerated wallet. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:03:12
I don't think there's really any secure way to display a private key, because if you can turn the private key into the address (to verify it) you can also sign a transaction with it (to spend it).
I can't think of any way to validate it without being connected to the internet, but I guess if you had an internet connection the bill could work like a security key, with a button you press that gives you a number that you can enter on a website somewhere (like Google Authenticator) along with the bill's serial number and it would validate it for you, but again, that seems like a lot of effort and requires internet access.
I think the biggest issue is that Bitcoin wasn't really designed with this use case in mind. I think it's a solvable problem, but would likely require changes to Bitcoin itself, or a new altcoin designed with this use in mind. If I was going to make physical bitcoins, I'd probably design them with a focus on being counterfeit resistant, and also come up with a way to make redeeming the actual bitcoins destroy the coin/bill. Then people just have to trust the bill is genuine, and trust the issuer (me in this case), which is a totally separate issue.

A wallet is a collection of private keys (decently long strings) that correspond to bitcoin addresses (1:1) which can be allocated sums of BTC. If you have the private key to an address, you can reallocate the funds allocated to that address to any other address. Wallet software is all different, and allows all manner of security, usually one or more forms of encryption. Keeping it safe means encryption + offsite backup, usually redundant offsite backup.
In the future bitcoin prices will go up, unless they go down. I know this to be true because those are the options. Also, they could stay the same.
Edit: I noticed this is an ELI5 request. Whoops.
Wallets are actually keychains, and bitcoin addresses are like postboxes. Anyone can put envelopes containing bitcoins into the postboxes, but only people with keys can open the postbox up and move the envelopes inside to another postbox.
If your house burns down and you don't keep your keys safe, they melt and you'll be sad. And broke.

The generation rate is fixed, there is no "too hard to mine". If people are so inept that they lose their coins at the drop of a hat, then yes, bitcoin will probably be unworkable. I imagine that in order for people that inept to use bitcoins on that scale, better software would need to exist, which should, in theory, protect people from themselves somewhat. In any case, it doesn't matter if all but one satoshi is lost, as it could, in theory, be divided infinitely. However if loss was that great, it's unlikely anyone but technically minded people would use bitcoin, and without mass adoption value will be limited.
None of this matters though, as bitcoin is unlikely to ever change how it handles "lost coins". I'm not up to speed on the alt chains, but if demand was great enough, I would assume a new coin that allows either recovery of lost coins or infinite mining would eventually surpass bitcoin in popularity.

It would also "contain" the value of the fees for that block, and I'm not sure how you could verify that without checking the actual block itself.
According to footnote 7 [on this page]( *Note that when the transaction is accepted into the memory pool, an additional check is made to ensure that the coinbase value does not exceed the transaction fees plus the expected BTC value (25BTC as of this writing).* I'm not sure why you would bother having the spec include any kind of transaction value when you have to manually verify it anyway against the block it's coming from.

I'm not sure there's been any recent talk, I think BFL started talking about their units in June of last year, which is when most of the speculation was; any of that info would probably be outdated by now.

It's a fee you pay the miners for processing your transaction. It's there to pay the miners for processing your transaction. It pays the miners for processing your transaction.
Once the block reward goes away (actually likely well before they go away) the fees per block will need to cover the cost the miner's incur.

Your coins can't really be "stolen from the network" unless someone gains access to your private key. The easiest way to do this is to steal your wallet. Alternatively they could obtain your passphrase if it's a brainwallet or deterministic wallet.
Truecrypt is only useful against having your wallet stolen while you aren't using it. If you have the truecrypt volume mounted, any trojan on your computer would have access to the wallet during this time. If you need to access the wallet, you need to have the volume mounted; it's an extra step that provides very little security except in the case of your machine being physically stolen from you.

Transactions in [orphaned blocks]( are reprocessed by the miners and either reincluded in new blocks or discarded if they are now invalid.

The point in verifying them again is that if you don't a malicious peer could feed you a bullshit blockchain.
If you don't want the security of the blockchain, you can use a thin wallet like electrum or multibit.

If you transferred them to MtGox, they've likely just swept them into the exchange's wallet and will be credited to your account after some confirmations or somesuch. Dunno if other accounts work the same.

Because if you get a refund and then BFL starts shipping 300 units a day for some reason, and everyone who didn't get a refund makes a billion dollars, boy won't you feel stupid?
If you've already lost the money you could have made spending your BFL purchase dollars on bitcoins, you certainly don't want to lose even more money by requesting a refund.
It's not good logic, by any means, but humans are strange creatures.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:07:56
You would need to because that's how the protocol works; longest chain wins. How do you know which is the most valid chain if you don't have a benchmark? If someone is attacking the blockchain, at some point both chains are equal length, and there's no method to say that one chain is more valid than the other; in fact someone could be side mining right now and unleash a chain that is 100 blocks ahead of the current chain, it's very unlikely, but it would invalidate the current chain once it came online. The only way to combat that would be to hardcode one chain as legit within the client at the point they diverge, which requires a central authority to do.

Actually that would be way more than half at that point in time; the last bitcoins won't be mined for 100 years or so. Regardless, that is not deemed a flaw in bitcoin, as the link I gave you explains.

For 2, forcing encryption on an average user with no way to recover is literally the worst possible idea. You could maybe mitigate it by forcing them to enter the passphrase whenever they start the program, but allowing them to see an address and send coins to it and then completely forget the passphrase, or lose the paper they wrote it down on, with no recovery, will be a huge huge huge thing. I've done tech support, believe me, people forget passwords they've used every day for a year, and the password was their kids name or something. Regular people can't handle encryption they're solely responsible for, you'd have to somehow ease them into it.
For 3, MtGox uses an individual address for every person, that changes for every transaction. There's no way to verify it. Pretty much all shopping carts work the same. There's no cost to generating an address, and it's the easiest way to separate deposits and purchases. You'll only scare them if it's automatic, I promise. Bitcoin addresses include checksums, so it's actually hard to send to a typo. Multibit has builtin exchange prices I think, so you can see the value of a transaction, but no warnings. It's not a terrible idea but if the exchange is down, what should it do?
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:00:08
The path forward is to raise the limit, which will cause a hard fork; anyone who doesn't upgrade will be left behind on the old fork. There's a lot of strife because apparently changing the protocol is a violation of some kind of liberty or sovereign currency or something. I don't know if there is any kind of timeline planned at current.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:18:15
Yes, as long as you don't import addresses from other sources, you can regenerate your whole wallet from just that key. When you do a recovery (say if you lost your wallet) it would ask you how many addresses you want to recover, so if you had generated like 20 new addresses over time, it would create a new wallet with 25 addresses instead of 5, and they would be all the addresses you had used.

Assuming your transactions aren't blacklisted by the miners for some reason (there's still talk of blacklisting satoshidice transactions!) and you have internet access, and you pay the correct amount of fees, sure, you have 100% control.

RAM is not a processor, it can't do calculations. Super simplified, GPUs are good for doing lots of parallel calculations not quite so fast, whereas CPUs are good at doing one calculation at a time faster. Calculating a hash is pretty easy, so being able to do many of them at once is much better than one at a time even on the fastest CPUs.
You probably won't earn crap on your old laptop, and you'll likely pay more in energy costs than you'd ever make leaving it running all the time.

Sure, I suppose, but seeing it as part of the login form would have lead me to believe that it was enabled at login; if you can compromise the login separately, it isn't really protected in my mind.
I've certainly seen it applied to tasks individually *after* logging in, which I would expect, but having an optional field on login seems like a hell of a strange way to do things. At the very least it needs more clarification for users, it seems.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:38:46
Yeah, it's called risk, and you take it on and measure it against the payoff. If it's not worth the risk for the reward, you decide not to do it. If there was no risk, everyone would do it, and the opportunity to do it wouldn't be there to begin with.

A protocol change to increase the total number of bitcoins would require a hard fork, and at least 51% of the miners to upgrade, and possibly all Bitcoin-Qt clients (I'm not sure if the rewards limit is checked before accepting blocks marked valid in the clients). Any changes at all, even bugfixes, are usually met with resistance by the community, so pushing a major change through would be tough. Even if the miners move over, people could decide that the miners were wrong and use clients that don't support the new chain. Transactions would be slow for a while, but if the miners can't sell their new chain coins, they would be forced to switch back to the old chain.

When I make vanity addresses, I use **importprivkey 5WhateverThePrivateKeyIs "Vanity Address" false** to import them, as the false at the end skips the blockchain rescan that hangs up Bitcoin-Qt for a billion years.
I also verify that nobody else has used it at blockchain.info first, but really there's unlikely to be any funds in a newly generated vanity address so rescanning the blockchain is a waste of time.

Probably because there *is* nothing to buy. You could ask someone to build you a 3 grand GPU mining rig; at least that way the GPUs could have some resale value if you don't make anything on the venture.

When you send bitcoins, you send the transactions your address has received. If you have 10 bitcoins, and you received them as two 5 btc transactions, and you want to send 8 btc to a friend, you send a transaction that says "Send 8 btc from input1 + input2 to 1MyFriendsAddress, and then send the 2 btc leftover to 1MyChangeAddress". I'm not certain where the transaction info is generated that you need to reference to spend the 2 btc again.

If you wanted to try to warn the person you could always send a satoshi to the public address from blockchain.info with a public note that his brainwallet isn't secure. Not guaranteed to help but the only real way to attempt to get a message to someone anonymously.
Edit: It does occur to me that you don't actually need to click the transaction tab to get the address, it's on the same page as passphrase entry, and when you click the transaction tab it doesn't automatically copy the private key for you... So is it possible you thought you found the private key for the example address, [12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX](

Ah, I suppose you have a point, I don't know what the official word is, but you get a lot of supporters who seem to claim ripple/XRPs are an open source decentralized exchange/cryptocurrency, and a lot of talking was done about how useful it was and how it was an alternative to bitcoin before anything even really existed. The waters are muddy and I've never really seen anything useful from official sources that clear anything up.
That said, it was wrong of me to attribute anything to maliciousness without some sort of evidence.

Sorry, can't hop on tor right now, so going by memory, but I think there were little question marks near a lot of places that used popup windows to explain to you what they meant, but the popup wasn't really part of the page, so it felt flow breaking. Like I would have thought a little div somewhere that's part of the page that hides/unhides so that you can reference it within the page might have been more useful.

A wallet is a collection of keys, that's the problem. It's one key per address, and a wallet can have hundreds of addresses; in the case of Bitcoin-Qt, hundreds of invisible addresses. You need to private keys for all your addresses in order to be certain you have access to all your funds. Electrum is deterministic, which means you only need to backup a single seed and you can use that to regrow your wallet in full (assuming you don't import any private keys from elsewhere) but the importance of knowing your private key is overrated in most cases, unless it is a single offline address used for cold storage. Just back up your encrypted wallet file, and your seed in the case of deterministic wallets, and you're good. (Actually in Bitcoin-Qt you need to back up your wallet file every 50-100 transactions but it's good practice to back up your files on a timely basis anyway.)

Again, there was talk of what it would take to create a blacklist to prevent people spending coins that were "bad"; coins used by pedophiles or as ransom, etc. The fact that this could happen is a pretty big deal in my mind; at no point do you have to worry that your gold will suddenly become blacklisted because some person or people decide your gold is "bad". Who could be trusted to control such a list? It doesn't even have to be every single miner, just the pools; I suppose you *could* eventually mine your own tranasction, or hope some lone miner does, but again, that's not exactly the same as holding gold.
A remote chance is still a chance, and you can't compare 1:1 bitcoin ownership to holding physical gold.
