Yes, but they are responsible for paying that money back to the central bank they loaned it from. If they don't, then they may become insolvent. Holding enough deposits to cover losses in loans is still an important aspect of banking.

Many large banks meet the standards needed to pass "stress tests" regarding capital to cover losses in lending OR speculation. 
If you look at Wells Fargo's annual report from 2012 for example ( you'll find that average deposits were near $900 billion. The average loans for this same year were only $750 Billion. Then if you add in speculation (Securities available for sale) at a value of $235 Billion, you'll see that this ratio is much farther from 0% for this specific bank. Wells Fargo has a fairly healthy balance sheet in for the 2012 business year.
So, it does depend on the bank you choose, but if a bank doesn't take deposits, it is harder to make loans even with fractional reserve lending. Because it becomes a ponzi scheme at that point. The interest from all of your loans are expected to cover the losses from specific defaults? That is crazy.

I think his only hope would have been to get the judge to deem the evidence presented by the prosecution thrown out due to Fourth Amendment violation using the NSA dragnet. 
How do you prove this was done? That's the problem. 
He's going to get the book thrown at him, even if he is "innocent". I'm not exactly sure what that word means anymore.

True, but his point is that witnesses are often wrong, and even convinced of their wrongness being true. A cross examine in these cases would only confirm that the turd is indeed a turd, and still believes it is a turd. That makes the interview just as worthless, because its whatever the person holding the account wanted people to think. 
I'd put them on the same level of evidence quality if I had my own court system.

Holding any amount bitcoin is not an investment vehicle. It has no way of generating income for its holders. In contrast, ownership in a company does this through dividends, share buyback, etc. 
Bitcoin is a commodity/currency, with a valuation relative to other currencies and investments. For instance, if you bought an ounce of gold now, the only way to get income out of it would be to sell it later at a higher price. But then you don't have the commodity anymore, so your potential of income is now gone. 
You could argue that using arbitrage is a way to earn income over time with bitcoin, but it would require serious knowledge of all markets where it is bought and sold, and high frequency trading experience to pull it off.

I think one thing I noticed from the video is that if wages do not continue to go up to match inflation, then workers get stiffed. It wasn't explicitly stated, but that was the problem we were dealing with for the last 7 years in the US.

Deflation is no picnic either. It can cause economic depressions pretty quickly. That is not to say that inflation is without its own drawbacks.

Giving him the benefit of the doubt: I think that federal withholding can change this calculation, but only per paycheck. At the end of the year its settled either way.

Right I agree that they are not fully instant to the buyer. However, the vendor can verify the funds exist and place a hold instantly. I agree that CC's are not fully "instant", but the vendor is guaranteed that the CC company will reimburse them for the amount requested pretty much immediately. (It is not truly guaranteed because a chargeback could be issued for some reason)
Chargebacks are a really weird area of Credit Cards, but they ultimately are a boon to consumers.
Either way, reducing the transaction confirmation time would be a huge benefit to Bitcoin.

I don't need to ask questions, I gave the answers as I see them. You added (C). 
C.) It takes time to adopt things that have higher utility than other things. Adoption generally follows an exponential growth curve to saturation.
The question is, with A and B not resolved, does it really have higher utility than dollars or euros?

Well said. This article is a silly neo-libertarian wedge that doesn't really need to exist. Bitcoin is an excellent technology, but if it were to replace everything, it would need to compete on its merits. This is just like any other technology. So why hasn't it seen mass adoption?
A.) It is not stable in terms of price. This isn't a bad thing if you immediately convert to a fiat currency after doing a bitcoin trade, but that makes the definition of it as a "currency" kind of questionable.
B.) The transaction can take time to confirm, and it takes significantly more time than a credit card or cash transaction on craigslist. This is not always a negative. It is WAY better than: checks, money orders, foreign currency exchange systems, etc.
Just keep using Bitcoin if you believe in it, and *stop* creating wedges. We have enough division in the world.

I think we are in agreement then. No one can predict the future, but I suspect that something will evolve from Bitcoin that will be very competitive with fiat.
