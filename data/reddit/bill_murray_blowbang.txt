Company pays for the fuel
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:44:41
I wonder if there is a way to calculate it. When my gross vehicle weight is 80,000 lbs, what a little bit of strain on the alternator? Just kicking around the idea.

I can always run the A/C on full blast and close the curtain that separates the sleeper from the cab. Probably would shut it down when it’s time to sleep. I don’t really know much about the mining subject. The only reason I thought of the idea was because I saw a video from a guy shutting down and getting rid of his rigs citing the cost of electricity making it no longer profitable.

When you’re right, you’re right. You sir are right. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:48:34
Good point. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:03:21
Do you pay for the fuel? If not, does your company notice irregularities in mpg?
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:09:25
You got me again, bud. I don’t want any trouble between myself and your obviously superior intellect. I can tell how smart you are. After all, you have the word “crypto” in your username. I’ll bet that on other social media platforms that you go by such powerful usernames such as mmagenius or veganprincess. Don’t want any problems with a king of crypto such as yourself.

Power inverter connected to the battery. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:01:06
Essentially yes. You make it sound so devious. Am I stealing it when I run my refrigerator and microwave off the same inverter?

I would only use the data connection on the iPhone 
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:59:34
Finally someone brought the math. Thanks man. Yeah, it’s not gonna happen. I got as far as finding that a gallon of diesel has 12.5 kWh. I suck at math.

You really are an uppity cunt. Elitist much? I hope you choke to death on the rosey stench of your own shit, prick !!
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:28:49
Yes. u/sha256checksum actually replied to me that he is running a gpu rig in his truck and has been for some time. He has an at&amp;t data connection. I have 50 gigs of tethering data that is included in my Sprint unlimited plan. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:53:21
Ok dude. You win. I’m a cunt. Now kick rocks
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:46:55
Again, I am only using the DATA CONNECTION of the IPhone. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:15:50
Bing? You still here? I thought I told you to go fuck your mother 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:31:45
Not trolling but am definitely ignorant on the subject hence asking about feasibility.
