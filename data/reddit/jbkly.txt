It's just the title of the article. I had heard that argument (that Bitcoin can't work as a currency with the new IRS rules because it would make it no longer fungible), and I thought this was a helpful counter-argument.

The same way Google isn't held responsible if someone uses Gmail to send threats, and Craigslist isn't held responsible for enabling prostitution when people use it to post ads for erotic services.

He said he would not buy either Apple or Google stock, though they might or might not rise in value. He said he doesn't know how to value them. Whether or not that's the same as saying they're not good investments, I don't know.

He also apparently doesn't think companies like Apple and Google are good investments either:

So we are supposed to keep records of every little purchase we make with bitcoin?

You're right. Just the price record of USD value at the time of each transaction. It's still a huge pain and seems like it'll hamper usage of a crypto as a daily currency. 
Edit: Ok, sounds like this won't be such a problem as long as we use the right spending tools that track everything correctly. Cool!

The author says he personally thinks it won't become a successful currency, but not because of the IRS taxation decision. He's saying the argument by some that the taxation rule will kill Bitcoin as currency won't stop Bitcoin from working as a currency because it applies equally to fiat.
