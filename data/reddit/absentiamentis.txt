That is a nice service although you just also explained why it's completely useless in regards to Bitcoin/Crypto news.

It's just that you can't eat digital currency like you can tulips.

I fully agree but as soon as I dive into it a bit more I get lost. I am one of ~~the few~~ those who opened up an account with a trader and am happily enjoying my returns whilst being mostly clueless.

This chart I like. What would it say with 5 years of relevant data?

And he's misspelling 4 words. That was the joke.

With a 0.18%-0.10% fee like Kraken does. If I buy/sell €1000,-, Kraken takes €1,8-.€1,-

I fully understand that. I was just asking if there was an app or something where you can login with your wallet info and it can process things like QR codes or ideal/paypal payment links. 
Asking for convenience. If I need to log into my wallet and manually enter the store's address the 'entry' to paying with cryptos is higher than when I can just have an app where my info is pre-loaded and I can just scan an image or click a link.

Is there an app where people can send the BTC to your address, like Ideal or Paypal? Or do customers need to visit their wallet/exchange and input your address manually?

Kraken.com (Dutch guy). They charge very little in fees, 0.18% when you're starting I believe (So 1,8€ per 1000€ transaction)

Nice, ty!

So, I'm kinda new to hardware wallets. Is a 24 word seed backup like a password containing 24 different words? Like a sentence you made up?

Nice idea but it looks like the arrows have no function other than underlining some terms.

Are the problems all from users with USD accounts? I'm EUR and so far I haven't had any problems.
