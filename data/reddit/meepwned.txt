Jared Polis is a good guy.  He caught my attention way back when SOPA was making the rounds.  He definitely knows what he is in D.C. for.

Amazing - you have Liga Privada No. 9's, and I can pay in Bitcoin?!  
You have a new customer :)

Legal professional here - I want to chime in on one thing.  The thread of discussion in this matter about the judge "allowing them to sue" raises my eyebrows a little bit.  In the United States, this is not how any matter I have ever been involved with works.
First, you don't have to ask a judge permission to file suit.  I can sue somebody because I don't like the color shirt they are wearing, and I don't have to OK it with a judge beforehand.  The usual process is to send a demand letter, wait until they respond (or not), and then file a petition with the court.
Second, if they did walk into a court and ask permission to sue, the judge's statement about their next steps, as referenced in the article, was just him pushing them out of court so he could take care of real cases.  If that course of events did happen, which I doubt it did, 1) it has no bearing on whether or not the case will actually be brought to trial or not dismissed, and 2) means that they probably have a grossly incompetent attorney that will get this case dropped in record time.
I bring this up because this whole thing looks odd to me, and I think we should refrain from getting excited about anything until we see certified copies of a filed petition from a court.

I suppose this could be the case.  I will reserve judgment until something develops further.

I actually made my first real bitcoin purchase yesterday as well.  Bought some Sobranie cigarettes from Russia.  Much easier than dealing with international credit card restrictions on tobacco.

Exactly.  Once a suit is filed, the other side (PayPal) can move to take it to arbitration, have it dismissed, etc.  The judge will make a decision on how to move forward at that point, not before anything is filed.

My first thought for motive is that TerraHasher, if that is a real ebayer (I haven't bothered to check), is trying to drum up sympathy business for his eBay shop.

I am in the process of building a firearms service, and we have specifically chosen not to launch with a Bitcoin payment option for this reason.
Specifically, I think at this point our business model would be used as bad press for the Bitcoin community, not for our business.  People like Chuck Schumer would love a chance to tear apart Bitcoin because "anybody can use them to buy a gun online anonymously."
Once awareness spreads of Bitcoin a bit more and the whole anonymous drugs on the internet line dies down, we will incorporate Bitcoins into our service.

They have been working quite nicely for me since they whitelisted my account.  I have had no problem buying and selling multiple times.
What kind of trouble are you having with them?
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:59:45
An update: I was able to purchase bitcoins and got them no problem.  All is well!

Very good point.  I am not very familiar with foreign jurisdictions at all, so I guess that is possible.  I wish we had his eBay screen name to investigate (I haven't had any luck searching for ebayer 'TerraHasher')

The one issue that is a real, just legal complaint (assuming this whole story is true) is that his accounts were presumably frozen, while still holding some of his funds.  Unless it is made clear prior to engaging in business with an individual what the rules are, attempting to withhold the seller's money is not a just or legal thing to do.  The proper course of action for PayPal/eBay would be to issue a statement or update their TOS saying that all future Bitcoin related transactions are not allowed.

Just saying Hi!
