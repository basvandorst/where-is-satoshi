For anyone who got tricked into buying at $19k and just watched half that value evaporate, it's a bit of a big deal.

Massive instability and volatility like the last two hours.
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:09:44
Yeah, 2018 being a total flatline definitely means $50k in two years, for sure.

This comment section is a pretty clear example of why no one takes this sub’s active user base seriously.
“It’ll be worth $1 million in three years”: ALL HAIL THE LAMBO GOD
“It’s a bubble”: WHO CARES WHAT HE THINKS?
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:42:11
That’s about as dribbling on the carpet of a response as I expected. Can’t wait for tomorrow’s next “here’s why it will recover this week for certain!” post out of you.  I’m sure this time you’ll be right.
@_date: 2018-08-27 17:58:23
I’d even up the ante and say it will be less than $8500.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:00:56
Yeah, sputtering to life for whole days at a time until dropping back to last October’s prices totally looks like the opposite of dead to me.
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:01:23
Every day, someone tells me "it's gonna recover any day now", and yet here we are five months later, still unable to scrape up to 50&amp; of where it was at in December.  I bought in at $10k because I thought "surely, there's no way this thing is going to crash *that* hard" and yet, it did.  And after five months it still hasn't recovered, despite everyone in this sub insisting it's "back on track".
Nothing about a 75&amp; crash overnight makes Bitcoin look strong or stable, nor does its utter inability to recover do it any favors.  Any media story about it is guaranteed to include its total collapse over the winter, and that's a bad look when you desperately need good publicity.
Yes, I think it's overvalued right now.  And yes, I think this sub is a massive circlejerk that is constantly 100&amp; certain that fortune is on the horizon, even while it loses value in front of their eyes.  This whole thing is built on hype.  And when it's no longer reliably rising, the hype vanishes to reveal what it's actually worth.
At this point, I'm just looking to break even and bail.  This is unsustainable.
EDIT: Bring on the downvotes, delusional folks.  Cry me a river.  BTC is still sunk from a crash half a year ago, that’s a fact you can’t downvote away.
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:31:59
You're right, the US dollar is totally as unstable as Zimbabwe.  Totally.
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:48:55

@_date: 2018-05-11 08:39:16
Not an answer, kid.  I asked **how much** you lost in December.  That means a number, not an excuse.
You can dance around it all you like, and be a snotty little ass, [wasting your months mocking no one]( for gains you’re not making, but at the end of the day you lost just like every other idiot who thinks the party will never stop.
So unless you’re gonna grow a pair and give me an actual number with a currency unit in front of it, I have no interest in arguing with a pussy hiding behind his pathetic recycled insults.
If you “never lost because you’ve never sold”, you’re an even bigger dumbass than most of the Kool-Aid drinkers in this sub.  Then again, your embarrassing, obsessive post history makes that pretty clear all on its own.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:01:06
I fail to see how that invalidates my point in any way.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:27:37

How much did you lose in December?
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:18:52
I predict Bitcoin will hit $30,000 in 2019 FIGHT ME.
For real though, at this point I’ll be impressed if it can even hold $12k for a full week before 2018 is over.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:11:39
It’s not and it won’t be.  Zimbabwe’s economy collapsed because of the Mugabe regime literally just printing money for itself until the currency was worthless.
There is a 0% chance of the United States doing that, and since 2011 inflation hasn’t crossed 4%.  Hell, in 2009 and 2016, the USD was actually *deflating*.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:37:19
I spent $100 when it was at $10k, and $50 on Ethereum when it was at $1k.  What difference does it make?

You’re right, I should totally have sunk my life savings into a cryptocurrency that lost 75% of its value in a week.  That would be a much smarter move, right?  Keep HODLing, it totally never fails.
How much did you lose in December?

How?  My wallet didn’t suddenly get 75% lighter last Christmas.
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:15:52
Is there a reason you don’t show the full 75% drop since December, or the inability of BTC to stabilize above 7K?
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:56:36
Not with BTC unable to keep itself above 7K for the last six months, it isn’t.
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:59:02
The funny thing about “self-evident” things is that they are very easy to prove.
But as you’ve now taken *days* to continue to avoid what should be a very trivial exercise for your vast superiority complex to handle, it’s pretty clear you can’t prove any of it, and this is your rather pitiful attempt to deflect from that fact.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:03:56

@_date: 2018-11-27 16:01:59


 *It’s down 81% from last year.*


Literally the exact same thing you lot said back in February.  (BTC is doing worse now, in case you were wondering.)
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:01:56


Bro, you’re about a year late.

You know, you and I have been debating this for a full year now.

@_date: 2018-11-27 15:43:58

[“Your insults reveal to me that I have won the debate.”](
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:05:12
BTC is imploding hard, this was really not a great time to buy.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:24:08
Definitely not first.  Far from last.  None of them correct.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:54:05
And surely, because everything that happened before must happen again, you will have this same argument whenever this "temporary setback" is over with.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:35:42

@_date: 2018-11-26 07:03:39
I don’t, actually.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:55:56
Of course it doesn’t “need” fixing.  You can’t fix a terminal illness.
The last crash never sent it below pre-spike prices.  This one has.  We’re *still* not back to pre-spike prices after a full year.  This is a more severe crash than Bitcoin has ever seen before, and it was a very very public crash while people were using it the most.
No one wants to play Monopoly with this volatile funny money anymore, and without public support, no matter how much the tech advances or how many banks and countries decide to buy up what’s left, the game is over.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:20:29
That’s true, I’m only out $70 this year ($106-&gt;$36).  How much did you lose, with all your empty promises?
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:23:45
This is the time of year BTC is normally *spiking*, and it’s utterly tanking.
Bad call.  Based on the cries of congratulations on this awful move, no one in here is any good at the stock market, either.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:13:52
No despair from me.  I dropped $150 in at $10k out of curiosity and never went back, despite people constantly telling me “no, but NOW it’s safe to buy!”  I feel real bad for any rubes dumb enough to dump thousands or more into a dying fad currency.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:42:30
As I’m sure you’ve been saying for the past six months.  And the six months before that.  And the six months before that.
If you think banks aren’t getting in on Bitcoin (when it’s worth getting in on), you’re an even bigger fool than I thought.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:32:21

@_date: 2018-11-25 16:42:45

Is “never” sooner than “never”?
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:00:57
You haven’t made a single correct prediction so far, so I highly doubt that.
The only Monopoly money right now is the one based on nothing but speculation: Bitcoin.

How’s that working out for ya right now?
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:13:01
And as we all know, past behavior predicts future behavior, always.
What trajectory does it have, exactly?  Tell me what that trajectory is, I want you to put a number on it.
It’s pretty telling that you feel the need to embed metaphor into all of your fully-empty statements rather than actually have anything of substance to say.
The roller coaster is over.  2018 has been a long, slow decline.  The last crash was wildly embarrassing by virtue of being in the limelight when it happened.  The public is done, the banks are closing in, and you can be damn sure they’re going to trickle it all into their pockets nice and slow to minimize cost.  Like they’re already doing.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:40:55
Psst.  The targets keep getting lowered because *the value keeps imploding*.  They’re not trolls, because they’re not wrong.

Somehow I suspect if I had the opposite opinion you wouldn’t feel compelled to express your own.
I’ve been arguing with our friend here for the past year, during which he has consistently insisted that recovery is imminent.  This ain’t it, chief.
And if your “smoking gun” is that my attitude about deluded BTC fanatics right now is consistent, then I don’t know what to tell you about your alleged deductive skills, either.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:59:52
Thank you for admitting Bitcoin’s alleged future success is unprovable.  You are the first person to breathe and say that, even if you don’t actually believe it.
It’s gone from $0 to not-$20, back down to $3.5k.  Not a good look.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  It’s a Beanie Baby with a math formula stapled to its head.  It only has value for as long as people care to give it value.

Wrong. In 2017, there is a 563.02% "point" to have stepped in last year and gotten lucky.
Can you point me in the direction of any sort of analysis that would indicate gains in the 5.6x range from 2016?  How do you calculate the risk involved in buying in in 2017?  If you can't give me any sort of mathematical analysis as to how doing it now is any better than doing it last year or not doing it at all, then it is a simple *gamble*, nothing more, and one that preys on those who enter into the game later on.

I'm not talking about ROI.  I'm talking about the insistence that &amp;quot;**someday** it will be worth lots!&amp;quot;  It already was, and arguably still is.  Welcome to currency trading.  Not to mention, giving someone 0.005 BTC means a lot less if you tell them "This was worth $100 in December!"


Far from ignoring it.  That just speaks even more to how wildly volatile the currency is, and it isn't ready for primetime yet.  No company can afford to do business in a currency that can't hold its value stable, especially right around the holiday season.

You’ve been acting like a petulant child (and for some embarrassing reason you call people “dinosaur” like that’s meant to be some extreme, edgy comeback), so I just assumed you were some teenager desperately trying to look cool in front of all these people you want to impress so badly.

Looking more likely by the day.  If it doesn’t pick up by September, we might end up below $4k when the annual crash (hooray predictable failure point) comes down at the start of 2019.

Truth is not something that can be chosen.  Something is true, or it isn’t, and science is the process of determining which.

This is hilarious satire and all, but science is provable.  It’s the backbone of... I mean, fucking *science*.
Acceleration caused by gravity at sea level under one atmospheric pressure being 9.8 meters per second squared is a quantifiable, provable value.  It’s not a belief, it is a fact.  And it’s provable.  Trivially.
Science is all about testing a hypothesis, proving or disproving it, and corroborating with further tests until a final declaration can be made.
You wouldn’t have penicillin without science.  You wouldn’t have cameras without science.  You wouldn’t have Bitcoin without science.
But then you seem to be one of those ignorant folks who thinks that scientists are some shadowy group of outsiders machinating to bend the world to its whim (which is what, exactly?), so maybe you’re just kind of a fucking idiot.

He said “trusted”, not “trustworthy”.
“Trusted” meaning it’s legal tender everywhere in the country, and has a stable value that doesn’t need to be calculated on the fly and converted to something else to be used effectively.

“It was worth nothing once, so it grew by infinity percent!”
Bitcoin also lost 75% of its value in two weeks, and hasn’t recovered half a year later.  USD doesn’t do that, so I think I’m gonna stick with fiat.
I can trust that USD isn’t going to just up and implode tomorrow.  I can’t be as sure with BTC.

Yes.  It’s essentially a retirement fund that you put a portion of your salary into (which many employers will match up to a certain point — my last job matched up to 6%).  You can withdraw it anytime after you reach 59.5 (and are taxed on it as income when you do), and if you’re smart and start one early it can support you for the rest of your life.

@_date: 2018-07-15 16:39:41
Specific words mean specific things.  “Trusted” and “trustworthy” mean specific, distinct things.
You don’t get to change the definition of words because you can’t read.
Bonus: I never said he didn’t say “trust”.  You insisted that he didn’t say “trusted”.  You were wrong.
Double bonus: I can trust that my USD won’t be worth 10% less tomorrow.  I can’t say the same for my BTC.

Because that $40\-worth of BTC was worth $100 two months ago.
