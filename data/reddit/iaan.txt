Can you tell why banks would want to keep bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:20:32
And how can Bitcoin solve their problem?

You should eat something more heathy. Drop cola and fried stuff and cook for yourself ;-)

Thats a lot of assumption.

Yes, I was using blockchain.info -  
I'm looking now for better wallet solution
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:35:54
Yup, :-( I used a dice way to much. Fortunately didn't lost much, but well... Time to give up that stupid hobby.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:46:24
Yes, satoshi dice

Not thinking on this an investment. I already put savings somewhere. I just want to get bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:11:30
Cex / Ghash statement about it - they say they are taking steps to prevent passing 51%
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:30:40
Its not worth it. Mining is not profitable and even more difficulty is increasing quickly these days
@_date: 2014-05-24 12:00:47
Perhaps "invest" was bad choice of word. I just mean buy / convert.
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:14:33
I leave you this:

Great video &amp; smart guy!

If you look it through "half full / half empty glass" metaphor, then you can see it also as 180k buyout, right? To sell, you need to find a buyer. Don't forget that ;-)

This is the gif that illustrates it better:

That's why it'll never be adopted by the rich ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:59:24
Billions? Are you talking about like 20% of world population?

Potato quality article.
If they are mining Monero via Coinhive script - they are not mining Bitcoin.

Lol, I go and use Apple pay everyday. Pay for groceries, transportation and in-app purchases.When can bitcoin do this?
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:58:52
Bad day in crypto means you already sold out, right? 
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:37:30
Do you know the concept of punctuation?
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:22:55
You live in States right? It’s different here in Europe :-)

If you want to go stealth use paper / memory wallet or Trezor.

I wonder how much this guy is hodling

There are also elites in who holds vast amounts of bitcoins (compared to average Joe) and transactions also needs middleman (miners) fees
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:38:47
2017 bitcoin actually scored big. Plenty of people sold. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:25:13
There are rumors that this 1,5k of bitcoins were moved from cold storage address.

@_date: 2016-05-21 16:39:00
Is there an estimate how much miners are currently making from fees? For example, in comparison to block reward?
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:05:26
Does it mean now that most of drug-dealers from Silkroad are rich now?
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:00:00
Heh, this is what others are explicitly mentioning in the comments here ;-) You should be aware that circle &amp; coinbase are solutions where you don't have 100% control &amp; transparency over your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:16:37
I lost about ~0.5 btc this way few years ago with similar setup at cex.io :-(
