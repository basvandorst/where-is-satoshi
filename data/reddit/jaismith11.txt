Aww I’m sorry. Don’t let those fuckers ruin your experience. I would suggest creating a coinbase account to purchase your amount. Then create a paper wallet and transfer the coins there. It can be for your son but you may want to keep a hold of it because if you lose it, your $ is gone forever!!
Good luck, happy holidays!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:35:51
What were you using, Shopify? I was just doing research on the Coinbase integration but can barely find any info...

Lmao! Good move. Let’s hope she can be around to see what her couple bucks grew into ����
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:57:08
Could hold some truth. Koreans could be buying in fear of Nuclear war with the north. BTC is an easy way to take your wealth with you anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:45
Sounds kind of fishy. I think you may have been scammed. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:55:41
Get this scam shit the fuck out of here
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:01:08
Duuuude. I’d watch that in a heartbeat. We’ll probably have something similar soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:25:09
You mean the cash will flow out of Alts into BTC again? LTC got super pumped yesterday

Yep. Then throw it up and eat it again
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:48:40
Scam? Comon' man, do some research and use common sense before throwing FUD around. GDAX was down for a while yesterday with Coinbase. Sometimes it's instant, others can be hours or days. Patience.

Got it, thanks for that. So say I'm using GDAX right now to watch &amp; trade. If I were to install Algominr, does the bot execute the trades for you? Or does it just provide info which I then need to apply on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:38
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:50

In the criminal justice system sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:39:35
I was able to skim about $100 yesterday but down $300 today. Def better to HODL. Was just testing it out and learning real time!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:57:16
Correct me if I am wrong. Does this chart indicate that there are more people looking to buy than sell Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:14:02
Then would it be reasonable to expect a similar phenomena at 12k?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:54:42
I’d nut. Enjoy!

@_date: 2017-11-30 16:05:31
Yeah kill confirmed. I'll buy your coin for pennies on the dollar if you want.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:59:44
Why so?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:55:25
Yes! That is great. It allows a newcomer to enter the market without taking $ out of their own pocket. You're also giving them a potentially infinite amount of value for a 1 time purchase. Keep it up ����
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:14:42
Def still an issue ... I can't withdraw either ...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:01:37
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:11
Ah. Duh. Thanks for the correction. But DAMN!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:16:06
Yes! I've totally been waiting for it to come out Thursday. Hope it helps the market ����
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:37
I had an account but lost my info. Decided to join again to get Bitcoin updates. Sorry guy ..
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:23:04
Tried my hand too. Won a bit. Then played wrong &amp; lost .03 - Gotta learn somehow right??!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:59:22
Cool thank you. I did figure that part out earlier. More specifically, does the higher peak in green mean that more are looking to buy than sell?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:50
Thanks for the tip!!! Gonna sell @ $0!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:13
How’d you do the math? On GDAX there is 47,000 volume at around 10,800. So could be more, but 9b?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:56
I had to add employer info to increase my withdraw allowance. Didn’t have to in order to sign up tho
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:40:14
That will be exactly what I do after today
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:21
Ep isn't til tonight tho! May bring a shit storm ...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:25
Cool, thanks for the tip. I actually see that now watching it live. It's just goin nuts
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:19:40
I’d have to disagree. There are a lot of weak hands in the trade lately. Also, I feel that clients may get some sort of high or brownie points because they’re partaking in a new “trend” which would in turn make it stronger. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:27
I'll admit my hands are sweatin but this is indeed a fun ride
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:33
Ive attempted this myself but still learning. Scraped about $100 yesterday. Down $300 today. All in good fun while learning!
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:35
Can you provide me with more information on this? I understand bots &amp; neural network learning. But is this a tool for day trading? Can it predict change lesser than 60 mins?

Yup. Used this strat to move to a local shelter.
