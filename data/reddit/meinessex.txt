No, CSW is a fraud. He is perfectly capable of writing a white paper, in fact he has written many, so why didn't he write the Bitcoin white paper?
You only need to compare the two different writing styles to know that they were not written by the same man, they are as different as William Shakespeare is from Mark Twain.

Just another Roger Ver scam.

Where did you get this from?
According to their website their coin is decentralised and open source, being based on BitGo.
It also looks like it will be openly traded on the CME markets, so unless I'm missing something, this looks like a good thing, another step towards mainstreaming blockchain technology.

I predict that the date of the Wednesday 17th has been chosen for a reason.
...and when we know exactly why they chose that date, there will be more accusations of insider dealing/shady practices.

Thats the whole point.
...and BTW... its Bcash!

Whenever I read the white paper I notice a distinct lack of Americanisms in the text.
So yes, combined with this level of understanding of British politics and its financial implications, I think he probably is/was British, or at the very least grew up here or was educated here.

Thanks for the heads up, I knew nothing about this, seems there is about to be some huge changes in the UK banking industry.
From that article it doesn't appear that they are using any blockchain at all, just API tech.
If I understand it correctly they will just be doing the same for banking as 'Compare the Meerkats' did for insurance, sounds like some good things are gonna happen, but it also sounds like a security nightmare. A lot of people are not going to be happy about their banking details being open to others in this way.
If it turns into the public relations disaster that I think it might, it could be great for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:05:02
Donny, is that you?
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:50:25
Probably because they know that it will come along with 500 megatons of democracy courtesy of the guy with little hands and a big button.

....which you will then promptly lose when you send your coins to the Bitcoin.com wallet which has a default Bcash receiving address.
As many customers are finding out the hard way, Bitcoin.com is a scam.

This boost in alt coin prices makes BTC look very undervalued right now.
I'm feeling very bullish for the next week or so.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:51:46


I guess that means switching everything to bcash?
They are a Roger Ver company afterall, and he did promise that he would be switching all his companies over to bcash.

I don't particularly like Coinbase, but I have to agree.
There are big things coming, and Coinbase is integral to these things and its vital to the whole Bitcoin world that they survive and thrive.
Sure they have many problems, but these could easily be solved by a simple change of management, I believe its just a matter of time before the real money behind Coinbase (the original venture capital investors) realise this and insist on some major changes starting at the very top.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:21:11
Cool, more coins for the rest of us!
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:48:58
These are all very good points when considering a crypto, so you are not wrong. However, these points are totally irrelevant in this case, heres why...
Firstly its a government owned coin, so you know what you are getting into from the start. But most importantly this coin is a massive test for the crypto world, this coin is called the Petro for a reason, it wants to capture the market and undermine the American 'Petro Dollar'.
Do not underestimate the battle that is about to commence over the petro dollar, the petro dollar is the real reason America goes to war over oil in Iraq, Libya etc. Whichever coin captures this market will be the first crypto to reach the moon, it probably won't be this particular coin, but the release of this coin is a very important 'testing the waters' moment for world politics, its going to be very interesting to see Americas reaction to this.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:29:20


Why does it have to be one or the other?
In my mind they compliment each other perfectly, Bitcoin is giving us unprecedented growth and potential income that is well suited for the long term future, but is high risk.
Gold, doesn't seem to do much for most of the time, but thats good, it brings safety and security to balance out the high risk of Bitcoin. But heres the thing... as Bitcoin rises is popularity, peoples trust in banks will fall, this will drive up the price of gold massively over the next few years.
So whenever I take any profits from my crypto, I take it in gold rather than FIAT.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:58:40
Wouldn't that mean paying more?

It depends on your attitude to risk, you would be exchanging a low risk investment for a high risk investment.
However, the higher the risk, the higher the rewards.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:43:26
They use Coinbase.
This sounds very much like its Coinbases fault, not Overstocks.
And there were rumours that Amazon were going to integrate Coinbase payments sometime in early January, If true it would have been massive for Coinbase, but I guess that won't happen now. 
This is yet another monumental size fuck up from Coinbase.

The most legit place to get started is bitcoin.org, thats the real home of bitcoin, not the .com site.

His writing style is so Aussie you can almost smell the Vegemite.

Yes the amounts money introduced from QE are truly staggering, but it should be noted that not all of it goes directly to the banks, a lot is spent elsewhere, including the Navy who now have a couple of shiny new aircraft carriers thanks to QE.

Either way you look at it, Coinbase are responsible for collecting money on behalf of Overstock, it is their responsibility to ensure that this kind of mistake can't happen. They should have checked and double checked, they didn't, they fucked up.

Only the noobs buying on Coinbase were paying anything direct to Coinbase, all the other fees that people were complaining about went either to their bank in transfer costs, or to the miners in network fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:37:32
Coinbase is already regulated. The relevant authorities are already on to them.

That is until the charities involved find out that they have been pressured into accepting money in the form of a coin run by criminals.
Charities have very strict rules and regulations about whom they can accept money from. In many cases such as this charities are forced to return the money to where it came from.
Something tells me that this is not going to end well.

I have had this message many times, its not Barclays that cancelled your order, its a problem with the Visa/Mastercard network (or whatever card you were using) not forwarding the transaction to your bank account.
Nothing to worry about, it happens with credit/debit cards all the time.

I believe its all done with Put Options, all rather complicated, but its also quite common in the world of currencies. Many smaller countries (such as the Caribbean islands) have their currencies tied to the US Dollar, it gives much needed stability to these smaller countries economies.

With all the accusations of insider dealing I wouldn’t be leaving my money on Coinbase right now. Their customers are fleeing in large numbers, don’t forget what happened to MtGox.

Top right of your GDAX screen (by your username) is their help and support pages, that explains the ‘maker vs taker’ fees pretty simply.

Please don't. There is no need.
All you have to do is withdraw from GDAX not Coinbase, that way there are no fees.

A year? Come on man. Bcash has only existed for 6 months.
And the general consensus was that Coinbase would simply allow customers to withdraw their Bcash, not to fully allow trading of this criminals coin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:28:31
I don't think so, if they allowed purchasing/trading of bcash it would only serve to confuse their customers, most of whom are noobs. It would be the dumbest business decision ever.
Be thankful you are getting your bcash at all, It would have been much better for all if they had gone the Bitmex route and converted everyones shitcoins into BTC whether they liked it or not.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:12:43
No its not.
Its a common misconception that Coinbase is insured and that your funds are safe, but this only applies to funds held as USD (and only upto the first 250k), your crypto assets are not covered at all.
Remember what happened to MtGox, those affected STILL don't have their funds back even after all these years.

Not if its the miners themselves who are doing the spamming, they would get most of their own money back once they mine a block, plus a lot more from all the other users who are paying higher fees because of the spam.
So they are not only sending malicious communications, they are also committing fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:18:38
Wrong, Coinbase ARE regulated. They have to abide by US law, and the law of every other country they trade in.

Well thanks for that, I was quoting from memory when I said that they weren't covered, but I'm sure that those conditions are different from what I have read elsewhere. I will try to find the page I read before. 
Whether they are covered or not is still very ambiguous, I guess they could easily deny liability for any theft, then all loses are down to you.
I do know one thing for sure, I wouldn't trust them to hold onto my funds.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:35:30
Of course the law in every country is different, and this is a new kind of crime, but I'm pretty sure it would be covered by existing laws under computer misuse, malicious communications and denial of service guidelines.

Really? We'll have to disagree on that, my experience tells me that if the OP looks after his watch, it'll probably double in value over the next 5 years or so. You can't say that about the iPhone you have for telling the time.
While its true a high end Tourbillon will probably rise in value more, its only because they are so rare, and price wise they are out of the question for your average collector, so the market is very small, making them difficult to sell. While the OP's Datejust makes a perfect daily wearer (if you like Rolex LOL).

Please answer my question...
How much were you paid to make this post?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:52
No, but its important that those exchanges who are already regulated, eg: Coinbase, stick to those regulations.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:03:42
No, to avoid paying the fees you place your limit order, then just sit back and wait for the market to move, when the price matches your order, your order is filled.
Check out the help pages on GDAX, they explain things better than I could here. Then the next best way to learn is to just do it, but start small until you get the hang of it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:01:53
Merchant integration is clearly one of the next big steps for Coinbase, but Amazon usually prefer to do their own thing, so maybe its just a temporary 'test the waters' thing for them?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:46
Whether this rumour is true or not is largely irrelevant, now it’s out there there is a good chance that it will become a self fulfilling prophecy.
Coinbase need to issue a statement ASAP to refute these claims.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:06
Traders weren't paying any fees (the smart ones using GDAX weren't anyway).
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:37:05
You mean the fees that are higher because of all the SPAM transactions in the mempool? the same SPAM sent by the BCash fanboys just so they can say BTC has higher fees and make their own coin appear cheaper?
By the way....  in almost every country sending SPAM is a criminal offence. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:19:47
Exactly the kind of behaviour I would expect from a coin run by a bunch of criminals.

This is a first for me...  I just upvoted a Bcash thread!
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:36:44
I think you misunderstand what constitutes a maker or a taker.
There is no fee payable if you are 'Maker', ie:placing limit orders to buy or sell at above or below the current price, its this that makes the market price go either up or down.
Taker fees are paid only if you take the current market price. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:25:17

Yes, but consider how much they have been paying out by covering the insane miners fees on withdrawals from GDAX,  I bet that alone has wiped out all their profits over the last few weeks.

No Bitcoin is not in a bubble, many/most suggest that its still under-valued given its future potential.
However, there are other bubbles in the crypto space, the Tether bubble, the Bitconnect bubble, the BCash bubble and the over-valued ICO bubble.
If one or any of these burst it will hurt Bitcoin, no doubt about that, but most people are smart enough to realise that these are not Bitcoin, Bitcoin will survive.

I hate to be pessimistic, but I don’t think it will. 
At least not while Coinbase has BTC pegged to Bcash.  These two coins are direct competitors, their prices need to move independently.
For BTC to make any significant gains the price of Bcash has to move in the opposite way, being pegged to this dead worthless coin is holding us back.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:21:17

Yes their customer service sucks, the fees can be high if you don't know how to avoid them, and they seem to have some rather shady business practices regarding insider dealing etc...
But at the same time its hard to deny that they are also the quickest, easiest and one of the cheapest ways for noobs to get their first Bitcoins.

There is little special about most Rolex, they are all mass produced over priced watches when sold new, but that doesn't stop the collectors going crazy over them, and when Rolex raises the price of their new pieces by 10 percent a year, the price of the vintage watches follows suit, sometimes more so.

@_date: 2017-11-21 09:03:56
The "Network Delays &amp; High Fees" notification is because Bitcoin has been under attack for the last few weeks by people with bad intent, they filled the mempool with SPAM, which drives up the fees and slows the network.
Its nothing to do with Coinbase so your coins are safe (the fees go to the miners, not Coinbase), but its best to withdraw them by using GDAX to avoid the high fees.

I know that, and you know that, but you only have to look at how many posts we get on this forum from noobies who's coins are on the blockchain but haven't yet arrived in their wallet.
Sure they can be recovered, but how many noobs know how to? From their point of view the funds are lost until they can see them in their wallet. 
I have to wonder how many noobs will give up and walk away at this point, and their coins lost forever?
If the decision to make the BCash address the default address was made on purpose for this very reason, then it definitely makes this wallet a scam.

My feeling is that it may take another 48 hours or so.
Good luck though.

Yes, Coinbase are far from perfect, but compared to the alternatives, they are still the cheapest, safest and easiest way for us Brits to get our coins.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:23:30
Well said, and congratulations, you did the right thing.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:21:23
If you want to do a bank transfer to Coinbase, you gotta do it in Euros, they don't take GBP at the mo.
UK debit cards work OK in GBP, but they do have annoyingly small limits for new customers.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:47:05
But not good for my nerves to see fall so far so fast!

Coinbase has its European accounts based in Estonia.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:17:25
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:06:38
I think so, it will destroy customer confidence in the whole sector, many will get burned bad, sell up and never return to crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:10:13
He's right, Tether is a massive bubble that could burst at any time, and when it goes it will have a devastating effect on those exchanges that use it.
But Bitcoin is a mostly separate entity, any altcoin bubble bursting will no doubt drag down Bitcoin with it a little, but Bitcoin will recover.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:34:04
Perhaps the mod misinterpreted your quote because with 432,000 subscribers he no longer feels that we are a "small group".
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:30:06
Unfortunately there are people out there conning noobs into buying their new coin by including Bitcoin in its name and calling it an "upgrade".

Theres a fourth reason too.

Plus GDAX will give you a better price than on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:08:45
The only new money flowing in BCash right now is coming from day traders who smell a quick profit.
Ironically with these pump and dumps, Ver and co are actually destroying their own coin. Who is now going to buy for the long term and actually use it as a currency when its being artificially inflated in this way?
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:55:42
Its probably making him money as it drives up the level of fees he can collect from his mining pools.
Plus not all the SPAM may be coming from him directly, rather its his brainwashed fanboys who are paying the fees for these particular transactions, not realising that sending SPAM is actually illegal.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:54:17
Looks more like an enormous toilet.
Obviously made for some whale, so he can flush his Bcash shitcoins.

Quite apt really for your cat analogy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:29:02
Agreed. There are far too many stories of people being hacked, falling for scams etc. There is still a lot of work to do on improving the security and educating people before we really hit the big time.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:15:09
I did think of setting up a BCash ATM, which would take peoples money, but then pay out in BTC rather than BCH.
It wouldn't be wrong would it? They would thank me in the end wouldn't they?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:50:52


Good advice, but did you really mean to link to one of their sites? I'm afraid I will catch the  plague if I click that link.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:13:53
The price on their dashboard page is not the price you pay, its the median of the spread, halfway between their buy price and sell price. The spread is how they make their money.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:41:11
Maybe, maybe not.
If we're gonna win this war we have got to be polite, courteous and helpful towards all the noobs. Calling them all trollfags is just going to drive them towards all the FUD in the other subreddit.

Whats the real issue here is not the network, that worked just fine until recently, but a few individuals with an evil destructive agenda who are out to line their own pockets. 
And good luck to you too with your centralised coin that will no doubt come under attack one day too!

Looks like the OP has disappeared?  LOL
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:36:14


Really?  You must be the only one who has!
You could have saved yourself a lot of time and heartache by simply reading Coinbases help pages which clearly states that they don't support transfers in GBP. 
Simply use Euros instead, no problems.

I was referring to your belief that 'everyone has a price'.
You need to spend less time staring at the price screens, and educate yourself on the theory behind Bitcoin and its future as the worlds currency, and understand that not everyone has a price.

James Altucher, the fake Amazon rumour guy, I wondered what shit he would come out with next.
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:45:19


It certainly would. Suddenly those predictions of $1million per Bitcoin don't seem so crazy.
My guess would be Nigeria, they top the Google Bitcoin chart and are a massive oil producer.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:43:17
Agreed, well written summary for the newbies.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:35:58
Exactly this, the BCash war is only making them look bad, their attempted hostile take-over of BTC will backfire on them pretty soon.
In the meantime if you want a currency that is fast and cheap, I recommend people use Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:57:00
Now we are past $7.5k I feel its time we had another update.
How's it going?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:35:19
Suggest you find a different mining pool.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:16:13
Yep, its just one big circle that keeps getting bigger and bigger.
But they missed out the bit where they create a fake hack so they can take their profits tax free while appearing to be the victim.

Yes, of course, but don't borrow more than you can afford to pay back if it all goes horribly wrong.

You seem to have missed my point completely.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:01:15
Try kicking up a fuss on Twitter, its much more public than Reddit, will be seen by a lot more people, and therefore more likely to get you a reply from Coinbase support.
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:06:16
Would they use Bitcoin though?

GDAX/Coinbase don't currently accept bank transfers in GBP, you will have to transfer Euros.
UK GBP debit cards work OK though.

Changelly are slow at their best, but with the mempool backlog you may have to wait even longer.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:48:06
I think you need to stop analysing each individual detail of BCash, and see the bigger picture.
The truth is Ver is actively trying to destroy Bitcoin, he wants to send it to zero, he wants to wipe out all $200 billion of peoples hard earned savings, these are real people, real money, yet he shows no shame. Just as long as he can line his own pockets, to do that takes a special kind of evil mentality.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:17:44
Yes, due to the evil twisted minds of the BCash fanatics and their SPAM war.
Don't believe their FUD and lies.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:03:05
Not enough.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:43:13
Exactly, so the big spike we just witnessed over the last few hours was probably mostly European or Asian money. But I expect the yanks were in a rush to get to their desks when they saw that price crashing so fast!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:09:54
So just like FIAT money then!
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:54:02
Get your money out of Bitfinex (and the other exchanges that use Tether).
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:26:56
Good question. Anyone?
In the meantime I would say get your coins off all exchanges, hold your own private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:57:11
Try explaining that to a noob who just saw their money disappear.

People taking their profits.
Many early investors will be reaching their own personal moons at 10k, time to take some profit and re-evaluate their investments.
We've seen it before at major milestones, we will probably see big sell offs around 9900k, but when we do break-through 10k expect a big surge.

And Roger Ver didn't invent Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:27:54

Because they are being paid to.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:35:29
Wrong, both blockchains are using the same miners, the only reason for BTC's slow transactions and high fees is because it is under attack from the bcash fanboys. Once the attack ends and the fanboys disappear the fees and transactions will return to how they were before. You must realise that his attack has been going on for months now, not just this past weekend, its not over yet.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:12:49

Other billionaires seem to survive OK with their own private security guards, so thats not it.
The real danger to Satoshi comes from governments who could see his invention as a subversive attempt to undermine their entire countries economy.
Governments do not like things that they don't understand and tend to over-react with extremely long prison terms. Take Ross Ulbricht as an example. So its no big surprise that Satoshi went dark at Gavin Andresens very first mention of the CIA.

This is no pump and dump.

This will have little to no effect on crypto, if anything its good news for USD.
But who knows what the future holds, if the Saudi oil is now under the control of a company rather than the royal family, maybe, just maybe, one day they will start to sell oil in BTC, but thats a very loooong shot.

The UK really sucks for Bitcoin users at the moment, we are so far behind other countries like the US, South Korea and Japan, theres not a lot of choice when it comes to exchanges. You might find someone on LocalBitcoins willing to deal with you, but only for very small amounts if you can't provide ID etc.
How about getting a few little part time jobs, washing cars, cutting grass etc, and ask to be paid in Bitcoin?
That way your parents can't be too upset about you going against their wishes and buying your coins (they probably think you want it to buy drugs etc). By working for coins it shows you have initiative and they will be proud of you.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:32:17

It is free. 
GDAX cover the cost.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:00:12
Logically it has to be whomever has the most to gain from doing so.
So who do we know who owns huge mining pools with a hash rate that gives them an advantage over any other? Who owns a rival coin that stands to benefit from BTC's high Tx charges? And who owns a large network of PR companies and websites who are constantly spreading FUD about BTC's costs and trying to convince the public to use their coin instead?

Are you sure you didn't send your BTC to a Bcash wallet by mistake? That seems to be a common problem with Bitcoin.com customers (thats all part of the scam), if this is the case your money is lost, if not it will probably arrive eventually, along with the highest possible fees, when they think you have waited long enough.

@_date: 2017-09-15 20:20:48
I don't think they are being forced to sell, its just that they can't sell or trade after the exchanges close. More likely that they will choose to hold until the Chinese government changes their mind and allows the exchanges to reopen.

They won't cash out all at once, they would be stupid to, rather they will start to spend their profits gradually. This will be good for Bitcoin, it will reduce the volatility in  the markets, which in turn will encourage more vendors to accept Bitcoin.

Good advice from Fenton.
I will just add this, be aware of whatever fees you are paying, less fees equals more Bitcoin.
Use an exchange like GDAX to buy the dips, get some buy orders in way below the current market rate and just wait, the price always seems to dip whenever you are asleep, this way you won't miss out.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:02:50
Heres hoping you are right. Bitcoin was obviously created during the last financial crises, but its not really been tested in this way since its birth. 
We might see the price drop due to lots of Bitcoiners cashing out if they find they really need the cash to pay bills etc.?

Unlikely we will see a big crash anytime soon. There is now so much new money coming into Bitcoin from both private individuals and major institutions, that any dip over 5% is seen as a buying opportunity, forcing the price back up again.

There is no doubt the ICO bubble will burst at some point, and that it will badly hurt the price of Bitcoin, however for me the question is not 'how much' the price will crash, but for 'how long'?
After a major crash it could be many many years before consumer confidence returns enough to resume investment in crypto currencies, and by that time the whole crypto world will have moved on, there is no telling that Bitcoin will still be the 'the one'.

America has lost the respect of the world, and with it they have lost all their power, China now sets the agenda at all the major talks.
And the US' biggest problem is that they totally fail to see what is at the root of all their biggest issues.... the political lobbyist system they have in Washington, its to blame for everything from gun control to abortion rights. How they have the bare faced cheek to call their country a democracy is beyond me. 
America is one of the least democratic and most corrupt countries in the world. Right now it more closely resembles a facist dictatorship. 
And this what you want for Bitcoin? You want to actively encourage this kind of bribery and lobbying of politicians in Washington? No thanks, not the kind of Bitcoin I want to see.

So its gonna be a double whammy, a triple whammy if you include the weak dollar and weak pound, the perfect storm, a crash of unseen proportions is coming very soon.
The good news is...  this is exactly why Satoshi invented Bitcoin during the last big crash. This will be Bitcoins big test, if it survives and performs well (as it should), we will reach the moon sooner than you think.

We are now 3 months after the hard fork and people are still waiting for their BCH. 
It also looks like they will NEVER receive their Bitcoin Gold, and its still uncertain wether they will end up getting their BTC "upgraded" into x2 coins against their wishes.
Combine these issues with Coinbases lack of customer support and you can see the problem.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:12:21
Coinbase. 
I hate to recommend them for their stance over the various hard forks and their lack of customer service, but the fact remains that they are still the cheapest, safest and easiest way to buy coins.

Badly written article, yes, but this is still good news. This is Sky news' first real story on the Bitcoin phenomenon, a sign that people are starting to take notice in the UK.

@_date: 2018-02-09 14:09:28
For bitcoin(dot)com, yes its normal, they are a scam site.
They support bcash, so they want anyone who uses BTC to have the worst possible experience.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:05:14
Buy more.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:59:29
But they only accept Bcash for their chip sales, so these figures must be converted from their Bcash holdings? Their profits from chip sales are closely intertwined with the profits from creating and pumping of their scamcoin. So its impossible to say if these figures are legitimate or not, the numbers were probably magic'd out of thin air to keep their investors and the Chinese government happy. Just one more part of the whole scam.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:51:06
And how much of that is due to the appearance of Bcash?
Its hardly a big surprise, when you are printing your own money why would you stop at a small number?

About time they had another pump. Sell while you can, the dump is coming.
The truth is, bcash should have a lower marketcap than Litecoin and Dash, the price won't settle at this level. Its still got a long way to fall.

And the reason why they WILL adopt Bitcoin are the same reasons you give above. 
Its no hassle at all for Amazon to accept a new currency, they already accept dozens of different currencies from all over the world.
Its an appreciating asset, what big retailer wouldn't want its vast cash reserves working for it, increasing value giving them increasing buying power with their suppliers. 
Plus those people who have been holding long enough to have significant gains... those are the kind who are the biggest spenders, might be a small percentage now, but its growing fast, just what they need for future growth.
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:53:16
I think the next financial crisis will see a few more noobs come into Bitcoin, but because crypto has a steep learning curve for your average computer illiterate Joe, they will probably be too late to rescue their savings from any run on the banks. 
But people will wise up, they won't get fooled twice, by the time of the next crisis after that, everyone will know about crypto, and most will be hodling. So it will be then that Bitcoin gets to the Moon.

Its all relative to your situation. Not everyone can or will ever get to own a whole coin. 
I'm sure that there are Bitcoiners living in rural Africa that could retire early if they just sold a couple of goats and invested enough to buy 0.1 of a Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-14 14:49:47
How do you define "current adoption"? The number of Bitcoin users is growing massively every day, Coinbase alone is adding over 30,000 new customers every day. The value of Bitcoin is simply showing the demand, the market sets the value. This is completely natural growth.
Compare that the many of the alt coins, who are valued in the billions, yet have no product, zero income, nothing but a white paper full of ideas most of which they will probably never deliver on. Now THATS a bubble.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:23:43

Why is all this energy used seen as such a bad thing?
Only a small percentage comes from burning fossil fuels these days (even in China they are increasingly using less coal and more hydro and solar).
I prefer to think of all those Bitcoin created by the miners that are being spent by the energy companies on increasing wind and solar plants, all the new jobs being created in the power industry, and all the money that is trickling down into the general economy. 
With the world population growing fast, we need more and more energy, if Bitcoin can bring that energy to the places where its most needed, such as poorer parts of China and Russia, thats a good thing right?

The last fork was a hostile fork, so any data will not really be comparable. Although it may come in useful for the Segwit2x fork which is also a hostile fork.

All exchanges will make you jump through hoops to get registered, they have legal obligations to prevent money laundering etc.
Coinbase/GDAX is the least troublesome out of all those I have tried.

"A Vietnamese man walked into the currency exchange in New York City with 2 million vietnam dong and walked out with $100. The following week, he walked in with another 2 million vietnam dong, and was handed $84. He asked the teller why he got less money that week than the previous week. The teller said, "Fluctuations." The Vietnamese man stormed out, and just before slamming the door, turned around and shouted, "Fluc you Amelicans, too!""

Thread title is misleading. I don't think he is saying he no longer supports B2X. In reality he supports anything that can harm or destroy Bitcoin.

Well done him.

My vision sometimes goes a little like that too, usually when I'm drunk.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:39:07
Totally agree, but at the moment Bitcoins utility is being severely hampered by malicious attacks on its hashrate, causing high fees and slow confirmations.
We need to wait until these issues are resolved before we start promoting and educating, or we risk alienating the average end users who should be coming aboard.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:39:50
If you really think this will happen then you should keep your forked coins as a hedge. But IMHO the longer you keep them the more chance they will crash to zero.

PSA to citizens of the World: Americans make up only 4.4 percent of the world population, don't let them control ALL the Bitcoins. Get yours before all the Yanks snap them up.

I'm pretty sure they have the funds, rumours are that they are sitting on vast quantities of bcash that they have mined at a loss, so they really need a big pump in order to dump it all at a half decent price. My thoughts are that they will do this around the time of the 2X fork in order to create maxium FUD for BTC.

Yes, you can receive coins when you are offline, as the coins never actually leave the blockchain.
But they won't appear in your wallet until you do go back online.

How exactly do you trade Bitcoin on a STOCK exchange?

Brittrex is just another exchange, so the answer is no.

Unfortunately exchanges like GDAX won't let us Europeans deal in USD, so we are stuck with EUR or GBP.

@_date: 2017-10-11 14:05:29
Can't you sell your BCH directly on bitcoin.de?
Transferring to another wallet will entail network charges, and shapeshift is not the cheapest way to convert to BTC.

Why would they sell? Why miss out on free money?
BitcoinGold is a friendly fork, so nothing to worry about, its no threat to BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:31:08
Why not use that free money to gain even more free money in the upcoming hardforks?
Its a no brainer.

True, but we aren't dealing with kids here. These are straight up conmen, one of whom believes he is the second coming.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:04:23
And after the hard fork, I guess you also owe an equal amount of Bcash?

So nothing new there then.

Transfer your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX then send out to your wallet from there... zero fees!

Glad you have seen the light and converted, but just out of interest, why were you against Bitcoin before?
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:28:04
Maybe use your BTC to buy gold sovereigns, they are classed as legal tender in the UK and are tax free.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:46:25
Its what people say when they don't know what else to say because they haven't a clue what they are talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:24:54
Nope, if anything Bitcoin is still waaay under-valued given its massive future potential.
Alt coins ICO's on the other hand....  when that bubble bursts it will inevitably drag down Bitcoin with it, only the strongest will survive.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:32:16

Its a currency, how is it different?
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:31:28
I'm guessing you will soon be getting some 'dividends' from the upcoming hard forks?
How about spending some of that on buying the whole class a Champagne breakfast, quality bubbly with canapés etc...
Then when he asks you how much it all cost, you turn round and reply 'nothing', then you could tell him about all the free money you received in addition to your enormous portfolio gains, that should be enough to blow his mind!
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:24:50
No fees if you use GDAX, their trading website, and you get a better price than the Coinbase site.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:18:28
...or then again, it might not!
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:45:32
Yeah, thats pretty much the same hurdles we need to overcome with everyone else before Bitcoin achieves mass adoption. It may take a while, but we will get to the Moon eventually.
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:44:23
The fall in the price of BCH is dragging them down, they shoulda dumped that shit, but no, they kept it, they even plan to open a new fund to support it. Crazy.
Seems they can't sell their bcash  without upsetting some of their investors.
My advice, get out fast, before the next fork, that will drag the fund down even further.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:03:11
If you went to Tesco's to buy your groceries, and they asked you to pay in Vietnamese Dong, what would you do? You'd probably just walk out and go to Waitrose instead.

Greed. Pure greed, fuelled by hatred. They wanted more, more, more, and they got it, but it turns out that nobody else wanted it, so its worth less. A lot less.

I think Bitcoin 'aint settling anywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:10:01
Yes, and thats where Bitcoins massive future potential comes from. Therefore, no bubble! Just because you *think* the price is high right now, doesn't make it so! In another year or so you will wish you had bought more at this price.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:55:00


There is an element of that from some of the city boys, but I get the impression that most of those interviewees who are asked about Bitcoin, simply don't get it yet.
Crypto has a steep learning curve, and the Brits are way behind other countries, the US news outlets like FOX, NBC and Bloomberg now have practically daily coverage, (especially when the price spikes) and I think it clearly shows with rising US adoption rates.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:05:20
I'm pretty sure Coinbase will continue to sell BTC, if they drop BTC or 'upgrade' customers coins to the 2x coin, they will be committing corporate suicide.

At least wait for Apple to release the new iPhone X in a couple of weeks.
But it depends on your attitude to risk, stocks like Apple are pretty low risk, Bitcoin is high risk AND very volatile, but high risk does equal higher rewards.
