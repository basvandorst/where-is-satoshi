Sounds to me that, like this ignorant Peter Shiff guy, you also don't know shit about how the exchanges work, and are just ignoring that a major point of his argument for BTC to drop in value, was completely wrong in stating that, you can't take shorts on bitcoin.

Ok, questions:
1 - A deflactionary currency system, by default, creates unemployment since there is already a reward just by keeping your money stored, you don't need to invest it in order to increase your wealth. That happened in Japan a short time ago for instance, and it's well documented.
So, please explain how is that bitcoin will reduce unemployment, when history and logic tell us that will in fact increase it.
2 - If bitcoin does take the power away from the state you may argue that will prevent the state from waging wars and controlling people so much. But what about the people that would control bitcoin then? We all know there are some wallets, whoever they belong to, that store a huge percentage of bitcoin compared to what have been produced. So, why should we wish to transfer the control from the government (in which at least we can vote on)  to some bitcoin billionaires? What would we gain from that?
These are valid questions I think. And it could be nice if for once people could discuss them rationally in this forum instead of entering in  half baked arguments depending if you are pro or anti bitcoin.

How the hell can it happen just once?
It's simple maths. A selloff down to 1 USD, even in several exchanges needs a much smaller volume than the amount of coins in the big wallets.
The top 12 wallets have together 1 million BTC. 1 million! That's enough to crash the price to 1 USD in all 4 major exchanges at the same 10 times and assuming that people would be dumb enough to bring the price up to the present rate every time after.
It's about maths, it's not opinions.

Yes, *"practical ramifications"*:
- Major world ignorance since only rich can pay for education
- Major world epidemics, since only rich can pay for any form of healthcare
- Major environmental breakdown and/or a massive decrease of world population trough disease since poor people will obviously not be willing to pay for stuff like **sewage treatment** and **proper garbage disposal and treatment of non recyclable waste**
- Outright violence since there will be no taxes to pay for a police force accountable to the citizen. Mercenary forces will abound but with no real necessity to abide by any community rules, descending into predation of weaker populations from time to time.
- No courts of law with any validity since there would be no universally accepted set of rules (Even locally) and you would have no way to enforce them against a powerful perpetrator/group of perpetrators. Opening the doors to any kind of violence, theft, intimidation, abuse and even outright enslavement of weaker individuals or communities.

It's wrong to expect that the market actors are moved by rationality. They are not, like game theory explains, the players are moved by maximising their profits.
So, if one player could gain 1000 USD by making the other players loose 1 million USD, the player would indeed play that position, since he cares not for the overall gain but for it's own personal profit.
This is what you are seeing here, and this behaviour it's not going to stop unless enforced somehow.

I still have to see someone sensibly explaining why debt (cause that's why we become slaves of the banks, it's not because we keep our money there) will be eliminated by bitcoin.
By changing the paradigm from paper money to bitcoin, you are just transferring the control of capital from the state (and the banks) to bunch of other very wealthy individuals (read, early adopters of bitcoin), so what does the overall population have to win from that?
No, I don't trust the state to be honest, but sincerely, I trust it to be less dishonest that some hypothetical bitcoin anonymous overlords.

You see, the fact that Krugman is arrogant (and I easily admit he is) doesn't make him wrong, nor does it make his ideas less socially correct.
He was right about many things in this crisis. And like the article you actually point, he was also right in the post crisis. Europe was indeed recovering better than the USA until Germany completely shut down the stimulus and instead asked for more austerity. Krugman predicted the impact that would have, and look at us now... the guy was completely right.
And let's face it, his policies are much more "human" than the policies asked from the people that usually bash him. Krugman was trying to create jobs, to invest in the industry, the other opposing thoughts, only asked for more austerity and for saving banks no matter what the social costs.
Let's be intellectually honest here, people in this subreddit are only bashing him because he bashed bitcoin.

Still, as we all know, primitive tribes that don't use money quarrel with each other all the time. In fact in the book that's referred some times. For instance when he says that if a tribe thinks they where cheated in a trade with another tribe they may take to arms to claim their trade back.
Bitcoin stoping war is a ridiculous notion. Even more, because bitcoin **is** a currency.

Nonsense. These countries never had *extreme inflation* before the Euro era, at least not under democracy.
A government needs to be able to control it's currency, and it's not the one sided case you only see, of producing more money to avoid default. 
There are many mechanisms in action here, like for instance reducing imports and increasing exports by devaluating the currency a bit.

Completely true, but what I worry about is not that money you are not spending in other good in order to buy bitcoin. My worry, is, once you have bitcoin, that you don't **invest** money to create a new enterprise for instance. Since, by having a guaranteed profit just by letting your coins sit in storage, you would not be willing to take risks (or at least no so many risks) by using those BTC to start a new venture.

Typical housing price 1960 ~ 15000 USD
Typical housing price 2014 ~ 120000 USD
Bottom line: Houses are cheaper, compared to salaries, you are taking more time to raise money to pay for them, cause you consume a lot more.

The circle jerk in although I have to admit, it diminished a bit these last couple of months.
You see, quite some people in actually have some bitcoins, but they are sane enough to admit that bitcoin:
-  it's not going to 10K during 2014 (like many where calling here)
- it's never going to be the world currency, since nations states actually need to keep control of the currency in order to have a sane economy (just think about the biggest problem with euro for 5 minutes).
- it has lots of practical problems that actually need to be solved before it reaches a bigger audience, instead of trying to pass the message that's bitcoin is already perfect.
So, buttcoiners are (or where until finally gained some sense these past weeks) mostly the sane part of bitcoin for a while.
Also, they know how to take a joke.

You don't. It's bitcoin, remember?
You use it because you want to be outside the awful arm of the state that bullies citizens to follow the laws put in place by the fat cats in Wall Street.
You use it because regulation is the way the state has to prevent a new more effective economy to take over the old one controlled by the lobbing groups in Washington DC.
You use it because the state owned printing machine is making the dollar worthless and taking away your hard earned money with inflation.

Still less that 10% of all bitcoin in existence are being trader or used to buy anything, practically all of them are just sitting since the beggining. So, seems like the price it's still way high.

Spread for my CC (which is a completely basic one) is 0.33% for the most important currencies (i.e. EURGBP, EURUSD, EURSEK), I never bothered to check other cards since this seems acceptable for me and my transaction volume.
For BitPay, depends on the time period, but it's always higher (sometimes much higher). Also, the effect is multiplied by 2 if your currency is different from the receiving currency (this 2x factor is not applicable if you are using your bitcoin directly).
You can check a discussion about the subject here (although a bit long):
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:37:28
If you could pull up a 51% attack, you could validate transaction that never happened. So you could, for instance validate a transaction of 10000 BTC to your address that never happened.
Let's say that the price would fall 90% because of this attack... you would still be taking home 600k USD in the end if you could pull this off.

~~1st, eBay doesn't take anywhere near 10% for fees. In fact, in the same page you presented there is nothing remotely similar.~~
Still, if you add PayPal fees to the auction fees, I recognise you can end up paying almost 7.5% fees.
But how do you propose to change that?
I actually hate eBay as a seller (not only the high fees) but the way I can be easily screwed by an non honest buyer. But I love eBay as a buyer. I pay with PayPal and I'm indeed protected.
So, how do you propose to make people use an alternative if you don't protect the buyers, and how are you going to protect the buyer if you don't charge the sellers fees to maintain the system?
EDIT: My bad. eBay does indeed take 10% of the price now. The OP is right, this got completely out of hand.

People don't realize (or down' want to realize) that if **1%** of the BTC in existence was sold right now, **all** the exchanges would go back to close to 10 USD.
That's fcking insane. And on the same side, if someone decided to put 1% of the current value of bitcoin in USD into the market, the price would jump to +1000 USD in **all** the exchanges.
This is just plainly crazy, the degree of manipulation in price of bitcoin is insane, and that's why many people frown at using this as a payment method.

Perhaps you don't understand math, but **median** is not the same as **average**.
So why don't you compare the median in 1960 and in 2014?
EDIT: And since you are nitpicking, being that the diference today for the median and and average is not so different as to break my point, you should also post the diference in size between the average (or median) area of the house in 1960 and 2014... that way it's still way more apparent that house prices are actually much cheaper now than in 1960 when compared to the wages.

1st of all, thank you for answering in a rational matter to the questions. I disagree in some point tough, and I will proceed to express them.


I must disagree with that particular point. Everything points to American edge on todays wold have been built on investment, not savings.


Again, I do agree, that sound money rewards savings. But I fail to see how it boosts capital investment. And worst, how it drives innovation. If, by leaving your money stale without use, you could increase the purchasing power of your money by 10% per year, surely there wouldn't be a so much importance in investing your money, either by creating jobs or even by lending it to someone that could create those jobs. And the same applies to R&amp;D.


I hope so, but deep down that's not very different from increasing inflation. I know that to public perception is easier to sell the idea of low taxes and then for the sate to print money. But in the end, in that regard, it's exactly the same. Why wouldn't the state just raise taxes in a bitcoin economy in order to maintain control?
Of course that in that case it would have the great benefit of the money one would personally loose, would just end up in the state, instead of today picture where inflation makes the money we loose end up in the state, but also in the deep pockets of the banking system.

Oh trust me, I keep telling the same over and over again. In this subreddit it's basically impossible to have a proper conversation because what this people care is only the price and most of them don't even actually know the basics about the protocol.
Problem is, that's being exploited and traders (people that see BTC as only a speculative asset and not as a technology) are using that sentiment of this subreddit (**get very rich, very quickly**) and completely and consistently disrupting the market to their profit. That in turn negatively affects public opinion, which creates a vicious cycle.
That is the sole reason I started as a bitcoin enthusiast (having actually converted at least 3 of my friends) some years ago, and now I stopped believing it. What I'm seeing in bitcoin is exactly what I see with the normal financial system. Greed, deceit and the creation of a wealthy elite that does anything they have to do in order to stay at the top.
Hope there some way to turn things around. If not, in some years people will look back and see bitcoin as the great mass psychology experiment that explained that any monetary system eventually collapses due to internal manipulation by it's biggest players... but on a much lower time frame.

No, not really.
The OP didn't specified exactly the issue and since there are 2 of them, I answered the relevant one.
**So, here it goes the really long answer:**
You can always easily change the cryptographic algorithm for signing transactions in the bitcoin protocol (it uses elliptic curve now). That's the one that's potentially insecure to quantum computers as far as we know at the present.
But you cannot change the mining algorithm in the bitcoin protocol (it uses SHA-256). So, that's the one that will be really bad in case quantum computing is able to "crack it", and that's also the one I was answering.

Damn, guess it's back to Astrology for me to predict the BTC future price.
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:42:49
Because price was artificially inflated.
Bitcoin needs many people buying at some stable level for a long, long time, so that the big wales actually start using/trading 99% of the bitcoin that are simply not in circulation in the hopes the price always gets higher and higher.
Until then, you can just expect these pumps and dumps.

@_date: 2014-10-08 23:58:34


Well, this is subject to much debate. Depends on if you are a Keynesian or not.
You can argue that under a devalued currency that yes, people are poor because they cannot afford new cars/smartphones/fashion clothes/etc.
Or you can argue that under a devalued currency while they cannot afford high end products, this way they don't have a real crisis in the country and they all have housing/food/jobs.
Of course that the best scenario would be for the country to be able to pay it's debts and have a strong currency. But when one of those ain't possible. You are face with, either keep a strong currency and default/ask for a big loan (what's happening now in southern Europe), or devalue the currency and be able to pay your debts.
I believe that controlling the currency it's the best for the country and it's citizens in overall. Although it does negatively affect a small part of the population. Unfortunately Southern Europe lost the power to decide if they want to do that or not.

Just go to any exchange (BFX for instance) and open the extended order book (there's a special page just for that). There on the last column you have the cumulative BTC/USD needed until that position is reached.
Then just go to blockchain info (for instance) and check the amount of BTC in existence at a given moment.
Then it's simple math.
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:02:56
You are telling me that the talkers at the Bitcoin summit expect the price to go up? No way man!
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:00:29
Ok, I stopped listening at:
- *"There are no exchanges where you can borrow bitcoin and go short"*
Right after another pearl of complete ignorance:
- *"In bitstamp you can now put selling stops and the market manipulators can see your stops in the order book".*
This tells me exactly how absolutely ignorant this idiot talking like he knew something is.
First, the stops don't show up in the order book. But ok, the guy could be wrong about that not so big detail.
But then, he has to be completely clueless and ignorant to tell you you cannot take a short on bitcoin when - **by very, very far** - all the highest trading exchanges, except bitstamp, allow shorts ranging from 2.2x to 10x leverage.
**So, this Peter Schiff if an ignorant. Nuff said**

@_date: 2014-11-05 12:10:52
Maximum leverage is 2.5-4 times in most places.
True, BTC futures have a 10x leverage on 796 or OKcoin Futures. But still, you would need a &gt; 30$ change for them to trigger... besides, their volume is quite small.

Ask your grandparents if they had lunch in a restaurant every single work day like you probably do and most americans certainly do now-a-days.

Thank you for your completely black and white image of the world.
Sadly, the rest of us can think about the complexities of the problems and see the issues that come with illegal drug sell, like the alteration of the product that may cause health harm to it's users.
And we also see the issues even with legal drug sell, like the source of the product and how it came to be (yes, Mexico would surely be a paradise in case drugs where legal and they ramped up production).
So, since everything is so easy to solve for you, I don't really have anything else to discuss with you since your ideas about running this complex problem that affects a big part of the word population in one way or another, are so straightforward and simple, and yet, no country in the world had someone of your intellectual calibre to tell them how easy it is to solve the problem.

This vicious circle with the weaker European economies will just go on and on until EU get's it's shit together and the fault lies exactly in the fact that these countries stopped being able to control their own currency.

Man, do the maths of coins in existence vs order books. It can happen dozens of times at least.
The reason the price is so ridiculously high, is because the large majority of the coins are not being used for transactions.
The moment one of those accounts decided to use the coins, the business accepting them, will just convertem to USD and crash the price. That's what every business does (Dell, Virgin, NewEgg), they get someone coins and right away put them in USD, so those coins are indeed locked or the moment they are moved they will crash the price.

The rest of the world is actually not obsessed with the price like you obviously are and then proceed to come here and bash the others that talk about the price in a negative way, when you are obviously praying to all the saints that it goes up a bit so that you don't lose a boat load of money.

Predicting the price of bitcoin ahead of a very short term future seems totally inaccurate for me.
In any case, if that is true, at least it will have a positive outcome.
From then on, every time there is a crash, you can't have people coming here and say: "So what, it's still x times up since last year.". Some rationality will ensue finally.

Yes, we all knew that Scotland was going to adopt Bitcoin as their national currency obviously, so the state controlled media and the big capital that controls the world, initiated a massive campaign against the secession of Scotland so that they could keep controlling the state owned money making machine.
Still, my fellow bitcoiners, only 10% of Scottish failed to see the light. We are getting there. Next is Catalonia, now that would be the bitcoin utopia, I can already imagine the jugglers and human statues in Las Ramblas with a QR code in front of their spot for you to be able to tip them.

Your maths don't add up, or you made a typo when you wrote: *"I don't mind getting less btc if the value remains same in the dollar amount"*
If you paid 1.2 BTC for 1K and then asked for a refund and the BTC price drooped, you would receive 1.2 BTC and it would be worth less than 1K by then end.
Perhaps you meant that you don't mind losing some USD as long as you get the same amount of BTC?

The bacteria uses gold chloride. What you said would be the same as saying that Sodium would be unlimited because some bacteria can break up sodium chloride.

I disagree. People are under the false impression that it's governments that wage war. But that's not true since liberalism. For more than 1 century now, wars exists because big economic groups want them to exists. They create the reasons for those wars to exist, they finance those wars and in the end they rip the profits from them.
With bitcoin it would be exactly the same. Some bitcoin billionaires would just finance a war they deemed profitable for them.
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:32:15
I think the fact that people in this subreddit are incapable of rationally discussing any possible problem with BTC (like this 51% imminently possible - but not probable - attack) in the hopes that if they refuse to talk about the bad things, those things just magically disappear, are the reason you have all these posts.
And by posting this thread you just proved my point.

It's actually highly over valued when you consider that less than 10% of all bitcoin is existence are being traded or used to buy anything.

Yes, it's an illustrative day to people that complain about inequality of ownership in bitcoin but because of the exact opposite reason.
These last days are just proving that the bitcoin overlords that have 90% of the market volume and control all this cannot be trusted.
Worst case scenario, I prefer to trust in the central banks as bad as they might be than in some kids that mined millions worth of BTC with their parents electricity in the early days.
After all, since we don't have a say in neither scenario, I least I prefer the regulated and that - at least in part - responds to the democratic process, central bank authority.

@_date: 2014-08-14 13:41:29
If it's really good (like validated good, not some rumour some guy bought 30K BTC at 700 USD in an auction), then the price should jump up quickly and then slowly continue going up.
Exactly the opposite when going down.
When you see the price jumping/crashing on no news, or on rumours (good or bad, but still unconfirmed rumours), then pay  attention, it will probably be a pump followed by a dump or vice versa.
Finally. When you have long periods of sideways, with no good/bad news, you should expect people to start selling sooner or later. BTC is highly speculative and if people don't see their money increasing they usually get out after a while.

No, bitcoin is actually doing quite well (look at the new projects that are being created with it and the new business accepting it).
It's the price that it's going down and it's long overdue. Price it's artificially high after great manipulation (if 1% of all BTC where sold right now, **all** the exchanges would automatically go to 10 USD, don't even need cascades or panic, just the act of selling those 1% would do it) and needs to get back to acceptable levels.

The difficulty only increases exponentially because the network hashing power also does it.
If everyone was still mining in their home computers instead of dedicated ASIC miners, the difficulty would remain the same. Although the reward would be smaller by now.

About the article:
The article you posted is quite dishonest. Krugman was not wrong about his prediction, he predicted things correctly about Europe **while** Germany did what he expected them to do. When they instead invested in more austerity, he also predicted that would end up bad and that was also correct. So, what was Krugman failure there actually?
He praised social democracy and it's economical benefits, but Europe failed when they rejected that same social democracy. So again, in what he was wrong actually? They guy is an economist, not a politician, he doesn't set the course for those countries.
Now as of lately he is casting a bad cloud over the future of Euro. And well, just look at the news, UK sentiment is more and more anti-european. Germany government is pro euro, but german people is more and more anti-euro. So, again, is it fetched to say the Euro is healthy? Doesn't that go exactly against the article opinion that Europe economy is in a bad shape to say that the Euro is here to stay?

I think that for a society allowing drugs or not, is a rather complex issue where many points of view may be correct.
I'm actually in favour of legalising light drugs (cannabis, mescaline, salvia, etc, which are already legal in my country) and continuing the ban in hard ones (cocaine, meth, heroin, etc), although I can understand the reasoning behind different points of view.
Still, the illegal sale of drugs is by itself a bad thing, no matter how you look at it, SR2 is clearly making a dis-service to society in this regard.

1st point, I'm European, not American.


This is a complete hyperbole. True, they are a dictatorship and they do violate human rights. But they are not, by a long margin amongst the most oppressive. In fact Pinochet regimen was way more brutal than the Cuban one, and was sponsored by the USA for decades.
Then, the reason we cut some slack to Cuba for decades was because the only option for most of the countries there, was to be a right wing oppressive regimen, where the dictator was a puppet of the USA, that many times got to be in power because CIA overthrew the previously democratic elected president (i.e. Salvador Allende).
So Cuba, for most of the free world, was the less of two evils, since we saw Americas bullying of South America as a despicable thing and saw Cuba as the little one that sanded up to them and showed them middle finger.
Since the end of the cold war and the democratisation of the governments in South America, Cuba's reason for its present state are vanishing, but some of us still remember why it got to be like this.

Still baffles me how people don't understand the differences:
1 - Internet wasn't born as internet but as lots of different in house projects, the biggest of which was ARPANET. So, even in the case that cryptocurrencies actually persist, your 1 BTC will be as worthless as ARPANET is today since BTC will be replaced by something much more advanced and universally used.
2 - Bitcoin has only one - although admittedly huge - purpose. Internet has a multitude of them, and as such allows innovation to occur in a widely range of areas, and that is most probably the reason to be such a successfully technology, as such it's a completely different example than bitcoin.

Well, I think it's obvious. By devaluating the currency, for this particular aspect, they make people buy less foreign, and as such, since having a weak currency, expensive goods.
At the same time, since the work is cheap (compared to external goods), but the wages stays up to date with the 1st necessity goods these countries already produced by themselves, people are not in poverty. After all, they can afford housing, food, and basic goods easily.
At the same time, they produce for cheap (again, compared to foreign goods), so the country has a lot of these agricultural, and fishing goods available for exporting.
That equilibrates the import/export balance, or even pushes it to benefit these countries.

No, it doesn't break my point because you are comparing MEDIAN house prices with AVERAGE wages. I'm really starting to see this is a very complicated issue to some people, that you can't compare apples and oranges.
And while you are at it, like I said, remember that the house size increased, so in fact, even more to weight to my point, if you see the increase in wage vs the increase in housing price per sq meter, you will see that houses are way more cheaper now a days than in the 60's, either you compare - **everything, not parts of it** - using the median or the average.
EDIT: IT decreased a bit in the last decade, but increased a lot since the 70's.

I hope you do realize that the absolute minimum you have to pay with bitcoin to do the same with an western currency is 0.5% + 1 USD to carry out the same thing.
And that's assuming the spread would be close zero in your transaction, which, let0s face it, it never ever is (at best you can hope for a 2.5 USD loss per bitcoin) in any western exchange.
In fact there was a nice post here about 1 month ago, of some guy that tried to transfer some money with Western Union and with bitcoin and in the end the bitcoin transfer ended up costing him more when putting it all in USD again.
