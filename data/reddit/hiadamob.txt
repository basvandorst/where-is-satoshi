We need your skills at our Halloween party up in Canada ����
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:44:53
How are your accepting it? Wallet app?
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:49:14
Are you settling to your bank or holding the coins?
@_date: 2019-04-14 01:30:10
That's awesome. I gave my buddy's kid $20 in 2015. It's doing well for him lol
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:52:30
We have a free system that would allow you accept. Would love some feedback if your interested 
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:03:34
Well we'd have a hard time contacting you if you won...

Working on LN support, it has to be a lot more stable before we merchants can trust it though
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:45:01
canadian merchants can use our processor 
We are working on adding more fiat currencies for spot pricing. 
Auto conversion coming soon too OR set your own address and just HODL

Yea - the prize is in Canada and contest law in USA is crazy. 
Send us an email to lilachouse.win so we can follow up RE corps. I don't see why not, but then again I'm not a lawyer
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:01:23
In what way? Would love to prove otherwise... I think our rules and  transparency do a pretty good job. What are you worried about?
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:59:33
Would love to prove otherwise - how can I do that?
- Adam
- Guy running the contest.

- you can verify the price with the method chosen in 2-3 minutes. Open 3 browser tabs, get the price of our 3 chosen sites and do some simple addition/division. Very very easy. 
- the point of the contest is to predict the price of bitcoin, not answer a question. Again, the question is there for legality. I think you have missed the point of why we are running the contest. Further, I think we legally have to give "due time" to answer the question leaving the answer very findable online 
- Agreed. It's highly unlikely the masses are going to want bitcoin as a refund. Pretty sure PayPal allows for mass refunds in a similar way. You are thinking about a Bitcoin community, not a normie one.

Didn't see your entry ;)

Yea it doesn't seem that people (especially in this space) are willing to trust anyone online. We have it set up as transparent as possible and worked with lawyers who were comfortable being publicly listed in order to give entrants confidence. Need to work on proving legitimacy. Easier said than done...
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:14:25
It is. But we can still Find and recreate pain points that we need to either work around or redo 
LN is where btc was in 2013 I find. There's a handful of beta platforms that work, but no one has set a nice precedent for proper development
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:57:53
Hey! This is a great breakdown. I'm the one running the contest and will address these points
- I thought we had it listed in the rules, but obviously not. The tie breaker is "price is right rules" where if 2 entries are 0.01 away the winner will be the prediction BELOW the actual price. will avdvise the lawyers and update the rules.
- We prevent this by taking an average of 3 exchanges (1 being Bitstamp USD/BTC and converting based on the CAD/USD rate) and the other being bitcoinaverage.com CAD value. This formula is listed on  and also in the rules (point 5)
- Again, we are doing our best to avoid manipulation. There would have to be a significant amount of stars aligning for us to manipulate. Of course I'll tell you we have no affiliation with Bitcoin Average - they provide the best API to be able to tie into and allow us to have a well rounded average.
- This is for legal reasons and common amongst literally every single contest that me or my lawyers have come across.
- Isn't that the same as saying "you have to trust Amazon will manually refund you" or any other online merchant? If we don't see enough entries, we have committed to refunding each and every individual. 
Again, these are great points and I appreciate the feedback. Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:00:42
Love this strategy
Didn't see your entry come through though..
ps - Predictions are in CAD
- Adam (contest organizer)

- Predicting the price of Bitcoin is intimidating enough, let alone the price of futures (which aren't as relevant in Canada as they might be in the USA and which I personally find EXTREMELY scummy). We believe we have chosen a verifiable source in the average that is clear and extremely transparent. It is clearly stated on the ticker page (lilachouse.win/ticker) and gives the most accurate price at the exact second that the contest closes.
- We didn't say it would be a "bitcoin skill based question". It will likely be some type of mathematical equation similar to literally every single contest. 
- We haven't seen 1 single entry come in paid with Bitcoin. The intent is to leave all funds in our bank and PayPal (bitcoin/crypto payments will be converted at time of purchase). And yes, we are serious about getting refunds out ASAP.
Again, thanks for the questions, it seems like they are pessimistically bias but it is best to be careful and I definitely get that. I think there is obviously an element of trust (which is partially why the barrier to entry is so low) but I don't think you can argue the fact that we have gone to great lengths (spending time and money) to make this contest as legitimate as possible.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:59:59
We are committed to giving refunds if the contest doesn't follow through. We are confident it will though.

I mean the house comes with $15,000 + the house. You could sell the house for multiple bitcoin.
