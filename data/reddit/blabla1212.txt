Lol get back to me when you will be 16, then I will consider looking up your app, grandpa

Yeah no folding marks on the paper, stright and clean. You didnt find it in the 'letterbox'.

Goverments  tax you with fiat. That alone gives it value because you must have it for taxes and other goverment services. Thats a hard demand for the currency that would never be gone (different than investors demand that just flocks to the most profitable trends which is bitcoin currently) .the only constant demand for bitcoin is by ransomware hackers and even that will move on to monero eventually.  Bitcoin has absolutly zero value propagating mechanism,  zip, it is a mere pyramid scheme just like gold is

Market cap means jack shit. Even if bitcoin markets are just selling/buying 0.0001% of bitcoin value each day, it is their closing prices who determine the value of bitcoins.

Save the bullshit for naive idiots

Bitcoin price does not depend on the value being transferred, just the latest transfer prices.

Without miners it will take a week to process a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:34:42
They have the power. If all miners moved to BTH tomorrow a transaction on bitcoin will take a month to complete and good luck with that. They are the oxygen for the body.

You seem more knowledgeable than the average user here. Ask yourself, what is really the competitive advantage bitcoin has over gold (mobility, maybe safety) and understand it has nothing profoundly different. Both have no real reason for the demand and both are doomed to fail as soon as the world stabilized in future (and even more so after it consolidate under one government in the far far future). One unified Fiat will rule the world in the long term. These banks you mentioned are looking into blockchain from technological prospective only. It is the decentralized concept of the blockchain technology they are after. they just want to use it to reduce load from their servers, and also it helps them seem up-to-date to the average clueless investor.

They dont have to sell their coins in order for their coins to be worth less
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:38:59
big if true
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:11:34
Lol no
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:45:02
Faith build demand, but faith is there as a results of other's demand, its a spiral cycle that can go upwards but also downwards

Stock ramping was a huge problem in stock exchanges that could only be contained when they dimed it illegal with the anti-manipulation rules of the securities exchange act of 1934.

Gold is a pyramid too. (its value is not backed by any sovereign) Gold hast collapsed yet, but it inevitably will

Furthermore, the buy fees, withdrawal fees, and the trading fees must be taken into account. Even if he got out at the same price he got in he would still be roughly 10% down.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:35:30
Im just saying, the data presented here suggest otherwise
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:03:44
you could have sold at 4400, and buy again at 3400. but you are holding 
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:01:41
If that was the case we would have seen a google search rate going up at big bitcoin price drops too. Which is not the case.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:48:16
It can reach 100K and still be a scam. thats how pyramid schemes works
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:13:00
yes, what do you think ?
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:54:30
Yeah and if hypotheticaly the coins were down to 0, would you be ok with recieving nothing?  In most cases the assets of a bankrupt company depriciate after collapse, the law is there to protect you, so you will get the worth at the time of the collapse. Nothing less nothing more.  You cant have it both ways. Want to get the actual bitcoin? Change the law then, and we will see how people will handle getting worthless junk instead of their money in most other cases
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:03:44

Nope. When a company raise capital by offering more shares, your absolute stake remain exactly the same, And your relative stake is being deluted. This is being offsetted by the fact that the company you have stake in received extra capital and as a result worth more.      
It is funny to me that you got upvoted for basically pulling stuff out of your ass. Sheep mentality

@_date: 2018-12-09 10:07:18
Haha I love it man. You just own up on it and it just make everyone here so mad as they dont have any leverage against you. Shit just tell them like it is. That you are not that STUPID to dish 3500$ just to protect some anonymous reddit username and get some imaginary karma points and they can all go suck dick lol

Exchange wallets are big but ill need a source to believe they are the biggest. Do you have it or are you just guessing?
@_date: 2018-12-22 12:06:53
He means 32K a *year*, not month (american style). Per month thats about 3K.
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:14:51
Never.
