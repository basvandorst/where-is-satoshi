so you see these are indirect options for calm commodity market
price of bitcoin is not that to say the least
to short bitcoin someone have to buy them first and drop the price by selling them on real delivery exchanges
in order to get indirect profit from bets placed on separate options market
so they treat bitcoiners as animals in the zoo

they only plan to take them to the zoo?
