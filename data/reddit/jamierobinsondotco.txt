I've turned handling even the most aggressive criticism of Bitcoin into a sport.

No - because then:
1) some voters would find their ballot already used, or
2) when they go to check their vote the next day they'll see another vote was cast after theirs and their vote wasn't counted
The election is called off and reset. It wouldn't happen because they'd know they'd be caught.

Thanks! I think ballots would be created the same way they are today, at some central printing facility then sent around the country. If anyone went to vote and noticed it had already been depleted, the gig would be up.

Interesting - nobody would know how I voted unless I told them or showed them my TX. However if paid I could prove to the buyer that I voted the way I should. So an enterprise is setup paying $50 per vote A, and people bring their TX in after the election for payment.
If there was doubt that the TX I present isn't actually mine, just one I found on the chain, I could break this model. Let me think. Thanks.

Are you familiar with Bitcoin's open model? I can track my vote transaction after the Election and makes sure it exists from any computer in the world. As long as the official election total counts match what I count as the total votes on the blockchain, my vote is in there. Bitcoin transactions can't disappear.

Personally, I worry any election not conducted on paper could be flawed. I've already heard too many stories of flawed voting machines not counting votes and the Blockchain does provide a way to ensure your vote was counted.
This provides some insight into the issue I'm focused on as some transition to electronic voting:

X = number of registered voters in the polling station area * 1.05 variance

I'm up for debate I just don't understand what you're getting at. Any foul play would be immediately identifiable. Once elections officials believe there's been a compromise, it's rescheduled to next month. If we really can solve a problem like an election compromise, I'd say that's a success even if it happens over and over.

You provide proof of existence by showing up at the polling station to take control of your ballot paper wallet and place your vote.
Maybe one day this could be cut out too, but I think it will be a transition and at first polling stations would need to remain open.
