Really? This actually happens at my office...other than the "aren't you supposed to be working" bit.

No we wouldn't. I'm just saying BTC is very equivalent to gold in that both only have value due to rarity and because we've said so...and that I don't understand people who think gold is the end all, be all, of currency backing.

Yes, but the amounts that would actually be used for that application are minuscule. If that's all we used gold for on this planet, the price would be orders of magnitude cheaper than it is...along the lines of copper or silicon.

Jewelry doesn't really count since that value is purely based on scarcity. The other two are absolutely legitimate, but as I said in another reply, the amount that would actually be used in those applications is low enough that the price of gold would be orders of magnitude lower than it is; more similar to other rare, but strictly functional materials...uranium, copper, silicon, etc.

With a currency whose total value is only $1.3Bn right now, it's small peanuts compared to what they can do by expending energy elsewhere.

Agreed, and that's the most worrying thing about it.
The amount in circulation doesn't follow a sound inflation logic to me. If you want a currency that "doesn't inflate" then wouldn't you need to keep increasing the circulation all the time, matching demand? That way, a 2L milk always costs *(n)* BTC.

Come the apocalypse, really it's all worthless anyway. Guns, weapons, food, water, gasoline, vehicles, and animals are the currency in that situation.
My only point really is that I'm tired of the argument that gold has some intrinsic value outside of use as a conductive, non-corrosive, fairly inert metal.

With ASIC miners, I no longer accept the "no intrinsic value" argument anymore. We've got millions of dollars in silicon and steel backing BTC at this point, since those machines are basically useless for any other application.
The thing that bugs me even more, is what intrinsic value does gold have anyway? Rarity is all it's got (e: aside from applications as a conductive, non-corroding, and inert metal). Apocalypse type situation...what are you going to do with it exactly? BTC has rarity and scarcity going for it too, more so than gold even since it's a fixed/diminishing supply.
