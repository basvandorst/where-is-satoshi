I haven’t quite understood what happens if you close out a channel, where the money was routed via like 5 other channels. Are you shutting them all down or what?

If you use a decent exchange like Bitstamp, you can see the limit orders in place on a graph and the prices at which much coin is available are (and look like) sell walls. Hope that helps.

How can the mods approve dumb crap like this, and simultaneously reject some of my proposals for talking intelligently about the Lightning Network? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:04:33
Well larger blocks are a stupid idea, so you are half right/half stupid :-P
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:16:33
No. It’s impossible. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:08:53
Thank you! So much. That makes tons of sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:07
Excellent question. I’m yet to see a halfway satisfactory answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:50:32
I’m not an expert but I think the exchange would have to be in on the scam. Else you’d be “overpaying“ strangers which is probably not a great idea.

Wow, are there any Teslas where the body work is properly aligned? 
Spoiler: no. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:58:55
Merchant Bank?

I just say that I didn’t buy early enough (or enough) to be a gazillionaire. 
But I feel it’s important to show confidence in the concept by admitting some ownership.

Ok, so if you have to start with an on chain transaction to fund the  multisig wallet initially, how does this take any pressure off the base bitcoin layer?
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:18:20
What a nonsense post. TL;DR- centralization is a bad idea, I know, but let’s do it anyway, amirite?!?
OP has forgotten what the actual value proposition of BitCoin is. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:11:16
BitStamp is pretty great. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:10
Thx, sounds cool. But in my head I’m not seeing how that plays out. 
Do I have to choose initially how much to commit to the channel?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:34:10
What BS. CURRENTLY what a on earth would you use any of these crypto currencies for?!?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:30:28
I don’t think you need a fork for this. The system can accommodate more finely cut coins. Just needs to be pushed to the network, as I understand it. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:17:02
So, what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:51:31
Yeah, I guess something like this is inevitable, once some sort of ‘exchange stability’ relative to Fiat becomes obvious.

Was trying to set one up, had an issue with it not working and the online instructions did not line up with website design. 
Reached out to them and ‘Nico’ from support told me “I’m really sorry to inform you that Coinbase no longer support Multisig vaults”. 
It’s extra concerning that their website design and instructions are out of of sync with each other.

Good point, so you think Bit will be the primary term that ends up being used? I can see that.
If the dollar value of a BitCoin 10Xes from here then by your math 2 of today’s bucks becomes 50 bits.
On an unrelated note, what are your thoughts about mushrooms?
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:12:32
Yes, Zir, I did ! My bad.
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:12:06
Jokes aside, I think the clumsy nature of expressing value in BitCoin is a real weakness for spreading adoption. 
This problem is obviously complicated by the currency’s volatility.
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:23:36
That name is far too corny.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:03:49
It may have been legit, but they have just discontinued them, despite saying otherwise on some of their support pages.
Feels pretty amateurish.
Edit: typo, changed I to It
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:54:47
To the moon! �� �� 
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:32:03
In this vein, I find the use of the term Satoshi incredibly corny. I too think that this awkwardness of naming is standing in the way of adoption.
