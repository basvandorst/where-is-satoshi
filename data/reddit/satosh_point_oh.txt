I expect that coinbase and blockchain.info will take care of this for you. The other two you might have to update for the defaults to be correctly set. 
In all four cases though, the best thing to do would be to know when the community switches to 0.9, to wait and make sure there isn't a fork, and then to start putting the lower transaction fee yourself until the wallet software catches up

blockchain doesnt hold your coins. using the seed and the password you can probably recreate your wallet though.

Usually, the updates mean pretty much nothing for the average bitcoin user. This time though, the fees are reducing by an order of magnitude. So its a big deal.

I think so too... we are at a point right now .. some guy calls it the 'chasm'... its the gap between early adopters and the majority 
there is a good picture of it
We still have to get a whole ton of people on board with this bitcoin thing if it is ever going to be as cool and as important as I think that it should and can be. most of the growth is yet to come

got interested in cryptography and computer science in 2012. Someone sent me the whitepaper here on reddit. saved it to my desktop (i usually keep my desktop clean from any files) because i realized how big of a deal it was
but then my hd crash and i forgot about it LOL. Got into btc next time i heard about it, on reddit again. much later though

I'm reading the release notes right now, I will update this post as I go.
* New in 0.9.0 is the Windows 64-bit version of the client    
* OSX 10.5 / 32-bit no longer supported
* Renamed client to 'Bitcoin Core'
* Transaction malleability-related fixes
* Drop the fee required to relay a transaction to 0.01mBTC per kilobyte (0.00001 BTC)
* New option: -nospendzeroconfchange to never spend unconfirmed change outputs
* Add a new checkpoint at block 279,000
* Consider generated coins mature at 101 instead of 120 blocks
* Increase default -blockmaxsize/prioritysize to 750K/50K
* Add payment request (BIP 0070) support
Lotta stuff. Guess that's why its 0.9.0 and not 0.8.7

I got all my cards out just in time too man. I decided to trade them all for pokemon cards. Don't laugh, you will wish you were me next year. POKEMON CARDS TO THE MOON
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:41:26
you are screwed if you never transferred them back out. also make sure to keep up with the mtgox news. it might fix someday
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:36:45
it happened over the past week or two i don't really remember .. i'm not sure how to get a crisp timeline.. maybe just find the statements that mtgox released (should have dates) and look at the markets as well..
imo all this bullshit started when shrem got arrested and then when the enjoy sochi spam started hitting the market
im pretty fucking sure this was all the work of russian hackers.. probably same group that hit target 
internet is scary yo. gotta watch some ghost in the shell to understand 
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:15:53
powerful transaction malleability attack happened
gox made a fuss
speculators and whales dump coins. some say gox is insolvent. better to be in fiat than in coin if they go bankrupt they say. more coins dumped.
gox releases another statement that says they are 'disappearing' by moving to a virtual office.
more coins dumped. price goes below 100. smart investors buying at this time.
suddenly, it seems like gox is starting to be operational again. sepa tranfers are being completed. some BTC transactions happening from their network.
suddenly people start buying. price shoots up.

Honestly, it sounds like what she needs is a technology that hasn't been invented yet (afaik)
something that deals with value in USD (and BTC fluctuates under the hood), and that is simple to send to.
Im gonna go off the cuff here and just brainstorm:
something similar to one of those pagers at a restaurant.. if she gets paid it will buzz to notify here that someone sent her btc's .. idk maybe?
but its probably easier to do it via phone.. or maybe wearables are the future? 
wouldnt it be awesome if someone invented a technology where as soon as someone sent her BTC, her outfit lit up, or flashed for a second or whatever? that would be awesome
btw she doesnt need to wait for confirms. her wallet should tell her when someone sent her a transaction, and its trustable at that point

When your grandkids are flying their private jets (to the moon of course) funded by that sign, that's when satoshi will peer ever so gently from behind eyes that have been dimmed by age at those jets, and smile.

I'll answer both possible questions because I'm not sure which you are asking.
- The maturation process keeps miners from spending coins that aren't actually theirs yet (due to potential block orphaning). 
- Moved from 120 to 101. Well, the network default always has been 100+1, but was changed in the client to 120. Not really sure about this one to be honest. Maybe it's something the miners always changed anyways.

I wholeheartedly recommend reading as much of the wiki as you can. It will put you ahead of many people. Useful skills for the future.

Treasure hunts are my favorite part of btc. so many possibilities . I wonder if someone hid large amount of btc on the web somewhere, or in a book at their library, etc. Fascinating stuff.

The bitcoin devs. Basically anyone who is good at coding and cares about bitcoin. There is a hierarchy though of course.


The protocol is defined within the client's code. 


The devs collaborate on changes, but the miners/community have to accept those changes. Because we are the ones that install/use it. If we didn't then it wouldn't change anything.


To learn about bitcoin updates its easier to first learn about how version control works , specifically github . Check it out on youtube
