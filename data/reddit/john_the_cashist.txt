So, the goal was to retrieve the SMS card and place it in its proper position to reconstitute the puzzle box. Does that then create any new actual capability for the device? Because if that is all and one wanted to use it to store a private key, one can just break the box and retrieve it; no mechanism in it appears to afford the box the ability to avoid retrieval or destroy the private key if the puzzle was broken into ��‍♂️��‍♂️

To anyone with Ill intentions who didn’t know better and had any indication that the owner held any crypto, this box frankly looks like it cost 5 bucks externally. But  my point is that I’m not understanding how this could be an effective means to secure a physical private key; the concept of the puzzle is interesting, but I hope they actually build something specifically for a private key.

No adoption, huh? Bitcoin has been used to purchase most other cryptos in a billion dollar industry, and you have the gall to scream “no adoption”. You can buy goods at countless online stores and purchase online services with bitcoin. That’s like saying “gold has no adoption because I can’t go buy a pack of gum with it at the grocery store”. This is fucking insane; anyone saying that bitcoin’s adoption as a monetary unit has not progressed significantly since its early days is just flat-out in denial. You know, perhaps you haven’t realized, but a few people can also ruin a fiat currency through poor decisions. Also, if a billionaire wants to spend enough money to sway the price of a stock by dumping it all for nothing, they can fucking do that too, and that’s not illegitimate, they will just likely lose a hefty amount of money doing it. Ver and CSW want to shit on everyone, and lose millions in the process for no reason other than pride? They can do that, you can whine all you want but they can fucking do it.

Interesting question. Standard radio communication travels at the speed of light, but can be very slow at transmitting data, due to the lower frequency of the waves. Higher frequency waves, such as infra-red (1550 nm) lasers, can fit more data in and, as a result, deliver the data faster. How much faster? Well, the radio wave transmission used by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) transmits about 6Mb/sec , while 1550nm laser communication could deliver up to 250Mb/sec. We know it only takes light to travel from Earth to Mars 3mins at their shortest distance when they’re adjacent, but as much as 22.4 mins when the planets are diametrically opposed orbitally. Whether or not this data transmission difference actually helps is something else; I’ll leave that for someone to figure out ��?

True, but the Bolivar has suffered massively from governmental legislative and fiscal steps that, in an attempt to address a deep recession through extreme government intervention, printing of new money and take-overs have resulted in a massive amount of inflation, leading to a devaluing of the currency at home and on the global stage. In contrast, BTC suffered from extreme hype followed by a massive correction and is now reaching a level of fear-induced panic selling that is actually hurting its value. However, the intrinsic features, including rate of mining, coins in circulation, security features, and overall adoption, though weakened, have not suddenly changed.

It's amazing how quickly people forget the 2008 financial crisis, and why it is that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies popped up to begin with. Remember the genesis block, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". History repeats itself, and people may need yet another financial crisis to be reminded why a universal, censorship-resistant currency is so valuable. It's easy to dump crypto and to shun even the oft-criticized BTC when the economy is ramping up; but wait until there is a downturn, suddenly BTC and crypto won't seem too bad a pick against government-issued currencies.

The fact that there is manipulation does not equate with it being the major cause of this large drop in BTC value; it’s preposterous to attribute this large of a drop to a “cartel”; honestly, how intelligent are we here?

Before I say what I’m about to say, let me warn that some serious zealots might suddenly start trolling explosively. 
I actually think BTC/BCH could have solved scalability by adopting a double-chain approach. The BTC core would be the notarizing chain affording security and complete decentralization of mining, while BCH would be a scalable, block size-evolving chain allowing for rapid and cheap transactions. BCH would then be notarized onto BTC core. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:19:24
Fair enough ��
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:36:02
But it wouldn’t be nearly as secure as bitcoin ��. For all of its flaws, nothing even touches BTC’s hash rate. BTC is the notary-public of the future. The OP raises an interesting point, could a global institution or country  come in and adopt bitcoin as its official, sanctioned monetary unit? Absolutely, I think so. Though upon first glance that would run somewhat counter to what bitcoin is about: complete decentralization, the truth is no entity can truly lay claim to BTC. I suppose that if a large enough country or organization wanted significant control, they could attempt to buy all BTC available; which points out one of BTC’s fiat vulnerabilities: very low market cap. Certainly, any well-meaning government that decided to institute bitcoin as its official currency would not have access to the money-printing or inflation-controlling tactics that many use to prop their economies. It could possibly be seen as a commitment to governmental transparency that would be akin to a semi-decentralized government in many ways, or just plain, reckless idiocy ��.

He may be a tool, but he makes excellent points and is very poorly matched by his counterpart, who instead just attempts to muddle things with “it makes sense mathematically but we aren’t gonna talk about that right now”. Roger is definitely abrasive and unnecessarily aggressive in his views, which tend to rely on extreme examples for justifying them, but that and being right, especially when it comes to real-world usability, are not mutually exclusive. I understand why Roger is such a divisive character, when you combine an arrogant, obstinate, and completely inexorable approach tinged with arrogance along with with making valid points, you’re gonna piss people off. But by Satoshi, his arguments are absolutely legitimate. This pie-throwing dispute is comical to witness as the next gen alts are lining up to make a move. Why can’t Bitcoin have a heterogeneous block size that gets notarized onto Bitcoin? This would use a system similar to Komodo. This would allow significant scaling without compromising the core of bitcoin (no pun intended).
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:19:42
Do you have actual objective evidence that the small  Mt. Gox selloff actually caused that dip? And, of course they care about the price, if they didn’t, they would just buy BTC at whatever price they wanted. If they decide to sell just to dump the price, how is another whale not looking to pick them up quick? People love to find one culprit for the selloff, discounting the fact that a) money matters, and b) from the pleb to the whale, there are always competing parties. For every whale ready to dump there is another ready to pick up cheap crypto. The truth is EVERYONE expected the price to collapse, and we are more likely to see a shift in sentiment due to simple market psychology, compounded by news of regulations brought in by the original explosive rally in price and ownership of crypto. The truth is likely that whales TRY to manipulate the market, but to say that’s why the market is crashing is taking a tad bit far ��. Let’s not bring the bogeyman into this yet.

I believe blockchains should have a mechanism that prevents minority hardforks. Instead, anyone who wants to perform their own minority hardfork should take the code and generate their new blockchain denovo; this would prevent the generation of blockchains that feed off the name, work, recognition, and user base  of the original chain and that typically corrode the image and dilute the value of the original chain.
