Whether or not you've ever had a bitcoin talk account is irrelevant. It's a forum devoted to bitcoin where shitloads of scams occur because it's populated by average "bitcoiners".
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:36:01
Because this guy is stealing the money with the intention of (at least sometimes) giving it back when it's reported stolen.
The other 90% of the people trying to steal bitcoins in this way have no intention of ever giving any of it back.
The real life equivalent of what just happened: 
The OP left his life savings in his car with the windows down, in a sack labelled with $$$ signs in a bad neighborhood. BtcRobinhood is one of those guys who wears superhero costumes and patrols this bad neighborhood where stupid people have a habit of leaving their money in unlocked cars, when he sees them doing it he steals the money before other people steal it. If the victim reports it on Reddit or elsewhere BtcRobinhood returns it.
If btcrobinhood hadn't been wondering around the bad neighborhood in his cape and mask then some unknown bad man would have stolen it and this thread would never have had a happy ending.

No one really knows whether he's spent some though, we know the first X number of blocks were mined by only one person, but once others joined in we have no idea who owned what.
Satoshi could have spent thousands and thousands of coins as long as he doesn't touch the first 700,000 or 800,000 (roughly when others joined in) we'll never know which after that point were mined by him or others.

Actually my friends and I have a running joke whenever we repay each other via bank transfer in the UK "Drugs and hookers" or whatever as the reference, never had a problem, but I doubt they're really on the lookout. Never put terrorism, I'll try that one soon.
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:02:40
But what else could he have done? If he hadn't stolen it someone else would have. There are guys out there doing exactly the same thing already, and they would have just gone "Awesome, 35btc" and that'd be the end of it.
I'm guessing he makes some sort of effort to contact people in these intances when it's large amounts, he's said previously that it's nearly all trivial amounts he finds (0.01 and the like)
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:26:17
Yeah looks like hte guy is doing something shady related to bitcoin, if he's used TOR etc he should probably give us more info.
I've had multiple cases from the UK police against me dropped because they're incompetent idiots, but this guy is probably shooting himself in the foot considering he's come here before a solicitor, he's probably already fucked up and blabbed.

1 bit
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:54:58
Nope there is no guarantee someone else would have stolen it. However someone probably would have done, it's been proven again and again that people are trying to bruteforce brainwallets. In all likelihood it would have happened at some point, this guy just happens to be around to return it (sometimes at least)
That makes him better than the guys who are also definitely out there never returning it.

Yeah it's more advanced than the US/UK or Australia (the other 3 countries I have accounts in) I think it's also more advanced than the EU.
i.e transfers are instant, to any bank in the country, and transfers to/from the UK/EU are usually 2 days. Transfers from the UK-EU are usually 24-48 hours, so on a par with a transfer all the way to Thailand. It's pretty ridiculous.
Australia is especially atrocious, bank to bank transfers have taken me 5 days there.

don't educate them about anything, the guy above is an idiot. believe me do not talk to the police. don't try and talk your way out of anything. wait til the CPS have ahd a look at the case, at this point you might still get an NFA letter and your stuff back. don't give them the encryption passwords either, wait til the CPS have weighed in. Odds are the police are clueless and hoping you'll educate them (incriminate yourself)

There was never a ban, it was a misunderstanding. They said you can't act as an exchange without a licence, just like with any other currency. Idiots in journalism took that to mean a ban.
They were never banned, I also can't exchange dollars into baht professionally without a licence, dollars aren't banned though.

Just to add, sometimes when people call you they don't hang up, so when you hang up then pick up the phone you're still connected to them. They let you dial the number then answer as the bank. So if you hang up after talking to your bank MAKE SURE you get a dial tone before you redial.
@_date: 2014-07-25 03:47:38
Especially in Thailand, they place a lot of emphasis on face. If I go to a meeting even with a local official I will make an effort to look smart and like I am worthy of their attention. This guy looks like a backpacker.

bittylicious, I use it all the time. Sometimes its 5% or so over spot, but other times it's bang on the money. Either way it's ridiculously fast and reliable and even when I've completely screwed up by sending the wrong vendor money they've sorted it out within 2 hours.

Step 1, withdraw 65 btc worth of canadian dollars from the bank
step 2, find someone on LBC
step 3, buy 65 bitcoins.
Why is this even funny? I have bought a lot of bitcoins in Canada, the USA, UK, Thailand and Australia. It's not rocket science anywhere.
Although Canada and the USA are lagging behind other places due to their slow banking systems

This is exactly my thoughts, let them try and control it. The more government tries to control things like this the more decentralised it becomes.
As for whether or not this will affect me, no, it won't. It won't affect me ( a non NY resident) at all, nor will it affect anyone else. Overseas companies will put a disclaimer stating they won't/can't do business with New Yorkers and New Yorkers will simply pretend they're resident of another state. 
With the exception of a few companies like coinbase this shit is irrelevant

Presumably pretty much any non trivial amount gets posted about somewhere like Reddit or Bitcointalk. I imagine he's built up a stash of 0.1s and so on that he's robbed and no one has ever mentioned online.
I would like to think he googles the addresses a week or so later whenever he steals a non-trivial amount to see if anyone is posting in a panic about it, and then returns it.
I don't know however, hence why I put the (at least sometimes) in my above comment.

Thats been debunked too. Chinese volume is made up of bots because they have zero fees on many exchanges, have you seen the hoops you have to jump through to buy bitcoins in China? Even the Chinese exchanges admit their volume is largely meaningless.
