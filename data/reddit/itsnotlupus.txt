I love that all the bid except one so far are missing an OP_RETURN code with a contact address. They're literally giving them money for nothing.
Not that adding an OP_RETURN would meaningfully improve their odds, but at least they could tell themselves they totally just bid on a real auction for real.
*edit: And it occurs to me that the contact information of the people bidding on this auction is rather valuable. I expect whoever manages to bid correctly will be contacted shortly after with fantastic offers that are just too good to pass up.

True, but if they're going to be jerks about it, they could also just take the bitcoin and run regardless of whoever ostensibly won the auction.
Their reputation on the WoT would take a hit, but they'd probably still be okay.

The fees will probably never be that high, because people simply use bitcoin less as fees rise.

that's fun. that list of accounts would yield itself well to some bit of horizontal cracking (very few passwords -&gt; many accounts), from which OP could easily pick one, edit a new address in, and send themselves the coin.
it's all rather pointless, except for the attention seeking value. The coins aren't from the bitfinex hack, some of them already went through what looks like a mixer service, and the resulting balance is essentially just as tainted as when this charade started.

Weird post. Half-baked thoughts.
It's possible that the mempool is being spammed with low-cost transactions. Once the blocks are full, there appears an incentive for miners to slowly fill the mempool with those transactions, which forces users to bid higher fees to have a chance to get included, as long as the profits generated by those higher fees is higher than the cost of those low-cost transaction fees.
Notably, this opportunity to game bitcoin would not exist if blocks weren't full.


If miners were not sending out their spam transactions, they wouldn't appear in the mempool charts.  
Filling a block with self-made transactions is equivalent to mining an empty block, or a partially-filled block, both of which occasionally occur to this day.  
In contrast, if transactions appear in the mempool, they are very much at risk of being included by any miner should the backlog decrease sufficiently.  
Keep in mind that there's nothing actually forcing miners to ever forget any mempool transaction, and short of another transaction using the same inputs being included in a block, they can be included in a block at any time.  
Any and all so-called "spam" transactions are at risk of being processed at an indeterminate point in the future should it become financially viable for a miner to do so. Any speculation about miners gaming the system in this fashion would need to account for this cost to be credible.

There's a built-in tension between the coins because they both use the exact same mining algorithm, and almost all the mining is done through dedicated hardware, so it means miners with that hardware can only do one of three things: mine BTC, mine BCH, and not mine anything.  
Since one of the two coins is necessarily more profitable to mine than the other at any given point in time, miners that aren't emotionally/ideologically attached to one chain will tend to quickly switch to whatever makes them more money, which can introduce spikes of mining hashrate volatility, causing longer or shorter than expected intervals between mined blocks.
At some point, there was an expectation that this volatility would naturally converge toward the death by mining starvation of one of the chains, but that doesn't seem to be happening.

I'm not entirely sure, but to get started, scan the QR code with your phone, see if it gives you a public address, then look that up to see what kind of money you're playing with here.
Don't share any of that data with anyone, particularly not the seed or long strings of whatever.
Some of that information is either a private key, or something that can be used to derive a private key. depending on the shape, number of words, whatever else, you may need various bitcoin clients to get to that part, and that's something I'm not really too familiar with.  
Links that may or may not be relevant:  
  
Generally, if you had some idea of the client/wallet the seed phrase comes from, you may have an easier time.
Otherwise, if the long string of numbers/letters starts with a "5", it's probably a private key. You'd need to import that in your wallet to be able to use it. If it starts with a "1" or a "3", it's a bitcoin address, the kind you'd put in a URL like  to see its balance and transaction history.

The main selling point is that it's safe to use it on a thoroughly compromised computer (as long as you pay close attention to the transaction data the device asks you to confirm.). 
It's something that's really not available through any other scenario.
Beyond that, the hardware is supposed to be tamper proof, pin protected, auto wipes after a few bad pins, etc., but it's hard for a mere mortal to tell how well that would hold against a sophisticated attacker.  
In practice, I think it means the device should be treated with almost as much reverence as a seed. In particular, I don't know that it would be appropriate to pass a customs checkpoint with one.   
The device allows to configure multiple pins that open different wallets, so you may be tempted to use that as some plausibly deniable wallet while you hand off a different pin to the government official demanding access to your electronic device, but that'll mean the "wipe after X bad pins" policy becomes meaningless since entering the other pin will reset the count, and I would expect a sophisticated attacker to have ways to automate a pin space search.
So, not a panacea, but deserves to be part of your defense in depth strategy to manage your coins.

Fun, and I have no reason to doubt the video, but you should know taking a video of navigating to twitter in a new browser, and loading some page there can still very much be faked, through a number of means.
For example, installing a custom root CA on your local computer and configuring a little intercepting proxy (fiddler does all of that really well) to serve custom data in an otherwise normal site would work just fine. Your browser would show a pretty green padlock and everything.
Alternatively, a little greasemonkey/tampermonkey script could tweak a site's behavior in any way it wants, and would allow to fake this kind of result as well.

Well, you have a few possibilities here.
If the math and all the assumptions behind it are right, then an untold numbers of miners are desperately trying to mine bitcoin for a hundred times the price it would cost to just buy the same amount.  
That would imply that every single miner is both technically savvy enough to setup elaborate and sometimes large scale mining operations, yet dumb enough to not realize they could get a lot more bitcoins by simply buying them outright.
If that seems unlikely to you, then odds are good that [this quora answer isn't very good.](
Instead, what's much more likely to be true is that mining bitcoin costs on average slightly less than buying bitcoin outright, and the difference between the two is the profit that miners get for their work.

I'm not entirely sure. 1 million is less than 100 btc nowadays. You may be able to use a plain exchange without really moving the price much. If that's a concern, something like Gemini auctions may be useful.

As far as withdrawal limits, Coinbase is somehow much stricter than Gemini. But one of my concerns is what happens when your checking account suddenly received a million dollar wire transfer. Does your bank carry on as if nothing, or do they freak out, freeze your account and demand a detailed explanation as to the source of funds? Does it mean you can't pay your bills anymore until your bank calms down, however long that takes?
All things you'll want to look up and resolve before you pull the trigger.

you don't need to split bitcoin cash from bitcoin, their transaction formats are mutually incompatible, so transacting on one won't result in any unexpected surprise on the other.

I'm not sure. Anyone that claims to have a complete understanding of the consequences to come is either an amazing expert or a fool, and will usually believe themselves to be the former.
I have some concerns that it will eliminate no just "spam" transactions, but also micro-transactions. Higher fees would probably correlate with higher value per transaction, pushing ordinary uses of bitcoin out of scope. For example, I wouldn't be able to buy my Humble Bundles with bitcoin anymore, unless I paid more to the miners than to the EFF. Ultimately, this would make bitcoin less useful to most people, and promote the growth of alternatives, of which there are many, at worst relegating Bitcoin to some role of interbank settlement network nobody cares about except for a few finance nerds. It's likely that even the most stubborn people in charge would change course (or, as Glorious Leaders often do, continue the course toward success, by doing what they had meant to do all along) before it ever got this bad, but perhaps not before some persistent damage to the ecosystem is done.
With all that said, the blocksize issue is minor compared to the issue of who controls Bitcoin. It's not actually as simple as getting rid of Core. It's a necessary prerequisite, but it's really not trivial to think through a working alternative that doesn't tend to converge back into a centralized point of inevitable failure.

I've read this argument half a dozen times about this tweet alone.
Did I stumble into a parallel universe where the price of bitcoin is closely correlated to news items, and therefore the value of any given news item can be strictly inferred from the immediate price action?
In the universe I came from, there have been long running jokes for a couple of years about news items having at best no impact on the price, and often enough have a seemingly opposite effect on price than what popular wisdom would have expected.
So... parallel universe, or nonsensical overreach on your part?

You might have caught a mention of time-locked operations in the presentation, which is something the lightning network proposal heavily depends on, which is one proposed approach to scaling things.
It's a relatively tiny step toward scaling, but an experimental sidechain against testnet implementing operations needed for lightning.network to have any chance to exist is still a step.
More generally, this seems like a way to fight against bitcoin's sclerosis. We know we can increase the block size, but it doesn't change bitcoin's scaling characteristics, it just kicks the can down the road. Maybe that's literally the best that can be done. But maybe not, and maybe that's the option being pushed because it's the least risky.  
Sidechains seem like a good way to explore risky, even reckless shit. In the very worst case, your sidechain goes down in flame, but bitcoin keeps going.   
Even better, you don't have to convince anybody to start a sidechain. You just go off and make things happen.  
And so maybe that increases the odds that someone, somewhere can develop an approach that doesn't just throws more resources at bitcoin, but actually changes the way it scales altogether. And not just develop it, but try it out, and prove to everyone else whether it works.
I'm guessing the blockstream people don't want to draw a straight line from their stuff to bitcoin scalability, because it's not a straight line. All this stuff just opens possibilities.

That's a great question, and one that you should look into. Miners can indeed decide to stop mining at any time, and some do just that every day. Usually, that's because they're not able to make a profit anymore. Miners aren't altruistic folks selflessly wasting millions on computers for the greater good. Bitcoin is designed to give them an incentive to do this, because they make a profit for doing so. That's what stops them in the end: For any miner that gives up, another is more than willing to take their place.


What system are you talking about? Bitcoin itself only supports a very specialized programming language, that is enough to make transactions and some specific flavors of smart contracts, but entirely inadequate to write something as neat as a virus.
However, end users that run windows and click on any "download" button they see, then decide to give bitcoin a go, can indeed be at risk of getting their stuff stolen.  
Securing your own systems is hard, and if you're going to hold your own bitcoin, it's probably a good idea to invest a few bucks in a hardware wallet that will mitigate virtually every online attack vector.
Generally, you're asking the right questions here, except you're immediately following them with incorrect assertions.

That's my sense as well. The consolidation of power with Bitcoin extends well beyond the miners.  
I'm hoping the current shit show will eventually end up having some positive impact as far as community and development processes go. But the miner situation is something else.  
I suspect it'll require bitcoin users to realize they have more power than the miners, and then doing something borderline stupid in large enough numbers, with the support of one or more of the dev groups hopefully formed at that point.  
Or maybe there's a gentler way to do this where our beloved miners don't end up with a large pile of worthless ASIC. Who knows.

The "war" (which I take to mean the censorship, DDOS, consensus by exclusion, misleading experts calling hard forks "altcoins", and folks complaining about it all) is not about blocksize.
It's about control. Centralized control of bitcoin.
Control of the message, even as it destroys the medium.
Control of the codebase, even as it cripples the network.  
Control in the hands of a few, under the pretense that only they are smart enough to know what's best for everyone else.
The blocksize is not the issue.  
When the Core benevolently decides to raise the blocksize to some arbitrary number, it will not solve the issue.
While the Core stands at the center of Bitcoin, there is no decentralization.

That'd imply some short term capital gains taxed as income with a mix of federal and state taxes to get to that number.
With long term capital gains, the max rate is 20% plus a net investment income tax of 3.8%. Then the highest state tax for long term cap gains is California, at 13.3%. All together, you end up at a worst possible tax rate of 37.1%.

The flip side of that is that handling your own private bitcoin wallet is not risk-free either, and that risk is roughly proportional to how little tech literacy you have.  
So, you have to pick between 3d party risk (your exchange fucking up) and 1st party risk (you fucking up). For all of us techies, we'll obviously prefer to manage our wallets ourselves, but it's perhaps not as clear a decision otherwise.
If you're willing to read up on computer security, what have been the various attack vectors against bitcoin wallets, and how hardware wallets help to mitigate most of them (and how they can still be subverted if you let them), you'll be able to make better decisions about this.

It is worth noticing that this certainty comes from the bitcoin clients trusting the [Certificate Authorities]( to tell end users that the bitcoins are going to go to the right address.  
Whereas every aspect of the bitcoin protocol was designed to be decentralized and trust-less, this new feature undermines that before the protocol itself ever comes in play.
This is a sharp philosophical departure from the guiding principles that underlie bitcoin, one that I wish had triggered a bit more of a discussion before this became a fait accompli.
Oh well. let's pretend we're having a discussion about it anyhow.


That's mostly true, and it's not a good situation. But bitcoin was never meant to enshrine a crappy status-quo. We know how to implement a decentralized X509 trust model, using a blockchain of all things. See [Namecoin's TLS support]( as a proof of concept if nothing else.  
Something like this could enable user-friendly names to be matched securely with X509 certificates, without compromising the decentralized nature of bitcoin.


It could be worse, but it's not insignificant. We went from having absolutely no trust and nothing central to having a central step injected into a flow end-users will commonly use to send bitcoins around. Why? Because it's easier, and more user-friendly.  
Why then are we dealing with the threat of 51% attacks, with the risk of double spending, and with a large blockchain size when it would be so much easier to have a few central servers we simply trust to do the right thing?  
As this goes unchallenged, and it certainly looks like it has, we have our first central trust trojan horse in the bitcoin codebase.  
For every new feature thereafter, there'll be a tension of "Do we *really* need to have this be decentralized? It's a lot easier to implement the other way. Look, we did it for our Trusted Friendly Bitcoin Address^tm and it worked out great, didn't it?"  
It's not just this particular feature. It's the overall development direction for bitcoin. If this is okay, what else is?

I'm not going to guess why, except to note that it mirrors the gender patterns we see in much of the IT / tech sphere, and that any elements that can help understand the tech gender gap situation would most likely apply here as well.
However, unlike other parts of the tech world where there's a higher barrier to entry which tends to minimize the most obvious sexism (If I had to speculate, I'd guess that sexism is partially soluble in higher education), bitcoin is much more accessible to all, and as such the high male/female ratio translates into some really weird shit.
A recent example of that would be almost every comments on [Hi Everyone, newbie girl here, got paid in BTC by a photographer so I had to register here :)](  
Perversely, that thread has significantly more upvotes and participation that similar non-gendered (ie with an implicitly male OP) threads, where folks are typically told to try their luck on or some-such.  
Yet look at the comments. Then imagine OP was male instead of female, and go back to the comments and count how many of them still make any sense.  
For every helpful comment, there are literally 5 calling her an attention whore, accusing her of manipulating the community with her female attributes, and suggesting that she visit I would not blame OP if she decided to never visit here again.  
At the least, she might reconsider her careless decision to not hide her gender, as I suspect many women are doing in here.

Look back further in the past. You'll see one or two more bumps that present some similarities with those last two.
I wouldn't expect an expect copy of those shapes to reoccur, so I'd be careful about predicting the length of the lull between booms.
is correct in that the scenario is not the same, but it was different on each previous boom too, and it's not completely obvious to me why booms happened (and ended) when they did based on news alone.
If I had to speculate wildly, I'd venture that those cycles occur because:  
- we have a solid base of die hard believers which prevents the price from crashing after a boom end. This is what we're seeing now. No matter how many horrible news are dumped on us, the die hards are sticking it out and buying "cheap" coins as necessary.  
- we have a regular stream of media attention showered at bitcoin, attracting people that *would* jump into bitcoin if they felt a bit more sure that it wasn't going to crash to zero soon. Those people accumulate on the sidelines, waiting for a sign.  
- when enough people are waiting on the sidelines, all it takes is a relatively small price bump caused by whatever good news of the week to ignite things and cause them to jump in, causing the next feeding frenzy.
Based on the above groundless speculation, the lull will last roughly as long as it takes to acquire a critical mass of new would-be bitcoiners, which probably has more to do with media coverage than historical stock price shapes.

Pointing out a problem seems better than not. 
Asking me to get off my soapbox is encouraging me to be silent until I can somehow produce an alternative implementation that doesn't have this issue, which is non trivial.
The short term patch would be to undo the friendly name feature altogether. It would be painful yet give the necessary impetus to redesign the feature correctly. Yet I imagine that submitting a pull request to do that without any discussion beforehand would not go well.
FWIW, I don't really think Bitpay is to blame for this. the BIP was designed and implemented by the bitcoin core devs, and it's now there for anybody to build upon, including Bitpay.
And so I am on my tiny soapbox because I don't believe the feature will be undone. The feedback I've gotten, both here and on IRC, is that this is a non-issue, a pragmatic choice, etc.

Well.. This whole "economists talk about bitcoin" thing is mostly about using the  predictive powers of macro economics to peer into the future and forecast bitcoin's ultimate (and apparently gloomy) fate.
Given that those predictive powers have a rather spotty track record when applied to well known events, like predicting a recession, I can imagine there's a bit of a gap in this particular branch of science, leaving some room for ideologies to sneak in.  
On the other hand, bitcoin as an ecosystem is a lot simpler than a whole freaking country, so maybe this is the ideal playground to model everything correctly and come up with a perfect forecast, no ideology required.  
I've yet to see any such analysis, perhaps in part because the intersection of people that truly understand bitcoin, have a good visibility into its ecosystem and a great understanding of economics is so darn small.
So in the absence of that, what exactly is yet another article by a distinguished economist dismissing (or who knows, lauding) bitcoin in 3 beautifully written paragraphs?  
Science or ideology?

Think of ripple as a potentially decentralized exchange, where XRPs are only useful to grease the exchange, and most participants need very little XRPs to do what they want.
I say "potentially decentralized" because the system is apparently designed to be decentralized, despite the current situation where every consensus server (think mining server, sort of) is controlled by Ripple Labs.  
They claim this is temporary and done to allow for development to proceed efficiently, the implication being that Ripple is not meant for general use yet.
The "exchange" bit is perhaps something most folks are missing about Ripple. At the core of the protocol is a mechanism to place and resolve trades between various currency IOUs, which can be converted into the underlying assets at gateways that issue those IOUs.
I'd still argue it's not a competitor to bitcoin, but not for the same reasons.

- Manning, Snowden and Assange had a taste of the protections afforded to actual whisteblowers. They are treated like criminals first and foremost and only a small afterthought, if any, is given to what their intents and end results were.

This is actually good news for Ripple!
Alright, let me try to spin this as a positive. Stay with me.
See, XRPs are used for two purposes: To grease up various operations with tiny fees, and to fund Ripple Labs.
In a healthy Ripple network, the amount of non-XRP items held and traded should dwarf the amount of XRP by orders of magnitude. By that metric, the Ripple network just became  a bit healthier.
In concrete terms, it means it's going to be cheaper to open a Ripple account, to trade items, to extend trust, etc.
Meanwhile, none of the non-XRP items on Ripple are losing value, as their pricing is essentially unrelated to XRP's.
The other half, funding Ripple Labs, is a bit more ambivalent. Some could argue Jed made this move to retaliate financially against Ripple Labs after a not-entirely-amicable parting of ways.
It's unclear how much Ripple needs Ripple Labs to survive. There's a useful core feature set that's already built and working. The entire codebase is open-sourced under a permissive license.  
Ripple Labs however is possibly the only thing standing between us and Ripple become a truly decentralized network.
So if RL had to close doors down the line, Ripple the codebase would lose a number of full-time developers, at least initially, but Ripple the network could gain its wings, and start to fly on its own.
(That assumes that it is possible for ordinary folks to run fully working consensus servers on their ADSL links that can sync with other home servers faster than ripple ledgers are generated, that there is an acceptable mechanism for ripple users to find a set of consensus servers to connect to, that the consensus protocol in an environment where not all participants are well-meaning actually works as intended, and a few other things. )

Past that, some kind of keylogger is the most likely culprit. It's interesting that it's not showing up easily on a malware scan though.  
Not because it means there isn't malware, but because it hints that you could have been targeted by lovingly hand-crafted malware. Which means this may not have been a mass-automated drive-by kind of a thing, but something more specific.

The sticky point there is the transmission of the OTP between parties.
Some side-channel has to be used, and snooping on that channel makes it then trivial to snoop on the main data.

Almost. 
Using plain sha2 for password hashing has become a bad idea thanks to the existence of dedicated ASIC hardware that exist only to compute sha2 hashes as fast as possible.
I'd suggest using scrypt instead with default parameters or stronger. It will protect your users a bit better in case of a database compromise.

Well let's see.. 
- The headline is wonderfully misleading at many levels, not the least of which that this is  in no way a story about a self-made man using bitcoin to move upward. The "how'd they do it" answer has a lot more to do with being born in wealth and privilege than throwing some play money into a little bitcoin venture fund.
- I see criticism for his part in the CoInvalidation bullshit, and for the hilarious apparent lack of self-awareness shown in the article and its pictures.

Except of course that's a woefully incomplete description of bitcoin and namecoin, where the true differentiating keywords are "Trustless" and "Decentralized."
If the goal was merely to have a global distributed high performance network, then we'd just roll our Centraliom system on a bunch of servers, tell folks "Trust us, we'll keep track of your balance/identity/whatever", and life would be much simpler.
That's missing the point though, and unfortunately, that's exactly what bitiom appears to be doing.

It probably boils down to intent.
If I have a private key, give it to you, and we both use the key happily to deposite and/or withdraw, yes, it's a lot like a joint account.
If I have a private key, and you "bump into" my private key, see a balance there and take it for yourself, the transactions in the blockchain are essentially identical, but the intent of both parties is completely different.
It gets a bit funkier if you had the private key first, and I, naive brainwallet user, generate it from my super secure "correct horse battery staple" password and proceed to start using it under the assumption that it's my private wallet.
I imagine it'd make a difference if you are also a naive brainwallet user who doesn't quite grok xkcd (no malicious intent), vs someone who happened to farm a few million brainwallets hooked to a blockchain-watching bot.  
The first case is akin to two blindfolded folks trying to hit a pinata and hitting each others instead. Unfortunate, but probably not assault.  
The latter has a clear intent to find other people's balance and re-appropriate them, so more likely to be actionable legally.
(IANAL, so everything here is probably wrong. oh well.)

That's how we apparently know for a fact that DPR wants to kill people a lot, almost as much as Schrem launders money.

That's a tiny step up from basic auth, but not great for various reasons:
- the UI to type the password isn't customizable. you get some ugly browser popup dialog shown to users.  
- the password hash gets sent over and over again on every request. That increases the odds of something going wrong compared to a single login request.  
- plain md5 hashing is completely insufficient to protect passwords, be it in transit or in storage. As such, it should never be used over a plain-text http connection.

Sure, and to diminish the impact further, it took nowhere near 12 billion dollars to get to our current market cap, and I don't believe it would even take that to get to a 1 trillion market cap.
There's the pure market price aspect of it, but I think there also has to be some correlation to the utility of bitcoin, even if it's only speculative utility. That's where I expect a disruption to happen first, before it gets reflected in a market price. If none happen, I'm not convinced the price will just keep shooting upward forever.
On the plus side, as it keeps rising now, it's looking more threatening to a certain segment, and it's possible one of them will try something violent to counter it, which might just be a catalyst for actual disruption down the line.

FWIW, it's rarely a good idea to have a forum post that asks many internet dwellers to go to wikipedia to correct a perceived slight.
Wikipedians tend to perceive it as [Canvassing]( and to be extra-critical of whatever contributions come from it.
That said, if you're in the business of doing things right, you're going to need sources. Good sources.

Your mission, if you accept it, is to find trusted sources (alas, reddit does not qualify) that claim that bitcoin is totally definitely a currency. Once you do, you can add that source to the pile at the bottom, and add a blurb in that section to use it. The more sources you find, the more you can push back in the article text on whether bitcoin is a currency.

It's obvious coinbase users are not comfortable with large lists of their emails and full name being passed around.
That coinbase's new Director of Security doesn't see the enumeration of accounts of a financial system as problematic in any way is not a good sign.
That said, once they get a clue, the ways to fix this are:
- only disclose the name associated with an account from an action initiated by the owner of that account.  
- outwardly treat requests for money identically for emails associated with a coinbase account and emails that are not associated with a coinbase account.  
In addition, some sane limits on how many emails a given coinbase user gets to spam would probably make sense.
None of this is terribly hard to do.

Hi. 
So, you intrigue me. You seem to be smart, knowledgeable in economics (presumably, since I know nothing of the beast myself), you have a bit of a bad attitude, you consistently write things that make bitcoin true believers sad, and you've been posting a great number of comments, all of them in since you created this account about 2 weeks ago.
As to me, I'm almost your polar opposite. I'm guessing you're here because you're intrigued by some aspect of bitcoin. I don't know that I can help you with that, but I suspect you could help me. 
There are a number of arguments that keep coming up against bitcoin's viability, that tend to leave some aspects unsaid, presumably because it's too obvious to them. My best attempts to engage them have resulted in, paraphrasing the replies loosely, "lol go read a macroecon textbook n00b", much to my disarray.
So while there is a distinct possibility that I may be an economics idiot (an Idiot of Economics? No, that does sound right either) here, you spend quite a lot of time around these parts, and if the tone of your comments is any indication, you're finding quite a few idiots by yourself already, so what's one more..
Would it be okay for me to pick your brain? I'd like to understand better what those arguments are exactly. I cannot guarantee I will change my mind about bitcoin's potential, for I am indubitably a True Believer, but I don't like having blind spots all the same.
If so, could we start with something about the deflationary properties of bitcoin, or perhaps more accurately the deflationary pressure built into bitcoin by having a predetermined supply? I've seen many variations on that argument, all of them imply bad things for bitcoin. I'm curious to understand exactly what those bad things would be and why.

By this definition, bitcoin has been steadily deflating since its inception, with a few occasional burst of inflations. Is that right?
In your last sentence, you said "The economy isn't working." This is the "bad things" part I alluded to earlier. But what does that mean for Bitcoin exactly? We've defined deflation as coupled to the market value of a bitcoin. Would the "economy not working" result in an eventual loss of market value, and if so, could that negate the very deflation causing the problem in the first place?

If we don't know that the price will always go up, then there is no reason to refuse to spend bitcoins unconditionally, as OP suggests should be the case.
I think the key aspect I'd like to convey is that we're not dealing in absolutes here. We're simply not in a situation where it makes zero sense to buy things with bitcoin.  
The deflationary pressure on bitcoin may be hurting the amount of transactions that could otherwise be happening, but some of the very same interest in bitcoin that is causing that market pressure in the first place is likely also fueling an interest in using bitcoin for purchases.  
You're apparently not in that category, using bitcoin purely to make a buck. You are either relying on greater fools to eventually hold your bags, or you yourself believe that there exists a market where bitcoin has a utility beyond mere speculation.  
If you're in the first bucket, I pray that your sense of market timing is impeccable. But if you're in the latter, maybe there's more for you to do with bitcoin. No pressure.
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:16:16
Lovely. You said "there's no reason to use Bitcoins as currency" and "Bitcoin provides no additional utility to the user", but maybe you really meant bitcoin (and other current cryptocurrencies) were useful somehow.


No they don't. Again, there's no good reason for a central entity to deploy a distributed blockchain to manage a store of value they want to completely control.  
All the trade-offs made by bitcoin, all the perceived shortcomings, the 51% attack, etc. are all there to enable a distributed legder. If there's no reason for the distributed part, a central ledger is vastly superior in almost every respect.

Simply self-signed would defeat the point here, since the idea is that an end user can trust that the friendly name shown is correct.  
There'd need to be some way to ensure that the friendly name is owned and controlled only by one consistent entity.
The current approach of bitcoin clients is to ask central servers what they think.  
If bitcoin was to remain completely decentralized, it would either implement something similar to what namecoin is doing, or if that's not practical for whatever reason, not implement a friendly name feature until there exists a practical decentralized trust-less way to do so.

Not really, but I've been perusing some of your comments, and I remember you mentioned it happens when the demand for a currency exceeds its supply.
Does it mean the word deflation is only meaningful in the context of bitcoin as a currency, and would not apply to bitcoin as a commodity?
And yes, I answered with what causes it, not what it is. I'm blurry on that part. Wikipedia says "a decrease in the general price level of goods and services."
So that brings up a few thoughts, one of which is that literally nothing is priced in bitcoin as of now. That could change later if volatility subsides, but what does that say about a deflationary argument against bitcoin?

That's a nice Rube Golberg machine idea, but it's completely unnecessary.
Anti-viruses recognize bad files not being they're able to detect badness, but because they mechanically recognize sequence of bytes that have been extracted from previously known bad files, that are hopefully unique enough to not crop up in good files and trigger a false positive.
So really, all a bad guy has to do is write a new bad file that happens to not use any of those known sequences, and it will be seen as "innocent looking", at least until anti virus folks grab a sequence from it and add it to the pile.
As a corollary, if someone did go through the trouble of writing a Rube Golberg virus, it would go through the exact same process, get sequenced and catalogued to be recognized by future updates of anti-virus databases.

I'd prefer slightly more visual names, that move away from crypto-jargon, and tie to concepts people can somewhat intuitively relate to.
For example:
0\. a wallet fragment. (iconography: puzzle piece, wallet )
7. a hardened wallet fragment (or maybe "blind wallet fragment"?) (iconography: metal, rivets, puzzle piece, wallet)
23.  a fragment forge (short for hardened wallet fragment forge) (iconography: metal, anvil, hammer )
57. a fragment seal (iconography: metal, seal (wax or stamp))
Basically, we start from a concept of wallet, which folks generally grok. Since a wallet is made of private keys, a private key is a wallet fragment. if it's encrypted, it's hardened to prevent someone else from breaking it. if you give an intermediate code to someone else, they can use it to forge hardened fragments on your behalf, and they can add a seal to the result that will show that it's legit.
It's not a perfect metaphor, and I'm sure it can be greatly improved upon, but it conveys a number of basic properties to common folks without requiring any rudiments of cryptography.

There are some lessons to be learned from this.
Google's goodwill toward bitcoin notwithstanding, this underscores vividly why using an app platform that can yank your installed apps from under you is not an ideal choice for a bitcoin wallet.
People are perhaps slightly more aware that this can happen with web pages, and hopefully are more inclined to keep offline backups for it.
But it's not quite as intuitive that installed chrome apps can disappear in a way that's much more akin to web pages than traditional installed apps.
So, as I see it:  
- users need to be made aware that installed chrome apps can disappear suddenly, much like a website.  
- app developers need to prepare for that eventuality, possibly by forcefully shoving a wallet backup flow down users' throats when they set the app up. Or using an encrypted cloud storage mechanism and an alternate client that runs on a web page. Something.

So.. do we really hope to get the public at large to embrace concepts of "encrypted private keys" ?
Look at bitcoin addresses. They're derived from public keys, but nobody cares, nobody calls them "public key derivations", because instead of using a term that describes their inner structure, we use one that describes their use: addresses you can send bitcoin to.
So following in that direction, it would make sense to use terms for private keys and codes that actually reflect what they are used for.
As a bonus, it's possible that one would be able to match icons to those friendly terms that aren't all variations of a key.

Who said anything about destroying bitcoin?
Pay them to deny transactions from a list of blacklisted addresses.  
You don't even have to get 50% right away, just start paying whoever will take it.
Start with a rather small list of addresses in your blacklist.  
Structure your pay-off with a flat per-block fee, along with a bonus for each transaction denied. Soon enough, they'll be asking you themselves for a bigger list of addresses.  
Once the rest of the pools see that, they can either stick to their guns for the principle and offer lower returns (and lose their miners), or they can join in, get paid, and consolidate the strength of the blacklist.
Now we just need to figure the budget needed to do that. It's a lot lower than the budget needed to buy enough hardware to pull a naive 51% attack.

Your notion that current cryptocurrencies are fundamentally useless, except for early adopters that benefit from the gain in value is essentially just shy of calling bitcoin a pyramid scheme.  
It's a common opinion, I suppose.
The idea that Western Union or Home Depot would start deploying a distributed blockchain of their own is extremely far fetched.  
Central entities have no reason to create/use their own distributed cryptocurrency. There's nothing that cryptocoins do that can't be done better and more efficiently by a bunch of central servers, as long as you're okay with having central servers.

Mad speculation here, but it's likely not going be as trustless as bitcoin.
You can largely avoid the whole race-to-ASIC thing by equipping every Thing with a little certificate, and requiring a valid cert to take part in a blockchain validation process that isn't CPU-bound, but perhaps more ripple-ish in nature.
With it, you would end up with a few millions well-behaved Things that play ball, and it becomes difficult for an attacker to dissect enough Things to extract their certs and reuse them in an altered variant of the protocol that'd push the blockchain in an unexpected direction.
Until the cert signing authority fucks up, of course.
Still, the benefits of that approach over just keeping the ledger centralized on a few IBM servers are not entirely obvious. Maybe some ability for Things to interact in the absence of a wide-area network link?

Well, the question here would be: Can someone come up with a system that results in a more fair distribution early in the system's life, that can reach a significant level of voluntary adoption?
I've seen a number of alt-coins and ripple IOUs that ostensibly have that goal.
Freicoin for example penalizes long term holders by shrinking their holdings over time. It doesn't seem to be terribly popular.
There have also been some weak attempts to have some ripple IOUs issued by perhaps well meaning folks to whoever submits a proof of identification, the idea being that 7 billion emails later, everyone on earth would have been given the same amount of stuff, therefore being super fair.  
Is that what needs to succeed where bitcoin must fail? Or do you have something else in mind?

Well.. I layer my sarcasm a bit too much maybe. Allow me to unwrap the outer layer.
Parallel construction is a [documented technique practiced by US governmental agencies]( where government agents will literally write a work of fiction into an official court document to avoid having to reveal how the investigation actually happened.  
Ostensibly, this is done to protect the very secret methods available to the NSA, although it would certainly be a great way to hide that some evidence presented should in fact be inadmissible due to the way it was obtained. (Any parallels with the current story is probably just a sad coincidence.)
In contrast, a retroactive warrant, if such a curious beast existed, would be a work of fiction with a falsified date written by a court official to hide that some evidence should be inadmissible. So, completely different thing, and despite parallel construction being a proven practice, one should refrain from inferring that similar practices occur.
The story you linked notes that the prosecutor argues that a warrant was unnecessary to break into the servers.  
If a judge somehow disagrees with this cavalier view on warrantless search and seizures, the prosecutor would find himself in need of a warrant. Fortunately, as he was careful not to admit he had no such warrant, the sudden appearance of such a document would certainly help his case.  
The likely present lack of existence of such a warrant would ordinarily be a hard obstacle to overcome but, as parallel constructions have shown, truth doesn't always need to get in the way of justice.

In both cases, whether by spending bitcoins you do have, or refusing to buy more/any bitcoins, you are missing on a fantastic business opportunity.

I think that's just the Ethereum folks trying to be modest. Its feature set is a strict superset of bitcoin. You're right that there hasn't been much push to build a retail ecosystem. But if the smart contract thing takes off, one would expect that to change at some point.


If I had a bit for every time I've read this in &gt; it is more dependent on Trust than any other currency on Earth today.
I think I agree. I'm fond of Gibson's term "consensual hallucination" to describe abstract concepts brought to life by cultural developments. The whole concept of consensus makes it fit particularly well with cryptocurrencies, and the hallucination part is a good reminder that this only works because people thinks it works.


And that's where you lose me. Bitcoin's code was forked many times, into many more than 42 million coins, and the public somehow managed to know and care enough to not be confused.  
Maybe you should investigate how many people are confused about Ethereum's money supply, and are belaboring under the false impression that it currently has 177339207 ETH rather than merely 88,689,867. 
I suspect that number is vanishingly small, but if you were to find credible evidence of the contrary, then there would indeed be ground to worry about a hard fork's effect on bitcoin's perceived money supply.

well.. mouse over the "." at the end of "freedom today." to see what I was trying to do. By hiding the in there, the idea was to make it look like an old and busted comment, yet have process it as if nothing.
But that failed for two reasons. First, either your bot was way overloaded, or it didn't trigger from a link comment (or more likely, it was triggered, but did its own parsing of the comment and decided it wasn't actionable.)  
Second, will override the receiver from the parent commenter to any /u/ name found in the comment. (although arguably that could be worked around with some strategy zero-width unicode whitespace characters or somesuch.)
It triggered very soon after I edited the comment though, which is either completely coincidental, or happened because I included in the edit. Not sure which.
If the bot was just overloaded, then this sneaky technique would in fact work, provided one is careful to make sure any other present in the comment is broken in some way to avoid changing the tip destination.

Eh.. He and many others have proclaimed the failure of bitcoin many times over. They convinced whoever they could already.  
Those who doubted the accuracy of bitcoin's previous obituaries will not be swayed this time either.


That's certainly reminiscent of ETH vs ETC. Yet Ethereum hasn't crashed, nor does it show any signs of dying. Its technology is still actively developed, the ecosystem around it still being built.  
I'm not sure there's anything so different with Bitcoin that would result in a significantly different outcome.


That's.. interesting. The comparative hashrate is one of the few measures there are to gauge the survival of a fork. It'd be profoundly counter intuitive to mine a fork you don't support. Some ordinary bitcoin miners were mining empty blocks at one point. It wasn't felt at a deathly blow, just a weird quirky thing to do. Again, if we look at ETH vs ETC, we see no evidence of this having taken place, and things were definitely less than friendly in that neighborhood. If they thought it would have hurt the other side, they would have done it.


Joe can fork bitcoind on github and create something else called bitcoin with 21m coins. Litecoin is almost exactly that, in fact.

SW is the solution given after about two years of watching a slow-moving train wreck as the blocks get ever fuller and nothing gets done about it. It arrives just in time to be pitched as the answer to a problem engineered by the same team. Notably, it does not undo the last two years of regrettable happenings.
I have partaken in small casual transactions before, as have many other regulars in here. I would have found those experiences considerably less fun If I had had to wait a day or two for my humble bundle payment to get rejected. That's perhaps why I have abstained from attempting a similar transaction in recent months, and I doubt I am alone in being intimidated by the current situation. That alone is reducing bitcoin's utility, and yet it is entirely invisible on every chart.
Also let's not just focus on our little sheltered western lives. main page frequently features mentions of exotic locales such as India or Venezuela, both heralded as being ripe markets for Bitcoin. Perhaps they would be, but what we would consider trivial amounts are rather less trivial in those countries, which makes posts about [bitcoin stickers seen in an Indian grocery store](rather sad, once one does the math about it. It's walking a fine line between wishful thinking and wasted opportunity.
I have no doubt you'll find ways to downplay all of this. And if that fails, you'll mention again that SegWit solves all of those fictional issues anyway.
Bitcoin has been damaged over the course of those past few years. The community has been damaged and your vitriolic tone here, the new normal around these parts, doesn't even scratch the surface of it while Bitcoin's own potential and reach has been damaged by the purposeful inaction of an engineering team that has fancied themselves negotiators, politicians and economists while being none of these things effectively.

According to 


For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 36,160 satoshis.
At current market rates, that's 0.367 USD, or very roughly 1300 bolivars.
Now, the Venezuelan government just raised the minimum wage considerably, to 40,638 bolivars a month, or 1336 bolivars a day.
So, in effect, the fee of a single bitcoin transaction would cost a minimum wage worker his entire daily income.
I say "would" because none of those people will use bitcoin. 
The hypothetical risk of excluding developing countries by filling up their bandwidth is dwarfed by the very real effect of excluding developing countries by pricing them out of using bitcoin in the first place.

data caps would be a problem, but without net neutrality, it can get much worse than that.
think of the current "data caps but unlimited for cool services X, Y and Z" bullshit various mobile ISPs are currently offering. that can be extended further, so that ISPs provide unlimited internet, but only to the stuff ordinary people need. So you get unlimited access to Alexa's top 500 sites, for example. data caps for the rest of the web, and all that other weird stuff gets blocked. FTP, bitttorrent, bitcoin and such are just how grandmas get viruses. Better keep them safe.
once that's accepted as a fact of life, folks would need to pay extra for the ISP plans that enable VPN access (those would be the business plans. not cheap), then run their unusual services somewhere in the cloud.

doing nothing is not terrible. you'd get a copy of all your coins on both sides of the fork. If one of the sides has the good taste of dying, everything's back to normal and you didn't have to do a thing.
if both sides insist on existing for whatever vexing reason, you'll need to start caring when you want to make a transaction.
at that point, it could still be fairly simple (you have two wallets instead of one, but everything still works), or it could become more annoying (you must transfer your bitcoins into a new address on both sides before you can use them safely.)   
it's hard to tell more without seeing the specifics of what is still mostly an hypothetical hard fork at this point.

They're comparable to a younger Bitcoin, from long before the Great Weirdness.  
But already there are alternative implementations for some of the stuff that are not under the foundation's control. For example, ethcore.io has an independent Rust implementation that isn't managed by the foundation (and I've seen a few snappy exchanges between devs on both sides, which seems to confirm some measure of independence.)
A takeover, be it from a government or a few individuals with a nefarious agenda, is possible in my mind, but not easy. It would have to be ostensibly covert.    
The entirety of the source for nodes, wallets miners and dev tools is fully open and anyone can audit it, so the agenda would need to be implemented in a way that can appear to be justified publicly. Control of public discussion forums would greatly help for that purpose, and a concerted effort would need to..
Well, I'm just repeating myself at this point, aren't I.
One truly fundamental difference however is the PoS stuff, coming up Soon^tm. That will change its decentralization profile, and I'm not sure yet if that will create issues. That's what I'd be watching carefully. If it succeeds and shows it can maintain desirable decentralization characteristics, it could perhaps provide some inspiration to other blockchains.

On chain transactions can deliver both.
Bitcoin had a huge first mover and network effect advantage, but unfortunately that does not mean it will always be on top.
Regardless of everyone's intentions, it looks like we may end up with another system being able to fulfill Bitcoin's initial requirements better than Bitcoin.
What it means for the future is up in the air. Maybe an inter bank settlement network really is the killer app, and Ripple was right all along. But most of the excitement I've seen in this subreddit over the years had been over scenarios where little people are able to do things that should be simple and cheap but were neither.

I don't believe this "onerous economic burden" claim. The computational cost of mining a block is much higher than the computational cost of running contracts for any given block in the EVM. 
Comparing the success of ethereum with bitcoin's "security standards" is weird. The author probably means to compare the hashing of each chain. Ethereum is much younger and less known than bitcoin. Maybe that has something to do with it.
But if folks find themselves unable to get their transactions included on the bitcoin blockchain for whatever reason (ahem), that may encourage them to give other systems a closer look.

I think the possible answers are generally one of:
1. Soon^TM  
2. They've been there for years, but there's made from such fine opcodes that the hopelessly stupid cannot see them.  
3. As soon as Bitcoin sprouts the ability to have actual sidechains, at which point altcoin variants that actually have smart contracts will be able to use "bitcoins" with them. See also 1.  
To elaborate a bit, point 2. captures the few special cases that managed to get opcoded into bitcoin, such as multisig and checklocktimeverify. The few use cases built on top of those opcodes probably qualify as smart contract, but you may feel barely whelmed looking at them, as they don't quite capture the full potential behind the concept.
point 3. is what Blockstream is kinda sorta working on. Except what they're selling so far are "federated sidechains", which means they break from bitcoin's decentralized model to build a settlement platform. If this sounds eerily like Ripple, I am sure it's entirely coincidental.  
I'd imagine a team of  true believers bitcoin devs would make it a priority to have actual decentralized sidechains. As soon as that happens, through blockstream or someone else, it should become possible to have actual honest to goodness pie-in-the-sky smart contracts.  
The bitcoin.it wiki has had a [page about smart contracts]( for almost 5 years, so.. See point 1.
Note that I purposefully didn't mention adding a lot of new opcodes to Bitcoin to enable general smart contracts natively, because that's less likely to happen than even point 3. by many orders of magnitude.

As a corollary, if you hold bitcoin on an exchange, or a managed wallet (coinbase, or whatever), and a HF occurs, there's no way to predict what you will own afterward, as it will be entirely at the discretion of the service you're trusting to hold your bitcoin.
Maybe you'll get both flavors of coin, maybe you'll get one, and maybe not the one you'd hoped for.

It's just another aspect of the "bitcoin as gold" vs "bitcoin as something useful" divide.

Of value, since that's the obsession of the day. Hunting for anything that maximizes value and avoiding anything that minimizes it is a great way to become trapped and missing on spots of greater values elsewhere in the graph.
Whenever a technical decision is being thought about, the impact it will have on the amount of gold you can buy with bitcoin should not come into play. Will the decision make bitcoin more useful? Will it make it more accessible? More resilient? Some other quality? Great. But if the focus becomes "protecting a store of value", then focus has been replaced by myopia, dooming bitcoin to eventual failure, or worse, stagnation.
Bitcoin has no usability as a store of value. Its value goes all over the place. Making decisions that aim to avoid lowering the price for the sake of making it more usable is just as insane as making decisions that avoid raising the price. I imagine one could argue for both in good faith, so as to keep bitcoin as very usable currency with a very predictable price.
If we're perhaps more honest, Bitcoin is making some of us rich. Like, stupid rich, and for doing literally nothing except having played around with it a few years ago. Who in their right mind would want to ruin a good thing like that? Just don't rock the boat and hope it keeps rising forever.  
But that's not Bitcoin. Its very existence is a major rocking of the boat. It was designed to be something that had never been. It was supposed to change things for the better. If its community sees it as nothing more than a mean to wealth, then it has failed in its most basic purpose.
That's why Bitcoin needs to embrace technical innovation first, second and third. The amount of gold you can exchange them for should be very far down the list.

There have been a number of discussions on this subreddit, where prominent dwellers have argued that various changes should not even be considered on the basis that it would be too risky to bitcoin's large market cap. In a sense, the (bad) idea is that Bitcoin has a responsibility to its shareholders similar to that of a corporation. If you believe this has never happened, I'm afraid I can't dig up an example just yet, but keep watching the conversations, you will see it expressed again.
Maybe hard forks? Heralded as the great evil that could destroy bitcoin, the argument most often repeated against them is that they will destroy value, to the point that folks like me who think hard forks are a good idea, not to mention the only reasonable way to keep miners in check, are reduced to pointing out how some other prominent controversial hard fork out there didn't result in a loss of exchange value, even though it's perhaps the least interesting aspect of a hard fork.
The price is a *lagging* indicator of bitcoin's usefulness. It also has a large amount of inertia baked in, which is partly what makes it so hard to pinpoint any particular price action to any particular news item. And of course speculators are greatly muddying up what we can only hope to be the long term price curve, the one we all hope is correlated to utility in some way.
Given that this long term rise can be disrupted for several years, using higher prices as a compass for future decisions would encourage us to do whatever keeps speculators happy.  
Is it that hard to foresee a darkest timeline of sort where Bitcoin has largely stopped being useful, but nobody cares because the price keeps going up, and it is after all the only metric that counts? Inertia keeps everybody happy, and by the time the price starts to catch up to the situation, it'd be way too late to correct anything without facing a long walk through the desert.

He wasn't. He just tried to explain to you that not all bitcoins have the same price point. The spot price only applies to a tiny fraction of bitcoins. As bitcoins get bought and sold, the spot price moves in either direction. 
When there's a lot of pressure to buy bitcoins, potential sellers become harder to find, and even harder to convince to sell at a bargain.
And then there are irrational actors, like Defusion55 or myself, who have no inclination to sell at any price. Which doesn't mean I'll never sell, just that it will happen only when I'm ready, not when some moneybag asks me to, and even then only in relatively tiny amounts.
For those reasons, you could have someone spend incredible amounts of money trying to buy every single bitcoin in the world, and they simply would not be able to afford it. Nor would they be able to tell whether they've actually acquired every available bitcoin. A lost bitcoin and a bitcoin in cold storage look exactly the same to an outside observer.
That doesn't mean there aren't other attacks that could be done by someone with a lot of money, but buying All The Bitcoins^tm simply isn't one of them.

When you make a deposit, the bank adds that to its own big pile of money. They also make a note somewhere that they probably owe you that money back at some point. It's not your money any more than the cash advance you can get from a credit card is the bank's money. They're going to want it back for sure, and they might even get pissy about it, but once you've got the cash, you get to do whatever you want with it. Same idea.
When you ask for a withdrawal, you're literally asking for the bank to dig into its own pocket, and pay you back that money you gave them that one time. Then you hope they remember, and that they're going to be cool about it.
It's so not your money that the bank has probably been using it to lend money to a bunch of other schmoes, or maybe to pay back someone else, and when you ask for it back and they decide to go for it, they just get it from wherever they can at that time. Most likely from whoever else thought it was a good idea to make a deposit that day.
That's why bank runs are so much fun. Banks never keep enough money to repay everything they owe, by design. It's just bad business to do otherwise.
If you don't have the private key, it's not your money. Or whatever the equivalent may be here.
If you want it to be your money, use a mattress, or a trezor.
Going half-ass with a notion that "I sent my money to MtGox Of America, but it's definitely still my money and I can take it out whenever I want" is bound to disappoint. At that point, you've earned the right to jump through whatever hoops is thrown your way in the hope you'll get something back, and you like it.

Who is behind this site? Ed Moy?  
They certainly paste his name all over the place. Oh, I know, let's look at their [contact page]( which is the closest thing they have to telling us who they are.  
By which I mean they don't tell you who they are at all, but if you google their street address, you'll find it matches a lot of other businesses, including the ["Fortress Gold Group"]( (featuring Ed Moy again, who apparently likes to collect exotic IRAs) and [Lending USA]( and its SEO-targeted micro sites( [Medical Financing]( [Bridal Loans]( and probably more.)
At that point, if you keep digging, you'll eventually find out some company named "FIGURE EIGHT ENTERPRISE", same street address, that is in the process of applying for a "BITCOINIRA" trademark, probably hoping it'll go better than their "PERSONAL STORAGE GOLD IRA" trademark.
After that, keep digging and you'll find the agent for the company as well as the principal for it, who's probably the real power behind the throne.

I played with a calculator earlier, and it looks like the cutoff point after which mining on an S7 wasn't profitable anymore was around 11 cents per Wh, which is below the average retail cost of electricity, but still achievable in places.
That drops to 5.5 cents per Wh after the Halvening, which is very likely to hurt at least some miners.

You tried something hard and you fail. You suck!" to "Well that looked interesting. What can we do to help?"
Fwiw, I see the value proposition of ethereum as enabling generalized smart contracts (as opposed to the few special cases we've had to be satisfied with so far.)

I'm not sure you're disagreeing with the parent comment.
Hardforks can be very powerful since they explicitly change the consensus rules, and as such require large explicit buy-in from the network.
Softforks in contrast are a near-literal devil, since they slip through the details of consensus rules to change something meaningful about the network without requiring buy-in from network nodes. As long as enough miners apply the softfork, it becomes a de facto change that everybody just has to live with. For some of those consensus-neutral changes, "enough miners" can be just one. It's weird.
I view softforks as more dangerous than hardforks, and wonder if the mere possibility of them is an indication that consensus rules are too blurry for the network's own good, leaving it open to various and potentially unwanted changes.

Ok, so if you agree that bitcoin was in fact available to all interested investors, and that your example about a government artificially restricting access to bonds has nothing to do with bitcoin, I'm not sure what's left to argue.
Yes, Bitcoin follows a pre-determined formula to make more bitcoin appear out of thin air regularly, and that creates a very predictable inflation of supply, but I don't see how the existence of inflation invalidates past returns. 
Would you argue that the inflation of the dollars makes discussing the long term returns of a USD forex pair meaningless?
To be more specific, the article linked claims "you could have booked an annual return of nearly 82% each of the last three years"  (rather than "the first bitcoins mined" as you wrote in an earlier comment.)  
Over the same period, the total bitcoin supply went from about 12 millions at the beginning of 2013, to about 16 millions at the beginning of 2016, or very roughly 10% yearly.  
We're not into Venezuelan territory, but that's quite a bit higher than the 2% goal rate for the USD for example.
That high inflation would be expected to work against the overall returns, and yet we're seeing ridiculous yearly returns anyway.
Now the trick is, those high returns measure two things: speculation and adoption. The speculation is the part of the chart that goes all wibbly wobbly and get people incredibly excited and incredibly depressed over disturbing short time intervals.   
It tends to even itself out over a long enough period of time. Is 3 years long enough? I'm not sure.  
The adoption part is the more interesting one. If you squint at a long term bitcoin price chart just right and ignore all the peak and valleys, you'll see a fairly simple geometric shape (a line if your price axis is in log mode, a curve otherwise.) That's probably a reflection of the actual interest in bitcoin, resulting in them buying into bitcoin somewhat durably.
The reason that matters is because the long term price of bitcoin is likely to continue to correlate to its overall adoption, rather than any other traditional metrics. In practical terms, that means that even if everything works out in the best possible way, at some point the world is going to run out of potential new bitcoin adopters. About half way before that, the current exponential shape of the price graph is going to hit an inflection point, and then start to slow down, taking the shape of a [logistic function](
That inflection point would really mark the beginning of the end for crazy bitcoin returns, assuming anyone could accurately spot it among all the speculation noise.  
But assuming we haven't already passed it, it's not unreasonable to expect more of the same until then.
(Disclaimer: only crazy people should ever invest in bitcoin.)

it smells a bit like a cryptocurrency. There's a ledger, ostensibly distributed, some would (wrongly imho) argue decentralized. Rules are applied and validated by the full nodes, however few of them there are. Everybody else is a light node at best, trusting the full nodes to keep a reasonable approximation of the truth. Some of the early ledger blocks went missing, making tracking funds from the genesis block impossible, but it doesn't break anything, since nobody is seriously expected (nor as it turns out, fully able) to verify the entire ledger.  
I've long wondered if it might be possible to fork a modern Ripple codebase into a properly decentralized network, or if the consensus protocol would hopelessly break down absent a convenient quorum of trusted hosts.
More interesting in my mind are the parallels between nowadays' Ripple business model of selling lightning fast and secure blockchain services to banks, and what Blockstream is getting into.

The common wisdom here is that after every big market move, you should rebalance your portfolio to your chosen asset allocation.
In your case, that'd mean selling some of your GBTC, essentially locking in some of your gain. Later, if (when) things go back down again, you get to rebalance again.
This is as close to a systematic approach to "buy low, sell high" that most of us will ever get to.

There is only one Bitcoin ecosystem.  
There's a leadership that has made a power grab to solidify its control over it, the same group that is now too uncertain in the bitcoin community to straightforwardly ask them to adopt a hard fork and is reduced to weasel their changes through a convoluted soft fork instead. 
The answer to that situation is not to pretend it isn't happening, nor is it to go play on another blockchain, although the latter may become the path more traveled if things continue in this direction.  
That would of course be a shame.

If the behavior of the bitcoin network as a whole doesn't seem to match the expectations of a subreddit, maybe that subreddit has simply stopped being representative of the bitcoin community.

Code is not law, not even with bitcoin. Code consensus is strictly a function of social consensus. If the social consensus changes, then code will eventually have to change to reflect that. This is a strictly one-way street, as social consensus does not change to match code. Hence code is not law if you look far enough.
The gaps in the consensus as implemented in bitcoin's current code are wide enough that you can drive a change as complex and large as segwit right through them. 
Who knows what else miners could force us to adopt without our consent, using the very same approach.
Winners don't soft fork.

aww man. I'm trying to be nice and explain things slowly, but I really don't think I'm the one confused here. 
As a point of comparison, the very first block that Satoshi mined, back in 2009, 4 years before the time period the article refers to, introduced 50 bitcoins to the network. Every block thereafter for the next 4 years created another 50 bitcoins, every ten minutes.
Now the unit "bitcoin" is somewhat arbitrary in that it doesn't represent an elementary unit of exchange. That'd be the [satoshi]( To rephrase with that unit:
The very first block that Satoshi mined, back in 2009, introduced 5 billion satoshis to the network. Roughly every 10 minutes hereafter, another 5 billion satoshis were introduced to the network.
For the period the article focuses on, there were between 1,200,000,000,000,000 and 1,600,000,000,000,000 satoshis available on the network. 
It seems improbable that you would argue with a straight face that this is "identical" to the situation in your example, yet here we are.

A soft fork is a subversion of the social consensus done by taking advantage of an insufficiently thorough code consensus implementation.

It looks like business as usual: 
The accusation of "network spam" seems unlikely to me. The link you give shows a steady stream of plausible transactions. But maybe we have an attacker that's trying really hard to be sneaky about it? Probably not.
My boring theory here is that congestion on the mempool is simply a function of the blocks being full, or at least they'd be full were it not for some peculiar miner policies.
So this is another round of the "Replace By Fee" dance. There aren't enough chairs for everyone to sit down at the end of the dance, so a good chunk of those transactions will eventually simply fall off the mempool.
Folks have predicted this would happen for years, along with a simple fix that'd buy us time to do something better for the long run, and they've consistently been told to shove it.
So we have been put in a position where we are out of time. Whatever is being pushed down our throats must now be adopted as-is, or bitcoin will slowly rot.
This is all by design, improbable as it may seem.

Go to their [SEC filing]( it seems like this is a subtle ruse to convince the SEC to approve them.
Up to 25% of the fund is going to go straight to a shady cayman island subsidiary that's not limited by SEC rules and will be able to invest directly in "bitcoin instruments" (at least some of which should be actual bitcoin, but who knows). That makes the ~25% chunk a "bitcoin derivative" since the ETF itself is never directly invested in bitcoin.


and then at least 75% goes into some BS cash or cash-equivalent stuff, which waters down the volatility and potential returns considerably. 
This reads like an attempt to set a lower-bound on what kind of Bitcoin ETF the SEC will approve. In the process, they create a terrible ETF that may or may not find a market. ("I want exposures to bitcoin, but without all the crazy upside and volatility please.")
Will the SEC see through this shell game? Will they feel that the risk to investors has been sufficiently lowered by loading the ETF with US securities and bonds?
Stay tuned.

Well the main difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is how they change consensus.
A soft fork changes consensus by taking advantage of what's left unsaid in the consensus code. The nodes and services don't need to change for that to happen, and they also don't get a say in whether this soft fork happens or not. The miners are the ones that fill up some of that unsaid code with new rules that they themselves enforce. Hence, only miners have a say on whether a soft fork happens or not.
A hard fork changes consensus by making a clean break from previous consensus. It's an explicit change, and requires every participant in the bitcoin network to not only be aware of it, but also to choose whether to adopt the new rules or not.
So the 60% figure, frequently seen when talking about segwit nowadays, is only meaningful for a hard fork. That so many people feel that it is relevant in those discussions is an indirect expression of the notion that segwit should itself be a hard fork.
In the same vein, when we see comments complaining about miners holding back segwit, and how they have too much power, it's important to understand that this soft fork gave them that power in the first place, and that a hard fork would have given a great number of bitcoin participants a voice that are currently lacking.
Yet, "hard fork" is a dirty word around here, because it conjures notions of reduced market prices, to the point that they are effectively unable to not be emotional about it.
The same people that find themselves complaining about miners and node percentages are therefore unable to continue their own thoughts and realize that they're in fact subtly arguing in favor of a hard fork.

How high do you figure interest rates would need to get before people stop being interested in Bitcoin?


Recessions strongly imply a drop in overall spending in the economy. If the primary effect of an economic crisis was to increase spending, we would not call it a recession.  
That doesn't mean some folks won't be struggling to pay the bills.  
Recessions suck for a reason. But the wider pattern will overwhelmingly be one of saving money rather than spending it.
My naive take on this is that the lack of correlation is probably beneficial as part of a diversification strategy that will reduce a portfolio's overall risk, including various form of economic crisis.  The bitcoin price curve so far has more to do with adoption and speculation about adoption than anything else, but there's a decent chance it may continue to go its own way even after reaching saturation. Hard to tell at this point, though.  
Regardless, it's not an absolute defense. It would probably do poorly in a full on Mad Max/Kenshiro scenario. But intuitively, many portfolios would likely benefit from having some amount of bitcoin in them. I wonder if someone's done some efficient frontier analysis of that sort of thing.

I'd strongly be in favor of a hard fork fully enabling 2-way pegs.
I'm not sure about your question though. The consensus in bitcoin broke around the time the community became fragmented, and is only being artificially held in code through inertia and avoiding getting any direct consensus feedback from a hard fork, pushing instead for soft forks.
I am, perhaps naively, holding on to the idea that the community could largely reconcile with relatively minor adjustments, which would allow disruptive hard forks like this one to sail through unhindered.
If that's not possible, then it's really just a matter of time before bitcoin's technical consensus breaks in a way that mirrors the popular consensus.

That's not the doom we were promised. All subsequent forks were boring, to a point where they happened only to quieten some noise, and weren't opposed by anyone.  
It's obvious to all parties involved that those forks would have happened regardless of the controversial fork's existence. It is similarly obvious that a number of additional forks, some quite dramatic in nature, will happen on Ethereum in the near future.
Painting those forks as indicating a downfall of Ethereum precipitated by the ETH/ETC hard fork is plainly inaccurate to anyone who actually follows Ethereum. 
But beyond chest thumping as an approximation for a reasoned argument, the biggest flaw in your thinking is the idea that hard forks can be pushed by central entities. Unlike soft forks that can be sneaked upon ordinary users as long as enough miners are complicit, hard forks require a hard opt-in from everyone to take effect.  
This is what allowed ETC to exist. It is what will protect Ethereum from any attempt at an hard fork that doesn't have actual community support. It is also what will protect Bitcoin from the same.
It doesn't matter how bold agencies get as long as users have a choice of what software to run.
Good thing there's a rich ecosystem of client software to pick from to ensure that no single software provider can exert any undue influence upon a community, because this, and only this, will keep us safe, rather than some nebulous and unjustifiable fear of hard forks.

I don't know what "behind our backs" means here. Should they have asked me if it was okay for them to sign a letter beforehand?
Or is there a subset of folks that doesn't include me that should be asked for permissions before signing letters?
Regarding "political methods", it's important to acknowledge that those methods cover a lot more than than signing a letter. Writing a post or a comment trying to sway opinions, for example, qualifies strongly as a political method.
But "political" is not a dirty word, recent developments notwithstanding.   
The bitcoin consensus itself is fundamentally a political animal, despite some illusions of being a purely technical entity. Consensus code can only ever represent consensus from people. And political methods such as the ones used in this very thread are a mean to try to influence the eventual direction of that consensus.
Finally, how sure are you that throwing money at any of those projects will have a positive impact on the overall health of the bitcoin ecosystem? Are you listing projects that are active and explicitly require funding to reach their stated goals?

If we pretend that bitcoin is not a political animal, segwit is a technical improvement, and if the only choices are segwit or nothing, segwit is literally better than nothing.
I suspect the resistance we're seeing here reflects the idea that there should be other choices on the table.

What I've seen is that the bitcoin leadership has communicated in no uncertain terms that it's either segwit or nothing. 
That is, if segwit doesn't pass, nothing else will.
You may have reservations about aspects of segwit like the weird hacks to force fit it into a soft fork while otherwise finding merits in some of the technical improvements, but those reservations are worthless. 
You must either embrace segwit as defined and implemented by the core team, or be resigned to see bitcoin falter and fall into neglect. 
Those are the only two options.

The great thing about controversial HF is that we don't have to reason entirely in a vacuum anymore. We have a live one to observe, with ETH/ETC.
ETH forked with 85% of mining power if I remember correctly. ETC trucked along with their appeal to strong immutability and eventually settled at ~10% mining power and ~10% market. ETH claimed a successful hard fork and moved on. They had the longer chain as well, as tradition demanded.
Fast forward a few months, and with some fairly ordinary fluctuations of hashing power, despite ETH having an order of magnitude higher difficulty than ETC, ETC became the longest chain.
And do you know what happened on that fateful day? Nothing. Someone posted a few over-excited posts on the ETC subreddit, and nobody cared. Nothing changed.
It's still the longer chain right now. 3000 blocks ahead! Did you know about it? No? Nobody else does either.
That leads me to wonder if this "longer chain" metric is really meaningful, rather than the perhaps more straightforward "more miners want to mine this chain", or "more nodes want to run on this chain", or maybe just "there's a more active ecosystem on this chain"
Checkpointing would not have changed either chains' length. It would not prevent individual nodes or miners from being on one chain or the other. It can be done at any time without a fork as a plain client update.
Finally, whoever designs a hard fork can trivially make it fully backward incompatible so that clients will need to make a hard choice and won't be able to be half-committed as in your example. I think that may be a good practice in general.

I'm mostly split-neutral. 
But I've seen the Ethereum split as it happened. All the weight that was pulled into keeping the minority fork alive (with a number of financially significant players who would benefit from Ethereum failing, including Barry Silbert himself throwing his hat in the ring), and all the brouhaha that followed. The sudden recognition of the minority chain by poloniex, the belabored attempt at community-building around the minority chain, and its slow path toward meaning.
This was a rather bad blow against Ethereum. And yet, once the dust settled, Ethereum kept going. There's now something called ETC out there, which attracts a small community of believers and which isn't terribly different from any other ethereum-based altcoin out there.  
Notably, there wasn't any kind of dramatic price event caused by the split. The mining difficulty wasn't meaningfully impacted either.
So, one has to wonder. How much worse would it be if a split happened with Bitcoin? Because if it went as bad as the Ethereum split went, it really doesn't seem that bad.
It's unreasonable to expect that Bitcoin will never have another hard fork. There is a limit to what can be hacked into a soft fork, and unless we accept that Bitcoin is as good as it's ever going to get (or decide that miners should be given much more trust than they already have), a hard fork will need to happen eventually.  
And yet hard forks are the one time where every participant in the bitcoin ecosystem gets a vote in what happens next. If there is a division in the community, it is likely to be reflected in the result of the hard fork.
The answer here is not to desperately try to postpone hard forks forever at the expense of bitcoin's technical evolution, but to work toward reconciliation in the community in so far as that it still possible. But I've seen no attempts so far, so who can tell.

Maybe it would be more accurate to say that soft forks pervert consensus.
As in, there are intended consensus rules, and implemented consensus rules that tend to be a somewhat looser set of those intended rules.
Soft forks live in the dirty cracks between the two, and abuse existing implementations to change the consensus intent.
In contrast, hard forks are done by changing the consensus implementation explicitly, and avoid all the sneaky fuckery that comes with soft forks.

Gresham's law. As long as bitcoin is seen as more valuable than other competing currencies, folks will prefer to unload those other currencies first.
Trying to shame folks is unlikely to change that. The only thing that will make folks start to spend their bitcoin is for it to start appearing less valuable than, or at least roughly as valuable as other currencies.
Alternatively, if other currencies collapse, people may not have a choice anymore and bitcoin will start being spent.
The first scenario is one of bitcoin's "failure" states, although that's not necessarily a catastrophic failure. 
The second one is basically a catastrophic success, where everything else goes to shit. Probably not the outcome you want to root for, although it'd certainly maximize bitcoin's value.

That is true, but incomplete. There has also been a consistent cultural consolidation of the core client as the only safe client, and a portrayal of any other client as risky and dangerous. This builds upon the relative lack of technical knowledge of bitcoin users to make up their own mind without helpful expert opinions, and consistently directed efforts to keep the largest community sites "on message" when this topic is brought up.
It's one thing for a client to naturally become dominant (and really, it's hard work to avoid), but it's another to have community leaders repeatedly communicate that this dominance is good and wholesome, and must be maintained for the good of bitcoin.

In a pure world of reason, that would be true. In a world where few people understand the code, or the implications of a change, and where everybody is frequently told that using anything other than Core brings "risk and instability" (quote taken from this very comment chain, but it's literally everywhere), there's a very clear message to discourage people from ever trying something else. Just stick to what's safe. 
This risk aversion culture has other strange implications. Hard forks are now believed to be terrifying, and changes that would be better designed with a hard fork (almost everything, including segwit) are instead pushed through as soft forks, to avoid having to ask the opinion of ordinary bitcoin users who cannot be trusted to make the right choice. It's too much of a risk.

You certainly avoid instability, but you're not avoiding risk, merely trading some risks for others. New projects almost always start with just one implementation and one team, and that's reasonable. But I don't believe it's healthy in the long run.  
I'm not sure what you mean by "compatible" and "incompatible" in your comment. The other bitcoin clients have a negligible market share and, not coincidentally, have almost zero impact on bitcoin's evolution. It's great that they exist, but as they stand, they do little to balance the obvious central chokepoint.
I can think of another, younger cryptocurrency that has managed to foster an ecosystem of compatible clients from multiple independent dev teams. They've even sprouted a persistent hard fork, once thought to be a worst case scenario, and well, things are still chugging along for them. Yet even they are struggling with having a dominant dev team and client, but at least they're aware of it and the community is frequently encouraging folks to try alternatives.  
Will they manage to avoid the problems created by having a central dev team in the long run? I'm not sure. Companies in a free market naturally turn into monopolies absent any regulation, and similarly clients tend to consolidate their market shares into a single implementation. All that can be done to perhaps prevent it is to foster and maintain node diversity across the community, where client monocultures are understood to be problematic.
Of course, managing the culture and the attitude of a crypto community is another huge can of worm around here, but you can see where that intersects with our discussion.

Right that's the trick: If you have public stock and you do shady ICO stuff, the SEC can shutdown your stock trading.
This isn't so much an incentive to not do shady ICO stuff as it is an incentive to keep ICOs and stocks separate, and the SEC post essentially spells it out.
That doesn't mean there can't be actions against pure ICO plays, but there no obvious pressure point, and it would probably need to be treated as a cyber crime investigation, with a whole bunch of snooping and tracking. That's an entirely different level from just pulling the plug on a given stock ticker, both in term of complexity and effort spent, and in terms of threshold of fraudulent activity to meet in order to even start something like that.

Yes, let's be [optimistic and forward looking]( about this.
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:13:59
"segwit or nothing" means that if segwit doesn't pass, the bitcoin leadership will not let anything else pass either. I could find supporting quotes for this if it seems too outlandish.
I don't doubt that things will continue on their planned roadmap if segwit passes. I don't know if a flat size increase is on that roadmap, but I've learned to appreciate optimism as a virtue. 
I don't know how to answer your claim that there is no Bitcoin leadership when it's obvious to anyone else.   Segwit didn't form from a vacuum. The policy decisions surrounding it didn't either. What is leadership if not the ability to control the direction in which things move?
It's telling that you couldn't even finish that paragraph without an appeal to authority.
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:47:01
That's only true if the community consists entirely of Core and of people that fully agree with Core's current policies.
While it's easy to perceive the events that led to creation as a form of excommunication, it is reasonable to see us as still being part of the community.
Under this more encompassing definition, increasing the block size would remain a decision taken entirely within the community rather than from the outside.
I'm familiar with the invocation of slippery slopes. Ethereum was painted by some as a blockchain that will endlessly revert its state from now on, ever since they forked to move the balance of two addresses. I don't believe it was anything more than transparent fear mongering then, and I'm not sure this is very different.
@_date: 2016-12-04 13:18:20
It's tricky to match events to short term price changes. If you look at a ETH price chart, the price shot up right after the fork (july 20th). Then it shot down a week or two later. Then it went back up again. Which of those moves were related to the fork if any?  
I certainly can't tell, just like I've never been really able to tell why the bitcoin price goes up or down. The only thing I understand it that over long enough periods of time, bitcoin does well because it's proving to be useful to people.
Worrying too much about market prices result in a tendency to let the tail wag the dog. I believe the best course of action in general is to improve the underlying platform and its ecosystem to make it as useful as possible, and let the price speculators catch up to that on their own timetable.
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:04:12
It's a diverse crowd. Personally, I'll feel a lot better about bitcoin once there's a plurality of independently developed clients where none of them has an overwhelming market share they can use to push an agenda, and individual nodes, users and miners have an effective choice toward which developer team gets to lead the evolution of their consensus.
Until then, I shall embrace my bitterness and growing disinterest in short term bitcoin happenings, while faintly hoping that the ecosystem eventually manages to escape the trap it's currently in.
In that optic, scaling is a fairly tiny piece of the picture. Sure, letting blocks get full when there was plenty of lead time is, applying Hanlon's razor, plainly stupid and likely damaged bitcoin's adoption by discouraging various use cases, but even if segwit or whatever else deliver some glorious scaling, it won't fix bitcoin's underlying governance issue.

I don't know. Maybe we're not repeating often enough that bitcoin is famous for crashing hard, and will crash again. I expect people should know about it by now and have planned for it accordingly, but maybe not.
The folks that are taking loans to buy bitcoin are most likely to end up in that "panic sell" category, and will be easily shaken loose by even a relatively mild crash. For all the warnings that it's a really really dumb idea, CME and their futures thingy isn't going to help things on that front either. Maybe futures markets are magic and will allow wise investors to carefully hedge their investments. Or maybe it will finally usher a proper bitcoin bubble fueled by folks that can't afford for the price to go down much at all, lest they lose everything.

@_date: 2017-11-05 04:49:11
It's not a terrible assumption. But he's also assuming almost nobody's cashing out, and that's a lot less likely.
There are certainly some "forever hodlers", that intend to never cash out. And those are fine, for the purpose of this discussion they present no risk to the market value.
There are also active traders, that believe they can zig and zag around bitcoin faster that the wind can change. Regardless of their effectiveness, they create liquidity of a sort, and while they can trigger interesting short term movements, they are generally harmless to the long term market value.
That leaves the planners. You know the type. They have a stash, they have a spreadsheet, and they've mapped out profit taking strategies when various price points are reached. Those folks have already taken some profits, and they continue to do so, largely mechanically, as new price points are reached. They account for a large amount of the price action resistance during bull markets, and their effect is both already factored into the price, and overall fairly predictable (yes, a lot of folks will continue to take profits as the price rise. it should not surprise anyone.)
So, who does that leave? Is there a throng of anxious bitcoiners out there that are holding large amounts and are all waiting for a large synchronized mass panic to all sell together and drop the price to OP's $500 floor? My intuition says no.

the term "meme" has been bastardized to hell because GIFs of cat are more aesthetically pleasing that boring string of words, but money has a strong memetic component, and bitcoin is a significant mutation of that particular concept.

I mostly agree. We're way past due for a slow crash. Not a measly 40% drop that recovers after a week or two, but another one of those years-long desert crossing streaks where everybody slowly despairs and speculators graciously GTFO.
Or at least that's what I was saying 6 months ago. I don't really know what's going on at this point with the price. If Bitfinex stubbornly persists on not violently imploding, this could keep going for a while. I'm guessing speculators don't really realize that Bitcoin isn't just a harmless bag that can be passed around, and that the higher the market value gets, the sooner the worldwide financial shakeup that Bitcoin is designed to induce will actually start happening, through hyperbitcoinization.
On the one hand, we've been talking about it for years here, so it's not like we didn't warn them. On the other hand, the notion that a few lines of code ran by a few folks can literally disrupt money seems completely insane so nobody's going to take it seriously until it's too late to do much of anything about it.

That seems completely wrong. The bitcoin money supply is algorithmically defined and has nothing to do with its exchange rate. It is currently increasing at a fixed rate of 12.5 bitcoins per block, which happen on average every 10 minutes.

A big part of your problem is that you're still primarily using fiat on both sides of the transaction.  
In the slightly dystopian future with cyberpunk overtones where nation-states are mostly just something kids learn about in their history moocs, fiat currencies aren't really a thing anymore.  
You may still need to trade between cryptos, but the mechanisms to do so would be entirely automated, decentralized, and easily replicated, driving exchange fees as low as physically possible.
Until that, or something like it happens, you're stuck with central choke-points to convert value between fiat and crypto, and you should expect that local governments will exert all kind of pressure on them, with at best various bits of regulations that translate into additional costs passed on to customers, and at worst outright bans and exclusions of entire groups from participating in those exchanges.

It's a different blockchain whose primary token is pegged to Bitcoin's value. The only way to acquire a token on a sidechain is to lock/freeze an equivalent amount of bitcoin, and the only way to reclaim that bitcoin is to surrender that sidechain token.
It's really not meant to enable speculation, but rather functionality that bitcoin itself doesn't have.  
The main thing that's making me pause about it is how the peg between the two blockchains is maintained. I believe right now that still requires some trusted servers, which means it's kinda broken by design.
Once it becomes possible to tie two blockchains together properly, I expect we'll see a veritable explosion of sidechains, which could well result in further consolidation of market shares for the coins that attract most of them.

If you want to become a bitcoin politician, that's fine. Just don't expect people to trust you with technical matters anymore.
An altcoin can co-exist peacefully with bitcoin. That has been true of every single altcoin, and will continue to be true.    
BIP 101 is not an altcoin. It's a change to the network rules. Like every other such change, it requires a majority of bitcoin nodes to be adopted. 
In spite of what that graph implies, there cannot be any durable co-existence of the BIP 101 blockchain and the "Real Bitcoin^tm" blockchain. If BIP 101 is supported a majority of nodes, then the Real Bitcoin blockchain will support BIP 101, and that's it. Nobody in their right mind will persist on trying to keep an alternative blockchain running in parallel. Because it's not an altcoin, and it doesn't work like an altcoin.
So why is a "core dev" pushing misleading statements supported by a dishonest graph that attempts to rewrite history and muddy the waters as to what is and isn't an altcoin?
Because there is by now a clear understanding that Bitcoin is a political entity. Convince the node owners of your narrative, and you will keep controlling the network and its future changes.
So, the neat thing here is that this is perhaps bitcoin's first political campaign.  
The less neat thing is that this is turning into an ugly shit-show where half-truths are being presented as fact and the control of discussion platforms is being actively leveraged to silence dissenting opinions.
This, in one word, is gross.

This is the True Curse of cryptocurrencies. People end up committing into one particular token and, because they can have literal fortunes riding on it, start to make series of strange decisions that feel very rational to them.
I was just thinking yesterday, watching that Post's Theorem witness video stuff "Hey cool, I wonder if the Ethereum devs could work on some of this stuff, maybe as a little side project or whatever", and my next thought was "But wait, they can't work on it unless they have a fully fleshed out roadmap to justify how this will eventually Be Good for Ethereum, or everyone will hate them."
The same idea applies to your bitcoinv2. Who would work on this? If any of the Bitcoin devs spend any time on it, they are literally betraying the combined financial interests of every bitcoin holder. So you only see other devs working on potential bitcoinv2. If bitcoinv2 were to take off, under the notion that all coins are part of a zero-sum game where winner takes all (after accounting for overall adoption growth), it would be damaging bitcoin. Therefore discussions around it must be shunned and certainly not encouraged. (also see "bitcoin maximalism")
The idea that we would be able to jump into bitcoinv2 early and maintain our wealth gap isn't enough to comfort us. There have been dozen of bitcoinv2 candidates, and so far we can't tell which ones are great bargains and which ones are complete shit shows until several years down the road.  
And yes, I'm judging those candidates entirely by their market performance, because that's ultimately what the Curse means. Technical merits become secondary. They're just bullet items to score points and convince folks to join our team so that together we may reach various celestial bodies.

Neither are what he's been pushing for.
The claims that a hard fork would split bitcoin durably into two currencies are false. Competing chains after a hard fork are inherently unstable, and rational actors have a strong incentive to switch to the winning fork immediately. Irrational actors will lose their shirts. Either way, the system quickly converges toward one blockchain again.
You are speculating that the entire Core developer team would fire themselves if a fork were to occur. Again, not a "rational actor" scenario, and certainly not anything compulsory forced upon the Core team.
You are promoting ideas that have no basis in reality. I'd call them strawmen, but they've been repeated around these parts often enough that it's essentially what you and others have been convinced will happen, so I can't really fault you for having internalized them yourself.

To give some context from Ethereum's approach, they have a concept of transaction contract calls, and "constant" contract calls. Both are running code written within a contract, but one runs entirely locally and never sends anything over the network. They're called the same way, and have almost the same shape.  
It'd almost be an implementation detail, except one consumes gas while the other is completely free.
Essentially, the fact that every user is expected to run a node means that the node gets to do as many optimizations and computations it wants before sending something over the wire, if it even needs to.
Those witness-facilitated transactions fall somewhere in between the two flavors of Ethereum calls. Some "constant" (aka local to the node) work needs to happen first, then some minimal dataset is spoon-fed to a transaction to prove the work happened and can legitimately update some state on the blockchain.  
It's easy to come up with specific use cases where that makes sense. It seems trickier to design a workable approach to solve general computation problems this way, but there are probably general patterns to derive from this that'd be frequently useful in practice.

Back of the envelope, if his net worth is around 2.5 billions, that's 250 millions USD in Ethereum+Bitcoin.  
Let's say it's a 50/50 split to keep things simple, that amounts to 100,000 BTC and 2,400,000 ETH.  
Rewinding back to his buying prices, assuming all his BTC was bought at $50 and all his ETC was bought at $1, that's an initial investment of 5 million dollars in bitcoin and 2.5 million dollars in ethereum, or altogether about 3% of his net worth combined. 
So it's probably not "tens of millions of dollars" invested in bitcoin, but it's still a sizable amount. Notably, he invested in Ethereum at a time when Ethereum literally did not exist, ie he paid the devs to build Ethereum.
Not mentioned here are any other altcoin he might also have thrown money into. 
If he and a handful of his whale buddies were willing to throw money at any altcoin that looked promising in some fashion, it would do a lot to explain the fanciful valuation of many altcoins that were coming out of the woods with no obviously discernible reason to do well.

That's pretty normal crap for Wikipedia. I've partaken in a few pointless arguments on wikipedia, only to be systematically overruled. On the plus side, sanity eventually seems to prevail, as every article that was once summarily deleted for lack of notability is now apparently thriving.

I've used ol' trusty Poclbm (with guiminer in front of it) while playing games and watching videos.
Most miners have parameters to automatically yield enough to allow the screen refresh to happen X times per second. Setting that to 60 has been sufficient to me to keep my desktop responsive, including during gaming, but it could be set higher to be extra nice, at the cost of lowering your hashrate average.
I recommend experimenting on your own box to get a feel for different values. Other miners have flags for "aggressiveness", which may or many not be a related concept.
In my case, my HD 5770 does around 230 MH/s when everything is idle. Watching an H264 video on one screen takes about ~40 MH/s away. Playing a game will usually bring the hashrate near 0, which is pretty much the desired behavior.

They could perceive a risk because they're seeing a high chargeback rate on bitcoin-related transactions, or because they're anticipating legal issues that could raise their liability exposure, or a bunch of other things.

Bitcoin exchangers have always been seen as an obvious point of attack, given their somewhat centralized nature.
So this is interesting, because it wasn't an attack on an exchanger, but on a mean to get money to exchangers. 


Essentially, Mastercard and co. decided that Paxum didn't get to do business with Bitcoin exchangers.
Even if this is not part of a conscious effort to weaken Bitcoin, whatever process made Mastercard decide that Bitcoin was too risky for Paxum to handle is most likely going to apply to okpay and dwolla.

Everything else sounds like stoner crap where lofty goals are presented as practical ideas, and people are expected to go "Woah, far out!" (no offense to actual stoners.)

- blockchain should use merged mining to not be completely pwnable from day 1.
- market orders are represented as transactions in the blockchain.
- cryptocoins tied to a market orders must be present within the market order, in a way that they can only be retrieved by the client who placed the order, or by the client that placed an order that was matched with this one. ( THIS IS THE HARD PART. )
- the blockchain moves relatively fast. Instead of a 10m tick, it would most likely be measured in seconds. ( optional. Would an exchange be significantly less useful if it only updated once every 10m on average? )
- two matching orders can only be resolved on a tick (when a new block is mined)
- miners are the clearinghouse. If a miner doesn't know what to do with an order (unknown altcoin type, etc.), the order is ignored. When/if a miner who knows what to do with it solves a block, it will be considered.
- fees would most likely be needed to incentify miners to actually mine. (goodbye, dream of a fee-free exchange.)
- as a result of two orders having been matched, underlying cryptocoins get released to predefined addresses, in a way that cannot be tampered by a malicious miners ( HARD PART. )
- market orders would have a maximum time limit baked in, after which they are no longer considered open and are to be ignored by miners. It is the market order's owner's responsibility to reclaim coins associated with those orders.
- this system would not solve currency exchanges out of the wonderful little world of bitcoin/altcoins.
So really, this just needs somewhat familiar with blockchain internals to come up with a few genius ideas to solve the hard parts, and you'd have a non-sucky, actually p2p cryptocoin exchange.
Too bad even then it would do nothing to help with exchanging between cryptocoins and legacy currencies.

This true story needs a whole lot more details to make sense to folks that don't follow your adventures.
For example, let folks know what little off-topic thing was said that started your long victimization on the forums, so they can know Theymos for the outrageous monster he truly is. 
I like the honesty concerning the repeated instances of ban evasion/sockpuppeting, but I'm not sure this will work in your favor.
The whole paragraph about colleagues under your account, nihilism and Vanessa makes absolutely no sense to me. If you're writing this for people who already know the whole story, great. But if not, you need to rewrite that junk, stat.

In their defense, this is almost a year old post. Bitcoin has somewhat matured since then. New exchanges have appeared, businesses are increasingly accepting it.
More interestingly, bad shit happened. Exchanges got hax0red, payment providers did nasty things, hax0rs stole large quantities of coins, yet Bitcoin didn't die.

It looks like JSONP is disabled for authenticated calls, so there's nothing obviously wrong here. Using JSONP for public data is fairly normal, as long as you trust the data provider not to screw with your own users.
The real ಠ_ಠ should be for the authentication method for the non-public APIs, taken straight from the stone age. Requiring 3d-party apps to have full access to your user's accounts is not okay, particularly when those accounts hold something of transferable value.
There's a standard way to authenticate APIs in a way that minimizes the user's exposure, allows to track access per application, etc.

There's simply no legitimate business that can multiply one's money unconditionally by a factor of more than 33 over a year. 
A few possible theories here:  
1. scam. too likely, too easy, therefore not interesting. only one week to wait to confirm anyway.  
2. facetious millionaire, who enjoys confusing the hell out of everybody by throwing money in their general direction. Wonderfully implausible, yet the best possible outcome "investors" can hope for.  
3. Money laundering operation. The most entertaining option, by far, particularly when one considers the liability of "investors" here.
FWIW, I hope folks get paid back, so that we can keep the mystery alive, and still entertain whether Pirate likes to throw money away, or whether investors are complicit in all sort of fun financial crimes.

For this to become any sort of fatal flaw, Bitcoin must become insanely widespread first.
That puts it in the "good problems to have" category.
The solution given makes little sense. A more likely scenario would be that once uBTC become too highly valued for ordinary business, alternate blockchains will spontaneously appear and fill-up the lower valuation space.
But this kind of forward planning requires a very generous amount of optimism. I for one would be delighted to see uBTCs becoming prohibitively expensive, but I would not recommend holding one's breath waiting for it to happen.

I'm confused about the argument that Big Government  handling education results in X bad things, but Smaller Big Government  doing the exact same thing will somehow avoid all of those bad things.
The competition arguments sounds a bit like claiming the US school system is under pressure to improve because Canada makes us look bad. If that doesn't seem to be true, how would Oklahoma feel pressured by Dakota's educational achievements?
Maybe state-run schools isn't the end goal though. Maybe what we really want are county-run schools, or city-run schools. Let every mayor try their own awesome educational policies on whatever budget their constituents can scramble. I could understand that argument better, although the flaws there become very obvious.

It's their long term plan. If the four parts of that plan were "wait for Bitcoin to take over the world, because it's already perfect" repeated 4 times, I imagine it'd make a lot of people happy here, but that'd be a notable kind of focused, wishy thinking as well.
So instead, they're going with hand waving, based on what they see today. Is that what things will look like 10 years from now? Probably not. But meanwhile a lot of folks are throwing a lot of things at the wall, and some of those will probably stick.
Turing complete-ish smart contract platforms are not going away. They'll have bug, they'll mature, and they'll evolve into something powerful enough to run complex dapps. Meanwhile, Bitcoin will stay the course because it's already perfect.  
And yet even that's okay, since Bitcoin will eventually actually sprout a usable sidechain mechanism (c'mon Blockstream, c'mon), so if anything like Ethereum ends up being useful, it'll be possible to use Bitcoin with it.
The "web browser equivalent" bit could refer to a few things. Brave has a some kind of [bitcoin wallet integration]( Ethereum has a [metamask]( browser extension that exposes the Ethereum API to arbitrary web pages (which is of course [a fantastic idea]( from a security standpoint.) And then there are the ["web payment" standardization efforts]( which may someday produce something useful in this area, although I'd much rather see a few efforts like metamask happening and later ask the survivors what worked and what didn't rather than writing a "standard" document in a vacuum.

Given that the legacy payment systems have the concept of chargeback baked in deeply, at best Paxum can pretend that chargebacks don't happen and spread their costs over their entire customer base through higher fees. To truly not have chargebacks, they'd need to not be part of the legacy systems.


Careful about what "they" points to. Paxum may be full of sunshine and good intentions, but this was forced onto them by Mastercard, and I haven't seen a statement from Mastercard explaining how comfortable they feel about Bitcoin's legality or its risk profile in general.


No clue, and yet I would be astounded if my two bullet items constituted the entire gamut of [possible risks]( a payment system would face when integrating with an unconventional payment system.
At this point, I have to wonder what purpose there is in arguing about my speculation.
If you are somehow 100% sure that none of my pedestrian hypotheses are possible in any way, then Occam's Razor finds itself beaten by Sherlock Holmes' "whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth", and this is part of a vast conspiracy to shut Bitcoin down.
Is that what you are ultimately pointing at?

I'm not sure, to be honest. After asking those questions, I bumped into [this forum]( which lists a number of offers that promise no less than 50% returns a year, and usually quite a bit more.
It seems like the vast majority of them are not seen by the community as obvious scams, and the fact that "fund managers" could most likely raise money on their own at a fraction of the cost they purport to pay in interests doesn't seem to bother many.
I guess that observation is consistent with the answers I'm getting here, puzzling as it all seems to me.

I wish people would stop writing shit like


If it goes this high, it's almost guarantee it will crash down again, instead of keeping the optimal slow steady growth profile it should have.
If you like crazy oscillations because you think you'll be able to time the market because of them, that's the kind of BS you want spread.  
If on the other hand you want bitcoin to be a steady, stable, predictable currency, then chill the rethoric a bit. Bitcoin value should be a function of its use and its circulation. Anything that props it beyond what those two factors naturally bear is bound to result in a crash down the road.
Actually, it'd be interesting if someone could map an "ideal" bitcoin value, both based on the historical data, and on current data. It'd require estimating the amount and value of legitimate bitcoin transactions, as well as estimating a spot volume of liquid bitcoins at a given time. Not sure how accurate that could be.
It used to be easy very early on.. Bitcoins passed around: ~12,000. Goods purchased: 1 pizza (worth roughly $10). Value of 1 bitcoin =~ $0.00083
It's a bit harder now. Still, if an estimate of some quality could be made, and shown to the bitcoin world, it might help chill down some of the market's exuberance.

I like the way you think.
But seriously, inaction is merely delaying the maturing of the ecosystem. After a few more obvious scams, even the most determined "investors" will pause when seeing yet another "high-yield" offer, at which points scammers will need to start being less obvious, eventually taking us to the same spot a bit of heavy-handed paternalistic moderation would have.
The other counterpoint that comes to mind is that thanks to pirate and others, there's a fair amount of blood in the water now. The bitcoin community is going to be (ok, is) known to be a pool of endless gullibility, easily reachable through loosely-moderated forums. All sharks have to do is put in a few months, hang around, build a "reputation", do a few trades, then offer your shiny mad investment vehicle, and cash out in a blaze of infamy, with literally nobody to stop them at any point of the process (cassandras in the wilderness don't count.)
Given that the pool keeps growing as Bitcoin becomes more popular, this isn't going to go away on its own soon.

The service was widely used and promoted on the forums, a pillar of the bitcoin community promoted it on his show.

I sorta wish all of this was true. Bitcoin being perceived as a threat to the Iran embargo, the us government acting quickly to force SF.net to block Iran ips, SF itself feeling forced to add some explanations on their blog about it.
I doubt pretty much all of it though. The only objective fact we have here its that SF.net brought itself in compliance with existing us export rules.
But take it from the top. If this isn't wishful thinking, where is the Iranian interest in bitcoin? It's not particularly hard for a non us individual to rehost bitcoin software on a non us server. Has that been necessary to satisfy the sudden Iranian hunger for crypto-currencies?
what I've seen regarding Iran and bitcoin are a bunch of folks saying "hey Iranian folks should totally start using bitcoins. No I haven't thought about how they would acquire or use them one bit, but it's probably still a great idea somehow."

Turing complete contracts are a really big gun and it's certainly easy to aim them at one's own foot, but maybe they can be aimed at other things too. In that regard, maybe all the work happening toward the formal verification of complex contracts will end up being useful.
Do we need something more powerful than what was there before? I suspect the answer is always going to be yes, no matter how many sport cars get wrapped around trees.  
Check out  and the last example in particular: A lottery smart contract. "Very advanced scripting", with serious research paper linked, etc.  
And yet this is basically the "hello world" of ethereum contracts. Here, the first thing someone discovering smart contracts tries to write is a little lottery/ponzi/whatever contract that'll redistribute some balance between participants according to some rules. Some of those contracts even work as intended, depending on how much the novice contract writer understood things before jumping in!  (Turns out unpredictable random number generation in a smart contract is a fun problem.)
But that's my point: The most complex Bitcoin smart contracts, best left to experts, are trivial to write by any Ethereum beginner. Now maybe that's where it ends, and expert smart contracts writers won't ever think of something useful to do with Ethereum that was simply out of Bitcoin's reach. But maybe not.

I can imagine legal cases about pirateat40 or glbse, or a great many other Bitcoin-based operations, but none of those cases would be about Bitcoin itself, merely about actions taken that might have been breaking various laws regardless of the underlying currencies/commodities used.
The only things I can imagine that might qualify would be actions going after the core dev team, and even those would be unlikely to be true tests of Bitcoin's legality.

That means double spend attacks can only be done successfully by waiting for the reply transaction, and firing the double spend if it's a losing bet, making the attack a lot less likely to win the race, but not necessarily impossible.
As the paper mentioned, controlling the topology of the network is key to improving the odds. The attacker is going to want direct connections to miner hosts as well as to the target node. That's relatively easy to do, but may not improve odds sufficiently here.
However, if it ever became possible to detect what bitcoin nodes a bitcoin client is connected to, and one were able to neutralize those nodes, the target node could become temporarily isolated, save for the attacker himself. That would open a window to send transactions that could be safely double spent if necessary.
A naive approach to such detection might involve firing probe transactions to every known host and timing them (assuming it is possible to connect to any bitcoin host at any time for the purpose of sending a few random transactions.) Everything else being equal, one would expect to see lower latencies for nodes that are closest to the target node.
There might be better ways to map the bitcoin network topology.

Somewhat. I applied to raise my withdrawal limit on coinbase once. Since they let me pick the new limit, I picked a million dollars of course. 
They ended up raising it a wee bit from $10K, but still very far from my ask.
So that's nice, and it's probably enough if I'm screwing around with altcoins.
But for larger things, should I ever need to, I think I'll simply use an exchange without those kind of limits. Assuming there are still some at that time.

It's really not a stupid question. I wish more people would ask it for themselves, if anything.
The answer varies greatly from one exchange to the next.
If you use one of the more legitimate US-based exchanges (like Coinbase and Gemini), your USD balance is FDIC-insured up to $250k, like a typical bank account. 
Insurance on digital assets like Bitcoin and such, is apparently a thing. [Coinbase claims to have some]( for example. It's always tricky to estimate how meaningful those insurances are until they actually need to come into play.
One such instance occurred relatively recently with BitFinex, who had claimed to have all its bitcoin insured through BitGo, right up until they lost around 120000 bitcoins. Soon after, it turned out that [they really had no insurance coverage for the loss]( and BitFinex customers learned they would have to take a 36% haircut on their balances instead. Oops.
Given how green and immature the crypto exchange environment is, I'd recommend you stick to the more legitimate exchanges that offer FDIC insurance at least. Digital asset insurance is still an unknown at this point, and we've yet to see an instance where an exchange loses their bitcoin, and an insurance makes their customers whole again. 
Unfortunately, if you want to [trade some shitcoins]( you'll often need to use exchanges that are more on the wild side, often in far remote locales, and where sometimes you have no idea who actually owns them.  
Given the [kind of people](/# "degenerate gamblers") that are attracted to altcoin trading, that's merely just another fun risk to throw on the pile to them.
But assuming you're not into kinky stuff and stick to the basics for now, your main concerns aren't going to be the exchanges' insurance policy, but instead:  
- The security of your account on the exchange. You're responsible for the passwords. If you don't setup 2FA and get hacked, the exchange will literally laugh at you when you ask for your money back. If you setup 2FA and get hacked, they still won't give you your money back, but they'll act surprised and will thoughtfully raise one eyebrow while telling you this is very odd yet there's nothing they can do. Setup 2FA, but understand that if an attacker knows you have some bitcoin, it's unfortunately surprisingly easy to call your cell phone provider, reassign your phone number to them and bypass many 2FA systems.  
- their customer service, or lack thereof. For some reason, exchanges, even the more legitimate ones, have woefully inadequate staffing for their customer service department. Everything will be great as long as you don't ever need to contact them about anything.
My own approach through this mess is to:  
- stick to "reputable" exchanges (which doesn't include BTC-E despite their impressive cockroach-like resiliency to adverse events)  
- use exchanges as little as I have to (I have no value on any exchange at the moment, and that's almost always true. When it's not true, it's because I'm actively making a trade. That's it. But that requires planning for appropriate deposit/withdrawal/trading limits beforehand, and that can be a slow process.)  
- not ever tell people I have bitcoin. nobody needs to know that stuff.

*2011. The first whispers of a crazy bitcoin bubble started soon after it became as valuable as a dollar, when it experienced its first dramatic crash to 75 cents.  
The widespread consensus was that it was ridiculous that a virtual currency would ever be worth as much as a mighty dollar, and was therefore completely unsustainable.
On the other hand, it's useful to remember that perpetual exponential growth in a finite environment is a physical impossibility. Keep that in mind you're told to make plans for retirement that assume you'll get 6%+ returns on your capital indefinitely. It's also applicable when projecting ever higher market values for bitcoin.  
At some point, exponential growth must bump into practical limits, by definition.

It sounds a little bit relevant, yes. One of the biggest challenge for newcomers is that you're expected to secure your own systems if they're going to touch anything Bitcoin related. You're going to want to practice better computer hygiene than that if you intend to stick around.
But in your case, I'm not sure this has anything to do with Bitcoin.  
If you had malware on your computer (which nowadays often means either keylogger or ransomware, and if it was the latter, you'd have noticed), and you typed sensitive information on that computer, like your bank account and routing information, or maybe your debit card, the bad people got to it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:11:04


I don't know. If the keylogger theory is correct, you should assume everything you typed on your computer since that malware was there is compromised. That includes all your web logins and passwords, and any sensitive information you may have entered at any point (such as bank accounts, etc, but also more. For example, do you file your taxes online?)
So at the very least, change all the passwords that may have been impacted. Any site that keeps you logged in will need a password change, even if you didn't type it during the compromised period. Also, everything in your keychain should be treated as compromised as well, including certificates used to access VPNs or other servers.
Beyond that, I don't know. Maybe you got lucky and the scanner really did remove all traces of [a relatively naive malware]( But maybe you were super unlucky, and you ended up with a variant that installed a [rootkit in your firmware that can survive a full OS reinstall]( Or anything in between, really.
For the short term, do all your password/certificate change operations from a computer you can trust, until you figure out what to do with this one.

You're allowed to speculate all you want. That's really the point of Bitcoin isn't it? Not the ridiculous price action, but that nobody gets to tell you what to do with it. You can dismiss everything people are writing here, and do whatever you want, and that's completely fine. Really.
Here's a few things to consider:
You don't know what Bitcoin is going to do next. I don't know what Bitcoin is going to do next. Nobody else does either. We may hope for things to go a certain way. We may have found all kind of reasons to justify that hope. That's not the same as knowing. There's no sure thing here.  
You may have gotten used to folks telling you that investing in the S&amp;P500 is guaranteed to return 7% yearly. It's bullshit, obviously, but it's plausible bullshit, and almost everyone believes it. There are almost a hundred years of historical records to back that claim, and 7% doesn't seem all that crazy anyway, particularly when you don't understand the difference between annual returns and annualized returns. Entire financial industries depend on that rate being more or less true. 401K plans rely on it to pacify their workers into believing they'll be able to afford to retire one day.  
Bitcoin is at the polar opposite of that. You're guaranteed nothing. You can wish for 100x returns all you want, but nobody cares. The historical return over 7 years is probably close to 200% yearly, and it means nothing. If you rely on that number to count your chicken, you're going to have a bad time.  
Folks here often give the advice "don't invest more in bitcoin than you can afford to lose", not because they're all big jerks that want to stop you from getting rich, but because you really can lose it, and I'm not just talking about the crazy volatility and the 25% price drops that happen every other week. If you bought $10,000 worth of bitcoin on November 30, 2013, one year later you'd have had only $3,800 left. One year later, you'd still be at $3,800 and wondering how you could have made such a terrible investment decision. You should expect this will happen again, or worse.
The folks that "made millions" from getting into bitcoin a long long time ago had to sit through that, except with bigger numbers and bigger losses, and none of them knew for sure what the future would hold.  
So you're welcome to join the club if you think you've got what it takes. But if you expect it to be your easy ride to mad money, don't forget to buckle up. If nothing else, it'll be a valuable learning experience.

The internet is full of tough guys making grand standing principled statements about how they'd rather die than pay a single satoshi of their hard earned bitcoin to the IRS. "Give me 0% effective tax rate or give me death", I believe is their motto.
Those people generally fall into one of three categories:
1. People that actually researched this, and took drastic actions to do so (sometimes involving renouncing their citizenship, and worse.)   
2. People that simply assumed they were going to stay under the radar and that the IRS would never catch them even though they traded on exchanges that verified their full identity and kept detailed records.
3. People that act hard online, and then pay their taxes because they know that you don't fuck with the IRS.
At the end of the day, folks are making ludicrous returns here, and risking all of it to maybe save 20% in taxes is a pretty dumb move.

How many messages will at most be sent over a particular user's pipe? 1M * (1+bitcoin neighbors). For me right now, that'd be *9. Okay. Note that the bandwidth I consume on my side is only correlated to the number of transactions happening, not to the total number of users on the network.
So that doesn't sound quite as scary as your final verdict of unscalability, mostly because the load is fairly well distributed over the entire network.
Now to go back to your 1T figure, yes, that's about the total amount of data that the internet would need to carry as a whole. You could argue that ISPs might start to get nervous if this gets very popular. Or maybe it wouldn't even register as a blip compared to the large quantity of video-on-demand otherwise clogging the pipes. 
My point is, how sure are you that the available bandwidth is not [growing fast enough]( to accommodate bitcoin's growth and then some?

It's in the "extra flags" input field, I think.
I run mine from the command line, with the flags:  
    -w 128 -v -f 60 -a 10 
The -w and -v stuff are basically just speed tweaks that maximize throughput for my particular config, and might not be optimal elsewhere. ( The -a is an attempt at balancing me hammering slush's server vs minimizing stale results and redundant computations.)
The -f 60 sets it to 60 fps. The default is apparently 30, which squeezes a bit more hash rates out of the GPU, but at the cost of some desktop responsiveness. If it's bad enough to not make you want to run the miner, it's worth tweaking.

Sure. I started mining on January 5th 2011, and I have mined about 350 bitcoins so far.
If you divide one by the other, you'd get the idea that I'm mining an average of 4.5 BTC a day, when the truth is that I'm currently mining barely more than 1 BTC a day. I was getting about 10 BTC a day when I started, though.
That's with an ATI 5770 that mines at around 155,000 khash/s (unless an H264 video is playing in a Flash player instance, which halves my GPU clock speed and hash rate. grumble.)
I'm using Slush's mining pool ( ) - It was the best pool available when I started, and I haven't had a reason to change since.
The miner I use is [m0mchil's python miner]( mostly because it's a tiny chunk of python, and I like to understand what I run whenever possible.

It's true now, but it might not be always true. The blockchain is designed to allow pruning of older nodes to keep it at a manageable size over time.
Once that starts to happen, bitcoin historians will need to keep copies of the historical blockchain.
@_date: 2011-05-01 17:42:24
I'm mining 24/7 with slush's pool with a 5770, getting 160 Mhash/s peak, and I'm still getting a bit over 1 BTC a day.
I believe that pool is designed to reward miners that keep mining over long periods of time, rather than people that keep connecting/disconnecting to the pool, so your usage pattern might not be ideal.
Are you sure you can't mine all the time? With the mining framerate set to 60fps, I essentially can't tell if it's running or not. The only exception I've found is that some games will flat out crash at specific points if the miner is running.
I usually keep my mining console on a secondary screen, so I can see how much GPU other programs are actually using. Portal 2 apparently likes to use almost all of it, for example, while a full screen Netflix playback eats about 10% of it.

As long as I keep them as bitcoins, mostly nobody. It's when I convert them into USD that it gets interesting. 
Will the exchanger keep track of its transactions and report them to the IRS?  
Will it instead keep track of them yet not report them to the IRS, until they get raided down the line?  
Will it permanently destroy all records of those transactions as they happen?
Unless I'm sure it's the latter, I can be reasonably confident that the IRS will know about it eventually.
From my standpoint, I don't have any strong ideological reasons to avoid paying taxes in the first place. One potential problem however is that I'm not sure which rule would apply. A first guesstimate would be to go with capital gains, similar to profits on stock sales. But forex transactions actually get significantly better tax rates, so using those rules would be better, but it's not obvious that they'd apply.
So yeah.. That's one reason to hope BTC doesn't go to high, so that I don't have to actually figure all this stuff out.

no, I think it will, eventually.
As long as the only thing one can do with a currency is guess what it's worth and trade it for another, there's little reason for it to stabilize.
As more people keep offering new services and products for bitcoin however, each of the price points associated with them helps to stabilize the currency a little bit.
It shouldn't be that hard for new services to pop-up either. With a deflationary currency, merchants take relatively little risk in regard to currency fluctuation.

I had the same reaction ( and the "send to IP" feature of bitcoin needs to die, imho. )
There are issues though.
For one, it requires the name-resolving service to be no less secure and no less trustworthy than the bitcoin system itself. Would DNSSec fit the bill? Who controls DNSSec anyhow?
For another, it's often very useful to be able to generate a different bitcoin address for different payers to use. For a business, it's pretty much the only know to tell one bill being paid from another with the same amount. Having to attach a static bitcoin address to bitcoin://buymystuff.com/ makes that impossible.
But that doesn't change the fact that bitcoin as it stands now is relatively unfriendly to use for non-geeks. If that doesn't improve before it reaches critical mass, it's going to provide a fertile ground for 3d parties like bitcoinmail.com and others to fill in the usability gap.

That's the part I'm the most curious in seeing play out, tbh.
I wouldn't be too quick to dismiss the power of governments and central banks when it comes to money. It is, and has been, their turf for quite a while now, and I somehow doubt they're eager to see any kind of serious competition.
My best guess so far is that they'll ignore this as long as it doesn't reach critical mass. What happens afterward is fairly open, but it's unlikely to be a warm embrace of BTC into the interbank.

As others have said, don't mine with your CPUs. it doesn't matter how awesome they are and how many you have, it just won't compare to what an half-decent GPU can do. My ATI 5770 still gives me a bit over 1 BTC a day with its 155000 khash/s rate.
The card in your mac pro is probably at least as good as that, so in your shoes, I'd grab a GPU miner. I use [m0mchil's python miner]( and I know it can work on os X, provided you're willing to work out and install the dependencies. I haven't looked at miners in a few months, so it's possible for a simpler path to GPU mining on os X to exist.
As for your other boxen.. mac laptop's GPU cards tend to suck at crunching numbers, but it'd still be a bit better than straight out CPU mining. I haven't tested a PC-based laptop, but I'd expect similar results.
One good thing to note about GPU-mining is that, if configured reasonably, you should almost never notice any performance degradation (GPU-intensive applications and games being the exception). desktop compositing, browser rendering and video watching will all continue to work just fine. CPU miners aren't quite as nice in that regard.

I just stared at [the source]( a bit.
The wallet is not encrypted. The cloud backup is not encrypted. To put that in perspective, this is [what Google has to say about its cloud backup](


Now, the app author could make a fair case that encryption should happen in the bitcoinJ layer rather than in his app code itself, keeping the wallet encrypted at all time both locally and on the cloud, and requiring a pin to unlock it long enough to perform a "send" transaction.
Still, it would be nice to make the above state of things very clear to prospective users.

The biggest problem I have with this is that you need to have a lot of trust in the issuing authority (bitbills.com) 
Specifically the part where they claim not to keep a copy of every private key generated in a master "fuck you" file.
If this service takes off, and bitbills become widespread, such a master file would effectively give them control over the value of every bitbill in circulation.
The thing is, you won't have any warning that they kept the private keys all along, until the day comes where they decide to cash out all at once, running through every private key and taking any amount left from it, and are never heard of again. (too busy tanning on a tropical island.)
Of course, the guys behind bitbills.com are probably entirely honest folks that'd never do anything like that even if it could turn them into multi-millionaires. There's just not a very good way to be sure.

RSA dongles are still pretty awesome, even when RSA gets pwned, and you're still better off with them than without. 
Keep in mind the actual compromises involved keylogging people using RSA dongles to login, and watching enough logins to match the time and digit entered to the right seed, using information obtained by compromising RSA's internal network.
If anything, this shows 2-factor authentication may not be sufficient against government-funded hacking teams. It certainly doesn't make the case for sticking to password-only authentication.

I'm guessing OP might be asking out of concern for the safety of their bitcoin wallet, which has to be user-readable for the bitcoin client to be running.
With all this talk of wallet encryption to prevent loss, it's currently only useful if you mostly don't run the client.
That makes me wonder: If the private key parts of your wallet were encrypted, but not the list of addresses you own, would that allow an hypothetical bitcoin client to keep track of your account balance without having to decrypt the seekrit bits? Intuitively, I want to say yes, but I don't know the protocol enough to be sure.
If so, one could envision a bitcoin client that keeps the wallet encrypted at all times, and adds some extra UI elements when the user attempts to send funds, to decrypt the wallet long enough to make the transactions.

My primary concern here is avoiding another disastrous exchange death. 
An exchange dying should be a newsworthy event, but not a shattering event causing many to wonder if Bitcoin is dead. When the overwhelming quantities of trades happen on one exchange alone, then that exchange keeling over has much greater consequences than it should.
So this proposal solves this by removing the incentive for every trader to flock toward the biggest exchange, and gives exchanges an incentive to compete based on their offering, features, spreads, etc. instead. This should result in smaller exchanges having a greater chance to grow and prosper.
For every exchange except the big giant one, it's a good business model. Their incentive is that without a system like this, every exchange will fail (or at best stagnate with a tiny market share) except one, who will take all.
It's certainly more work to implement than to not implement it. It's a lot harder than putting a few sql-injectable php pages together. However I don't believe it's incredibly difficult to implement.
One thing I'll admit though is that while there is an initial incentive for smaller exchanges to want to link together to better compete, I don't see an obvious incentive for linked players to accept a newcomer. 
My default approach would be to have the over-seeing entity enforcing rules to accept newcomers that meet a few requirements, but that entity would have to remain completely independent, neutral, benevolent, and have a lot of user mindshare to be able to shame violating exchanges into compliance.
(And yes, that sounds a little bit like a governing/regulatory body of sort, without the teeth.)

The conversion rate of BTC should have relatively little weight on whether or not to use it.. When it reached dollar parity, folks said it was overpriced. Then it was the same outcry at $2, $5, $10, etc... Really, by that logic, bitcoin has been overpriced since the first day someone was willing to pay for some. There's nothing intrinsic in Bitcoin that makes it less or more overpriced at $0.01 than at $250.00.
The bigger question is what can you do with it. If the only practical possibility is to wait for the conversion rate to go up or down, then it's dubious.
Based on your update, there's not a lot to do with bitcoins in your neighborhood yet. That doesn't make them terribly useful yet. You being a local exchanger is an important step, but there needs to be some kind of practical use for them.
I'm not sure what the sales pitch would be, but you might be better off trying to convince local online services to accept bitcoins than to get local folks to acquire bitcoins for now.

That definitely shouldn't be happening. 
I get lag when I make my openCL miner target my CPU cores, but that's a bad idea anyway since it gets terrible hash rates.
When targeting the GPU cores, there's no noticeable CPU use, and the only visible effect is that the framerate of anything on the screen is limited to what I set it to. It can get pretty obvious if I try 15 or even 30 fps, but given that my LCD screens refresh at 60fps, setting the miner framerate at the same level keeps everything looking smooth.
Make sure your miner is not somehow using both your CPU and GPU cores at the same time. Otherwise, try a different miner. I'm happily using a variant of [poclbm]( myself.

Did anybody else smell a faint odor of bullshit when the introductory video claimed there was no middle man in those transactions?
Sure, no middle man, except that the issuer of the currency (which you *must* trust when they tell you their currency is backed by the dollar, and not occasionally generated from thin air) is also apparently the only entity that can make transfers happen between two parties. What's a middle man again?
I'm a little confused by their business model, if there's one. They seem to be trying pretty hard to avoid being hit with the usual money laundering charges that seem to inevitably befall every successful virtual currency, but I don't really see where they get to make money legitimately.
Speaking of which, I enjoyed reading their [Terms of service]( In particular, I recommend reading section 6 "*Termination, Closing Your profile, or Limited Profile Access*", and ponder what "*We may terminate this Agreement and close your Profile for any reason at any time upon notice to you.*" means to any wingcash "notes" you thought you "owned".
Beside these fun and interesting business aspects, I'd be curious to see any kind of technical paper explaining how the currency achieves its claims.
For example, is there a strong cryptographical mechanism that truly makes transactions irrevocable, or is the concept of "wingcash irrevocability" essentially just another business decision, enforced by wingcash.com's central position to every wingcash operation for exactly as long as they wish to enforce it? If the later, it's a rather weak form of irrevocability.

The author has a vested and disclosed interest in several of what he calls "permissioned, distributed legder systems."
The paper consistently attempts to make the case that bitcoin is inadequate and that Ripple and its 7 closest relatives are at the sweet spot between "the exiting commercial banking infrastructure" and bitcoin, taking all of bitcoin's strengths and none of its weaknesses.
Coming from a bitcoin mindset, you might assume that "permissioned, distributed legders" are perhaps decentralized. They are not. As defined by the paper, a permissioned system is one where the identify of every participant is controlled by a central entity.   
If you dig into the specifics of at least some of the 8 permissioned systems, you will find even stronger centralized constraints by design.
In that context, the meaning of "distributed" is orthogonal to "decentralized". In fact the paper's own definition of "distributed ledger", despite never saying what makes a ledger distributed, ends by disqualifying bitcoin itself from the concept.
So that paper is not about bitcoin. It uses bitcoin to try to make a case for systems that are thoroughly unlike bitcoin.  
More annoyingly, it repeatedly collides the term "distributed ledger" and "blockchain" as if the two were equivalent concepts when they are near antithetical.  
If you take the paper at face value, starting at page 21, you will learn that the blockchain is not a concept unique to bitcoin and not even tied to concepts of decentralization. Ripple has a blockchain. Hyperledger has a blockchain. I had a bit of a rough blockchain two hours after lunch today.  
The word becomes bastardized to the point of becoming literally meaningless. 
And perhaps that's the point. The author himself notes in the beginning of his paper:


Indeed. It's unfortunate that the rest of the paper eagerly tries to fulfill that request without making any attempt to define what a blockchain actually is and isn't.
*Edit: Looking at the endnotes, it becomes clear that while the author perpetuates an annoying confusion about what the blockchain is, he didn't start it. The term "Permissioned Blockchain" appears to originate from a presentation by someone at one of the 8 ["Blockchain Finance"]( and there's also [Soylent Blockchain]( which consists entirely of redefining the blockchain away from bitcoin, because picking a new word would have been too clear.

Out of all the Bitcoin Doomsday Scenarios (tm), this one is relatively mild.
Essentially it boils down to "what if another currency captures our early adopter crowd's imagination."
I think the real scary stuff starts when Bitcoin becomes successful. Successful enough to attract large number of the usual gambling and money laundering operations.
At that point, we'll start to see exactly how resilient Bitcoin is to organized attempts to shut it down by deep-pocketed entities.
Which reminds me, the *real* reason to mine is not to make a quick buck, but to increase the resiliency of Bitcoin to such attempts.

well, for one, the bitcoin client only does CPU-based mining. If you have video card that is less than 3/4 years old, that's a few order of magnitude slower than what you'd get with a GPU miner.
Another neat side of GPU mining is that it leaves your CPU idle, and is designed to yield to other GPU-using stuff politely, so you can keep it running 24/7 while watching videos/gaming/whatever and not have to care too much. (some games may seem choppier under some conditions. you can always stop mining during your gaming session.)
if you check the forums on bitcoin.org, there should be a bunch of threads about GPU mining, including links to various miners you can download.
Miners run side-by-side with the bitcoin client (or in the case of a mining pool (like [Slush's pool]( standalone but chatting with the pooling server very regularly)
If nothing else, playing with GPU mining helped me realize the insane computing power my so-called video card contains (my oldish ATI 5770 can do a solid single-precision TeraFLOPS, which kinda blows my mind. In bitcoin terms, it computes 160 Mhash/s, where each hash consists of almost 2 full SHA-256 runs so that's over 300 million SHA-256/s. So that's kinda cool, and it keeps doing the regular video stuff while computing all that.)
As an aside, I'm still mining with my little 5770 as part of a pool. at the beginning of the year, I was getting 8 BTC a day. nowadays, it's closer to 3 BTC a day. My GPU consumes 280 Watts, running 24/7, that's ~ 6.7 kWh. My power company charges $0.052/kWh, so that means my 3 BTC/day cost about $0.35. At current rates, it's still worth doing. Hell, I just realized I'm basically mining enough BTCs to cover my entire electric bills so far.
So that's my little take on the whole "mining ain't profitable" concept. I'm really not doing it for the money, it's just something fun to waste GPU cycles on.

The bitcoin mining hardware is optimized for embarrassingly parallel integer algorithms with minimal bandwidth requirements. Now, that doesn't mean it can't be used with floating points or with more memory intensive kernels, but it won't be quite as impressive.
I believe the "right" way to deploy such a service is to start as a traditional mining pool with opt-in for side jobs when jobs are available at a presumably higher return than the current average mining rate.
The base mining rate of the pool gives a computational baseline that can be promoted to sell GPU power for arbitrary jobs to external buyers.
People buying GPU power should not be forced to use bitcoins to do so. The pool owner should be responsible for converting incoming payments into *coins and distribute the proceeds to participants.
On the technical side, that requires a non-standard mining client (or more likely, a custom pool client that can pilot the usual mining clients, and) that can switch off the *coin mining and start a custom job. Such a job would consist of an openCL kernel, and a scripted wrapper for the kernel (python?). It would be desirable for the wrapper to be sandboxed in a way that enables storage and networking but doesn't give full local access to the mining rig. The mining pool servers would also need modules to allocate job slices and verify the work returned. (The verification bit is fairly critical, since we're playing for money here.)
That means the custom jobs would have to be written by someone familiar with OpenCL and distributed computing.
So the cost structure would have a fixed initial consulting+dev cost, possible update dev costs, plus some kind of per-GPU usage cost that is used to pay the miners. The job owner would be able to dynamically increase his bid to try and attract more GPUs to his job. Payment is always upfront, processing is done until the balance runs out.
The initial costs would mostly disappear if a customer wants a job that falls into a generic class of problems, i.e. "crack a pwd hash", "find a hash of a string starting with 0xDEADBEEF that also starts with 0xDEADBEEF", etc.
The bidding approach to jobs means that job providers initially compete against the bitcoin mining returns, but as (if) demand grows, they start competing against each others for a bigger share of the pool. The pricing structure should be engineered to ensure that smaller jobs won't be completely starved by larger ones, or newcomers may not be able to dip their toes in the pool.
It's all beautiful in my head. The question of course is how much of a market there really is for all this. 
Anyway, if someone's going to do this, just remember to keep the GPU clients cross-platform, and sandbox the openCL wrapper. Bonus points if they can guarantee that, regardless of the job being downloaded, the kernel will always yield the GPU often enough to meet a configurable target fps.
@_date: 2011-04-20 07:23:43
As others mentioned, you want to use your GPU to mine. If it has openCL (or CUDA) support , you can mine with it.
Be warned, "mobile" version of GPU cards are considerably less impressive than their desktop counterparts at crunching numbers. Still, it's going to be better than CPU mining (and it'll keep your computer more responsive while mining.)
For reference, my desktop has an ATI HD 5770, I crunch about 155,000 khash/s (half that when watching flash videos. curse you Adobe!) and I still grab roughly about 1 BTC a day with it.

That's not great advice.. I currently mine an average of 2 BTC a day with my mid-range ATI 5770 card, which is still above my electricity costs.
But more importantly, the more computing power is given to the bitcoin network, the more resilient it becomes to attacks.

The fraud-prevention stuff seems harder to enforce.. It's one thing to define a mechanism for inter-exchange and pressure exchanges to implement it. You can tell when they're doing it or not.
The confirmation block stuff wouldn't be public, so it would be hard to check.  
Well, unless exchanges start to implement each customer account as a separate bitcoin wallet. That'd require a patched bitcoin client to manage a large number of wallets concurrently and it would introduce a lot of chatter on the blockchain, but it could be an interesting trade-off given the additional accountability/transparency it would afford.

no, don't misunderstand what that thread is saying. Nobody's wagging their finger at you and telling you to not mine for bitcoins.
The only point they're making is that it's not going to make you quite as rich as you might think.
Beyond that pragmatic aspect however, mining bitcoin is a very Good Thing to do. You see, the difficulty factor mentioned in the thread doesn't just quantify how hard it is to mine new coins. It also quantifies how hard it is for someone to subvert the bitcoin protocol. So in a way, the higher the difficulty rises, the healthier bitcoin gets.

I halfheartedly disagree. Can you say you really own something when you need to keep paying for it every year?
In OP's case, he'll need to pay at least a thousand dollar a year every year until he sells it, or until it gets repossessed for not paying.
As to whether or not it's an investment, that depends a lot on where his house is. But even with flat property prices for many years, the current low interest rates, and widely predicted upcoming higher interest rates create an arbitrage opportunity, and a mortgage on a primary home is one of the easiest ways to make that play.
@_date: 2011-05-05 17:17:19
I hadn't thought of that, but that makes sense. The openCL code that computes the hashes uses relatively few variables, and no arrays, so the odds are pretty good they would all fit on the GPU core registers.
If that's the case, then the speed of your memory should have no impact on your hashrate.
I'm going to screw with MSI afterburner right now. I'll report results if I don't crash horribly. 
*edit: confirmed. Brought Memory clock down from 1200 to 900Mhz in 100Mhz increments. Hash rate stays exactly the same. I have no idea how much impact this has on temperature though. I'll keep my memory clock at 900mhz for a little while to see if it goes down from 90c significantly.
*edit2: No noticeable heat difference with the fan speed kept to "auto", which makes sense, I suppose. With fan speed at 100%, 1200Mhz memory clock takes it to 86c, while 900Mhz brings it to 83c. roughly.

If the August 1st deadline approaches and there's no obvious telltale sign that Segwit will overwhelmingly activate, then anyone that uses bitcoin (businesses, exchanges, and maybe even ordinary folks) will need to figure out for themselves how they want to proceed:
1. They are 100% sure that UASF will pass somehow. They only run process transactions from a UASF node, because they know everything is going to work out. Great.
2. They are 100% sure that UASF will fail somehow. Then only run process transactions from a non-UASF node, because they know everything is going to work out. Great.
 
3. They don't know what's going to happen. They have two assume the two incompatible blockchains will exist for some amount of time, and no visibility into which is the "real" one. They therefore have to run two nodes instead of one, one for the UASF chain, one for the regular chain, and broadcast all their transactions twice. Receiving a transaction becomes problematic, unless the sender is also following the same double-node approach, in which case they'll need to confirm the same transaction has appeared on both chains before considering it as truly received.
That last option is the most painful. It's a bunch of extra system administration and configuration, coupled with "how the F is every little bitcoin business supposed to reconcile transactions across two blockchains" questions. And let's not forget extra-slow confirmation time. They'll need to wait for the slowest of the two blockchains. For example, if UASF gets 25% of the hash rate, bitcoin business will need to wait 40 minutes per confirmation. It doesn't matter that the other chain is confirming in 15 minutes average, they have to wait for both to make sure they're not losing money in the end.
So maybe it's easier to pick a side and hope you don't lose too much bitcoin over this.
I expect that various bitcoin businesses have "interesting" feelings about UASF and the choices it forces on them, assuming they've understood this is what's going to happen to them.

As long as electricity is free and mining equipment grows on tree, this makes complete sense.

Why would the chain not survive Day 1? It's designed to split Bitcoin, and I have full confidence it will accomplish exactly that. 
As far as timeline, you don't have to guess. BIP-148 will be active for about 75 days, after which the UASF chain will stop rejecting blocks that don't signal segwit, and we can reflect on what a good time was had by all.

I was wondering the same thing. I'm honestly not sure.  
Practically, you'd want a way to follow the original chain regardless of what BIP148 nodes are doing, and not be affected by reorgs from it.
Would simply running a bitcoin client that doesn't have any segwit awareness be sufficient? Probably not, since segwit is consensus-compatible.
The best approach I can imagine is to wait until a chain divergence occurs, and immediately checkpoint that into a client node. That ought to be sufficient to completely ignore UASF from here on.
There are probably better ways to do this I don't know about.

It's not clear that there's a good path for wallets, exchanges or business that accept bitcoin to take here.
BIP-148 ignores replay attacks and promotes blockchain reorganization risks as a feature rather than a bug.
That leaves everybody in an awkward position. They have exactly two months to figure out, design, write, test and deploy a sane yet complex mechanisms to manage a split blockchain in a way that enables them to continue sending and processing transactions without risking the wallets they manage. Oh, and it may all be for nothing.
Given that, except a lot of "path of least resistance" strategies to take place.

Unless society as a whole decides to live in a world without leverage, there's going to be a need for lending. Bitcoin mortgages, bitcoin credit cards, bitcoin business loans.

As a filthy statist who has very little to gain if Ethereum takes off or not, I support both bitcoin and ethereum.
It's fairly obvious Bitcoin isn't in the business of trying new daring and dangerous innovations at this stage of the game. So we can all become old fogies protecting the status quo for the sake of changing the world, or we can support and encourage crazy offshoots of bitcoin and see which ones die or thrive.
The desire to see Bitcoin succeed should not eclipse the need for further innovations in this arena. Bitcoin is not the best cryptocurrency there will ever be, merely the first to succeed with some measure of scale. 
The theoretical existence of sidechains is an acknowledgement of that fact, and is perhaps the best the bitcoin community can offer to avoid being left behind on technical merits.  
I'm fine with that. I wish sidechains would actually be a real thing already, but sidechains themselves are a bit of a new daring and dangerous innovation, perhaps the last one bitcoin itself will ever see, so the lack of velocity there isn't entirely surprising.
So, sure, turn Ethereum into a sidechain if that's what it takes for you to accept it.
My hope there is that once they're real, it will help maximalists and other "winner takes all" folks look beyond that, and actually look at the technical merit of a stack rather than looking for reasons to dismiss it to preserve the safety of bitcoin's first mover advantage at all cost.
And on that day, perhaps Ethereum won't be considered "incredibly architecturally misguided" anymore (it might help drive the point home if someone wrote a toy language that emulated bitcoin scripts over ethereum. And then implemented some of the new op codes bitcoin is thinking about sprouting), since its technical capabilities will not be seen as a threat to bitcoin anymore.

scalability, maybe. insularity, yes. but I don't see the gain in flexibility. Ethereum's capabilities are a strict superset of what a verification-based scripting system can do.  
I'm intrigued by the idea that computations done outside of the blockchain could compete meaningfully with something like ethereum's capabilities.
I'm aware of various effort to "store" large amounts of data in the blockchain by storing hashes and hoping the actual source data remains available for lookup elsewhere.  
That approaches "works" because hashes are a reasonable way to prove the existence of a document in a way that's probably difficult to falsify.
I don't see a similarly widely applicable approach to verifying the results of computations as part of a transaction.   
The closest concept that comes to mind would be to use trusted computation oracles, but "trusted" is a dirty and somewhat self-defeating word in the context of blockchain operations.
Am I missing something here, or is the argument really a call to give up on trustless computation capabilities tied to a blockchain?
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:11:25
Because it's hard to decentralize, I think. Maybe something with a bunch of risk-measuring oracles feeding trust scores and risk scores into smart contracts that can then mediate loans?
It's not trivial to build a sane system that way, and if you let individuals decide which complete stranger is trustworthy, they'll end up doing dumb things, and bad people will end up running away with their money.
That doesn't mean it's impossible to do, but it's going to be easier to have centralized middle men doing that stuff for us. Same idea with currency exchanges. There are a few concepts of decentralized exchanges out there, and maybe someday they'll be what everyone uses, but so far central exchanges are a lot easier to use.

Greg's comment certainly seems like a strong opinion against any kind of turing complete blockchain. I don't see another way to read it.
I'm not sure what to say about claims that Ethereum is inefficient, when Bitcoin itself is a ground-breaking pioneer in inefficient databasing and networking. It's true, Ethereum is inefficient as hell, although I'm not sure you can do much better without losing one of its fundamental properties.
I wasn't entirely kidding when I mentioned having new languages targeting Ethereum that are less risky in some way, either because they dramatically reduce functionality (a la Bitcoin), or because they enforce additional rules, lose turing-completeness, etc.
Going somewhat in that direction, the guy that created Solidity is experimenting with having some formal verification on various bits of the language:   
I'm not sure it's possible to follow that thought to the entirety of the Solidity spec, but the subset to which it could apply may still be useful for a number of use cases.

It's easier to have a non-turing complete language on top of a turing complete VM than the other way around.
With the recent DAO happy fun times, maybe we'll see folks coming up with some interesting new languages that will make it easier to design a smart contract with some confidence that it won't explode down the line. Because the underlying EVM is rather open-ended, it's very possible Ethereum itself won't need to sprout new features for that to happen.

Well, if I mischaracterized it, then I'm a bastard propagandist from hell. However, If it's a factual description of its mechanism, enjoy your cognitive dissonance.  
FWIW, I wasn't mentioning it to take potshots at it, but because it's directly related to your question. See below.


I'll try, but my ideas on this aren't fully baked. The reason I mentioned the stuff above is because the same defense strategy is very roughly applicable to both attacks. In both cases, you have to deal with a rogue chain unexpectedly becoming the longer one, causing what were thought to be confirmed transactions to retroactively disappear from the record. In the smaller case, you know when the split is coming, so you can checkpoint right after (or if you're a clever goose, you write a patch that uses the same logic to detect the split as it happens and invalidate the first block that would only show on the split chain, so you don't have to be near a keyboard at the announced split time.)  
But in the broader sneaky 51% attack case, you don't get a warning. You don't get to see how they modified their nodes, and you can't simply write its logical inverse to skip over it.  
And so philosophical compromises must be made. The first attack will always be unexpected and always temporarily succeed. That can't really be helped. It can however be reversed. If node owners and developers react quickly, they can checkpoint the orphaned chain and re-establish it as the One True chain. But that's manual. Slow. Reactive.  
After the first few times of that happening, you'll start to see code appearing that automates the process. Effectively, we'll end up with a designated trusted authority that will broadcast "correct" checkpoints, and nodes that which to use them will be able to be configured to use that feed automatically.  
Great. Problem solved? Kinda. If you go about this naively, you would end up with One Guy that manages the feed (let's call him Craig, to annoy everyone) that has to somehow detect attacks and keep publishing checkpoints to keep Bitcoin on the Right Path.  
Craig is now a huge central weakness in the bitcoin ecosystem, and any organization big enough to successfully mount a 51% attack can certainly afford to apply some [rubber hose cryptanalysis]( on Craig.  
So in this pleasant fiction, Craig doesn't want to be the central figure of Bitcoin anymore. Instead, clever people design a system where people get to vote on what the next correct checkpoint should be. Hell, they could even write a smart contract on Ethereum to handle that vote and broadcast the majority result. Or whatever. It's not rocket surgery.  
While that could help save Craig's delicate features, we've really just piled on another consensus system on top of bitcoin, and our large pocketed attacker is getting really good at subverting consensus systems.  
Possible defenses here could include not letting just anybody participate, but instead only letting people vote for the checkpoints if they can, say, sign a message from a bitcoin address that has received an output before block X, where X is far enough in the past that it would predate the attacker's nefarious intentions. By restricting participation and picking a criteria likely to, if not entirely exclude the attacker, at least keep him robustly in the minority, you could perhaps hold the line a little bit longer.
So, as you see, the ideas here are not fully baked, and they introduce various ideological compromises that wouldn't make everybody in the community comfortable. But something with that general shape would be able to hold off a 51% attack and keep bitcoin superficially working correctly while this whole mess is going on. Up to a point.  
There are probably other, smarter things that could be done in this situation that I've completely missed too.
The real trouble is that since we're talking about an attacker that can literally piss away well over a billion dollars without blinking, they could do quite a bit more than just fucking with the bitcoin protocol, and it's a lot harder to defend against IRL attacks from that kind of entity.

They can, just like bitcoin miners can resist changes that Bitcoin Wizards want to implement.
The only meaningful difference so far is that the Ethereum community hasn't tried to bottle their malcontents.  
When they started working toward a DAO soft fork, then hard fork, they baked in options to let each and every one pick which side they wanted to be on. Folks who disagreed with the overall decision ended up on the ETC chain, and the folks left on the ETH side felt weird about it at first, but it seems like it was a rather good way to maintain a more cohesive community organically rather than oxymoronically trying to "force consensus" upon an upset minority.
In essence, that paints a clear roadmap for the next big changes that'll happen in Ethereum: Either there's truly consensus and everybody adopts the changes, or there'll be another minority fork and another little coin swirling in the wake of ETH.  
That's a fairly different style of governance from what Bitcoin is doing, but it seems funny to me to try to equate that system to a monarchy.

Speaking of regulations, my comment became visible after all! And just in time to jump into the heat of the discussion, too. Neat.
Competing open-source projects usually go do their own thing independently. In contrast here, everybody's fighting over one single shared resource, the bitcoin blockchain.  
Litecoin and Ethereum are competing open-source projects, while things like BIP148 and Segwit2x are attempts to change the rules of the bitcoin blockchain, more or less violently.
The end result is that instead of having mostly a spectator sport where Bitcoiners snicker at Ethereum when their DAO crashes in flames and Ethers cheer when their market returns dwarf Bitcoin's, we're having a contact sports where everybody tries to keep their hand on the same ball/blockchain, and is willing to shove everybody else out of the way to achieve that.

Because you are not considering the rest of Bitcoin's mechanics, the only reason you can conjure to explain why every man woman and child on earth is not mining bitcoins is that "it doesn't make the economy richer."  
In actuality, there's roughly as much mining power active at any point as the market will bear, ie as what people are willing to pay for the bitcoins produced by past and present mining efforts. If you track the market value of bitcoin on one line, and the entire cost of mining Bitcoin on another, you'll find that the two lines are highly correlated.
So. If we continue with your analogy to reflect this reality, there's a large and growing market of people willing to pay good money to see you burn your house. It doesn't matter what you think your house is worth, it's not that kind of subjectivity. A lot of people will pay you to burn it. And then to burn it down again. And again.  
And somehow, because of those throngs of seemingly insane people, you manage to eke a profit out of their obsessions with seeing your house burn. So maybe you get used to it. Monday? Time to burn the house. Tuesday? Time to burn the house.  
At that point, whose wealth is being destroyed exactly? You're making a profit out of your reckless and repeated acts of destruction. The greater market seems to want to pay you for it, and they think they're getting something of equal value out of it.
So.. Maybe the next question to think about would be: What value are people getting out of buying bitcoin, enough so that they're making people burning their own houses wealthier for doing it?

It's one of several mantras from the Doctrine of Bitcoin Maximalism.
Those "appcoins" don't run on top of bitcoin, therefore they're all terrible and useless.
By contrast, rare pepe cards traded on top of counterparty are great and wholesome because they exist on top of bitcon rather than beside it.

Those are some peculiar assumptions on which to build an argument.
Regarding `1)`, folks should do a quick paper simulation on what will happen with the author's various initial hashpower assumptions for BIP148 ("perhaps 10 percent, perhaps 1 percent, or perhaps even less").  
If you don't want to do the work, the tl;dr version is that miners that choose to mine of BIP148 will have a bad time for several months. The 2 weeks difficulty readjustment mechanism takes 5 months to happen at 10% hashpower, and over 4 years at 1%. Even then, things aren't all better, and miners will need a few more rounds of pain before they can start making the same kind of revenue as before.
Regarding `4)`, it's naive to assume the main chain users won't immediately checkpoint. This is literally the very first thing any sane person will do, to eliminate the risk of unwanted reorganization introduced by BIP148. The alternative is that there are folks out there that think "I don't care about BIP148, it might wipe out several months of transactions, but it's no big deal, I'll do nothing and wait it out."  
It's just not a thing.
Of course, once you suck that venom out of the gaping wound introduced by BIP148, you're left with an situation similar to the ETH vs ETC deal, where the losing chain can remain indefinitely, be it out of spite or principle.  
At that point, we don't need to apply some awesome game theory to predict behaviors, and maybe just watch what has happened in similar situations and learn from it.

Two questionable assumptions here:
1. The UASF coins will somehow have a higher market value than bitcoin.
2. The bitcoin nodes will not react to bip-148 and deploy their own patch to prevent an unwanted chain reorg caused by the 51% attack.

The basic fact is that client developers are only in the business of implementing options for nodes to use.
When some developers start to believe they are the True shepherds of Bitcoin, and must therefore maintain an iron grip upon it, things start to go awry as we've seen.
It's not a tenable situation, and things like BIP148, segwit2x, and hopefully many more choices to come are as many chinks in the iron curtain.
If a developer believes themselves to be in charge of Bitcoin's consensus, let them be fired from their illusions of being in charge.
If a developer works to try to improve Bitcoin for the rest of us, let them be.

The node count matters to the extent that if you're a main chain node, and trying to get blocks relayed to you from other nodes, but all the nodes you happened to connect to are UASF nodes, you're going to behave like a UASF node, at least until you meet a regular node, at which point you'll have to redo a lot of work to fix your state.
It sounds a little bit naive since it assumes node owners won't make any attempt to react to UASF, such as rejecting nodes that indicate through their uacomment string that they won't relay all bitcoin blocks, or maybe simply by marking one of the UASF split chain block as invalid.
But who knows.. Maybe the majority of bitcoin node owners have absolutely no idea what to do, in which case this simulation may reveal some insights.

Well.. margin trading is risky. margin trading crypto is riskier. letting a bot apply mechanical rules on a cryptocurrency margin account is even riskier.  
Even if it was an amazing bot (which we know nothing about btw), there should be days where the bot loses money. because that's how real trading works. you get your returns on average. not every trade is a winner. you're going to have bad days, bad weeks, and bad months.
So. They're lying to you about what they're doing with your money.
Then again, are they really?
Bitconnect got itself listed on a lot of [HYIP]( monitoring sites, such as:

It tells you something about the microcosm in which bitconnect exists. Browse around the site, if your ad blocker is tough enough to take it. Google "hyip", see what it's all about.
At a fundamental level, bitconnect lending claims are impossible. They claim to provide over 300% annual returns with no possible risk of loss. That just doesn't exist in the real world.  
The only way they can deliver on such a promise, daily no less, is by taking money from the "investments" they receive and using that to pay their "interests" daily.  
This is incidentally the reason why those "investments" are locked in for a few months.
So now you are locked into a race between the rate at which daily payouts deplete the coffers, and the rate at which new deposits arrive to fill them up.  
The moment the latter stops being ahead, expect payments to be "delayed", with a number of almost plausible reasons given, such as technical glitches, database corruptions, regulatory complications or maybe just hackers.
To spell it out, the only way you will profit from this is if you got in early enough, and you receive money stolen from others.
The moment you entered this scheme, you signed up to become either a victim or a thief.
This is made extra awkward by the fact that you publicized doing this on a YouTube video with your real identity tied to it.
I'd advise you to remove that video, but then again, if you'd rather be a thief than a victim, it would be in your interest to instead double down on providing bitconnect with as much publicity as possible, to ensure the scheme goes on long enough for you to come out on top.
As I see it, you've put yourself in an unfortunate situation.

nothing wrong with that method, but remember that the bitcoin ecosystem doesn't have to just lie down and take it.
for example, there's a plan by some parties to trigger a blockchain split roughly a month from now. not a big deal in itself, except this split is designed in a way that if the split chain ever becomes big enough, it will retroactively override and destroy the original chain. terrifying stuff?  
Kinda. Except you don't have to lie down and take it. For example, you can just checkpoint the original chain after the split and become immune to that particular attack.
the same idea applies to your scenario, except it's a bit more painful. it would become a game to tighten the consensus rules to constrain the damage a hostile 51% party can accomplish. you would also probably see the apparition of weird supplemental networks and rules to protect honest blocks from surprise re-orgs. Purists would be very upset that those warts are fundamentally undermining the decentralization of bitcoin, and they'd be right, but it could frustrate a 51% attacker for quite a while, during which other, perhaps more radical options could be calmly considered and eventually implemented.

I think there's a point of no return somewhere, and we may have passed it.
If bitcoin had been destroyed/outlawed/suppressed two years ago, it would have upset a few people, but overall nobody would have blinked. Just another failed open-source experiment.
Things are different once a big enough crowd has gotten used to the idea that bitcoin, or something like bitcoin, exists or can exist, and is useful. 
At that point, anything less than bitcoin's complete and utter destruction would merely amount to using a bit of antibiotics on a large bacteria population: It would just train survivors to deal with it better next time, and any short term decline would soon be completely offset.
"complete destruction" here would mean more than just killing bitcoin through some technical or legal means. It would also need to be so thoroughly discredited that no same person would ever want to get anywhere close to anything like it ever again.
It would probably require some collusion between many public and private interests to make it happen.  
Anything less sinister than that is unlikely to yield the desired result.

Rebalancing can make sense.
If you own bitcoins to hold, you may want to think of them as you would any other investments, and see where it fits in your diversification strategy.
If you're a crazy man, you're invested 100% in bitcoin, no problem. Don't ever sell, ride the dragon.
If you're slightly less crazy, you may have invested 50% in bitcoin, 50% in some high risk emerging international funds. Now, bitcoin suddenly jumps in value 100%, your portfolio is now 75% bitcoin, 25% intl funds.  
Unless you suddenly developed a much higher tolerance for risk, you're going to want to sell a third of your bitcoin portfolio and put the proceed in your international funds.
Of course, it's a weird mindset to adopt when you put very little money down in the first place. If you had 30% in a S&amp;P500 fund, 30% in international funds and 40% in small cap funds for example, it's a bit unsettling when your portfolio suddenly has 20% of bitcoin that just invited themselves in your net worth.
It's something you may want to think about though. Would you be okay with your bitcoin position becoming 80% of your portfolio, and if so, why are you holding on to your other investments right now?  
If not, then rebalancing is the only sane way to deal with this.

This "split protection" consists of reducing the necessary consensus from "near overwhelming" to "slightly higher than majority"
This would have seemed unacceptable not so long ago, but with bip148's "watch us laugh as we try to split the chain at 50.1%" policy, it seems downright reasonable by comparison.
Of course, it is not reasonable, and is just yet another signal that compromise must be avoided at all cost, and that driving Bitcoin straight of a cliff is vastly preferable.

That doesn't really bring my red flags down.
There seem to be a max limit builtin for each betting address, meaning that the owner controls exactly how much he can lose at any given probability.
If he hadn't chosen to raise money, he could have started with relatively low limits, and progressively raised them as more funds were available.
So apparently, he instead chose to buy some money at a premium to have higher limits available somewhat sooner.  
I can understand why you're not entirely convinced by that story.
Your speculation is a little more interesting, but rather sinister if true, since it doesn't just increase share value. The dividends paid are taken as a percentage of the profits. If some (or most) of the profits are fake, then the payouts are proportionally coming directly from the investor's money. There's a name for that kind of things, but it's been overused.
That you have personally invested in this is hopefully an indication that you don't believe your own speculation.

But your argument is leaky. There's nothing that the coinbase app did that the Wells Fargo Mobile app doesn't. Transfer money between account, use bill pay to send money out.. There are literally hundreds of similar apps on the app store.  
Did all those app get it right on the first try? It's safe to say some didn't. But they weren't shut out upfront, and were given the chance to fix whatever was bugging Apple.
Bitcoin apps get no such consideration. They get a blanket ban if they do anything more than show a chart and a ticker. 
Whatever "serious measures" you think need to be taken, I'll just note that making a home screen shortcut to coinbase.com exposes all the functionality of their forbidden app and more. I'd be curious to hear how that's a gaping security hole in Apple's armored blanket of consumer safety.

Last time, there was a good bout of desert crossing, where bitcoin stayed cheap for a while.  
Most folks weren't sure if it could recover.
Things feel fairly different this time though. There's still a lot of things in the process of being built for or around bitcoin. For better or for worse, some money bags have noticed bitcoins, and they aren't going to forget about it just yet.
Notice that I'm not saying that the current price is a predictor for anything. Look outside of the chart to see the bigger picture.
My best guess is that the cheap period is going to be shorter (which isn't saying much, beyond saying it's likely to take less than 6 months), and prices are likely to "recover" relatively quickly, by which I mean they'll probably be all over the map rather than just on the floor, but not that they'll necessarily climb right up to previous highs and beyond. 
Being "bullish" in bitcoin's environment is a bit like riding a bull at a rodeo. Wear some padding.

So, a few points to make:  
- bitcoin is now more popular than yolo on twitter     
- yet notice the "yolo" line is consistently flat. that's important, because it contrasts with the next point.  
- the "seo" line is interesting because it follows a strict weekly curve, with consistent downturn on the week-ends.  
- compare to the bitcoin curve, and you might just be able to start seeing hints of the same pattern developing, possibly indicating a transition from genuine enthusiasts that would be just as likely to tweet any day of the week, to a 9 to 5 crowd, which tweets during week days and clocks out on the week-end.

Something like that happened with namecoin, when it became more interesting to mine namecoins than bitcoins, which brought many miners briefly, and shot the difficulty through the roof. After the difficulty increase, miners went back to bitcoin, and namecoin was left with a large difficulty and very few miners. So blocks were taking a rather long time (hours, if I remember correctly) to get mined, and nothing could change that until enough blocks were mined to reach the next difficulty adjustment point.
The whole thing was a rather interesting view into unintended side effects of having multiple currencies competing for miner hashing power.

It's arbitrary, yet your final pricing is entirely dependent on that 1% being correct.
What if Bitcoin was used to do about $10 million worth of commercial transactions over the month of march?  
Given Bitpay's report of doing $2 million worth of transactions in March, it's likely to not be completely off by orders of magnitude.
Following the rest of your logic, 10 million dollars in to 10 million bitcoins, we can look forward to bitcoins reaching the sky high price of $1.
Now, at the risk of showing how green I am, I have truly no idea how dividing an overall transaction amount over a month by the bitcoin supply can yield a meaningful price indicator, so I'm putting roughly as much stock in my $1 number as in your $917 one.

The "if only 1% of" meme is a disease.

So.. doing some armchair estimations here, but given that the current hash rate of the network is about 30 TH/s, it would take 20 "BitForce Mini Rig SC" (or ~440 Avalon Asic  to flat out take over the bitcoin network. Either way, that's a cost of $600K.
Is it just me, or does that seem like a rather low cost to subvert or take over a financial network that transacts $8M daily and a currency that has a market cap of $300M?
Someone should make a pretty graph mapping the cost of subverting bitcoin vs the daily transaction volume over time.  
That'd be enlightening.
Anyway, right now, it takes a midsize government budget rounding error to take over bitcoin through purely technical means.  
Alternatively, enterprising individuals might be interested in controlling the network to impose a 1% flat fee on all transactions.  
$600K initial investment for a fixed percentage of every bitcoin transfers? It must be tempting, even with some expected transaction volume contraction.
As a bonus, once that happens, every miner out there stops making a single satoshi, removing any financial incentive to keep going and solidifying the take-over substantially, allowing the attackers to consolidate their position further by buying used and now useless mining rigs on the cheap. At the point, the only danger left for the attacker is another, bigger attacker. And by "attackers" I mean "de facto bitcoin overlords"

Right.. so there's some tension here. 
Bob finds a serious security hole in a system, that can impact users pretty seriously and embarrass the company responsible. He can:
1. exploit the hole, pwn the n00bs, and laugh on IRC about it.  
2. sell the exploit (to a security company if they'll have it, to the company itself if they're into being blackmailed, to evil h4x0rs otherwise), and laugh on IRC about it.  
3. notify the company of a problem, attempt to get something from them for it (money, employment, t-shirt, ...). See 2.  
4. notify the company with details, let them fix it. let users know about it.
Out of those, only 4. doesn't have fairly serious ethical problems.
A company notified of a security problem has no obligation to compensate the finder. Some companies have policies to pay some prize money. Other give t-shirts. Other give subscriptions to their premium services. Most give nothing, except at most some thanks.
If martianlife wanted to get back at them for not giving him something worth his while, ignoring the murky thought process involved, the best he could have done would have been to notify users as plainly as possible, explaining the impact, explaining the company's somewhat cavalier attitude about resolving it, and letting folks decide for themselves.
That'd be somewhat passive aggressive and dishonest as to his true intentions, but it would somehow make him come off as someone that cares about doing the right thing, rather than coming off as someone that wish he hadn't started doing the right thing.

You kinda just admitted that hashing the password doesn't buy anything.
Which is admitting a little bit too much, since a well meaning server could hand a challenge along with the login form and have some JS in there do something like hmac_sha2(challenge, password), which would at least prevent replays if the server isn't mishandling the challenge logic.
But even that is still vulnerable to mitm attacks, much more so than SSL itself, which means that if you are on a compromised computer (I'd put corp/school setups that break SSL or have keyloggers in that category), and folks in control want to capture your credentials, hashing isn't going to buy you much on top of SSL.
Just for fun, log into your online banking site while keeping the network tab of your browser's inspector open (or fiddler/charles/whatever). Your password is going to show right there in the SSL-sent form data. 
The load-balancer thing is interesting though. That's certainly an argument to not use amazon's ELB to handle SSL traffic to your super-secure login flows. Sites with dedicated hardware have at least some ability to control that a bit more tightly.

If it becomes more expensive to mine coins than they're worth *and* there's an alternative cryptocurrency that can be mined on the same hardware profitably, the difficulty will go down to reach profitable mining levels again. It might be a little slow on the way down. That pattern has already happened with at least one altcoin. If there isn't an alternative, I'd still expect the overall pattern to happen, but over a longer timeframe, as a percentage of miners reluctantly give up.


Refraining from making any long term prognostic, I feel fairly confident we'll see at least one much such exponential increase in the next 2 years (and probably another heart-stopping drop or two, to keep folks on their toes.)
That could be driven by speculation correlated to media coverage again, but hopefully it will have something to do with a market demand for a larger money supply caused by an increase in non-speculative uses of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-01 05:53:03
evilsquelch may be hopelessly misguided, but the statement "No amount of processing power will create tens of thousands of coins" isn't quite right. 
The lowest amount of bitcoin that meets that requirement is 20,000BTC. At current block yielding 25BTC, it would take mining 800 blocks to get to that figure.
Difficulty resets every two weeks, and next difficulty is going to assume about 36Thash/s to keep the 10m interval.
If the goal is to produce those tens of thousands of coins over the next difficulty period, the miner will have two weeks to mine 800 blocks. That means 1 out of every 3 block must be his.
So really, an amount of processing power that would create tens of thousands of coins^(over a carefully chosen two weeks period) is 18 Tera-hashes per second.
(Now, for fun, that's a bit less than 12 BitForce Mini Rig 'SC' can allegedly do, and that'd only cost 360,000 USD, assuming your landlord pays the utilities, or a bit over half of the expected 2 weeks return..)
*edit: math is hard.

The number of time anonymity is mentioned, and equated with criminal actions is fascinating, and as best as I can guess, a foreshadowing of FinCEN's handling of bitcoin, and related companies that "on the surface, engage in something that looks like what Liberty Reserve was doing."
 
My idle speculation here is that, in a FinCEN world, legal bitcoin transactions will only occur between bitcoin wallets that have been verified by KYC-complying exchangers, effectively splitting the bitcoin world between a black market and a white market, with the blockchain ledger allowing to hunt down any white market wallet dipping into the black side.

There's some evidence that MtGox had been trying to comply with US MSB requirements prior to the FinCEN "clarifications" of March 18, specifically by limiting money transfer amounts to avoid qualifying as an MSB:  ( apparently done by trying to comply with a previous FinCEN "clarification" from 2009:  )
This seizure warrant, the second against MtGox's bank accounts, puts down May 6 as the date at which the government observed MtGox had not complied with the new clarifications.  
So if we're optimistic, MtGox had 7 weeks from start to finish to turn its US LLC into a fully regulated MSB entity.
More realistically though, even that wouldn't have saved them. The seizure warrant documents evidence of MSB-like activity from 2011, and since the FinCEN document is meant to merely be a clarification of existing laws, those guidelines are applicable since the laws themselves were passed, which predate MtGox' existence.
So there's a reasonably case to be made that MtGox retroactively broke the law for two years at the very instant that FinCEN published its March 18 document.

Depends. If I'm an unconditional government apologist, I will always rationalize whatever is happening.
If I have slightly more nuanced opinions, I may well already be aware of the oncoming clash between cryptocurrencies and governments.
Ultimately, there's not a lot that is accomplished by playing Cassandra here, although it does entitle one to some smug sense of satisfaction whenever dire predictions come to pass.
My own take here is that we're on a race for legitimacy. The more credible use cases bitcoin finds, the harder it might be for various interests to shut it down/cripple it. But that presumes public outcry is still worth something.

Alright, let me put my tinfoil hat on for a second, and ask you this:
Given that most of the cost and difficulty of putting together an ASIC miner lies with the initial non-recurrent engineering steps, and given that there are working ASIC chips floating out there now, how confident can we really be that no one is getting their hands on large quantities of ASIC miners as we speak?
Put another way, if bitcoin ASIC company X was given a huge check to buy a large number of units at a premium with the promise of more sales in the future, what would be the odds of them agreeing to such a deal, versus honoring the pre-orders of anxious forum dwellers?
Heck, it could even explain all those mysterious and unforeseen delays.
Or none of that could be happening yet. 
Even then, the obvious goal of those ASIC companies is to sell as many of those things as they can while they can. If someone wants to buy a lot of their stuff, they will try their hardest to make it happen.
