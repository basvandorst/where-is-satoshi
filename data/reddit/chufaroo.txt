irrelevant analysis (other than CME may impact btc vol).. 
The stock market and a currency market are two different animals. In 1987, market was overvalued by 15-20% by most valuation metrics. The crash returned it to its fair value. 
Long-term btc price will be determined by value as a currency (usage due to cost-savings, protection from fiat inflation/devaluation, privacy, security) plus value place by network on its "store of value" properties (very hard to determine right now). A stock market, in the long-run ALWAYS follows valuation. Btc is a different beast.

and there's much more.
1) Most areas of the world experience serious inflation (3-5+ years of 10+% infl) fairly often, which can wipe out half of its real value. This happened in the US in the 1980s, but much more frequently everywhere else. The risk of 30-60% currency devaluation is huge too. It's because politicians spend money they don't have to curry favor from voters. It's happened a zillion times.. but owners of fiat get screwed.
2) Big banks make $2-$6bn every year on ATM and overdraft fees. Bitcoin ends that.
3) Visa fees are 1.5-3% per year on all transactions. Bitcoin, when Layer2 is ready, eliminates that middleman.
4) Because of its fixed supply, Bitcoin is likely to appreciate in value with the economy (same  for increasing amount of commerce), rather than depreciate in real value like fiat.
5) With next-gen security (fingerprint/retina scans, etc.), there's really no need for a bank at all. At some point, wallets will probably offer dirt cheap insurance (like 0.25% per year, equivalent of FDIC insurance) to protect against bizarre freak events like if someone kidnaps you and uses your retina scan to steal money. Other than that, there's really no need for a bank at all.
