That is an excellent analysis. I look forward to either buying more or selling half!
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:12:47
I got directed here from bitcoin reddit. should I panic now? or buy more instead?
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:30:33
When is bitcoin going to hit 3K? Possible? Anyone?
@_date: 2019-11-26 02:19:35
Nope. Just waiting closely whether it breaks the major support at 6500. if it does, it's going to be very cheap!
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:34:31
When moon? I got some really huge bag to unload soon :D
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:31:20
who owns most bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:14:34
lol by "panic" do  you mean buy more? or sell more?
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:33:45
I'll probably buy about 1 bitcoin but I decided to buy only if it breaks 8K resistance tho
@_date: 2019-11-28 03:00:44
How about your crystal ball eh?
@_date: 2019-11-28 03:01:10
Yes and yet they still keep buying em like candy poppers eh
@_date: 2019-11-28 03:06:09
correct! bitcoin looks like a long term investment but don't forget to swing trade
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:53:54
but it's really interesting how a price is achieved, i mean totally agree there are so many players and it's so hard to predict where the price is going but I always felt that it is the result of either fear or greed
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:22:06
well that makes sense
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:31:50
anti-malwares scan on! careful what you wished for
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:43:47
why so?
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:10:23
so price is really controlled by force. but sometimes I feel emotion plays a big big role
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:54:33
Interesting fact you have there!
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:30:56
well for the last time I've been hearing bad news and crashed but this time it's a good one.
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:51:50
I find greed to be the worst emotion. I always regret what I did few years ago
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:50:28
by force i mean gravity
