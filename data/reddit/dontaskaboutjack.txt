Yeah, I mean, this is an interesting question, I'm not knowledgeable enough to answer, but I suspect its not. 
1) Its a new idea, and its really great, and along the lines of security there seem to be arguably better competitors, but nothing that I'd switch for at this point. Someone else needs to step in to comment on this.
2) On the other hand, competition makes things trend toward getting better for consumers. In this case,  BTC is incredibly confusing and difficult to use, and I'd suspect another coin could gain significant headway (not necessarily cannibalistic) by creating a stupidly simple UX (software, and especially hardware). Those who are not savvy with tech hold a lot of money, and they might like to invest as well.

yeahh, I mean, change email addresses, open a separate bank account, don't verify your identity with them. Its not a perfect solution, but isn't this all about RISK, BOYS??

n=1; n=2, neither of us have good base sizes.
Someone who is convinced that BTC is currently undervalued significantly will hoard what they have.
Right, the transaction volume is an upward trending line, that is really good news. BUT, we don't know what the value of that line has to hit to stabilize the currency.

n=1; The two people I know with BTC are speculators who have purchased nothing with the currency.
I can make both of those points because the currency won't work with this level of volatility (eg., see the story about inflation rates in Brazil spawning the real), it needs to normalize first, and that will take many things, but importantly transaction volume. When you get off of a roller coaster, you're in the same spot as when you got on.

One other real problem with the volatility is that people who are holding are less likely to use BTC to spend in an actual transaction, thinking that holding out will make them more wealthy. The opposite needs to happen - we need to make it an actual, functioning currency.

Coinbase - create another acct., link another bank acct., buy other coins., merge wallets later. Haven't done it myself, but thinking about it.
