I believe there will be a small amount pre-mined just to simplify the initial release, but that will be surpassed by the normal PoW mining pretty early on.  So you should not worry about the problems that pre-mined coins have had.
Is there some reason you expect the subsidy to be a problem?

Not sure what you are saying there Edser.  There is code on the decred github page for dcraddrgen.  The last few commits in it are from one of the btcsuite devs (me) and it is derived from btcsuite.
The actual decred code isn't up yet, but it is a fork of btcsuite and that code is up and well known.

Just to reply to a few of these points:
1.  The press stories said Bitcoin Core devs, we did not.  decred mostly draws from the btcsuite devs.
2.  The github account is fairly young, but there is code there and more to come.
3.  We didn't have anything to tweet about before so no need for that account before.
4.  I'm pretty sure there are multiple ways to contact us on the website (forum, irc, twitter, etc).  If those are missing or don't work, definitely let us know and we'll fix it.

Speaking totally for myself, I've never believed that there should be one and only one cryptocurrency.  There is (imho) room for more than on cc and I think that is a good thing.  An alt does not need to be seen as an attempt to replace BTC.  Much like how multiple BSD operating systems has positive features and we don't need one true OS.

Has anyone done projections for the hardware/bandwidth needed to run a full node in the big or little blockers (I really like those terms by the way) cases?  I assume someone has and I've just missed it.
I'm somewhat curious since I stopped running a full node a few months ago when my (admittedly outdated) hardware couldn't keep up any more.

Besides the financial incentives (which I haven't thought too much about in relation to side chains) some of us have concerns about the complexities added by most sidechain proposals.

nostdal_org I completely agree.  Just like in agriculture, monoculture in software not a good thing.  I would not want to see btcd as the only bitcoin client even if I could magically make that happen.  Multiple independent implementations are good things and prevent individuals flaws to from being fatal to a system.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:52:12
btcd does have very high unit test coverage which should help give some confidence that it does what you expect it to do.  True it has been used less, but that is going to be true by definition with anything new.  So when you say less tested, it really depends on what you mean by tested.  But we do hope that by putting it out there early we get more eyes which can help catch more bugs sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:03:39
We've tried to write btcd to be as flexible as possible.  That was one of the reasons for doing it in a variety of independent packages.  So while I haven't thought about that use case at all, it is possible someone else on the team has.  Either way, the separation in btcd's components should make it much easier to impliment this than it is in bitcoind (note, I said easier, not easy since I have no idea if it is easy or hard).
If you want, you can submit a bug/feature request on github to make sure the idea remains on our radar.

I have been following that thread.  I understand his concern, and all I can really say to it is that we are taking testing very seriously and have no intention of breaking bitcoin by deviating in ways that we shouldn't.

I actually mainly used a book, "Programming in Go: Creating Applications for the 21st Century" by Mark Summerfield.  I think that would be fairly friendly to a java programmer too.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:53:38
We haven't actually added that one in yet and we are not currently planning on writing any mining software, but I will definitely be curious to benchmark all sorts of parts of it.  I haven't done any serious benchmarking of anything in go myself so I'd be curious about that too.
@_date: 2013-07-19 15:46:08
We don't have any plans (that I'm aware of) at the moment to write up any formal specification, but we do hope that documenting this is helpful for any bitcoin projects.
We do plan on contributing to the documentation on the official bitcoin wiki, we've just been too busy on the code so far, but hopefully we can do some of that soon.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:37:12
I won't be going, but a few of us will be.  I think one will be giving a lightening talk on the Saturday of the conference on btcd.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:39:22
Only the first part (btcwire) has been released although the next piece is due out very soon.  We've already had people point things out based on the code on github (which is the point of putting it up), but I wouldn't call anything a full review yet.
@_date: 2013-06-13 23:47:05
jdeath, that's exactly it, it is an alternative implementation for the scripting part of the bitcoin protocol and part of btcd which is an alternative full node bitcoin client written in Go (but not fully released yet).
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:12:29
We have a lot more code than just btcwire internally, we are just staggering the release to parts as they are at different levels of maturity, so we are closer than that might make you think.
Compatibility with bitcoind is obviously a lot of work, but we test everything against bitcoind, so hopefully we will pleasantly surprise there.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:47:39
We definitely like that feature of sqlite so we wouldn't change without a lot of experimenting that showed serious benefits first.
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:11:57
That is a very good idea.  I've brought it up with the rest of the team and we are going to talk about what the best way to this.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:58:55
Not sure what you mean.  btcd is done entirely in golang which we think is very well suited for this type of work.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:35:30
The source will be released soon.  I suspect that it will either end up at  or at least be linked to from there.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:55:57
If go runs on Synology, then it is likely that it shouldn't be too hard to get btcd to run on it.  We even know of someone who has had at least parts of btcd running on Plan 9!
So, long story short, we are interested on porting to anything we can, although if it isn't a platform one of us currently uses we can't say at this point how hard or easy it will be.  As behindtext said, feature request on github are always welcome.

That is a good argument for open source RNGs too since you don't just have the output.
Of course either way, it is very hard to actually verify any RNG (which is why rolling your own is so dangerous).  I think NIST has a few documents verifying RNGs.

I'd actually argue that lots of money has been lost (or made) due to browsers implementing html differently.  Ads or pages showing up properly (or not) can make or break some businesses.  Not to mention the whole Netscape/Microsoft thing (admittedly that was a long time ago).

First, by writing in Go there are several classes of bugs that cannot happen (and since one can write much shorter code in Go than in C, there is less space for bugs to hide in).  Second, we've strived for as close to 100% test coverage as we can get (using the very nice gocov tool to see our coverage).  While that isn't strictly security testing, a big part of security is making sure that the code does what you think it does, so that certainly helps.
We've also audited the most critical parts of the code by multiple people (with less critical paths still always seen by at least two of us).  Of course the code is on github, so in principle anyone can check it (and we have had bug reports from the outside world which we deal with as quickly as we can).
The btcwallet code is younger than the btcd code so it has less coverage and auditing, but that will certainly change before we make an actual ready for prime time release.
If you have an particular security concerns you think are important, we'd love to hear them.

One other point on the formal spec idea, a single party writing a spec doesn't do much good as there are already existing implementations, where one of them (bitcoind) acts as the defacto standard anyway.  A formal spec would really require all parties to be involved to be of any real use (don't take any of that to mean that I'm not very pro formal specs, just trying to be realistic and practical here).

At lot of the benefits of C, but with decent string libraries included.  A bunch of the benefits of C++ but without the temptation to use templates or Boost.  Nice testing tools.  Very fast compile times.
