A bit translated:
Customers who order food from Thuisbezorgd.nl can pay with bitcoins as of today. Thuisbezorgd claims it is the biggest Dutch website that accepts bitcoin payments. When paying with bitcoins, no transaction costs are charged unlike any other payment methods.

Sorry about that, but all where posted at 'the same time'. When I posted this, there wasn't a post about this.

OK, I have a question. 
If you are having troubles with so many new users, queue's and that all those new users are giving your trading engine such a hard time...
Why are you guys even accepting new users? Why not do a 'new user stop' so that your technical part and support department can get their things straight. And after that, accept new users? 
Perhaps other exchanges will grow a bit more, with new users, but more new exchanges isn't a bad thing right now I guess.

OK, so they want us to 'hope' that it will be fixed as soon as possible... right

Great! It would help a lot if you guys would give some more updates when things are done, also some more accurate dates instead of 'coming soon' or 'coming later'.
Keep up the good work!

Hm, i'm seeing lot's of tweets about this.. Some examples:
Al Gore:" I am a big fan of Bitcoin"  
Al Gore brilliant on virtual currencies "what could go wrong?" Also impressed that he can speak intelligently about Bitcoin. 
Al Gore: "Regulation of money supply needs to be depoliticized.... especially as it applies to virtual currencies".  
Al Gore's tip of the day - don't invest in a wallet factory.
