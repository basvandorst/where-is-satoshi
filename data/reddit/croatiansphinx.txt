A company like [Chainalysis]( It seems [coinbase]( tracks as well.
I guess tracking could be done internally, or through a third party, but either way... I was curious about why they would need to send any amount as well, somebody told me that's what it was, I guess they were probably wrong.
It's not paranoia, I'd like to hear that exchanges don't look into customer transaction paths as long as there isn't a specific request from authorities or something. but I'm not really sure, if a company like "chainalysis" exists to assist in 'compliance' (I'm assuming compliance with AML/KYC/MSB laws), then there must be some good demand for it.

Who is trying to do that and why?

Oh okay, thanks!
Do you know what the spam is? Why would people send out tiny amounts of free money?
Edit: Also, is it just coincidence that the only addresses that received those 'spam' deposits were the ones I've sent to from Circle, and no others?

I recently received 0.0001 deposits to addresses that I sent btc to from circle. They were likely from a new tracking and compliance company. Some of those addresses may have eventually passed through a poker site. It's a game of skill and I've profited. but then I read:


"You still lose"? That implies that they confiscate funds, but surely they don't do that...
I guess I won't be able to use their service. but they do say to e-mail them questions and that they don't want a "surprise breakup".

Absolutely, they have no choice. It's a great service, just unfortunate.

These were 10,000 satoshi though. I still don't understand why people would send 'spam' free money to me, but I appreciate you trying to explain.
