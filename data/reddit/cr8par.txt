...just mean the wallet address types
segwit address features are not available on legacy addresses
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:17:16
Will it get more expensive to use legacy wallet addresses for transfers compared to segwit wallet addresses??
Does it make sense to still use the legacy addresses or to move funds to segwit now rather than when there are larger transaction fees trying to move later?

Any plans to create a desktop app?
Or a version that doesn't rely on google play store for download?...privacy / security...
Linux version?

Would this make the BTC unspendable for whatever the time lock is set for from time of transfer?

Is it an updated version of volume 1 or a completely new read?

Though, attacking BTC would not be seen(by large players/governments) as a terrorist attack, in the same way that the other potential options with advanced quantum computing could be...in fact it might be portrayed as noble or patriotic by some governments to take down BTC, especially as it is not a nation that can say 'we were attacked'...THOUGH I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THE NETWORK STAYS SECURE AND THAT THIS IS ALL FUD!!!!!!!

THANK YOU!!!
If there were a whole lot of other companies and/or people using quantum computers it would be a less likely scenario, but as it seems to be ONLY google who is already so much farther ahead, advancing fast, holding monopolies and the only player that potentially already has this ability that makes me wonder?
...I love BTC and hope this is NOT a problem BUT why would I not share valid concerns??
To say there is no problem and 'that is that' seems a little crazy??
In the long run when more quantum computers are available to everyone is seems like less of a problem/risk... and so I don't see bitcoin being killed off by this, that's not to say that those holding BTC cant loose their funds in the mean time or that miners wont be dis-incentivised. ESPECIALLY if only one player has access to this functional technology for a considerable head start. 
If nobody bothered to look for and at problems, BTC would have no need to exist in the first place.

Are you a quantum expert or is this the professional opinion of an estate agent,architect, lawyer,bus boy,gardener, ...other??

look for the NASA publication about googles (functional) quantum computer. It was 'apparently' taken down immediately... but seek and ye shall find.

Is version 2 very different from version 1??
Can I skip volume 1 and go right to volume 2 without missing out too much if I already understand crypto??
