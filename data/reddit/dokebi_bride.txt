Omgoodness thanks for the info! This is pretty much what I wanted to know and avoid-I’ve heard of branches just keeping people’s bitcoin because they decided to close the account.

What is a hardware wallet? I don’t have that much yet but I would like to start building a nest egg slowly.

If a wallet is just a bit of hardware then why pay so much for it? And if I can generate bitcoin on a computer why buy now? Does anyone know any groups currently generating that I can go all in with now or and good Japanese English speaking sites? I hear Japan is making it an official currency so they can’t collapse an origin source to easily :p

Just putting this out there-Thankyou to any and all advice on this because I appreciate hearing from people on subjects I’m not as knowledgeable about so that I don’t end up looking like a moron. :)

Okay. I didn’t realise that as a crypto currency it had any original country of origin that would require a transfer. Thankyou.
