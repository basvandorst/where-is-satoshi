The market already has the information that segwit is going to activate, I don't see why the actual activation should influence the price

I agree that we should focus on Bitcoin, but notice that the coin_type is also used to have the same master for main net and test net, which is convenient.
We proposed the coin_type level because it seems to be appreciated by wallets using BIP44, but if we see that the community prefers to avoid wasting a level to facilitate altcoin users, we will be happy to remove it.

It has been done manually what two clients are supposed to do automatically following the lightning protocol, so yeah it's actually a cryptographic exchange protocol.

More security due to better mining distribution and more network effect (miners, users, brand, devs, etc). Bcash is still behind LTC on both

Yes, without SegWit it wasn't possible to do the funding transaction in a totally trustless way, with malleability it was possible to invalidate the commitment transactions and require counterparty cooperation to unlock the funds stuck in the multisig.
With segwit both can get the money back autonomously at any moment with no need for cooperation.

Depends on what you need, you can even run a Bitccoin full node on your phone with ABCore if you want

r/bitcoin wants Bitcoin to be the settlement layer for financial transaction cheap to operate so we can have a lot of nodes and keep the decentralization
r/btc wants Bitcoin to have every transaction on chain, use hard forks to upgrade the protocol and eventually have Bitcoin nodes that can be ran only on big datacenters

The witness discount in segwit is already the compromise, anything else is just a political game

UASF and risk of chain split is something extremely delicate that could affect the miners revenues for a long time. You would need a very big reward to make a miner change his mind on this subject.
Anyway now it looks like they are going to activate segwit with BIP91 or even BIP141, so we such donations shouldn't be needed anymore.

If there is a split, I wouldn't call BIP148 a success
