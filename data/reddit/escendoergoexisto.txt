This 4-hour flag/pennant bespeaks a dip. I’m waiting for BTC to break to the downside and test the upper 9s today or tonight. It can definitely go either way. Charts look more like a 5%ish downside break and then play the inverseH&amp;S. Anything would be better than this blasé ranging.

Feelin’ ya on the Friday payday. Why do the best sales seem to hit early in the week?

Res.—10,8; 11,4; 11.8
Close above those and it’s clear to recent ATH...just sayin’

It’s trying to turn up right now.

My bad

...and don’t forget to add in the lost BTC from user error. I forget where I read it, but someone has calculated that amount.

Libra will just be another lame, centralized stable coin. They’ll make bank off the volume if they make it super simple for all the Baby Boomers (their main spending user group) to use. Hopefully, the regulations will only affect centralized coins. Everything I heard yesterday as I watched the congressional grilling sounded so. I don’t think congress can figure out how to regulate decentralized assets.

At most it’ll be a fine...no big deal.

True dat
I’m a newbie trader and an aging Baby Boomer having fun with a new hobby. It’s all good. I can afford to get burned but I’ve been lucky so far. Geeking out on the math of trends and such has been worth it alone; my career doesn’t use my math mind much.

It was setup by a lot of big sells but it’s really just an upside correction, albeit really quickly. Why? There were buyers throughout the recent bear beatdown. When the bear profit margins got too small, a preponderance of buyers were remaining.

Well I bought some at 9,400 but I’m still just seeing a big ole double top with a downside target of 8K on the broader view. Hodling till it hits 8,500.

2 minute warning eh

Ditto on the FOMO gone but I’d call it a bear phase within a bull market. However, I’m getting antsy since we’re around 4 months into this general upswing.

If he tried, my call would be that a large enough portion of his alt-right base would complain and he’d flip. Even if he didn’t, no single government can stop Bitcoin. A collection of the largest governments on the planet could but we know they’re never going to work cooperatively to do so. 
The longer that blockchain grows, the more viable and unstoppable Bitcoin becomes.

I would but I’m thinking the folks on this subreddit get bent if we discuss alt coins. I’ve made more on alts than BTC though, but I definitely try to accumulate BTC during its dips. 
Best to you and I appreciate your positivity, ✌️

As a swing trader, I’m waiting to buy more after a correction to the mid 10 range. If it actually is institutional investments fueling this rise, I may be wrong on that call and will regret booking too much profit at high 11s. If not, the current FOMO will subside and BTC will slide back into its more predictable patterns and have a healthy correction to mid 10s.
