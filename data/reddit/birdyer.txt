Uranium is extremely abundant on earth though, is very hard to refine, and is incredibly dense. Wouldn't this make it one of the worst materials?

Hitler and other nazi officials paid lip service to socialist values in an attempt to gain the support of the working class, that's where that comes from. Nationalism and socialism are incompatible ideologies, as socialism is by definition stateless. Please read the article, call bullshit of you want but please read it.

What kind of liberal bullshit is this? One class cannot assert power over another simply by manipulating a system said other class developed to keep themselves in power. Unless you intend for the proletariat to actually revolt and destroy the state, there is nothing we can do to keep the CIA in check.

Stories like these make me hate my rural Canadian internet connection even more. 50 GB soft cap, with near unuseable speeds if you go above that.

Okay, I see your frustrated, but you are crossing a line with your last question.

Wouldn't that be fairly unlikely? I thought that the last portion of the address was based of the first, meaning that both sides would have to change. Provided the wallet is programmed to check for that.
