The payment was made on July 29, 2012. Bitcoinica was already shut down for months by that time, and had been trying to pay back creditors since the May 2012 theft. Why would Bitcoinica as a company pay Theymos for anything?

don't forget an important point - it is brought to you because someone stole 40,000 bitcoins! no one would care if it were just some random transaction.
