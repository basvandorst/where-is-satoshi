I agree its possible and maybe even a decent probability that the NSA could've done something like this, but we can all agree that it would take a very large set of balls and foresight to fuck with the dollar and its hard to imagine governments pulling this off.  Perhaps its useful to estimate how much was pre-mined and guess the type of hardware that was used.  Was it a crypto-anarchist using his desktop or a server farm?  Also, I notice a lot of people think SHA256 can have a backdoor, but I don't think this is how it works.  
There isn't 100% certainty, but I'd say &gt;90% its a person or a small group of people.  Interestingly in the white paper he uses the word "we" for some reason.  
Edit: that is it seems very risky to launch a crypto-currency like this if I'm a government entity that wants control since it seems to accomplish the anti-thesis of what I want.  Someone could easily fork the code and end up where we are now.

Enough to stake the thing which represents your own economy.

Generally speaking it has to be expensive to cheat, not wasteful.

Electricity usage could be from a renewable energy source like solar and in that case its okay.  If its from energy generated from fossil fuels, coal etc it is wasteful.  If miners used renewable energy it could be no real harm done, but few miners do this because its more expensive and they don't live in Iceland. Realistically the only other alternatives are if the PoW mining was bound not by processors but my say memory like cuckoo cycle.  This type of change to the consensus, or perhaps a PoS protocol, would require a hard fork and no one would really agree.  So the only way is if the market cap drops relative to a competitor and the cost-benefit of mining decrease so we have less nodes doing consensus.  So the best way is for the value of bitcoin to drop due to losing to a competitor, otherwise it seems unlikely that miners would use renewable energy.
