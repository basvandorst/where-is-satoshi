Might be a coin toss for people posting calls, that is because most TA traders making money are busy trading, not posting about how to do it and to buy their courses.

If you buy with a bank account it's only a few dollars, using a debit card or credit card bumps it up more. I like coinbase, been using it for years, it's still one of the most popular.

Bitcoin is also inflationary but its inflation is a baked in specific number due to mining. Dont confuse its asset valuation in other currencies as deflationary. Your argument only holds true now while it is small and on the rise and while pricing it in fiat currencies.

Your looking for speculative financial advise using leverage on reddit. I would recommend asking craigslist about a potential dangerous medical treatments while your at it.

I haven't seen any info on how the cash app is storing it, most likely server side similar to an exchange. For average users that's probably best, if your capable the best would be a hardware wallet, a bit expensive considering your current investment though.
