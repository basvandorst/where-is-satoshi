What's extreme about pointing out that satoshi != God, and why do you keep referring to him in the present tense? How do you even know he's still alive? I guess you're waiting for some kind of "second coming" from your divine leader.
If you can see no irony in treating to the (long gone) creator of a decentralized - i.e. no central authority - currency, as some kind of authoritative figure head, then yes, as your username suggests, you truly are a clown.

Why engage in independent thought to reach sound conclusions based on the current state of the network?  Much better to take a 5 year old comment from a guy who has long since gone to ground as gospel.

That's out of date info. [Myriad forked]( to 5 mins/algo, or an average block time of 1 min. Also went auxpow on SHA256 and Scrypt at the same time.

I've been doing 35% on my most recent few orders. None of them have taken longer than a couple of days to get purchased.

No, it's far from justified. Even if you take out the VOXEL position, their reserve status is essentially 100%, rather than 101%. And this compares to [insert very low number, much less than 100]% for a traditional bank.

I'm not sure dinamic feeing would work, but I'm all for dynamic feeing.

Anyone know of a bitcoin-based prediction market for the Brexit vote?

Wow, it's lucky they have a mathematical genius like yourself on hand to keep them on the straight and narrow.

Who is doing the trading should matter less than the positions they take, and the size of those positions. At the moment, their reserves page indicates that they're long USD, EUR, GBP and VOXEL, and short everything else. I'll confess that I haven't been monitoring their investment performance, but if their positions truly are updated in real time, that should be possible to do.

This is FUD because it conveniently overlooks the almost identical figure in the "Obligations to our members" column for Voxel.
Uphold have never concealed the fact that they keep fees down by speculating. By definition, this means that assets vs obligations will vary for each currency, and change over time as they constantly reposition themselves in search of profitable speculation. It's really no different to a regular bank in that respect, except for the lack of fractional reserve lending.

There are multi-PoW coins already in existence, such as Myriad (XMY) and Digibyte (DGB).

 ZH have a very clear editorial policy on BTC. It is to be derided and mocked at every opportunity. The subject matter did not lend itself to derision or mockery, so they did the next best thing. They ignored BTC as an option. ZH - home of the die-hard gold bug.

No, this has nothing to do kyc/aml. Otherwise, it would affect altcoib withdrawals too. It's a wallet issue at best.

I got an identical reply to a support ticket a few days ago, except for the final paragraph offering to cancel the transaction. They did reverse it for me though, when I expressed my disappointment at their failure to communicate the issue to their customers, stating that I wasn't at all happy to have my btc held hostage.
I converted to ETH to withdraw.

History is also littered with examples where first mover advantage wasn't enough. Let's hope none of that history ends up "rhyming" where bitcoin is concerned.

Curious to know what that deleted comment was about. Didn't catch it earlier.

Not strictly true on btcjam, since most borrowers elect to use the "coindeskUSD" option, which provides a USD peg, thus protecting them from btc volatility. As a lender, this offers the possibility of judging each loan proposal on the basis of whether the borrower's decision to expose themselves to btc volatility (or not) is appropriate.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:40:37
Do you know of a better alternative?
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:57:10
You could put your btc to work by dabbling in some p2p lending. I've been experimenting with btcjam lately. Nobody's defaulted on me yet, but it's still early days for me.

Thanks for the detailed reply. For the reasons you mention, I'd like to avoid going via euros if poss. Your service sounds interesting. Will give it some consideration.
