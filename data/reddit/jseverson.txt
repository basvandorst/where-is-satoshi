Just found this post. You have your facts all mixed up. I founded/started bitnopoly. Then decided I wanted to add a bunch of other games so rebranded to gambit.com and moved bitnopoly game over to gambit.com. There was no purchase of any website/company. 
The database was copied over and all users who had accounts on bitnopoly were moved over to gambit.com along with all their bitcoin balances. Your login should still work and your balance should be exactly as it was on bitnopoly.com
Contact me jay [at] gambit.com if you have problems with logging in, withdrawing, your balance, etc. 
Btw you never contacted me or I never got anything from you.

Lastly I just wanted to say if you haven't been to our site in a long while, check it out. We've done a complete rebuild/redesign and added some new games as well.

Troll. Your scheme sounds brilliant until you realize that all withdrawals from the site were processed manually. Not to mention you would have needed to create 70k accounts to get 7 bitcoins worth..and we only have 25k registered accounts so far. Not to mention we have a minimum withdrawal amount of 10k bits. There are about 10 reasons why your scheme is impossible...but at least your reddit trolling was successful.

I too have had my accounts closed more than once with no explanations or justifications from coinbase. Just BAM...closed! Especially annoying after I sent them over 300 referrals via my website Gambit.com back when we used to be a bitcoin betting site. We haven't offered any form of betting or bitcoins in over a year and they will still shut down any account I open with them that has any connection to my SSN or name. 
I have emailed them, called and left voice mails, emailed Fred Ehrsam directly. Not a single reply from any of them.
What is funny is that at one point coinbase actually sponsored one of the board squares in our bitnopoly game. I had guys from their biz dev department calling to ask me how we can more tightly integrate our services with coinbase, while their compliance department was shutting me down. 
Anyhow, it's annoying that just because I ran Gambit once upon a time as a bitcoin betting site, that I can no longer use Coinbase at all even for my own personal accounts. 
This is why I've moved all my bitcoins over to Xapo! If I had to advise anyone, I'd probably recommend Xapo for storage/buying, and bitstamp for selling and trading.
Coinbase is starting to remind me a lot of MtGox

Just to clarify here, they take UP to 24 hours. most withdrawals are processed in under an hour (unless I'm sleeping) PST.

of course right after they receive my wire deposit the site goes down. how convenient

we've changed it to only beep on the last 3 secs of each round. is that less jarring? or you prefer no sounds?
