I reached out to the CEO on linkdin and they suddenly responded right away. Also, I think they sent me an email with a contact number. I had never been able to find one until then. I'll see if I can find it for you. 
EDIT: I dug around my email and finally found it. 
(800) 343-5845
Good luck! Sometimes chewing out a live rep works better than sending emails.

They didn't wait, you never read their user agreement. Had you, you would've seen that in section 2 they clearly go over the needed info. It's not even hidden in the agreement, you just never bothered to read it.

The point of using it is to keep your money for yourself instead of being forced to keep it in a bank. Circle does this because they have to follow the law, if you don't like it call your politicians don't rag on circle. 
You could've used localbitcoins.com if you didn't want to deal with sharing your info.

I want to piggy back on OP's questions. 
I know Circle is FDIC Insured. If I keep Bitcoin with Circle and somehow it is stolen does the FDIC insurance cover my Bitcoin balance?

I would say yes. If you're still very new and don't own any Bitcoin yet I'd try Circle and then try buying something with the Bitcoin you get. There's something really cool to scanning a QR code and knowing you just sent value over the Internet. After that if you're still interested you can always set up wallets and dive deeper!

Yes circle is fast. It's your best bet if you need $300 in Bitcoin quick. Should be instant for you to purchase it but if you sell the Bitcoin it can take a couple days for the money to hit your bank account.

Yes you can buy Bitcoin on circle. They have been trying to emulate venmo to try and get more users which is why they really push money transferring. They still hold onto their Bitcoin roots!

Circle is great if you want to link a card or bank account to it. Small limits at first but keep buying and they will grow. I've been using it for a while now and I can't recommend it enough.
