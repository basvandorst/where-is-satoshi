are servers bound to try to find each other? or does the network depend on a dht for peer to peer discovery?
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:29:03
how are you preventing notaries from colluding with one another? are these servers supposed to be only used by well known players?
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:05:55
it is though, they are like leeches currently on datacoin full of bugs, since they can't compete with maidsafe they want to build a front end on "top" of them.

most ignorant statement ever. You are suggesting people break the law in Russia, and blockchain technology can be fully centralized under the supervision of a government.

You should try to check these guys out, they are building a decentralized trustless network that does the same things as yours.

genius!, multisignature transactions are the future! no more Mt.Gox!

i made the post right after i found out, no logic whatsoever.

people storj has nothing to do with bitcoin, they are just another alt that ripped off gmaxwell original storj autonomous agent idea. ask him yourself.
10:11] &lt;gmaxwell&gt; super3 started out saying he wanted to build the autonomous agent stuff inspired by my writeup and asked if he could use the name, domain, etc.
[10:11] &lt;hearn&gt; slowly, and in pieces
[10:11] &lt;hearn&gt; autonomous agents are freaking hard
[10:11] &lt;hearn&gt; the number of ways they can be killed by clever humans is just unreal
[10:11] &lt;hearn&gt; i'd start by implementing a program that let you download files for micropayments. that's one part of a file storage agent: charge for your bandwidth costs.
[10:12] &lt;gmaxwell&gt; I said that if he was really going to do significant work to make it a reality, great. ... and then he turned 90 degrees and started talking about something entirely different.
[10:12] &lt;gmaxwell&gt; ... another premined alt, and worse— it doesn't sound well defined enough to say even if its something that can be built or should be built.

since when will storj be built on bitcoin? they are using datacoin. look at their github repo.
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:59:30
interesting project. will keep tabs on it.
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:55:27
look at maidsafe, storj is just a frontend.
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:07:28
and by communicating, he means a couple of posts on the maidsafe mailing list. and by continue to function when maidsafe flops he means he is just piggybacking maidsafe as he is doing datacoin blockchain, providing no value but that of the front end. when some other ui comes out storj is done for.

Storj uses a blockchain, bittorrent a dht, which is much much faster. the above link is a centralized node hosted on amazon ec2, a centralized service ... -_- Shawn Wilkinson does not have the technical ability to do a OS native bittorrent app.
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:00:41
You are not understanding storj, storj's architecture relies on blockchains it will be much slower than bittorrent. Also the server is centralized for demo purposes. The code on github doesn't indicate any decentralized mechanism other than use of datacoin blockchain's
