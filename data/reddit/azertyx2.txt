I tried that too, same answer but you can still use it as a wallet and transfert some bitcoins on it, you can't purchase any bitcoins from em if you're not from us...that's what I understood (maybe wrongly)

to verify the account, they asked me to make a small deposit using sofort...it's the first time I heard about this service and was shocked by the idea of giving my bank credentials to a 3rd party, so I left and opened an account at kraken
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:55:56


and that's the reason i didn't use bitcoin.de, they use sofort as well and there is no way i'll give access to my bank account to a 3rd party
