Well the lightening network will make it fast again, it is a stored value but it’s far from shit. It’s been running non stop for 7+years 24/7 and will be so much faster with the lightening network. Litecoin will always be silver to bitcoins gold

Yeah I hold my major stake in Cardano, bitcoin can die out for all I care, the market share will go somewhere better, Cardano should be heading good places

From my understanding (I don’t hold bitcoin so never bothered going into real detail with it) you can open a “tab” and all transactions will be held and recorded on that tab without clogging the main network. It will make it run how it used to run with virtually no fees again

Not that it will die in value but die in the sense of what it was supposed to be used for (every day purchased etc). How can you buy a $2 coffee if the fees are 10x the price 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:05:40
But you can change the amount you charge, it’s relative to the price of 1 bitcoin. The change in price shouldn’t effect the use as you can simply change how much you charge. 
As for our ultimate dream, it’s never happening, as I said bitcoin will die in respect to what it should be used for and another currency (that I listed above) will take over :)

Because bitcoin wasn’t made to be a stored value, the creator had a vision of a CURRENCY, being used that not one central location could dictate what you do with it. So buying a coffee with bitcoin was really what it was created for, not holding onto it because of its value...

But you still have to pay higher fees than the $2 coffee to use the LN. So what was your point of commenting that?

But then the next day it’s $20k a coin and you now have more than what you charged. You’re being pessimistic to aid your argument, they will take over. Hit that remind button in 5 years I bet you one of the listed currencies is accepted in public for normal every day purchases 
Also just thought I’d mention if you look at the GBP/USD history you will see the GBP is so much weaker than it used to be to the dollar, does that mean my grandfather shouldn’t have gone on holiday there and purchased usd because now 40 years later he would get less than what he originally had, your argument makes no sense

The post summed it up pretty much perfectly. From my experience day trading, you look and see a dip, your heart skips a beat and you wonder if it will continue to fall forever, you think of selling etc etc. Next thing it’s flying high and you think should i buy more now. In short, it’s too stressful, just buy and hodl. You can’t lose in the long run
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:18:56
But how can you tell what’s a dip? You could buy your life savings during a dip and all of a sudden it plummets. That’s the point of “don’t day trade”. Take the over view of the whole day and then make your decisions

This game seems like the tai lopez of crypto

Did you buy at 20k &lt;/3 ???
