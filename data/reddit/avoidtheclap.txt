Except those things have a backing: the USD and other reserve currencies by their respective  economic base and gold/silver by its thousands of years of history as a store of value and even some limited practical applications.

I tend to agree with you, although I would put it closer to maybe $1.25 in the long-long run.  Why? Because it is never going to completely displace the dollar, and at best will be a substitute for the dollar like the pound or the euro. There is literally nothing about it, save for in this pipe dream of being able to do transactions anonymously, that makes it worth anything more than the Euro or the dollar

The fact that it once traded at  $15k doesn't mean $10k is a good price. Sears once traded at $150; it's now at $3.50
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:05:55
Serious question: why do you think this is a "good price?"  One of the reasons I am skeptical about trading in BTC is because there are no undelying fundamentals other than, perhaps, its worldwide adoption rate.  
With fiat currencies, you can at least evaluate factors like growth rate,  interest rate, policy changes, etc.  
So why is $10k a good price? What keeps it from falling to $8k or lower?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:36:14
And that's great if you can predict the bottom of it.  But that's something you only know in retrospect.  
This thing could fall to $2k over the next month.  There is absolutely NOTHING propping it up other than what other traders do.

That's...not a good way to invest.  Since nothing has really happened, there is no evidence that a price of $15k was little more than a bubble.
And projects/research don't really influence the price of the underlying currency.  They might influence the value of the companies *doing* the research, but not the currency itself.  It's not like the ~~EU~~ ~~Euro~~ dollar gets stronger because Merk has a new cancer drug in trial.  (EDIT: Third time's a charm)

Yes, it's probably financed through bond purchases at the moment.  In theory, though, the government could levy a 100% tax (obviously a terrible economic policy) and finance purchases through cash.  That's to say nothing of things like all the land and other property that the government owns, government leases, drilling permits, excise fees, etc.  I know it's popular opinion on this sub to claim that the dollar is backed by nothing, but that's just really not true.
And just to be clear: I'm not saying that the US, for example, is in great financial shape.  It's a damn mess.  But, at the end of the day, it has hard assets that can be used to backup the dollar.  Bitcoin doesn't have anything other than its reputation and trader sentiment.  (People claim the technology itself is worth something, but the proliferation of cryptocurrencies shows that to be just another commodity.  It's like claiming the dollar has intrinsic value because the US Mint knows how to print pictures on paper.)
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:23:41
Those places you are probably thinking of (Africa, central Asia, etc.) don't have the electronic infrastructure to use cryptocurrencies.  And they certainly don't have the volume of transactions to increase the price.  Even if a laborer in Congo put all of his yearly earnings into BTC, he would only be able to buy .0231 BTC

OK, that's what I figured
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:05:12
I think you're exactly right.
The rebuttal I hear to that is, "Yeah, but fiat currency isn't backed by anything."  But that's fundamentally not true.  It doesn't have a bullion backing (i.e. gold or silver), but it is implicitly backed by the taxing authority of the United States / EU / etc.  
In other words, if the shit hits the fan, these central governments have recourse to buy up excess money supply.  Bitcoin has...nothing.

The clause is much more expansive than that.  Congress can outlaw the use of a foreign currency for any transaction.
Also, it occurs to me that the government classifies Bitcoin as property, not currency, which gives them another avenue for outlawing it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:23:19
That's not the way law works.  Congress' power to regulate Bitcoin would appear iron-clad (see my comment below).  The mere fact it has not utilized that power yet does not preclude it from doing so in the future.
For example, Congress could pass a law banning the use of the Euro if it wanted to.  The mere fact the USG has transacted in Euro before doesn't mean Congress has abrogated that power.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:26:45


Well, no, they couldn't.  They could ban the sale of meat across interstate lines, but they couldn't force you to become a vegetarian.
As for whether outlawing Bitcoin will or will not happen, that is a different question.  Personally, I think it will if Bitcoin ever gets widespread adoption.  
But the overall point is that your assertion that some arm of the USG auctioned off some Bitcoin "legitimizes" it and "sets a precedent" is completely wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:03:47


I don't know if I would use the word *caused*, but I think we can certainly agree that the inability of the central banks to expand the money supply was a critical factor in failing to address the issue.  
Ultimately, I just don't see how any large government is going to allow a crpyto-currency to restrict its ability to manage the economy via monetary policy. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:04:39
That's a great story about Zimmerman and MIT Press.  
Even establishing that code is protected speech, however, that just means it would be subject to a strict scrutiny test.  I think the government would have an easy time demonstrating a compelling interest and writing a narrowly-tailored law.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:30:30
Makes sense...although I can see where the transitions to a new unit and people agreeing on what that new unit should be. For example, do you do a new unit every time the decimal moves over one?  When it moves over two? Who names them and decides on a common definition? Not insurmountable problems, I suppose, but a complicating factor.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:04:23
I mean, not much Bitcoin can do other than challenge it in court.  But any lawsuit is going to have a really, really difficult time succeeding because [Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5]( gives the Congress enormous power over currency:  "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, *and of foreign Coin*, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures; [emphasis added]
You could quibble that Bitcoin isn't a "foreign" coin because it isn't issued by another government, but in this case the courts would almost certainly interpret "foreign" as meaning "not issued by the United States."
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:55:27
I'm not sure which case you're referring to. Apple argued that in its dispute with the FBI, but the FBI removed its request so SCOTUS never ruled on it.  If there's other case precedent, I'm not aware of it.
But, as you say, even if that argument won, I suspect that the ruling would be that the code is speech only up to the time where it is "turned on."  Otherwise, you could have people writing viruses and malware and claiming that their code is protected speech.  "The computer did it" doesn't seem like a viable defense.

In this case, would a satoshi be a separate crypto-currency, or just a different unit, i.e. similar to buying a $100 item using a single $100 bill instead of 10,000 pennies?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:17:01
That doesn't mean squat.  Bitcoin is something of value that is currently legal.  Nothing that an executive agency does in terms of selling it off precludes Congress from passing a law criminalizing it, or the Fed regulating it, or the Treasury Department putting restrictions on it.  (You might be able to challenge the last in court, but I doubt it would succeed.)

Yes, in theory you would never have to touch it.  If you didn't sell it, there is no taxable event.
Added bonus: say you hold on to it until you die.  It would transfer to your heirs and get "stepped-up basis."  What that means is that the cost-basis to your heirs would be the price of the asset on the day of your death.
- You buy 1 BTC today at $7,000
- 60 years from now, it is worth $100k
- If you were to sell it the day before you died, your tax on it would be about $14,000
- If you died and passed it on to your heirs, their basis would not be $7k -- it would be $100k.
- So then if they wanted, they could sell it immediately and not pay any taxes at all.

I have a couple of questions about the exchanges -- wondering if folks could shed some light on them:
1) It looks like there are huge arbitrage opportunities.  I'm looking at a couple of different exchanges that are open, and the prices are not lined up.  For example, I see one exchange at $7020 and another at $7201.
2) Sometimes the bid-ask spreads are ENORMOUS.  For example, on Coinfloor, the current bid-ask is $6125-$7230.
I guess what I'm getting at is that the market seems extraordinarily inefficient.  What is driving that?  Just thin volume?

This experiment is pretty much the definition of "Go Big or Go Home."  I got the $218k number by dividing the USD money supply by the number of bitcoins.  That's a ballpark figure of what it will be worth if it achieves its revolutionary goal of displacing fiat currency.  (In other words, I swapped out BTC for USD as the premiere global reserve currency.)
I think if it doesn't reach that goal -- or come close to it as some other of reserve currency like the Euro, pound, Yen, etc. -- its value will be pretty close to zero because at that point the only thing propping it up is the technology.  And while the technology is interesting, if there's one thing we have learned over the last 15 years it's that 15 years from now something new is probably going to displace what exists today.  In other words, I don't think the technology itself is really worth that much in the long run.

Here's the fatal flaw with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:
Until they are more widely traded, they are going to be too volatile in price to get widespread adoption.  But until they get widespread adoption, they aren't going to be widely traded and will remain too volatile.

Why embrace conspiracies when the answer is quite obvious: if fiat currencies have little more than the "full faith and trust" of the issuing government, cryptocurrencies have an even less valuable commodity: a technology that can be replicated relatively easily now that it has been invented.

In general, if something is crashing, you don't hit bottom until capitulation.  I also call it the vomit price, because that's when people throw up on their shoes and sell everything they can.
How will you know you're at capitulation?  You'll know.  It's like a bunch of dementors will enter the room, and all hope and joy will be sucked out.
It's kind of fun, tbh...as long as you're not one of the people puking on your shoes.

If you sell it within a year, it is a short-term gain and taxed at ordinary income levels.
If you sell it longer than a year, it is a long-term gain and taxed at capital gain levels.  If you are in the 10% or 15% income tax bracket, the capital gain tax rate is 0%.  If you are in a higher bracket, it is 15%.  If you're rich, it is at 20%.

Well, yeah -- that's how every exchange works. But most exchanges for different commodities don't have those huge gaps in price.  For example, crude oil a second ago was trading at $63.92 on the NYMEX and at $63.90 on ICE

That list is laughably small.
