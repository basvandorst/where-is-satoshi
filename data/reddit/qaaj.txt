Awesome bar and awesome idea. managed to snap [a pic of the ATM]( too.

Great write-up by Mr. Tucker. I this [PDF]( that the Chicago branch of the Federal Reserve released  is a precursor of things to come, then the future for BTC is looking pretty bright.

Thanks a lot for your answer. Looks like a great way to store the wallet file.

I'm pretty versed in a lot of things IT and I program for a living. I guess I'm just afraid I might do something wrong when saving the BTC's to a piece of paper. I'll probably put 75% of my BTC's in cold storage soon since that's not a good argument. I'll just shit myself when I lose that piece of paper though.

Thanks for your reply. Can you use 7zip to 'encrypt' the wallet file? And does that mean you have to unzip it every time before accessing it with Bitcoin-Qt? Sorry for the questions but a super-encrypted file in my dropbox would be a great and easy solution. I'm currently planning on using FileVault (mac's disk encryption thing)

so, what exactly happens when you acquire the private key for an address? I mean, when I generate an address offline and a private key offline, and move my BTC to that address, is there any way someone else can access the addresses? I am confused because I hear that people sometimes lose their brainwallets because the passphrase they used to generate their address(?)/private key(?) was too obvious...

the backup they send to your email is an encrypted file with your private keys right? No one can use that without having your password, correct me if I'm wrong.

Depens really. For example, I trust dropbox more with the future of my files since their backup-skills are better than mine.

To be fair, to understand the basics of what is written in the paper by Satoshi you don't need a Phd in IT. It's far from obscure. If you can learn the basics of economics, you can learn the very basics of cryptography. The idea is sound and understandable to a certain degree. The implementation of course is much more complex, but is peer-reviewed by thousands of people, black- and white-hat hackers alike.

Isn't coinbase a 'legitimate' business at the moment? Of course this could change in the future if the US decides to outlaw BTC's I guess. I'll look into making an offline wallet, thanks.

Could you elaborate on this a bit? I keep reading the transaction tends to be bigger when it's about small amounts, why is that?

I'm working on a 'Bitcoin Elevator Pitch' that should explain the concept to a non-technical person in less than 2 minutes. In the meanwhile, have a look at the FAQ's in the sidebar, I'll get back to you when my text is done :)

Correct, it's the only way I can enjoy my investment and not check the market every ten minutes. There's no point in trying to chase the lowest buying point, not worth the mental stress it causes.
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:06:38
I'm buying because I believe in the long run the price at this point doesn't matter too much. I try to buy a bit more when the price dips / crashes, but other than that I am steadily increasing my amount of BTC. A pullback is bound to happen sometime soon but as long as you don't sell your BTC's you haven't made a loss.

Am I wrong in thinking coinbase will do a better job at keeping my BTC's safe than myself? It seems like a pretty big company that keeps security at the forefront of it's interests..
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:41:05
Thanks, one thing that confuses me about them is this though - when I create a 'random' address and generate the key that goes with it, is it not possible that someone else will generate this same address in the future? Since the generation of this address happens 'offline', how would the blockchain know that my address is taken? I guess by transferring my funds to this address, but just asking to be sure. Thanks in advance.

I think you have it all wrong. Anyone that is motivated enough can study hard and learn the theory _and_ the implementation behind BTC. Hell, you can even put your skills to good work and maybe join the core development team. You can learn about how the Fed works for years and years but that doesn't make their _implementation_ of the theory less subjective. They pretty much do with the dollar what they want.
