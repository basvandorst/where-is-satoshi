Honestly though, who holds just bitcoin or even a majority nowadays.  Ofc i have it as part of my portfolio, but i also have stuff that actually works great now.

This is not being paranoid, but exactly how this happens all the time.

Don't worry it's just some employees making money, it will be way down for the plebians.

Ripple

I bought close to that to get more iotas. It was worth it for sure.

Let me know when you buy please &lt;3

There is tons of experts predicting it goes to 40k+ in 2018. The market is still small and how many people do you know that own BTC? Nobody knows what the future holds, but the media is just jumping on it and this can get much bigger.

Watch a video on how to buy with coinbase and sending the funds to their owned site gdax. Less fees, but a little harder to use.

Yeah or you don't owe anyone anything. It is irrational to not try to pay the least amount possible.

Despite this bouncing back, you are an idiot. Don't do that.

With Iota just starting up and already being strong, the future is bright :)

Because it is the only thing they ever talk about. Seems like you are in a cult talking about it tbh.

If i can get a day to buy more, i would do it.
