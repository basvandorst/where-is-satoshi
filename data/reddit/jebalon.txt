So people are convincingly being conned through other shit coins because of the whole Blockchain (r) name?  Why do they just ignore bitcoin?  I don't get these people!

this is a comment
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:45:19
so here's my personal FML story with that:
Back in 2013 when interest in shitcoins was at its [peak]( I would casually browse the altcoin forums looking for new shitcoin releases.  
I was there 7-21-2013 minutes after Quarkcoin client was released, right place right time.  I downloaded it and ended up mining around 60,000 quark before it was too hard to mine consistantly (plus Quarkcoin rewards halved like every 18 hours or something).
Thinking that this has no chance, I sold them all on cryptsy for .25 bitcoin.  $25.  Not bad for running the mining client for a few days.
When the bubble hit in 2013, the price of altcoins skyrocketed too (probably because of insane Chinese buying.)  Quarkcoin was going for .0003 bitcoin at its highest rate.   That's 18 bitcoins.  If I only had the patience to wait 3 months, I would have made a nice chunk of change.
I remember reading on the Quarkcoin post, that someone was going to own 1,000,000 Quarkcoin, just "to be a millionaire in some altcoin", and he was buying up cheap Quarkcoin on Cryptsy (he probably bought mine).  I hope that guy ended up converting to bitcoin.

Also--their customer support is great.  I sent some btc to an old address, and never received the coins (you don't have to wait for confirmation).  Emailed them, and within 15 minutes of telling them my prob, I had my coins

I'm fucking with you dude, everytime I buy it drops a bit.  I haven't bought in about a month because of this...maybe I'll buy like $20 and watch it drop 200

additionally, when I was super keen on collecting, I would "cash out" approximately 15 cents worth of bitcoin every week.  That's what you can expect to get out of it, if you're persistent in collecting

Hey now I managed to mine .3 bitcoins in 2012!  Or was it .03?   I don't remember, either way, I remember finding one of those "watch videos and do tasks to get paid!" that paid in bitcoin.  Back in 2010!  You'd prob get .1 bitcoin per task or something insane.
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:37:07
Not like a full time job dedication. I also didn't have any programs or anything, it was all done manually.  Checking the address total received was .25 btc, but all I have left is .1 so that's what I consider.  How much did you get?
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:59:47
I think electrum 1.x could do that, but I had to upgrade to electrum 2.x.  Whenever I would attempt to send the dust with a really low fee it gave some error about not being compatible or some shit.  Honestly I don't even remember, but on Electrum 2.x you can't import private keys AFAIK.  And I can't do it with mycelium either...

Be careful when using bitcoin casinos ya'll.  Anecdotally, bitcoinvideocasino has never done me wrong.  They have quick response for customer service; They've redirected coins when I sent them to a wrong address, and I even left about .35 btc on their site for over 7 months and it was still there when I logged in months later.  Btw it's all browser (or downloadable app) based.

They've (coinbase) been completely transparent about not supporting BCC.  So if you leave BTC on coinbase, it's your fault.

These kinds of centralized blockchains will have no mining component behind it right?  They will be controlled by some admin who can create the currency on a particular blockchain at will?
Is that what this IBM blockchain essentially is?

@_date: 2016-07-26 06:09:47
Almost assuredly so!  And the same with dogecoin and most, if not all, alt coins!
I saw Jeopardy live once, and the following clue came up (as best as I can remember)
"John Roberts succeeded William Rehnquist to be this"
The player answered:  "What is Supreme Court justice?"
There was a pause by Alex as he looked to the judges, and I recall one of the judges motioning very enthusiastically thumbs up.  (Hand "cut it" neck motion for a bad response)
Alex, however, flubbed the line to mention chief justice.  They took about a minute to re-shoot his response to the player.  They replayed the player answering "what Is Supreme Court justice?" And started recording again right after
Hope that was insightful for somebody!

Storing on gdax vs coinbase?  Nothing at all.  However you don't control the private keys when you store coins online at any exchange, so there is inherent risk in that.  But considering the amount of red tape coinbase went through to be operating within the US gives it more credibility then say, like, btc-e

Barring no government intervention or major security breach, one way the critics claim the bubble would burst would be a giant sell off of btc for $$.  Sure the price would drop, but only temporarily.  With over 10k accounts in queue at mtgox, an immediate buying frenzy would ensue.  
Realistically, if you knew about bitcoins prior to this year, you more than likely already had a mtgox account.  The overwhelming majority of those accounts are here to buy bitcoins.  The demand is only growing at the moment.   I see no bubble bursting in the immediate future.
