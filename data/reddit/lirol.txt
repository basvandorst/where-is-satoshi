haha you wish
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:09:08
Dude i'm not selling anyway. Stop beeing so naive about what other people write about bitcoin. Stop beeing in for the profit and start using it for what it can be!
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:18:04
nope... everything works/worked fine for me.
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:10:30
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:46:59
you and me both!
@_date: 2014-11-20 08:41:48
Same old questions, same old answers :) 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:50:36
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:36:02
come one... this is already becoming a joke. bots are doing all this shit because no one is buying...
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:15:17
which hood?
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:11:53
No, don't worry...
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:43:32
because everyone just see the down side 
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:36:54
hahaha this kind a scientists always make me laugh :)
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:24:54
Bitstamp has a SMS price alert?
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:21:52
guy is just trying to make some bitcoins... people are stupid if they are falling into his trap :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:30:54
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:40:53
I think if the shop accepts bitcoin, they will surely have free wifi. Or you can ask someone to set up tethering with their phone. :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 09:54:52
I am
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:26:09
yup! is't a trap :)

Remember... When you'll buy it will go down, when you sell it will go up. Sleep in fiat - price rises, sleep in bitcoin - price declines.
Welcome to BITCOIN world! :) 
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:58:56
did you just sell low and now want to buy it back at the same price?
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:26:19
Sell and you won't be in a bad mood if it goes lower
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:02:32
Agree!!! Price will blow up when noone will expect it to...
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:19:34
You must be new :)
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:40:21

@_date: 2017-02-04 17:53:58
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:25:11
BUYING... why? because coins are so cheap!!!! :)
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:58:48
What did you think? If it goes up to fast then it will go down even faster...
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:38:50
if you had bitcoins for years, i think you wouldn't need 10$ 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:03:12
just bots pushing down the price because noone is buying ATM
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:38:42
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:33:06
what doesn't work
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:17:51
No they are not gone. You just can't use them :)
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:04:27
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:04:20
omg you're absolutly right... how did you know
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:48:12
Haven't you seen the last 20 posts about the 1000 usd?
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:10:27

@_date: 2015-01-09 20:15:15

@_date: 2015-01-03 21:33:37
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:57:19

@_date: 2015-01-13 16:25:36
Don't speak about the things you have absolutly no clue!!!
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:24:53
This is "the floor"
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:53:11
yes, you are wrong. it's just a normal day in bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:25:17
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:22:13

@_date: 2016-03-13 06:57:56
OMG just give them time to fix their issues
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:43:37
who said there was a resistance at 1200?
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:05:09
Then why was the thread removed
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:58:56
Yea... Price is being pushed upwords. Crash is iminent
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:27:40
It's up
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:19:15
Noobs and bots.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:43:21
That's because it's fine. Is it so hard to type bitstamp.net into google?
They are adding XRP.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:29:12
But if you sell now and buy lower, you will have more bitcoins to spend in few months...
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:39:01
Not me... But a lot of people and bots are if the price is bouncing :)
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:09:16
your chart doesn't show last 24h or so
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:02:04
It will crash soon, then blow off faze and then we will go higher. Opinion from my experiance...
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:01:51
You have both
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:38:24
OMG are you serious?
Did you even try checking?
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:13:08
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:34:45
And that exchange is?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:40:52
I think you are a little late to the party...
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:46:20
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:13:09
are you saying i'm not right?
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:14:55
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:00:02

@_date: 2015-08-06 14:05:37
You need to be 18.
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:04:01
how much did you invest?
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:48:25
because people are selling more than they are buying...
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:08:33
You must sell for the price to go UP.. try it you'll see :)
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:58:07
Still BTC
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:19:03

@_date: 2019-04-01 18:43:18
No, he didn't.
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:53:00
What's with all the price posts every 5 min????
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:58:05
Yea, but you said they need to shut down today!
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:31:33
7 years
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:33:57
Until people get tired of it falling :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:47:12
Why would it?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:48:20
OMG... Just sell if you can't hold. They need to close by the end of the month.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:47:52
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:31:33
7 years
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:16:54
This is just a panic buy...
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:05:07
It was bulish for to long... I think downtrend is coming now.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:16:54
This is just a panic buy...
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:56:59
HAHAHA yea right XD
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:01:44

@_date: 2017-09-15 10:48:20
OMG... Just sell if you can't hold. They need to close by the end of the month.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:35:12
Nah... Just rebuy when it drops. Don't worry. It will be soon.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:58:05
Yea, but you said they need to shut down today!
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:35:24
Usless post...
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:16:01
it went up 1000 in 24 hours. What did you expect?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:14:27
But not today :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:52:56
Never listen other people. Nobody knows
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:55:53
Just a feeling from past experiences.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:23:20
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:39:21
There are groups who already do that.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:10:12
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:44:58
anything wrong with you?
@_date: 2019-09-01 10:10:56
Why do you need to do anything?
@_date: 2015-09-24 17:16:52
@_date: 2015-09-24 17:14:41
don't be crying tomorow
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:48:27
around 3000
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:00:00
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:04:14
you all right?
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:04:05
Someone doesn't want to accept the truth... haha :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:19:55
Yes... quickly, sell everything!!!
@_date: 2015-10-13 12:50:39
FYI i have no problems with bitstamp...
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:33:46
last time was like that for a whole month... 
@_date: 2015-10-30 09:37:28
The price will correct soon, don't worry
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:16:37
What kind of drugs are you on dude? And which exchange is legit if bitstamp isn't???
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:12:31
850-1050 lowest i think, then return to normal.
@_date: 2015-10-17 20:06:44
Never ask for that advice on redit... If you gonna sell it will go up, if you buy it will go down. Remember that! ;)
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:51:06
noob trap... this is still bitcoin, never forget!!!
@_date: 2015-10-31 18:28:36
because people are selling?...
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:05:03
Im working with bitstamp since 2013. Never had any problem with them. I don't think they are doing something weird, but some other people do. Just use bots in your advantage ;) 
@_date: 2015-10-30 12:15:30
It may go down to 200. Nobody knows. Or it may continue to 1000 and beyond... Your choise :)
@_date: 2017-07-09 08:05:22
You know you can only wish it would be like that... Fact is, nobody knows what will happen. Whenever there is uncertainty it will always be a dump
@_date: 2015-10-25 10:48:07
Volume bars are different... But remember that this is still bitcoin!;)
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:36:17
hahahaha love the answers :'D this is bitcoin... we can hit 400 or 100 today. you never know ;)
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:16:02

@_date: 2015-10-31 18:32:59

@_date: 2017-07-31 20:02:16
Yea, i know. I edited it...  And i wrote Touche not touché if you so want to go into details. Point?
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:15:36
LOL?! Who is deleting now? hahaha
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:10:13
Only withdrawals and deposits not buying and selling i think...
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:19:53
don't get to excited... this is still bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:12:25
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:40:48
It will go down, but when and how much nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:41:40
I can do math to
@_date: 2015-02-15 07:17:24
no. he has his own plan. lots of people tought that 30k seller was dumb to when he sold at 300. guess he was not ;)
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:59:45
omg you people...
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:13:29
wait a day...
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:20:52
Floor is 0 ;) For now i think it will drop to about 220 than it will go back up again... Next drop could be higher or even lower. Nobody knows. Reminder-this is all speculation...
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:55:04
yea why? it happens every day...
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:50:06
And your point is?
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:17:28
it may still go under 100... you never know ;) i can be wrong as can you be
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:16:39
lol check again
@_date: 2016-07-12 19:04:22
Then wait untill tomorow. Just don't start with "goxed". I am sure it's nothing serious
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:06:20
DESPAIR!!!!! :D
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:45:07
Just wait a few hours and then sell for 2% to 5% more.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:05:02
The biggest wall i saw was on Bitstamp and it was 30k. 1k is nothing
