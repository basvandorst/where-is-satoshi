Wow, such negativity. This is the anti pump-and-dump coin, if you'd bothered researching before making blind assumptions you would have figured that out. Visit our Bitcointalk thread and read a little, then make your judgment.
BritCoin can't be directly mined any more, i.e. Proof of Stake so that takes care of ASIC miners.

BritCoin is much more suited to the British retail and personal finance sectors, compared to Bitcoin.  This is due to the much lower transaction times and the Proof-of-Stake system which means new coins are minted though the wallet, not by a small group of miners.  BritCoin also give you 5% annual interest on all coins in your wallet and has a dedicated team developing new features etc.
And the fact it's British is a good thing!
