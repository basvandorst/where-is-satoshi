He knew and all but me talking about it did yes :) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:40:16
Yeah it was a joke, sorry if I scared anyone

A few week before Christmas
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:18:39
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:25:06
Sure, I'll remember haha
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:31:56
Damn 
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:23:48
Bcash is more useless than dogecoin 
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:40:48
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:13:26
Well this should be good :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:28:24
@_date: 2018-09-09 06:58:13
It's not about that far in haha
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:56:25
But doge coin is cheaper and faster 
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:01:48
True, but I'm talking for utility 
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:17:10
Haha I wasn't hating on doge, I have some 
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:12:34
Doge is way better than bcash 
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:43:35
Hope no one steals it 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:31:14
Haha that's so cool!
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:35:45
That's horrible, they're trying to take little steps that don't seem like a big deal, not even 100 years ago nobody would have stood for this
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:02:19
How do I even go about finding it? 
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:37:35
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:53:15
I had no idea it was on there at all! 
@_date: 2019-02-22 08:55:59
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:48:06
Yeah basically
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:51:18
I had a similar conversation while talking to my friend on an exchange owner passing without spreading key knowledge 
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:02:27
The hell is an early bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:37:42
Wdym? 
@_date: 2019-02-17 06:38:18
Apparently they charge a 7% fee and GST on commission so not the best way to buy 
@_date: 2019-02-06 10:16:58
What cash app man 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:46:29
I need an entry 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:44:42
You were right..
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:37:49
Haha well it should drop anyways because of the cancelled fork
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:46:39
Also the us dollar isn't the only currency, this is the price of bitcoin in australian dollars haha 
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:24:09
I reposted because I forgot to mention it was sarcasm 
@_date: 2019-04-28 11:09:04
Yes the other aspects look good but trust me, if you just lost all your money last year living in Venezuela you wouldn't care to dable in any sort of volatility
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:28:38
Yeah maybe 
@_date: 2019-04-25 10:09:23
Great! I partake in both crypto and parkour haha
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:03:12
Ah I see, that must suck :( why wouldn't you just blow it off and say I don't have bitcoin anymore? 
@_date: 2019-04-28 11:03:48
Bitcoin isn't exactly the best money out there it's very volatile, would you put your retirement funds in bitcoin? You shouldn't
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:11:02
I know man :) was trying to make a joke maybe I should have put /s
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:27:54
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:36:00
Alot do yeah 
@_date: 2019-04-25 10:08:28
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:07:52
Wow, that's a shame :( sucks both ways. Could have had millions and people think you do. I don't get why they wouldn't believe you though 
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:24:35
Sarcasm 
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:28:24
Coinbase, I live in Australia and we actually do not use usd
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:30:05
This is the price of bitcoin btw. Not my balance. I will hold though 
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:28:35
Why? It's not like owning it males you rich, more likely to find bigger money in the bitcoin holders bank account 
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:01:46
The USD? Very much so
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:23:07
Haha 
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:46:37
So you cant buy it anymore but you can have it if you bought before the ban ? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:51:29
Awesome mans!
@_date: 2019-01-29 12:10:00
If you've still got 400k this far down if it hits not even all time high your a multi millionaire 
@_date: 2019-01-25 03:00:55
In that case I'm satisfied with my holdings... unless that means the dollar crashed and now theres a btc gold standard 
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:32:24
Same goes for the us dollar! You cant be reliable for what happens with it, but bitcoin itself is reliable 
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:23:21
Doesn't really matter cant stop it
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:21:53
I don't own any xD sorry :(
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:24:41
Can't believe this
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:48:55
I said it looks like, SMH.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:43:34
True, thanks. I just didn't think of that as if you've made it to bitcoin you'd typically be aware
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:32:19
Yeah, that's what got me into crypto
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:40:57
I mean 4.5% a day? Where does that come from? And his do so many people trust it smh
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:35:38
Because everyone seems to trust it, seems like one tbh
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:32:59
But you don't know?!
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:33:05
Why, cold wallet
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:31:36
What a fucken joke
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:38:07
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:05:51

@_date: 2017-10-21 05:32:41
Yep, the cup thingy
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:28:13
Damn, that's incredible, I knew about bitcoin around the but I was around 10 and didn't care. Shit, I still invest
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:42:25
Thanks for your thoughts
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:32:48
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:05:28
Subscribe, I'm definitely making that...(moofy)
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:33:23
Why, and to what. This is good
@_date: 2018-04-18 09:28:42
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:05:45
Oh shit
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:18:40
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:08:54
175 quadrillion zimbabwe dollars is equal to 1 usd, they have 1 dollar notes. So pointless but I'm sure there has been some sort of transaction with it 
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:23:43
I once saw someone with a Lamborghini in a small suburban area with the number plate BTC they might be btc millionaires
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:23:51
Lucky oof
@_date: 2018-12-01 02:46:05
