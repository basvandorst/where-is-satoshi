Well, that's a 15% markup, which is considered OK.

Bcash retard.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:58:53
This is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:08:50
No, you're dumb. Try saving up for a house in fiat. You'll end up rekt by inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:16:01
Well, imagine if people couldn't get mortgages. The supply will be way higher than the demand, therefore leading to a huge decrease in prices. 
In my country people get 30 year loans just to pay for a 100 m^2 apartment. That's so fucking absurd. And they say crypto is a bubble.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:03:58
If fiat currencies and disappear, then houses and other expensive stuff will be waaay easier to purchase.
Houses are expensive because people buy them in mass with borrowed money.

I also hold a hefty stack of BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:18:02
That's because nobody is getting tethers to enter the market. Bitfinex doesn't print USDT out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-10-25 03:59:58
Oh well, someone has to buy the top.
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:05:58
Dumb bcasher.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:57:48
I had my bank account/card locked a lot of times for all the stupid reasons you can imagine. All their security and AML crap make me sick. I'm just better with cash. I have 100% control over my money.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:28:06
Not really. I deal mostly in cash.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:26:24
Lol, I keep the equivalent of 2000-3000 EUR in cash in my wallet all the time. You're stressing out too much.

Using brain wallets is retarded, unless you have an excellent memory. Basic words/phrases always get hacked.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:49:55
No, it's not. The token you mentioned has a supply of only 20 million.
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:33:37
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:01:51
USDT is NOT an ERC20 token.
@_date: 2019-08-30 09:37:37
Yeah, those scams are worth pennies.
@_date: 2019-08-30 09:40:03
Treat it like (digital) gold and you'll understand the utility.
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:04:26
That's a useless skill if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:53:39
Mnemonic phrases usually have 24 words. Brain wallets can have even a few letters.
Also, who the fuck can remember 24 words in the EXACT order?
If you can remember those, good for you, but don't make other people retards because they can't memorise a bunch of random words.
@_date: 2019-02-17 23:17:36
You'll get rekt eventually.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:10:09
Someone has to buy tops.
@_date: 2019-02-17 23:38:16
True. It's more likely to go up than go down after a 80% decline. At some point all shorts will get rekt hard.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:17:49
DCA is dumb. Better buy is after big corrections and with large amounts of money.

What's so wrong about porn? I've watched a lot of porn as a child and turned out a normal person lol
@_date: 2019-12-29 15:04:03
Someone has to buy the top.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:14:47
DCAing all the way from 20k would have been dumb and would have gotten you a very small profit.
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:12:46
Bitcoin Cash is still faster.
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:00:52
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:20:32
Works fine for me when I want to withdraw small profits fast. For large sums, buying and selling, I use Bitstamp and Kraken.
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:33:58
I only withdraw $100-150 worth of BTC at a time through Wirex, so I don't really care. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:22:19
Why the fuck would you want regulations?
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:19:53
Next time make sure you've backed up your wallet before sending your coins to it.

Gemini is designed for large trading volume. For example, if you trade over 50k/month the fee is only 0.25% for maker.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:16:31
Go all in. Now.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:03:28
My bad, didn't see it. I guess it can be deleted.
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:13:57
I think that's not it. First, Bitstamp accepts deposits only from your bank account, no third parties. Second, I don't think it's that hard to verify an account with fake documents.
Probably the scammer is trying to get the password and 2FA of the account.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:25:42
Yeah, like that means shit in case of collapse.
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:52:34
Why does fiat money have value? It's not like it's based on anything real or has a limited supply.
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:13:14
This aged up well until now. Hope you went all in.
@_date: 2019-05-08 23:07:52
He just acted dumb after he saw the response from the community.
@_date: 2019-05-09 03:12:34
No, they won't. Two years ago I made a SEPA bank transfer from my GF's bank account to my Bitstamp account and it bounced a few days later.
