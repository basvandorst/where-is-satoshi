Ripple - Yuck. wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole. and I see no compelling reason to prefer it over the open-source and more decentralized networks. bitcoin is much more successful.
The basket is very similar I agree, but it's different enough to exist and provide pros. also drastic changes can and will be incorporated in the future (even things like proof-of-stake can be implemented by a hard-fork).
Innovations - Yes, the use of scrypt makes it less economic (although inevitable) to manufacture custom mining hardware (ASICs mainly).
The litecoin devs helped debug and fix many bitcoin upstream problems (like the mac bug). Also, work on p2pool is mainly happening within the litecoin community.
The most important thing going for litecoin in my opinion is the strong backing of very competent developers (charlie/warren and now hank) and without a doubt more to join.

Ok. why?
@_date: 2014-01-11 14:33:04
Sure, the pool operators may not do this (as long as they're sane). but having all that hashrate concentrated in only 1-3 places (AKA *cough* centralization *cough*) means that an evil 3rd party needs only to hack into a few personal computers (owned by the admins of the pools) to mount a 51% attack - and that's unacceptable.

In fact it's quite possible that such a chain exists RIGHT NOW and someone is just waiting for the right moment to broadcast it. ;)
*puts tinfoil hat on*

A couple of reasons:
   1. **Not putting all your eggs in one basket**, relying solely on bitcoin (the protocol and the network) for all the transactions taking place in the world is great - as long as the network operates flawlessly, but that may not be the case for eternity (an attack or just a simple bug that needs fixing may cause some trouble).
   2. **Having more than one SEPARATED high-quality dev team** is an immense boost to the credibility/stability of the entire crypto ecosystem, you want separation because that way youll get more out-of-the-box ideas. Also, you want more than one pair of eyes auditing each line of code - with a single dev team it's more likely that only a single member of the team will work on a specific task.
   3. **Decentralization**. Have a SHA-256 blockchain, have an Scrypt blockchain, and some more... that makes it much harder for a single entity (NSA/China/Russia/BigBanks/...) to take-down the entire crypto-currency ecosystem and discredit the idea entirely. Small reminder - the hashrate of bitcoin right now is 16,925,861 GH/s, matching that will require 16925861 / 3000 = 5642 KnCMiner Neptunes which go at 10k so that's **only $56,420,000 to mount a 51% attack on the bitcoin blockchain** - that's nothing!
There are more, but that's enough for one time I think. ;)

Best semi-technical video on the subject by far

In that case, their lack of communication is worrying. there's no doubt they are aware of the rumours - why aren't they coming out and saying everything is fine (even if the data center is on fire)?
Super unprofessional.

You mean the update from **17h** ago?

I assume youre planning on investing a significant amount (say, at least 1k USD), in that case - why not just wire the money from your bank to MtGox? the fees aren't very high (in fact, probably lower than OKPay).
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:47:57
Alright that settles it for me! I'm either buying or selling right now...
Or later
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:47:43
Most likely, possibly along another coin with faster tx times / lower fees

Not really. SegWit is active on Litecoin. Lightning still has development to be done + user friendly applications that facilitate it need to be developed.

The April volume in USD was still much much higher than it is now... (at least on MtGox).

Well, the current hashrate is ~788456GH/s, assuming you'd use these ( for mining which would give you 180GH/s per unit that costs $10,500 you would have to purchase around 788456 / 180 / 2 = 2190 units for 10,500 * 2,190 =  $22,995,000, factor in the cost of the electricity all of these units will consume in order to maintain the alternate blockchain and you'll have the estimated cost of forking the chain.
