Why hasn't there been any other communication? I bought on April 28th money came out last week and I'm just still waiting. Maybe even just post something on your site, email affected customers, I mean really anything besides just radio silence. 
Also there's no updated time frame on my phone just says should be delivered "yesterday". Can you look into my order? This has been really frustrating as I just decided to coinbase another chance in order to purchase for investments. I'm really glad I did small orders.

haha oh that's how this works? I've been lurking here for awhile this is a pretty fun subreddit. And I was planning to go long on it anyways as nerve-wracking as this is it's very entertaining and exciting.

that's how I felt! As soon as my exchange acct refreshed it had gone from like ~2700 to ~2500 and I was like "what have I done?!". I'm used to going up and down but I've never experience this kind of movement before.

yeah I have a bunch of friends that are all of the sudden VERY interested in btc when they hear it doubled so quickly. The past few years I've been the tinfoil hat guy. They keep asking when I'm going to sell but honestly my plan was just to ride the wave, I'm in no hurry to get out. I don't have much by any means but I've def enjoyed the pop. I discovered bitcoin in college when it was 8 or 9 bucks and I contemplated buying a 100 or 200 bucks worth and sitting on it but I think I bought booze and food instead. It's been a nagging regret of mine for years.

Yeah it wasn't a crazy purchase and it was money I had just pulled out of a brokerage acct. After watching all this movement I was like what the hell why not. Def not going to miss any bills or anything it was just really jarring. lol

Yeah I am too! I just knew I'd regret it forever if bitcoin goes the moon and I didn't get on at some point, esp. after becoming aware of it so early on and not pulling the trigger. I can't imagine how that guy that had like 7500 btcs on a harddrive that he threw out must feel these past few weeks.
