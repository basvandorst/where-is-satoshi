Because you physically hold your bit coin on a hardware wallet. You cant be hacked, and you don't have to rely on an exchange that could end up losing all of your coins. (Look up Mt. Gox)


Google what exchanges are supported in your country.


Instantly 


Exchanges, or in person.






The exchange buys it, or you sell it to another buyer online who is willing to pay what your willing to sell it for. Or if you find a person you can exchange coins by address.

I still think this is the rabbit trail with the most ground underneath it... 24 white words that are both white paper and bip39 words. It's just a matter of figuring out the order.
* order they appear in WP
* order they appear in image
* the numbers and equations help unlock the order
* clockwise or something random 
* a maze starting or ending with the .notdef glyph

I know, but it’s still a pair. Just like the infinity symbol and +1 could represent “infinity and beyond” there’s 24 white bio words that also appear in the white paper.... other clues must lead us to the order or narrowing down the 24 to 12.

I don't think so, corrections are a good thing. And if you're in it for the long run, a dip isn't a bad thing short term. I have a feeling that we're on the cusp of widespread interest in bitcoin, so any major dips in the coming 6-12 months may be the last big sale we see.

Nice, I think I'm somewhere closer to $600 per BTC. I sold off all the alts and enough BTC to cover my buy in. At this point I have two goals in life, retire by 50 and have a nice home, with some land. BTC will do one of three things for me.
1. Allow me to retire earlier
2. Allow me to retire with a bit nicer of a house / a bit more land
3. Or nothing, and I just stay the course I'm already on
I don't have anything to 'lose' when it comes to BTC, but I can still win.

I'd be ok if r/bitcoin was meme free, and we had r/bitcoinmemes as well. I like a laugh once in a while, but I don't want posts for karma to be potentially overshadowing important news and discussions.

I've made this analogy before, I think you're right. Ultimately I think we'll end up with 4 or 5 main crypto currencies that have staying power.

True, I guess that's part of what makes Bitcoin great for many reason, yet a bit terrifying in cases like this.

You can look to the past to see the best time to buy in, the second best time to buy in is today. I help out for a while too, and all it did was hurt me long term. Now I just have a reacquiring purchase every week, and think of it as a higher risk, higher reward savings account, and set it on cruise control. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:09:15
Edit: I wouldn't bother mining, trade if you're comfortable, and only transfer saving you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:11:38
What's the worst that happens if you don't respond? They suspend your account and you have to buy elsewhere?

This, also it personally think that BTC will be the 'gold standard' crypto currency, however 4 or 5 others will emerge as key players as well.

Diversification for fucks sake. 
I'm going to retire early, with some land, a comfortable house, able to maintain my current life style. 
Bitcoin will do one of 3 things for me. 
1. Help me retire earlier.
2. Help me retire with more land/nicer house.
3. Nothing. 
If it's 3, so be it. I'm still reaching my goals because I have money elsewhere. Don't invest money you can't lose, and don't put all your eggs in one basket.

We're still pulling gold out of the ground. The thing with gold is, we don't know how much is left. People need to realize that there's a point where no new Bitcoin will be mined. Ever. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:06:35
Good advice, though I'm already very minimalistic. I subscribed to the subreddit for quite a while.
I enjoy eating out and drinking out with friends, going to concerts, and traveling. To me the experiences I spend my money on are worth it. I budget to the penny, and my finical future is set on auto drive, with a bit more hands on approach with bitcoin at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:44:58
It's a store of value, and easily spendable. It's both.

I searched my google chat logs, and found the first convo that Bitcoin was mentioned. $100 investment on that day would be worth about $79,000 today. The thing is, I was young and dumb with money back that. I probably would have sold it when it doubled. Or freaked out when it 'crashed', I highly doubt that I'd have anywhere close to $79,000 worth of Bitcoin from that purchase today. I probably would feel worse for having had had it and selling, than not buying it at all.

I feel certain that some people genuinely believe them. More understand what he's doing and are taking advantage of the pumps, with no intent of really considering BCH the 'real bitcoin'. And even more still made the jump to BCH and are in denial, they know the truth deep down, but hope if they ignore it long enough it'll go away and they'll end up on top. 
I have to hand it to him, he's smart. It just sucks that he's also evil.

Yes. 


I'd say 3-6, you're not going to gain much interest, put the other 6 months in something with a higher return. 


This should be step one TBH

Thanks for a thoughtful response to a small question. 


I think anyone who started buying in in the past 6 months maybe, but 540% growth YTD is nothing to scoff at. I think the correction was needed.


That's big question.

I think the average American has less of a 'need' in their mind. Most invest with set it and forget it method of 401ks, if they even invest at all. The dollar still has value, nor do they have a reason to research why it's losing its value yet, or be scared of what's potentially to come. (In their minds)
