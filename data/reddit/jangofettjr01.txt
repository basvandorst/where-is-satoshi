This is a hardware wallet?  
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:06:23
A vpn wont solve it?  Also asks for my occupation (ironically not listed hahah) and my employer, source of funds, coinbase use, and dob
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:42:09
I was thinking $500. That is possible then?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:46:53
Alright, thank you :)

Are transfer fees based on coin price?  (Aka do they scale with the coin) or is it dependent on the method you use to transfer/buy/sell

I dont get where hodl came from. It refers to holding on to it right?  Why "hodl"?
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:58:43
Ive heard coinbase has poor customer service
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:55:45
Oooohhhhhh so its for profits?  Kind of like the lottery?

@_date: 2017-08-29 23:01:31

@_date: 2017-08-25 16:49:48

@_date: 2017-08-30 01:32:47
Hey thank you for all of the help.  I appreciate it
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:41:36
Yeah ive been watching this go up and up and up and up. I just havent learned enough on how to manage/secure my coins (portion of coins). I am nervous i will mismanage them. Mostly stumped by hardware or paper wallets. And how to use them
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:27:20
Hahah i was wondering if thats how it started
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:24:08

@_date: 2017-10-09 19:52:19
Is there a chance i can lose permanent access to my current coins. Are you also saying i may have problems buying at the dip?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:18:57
So should i sell before the fork?  And then buy s2x during the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:38:28
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:15:02
Can i buy btc at the fork if btc price dips (from coinbase)
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:19:46

@_date: 2017-07-19 22:38:33
I believe they already implement this. Im assuming security and encryption plays a role. But ive never heard of opentimestanps.org. If you want tge real answer ask Boeing or GE or an us airline. I just saw the article talking about implementing it in the AIAA newsletter

Blockchains are about to be used for aircraft engines so mechanics can see a full and "personal" history of everything that happened to that one engine
