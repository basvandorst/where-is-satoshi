This brings up a general point of cognitive dissidence: if the news is reporting on something you're actually an expert on, you'll know a lot of what you're hearing is over simplified or just flat wrong. You shake your head, 'wow these idiots' you think, and the news goes on. 5 minutes later they're talking about something you don't know much about, and you'll find yourself agreeing with and internalizing information from the same source you were disparaging minutes before, after all, they're the experts, right?

It's like fiat currencies have inherent problems or something... Still, they worked, until someone presented a working alternative.
It's just as fair to say the value of the dollar is going down as it is to say the price of bitcoin is going up.

Oh buddy, you're gonna be upset when you find out what the SIPC is.
Insurance is ultimately a social program, but has several layers of private profits involved. While this does greatly lower the risk presented to re-insurers, and then in turn their risk of actually having to have the state bail them out, one does have to question if that risk reduction is equal in value to the amount of profit they take, or if society would benefit better from eliminating the middle men. If you're skeptical as to the government's ability to run such programs, keep in mind both earthquake and flood insurance are artificial markets mandated and administered by the government.

Governments are made up of people, and their opinions on what is and isn't money shape the government's actions.
You both have good points.
As much as we all love to hype up the freedom from central authority bitcoin represents, this new bitcoin ecosystem still has to interface with conventional systems for paying taxes and selling debts, and as such, bitcoin's legal relationship with those systems matters.

I see why people see this as a 'tin-hat' kinda issue, but I agree with you totally. There will be a point in time when BTC is regarded as a superior currency, at which point it will capture more of the market, and wreck the shit out of the dollar and everything else.
Problem is that right now that's a less certain outcome, and like the posters above said, taking on those kinds of risks is not really Amazons' core business.
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:45:07
Yeah this seems like poor phrasing. To me saying a system is corrupt would imply that it's rules are not always followed, or that some actors have an unfair influence, whereas what total_product_recall and Rune4444 are describing are scams and hacks, which are different. At no point is the bitcoin protocol betraying anyone's confidence, it's just various actors using it in abusive or deceptive ways, as humans are prone to do.
Conventional banking has (or, had) a variety of legal and social checks which are supposed to keep the market free and transparent. They are part of the system, so when we see corruption in conventional banking, we are also seeing a failure of the overall societal protocol to police itself correctly.

Solar panels are a large upfront investment in power, not free power. I guess if you're in a closed system and had excess it would, in a sense, be 'free', but only in the sense that you over-invested in solar, or have such varable power demands that you should be grid tied, in which case the interesting question becomes which is more effective - selling power back into the grid or using that power to mine coins?

Refining oil generates more energy than is put into collecting and refining it, yet I assume you don't consider gas "free".
However, we're now getting a bit muddy on if power is a "good investment" in terms of money vs if it generates more power than was put into it. The first sustained fission reactions will generate more power than was put into them, but, the fiscal cost of all the work leading to that moment greatly exceeds the value of the energy they produced, and will for a long time.

You're referencing the [Caduceus, aka Staff of Hermies]( Seems like a bit of a stretch, I've certainly never heard that theory for it. Then again, the wiki page does mention it has modern associations with commerce and trade, so perhaps.
I don't want to stray too far into tin hat territory, but a lot of the American founding fathers were into Freemasonry and such, so it's not impossible to imagine them promoting this symbol and getting a kick out of it. Occam's razor would say it probably has to do with printers being able to press two characters over one another easily or something mundane like that.

I find the theory plausible, but lacking any kind of evidence. Can I imagine our well-read, classically-trained, secret-society attending forefathers being like "lol of course it's the staff of hermes lol commerce bro!"? Yeah, totally. But given that I wasn't there and have never seen any written evidence from that time and those people directly linking the ideas, how am I to know with any certainty if that connection is real, or just one I dreamed up due to the visual similarity?
I think it's always important to separate speculation from facts. I consider most of history to not be facts, they're more the realm of reproducible science.

Upon re-reading that, I see I wrote it poorly. I meant that facts are more the realm of reproducible science, as in not the realm of history, which is inevitably distorted by those recording it.

I never see much serious discussion of the idea that, if bitcoin were to become as popular as this articles predicts, it will also hurt the price and stability of the dollar, as it has now become an attractive competing option. As that trend continues, shouldn't we expect to see a tipping-point wherein the price of the dollar falls and BTC rises, until you'd have to be a fool to be doing business in dollars?
"To the moon" to me means BTC will eventually leave dollars worthless in its wake, so articles like this trying to evaluate the future worth of BTC in dollars seem inane.

This is the important bit. Much like presidential "signing orders", this represents a power creep which is totally unconstitutional. The other two branches of government _should_ step up and care that the judicial branch is exercising powers reserved for the legislative, but with things as cozy as they are in the halls of power these days I bet this unconstitutional change will just go quietly ignored and soon become established procedure.

Dude, you're fucking things up if you're drawing attention to the anti-fiat nature of bitcoin right now. The banking system is a dino, but right now its tiny lizard brain is trying to decide of bitcoin is something it should eat, fear or ignore. If they had half a brain they'd be fearing it, locking it down and vilifying it, talk like this adds fuel to their fears.
Your not wrong, but this is what the growth of this movement looks like now. The appeal was never to have soccer moms understand money policy, the idea was to free them from a predatory banking system that they didn't, and still don't, understand is robbing them continuously, by advocating an alternative. Telling them bitcoin is part of some complex crypto-anarchist world changing mission is not really helping you come across non-crazy to these people, while also coming across as a shrill dog whistle to those who understand, own, and will defend the current fiat system.
Comrad, at this point people who understand how disruptive blockchains can be need to exchange silent "you believing this awesome shit bro" glances online and leave the rest of this talk silent, mass adoption will require that using btc be as politically neutral as possible, no more radical than choosing to pay with a visa instead of fiat on the spot.

Oh, ACN? They had Trump going on about how cool video phones were in their demo video. I was selling cable door-to-door at that time, conceptually they would have been an interesting fit, but once I spent a little time with then I realized nobody they're actually closed deals and sold products, so I got out of there. Their "starter package" was $500 to get in on their amazing opportunity. I'd love to hear from someone who says they actually made money selling the contact services. In my time selling cable, I practically *never* ran into someone who had acn-packaged phone or other service, and if I did, they were never really in love with the arrangement, they often said they were only doing it because they liked the family our friend who set them up with it, and I often flipped those customers over.

That's a ponzi scheme.
If the organization substantially sells no real products and relies on recruiting, membership fees and event fees, it's not a business, it's a ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme or whatever we want to call it. If a organization uses overrides on sales and ownership of a team as incentives to sell and recruit, that's still a real business selling real products. I work in insurance, and the differences between being an insurance agent and getting into one of these serious MLM schemes seem to me to be superficial, yet they get a very different perception.

Just tossing this out here: I dislike the term "pyramid scheme" because it implies it's somehow different that a "regular job", which, if we drew the org chart for, or especially showed who made what in the org, would most likely also demonstrate the same pyramid-diagram structure.
That's not even really directed at you, I just like to remind people that their "safe income" "normal" job is basically a pyramid also.

It is funny that the people most technically familiar and financially invested with bitcoin are so convinced it will be worth more in the future that they refuse to use it now, which is what's needed for it to enter wider adoption and ultimately realize their dream of higher value.
