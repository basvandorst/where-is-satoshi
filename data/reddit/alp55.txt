Every failure to hard fork.  LMFAO!  Such promotion.

No, the underlying problem is Blockstream has been holding the network hostage since the Hong Kong meeting.  There is definitive evidence Blockstream reps agreed to 2MB and Segwit and then reneged.  History cannot be erased. 
If Blockstream went to Jihan and the miners now and said 4MB + Segwit, the miners would agree but Blockstream would renege again.  
Edit:  If you want to know who is the lying scum, just look at bitcoin.org.  There is no Unlimited download but bitcoin.com is honest and has a Core download.

Yeah that does very little at this point.

Yes...the truth shines through.

I can't wait until you guys fork.  The exchanges can immediately rename your code bitcoin-uasf and everyone else can move on with the real bitcoin and the miners can just bump up the block size.

Here you go...all your questions are answered here:  
  
All documented by King Maxwell himself by calling them names and saying they were strong armed--grown men...strong armed.  
Blockstream and company will just lie and lie and lie while bitcoin burns.

I just gave you the answers you trolling fuck.  I'm not going to repeat them for your retarded trolling ass.  Little bitches like you are the problem and you should be taken out back. 
Men make an agreement and then they stick to it.  They don't renege like bitches--although your type likes that.  
There is proof of my side.  What proof do you have dipshit?    
Direct quote from Greg Maxwell:  


Edit:  If anyone is reading this, go look at this dipshits posts.  Literally everything is defending Blockstream.  He's an obvious shill.

All about percentage.  At what point is it a complete failure?  When 30% can't send, 50%, you tell me?
