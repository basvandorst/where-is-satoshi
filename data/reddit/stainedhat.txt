So he was an older guy and conveniently had only 2 apps on his desktop? And they were both crypto apps? Mmmm hmmmm...

Bitcoin is the safe bet. Bitcoin cash has lost 62% of it's value in the last 3 months. It was a hostile fork that is trying to hijack the Bitcoin name. All they have done is divide the community and confuse newcomers. Your best bet is to stay with the original Bitcoin.

Im talking about Bitcoin cash dude. Bitcoin is doing just fine. Btrash is dying a slow death on the vine.

You should probably get off Reddit and go play outside, ride a bike, hike mountains, etc..

You must either have a serious gambling addiction or some great trolling skills.

I dunno, could be wrong but btc at ~1M USD by 2020/2021 seems a bit of a stretch. Hopefully it won't go under 5k at this point, 10k sure we're basically there, 20k good chance later this year, 30k yeah maybe in Q4 if things keep steam, above that and the market cap starts getting a little big for it's britches right now. The numbers at hand here just seem unrealistic without a near collapse of the centralized banking systems and a takeover by crypto currencies (or a shift of banks moving to crypto under the hood). It makes me feel like we actually are blindly blowing up a financial bubble if we think that another 100x from where we are today is possible within 24 months. Its not $100-$200 anymore! 
The .com bubble blew up epically from a financial standpoint but then settled and the internet has been the greatest change to humanity since the industrial revolution. I feel like the same thing is happening here with decentralization technologies (not even gonna say the b-word). People get exuberant, media blows it out of proportion, people see $$$ signs and try to get rich quick. The peaks of the last two months come from people getting moon lambo'd into a frenzy state with everyone talking about "bit money" and the gainz. Has anything really changed with BTC to justify the run up? Major partnerships with Visa/MC/Amex, adoption by Amazon/Walmart? No, not really. Those are signs of hype. Hype isn't going to bring btc to 1M USD, wide scale adoption within business is.  
Just my 0.00000002 satoshis...

Only one more zero and we're almost at 100k!!!

True, tx numbers are not a great metric of success or failure. A better metric would be the fact that it's lost 67.33% of it's value in the last 3 months.

You win!

Roger will have some serious competition on his hands.
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:38:38
Nah, almost there though. Only 23% to go since it's already lost 77%  since ATH in dec. Home stretch!!
Side note, someone should probably go see if is ok...

Bank accounts aren't affected by the bug to my knowledge. If you used a debit or a credit card in the last 3-4 weeks though, you're in for a bad time. I removed everything and I'm waiting until they remove the fraudulent charges then I'm out like a fat kid playing dodgeball. Probably heading to Gemini until Robinhood is available in my state.

No, OP is a poorly done trollpost. Re-read it closer
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:46:10
Oh man, you just paid $20 for $14 worth of btc. Also, don't try to diversify $14. Just hodl it and enjoy your new addiction.

Why be scared of something that's lost 65% of it's value in the last 3 months? People are negative on it because they've written it off. It was a hostile fork and it isn't working out. Time to move on. The only people shilling it are the bag holders who are hoping to recoup some of that hefty loss. Most likely won't happen though. Since you're mostly holding BTC why do you even care so much?
