Damn, they really all require IDs these days? Guess I'll stick with coinbase then...

Apparently you cannot exchange USD for BTC without an ID anymore. On Coinbase you can't even move crypto without an ID. Can you recommend an exchange that doesn't require an ID to move crypto?

Wow, this is an incredibly poorly informed forum. I guess it's to be expected from reddit... 
I already found my answer btw and I would have shared it with you guys, but now I don't think I will :\^)

Are there ANY webwallets that don't require a photo ID to merely move crypto?

lol that's not even a question, dumbass
you can't just throw a question mark on the end?

Wow, a lot can change since the last time I acquired bitcoin. I didn't have to do this on Coinbase in October 2018. Guess I might as well just stick with Coinbase then...

I'm just curious as to how cucked the landscape has gotten in the past 4 months, the last time I paid attention. I'm already using a hardware wallet. I simply can't believe that every major exchange started requiring a photo ID in the past 4 months.
So do you know the answer or are you just going to condescendingly answer my question with another question?

I just discovered that Coinbase won't let you move crypto without uploading a picture of your ID. Needless to say I'm looking for another place to do business. Any suggestions?
