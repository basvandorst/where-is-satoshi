I don't think he pays much attention to the drug markets, he is more interested in driving out the "illegal" immigrants, hence the ban on some muslim countries. Even students !

Maybe he is a noob who has never heard of OTC? :P Kids playing on Gemini nowadays :P

No they are not anonymous I have accounts both at Huobi and Okcoin both required verification. Don't know what extra "feature" is being implemented. Thank God I took out my funds from Huobi when i had the chance

Did the price go down when Bitfinex got hacked? Yes
Did the price go down when Mike Hearn quit? Yes
Did the price go down when PBoC FUD settled in? Yes
Expect the unexpected.

@_date: 2017-03-16 19:33:13
I guess sometimes even the Honey Badger needs a break ;) 
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:39:37
Looks like Roger has some deep pockets. Not surprising though ;)
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:59:42
Just our daily FUD
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:56:10
also for heavens sake lets just let bitcoin and eth be two separate things for separate purposes. Please lets keep them apart we don't want a debate on which one is better. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:39:00
Yeah it should. Jeff Sessions is a good dude. 
I still don't get how they legalized marijuana in California, and why.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:55:07
dude when the hard fork occured eth was at around $11 and etc at 40 cents
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:39:54
Thank you
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:17:07
I use to follow them on twitter then it got boring and I unfollowed :P 
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:49:34
been there done that ;) 
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:21:57
hopium-addict much?
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:06:34
ohh really
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:07:40
Exactly what I am saying, but at the same time Gold has been in existence for how long? :p Couple of thousand years , so i guess network effect lol.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:05:51
Scared money don't make money ;)

sorry for the wrong title this is indeed by Pesa. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:00:48
Compare the marketcap and then see for yourself :P 
BTW hype is around ETF come March 11 you might consider keeping that fiat for them dips !
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:02:37
Excellent analogy! It is already priced in but traders looking each other in the eye and saying "No you first" so i guess selling on 11th will be our best bet. Nobody wants BTC to go up and up , we all want cheap coins ;)
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:29:27
hahahaha nice one dude ;D
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:30:55
Well well well. Now you know you are being watched every second. Samsung TV's turning into microphones ? LOL
What do you want us to do ? Go hide in caves and disconnect from all electronics? Pathetic ! Simply pathetic abuse of power . 
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:27:40
Porbably after the split has been happened LOL 
I need cheap coins ;)
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:54:46
WHAT IN THE WORLD. Crappiest video ever ! I think he was trying to trolololololol.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:04:23
Well they are definitely causing FUD by doing this and this will end badly for bitcoin. Let's all be prepared for a drop cuz I think, personally, it will happen.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:22:45
Because i think some people want cheap coins and they missed the train at $400 ;) Rojer and his team being one of them LOL 
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:55:14
I knew something was fishy when i saw 34 sec .
