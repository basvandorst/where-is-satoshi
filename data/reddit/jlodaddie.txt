I didn’t do anything absurd to get hacked. It happened. Didn’t lose much. Lesson learned. I made this post just to make people aware. There were people that were victims of this hack that lost thousands of dollars. STOP trying to troll people on reddit and get a life.

Coinomi was android and bread wallet is iOS. I have two phones one for work and one for personal use. Both wallets held very little BTC. I mainly used them to show friends and family how bitcoin works and raise awareness. No clue how it got stolen. Overall the hack stole about 70 BTC but less than 50 bucks worth from me.

That’s the only reason my coinomi wallet had so little left in it because I couldn’t afford to send it anywhere else. Look at the address above on blockchain info. It shows they paid high fees however they stole mine with no fees? Very strange.

I took pics and screenshots. When I get off work tonight I will post links. I am fairly experienced with computers in general but not a cyber security expert. Baffles me. Maybe they guessed my seeds and cloned the wallets. Only thing I can think of is stolen seeds. But it happened to many people. Already over half a million worth. Check the address in subject heading on explorer. Scary shit.

i feel you on this....last time it dropped to 1900 this summer i knew it was a steal and didnt want to sell my eth, omg and neo to buy....lesson learned....always keep fiat locked and loaded

yeah but if you look at its history it has touched 20 twice in the past with the same pattern that its in now....take a glance at the chart...i might pull the trigger on some soon
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:09:27
It happened. I’m not looking for attention. Just want people to know that those apps are not safe.

I can vouch for your sportsbook theory.....they called me today to make sure i wanted to withdraw...said something about fraud....they are HODLing all the BTC they can before B2X.....greedy bastards

Coinomi had no password and only 5 bucks worth of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:06:11
Breadwallet has a pin and Touch ID. Coinomi did not have any extra security. I never put much btc on either wallet and never even wrote down the seeds because I never planned on using them much. Sole purpose of using these mobile wallets were to show others how to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:04:29
yeah im still holding about a grand worth of OMG.....keeping an eye on ETC...i think it can touch low 20s after the B2X split....what about you? any alts you like?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:07:40
Never even saved seeds. Both wallets were for fun. Never put much in them. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:36:42
No. Both phones are secured. Iphone is very secure. Funny thing is both accounts were hacked and coins removed with no fees and very quick confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:30:10
Have no clue. Glad I’ve never kept much on those wallets. I mainly use vaults or exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:37:11
Also both phones use different email addresses and don’t share any apps
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:30:33
I agree. Unless they cloned both wallets? Even then how did they move out the coin with no fees? I’m searching through blockchain explorer and whoever done this is smart because they have already stole over 74btc
