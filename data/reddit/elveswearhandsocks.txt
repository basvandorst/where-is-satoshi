It's a fantastic investment as a hedge against inflation. It's not like it's gonna tank. Maybe when we start asteroid mining, but for now, there's a limited supply of space rock and nothing is changing that. People WILL ALWAYS WANT GOLD. Thousands of years or longer. I love the stuff. I started collecting a new type of gold coin and I'm having a lot of fun.

Is the MyCelium app down for everyone else? I haven't been able to access it in awhile.

The gold market was worth hanging onto from its $1110 "it won't go anywhere again, gold is DEAD" days.

Idk man, I've had jobs where I've gotten paid more to do less, and imagine all the fun you could have with it. Sometimes it's the little things.

No, there's nothing illegal or close to illegal about what I do.
I got a much better response with bitcoin than I ever did accepting venmo or cashapp or Google Pay.
I'm sorry you've never had any hands on experience "in real life" successfully making money and building a good business.

I'm absolutely holding for the long haul. I've been involved in a few substantial movements of precious metals, and the current state of BTC sounds so good and feels so good. I've been using it for my business and it's been nothing but a boon for me. I try my best not to treat it as income and just let it pile up. If it drops I'll pile more. What an awesome business decision this has been. I can afford to lose all my coins so for all I care it can sit there forever and make me money.

I'm really having fun with BTC. A few months ago, I started accepting it for my business, and I've been tucking it away and not making any big moves on it or cashing out. 
My customers flock to use it when it goes low, and I just hang onto it and make money when it goes up. I've settled a few accounts when it's gone up, which is nice because it's free money. My suppliers flock to be paid in it when it makes a substantial move upwards. But of course those suppliers get paid out with a few hundred dollars ($500-$750) so nothing big or anything.
However, I'm going to hold more for longer and settle accounts with money that I include in my tax declarations. There's something nice about having this untaxed, relatively-untraceable money.
Granted, I don't have tons of coins, but every move upwards has been a great move for me. Thus far, accepting BTC has been nothing but a boon for my business. I have a lot of customers who will blow it and won't treat it as real money, just a thing they need to get rid of and can't use in many other places.
I have zero problems holding onto it for them. This is great. If it tanked tomorrow, I'd just make more of it. I can afford to lose all of this money so btc can do what it wants. Hoarding it feels like such a great move.

30-50/mo. I do 10-50 orders a day M-F and ~50 orders Sat/Sun.
Edit: These are all customers who responded they wouldn't do business with an alternative payment method. I've been asking each BTC user for research purposes.
Occasionally, I'll get someone who would agree to a secondary payment option, but said they'd prefer BTC and only a secondary if they had to. Most expressed they're only buying from me since other vendors don't accept BTC.

I'm really liking these ups and downs. I started accepting bitcoin awhile ago. When it goes down people have just been unloading it on purchase orders, and I've been using it when it's bounced back up. No wonder why people are addicted to this. I just squared away an account with other people's money.

It's all clean on my end there's no trouble there. I was speaking in general; I knew right out the gate bitcoin would never be as secure as everyone said it was. I don't do anything bad enough to warrant any strict security measures myself.

I started accepting bitcoin a little while ago and I've been letting it pile up. I had quite a few sales when it dipped down a little and now it's back up. I've made hundreds of dollars just letting it sit there. I'm just gonna let it pile up for awhile and do its thing. If it crashes then I'll buy more. I'd hate to buy on my way up, but at least I really have no need for it, so that makes it easier. I'm willing to throw away the "labor" I did in my business at a chance to just sit here and collect free money. Better return than a savings account.
