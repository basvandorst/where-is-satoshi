Yea it sure seems that way, hence the higher fee I guess... However, I do think it might end up costing even more than 2.9% when the USD are exchanged into CAD by Paypal.

I have USD deposited on a merchant website (OPSkins) and want to cash out to my bank account but have to go through Paypal or Bitcoin. So the merchant will send me Bitcoin (at the USD to Bitcoin exchange rate minus 1%) and then I have to cash out to my CAD bank account but I don't know how to go about this and if it would end up costing more than Paypal after fee's.

How much is the buy/sell spread typically cost? Seems like if I'm already paying 1.5% I am coming pretty close to the Paypal cost already if there is a spread on top.

Ok, thanks again for the help. Why did you say to hold on to some of the Bitcoin?

Ok so let me try to understand this...  
**Step 1:** Get a free Bitcoin wallet from somewhere (suggestions appreciated).  
**Step 2:** Provide merchant with my wallet address; they will send me Bitcoins directly at the XBT/USD exchange rate and charge me 1% for service.  
**Step 3:** Open QuadrigaCX account and fund account with Bitcoins using wallet address (bitcoin deposit is free according to   
**Step 4:** Exchange Bitcoins for CAD on QuadrigaCX at XBT/CAD exchange rate.  
**Step 5:** Withdraw Canadian Dollars to bank account. This should also be free according to above quoted website (Direct Bank Transfer/EFT).  
If this all works as I think above then the only fee I should be charged is the 1% from the merchant. Am I correct with my assumptions and does anyone have any advice on where I should get a wallet address?  
Thank you!

It does seem like a lot of work... it should be easy, transparent and have 1 low fee to convert currencies to bitcoin if it wants to be taken seriously. It seems like if you want to do it right now you have to do hours of research just to figure out how much the whole transaction is gonna cost.
