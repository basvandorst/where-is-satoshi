Spoiler alert:
He's not Satoshi

This is the best thing I've read about the development of Bitcoin.  So sick of the Bitcoin classic propaganda that basically says core is evil.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:36:54


Alright, I have to give it to them, that's pretty clever.
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:01:54
Are most people on the sub pro-core then?
@_date: 2017-02-18 01:08:47
Okay.  Thanks for the response.  I suppose that's logical.  Wouldn't want the community pulling the trigger on a split-chain too quickly.
@_date: 2017-02-19 15:55:04
I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted either.  That was a very valid point.  If Bitcoin fails or loses community support, the miners go completely out of business.  Of course, on the flip side of that, Miners could only be looking at Bitcoin as a short-term investment, as another cryptocurrency will inevitably succeed Bitcoin in the case of failure.

Can you elaborate on this?
@_date: 2017-02-18 00:53:21
I understand that...let me rephrase my question.  Why isn't signaling done by nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:29:29
Can you elaborate?  Are you referring to BU?
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:41:38
And they said Bitcoin was dead...
@_date: 2016-06-12 02:34:37
So tempted to sell right now... But I shall wait
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:45:27
Maybe you disagree with the community (who, despite your eloquent, baseless rant, is still very productive), but the fact that you think that bitcoiners are ignorant has no effect on the concept of Bitcoin itself.  Therefore, you not only generalized an entire community both incorrectly and without evidence, but also drew a misguided line between Bitcoin and the community purchasing it.

**GET ME OFF**
@_date: 2017-01-07 01:49:06
I love this guy.
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:44:37
How adept are you at editing configs and such?  You could probably implement BTCaverage's API into i3bar or lemon bar without too much hassle.
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:37:03
I mean, it's not like the entire Bitcoin community called this like a month ago.
Oh wait.
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:58:54
You are literally amazing.
@_date: 2016-11-14 05:10:33
Thanks for the feedback.  Within the app, can you transfer fiat to BTC, or vice-versa?
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:26:31
You get a 15gb disk with the 5 dollar a month plan...

Thank you so much - new favorite linux feature.  Is the file simply stored in cache, then deleted when you exit?
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:56:45
I have a new favorite redditor :).  Will look into a lot of these.
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:55:04
Will OP Deliver?
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:26:35
This would explain a lot.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:50:01
Voting already began?
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:36:00
They don't deal with Bitcoin anymore
@_date: 2017-04-15 04:11:05
Deservingly so.
@_date: 2016-09-06 03:18:26
Say.  This gives me an idea!
@_date: 2016-10-19 04:17:02
A paper key with a nice note, instructions, and a tamper-proof sticker would be classy and a great example of basic private/public key fundamentals.
@_date: 2016-05-07 04:46:36
This whole ordeal was ridiculous.  
@_date: 2016-05-09 05:02:29
What app privileges aren't concerning nowadays?
@_date: 2016-07-23 00:18:47
This is great.
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:56:01
A great statement on a topic that people need to educate themselves more on before taking a stance.
