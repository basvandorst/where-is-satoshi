The fee is a lot less than 10% for big ticket items. And you actually get something when you list on Ebay: a massive audience. 
There's been plenty of companies that tried to "disrupt" Ebay by offering zero-fees, but it has never worked. Ebay is still the king. So a bit unclear to me what OpenBazaar offers that would attract sellers.

How does any of this relate to what I said? What I said was that illegal stores will most likely be shut down, look at what happened with Silkroad (and that was over Tor which is supposed to be super anonymous).

You mean if they do something illegal? Pretty sure illegal stores on OpenBazaar will be shut down as well.

Yes, but how many normal people would give up the massive Ebay-audience because "OB is peer-to-peer"? My guess is extremely few.

Most likely, a bunch of people jumped on board during the last few hype cycles and subscribed to this subreddit out of interest. As it has been going downhill and people had already lost interest they unsubscribed.

It's the only way to show it, they exist in different quantities, so there doesn't exist any simple comparsion. Anyway - my point was on the trend / percentage, not the actual price, which I think is clear from the title.

That's not his point. His point is that there is a mechanism in the bitcoin system that allows a government to force a miner to censor certain transactions. If miners didn't have this possibility it wouldn't be possible for a government to force them to censor.

Well that's how censorship works. One day the government shows up and forces you to do something against your will. 
If there was a way to technically remove this capability from miners it wouldn't matter how hard the government tried to force them.

They already launched YouTube Red, a paid service which removes all commercials. It's connected to your Google Play account. I'm using it and it works great, 1-click payment.
