By all ISPs. If you haven't had to opt out of anything, it's probably because you already had an internet connection before David Cameron started meddling with shit he has no idea about. Having said that, Sky did decide to force the filter onto me despite me never opting in to it and having this connection for years, so it might just decide to enable itself at some point.

It doesn't work for me in the UK unless I change this drop-down menu from GB - Personal Account to US - Personal Account. Would you mind checking what yours is set to in [Payment Hub]( -&gt; Payment options -&gt; Microsoft account -&gt; redeem bitcoin please?
My theory is that either yours is set to US, or that it's not available in Canada or the UK yet for some sort of legal/technical/regulation reason, although legal and regulation reasons seem a bit strange to me considering recent pro-bitcoin statements from Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the bloke in government who's in charge of all economic and financial matters).
Edit: Forgot [screenshot]( The "view transactions" link changes to "redeem bitcoin" when I set it to US.

I use it in always on mode, because I don't necessarily know whether a website is going to be full of popups and annoying ads that might infect my computer with some form of malware.
I'd much prefer it if websites would offer me an option to donate if I use the site a lot with adblock instead of leaving messages (sometimes rude) that appear to people using adblock, or even design their site to not work at all without adblock (which ironically, you can fix with adblock anyway).

UFC is watched all over the world, whereas NASCAR is pretty much only watched by Americans. I think it would probably get more viewers than NASCAR.

You can still use cash and credit/debit cards 24/7, but RBS/Natwest online banking goes down every night at around 1 or 2 am for a few hours for some sort of maintenance, so you can't make transfers or check your balance online then.
I can send BTC and check how much BTC I have 24/7.

I presume it's a problem on my end, or I'd see other people complaining about it aswell, but when I clicked the link to the site, it just started making loads of new tabs. [About 260 had appeared by the time I closed my browser.]( A bit weird.

They're shit on both sides. I bought something on Ebay, and it never arrived. They refused to give me a refund despite the seller refusing to provide proof that I supposedly signed for it (I didn't).
I've not used Ebay/Paypal since then. Fuck 'em.
Oh, and I also just remembered how they suspended my account for sending my mate £5 that I owed him, and they've done the same thing to several of my mates. I do wonder how they possibly think locking peoples accounts for actually using their service is a good business model.

I've not been trying, but as I say, it does appear under the US - Personal account option, so if you have that you could try that method, though spending may be limited to US Microsoft sites only.
I'm not sure if US - Personal account shows up for everyone, or if it's because I've registered for some specific Microsoft thing that requires a US account. I suspect that may be the case (although it could be that everyone has a US one by default as well as a local account), and the GB - Business Account [1|2] ones are probably something to do with Dreamspark and the time I used Windows Live Domains for email or something. I've no idea and there's nothing I've found that actually explains it.

Don't they already make money by charging to whitelist some "non intrusive" ads for companies like Google?
Why would I donate if they're already being paid to make the extension not work as well with the default settings?

Honda and Toyota both have factories in the UK that produce cars that they export to Japan. It seems stupid, but I guess if they have a certain model that sells more in the UK than Japan, it's cheaper to produce in the UK and export it to Japan than to produce it in Japan and export to the UK, or have a factory in Japan and the UK.

If that turns out to be the case, make sure you demand that they refund the money they took. Pretty sure it's against the law for them to do this without notifying you (I wouldn't know though, I don't live in America).

From your link, I followed a link to [here]( and read through it.
One thing that stood out to me was this:


Assuming the site is actually legit and not a scam or a trap, I bet this will be how they get caught if the site gets taken down. It just seems to me like too much of a risk for a silk road type site, especially one with Silk Road in its name, to be trading currencies taken directly from the site.
The behaviour of the creator on Reddit also seems to suggest that it's a good idea to avoid it.

Any fiat as long as it's in cash. It was just one example though, it's not uncommon for people to keep their savings in multiple investments and bank accounts instead of keeping them all in one bank account. So with that in mind, why would you keep your whole savings in BTC if you can help it?

As great as Bitcoin is, I don't think it's wise to hold all of his money in BTC. It's probably wiser to keep half in BTC, and half in some fiat currency or properties or something instead. It's not a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket.

Might be worth reporting incorrect whois information to ICANN using their [Whois Data Problem Reporting System]( They'll forward the report to the registrar, who should then investigate it.
I don't know about the other domains, but the whois information for easzpay.com is certainly wrong.




















































































































































London is misspelled (appears to be the Dutch spelling of London), and also isn't in Yorkshire. The address also seems to have random numbers in it, and isn't layed out properly.
