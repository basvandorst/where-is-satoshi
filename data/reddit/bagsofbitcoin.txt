Of course he did what else is he going to buy with 6 million? He is goosing the market and will pull the rug out eventually. He wants all those $300 coins for $250 or less. Wash rinse repeat.

Agree. Bitcoin really is a pump and dump game.

Who the hell is going to squeeze a whale. The whales are like institutions they control the market. Your average investor probably buys a few coins. They have 10's of thousands don't fool yourself. That 25k wall wasn't eaten by computer geeks. It was other whales or the seller setting a trap to make everyone think $300 is the floor. 
Whales will force people to sell probably in the $200 or $150 range. Keep buying if it makes you feel good.

Its not going to the moon. Do all of you think that if you invest in say 10 btc that some day they will be worth $100,000 each? You are crazy. It just doesnt happen like that. That is like saying to someone invest $3000 and you will be a millionaire in 10 years. It just isnt going to happen because everyone is doing it and there isnt going to be 50000 new millionaires in 10 yrs because of bitcoin. The financial circles in the world will see to that. quit being delusional. The rocketship left when bitcoins were selling for pennies.

BTc is dead. You guys think because a whale threw a wall up at $300 that that is now the floor??? He wants all those coins that he sold to you for $250 or less. Quit fooling yourselves. Wall street isn't getting in either. Do you think wall street is going to let several early adopter computer geeks run the show? Dream on.

Lol fill your bags bro. Whales will buy the $300 coins at $250 or less. Bitcoin investing is a drug.
