I think its very confusing because we don’t know what info you have, and you shouldn’t tell anyone in case.
However, if you are still having issues - perhaps obfuscate your credentials and post them here, so we at least know what type of information you have. 
So for example, if you have letters and numbers in a string, replace those with any random numbers (keep the same length etc). If its a private key or whatever someone can soon identify it as being a key, and you can then restore the actual real key yourself. Same deal with a username. Make sense? Can’t think of another way to help without you giving out sensitive information.

If you downloaded a local wallet, and no longer have the wallet, or a copy of the private key, then it’s lost forever sadly.
There is no username and password for bitcoin. You have a private key, in its raw form or in a seed phrase, and thats it. That is the key to using or recovering your wallet basically. 
That is unless you have a web wallet, in which case you might be able to login, but that doesn’t sound like it’s the case.

Usually when people say this they are referring to the total value of the asset. I find it kind of confusing honestly, people often say 'market cap' as if bitcoins are shares, when it's just a currency, with no value or earning potential. Gold on the other hand is an actual asset. Still, I guess you can compare the two in a way...
I think what people are getting at is essentially what is the cost of all the bitcoins at the current price, vs the cost of all the gold at the current price. Bitcoin is easy: price per coin * coins.
    11,800*16,700,000=197,060,000,000
In english...**197 billion**.
Gold on the other hand, not quite as easy numbers but I've googled around.  
^1 Gold total above ground stocks: 187,200 tonnes
^2 Gold value 1276 per oz. Google says 35274oz in 1 tonne. So...
    (35274*1276)*187,200=8425801612800
In english...**8,425 billion**, or 8.4 trillion.
How much does each bitcoin have to be worth to 'overtake' gold?
    8425801612800/16,700,000=504539.01
**$500,000 each**. Is that gonna happen in 2 years? No. Absolutely not. Probably. But I'm not gonna promise to eat my left testicle if it is.
Anyway, I'm sure there are a lot more factors in this, and I'm sure the two aren't really even that comparable. I just thought I'd do a rough comparison for fun, so take it as you wish.

Good point. There is also likely a shit load more gold yet to be mined on earth yet. Bitcoin there will be ~30% more, and mined in a predictable timescale. Gold on earth...who knows. and the universe? May as well call it infinite gold haha

Good for you. Don’t get bitten twice. If you can guarantee an easy life, I think everyone should take it.
Remember, no matter where bitcoin goes, money really doesn’t buy happiness. Financial security does, and you have that. More money on top would only be a temporary high but you would end up no happier. I guess what I’m saying, even if it does go up, don’t kick yourself for it. You made an incredibly smart investment and it paid off.

Where do you guys look for the most 'official' (for lack of a better word) value? Seems different exchanges and websites have differing prices. Some have been 11k for ages, but people are only now celebrating it, so I just wondered where the go-to number comes from?
