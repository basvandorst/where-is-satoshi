It’s kind of an intimidating interface if you’re not used to trading other instruments. Regular coinbase has a much easier UI.

Coinbase Pro has cheaper fees and you can buy at the market price. Transfers from either to an external wallet are still free as far as I know.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:15:01
Entirely possible that it has been front run to an extent, but the point is still valid.
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:07:55
It would all be speculation. At my wildest level of optimism several months ago, I thought $7500 by year end would be amazing. We know how that went...
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:05:27
Presumably with fewer coins coming into existence every 10 minutes (6.25 vs 12.5) and similar demand, price will rise.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:00:34
Thanks! This is great!

These are the same people who were calling for sub $3k in March.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:35:15
It really is crazy that the halvening is now only about 9.5 months away. 45,312 blocks to go.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:14:44
I started to reaccumulate LTC at this ratio. I figure there will be at least one more halving-related pump at which point I'll put it back towards BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:50:28
My man. The only thing that matters at this point is that there are 292 days until the halving.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:17:37
Woooooo! Cheap bitcoin. Let’s go! 10 months until the halving.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:20
That's always how it is until they are no longer willing. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:18:08
Will you though?
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:38:36
Maybe pay a higher transaction fee then?

Is subconscious buying a layer 2 solution?
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:52:59
It went to almost 14k too unless you missed it.

This is why we coinjoin at low prices. If they can't tell us which UTXO to present, they don't really have a case. Worst case, they tell us to pay capital gains on what we "spent".
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:01:05
This is exactly what it's going to be.
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:24:22

Yep, no volume it’s a total failure. Consistently increasing volume must be manipulation. Can’t win here folks. Pack it up and go home.
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:16:46
Unless you got them anonymously, it's really pointless to worry about. Just properly coinjoin after consolidation.

@_date: 2019-11-11 20:20:15
1000 sats
@_date: 2019-11-12 03:34:05
I wonder at what point all of these sats will be "bought"... because the sats value changes until the purchase is finalized some 3-6 months later. Something to think about!
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:13:07
Yeah unless you are a miner and have to keep the lights on, I can't imagine a good reason for selling here.
@_date: 2019-03-12 15:34:24
Listened to this a while ago. I honestly couldn't take it anymore after about 15 minutes of Laura Shin not comprehending how multi-sig wallets work.
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:30:19
Honestly, if it brings at least the idea of transactional privacy to the average consumer, I'd consider that a positive first step. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:34:36
You have to add the volume from all of the contracts.
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:31:26
Despite all of the other positive news items in Bitcoin right now (LN explosion, Bakkt launch, ETF, etc.), the biggest driver of upward momentum in price over the next year is going to be the halving which is in late May next year.
@_date: 2019-11-12 03:47:20
Nah, name's great. Sorry you hate it, but the last thing we need in this space is another "bit", "block", or "chain".
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:39:18
Never say never. Maybe Satoshi reappears after Bitcoin takes hold as an unstoppable decentralized entity. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 02:33:17
At least somebody thought the same thing as me.
@_date: 2019-11-16 21:07:10
He won’t. He’s just trolling.

Now less than 38,000 blocks until the halving. Good luck to those not in position. bitcoinclock.com

That hardly makes any sense.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:33:18
Totally missed it myself, no worries.
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:10:14
Yeah trading small amounts on CB or CashApp is a dead end. Your strategy of hodling is going to work out a lot better in time.
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:45:39
If you want to play at the Bitmex casino maybe?
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:16:59
No fuck that. Normally I would agree, but if you own BTC, you should be aware of services that are actively working against that asset.

This just covers the geopolitical influences for the most part. You really glossed over all of the improvements to the bitcoin infrastructure that have taken place over the last 2 years: more fiat on-ramps, segwit adoption, lightning, better wallet UI/UX, etc.
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:52:23
I got a permanent ban there for telling someone to keep their bitcoin and sell their bitcoin cash. They are firmly rooted in their belief that index funds alone will deliver them to the promised land and they won't change their perspective until they are forced to change.

At the very least, maybe we can put $10k to bed.
@_date: 2019-10-09 20:47:40
212 BTC contracts (monthly) traded so far on Bakkt today beats the previous best of 166 BTC from Sep 27th.
@_date: 2019-10-19 16:04:08
Yeah come to find out it was probably several blocks after that due to various shenanigans in the past.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:36:55
The actual reality is that a future rally will probably be crazier than 2017.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:38:27
Wooo! Yeah tips! BTC too slow and expensive. /s
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:23:16
I would second this. Also, I'm not sure what Kraken's fee structure is, but it's probably similar.
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:54:02
They refuse to implement segwit which causes transaction fees to needlessly be higher than they otherwise would if it were to be enabled.
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:46:39
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:32:35
Ah okay. I don't know where to find the historical data, but knew it was on the upper end of the range so far.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:00:16
The network isn't ready for hyperbitcoinization, so be careful what you wish for.
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:06:14
I don't think I've ever seen "ninkompoop" ever spelled out. Not sure how I feel about it.
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:18:23
Although probably the most important component is decentralization, one must not forget how hard it would be to have a fair launch of a new coin in today's world. Anything without a fair launch would also not be fairly distributed.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:52:35
I would say definitely don't try to trade it, but there are places to buy with minimal fees (relative to an ATM or local bitcoins premium).
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:38:40
It's already happened in the past I think?
@_date: 2019-06-10 11:56:03


you mean "giga-meg pieces"?

Not speaking for myself, but even half a Bitcoin is going to be a huge number in just a few short years.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:15:43
48,855 blocks until the halving. Cheers!
Edit: Typed the number wrong. It's actually 30 fewer blocks.

@_date: 2019-10-18 14:31:36
You can track the reward once the block is mined, but it would be hard to say exactly which of the 12.5 BTC is the 18 millionth. It would be entirely arbitrary.
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:23:19
I don't think it's a touchy subject here. That's why I was surprised.
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:22:52
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:53:51
This 100%. But remember to keep track of the fees you pay to transfer, those are deductible.

I guess if you believe all of the new infrastructure (products, regulation, mining, etc.) is going to go to waste then sure, it might be a bull trap. More likely we're just several months from a new ATH.
@_date: 2019-12-12 01:44:43
It’s something I haven’t heard before, think the wider public is too naive for that but it’s certainly interesting.
@_date: 2019-12-19 20:08:16
I think they mean bc1 and not btc.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:47:42
By definition miners will get all of it first. But it’s who they sell to that will be more important.
@_date: 2019-12-12 13:25:42
I think you underestimate how easy it is for people to get rekt themselves. Just look at all these scams that have collected thousands of BTC and are dumping it on the market every day. When people stop being so dumb about BTC they acquire then we can go much higher, in both price and general awareness.

A little over 49,300 blocks until the halving. Not so subtle reminder that it's getting closer every day.

While in the meat of the adoption S-curve, sure that's true. But once/if we reach full adoption, unless you are producing something of economic value, your bitcoin holdings will drop. You will need to spend it to live.

A lot of that property is bought by foreigners that don’t live there for what purpose... preserving their wealth. Not because they want to live there. 
Also, why not lend and capture interest payments on top of the deflationary aspect?
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:14:59
Simplest reason is probably the best: this is our only shot at bitcoin, it can never happen again in this way.

I'm saying that once it stabilizes that appreciation will be lower than it currently is by parking your wealth in equities or real estate. Unless you are super frugal, you're going to have to spend your bitcoin beyond whatever % it gains in value per year.

Listen to u/_risho_, blockchain is a shitty database. If you don't need decentralized consensus (99.9% of applications don't), you don't need a blockchain.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:55:10
All of the other coins in the crypto space allow for experimentation that wouldn't be possible within bitcoin. If everyone were forced to use bitcoin as their crypto playground, it wouldn't be possible. The transaction limit would be hit pretty fast.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:44:32
It doesn't slow adoption. If bitcoin were a single player, adoption would be slower.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:23:52
Being trustless doesn't necessarily have any bearing on security. A centralized service is often very secure but this is counter to the argument for bitcoin's existence.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:40:31
Yeah even at 1 million dollars, it's still a very small piece of the pie.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:11:49
You're thinking about this purely from an inflationary point of view. As an example, real estate values will likely plummet under a deflationary system because people will no longer need an alternative store of value to protect the value of their fiat wealth. It simply becomes a place to live. 
I can assure you the wealthy are making way, way more by investing or lending out their money under the current system than they would sitting on it under a deflationary one.
@_date: 2019-12-23 11:18:19
It’s a nice thought, but unless hash rate collapses it’ll likely be early May.

It does to some extent, but that's not why we saw a 2-hour block interval. $10 million of mining equipment is probably less than you think when considering how much mining is occurring on a global scale.

@_date: 2019-09-14 01:49:52
This is not true.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:32:11
Easily the biggest news of the day.

Exactly, with Bitcoin there's always a risk/reward trade off. You took tremendous risk by being an early adopter - there was always a chance that a software bug or malicious actor could have killed it in the early years. And that's still possible today, if the risk were lower, the price would be far higher than it is currently.

Misleading. They are starting user acceptance testing in July.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:38:58
It's a side chain from what I understand.
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:05:08
Yes, this is a scam attempt. If you claim it for yourself (requires KYC), then convert to fiat/BTC yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:03:14
You don't really have any other choice. CashApp has a similar UX and allows withdraws.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:27:07
Thanks! This is awesome!

I’d prefer to get it directly from the manufacturer, but that’s just me.
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:15:09
The scam is you send him the XLM you have claimed and he disappears without ever sending the equivalent USD amount back to your Paypal account.
If you can claim it yourself by completing their know-your-customer (KYC) procedure and then you can sell for fiat/BTC. Personally, I don't think it's worth the hassle and I'm generally against anything that validates Roger Ver's actions.

Poorly worded, but yes, I meant by market cap.

I would hope Jameson Lopp also maintains this domain, but it's a good inquiry.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:14:27
Cost to mine is a function of the difficulty. If the reward isn't a high enough incentive (based on the price), then you will see miners turn off until the difficulty adjusts down.

bitcoin.page also works as a shorter link!
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:02:30
This is awesome! Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:08:49
Great site. Switch to a segwit address! :)
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:19:26
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:19:33
What time zone?
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:46:43
Yes, in theory, although I'm sure there are other factors at play that I'm not aware of.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:09:14
You bought the top of a parabolic move. What did you think was going to happen? It’ll recover, just be patient.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:22:27
I was ecstatic when they released a mobile app, but I got hit with the fee the first time I used it and haven't been back since.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:10:01
Don't use the mobile app. Set a limit order on their website. Flat 1% fee regardless of position size.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:54:39
Math is hard
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:41:48
This exactly. It's unbelievable how few people have gotten to a point where they are generating their own addresses.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:45:48
I buy frequently on Gemini - if the fee is % based it doesn't matter how often you buy.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:10:14
Let's fucking go.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:22:56
I can't think of a better endorsement than the largest company in the world building their tools on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:41:34
Good to know! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:50:14
Easiest is probably Cash App. Best? Maybe Kraken.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:55:53
Don't worry their bi-annual "upgrade" is just in time to crash the market. I can't believe anyone still buys it.
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:34:42
This really is incredible and very exciting!
