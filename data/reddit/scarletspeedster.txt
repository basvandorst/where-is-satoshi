Personally I just use Bitcoin-QT encryption and a very long passphrase. TrueCrypt for some added security. If you're worried about key loggers there are other options, but honestly if you have a key logger a lot more could be at stake than your Bitcoin wallet.

Would you be so kind as to list the features you'd like to see in a mobile Bitcoin app?

I am working on my own Bitcoin Exchange app. Should be available within a month or two. I hope everyone is careful with what they install, check the permissions before installing any apps on android!

This is taken from their website.


There are fees with many of the services available. This fee is generous in comparison. Especially when transferring only takes 5-10 mins.

I transferred 2k yesterday afternoon, and it only took 10 mins. It's definitely not everyone.

When I first purchased it took me a few days to settle on someone to buy from. I have been using [bitfloor]( ever since. Today it took 10 minutes from Bank to Bitfloor.

My favorite thing about Bitcoin is that it is intelligent money. We haven't really had anything quite as smart as Bitcoin in all of our history.

As someone who is currently using the API in a new app I'm writing, thank you so much!

Yep, did a deposit at BoA today. Drove home and bitfloor was ready.

Checking it out right now, the simplistic design is really nice. The android app needs to be as convenient as this one. Although I would never copy, just take inspiration from it.

I agree, my experience with [bitfloor]( has been wonderful. Low fees, and quick transfers.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:30:36
I don't mind at all. The fee on the 2k was 2.5% ($50).

Lots of negative bitfloor experiences here, but I have to say every time I use them my money has transferred from bank to bitfloor in 10 minutes or less. Including an email confirmation. Sad to hear other stories are so different.

I can offer my help. I also recommend looking at this:

I think Mt Gox, Bitfloor, BTC-E, and Coinbase all have had breaches of security at some point. I recommend not letting any one exchange hold your money for very long. Although I am a fan of Bitfloor.
