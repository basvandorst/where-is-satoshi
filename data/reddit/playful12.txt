Yes, it is the right link.  China does not have a financial credit system like we do and is implementing one that is currently opt-in now but mandatory by 2020.  Indications are that it will function as social control, meaning your score increases the more you conform AND associate with those who have high conformist scores.  Access to goods and services will depend on your score = social control on a MASSIVE level.  Groupthink.   Companies in US and elsewhere are looking into designing similar social controls
@_date: 2016-08-28 18:53:25
A lengthy planning document from China's elite State Council explains that social credit will "forge a public opinion environment that trust-keeping is glorious", warning that the "new system will reward those who report acts of breach of trust".

I am in agreement with your thinking and perspective re wholeness and our being as strong as our weakest link.  And there may be reasons and value to "weak" links beyond our immediate understanding.  Stay open and continue to explore the possible!  Thank you for your contributions.  Playful engagement is inherently more risky and more creatively transformative than forceful domination.   It is also very difficult to quantify, hence difficult to value, given the limitations of the current system of objective performance based measurement.  Subjective experiences and intrinsic motivations de-coupled from third party brokers and validation systems may help us emancipate ourselves from mental slavery ? (thanks b.marley)

"Countries like Barbados, Peru and Ecuador have already leaped passed conjecture, concurrently offering a digital variation alongside their physical currency. Citizens there use digital currency for everyday items like groceries and fuel for their car, facilitated by smartphone technology"
I'm just back from Peru and asked around re bitcoin.  no one knew what I was talking about.  This article feels likema lot of hype.  So much needs to be done to get the bitcoin messaging out, but hyping it does little to establish a legit foundation IMHO

Thanks for bringing up a different way of seeing and approaching all this.  Not sure the groups involved, interests at stake, powers that be value this non judgmental approach and expecting them to be or behave in a different way becomes our issue, not theirs.  All we can do is be responsible for ourselves and our own thoughts and behaviors.  The zen masters say if you wish to change the world, begin within.  Our world is simply a mirror, a reflection of our inner landscape.  Each of us can assume radical responsibility for our own behaviors and thinking, and eventually I think the astute and wise among us, rather than the brash and arrogant, will be revered and looked up to as models for emulation.  When we use coercion or force to bully or dominate the external nature of things, it indicates compensatory behaviors from inner suppression or deprivation-- a lack of honoring our own nature.  Sustainability begins within, and the transformation for global peer-to-peer transactions, communications and creative interplay sans domination or self-interested manipulation needs its  models.  Bitcoin developers are for now the bridges between legacy systems and its either-or thinking, and new revolutionary and creative ways of being and interacting.  They have their value, role and function, and like all else, if they do not adapt to emergent self-organizing systems they too become obsolete.  The creative 
advantage lies within resilient playfulness, not fixed, stereotyped and/or rote ways of being and doing.  Stay open!  (so hard to do within such bifurcated environments!)
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:02:26
Here I am responding to myself..ha ha. But this is actually a huge issue.  Binary thinking, linear thinking is very helpful to the engineering mind and because of it's logic and step by step approaches can, is and will be the self-Learning for AI and machine program/Software development, eventually displacing many developers with their own tools.  The mind concerned with feeling-states and their endless subtleties, creative connections, and endless states and flavors of experience will drive creative expression.  This is not easily or well replicated through machines and the mechanization processes we currently use.  Perhaps the emergent quantum era with its computing will address this better, as it is not as deterministic as digital, and relies on the power of possibilities and potentialities, and celebrates the unknown.  We are pointed in this new direction and ways of being...
@_date: 2016-04-24 15:46:42
This connotes the differences in linear thinking vis a vis deeper multidimensional web thinking.  The linear thinking of the industrial era served us well... Up to a point.  Many very erudite scholars predict the emergence of an era where  the feminization of thought will self organize and prevail, and this appears to be in alignment with the emergence of the world wide web.  So despite all these growing pains and challenges in communications and consensus building, we are on the right track and the dynamics and challenges predictable.

Haha...  Yep, Sanders got a chunk of change from me, but ya know, I just had to give him a little help since he was being so "above it all" and setting a standard.  Bottom line is that I would have a tough time with Sanders in office, as I think his ideas are ossified ideological slogans with little inventive or inovative ideas to support  them.  Hats off to him for framing setting and the discussions that otherwise would not be addressed.  Now let's find a president  who "gets" Bitcoin and how we can generate employment in an emerging decentralized economy.  45% of jobs are eliminated by robotics and AI in the next ten years.  We gotta square that circle or face massive civil unrest in untold ways.  Not one presidential candidate  
 has mentioned this yet!  Trump simply says he's gonna bring back jobs from China and Mexico.  Those jobs are quickly being eliminated as well.  We lack true authentic and inspiring leadership.
@_date: 2016-04-24 10:04:15
Well, i guess stealing/hacking a central bank and transferring that fiat into the safety of  bitcoin blockchain is one way to do it.
@_date: 2016-04-30 22:40:46

@_date: 2016-04-24 19:15:11
Well, perhaps a "cess-pool" is another way to describe a highly chaotic system.  It is from highly chaotic systems that self-organization emerges.  Not much emerges from little chaos.
So it may not be either-or, and perhaps both?  A cess-pool AND a perspective that highlights incoherence? 
Bottom line:  self organization is an emergent process from highly chaotic systems and it's messy.   Like Andreas has indicated, we collectively are on the right path.

I read the Bohm piece.  I get what you are trying to relay and value it.  However, I'm not sure you can change patterned thinking and ways of behavior via a Reddit message board.  Perhaps dialogue, an exploration and journey through information and strategies and perspectives, can happen with the facilitation of an astute group leader whose only responsibility is to help the group self generate internal guidelines for non judgmental communications ?   Failing this, "consensus" reflects the most powerful and dominant.  It is important to realize, however, that even with process-infused dialogue, minority positions may be voiced and heard, yet continue to not shift majority positions.  Quite honestly, this reminds me of the dynamics often found between women and men's communication styles, where women "process", want to be heard and deeply understood, feelings and all, and men typically just want to "fix" the issue and be done with it.

Once you put money into a bank, you have relinquished your money and technically have given the money to the bank which they now can use however they see fit. It is no longer your money, but the banks money. Your putting the money into the bank gives them permission and the ability to use that money as they see fit.  Reclaiming money loaned to the bank often becomes problematic.  If there is a crisis and an acute liquidity problem emerges, do you think you will see "your" money upon demand?  If so, what makes you think so?

It could happen anytime up and through March 11. If no decision is announced by the end of the day, it is accepted by default. 
What I don't get is this:  if it's evident it won't be accepted and the SEC doesn't play games, why not just say "sorry folks this ain't gonna happen" now?  
Why wait until March 11, at the last hour?  Is this their game?  Is this usually how they operate?  Anyone know?

This may be one big reason for the SEC to support the Coin ETF, and the means by which the US increases tax revenues.   Early bird gets the worm. Most/many people would invest in Bitcoin through an ETF instead of learning about how to buy, storage issues etc.  Its  the path of least resistance for the sheep who choose not to think for themselves and want to defer minor challenges  to third parties.

I'm not a techie but my understanding is that second layer is basically a walled garden that settles on Bitcoin.  Any walled garden block chain has centralization and hence vulnerable to regulation. This is an assumption and if you have clearer insights, please correct my understanding.

Trademarks are not patents.  The author of the article needs to not use these two terms interchangeably.  Second, trademarks are established through evidence of commercial use.  Uphold and AA will have to show who used the term first, as evidenced in marketing materials, and more.  Finally, it's my opinion that Uphold will have a hard time trademarking common words used to describe a product or service.  They could more easily trademark a new term like Kleenex or Bitcoin than a description using common words and asserting it is a trademarked phrase.  The Internet of Money is a descriptive phrase as opposed to a phrase that REPRESENTS Uphold.  The phrase must represent through commerce the entity which wishes to trademark it and the entity must show it was represented by the phrase first through commercial means.  In patent law it is all about "first to file" irrespective if who was the actual inventor (recent change to patent law in US). That's why all the banks are submitting patents for bitcoin-related IP.  Trademarks are not "first to file" but first to establish use through commerce.

Extrinsic reward systems are not false in and of themselves and are important to operant conditioning.  However, they can and do contribute to cultivating desires or behaviors  that otherwise might not emanate from within or are self-generated.  For example, I have never felt a need or desire for a certain kind of scotch, but after seeing Blue Label associated with gorgeous women, hot cars an material success, I may purchase and consume the product even though I don't particularly like scotch.  Monetary wealth may not be an extrinsic reward system in and of itself, if it is fueled emotionally by desires to use money to experience that which is intrinsically- driven.

So they want to regulate Bitcoin. How can we stop them if the means by which they will regulate is through the exchanges and legislation, e.g., if you "illegally" transact in Bitcoin and get caught you go to jail. 
Bitcoin itself is immutable, but second layer applications can be regulated.   
This is causing me to re-think block size debate.

There was an iconic movie with Mae West, who was a sassy gal for her time in which she said to a  fellow:  "is that a banana in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?". It was a very edgy joke for its time.  So the meme above picks up from that and uses Obama's words spoken at the recent SXSW Conference put to bitcoin and incorporates the famous Mae West saying in a very modern way.  It would be very difficult for a non-American to understand this meme, and I'm sure many here don't quite get it either.

What the market immediately thinks it wants vs what  a brand new ecosystem can envision for itself are two different, yet related, things 
If a homeless man is only thinking about his next McBurger to fill his belly, it's hard for him to envision a new life full of opportunity and possibility for himself outside of what he already immediately experiences.  Perhaps the best he can do is yearn for more of the same, 10 burgers instead of one.  
It is imperative we address the immediate needs of those using Bitcoin.  However, envisioning next steps to secure the immutable blockchain while scaling globally into the internet of value is highly creative and never been done before. 
We screwed up the internet.  All sorts of interactions are brokered.  Let's not do the same for Bitcoin. The Industrial Age and its standardized one size fits all thinking must give way to new ways of interacting and valuing interaction.  Peer to peer without an intermediary is authentic engagement and crucial to our species' survival and sustainability.  
Optimizing Bitcoin to grow and scale safely and creatively is addressing the needs of users, albeit many  may not see it for themselves.  Not everything of value can be easily measured.  In fact the most valuable aspects of life are immeasurable.

"In addition to RSK’s advanced smart contract capabilities, the sidechain also has the potential to decrease the transaction burden on the main Bitcoin blockchain. “We have the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP), which allows 2,000 transactions per second on chain and the Lumino Network which will allow up to 20,000 transactions per second off chain,” said Kurman. “Every single developer is going to be able to plug in, and run their contracts. It’s going to operate against the Bitcoin testnet for a month approximately, and then we’re going to apply [it] to the Bitcoin mainnet.”

Today we are in a different, much more healthy situation with many numerous exchanges and decentralization.  And yes, people have a genuine interest in Bitcoin and it's growing!  I'd love to see daily use for transactions grow, but perhaps that comes with micro payments and LN?

@_date: 2017-08-02 12:25:41
All this exacerbated by the SEC going after altcoins as securities with perhaps some exchanges shutting down.  
Because Bitcoin is decentralized/distributed and not considered a security, new altcoins  (like Bcash) will  hop on as a side chain/fork to Bitcoin and carry on.  
You nailed it.  This is the new attack vector. 
I don't have any idea how to avoid or fight this. And I wonder how much hashing power will be lost?

Thank you for your kind words everybody.  I work with the National Institute for Play and with my partner Stuart Brown MD who is the founder of the Institute and what is now known as Play Science.  Www.nifplay.org.  
To the millenials:  this is a gross generalization, but contains truth.  When you were growing up there was a huge push to take the popular business mantra of the time, "what can be measured can be managed", and apply it to education, hence teaching to the test and uncreative educational practices that turned learning into schooling.  This converged with the rise of computers and standardized platforms that made measuring faster and more efficient.  Unfortunately many of you grew up with misguided former hippy sell-out parents who had creative unstructured play in their lives (look how creative and innovative that generation was!), but because they wanted to prepare you for the dog-eat-dog world of global competition, and the japanese had bought up prime US properties, we threw the babies out with the bathwater and made measured performance the mantra.  You were loved for your performance standardization, not who you were as a unique individual with innate talents.  No, those were not recognized or valued by society.  Your conformity was valued and extrinsic reward systems took over and drove your lives.  Many millenials were so over-structured and controlled by helicopter parents and teaching to the test teachers that the free time to authentically play and learn who you were, what your talents are and what you love was suppressed... to your psychic and emotional detriment and health.  Do you know that millennials are undergoing the greatest mental health crisis of any generation since WW II?  Anxiety and depression run rampant, and both of these behaviors can be linked to play deprivation.  
It's not you, so-called narcissism, or other reasons.  Your play was hijacked and many of you are paying a huge price.  And ironically, we all suffer as well.
So why am I ranting all this on a Bitcoin forum on Reddit?  This is why:  You are now facing the demise of the industrial era and its centralized institutions, as well as its economy.  In the next ten years, 50% of jobs will be eliminated due to robotics and AI.  You will be forced to literally RE-CREATE yourselves!  So not only are you screwed as far as finding good paying jobs and paying off college debt, but now you have to figure it all out from the inside-out so you can authentically follow your calling and do what you love in life.  That's not an easy thing to do when one has had their play suppressed and/or hijacked.  This challenge is now both a blessing and a curse.  Radical self-responsibility means you don't rely on others, the suits or obsolete institutions, to fix what ails you.  YOU are the answer to the problem.  
Fortunately we now have the tech solutions.  This is huge, and Bitcoin is integral as it truly is the driving technology for artisanal peer-to-peer economies.  However, do you have the spiritual/emotional skills, the type  of skills and talents developed through authentic play, that are not about measuring performance, as much as the capacity to be resilient and optimistic in the face of huge tumultuous change?  Only you know.
So should you like so many others feel lost or stuck, I suggest the first thing you do is explore and find your play.  Yes invest and hodl Bitcoin, but please also invest in yourselves.  This world needs people who not only know how to transact 
 in Bitcoin and can measure their success by what they own, but perhaps more
 importantly can help re-create it  in a more compassionate authentically engaging way that reflects this world's beautiful diversity and creativity.  God/Universe knows we will need a tremendous amount of creativity and innovation if we are to ever survive sustainably on this planet, much less survive as a species.  My generation helped screw it up.  Your generation needs to play!

Fair enuff.  He does make a couple of good points, and those points have been made many times by many others, so they are not unique.  However McAfee draws press due to his colorful character and the end result is that many people will associate their introduction to bitcoin (whatever that is) with Mcafee.  I think MSM may be using McAfee's colorful character to create public initial impressions around bitcoin.  Otherwise why use him as opposed to any other person with similar insights and points?  Just wondering...  I may be off target, but just wondering.

It's pretty obvious, and much to my chagrin, that more Bitcoin altcoins will be introduced in the blockchain pretty much controlled by the Chinese and others more concerned about personal profit than what's good technologically.  Until the issue of mining decentralization is mitigated, and I'm not sure it can be effectively because centralization of  asic production, we need to see the new normal for what it is and stop screaming and start thinking creatively.

Upshot:  looks like the strategy is to split the hell out of Bitcoin and create all these new Bitcoin spin-offs for profit
BInance is launching an ICO PLATFORM (the NYSE of ICOS) whereby an ecosystem of Bitcoin spinoffs could develop.  When asked about whether this may reduce the Bitcoin store of value, the Chinese interviewee said investors were more interested in profits.  
So from reading this and knowing great numbers of Bitcoin purchases come from Asia, with mining centralized in China, it appears the driving force of Bitcoin will in fact be the market and chances are, it won't be the market I am used to.  
As a woman I cringe with the matter of fact  "one Bitcoin, one (pretty woman) model" objectification.  What's next for BInance marketing, "one Bitcoin, one seven year old?"

I was recently thinking of how I could gift my 11 and 12 year old niece and nephew bitcoin.  Giving them each a whole bitcoin is a bit out of reach for me.  However, this note provides a great solution.  I could gift them each 1/10 of a bitcoin with the proviso they hold/hodl for ten years. They are introduced to bitcoin and hopefully begin to learn more about it because they have some, perhaps even accumulating more.   In the meantime, this note indicates value and is easy storage of BTC.

The person who deserves the Bitcoin reward here is the one who thought this competition  up!  What a great way to laugh at the ridiculous immature bickering going on.  Yes, this is a story about the tension between lovers.  Theymos and Roger find that the tension between them was relieved on "Mountin' and Bit'n My Bro's Back"
The  two lover boys gently fondled each other's bitcoins as they gazed deeply into the eternal depths of each others portals to the  soul.  As they fingered, licked and explored each other's codes, each desired the others address, and  the breathing became more intense, quickening as lust thrusted through their loins.  All they could think about was merge mining the depths of the other, physically, emotionally and spiritually.  
Afterward, resting in Theymos' arms with his man stroking his hair, Roger shared his deepest yearnings. Spank me Theymos!  Yes, spank me!  Roger shot up, turned over and displayed his skinny shiny muscular butt, tweaking it upward for the slap.  Theymos quietly whispered, "Roger my dear boy," I love you so.  I wish you no harm and no, I won't spank you.  Your hankypanky is not for me.  I'm your endearing lover and not your playboy.  Save that for Craig Wright.  I want to know your code and mine the depths of your soul... Ours is not simply a binary love.  We are exploring the quantum realm of all possibilities my dearest.  Come, please come with me, as we explore together in love the possibilities for all of humankind.  This is more than just you, or me.  This is us, making history, creating something larger than our individual selves.  Come, dance with me to the cosmic harmonies of our bitstream....

Make sure there is a solid development team and technology development and not just a vapid get rich quick scheme. Personally, I stay away from ICOs as they are applications.  The money won't be made the same way as the dot com bubble-- in applications.  The money is made in the foundational blockchain platform--  so Bitcoin, Ethereum and maybe NEO (tbd).   The rest is a lot of hype.  And many many will fail.  I'm concentrating on the foundational framework of the overall infrastructure.  Not all will survive or thrive, but if you dabble in a few of them, one might in the winner, negating all other losses. SO HODL. This will be a bumpy ride with a lot of FUD.  I think China is a force to be reckoned with, so don't write them off.  Fortunately we have some fabulous Core developers, but there will be shenanigans in covert strategies, etc.  There is a lot of money involved and a lot at stake.  We aren't getting the full picture of what's happening in Asia so we could be surprised.  I hope not, but there are no guarantees on any outcomes.  Stay open to all possibilities.  HODL don't trade. Keep your private keys offline in cold storage. Play it safe and be patient.

Thanks.  I did read the white paper, but I struggle to synthesize and visualize how this works.  I'm not a techie, but I'm finding that the more I read and try, the better I get.  Thanks for the reminder/explanation.
I do think LN is the way to go.  Securing the foundation via Bitcoin is paramount, and huge blocks sizes appear to threaten the foundation.  After segwit adoption we should raise block size AND figure out how to better distribute the miners.  Can Elon Musks satellites which will increase Internet speeds by 200 x also help mine and secure the blockchain?

This point is excellent and one in which many people don't understand or consider.  LN must enter and exit Bitcoin and while it "bundles" micro transactions that are extremely low fee, the actual feel on and off Bitcoin we increase exponentially, raising fee revenue to miners.  I wish someone would explain the Chinese miners holding out adoption of segwit and LN.

Your response was helpful to me.  I never realized that LN would basically curtail larger blocks by it's off chain bundling.   Got it now.  that means that truly, Bitcoin could grow exponentially and still maintain integrity.  Since I'm a big thinking kinda person, I like this.
I also like that we learn from our history.  Why re create limitations for greed and expediency?

We know that if you buy and hold there will be fluctuations in price but since we hold long term, the price trajectory is up, up, up.  Buy and hold.  Keep in an offline wallet like Trezor.  
So asking about short term fluctuations in price and when to buy is really irrelevant.  Buy and hold.  Tell yourself you won't touch it for at least 3-5 years, maybe longer.  Period.  End of story.

This is mind bending.  In essence, the only way this plantoid DAO is able to survive and thrive is through Bitcoin donations from people who experience from it some kind of aesthetic pleasure.  They reciprocate with Bitcoin donations and the plantoid uses the donations to hire artists to replicate itself through offspring works of art. 
This is huge, as it foretells an incredible resurgence of the arts within technology while fomenting creative cottage industries employing people to do what they are creatively inclined to do, motivated from within.  I can visualize whimsical DAO plantoids and similar works of art all over the place, bringing us joy and engagement through design.  WOW!

Ignorant question on my part.  I've only used Trezor once and that was to move all my Bitcoin into cold storage using Trezor.
So here's my question:  I'm undergoing trust  and will document work.  If I leave one Bitcoin each to various family members (4), can I buy a Trezor for each now, and then directly transfer from my Trezor to their Trezor for cold storage keeping the one Bitcoin, that can then be dispensed to them upon my death?  
Keeping Bitcoin in various Trezors and in safekeeping would be important, but do I have o go through an exchange like when I initially deposited my bit coins into me main Trezor?
Thank you in advance for he help.

Could it be that Bitcoin becomes the foundational settlement layer, while other tokens or coins become the vehicles for transactions so that Bitcoin really isn't seen, used or referred to-- the store of value.  All this while other coins and tokens steal the limelight of popular use and hipness?  Bitcoin becomes the fuddy duddy true blue workhorse to the popularized coins and tokens of the day?  This does not means Bitcoin loses value, in fact the converse is true as the blockchain becomes the platform for the transfer of value through contracts, services, IoT, etc.  It just appears to me that the Bitcoin foundational layer of settlement will be very provincial and boring against the other zippy coins and tokens.

What if national fiat currencies became crypto currencies settled and anchored  on the Bitcoin Blockchain?    
In reading various postings on Reddit, one can see numerous countries looking into this already.  And look at Circle.  They seem to be leaving the exchange business to set up this infrastructure.
In any event, the settlement layer of Bitcoin is poised for great growth.  It will be up to people to decide what coin they wish to transact with, unless govt regulation dictates otherwise, which is really where the struggle and debate resides and why getting this narrative out and into public consciousness is so important.

Sounds like all parties need a third party facilitator.

These issues have been addressed in this sub and in other places.  Bitcoin will become the settlement layer of the blockchain technology. As such it must be made secure and designed responsibly in such a manner to act as that settlement layer and store of value.  This is laying the foundation for much to come, including massive scaling. 
Compromising security and decentralization by reckless scaling so the corporates and their companies can rake in $$ is not in alignment with Bitcoin.  Let them do their thing on their own chain.  Eventually, the largest most lucrative transactions imaginable will take place on Bitcoin while other retail transactions and micro transactions will be grouped for mass settlement on Bitcoin. 
They got their bcash and larger block size.  Let them leave bitcoin alone and work on their own thing.

Unless of course the one pointing is not a sage but a manipulator of group-think. 
There are plenty of times when one needs  to look at the finger. and consider who is pointing it
In the 60s there was a similar saying eluding to the fact that the source of pointing of the finger, the one diverting mass attention to something else, needs to be studied.  Hence the savvy radical looks at the finger so as not to be hoodwinked by charlatans 
I wonder where Andreas lifted this saying and why he chose it...

It may really spike.  And because of the run up, it may cause others to jump on board.  It may also cause Bitcoin the loss of valuable development technology going forward.  It may not happen as well-  who can accurately predict the future?
As I have said, this is a street fight and logic and rationality do not prevail or motivate.  Anyone thinking Bitcoin cannot be severely compromised is in denial.  
Bottom line:  if Bitcoin cannot ward off these attacks and it becomes centralized, then Bitcoin is not what many of us had hoped for and worked toward. 
BItcoin may hard fork by the miners, spike in price and use cases grow, but it will not be fully realized as a decentralized, distributed peer to peer technology that will anchor other currencies,  smart contracts and IoT to an immutable blockchain. That could not happen when one group, like the miners, led by two men as a front for China, hijack what was once hailed as decentralized, distributed and immutable. 
We must find a way to decentralize mining asap and reclaim Bitcoin's potential for the world.  Otherwise we have simply traded the federal reserve and centralized banking system for another similar centralized global authority.  
Bitcoin must withstand a contentious hard fork attack by centralized Chinese miners.

I think the miners think we are subjugated to them, their workers.  Since they mine the blockchain, they are its stewards.  They think we must rely upon them, and hence, they have power regarding bitcoin's next steps.

Bitcoin is not a "safe" investment.  Anything can happen.  
Life is not safe.  Anything can happen. 
If you do not understand the fundamental revolutionary technology of Bitcoin and why it is positioned as "digital gold" and possibly much more, then I would either delve in and learn more to rationalize your risky investment with a huge upside, or pull out and put your money in what you consider a "safe" investment
It's an individual and personal choice.  Good luck.

Sorry. That's not my intention.  I am trying to wrap my head around the politics and world view from the miners point of view as it relates to alibaba perhaps causing havoc to miners interests.  I was wondering if anyone has insight on this, as I read something about this but lost the link.  Alibaba could create their own blockchain but could also use Bitcoin.  For now, I understand they are sitting out the scaling debate and watching what is unfolding before making a definitive move to take the Silk Road global.  JAck Ma has met with Trump and they've discussed small business development scaling using alibaba network.  And of course, it needs to be on a secure blockchain.   So there is behind the scenes discussions about how this will happen.  Imagine the transaction fee possibilities.  I think this ties into the current scaling debate and perhaps has motivated miners?

It's a funny universal law of nature that when one's ego and bravado become out of alignment with the greater natural patterns  or flow, that Mother Nature hits you with a big fat 2 x 4 and invites you to wake up.  
Many of us know this to be true and can self regulate and/or navigate life fairly well without inviting huge awakening drama into our lives.  They just get it.  Others, myself included, jump all in with the best intentions, enthusiasm and commitment and become blinded by their own egoic narrowed obsessive compulsive behaviors.  
This is why we must always consider not just a technological solution but more importantly, a biomimetic solution which can be endorsed by our own nature within Mother Nature.  Mother Nature loves diversity, resiliency and iteration/interplay. Rigid, fixed systems are not long lasting solutions, and applied  by force of will, will cause great harm and eventually fail.  
To disintermediate human interaction through new technological models, while safeguarding at all costs the immutability of the matrix, is nothing less than heroic .  Human history will look back kindly upon our heroes.  The rest of us must have the vision, wisdom and courage to help articulate something larger than ourselves.  Nothing less than the survival of the species and the planet is at stake.

Not satire, perhaps ignorance, but I like to think of it as imagining the possible.  Yes, I wouldn't want Bitcoin "automatically" leaving my cold storage, however I'm wondering if there is not a new mechanism for making its transfer easier.  Maybe some sort of smart contract?  Just thinking....
I don't relish having to be on top of replenishing funds in my everyday wallet for LN micro payments for fear of a hack.  Kinda user unfriendly, yet I understand the reasons behind it.  Just wondering if there can be some innovation around this to streamline while ensuring cold storage security.

How easy would it be to put a "tap feature" into place that transfers Bitcoin from Trezor or some other cold storage to easy usability onto a debit card or mobile phone app.

So if I am understanding correctly, this is like having a bank account for each of my payment channels I will have to manage and fund upfront.  I have to open a payment channel for rent and fund it, making sure there is enough to pay monthly billings.  Same for PG&amp;E, car payments, etc etc.  I could have 10-15 of these channels to constantly fund and manage.  Sounds quite cumbersome, really.  Hope I'm wrong.  Why not just open one payment channel and fund everything from that?  Same amount of bitcoin would be at risk, as I replenish that channel each month from cold storage.  If everything can be hacked and my wallet bitcoin stolen without recourse to recovery, how is a wallet any better than today's  bank?
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:47:35
Yes.  Patent law has changed from who invented the invention to first to file.  This is why they are filing hand over fist to claim IP territory, whether they invented it or not.  They will claim it and sue yer pants off, stifling any innovation on either private OR public blockchain.

As a woman with experience investing in Bitcoin I am happy to provide my brother my viewpoints. I trust you are open to all points of view
I hope you would withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange (this is true for all exchanges), as it is a centralized vector for hacking. You could lose your investment if you are providing permission for them to hold your Bitcoin
The best way to hold your Bitcoin so it is not susceptible to a hack or theft is to own it and house it personally
Please study about cold storage  like Trezor or ledger  or a paper wallet.  These ways of storing Bitcoin have an air gap between the internet and centralized control and your bitcoins' private keys.   These private keys should not be shared with anybody. If they are, someone can access and move your Bitcoin and you no longer have access to them.

I did that for the newest generation in my family:  one each for my two early twenties girls and one each for my niece, 15 and nephew, 13. Bought at $375

On a similar note, I read that owning one Bitcoin is the equivalent of owning seven square miles of earth.

This is the basic common attitude of most people.  Most people do not care about the ideology of decentralization behind Bitcoin, could care less about whether it is immutable, and only are concerned about personal profit, ease of use and convenience. 
While this manner of thinking may be stupidly self-centered, unaware, self-serving and ultimately harmful to ones self and others, the masses of humanity are driven by emotion and impulse and not the logic and math behind Bitcoin. 
I must question whether the logic, fairness and elegance of Bitcoin prevail and succeed despite all the human emotion and impulses to the contrary.  Truly, it may come down to our own folly that Bitcoin does not prevail while our own species is wiped from the earth.

I'm a Tone Vays fan. I don't trade BTC or anything else (I learned my lesson).
I hodl now but I used to trade the stock market (making many hundreds thousands of $) but lost everything (including my beautiful home) as a stupid ego-arrogant cunt. 
The man has integrity. He is at times very difficult to follow  and listen to because of "form". But I will say this:  he is the most ballsiest of analysts in that he puts himself and his expertise/reputation on the line.  I respect that. That is a rare attribute these days.  He acts as an advocate.  If you young farts don't see this in this man it's because you may not know what that looks like or it's inherent value.  Too much screen time perhaps.  
Stay strong Tone!  Call it as you see it... Tits and all (I saw that LA episode/interview).  Good on ya!  And I'm a woman.  Big hodler.  60 years old and been around the block.  I study this four hours a day for years.  I know what's coming.  Patterns.  And I've seen a scams and bubbles in my lifetime. 
Tone brings great value to this ecosystem.  Young squirts:  pay attention and dont let your arrogant hormone-filled bravado get in front of you.  It will be your undoing.  Judge less, listen more with a discerning mind .  I messed up.  Don't do like me.

LIke many here, I know little to nothing about Bitcoin Gold.  However I have some intuitive projections
FIrst, from when I first heard about Bitcoin Gold I had the feeling it was less scam than a behind-the-scenes maneuver which had intent and goals I did not yet understand 
Now it appears to me that this is in fact an insurance policy.  If Bitcoin Gold mirrors Bitcoin with the only difference being it can be mined by graphic cards rather than asics, well, should the asic miners stage an attack and centralize Bitcoin, we still have our Bitcoin on gpus and can carry on. 
If my understanding is correct, that holding onto Bitcoin Gold is an insurance policy, I will not be trading in those coins in the foreseeable future to buy more Bitcoin. 
This makes a lot of sense to me.  This is not about scamming anybody.  The efforts is to quietly bring on the Ethereum gpu miners who will be left high and dry when Ethereum moves to a proof of stake system instead of mining through proof of work.  This existing network of miners can help secure in a decentralized manner Bitcoin, albeit under the moniker Bitcoin Gold 
This is brilliantly creative thinking and explains the "under the radar" behaviors leading up to the "friendly" fork.  Most other forks are brash and boisterous and want to claim territory from Bitcoin. I don't sense this with Bitcoin Gold 
All this is speculative and not based on known facts.  I may be way off and am open to other interpretations/projections.

I have a question
The Author states "The bet I’m making on Bitcoin is that the number of transactions will continue to increase. So far, the trends think that’s right."
This is the crux of his argument that Bitcoin will succeed, that it is nowhere near done, and that we are building upon this momentum
I want Bitcoin to succeed.  I hodl and have been for years. And I support the fabulous contributions of core and second layer developers.  I am not trying to be contentious in asking my question, or spread FUD.  
My question and concern Id like help with:  while increasingly more and more people are buying and selling Bitcoin, the actual use of Bitcoin for buying and selling stuff has not really increased, and Richard Heart in a video argues it has actually decreased.  (Sorry I cannot cite this immediately).  Others I remember have indicated same, while assuring us this will turn around.  
If commercial use of Bitcoin for transactions of actual goods and services are not increasing, how can the author substantiate his premise?
Is Richard Heart wrong?  
What am I missing?   I must be missing something here.  Can someone help my thinking?  Thanks in advance.

I put in 10% in late 2016 which is now worth the vast majority of my portfolio.   This is the thing:  if you can afford to lose 10% of your portfolio worth with a risky Bitcoin investment, you have to weigh that possibility against the upside potential.  UNlike the dot com bubble, this is not an app or protocol.  Bitcoin is the foundational technology of blockchain.  For this reason alone the upside is tremendous-- Potentially bigger than FB Google Apple combined. For true mega returns, one buys, puts BTC in cold storage like a Trezor and then does not touch it for years, say until after 2021.  Forget about it. Don't trade it and don't worry about the forks.  Just hodl.  Once you start dabbling with it you will be tempted to trade. That's when you can mess up. Forget about it and just hodl.  Don't micromanage it.   Let it fly!  
Yes, perhaps more money could be made micromanaging the forks and trading, but for the vast majority  that is how fools and their money become parted.  We think we can beat the market.  That we can predict outcomes. Don't go there. 
Just hodl!! If anything, just add to the BTC position.  But just hodl through all of it.  In the end you will own your BTC plus additional various Bitcoin altcoins due to forks.  Add them up in 4-5 years and there may be a fortune between it all.  
Don't think there won't be dramatic price drops.  There will be. This is why we hodl.  Discipline. 
Once your target date is hit (for me it is 2020- halving) decide then how you will manage the portfolio
I am older (60) so I will spend some of my BTC wealth to enjoy life and provide gifts to organizations I support.  If you are younger, you may wish to continue to hodl.  Also, be aware there is a social responsibility that comes with wealth creation.  Dont emulate selfish behaviors and what is wrong in this world, but invest in what is right and uplifts us all.  
Good luck everyone!  Remember, we can't take it with us, so use your wealth to make this world a better place!   Be kind to one another.

I have a question
The Author states "The bet I’m making on Bitcoin is that the number of transactions will continue to increase. So far, the trends think that’s right."
This is the crux of his argument that Bitcoin will succeed, that it is nowhere near done, and that we are building upon this momentum
I want Bitcoin to succeed.  I hodl and have been for years. And I support the fabulous contributions of core and second layer developers.  I am not trying to be contentious in asking my question, or spread FUD.  
My question and concern Id like help with:  while increasingly more and more people are buying and selling Bitcoin, the actual use of Bitcoin for buying and selling stuff has not really increased, and Richard Heart in a video argues it has actually decreased.  (Sorry I cannot cite this immediately).  Others I remember have indicated same, while assuring us this will turn around.  
If commercial use of Bitcoin for transactions of actual goods and services are not increasing, how can the author substantiate his premise?
Is Richard Heart wrong?  
What am I missing?   I must be missing something here.  Can someone help my thinking?  Thanks in advance.

Philosophical platitudes, whether true or not, are often received as sloganeering.--  the crypto version of ideological political correctness much of the rest of humanity just does not connect with or "get"
Why is this important?  People are motivated by what moves them
We must meet people where they are. If they are limited and in survival mode or greedy, their self interest and convenience moves them
Bcash or BTC?
Karl Marx understood  that revolutions did not begin and sustain themselves with simply the proletariat but with the efficacy of ideas and messaging of the intelligentsia.

This is too conservative.  I'll tell you why.  2017 was year of the ICOs.  Well that party is over for numerous reasons including SEC/securities oversight issues.  So how to fundraise for projects?  Bitcoin forks!  Mark my word:  there will be numerous Bitcoin forks next year--  maybe dozens?  In any event, each of those forks generates 1:1 coins and additional value while more people invest into Bitcoin wanting new airdropped coins/money (forks of Bitcoin and perhaps even forks of Bitcoin altcoins).  This is when it begins to feel like a bubble of exponential growth as the Bitcoin ecosystem expands.  May start off slowly but by end of year it will become frenetic.  Just my impression.  No hard data to support my thoughts.  All Bitcoin and Bitcoin altcoins combined, $45k+ by end of next year

Depends. I've been looking into this but I have a concern:  once I commit Bitcoin to lend and it goes into multi sig contract and is "securely stored",  say a fork happens.  Who gets the alt coins?

"If Coinbase wants to go to war, things can be made very very dangerous for them. "
Don't be a centralized exchange with attack vectors and piss off the crypto-hacking community with unethical shenanigans is how I interpret this.

There are some real interesting nuances, doublespeak, and more that could be read into the Matrix if not simply accepted one dimensionally and without further critical contemplation.

Tone Vays was not impressed and probably would not have served on a panel.  He thinks the tokens are a scam and Ethereum is a scam.  Checkout his video cryptoscam ethereum    
If the alt coins become the target of the SEC which could legally assert they are securities, and the same for Ether, this could destroy Ethereum and put a lot of people in jail.  Tone Vays said in one of his videos Vitalik is not off the hook.   Tone thinks they could go after many people on securities fraud, as the altcoins may be acting in effect as securities and not complying with current securities transaction laws.  
I don't know the laws and the altcoins vulnerabilities, but this is an interesting position and I'm only reporting what I've heard from Tone Vays. 
While this would not destroy Bitcoin, it would severely damage the cryptocurrency sector and set us back big time.  Bitcoin will have its challenges in the future.  Do not think Wall Street is just going to roll over and watch market share and life  as it has known it slip away.  There will be shenanigans and collusions.  Wall Street has power and influence. It will be used.

So legacy/china coin will have fewer coins outstanding than brand new bip148. 
New bip148 coin won't have as high a price, plus the fees to miners will be less. Hence legacy coin may have higher use/value as a store of value?
Irony is that BIP148 is not supported by miners or Core.  That is what Ive read. 
This does not look hopeful, and "pumping" 148 won't get us where we want to be?  There is only 60 days and hardly any exchanges and wallets are on board.  
What hope is there that 148 will prevail?  
Thinking out loud here.  Few clear answers. 
I just dont want this to turn into a fuckery and show publicly that yes, in fact centralized miners have more power than thought.

I too am trying to grok the connection between tokens or alt coins and Bitcoin, but as I conceive it, all the tokens or altcoins used for whatever transactional purposes will eventually be tied to and correspond to bitcoin as the grounding settlement currency.  Altcoins and tokens would have no transactional value and access to Bitcoin blockchain ledger unless tied to settlement in bitcoin.  This means that various transactions can use altcoins or tokens but in the end be registered as a bitcoin transaction.  Am I on the right  path?  It's kinda like bitcoin is the gold (the store of value) that backs the Bitcoin blockchain.  This is why they say you cannot have a public decentralized and open blockchain without Bitcoin.  Anything less is privatized, a walled garden, with points of failure and insecurity and hacking entry points.   (what the Too Big To Fail banks are working on instead of the public ledger)

@_date: 2016-05-07 20:44:45
Wow.. So tokens can represent ownership of property as well.  So,
my thinking is that they can then be transferred between parties without converting them into bitcoin, and minimal amounts of  bitcoin are expended simply for the transfer and ledger documentation.  
Although in such a scenario the tokens are not redeemed for bitcoin, but certainly could be, the real value in Bitcoin is that untold billions upon billions of transactions will use bitcoin to register on the Bitcoin blockchain.  With such virally high and ubiquitous usage of bitcoin, the value of bitcoin will increase.
Bitcoin:  it's both the glue that binds us and the lubricant for resilient, decentralized and trustless peer to peer  transactions.

I think you are correct, and part of that future of education-- be it via MOOCS or similar-- are real world experiences.  Already my daughter has taken online classes mixed with classroom labs and most importantly, travel to numerous countries to learn new languages and cross-cultural experiences and collaboration.  There is no reason that we cannot become the writers of our own post-secondary/college education based upon our interests and innate talents.  Eventually all of these educational applications can be paid in Bitcoin!  After all, peer-to-peer is global peer-to-peer!

Yes, I think the tokens invite customization and personal branding.  I can even see American Airlines converting and issuing my earned miles into AA tokens I can then convert into additional trips or the purchase of my choice.  The basis and ledger for all this would be Bitcoin.   Bitcoin does not have to be the upfront facing currency used for all transactions.  It just needs to settle all the transactions.  
So think of the possibilities:  Taylor Swift coins, family name coins, company name coins, Cause du Jour coins, etc.  The coins or tokens are used not only in transactions, but as a means for marketing as well, perhaps as gifts or promotions.  
Many many years ago, and maybe some of the oldsters here will remember, whenever you bought groceries or gas, a bunch of stamps were issued.  We saved the stamps and pasted into books and upon completing the pages of the books we could redeem them for items.  Similarly, tokens or custom coins can be used?

@_date: 2017-07-23 19:09:24
Your logical prophesy sounds like three bitcoins could happen-- with one prevailing Bitcoin and two altcoins.  But there is a lot up in the air!!!
I have to laugh when I read through Reddit sometimes.   All this speculation based upon what we think and informationally consume on this forum, a western-based platform that has few South Korean, Singaporean, Chinese, Japanese involvement (all substantial Bitcoin markets).   
Who knows what will happen.  If we think logic will prevail, we know from our own human biological design that logic does not inspire us, but the emotion underlying all behaviors.  
So I have to wonder how all the people not represented in our Reddit forum will be motivated.  I'd say that fear and greed come first, but we also cannot discount the promise behind Bitcoin that many of us find inspirational:  decentralized distributed manner of exchanging and holding value.  The other thing that is hard to gauge is the FUD that may be happening on other Asian-based forums many of us may not frequent.  This may have influence as well. 
In the end, there is little that little ol' me (and maybe you as well) can do to ensure the success of Bitcoin.  So I will think good thoughts and visualize the best outcomes for the highest good for all of us. We are entering dark, uncertain waters..,  I will hope the best outcomes for humanity.   We need to unite in our thinking for the highest good, and celebrate our differences with tolerance. Binary thinking may be good for coding, but its rigidity and intolerance for nuance will kill the resiliency we need to explore options and grow.

Since I am older and do not have the luxury of twenty years to wait until widespread adoption, I will probably wait until it's worth enough in fiat to pay off some debts and perhaps enjoy some of it developing  pro-social, pro-planet projects instead of a crass look-at-me lambo or McMansion. I want to check out of this life having made a difference for others and leaving beautiful memories.  I will, however, hodl to the end of my days.  I have invested for the children in the family as well.  If Bitcoin's worth reaches $1mil equivalency in today's dollars in twenty years, before I die I may instead set up a foundation/trust.

Truly, assuming I live long enuff (baby boomer) I will enjoy watching the platformed vestiges of the industrial era yield to a completely different, decentralized more personally empowering means for transacting, and hence socializing.  Instead of the continuation of the Big Brother paradigm I am very hopeful we can collectively co-create a more peaceful, just and sustainable world.  There will be huge bumps in the road, and our own technology that is self-learning will have to play in order to self-organize.  Destructive play is part of that process... Like a kid who loves to build blocks but has huge glee in knocking them down.  I think the road will be quite bumpy, so while the vision and goal are noble and just, the universal laws of creation and destruction will prevail.

Look at Trezor videos and store off line in cold storage and put into an extremely safe place, such as a safe deposit box (not in Belize).  In 5-10 years you may be able to live off Bitcoin as you may become quite wealthy. Be smart and safe and prudent.

After contemplating on what a "token" could be, they all don't have to be standardized.  In other words, say twenty years from now I want to buy all of Taylor Swifts music directly from her, and by paying her top dollar for these works she throws in a custom Taylor Swift Token.  This Token doesn't have to be a standardized alt coin, right?  Could the token actually be for example a Taylor made custom song just for me registered as mine from Taylor Swift on the Bitcoin blockchain?  All of a sudden new content and currencies are being developed with new markets... all tied to Bitcoin blockchain.  
If so, this token could develop a value of it's own.

Unless there is no market for it.  Maybe the only use of the token is to trade it as a hobby or lark.  If you wanna transfer it you still pay a transfer fee on Bitcoin block chain to register the transfer and ownership on the blockchain.  It remains to be seen what uses and applications and markets for tokens emerge.  Fun to imagine...

I saw it and thought several thoughts:
1.  What a wonderfully empowering advance for people of meager  means.
2.  The use of mobile devices to exchange goods and services was easily adopted, and appreciated by everybody.
3.  The M-pesa CEO/President is making a xxx ton of money and most likely bribing local officials to keep m-Pesa without competition
4.  It's time for Bitcoin!  It will clean up the bribery politics and  fees back into the health of the local economy.
5.  It won't happen without a fight.  Too many vested interests making a ton of money.

Can you imagine the fun he is having reading through comments here and elsewhere?  Look, the guy is tied in closely with JIhan.  They have billions at stake, so creating a little sensationalized attention and appealing to the dreams and greed of the vulnerable masses, he is gonna spin a story about each Bitcoin being worth $2million-plus in three years ONLY if we side with Jihan.  Otherwise it gets killed. Read through his tweets. There is an agenda here.  And as entertaining as it is, it's also street smarts to get as much support for the China coin.   Yes, Mcafee is going to profit.   Just be careful.

The fundamental problem is that while AI can swarm and attack similar to self-organizing systems in nature, what AI lacks from Nature is the ability to feel fear.  This is what concerns me.  Fear is naturally occurring instinct for self-preservation.  It allows the organism or system to back off from a behavior, reconsider, and explore  alternatives to an action.  So CW may wish to seek money for himself by using these techniques, they may in the end destroy all of us?

I am not an economist but a hobbyist, so I may not know what I'm talking about... Wait, most economists don't know what they're talking about... Anyway, it's just my opinion:  I think with the devaluation of currency when they print all sorts of money, issue Quantitative Easing etc, the value of stuff goes down.  It deflates.  That means value of homes etc.  As I understand it,  that is step one.  Everybody's assets become deflated because there is scarce liquidity.  Those who have cash are well positioned.  That's when you want to buy tangible assets For pennies on the dollar that will later inflate.  Then hyper inflation quickly sets in.  The currency's worth loses value very quickly because it simply cannot buy much.  The house you bought for  a song during deflationary times has skyrocketed in price as inflation sets in.  That's great but who has cash to buy it?
These machinations have their own life of unfoldment, so who knows how to time these things. 
The article talks about devaluation first, so I expect that is what the economists fear the most right now. China's real estate market will tumble and lose value.  That is why the Chinese want to get their money out and into safe havens-- real estate in Vancouver, Bitcoin, gold etc. Since we are all interconnected, their economy can help tumble our own, so deflation can set in here as well, followed by high inflation.
This terrible scenario puts many people in harm's way.  Bitcoin can provide a safe haven for many people suffering from a broken economy.

Great convo which has direct bearing on Bitcoin. How?  RSK uses Ethereum open source code so things like smart contracts and other applications can be grounded in Bitcoin.

If Nakamoto Consensus is broken, I assume Bitcoin is broken?   If miners can decide the governance of Bitcoin, what precludes they or the Chinese govt from basically taking over Bitcoin?  If there is a back door to the asic miner rigs and they can be shut down, who owns Bitcoin?  Who in their right mind will build their company upon that foundation, risking their time, investment and reputation on a supposed public distributed ledger which is in reality private?  What makes this system better than a walled garden?   I'm feeling a bit distraught here.  While reddit readers are great, they do not represent the typical international Bitcoin user.

In line with your thinking, this would also motivate the other non-Jihan related miners to hop on board.  Although in so doing, they may preclude theirselves from accessing needed miners which Jihan's company produces. Jeez, what a mess!  And over a year ago I brought up the threat of Chinese centralized mining on this sub and was torn apart because Bitcoin was perfect and my concerns were unfounded. Makes me wonder how we stand a year from now......   we desperately need new mining technology and power efficiencies.  Can solar farms produce enough power for a large mining operation?

Trust?  This is hard core capitalism by folks who are in it for themselves.  This is like yesterday's banana republic campesinos asking Dole Corporation  for a fair, trusting working relationship when the company is exploiting resources, both human and natural, for itself.  Greed and profit rule. To hell with people, relationships, trust or the environment.  The Chinese want their Gucci handbags!
Trust needs to be in the code.  Not sure it can be built organically between cypherpunk and hyper-capitalism unless both parties go to fun camp and learn to play together. Trust is built from deep engagement. The parties dont even know each other, much less engage deeply with one another.

I've lived in military dictatorships and have seen governments take over control and ownership of what once was owned privately.  What makes you think Bitcoin and specifically its mining and transaction processing operations are immune from this, particularly in China, well known for it's authoritarian centralized government?  I'm not saying this WILL happen.  I'm just saying just like a prudent investor diversifies in case one asset class goes down, we should decentralize and diversify mining and transaction processing as a hedge against a black swan event relating to Bitcoin mining.

When the confusion hits and the exchanges are overloaded, you will want to own Bitcoin and not be precluded from participating.   There could be some wild swings.

Great podcast.  The interviewer lacks technical and historic perspective and hence should not try to be more than he is:  a guy asking questions.

I think china has centralized authority--  political and economic and militarily.  Look at what they've done to Tibet!  
That is nit to say other countries or locations don't wield the same powers, but if Bitcoin transaction processing were more evenly distributed, if one region goes down or experiences nationalization of companies (the confiscation of companies by the government), the whole of Bitcoin could recoup and adjust with more resiliency, as other miners elsewhere could pick up the slack or new miners emerge.

Question:  Jeff says Bitcoin is perhaps the TCP/IP of Value.  I get that Bitcoin is foundational but how is the value derived?  Secure, immutable etc?  
How does this Bitcoin blockchain size up against antshares emergent blockchain (china) which is neither POW or POS and supposedly much more friendly?

Agreed.  1992.  The difference this time is that we stand on the shoulders of giants.  Unlike before, Most everyone "gets" the potential of hi technology, and although Bitcoin is a paradigm shift, the onboarding will be dense and swift compared to the first introductory go-around of the information hiway. So while it may be 1992 today, six months from now could easily emerge as 1998!!!!!!!!!!

If you really want to know, assume responsibility and realize you won't be spoon fed by those who really are in the know.  If you are making trade decisions off of whimsical short answers, who knows who is right.   The beauty of Bitcoin is that each of us must step up, educate ourselves and stay open to learning. 
You want instant gratification or answers?  Welcome to the real world.

Did you notice Thiel presented at the Republican Convention?  David Brooks commented he was probably the only true billionaire at the convention (insinuating Trump is not one).  
If Thiel has Trumps ear, I assume Bitcoin is in better hands with Trump than with Hillary
I cannot support either candidate.  What a disaster we are facing....
@_date: 2016-07-12 01:56:25
Yeah... I was wondering about this.  If Bitcoin becomes the store of value and settlement layer, there will be another role for alt coins which may serve as currencies albeit in small or specific economies- be they gaming, banking, etc.  The beauty is if they are pegged Bitcoin they can settle their transactions on the public blockchain.  But what I was wondering about is whether side chains could continue to employ fractional reserve policies, using Citicoins or Goldman Sachs coins, etc.

I dont think many of them are onto the larger paradigm shifting screw the banks thinking.  Perhaps it's all about making money and what's in it for me. Grab while you can. But I may be way out of line and projecting.  Perhaps they have Bitcoin meetups to discuss how best to re-create the future through distributed public blockchain and are actively advocating.

@_date: 2017-06-05 10:03:23
New emergent mining systems will allay current concerns re centralized mining.  Mining is ripe for disruption and I am hoping new technologies will organically resolve this immediate concern.  Once Bitcoin reaches the hyper tipping point and it becomes evident that it is the settlement layer, all sorts of folks will be taking a very hard look at current mining practices.  3D printing may revolutionize the whole mining industry, coupled with emergent sustainable energy technologies. 
Zoom out. 
This Bitcoin ecosystem is fluid. What cannot be immediately compromised and what must be held as sacred is bitcoin's strength as a robust settlement layer.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:45:33
While I think it's important to assert our user-base influence and power, and we are integral to the viability  of Bitcoin, after listening to the interview I want to believe andreas' assessment:  that great majority consensus will be achieved and that we will have a direction for scaling.  I don't want Bitcoin to turn into another altcoin.  We need to become the foundation for settlement for the thousands of altcoins that will inevitably be out there, and live up to being called "digital gold."  This in no way should preclude us from aspiring to more:  we can also complement Ethereum type smart contracts and serve as its settlement layer.  I do think we will need larger blocks eventually, even with SW. I also think this is no longer a fight on technicals but is now more about ego, face and power.  Let's see what other proposals come forth and let's try and resolve this together. I'm backing off on full gung ho advocacy of BIP 148 and will wait to see if we can't be more inclusive and collaborative with all other stake holders. I've zoomed out and realized we really need to be careful and not destroy the larger vision due to immediate frustrations and social media innuendo and hyped political lobbying by parties which have their own interests at heart.  One cannot fight force with force and claim higher ground by destroying the ecosystem.  Let's aspire to higher ground and simply hold out for it and ask for it and work toward it.  The worse that can happen is nothing and Bitcoin stays the same while the ecosystem feels more pinched.   Like siblings fighting in a car, let's find something positive we can focus on and work toward.   If we lose the settlement layer, if Bitcoin loses its reputation as digital gold, we can't build on that for its other applications.  We might as well be another altcoin and use Ethereum as the settlement layer.
