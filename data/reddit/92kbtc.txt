How hands-off is this setup? Do you need to manually launch core after a reboot etc?
Hands-off setup would be ideal for me, just hook it to my modem and be done with it.

Sounds interesting, been thinking about setting up a node on either an old machine or a Rpi, preferrably tucked away in a closet. 
It's important for people to know how low-maintenance and easy it is to support the network this way (given no internet connection restrictions) :)
Thanks OP!

Energy is not wasted, it is expended to secure Bitcoin. I see the merits of PoS, but I'm not convinced

Alternatively: Let in-game money lose value as time progresses, let transfers take up to 3 in-game work days, just include every aspect of fiat systems in there, and crypto will make naturally make sense.

The danger with this is that inflation is like a bottle of ketchup. You're slapping the bottom of the bottle and only drops come out until BAM, you drowned your meal in ketchup.

How is Bitcoin addictive? Price volatility and 24/7 markets are factors, maybe?

Lol, govt have to figure out how to eat while in a straitjacket. They stand to lose some weight, that's for sure... A good thing
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:42:49
Good points. I typically use different addresses for each tx, but I wonder how hard it would be to do some analytics to match addresses to public keys and finally to identity.
I mean, some ways to buy btc require (verified) bank accounts, which are obviously linked to identity. I feel that in theory, the govt should be able to figure out I have/had at least some amount of btc from the traces I have left here and there.
I'm just thinking, if govs figure out a way to (fairly) tax btc like they tax fiat, that would only accelerate adoption, right? I feel like there could be a potential win-win scenario for both govt and btc
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:28:42
I remember reading something about some central bank (Finnish?) already running analytics or something... I mean, there's potential money in it for them, there's a clear incentive
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:01:01
Agreed, thanks.

Well, the original idea was to make it in Dutch to have a go-to source of information for friends and family who were intimidated by the vast amount of scattered English info on bitcoin. Making a translation is always an option, but I feel that there is plenty of information on bitcoin in English (like the beginner sticky on this sub)

Yeah I guess ditching USB would create such a big mess... if an alternative comes along, it would probably have to coexist for some time. Still then, odds are that the newer alternative would be abondoned in favour of well functioning existing solutions
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:29:44
I'll check it out, thanks
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:16:24
First of all, I ment to say that it doesn't take a whole lot to figure out who has what amount of btc from breadcrumbs of info. Even the govt could prob do that. Not saying that they **should**, in that sense of the word.
Second, I'm talking from the govt's perspective: even when we agree that they are self-serving, it would still be in their interest to work with btc rather than trying to fight it. If we treat the price as a depreciation of fiat instead of an appreciation of bitcoin, govt would have to print zimbabwan amounts of dollars to make up for lost tax revenue. This is in case of Bitcoin reeeeally taking off.

Split your stash in an amount that will likely cover most routine transactions, and an amount to put in your 'savings account' 
Put your 'pocket-change' bitcoin in a mobile wallet, and get a Ledger or Trezor for your savings. 
Don't worry too much about losing the hardware wallet. They're secure and can be recovered on a new one. But for this you need the recovery words. These are critical and need to be stored offline (on paper/wood/metal/whatever) and backed up.  Never online or digitally.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:56:38
Not in a safe, but stored at several places. Do whatever you are comfortable with. Give a copy to a close family member, bury it in your backyard or put it in a safety deposit box... In case you trust someone else with these words, you could think about putting words in reversed order, or switch the first and last one. 
The thing with Bitcoin is that the burden of securing the coins is on the user. You don't have to comply to anything for anybody. Do whatever makes you sleep at night. There's no perfect solution, but many options are good enough. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:29:13
It's a good solution for the time being. When a better one/another standard comes along, you simple switch to that. Everything is bound to be rendered obsolete sometime, no reason to stay sidelined for that. 
Otherwise, consider paper storage

I think we can agree that every move on the ‘trust’-spectrum from ‘total trust’ towards ‘total trustlessness’ is great, right? Complete trustlessness is the aim, but it’s hard if not impossible to achieve.
Running your own full node is a step in right direction, your own hardware wallet too. I’m quite comfortable using stress-tested audited open-source software. Don’t forget that the bounty for finding a flaw in any of these things is astronomical.
How do you know that a restaurant is not poisoning you unless you perform a chemical content analysis on your meal? And if it turns out there was no poison, you’ll have to order the meal again because you ruined the last one by analysing it. Maybe the chef poisoned your second order. You’ll never be able to eat someone else’s cooking.
In software, you can, because there are biochemists checking and eating exact copies of what you’re eating. So if they’re good and say it’s alright, you’re probably good. Being a biochemist yourself is better, but opportunity costs etc. so you verify some things by proxy. For hardware, it is harder as it is more analogous to meals than to software.
“Don’t trust. Verify.” is the goal. A lot of people simply “Trust. Don’t verify” across the board and can easily do better by being a little more vigilant and taking some responsability for their BTC. The goal is financial sovereignty and it is 1:1 related to the degree by which you verify rather than trust. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:42:21
Most hardware wallet run open source software. I don’t have the skill to audit the code entirely by myself, so it’s more verification by proxy. Many expert programmers are ok with the way hardware wallets run, or actively try to find flaws which get patched. So I ‘trust’ hardware wallets because people more skilled than I do. Not ideal, but good enough imo. Especially when it’s open source.

From the EPS readme: 
It is an implementation of the Electrum server protocol which fulfills the specific need of using the Electrum wallet backed by a full node, but without the heavyweight server backend, for a single user. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, mnemonic recovery phrases and so on can still be used, but connected only to the user's own full node.
Different means, same end. I’m not denying that there are multiple options, just highlighting the one that works for me.
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:28:19
Build your own Trezor. It’s open source.
 
But you need to order the parts from some place. So you trust the manufacturer/seller. It goes on to the point where you’re building your own chips, display, etc.
Trezor is sold ‘empty’, meaning you have to install the latest firmware before you can start to do anything with it, through the bootloader. In the process, the bootloader wipes the device before moving on with new firmware, and checks signatures for the software to be installed.
Then again, you could build your own air-gapped never-online computer exclusively for signing transactions and broadcast them through another machine.

If you use the latest server.py it will work, problems with Electrum 3.2 have been addressed
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:59:09
Fair enough, adjusted the first paragraph. Can’t seem to edit the title on mobile, however. I might create a dedicated post about ElectrumX in the future if I get around to setting it up properly.
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:18:46
Electrum Personal Server is not a malware version of Electrum, it's a program allowing you to use the REAL Electrum with your full node, rather than using default public servers and exposing your public key and activity to them.
As I mentioned in the beginning of my post:
'...It allows you to connect your hardware wallet to your own full node **through Electrum**, meaning you can have offline private keys while having your own node verify your transactions.'
I assumed readers to be familiar with/users of Electrum already. Obviously, you need to be absolutely sure to run the legit Electrum from one of the sources you mentioned. Type in the .org-address in your browser yourself, if you don't trust the links.

Thanks for your vigilance, tho.
