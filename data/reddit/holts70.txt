The NSA has never stopped a large scale terrorist attack, they admitted that themselves, a simple Google search will show you that.
I'm not willing to sacrifice my freedoms for what amounts to "the Boogeyman"
The real Boogeymen are the pedos writing the laws, dodging taxes based on loopholes they created themselves, and laughing all the way to the bank, while instilling fear in the general population about Eastasia or whatever other scary terrorists they learned about when they used 1984 as a fucking playbook instead of a warning

That seems really reductive.  
And frankly, if someone comes up with a good plan to deal with billionaire elites diddling kids and killing the inconvenient witnesses after they get arrested, I'm all over it.  I'm not smart enough to enact global change myself, so I'll just keep talking about it.  But at least people are aware now that it's a thing.  That's better than nothing.

Don't forget about the TSA!
All about that control, and all about that money

Maybe the bigger issue is that the terrorists, child traffickers, pornographers, and the people making the biggest shady anonymous offshore financial deals are the people in control of the world and who write the laws that the proles have to obey, and they can ignore
Missing the forest for the trees is my response to your whole argument.  You do raise valid concerns and hopefully some day we can find a solution, but Bob next door using TOR, using encryption, and making anonymous transactions isn't the shit that keeps me up at night, because he isn't the real problem.  And peeking into his business without justification because he might be breaking the law is the very definition of a dystopian nightmare.  Yet mass surveillance has been enacted without even having a popular vote.  You've actually got 90% of your wish, the government is in your shit, and encryption is one of the last bastions of actual anonymity we have.  Check out Snowdens book, Permanent Record.  It's very illuminating.
