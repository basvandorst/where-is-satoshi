At a minimum, $.02/hr for the VM and about $.11 per GB transferred out. At 13GB/day, you'll be in the $60/month range without factoring in disk I/O.

1) OK, assuming you had some other way of seeing the blockchain but not being able to transmit on that same link, that might work. With no access to the blockchain, you would never know if your transmission was received or not.
2) If it's filtered, I think we're back to assuming you can't see the blockchain either, so we're back to trying to tunnel out. If a government or ISP ever felt so threatened by bitcoin that they somehow managed to block all access to it, I'm not sure enough regular people would be using it to make it worth running around with radios and receivers haha.
3) You're trusting whoever is running the radio receivers. Even in the public place, you need some internet connection to see the blockchain, and you're restricted to being in the general area of places you have physical access to. You could possibly have more local variation by putting the signed transactions on a flash drive, going to a library, and transmitting them from there. 
Again, not shooting down your idea. Unfortunately, I'm good at thinking of roadblocks :(

I don't understand. I realize how this could possibly be useful for submitting transactions in an area where internet is unavailable, though the receiver wouldn't be able to confirm it. 
As far as privacy, staying in one place is going to result in transactions that are generally from the same handful of nodes, and in the general area. Wouldn't it be easier to just transmit the transaction to a trusted node somewhere else, or a VPN/tor? The radio doesn't really seem hide anything unless you're on the move with no internet and need to create transactions without verifying them. And even then it doesn't make sense because you're not just going to keep spamming the same transaction because you don't know whether it has been picked up or not.
It's an interesting thought though!

Even if they did care about bitcoin transactions and saw them on an exit node, that doesn't give away the source of the transaction. They may be able to read it, but all they can do is see the node that forwarded it to their exit node. With enough inside nodes and info on the habits they're looking for, someone might be able to find the source they're looking for, but it would probably require less time and effort to find the guy walking around the park with a laptop and HAM radio. That'll raise suspicion with pretty much anyone. Given an infinite amount of resources, anyone can find anything. Your private key could be brute forced. Everything is a balance of finite resources and benefits.

Alright, claims aside, I've got a question about Electrum. Let's say that you use it as an offline wallet. By default, it generates 5 receiving addresses. After one receives a transaction, it goes in the "used" category, and a fresh address is generated. So, 2 questions:
1) It should still be safe to re-use the used addresses, right?
2) The 6th address that's generated isn't generated in the offline version, because it doesn't know about the transaction that took place. Does this end up being a problem? The transactions need to be generated on the online computer anyway, and the offline one should be able to derive the private key, but does it do that automatically or is there a step that I'm missing?

Well, I'll keep waiting on that small transaction. Thanks for the advice.
Though, I did just do a .8BTC test as well. I thought it was going fine, it had over 70% confirmations and then suddenly switched to 0% - 1 Node. I've seen several posts about blockchain having issues today, should I just wait on this one as well? I'm not terribly concerned with .007btc floating around, but .8 is a little more worrisome.

Looking at the transaction on Blockchain, it shows:
&lt;source key&gt; (0.07008 BTC - Output)
		&lt;destination key&gt; - (Unspent) 0.00708065 BTC
        &lt;source key&gt; - (Unspent) 0.06299935 BTC
So it looks like it took my initial transaction and tried to break it up. The transaction summary shows:
 Confirmations
Unconfirmed Transaction!
Double Spend
No Double Spend Detected
Transaction Fee
0 BTC
Network Propagation
It's just sitting at the bottom of my blockchain wallet, which is strange because it wasn't the first transaction. Also, the balance next to it just shows (-0.00708065 BTC) instead of showing what the balance would be if that number was subtracted from the balance in the wallet at the time it was done. I may have initiated this transaction before the initial one was confirmed?
Any ideas? Should I still try a backup wallet?

Don't forget that you have to pay for electricity, your GPU sucks down more watts at full load than idle, and the heat will reduce the lifetime of the system.

If I got a tip for every time one of these showed up...
If it's not a bubble, you'll kick yourself for not jumping on. If it is a bubble, you'll kick yourself for jumping on. If I could say with 100% certainty whether or not it was a bubble, I would expect you to pay me a lot for my advice.
If you want to play the game, sitting on the sidelines is not the way to do it

Both investments are equal. Stop thinking "I can't even buy a whole bitcoin". You're putting $100 into a hole and hoping something comes out. If the bitcoin is growing in value, it doesn't matter than you didn't have 10 of them, you put $50USD into it and it will grow at the same rate. That being said, you're free to put some money on Litecoins if you want to. It's your money. If you think those will grow at a faster rate, then that's what you'll want to put your money on.

What makes your cooperative different than other dividend paying groups? Any pictures of your current setup or proof that you have more equipment on the way?

Put your wallet.dat in %AppData%/Bitcoin
Hope that helps!

Before you buy bitcoins, read up on how they work or you're just going to lose them. A paper backup means you store the private key on paper. It has nothing to do with the balance.

ATI has OpenCL, so you can write GPU programs for both. The cards are simply built differently. See [this post](

The .8BTC is getting confirmations slowly but surely. The .007BTC transaction, however... interesting. Blockchain is the only service that has a record of it. I exported the private keys from my blockchain wallet and imported them into Multibit, and it doesn't show that that transaction exists. Doing getrawtransaction in Bitcoin-QT yields nothing, as does searching for the hash on BlockExplorer. I tried re-importing my private keys onto Blockchain, but that did nothing to erase the transaction it still thinks exists. I'm confused, is it still just taking it's time to propagate from Blockchain? It just seems like it should at least exist somewhere, even as an unconfirmed transaction with 0 confirmations.
Go figure, as I'm asking about it, it disappears from existence. I have the correct balance though, so all's good :) Thanks again

Waste. FTFY
You're upping your cpu wattage by at least 8x by having it do processing instead of idling. You're paying more for electricity than you're earning. If you're so tight on cash that you can't put $20 in, go to faucets and watch ads if you want free bitcoins. Don't dig yourself into a worse hole.

(Or, I think it's C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin)
OR add a -datadir flag to your Bitcoin-QT shortcut and point it to the directory with your wallet.dat (you might also have to re-download the chain if you don't move it from the AppData folder).

You also have to factor in fees for trades and withdrawals.
