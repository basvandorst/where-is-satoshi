God damn did someone seriously just make that

What has the special counsel show us so far?
Those two guys plead guilty to charges...... but those charges are far removed from any sort of collusion.
"We have come down quite a way from the hyperventilation about Russia “hacking the election” a year ago."
"All the conspiracy theorists have so far are a few Facebook ads that can’t credibly be shown to have changed even one vote."
"Flynn was fully in his rights making the call to Kislyak. Despite the best efforts of the anti-Trumpers, it is still not illegal to talk to Russians. Even Democratic former CIA director and Defense secretary Leon Panetta said it was a “stretch” to say these contacts broke the law. "
This is from a relatively left publication too. Basically saying the things you believe are bullshit. Any comment?

He is definitely against centralization of power. Theres what.... Kushner in the cabinet? Hes against the EU and the UN which are centralized sources of governance on a level much higher than having his son and son in law working for him. We are talking about governing structures of small people dictating laws and policies for millions of people, some of which the lawmakers have never even stepped foot into their lands. He also gave huge tax breaks which decentralizes out monetary supply even more, as it is now not being filtered through the centralized federal government. 
I think youve accepted many many false premises. After all youre the one crying "russia russia!"

Who is honestly buying bitcoin to use it as currency? I know im not. I know others arent. Theyre buying as a store of value so they can then cash it into another currency widely used for transactions in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:07:22
Is that all you have? Lol..... you know a person has no argument when they have to resort to calling out account ages......? As if the age of the account has any bearing on the individuals argument? 
Jesus man you should read some of youre own bullshit. Still waiting for your reply on my other comment.

Dont touch my car

Theres like tons of exchanges bro
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:01:31
Whats your point
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:22:00
Yeah it was bizarre to refer to communism as grass roots when its quite the opposite. Everything else makes lots of sense tho

Hey bud. You might want to be careful being such a douche on the internet with a 7 year old account history. Just a quick glance shows youre a blacksmith who is obsessed with going to burning man..... theres pictures with license plates in them, etc..... if you piss off the wrong person you really wouldnt be too hard to track down if they really wanted to. Perhaps you should consider starting a new account if youre gonna be calling people retards and stuff. 
Its kinda scary when you start getting PMs from some random psycho and they know more about you than you think is possible.

Libertarian would be everyone freely choosing to give a portion of their own production up for the commune or community.
Communism would be a centralized power forcing everyone to give up the fruits of their labor to the commune. The labor is usually forced too.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:16:59
I dont see how you can like crypto and decentralization but also hate trump who is against centralization of powers
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:44:50
Hes heavily criticized the UN and the EU...... he also gave huge tax cuts which decentralizes our monetary supply more. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:58:37
Dont you need to have enough BTC to cover your position?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:20:40
Communism isnt grass roots. Communism is where everyone is ordered to do certain jobs or tasks by a centralized power, which gathers the product and redistributes it. That is much less grass roots than capitalism where every individual is responsible for their own production and lives or dies by their own efforts
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:48:59
You sure put a lot of personal information on the internet for anyone to find for someone who cares about security. Pretty careless actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:49:26
The intranet

Scarcity and the fact that theres already a huge market with the entry point being bitcoin. It can still be used to tramsfer large sums of money and it has a historical record of transactions going back farther than most digital currencies. Its poised to be the backing of the entire crypto market in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:35:26
Can you explain why tho....?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:44:11
Capitalism is a more decentralized means of production than communism. In capitalism people live or die by their own merit, as it is in the natural world. In communism even if a capable person produces nothing, they are compensated.

And now youre going into conspiracy land again. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:49:23
Will they be held accountable for this blatant scam attempt?
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:07:20
Who is he
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:03:50
Yeah they tanked. Ill buy them off ya for 100$
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:31:22
No it isnt. Id rather not have a Ferrari then be obese
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:03:12
I love how people say "Mt. Gox" as if it was named after a mountain..... when in reality it stands for "magic the gathering online exchange"
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:36:01
Never knew that thanks
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:27:09
Dont sound too bad to me
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:11:13
Maybe it just did crash the price, but that wasnt the intention. Maybe the intention was simply to sell and make money
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:40:18
Thanks expert

Socialism is just increasing centralization of society. A centralized entity collects money and resources and distributes it as they see fit. It has the same pitfalls as any centralized system.
