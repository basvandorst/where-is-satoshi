The value of the bet was the millionare's net worth (let's say $2,500,000). So, they were going to cut the deck of playing cards and each pull out a card.
If the millionaire wins (ex: Let's say he pulls a "king" and the billionaire pulls a "ten"), he doubles his net worth to $5,000,000. 
If the billionaire wins (ex: Because he pulled a "seven" and the millionaire pulled a "five"), he takes the millionaire's whole worth and leaves him with nothing.

Ditto. Probably less than 1% can say anything substantial about it. Worldwide, I imagine less than 0.5% have heard of it.

Simple and clean. I like it.

From a support person at CoinBase (after I tired making a purchase):
"The limit you're seeing is Coinbase's daily limit being reached, not your personal limit. Sometimes the Coinbase site itself will run into a daily rolling limit on purchases or sales if there is an exceptional amount of activity in the bitcoin markets. We put up this temporary pause to make sure that we have enough funds to accommodate the transfer orders being created. This should be a rare exception rather than the general rule however. There is no specific time of the day where this limit starts - it's on a 24 hour rolling basis. It might be best to check in at 6am or 7am Eastern Standard Time tomorrow. Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you - we know this can be frustrating. This is something we're working on as we speak."

The conversation continues to progress and evolve. This is an important step to mainstreaming.

Math Club, thus we have flexibility. The other class is a high school level all-around class (mixture of statistics, applied math, etc - it's perfect).

The learning objective would be to introduce them to the idea of digital currency and how it's similar/different to what they are used to calling money.
