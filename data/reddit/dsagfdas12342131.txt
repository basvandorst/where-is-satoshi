yes, that's one way. there are also exchanges such as  and  that can be linked to your bank account. you will need to supply scans of your ID (passport/drivers license) and proof of address (utility bill) - but the prices are better than on localbitcoins and you don't have to worry so much about getting scammed. there is also  which is good for small amounts.

pretty much none.. you should just use it for something else and use a cash deposit to buy btc via localbitcoins instead. looking for someone to take it will be a pain, and they'll charge you a rip off exchange rate anyway.

I don't know really.. but it's similar to how apple pay works. I guess that Google Pay/Apple Pay do not make use of the visa/mastercard network to bill the cards - but rather cut them out and bill the banks directly somehow.. that would make sense since they probably want to take those profits. But that's entirely supposition on my part.. the bottom line though is that although you do type your card details into the app during the signup process it doesn't work anything like a normal debit card payment.
I think there must be some limitation in the android OS or hardware that prevents just anyone from writing a payments app - otherwise there would be loads of them already. Perhaps your application needs to be blessed by google - signed with a specfic cert to allow it to access the necessary NFC hardware? I imagine it would be possible using a rooted phone, but rooted phones and payment apps don't really go together.
  has been saying (here and on twitter) about how they have made one, but it's not available to the public yet - and I'm guessing it's because they can't actually release it.
edit: it's  not plutos.it

Android Pay only works with specific bank cards where google has an agreement with the bank in place - you need to call your bank and explicitly authorize it. So yea that isn't possible yet.
