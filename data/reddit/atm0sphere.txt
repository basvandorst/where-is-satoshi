unless I'm mistaken, you're talking about a trading halt. the cool down period happens in traditional markets (sometimes) when there's a massive sell off because it allows the traders time to eat and gather their marbles before they start selling again.
sometimes they halt/curb etc. (they have different meanings for each word officially, apparently) trading for an hour, sometimes they close for a bit longer.

there's ALWAYS cash floating around to stick people in jail, especially if it's for drugs / ee-lee-gul way-b sites!

there is economic data, there is falsifying economic data, and then there is Chinese economic data. it's not exactly like they're doing fantastic right now (i.e. ghost cities) and as their biggest trade partner it's unlikely they want to outright destroy the U.S. right now.
it won't happen overnight but it's very likely a larger basket of currencies (the dollar is I believe 65-70% of the world reserve if I'm not mistaken) or entirely new currency, could theoretically insulate other nations from the fumbling the U.S. government, and thereby the dollar, which have clearly demonstrated all the symptoms of bumbling lately.
this would mean that the value of the dollar would decline, and the price (in USD) of a bitcoin would go up, but who really knows.
let's say it's 2013 vs 2016, so in theory:
$3.50 for a gallon of gas (2013)
$14 for the same gallon of gas (2016)
this assumes that inflation from now until then has been ~400%
let's assume bitcoin is 150 USD/1 (2013)
does that translate to a literal 600USD/1 (2016) new price point? obviously not, but as there's no precedent/case study/easy way to put this, who the fuck knows! in a clusterfuck scenario where this happens overnight, and a few years pretty much translates to overnight, I'd be significantly more worried about how I'm getting my next meal then the value of any BTC if I'm in the states.
then again, I have no skin in this game. also, anyone touting to 'know' anything ahead of time and has skin in the game *could* be doing it for their own benefit, but I've seen some of Fulfords stuff as a frequenter of myself, and I don't remember being wholly moved in either direction by it.
