Seems like a pretty raw deal to me. Especially with Halong Dragonmint Miners and some others coming to compete with Bitmain.

Jameson is a rockstar as far as I'm concerned. He rises above the vitriol and posts very data focused and nuanced views. I really like following his twitter / always use his resources page and suggest them in addition to the original whitepaper when people ask me about getting involved these days.

I started by being more interested in the money and the potential political implications and then over time my eyes were opened to the technology and became a long term believer.

They should put the sign on it, "SODL"! :P

The real question is, why sell at all?

He's also said/alluded multiple times to holding BTC to 'diversify'.

Was just about to say! Now for removing "Website 2"

I thought they’re now embracing SegWit with some small changes? I could be wrong but remember seeing it posted somewhere. They’re just saying obviously that it’ll be a *better* version of SegWi. ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:28:37
I just can't even with him though. His Facebook ads are so atrociously bad that I don't trust what he says by default. Even when it fits my bias. (e.g. BTC going to $1M per or more)
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:13:49
Very neat find, thanks for sharing!

I experience the same symptom when analyzing most TA on BTC's potential... 
If it lasts longer than 4 hours though, make sure to go [see a doctor]( ;-)

I'm with Andreas on this point. Taking the existing legacy system and simply making it more efficient is not interesting or exciting. The romance, as you call it, is the most important / innovative part of Bitcoin. The first world may not necessarily need these functions, until they do. But much of the world does, desperately. (Immutability, censorship resistance, borderless, decentralized, etc.)

I like Erik Voorhees and his team (people behind KeepKey) but I've had a fantastic experience with the Trezor, and can't recommend it enough. Also Trezor's CTO seems to be solidly in support of Core and the roadmap in place. Their coin splitting tool is simple and easy to use. They were unaffected by the Meltdown / Spectre hacks. I recommend them very much.

It's getting so out of hand IMO. Especially coming from CNBC... I don't get it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:00:22
Dash's beginnings / history is just a tad too *[shady]( for me... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:21:52
Which niche would Dash succeed at that Bitcoin doesn't already do better? (Esp. when LN, etc. is implemented and used widely)
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:06:04
I never said I trust CNBC... I don't trust any mainstream sources mostly at all. Don't trust, verify. ;)  I'm saying the propaganda being pushed is insane. It's nothing new, obviously.
What I don't get is why so many seemingly smart people are falling for it, aside from trust in a figure or ignorance of the technical facts behind the BTC vs. BCH. It's not even a discussion for most who are aware of all the implications. 
Hopefully tech./philosophical merit and talented devs win over the general public in the end, rather than slick marketing / propaganda.

There's a new miner coming that had a solid endorsement from Adam Back. ( )

Apparently that quote was very likely fabricated / attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild but there is no proof he actually said it. ([link]( 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:05:00
Anyone I've given BTC to I've also set up with a Trezor for it.

Andreas is such a fantastic and passionate speaker in this space. He's helping to spread the love and understanding of Bitcoin in the most interesting and eloquent ways. He truly deserves all the success he's going to have. I became a Patron and still feel like I'm underpaying him for his value. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:49:06
This post was one of the most humble and honest things I've ever read on the internet. I feel indebted to Andreas for the work he's done largely for free, it's incredible the amount of effort he put in these years to spreading knowledge and awareness of Bitcoin. I'm sure he'll long be remembered as one of the most critical people behind Bitcoin, and this post just endears him to many that much more. &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:09:30
This is awesome to know.. That makes me even more excited for the 1GB fiber to the home I'm about to get in my new place. :P
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:09:22
Don't trust. Verify. 
Andreas is right, focus on the tech. and don't get emotionally charged by the propaganda. And HODL through it all. &lt;3

I plan on setting up a miner as soon as the Halong Miners are available and definitely will be going with Slush Pool. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:30:31
Oh good point -- for sure, I also plan on setting up a couple of those new Dragonmint miners and also setting up a dedicated full node as well so I'll be making sure I've got the best router setup possible. :) I wanna help decentralize and secure the network further and also earn some more BTC! ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:08:53
Understood, I was more addressing the mining centralization point. :) 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:57:31
Really well said. To the future!

Everything I've seen Voorhees say shows he takes a pretty thoughtful and intentionally balanced approach to almost any topic, especially the scaling debate. He's one of the best people in crypto, and I don't think it's smart to try and denigrate a person who's done so much for Bitcoin / crypto because of a simple mistake. A mistake, by the way, which he then had his team correct immediately. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:02:41
Those are serious bull riding skills.

I got downvoted for saying this a few months ago: "Everything I've seen Voorhees say shows he takes a pretty thoughtful and intentionally balanced approach to almost any topic, especially the scaling debate. He's one of the best people in crypto, and I don't think it's smart to try and denigrate a person who's done so much for Bitcoin / crypto because of a simple mistake.

I still believe it. Voorhees is a quality guy.

Sorry, I'm new to Bitcoin... what does 1PT mean?
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:20:32
Ah, makes sense. I would have understood that then. lol I was confused by PT. All I remember about PT is physical agony in the Army... ;-) 
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:31:19
That would be amazing.
