Don't think so. I'm aware that was my downfall, but still a shitty lesson to learn D:
edit: Haven't had the courage to buy since...

Do I count as the last 5?

I received a small bitcoin tip once before, but I have literally no idea how to claim it...
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:22:47
I bought at $58... Got stolen at $250 :/
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:48:30
I don't have any suggestions, and it does indeed work well! I dunno, it was just kind of expected, ya' know? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:20:14
Small gains/risk. Just trying it out tbh.

I guess this thread is dead?

I'm not a back-end developer, but I'm a front-end designer.

I'm working on an Australian version of this. However it could very well become an international thing. 
Just searching for capital at this point. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 02:07:04
Nope, all good so far. 
Also; if you need a designer, let me know ;D
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:30:42
I like that you can just set and forget about that. I bought some, watched them attentively, then BAM. Stolen :/
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:41:58
Nor did I. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:31:01
No idea. Had them stored in a wallet on  log in one day, having lost $1700 :/ or 6 btc
@_date: 2013-06-17 06:27:52
Left my coins in a blockchain.info account, and they all 12 of them (or like... 11.8 or something) got stolen. At the time, that was $2200 worth :/
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:28:24
Okay, I contradicted myself a little... A lot.
But you see what I mean.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:34:34
It's really shitty. I was devastated, and haven't had the confidence to buy more. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:56:42
Wish I was trolling. I only lost 8-ish coins, but still. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:58:01
How does one lock a wallet?
@_date: 2013-03-22 03:58:11
Designer here, and I'd use it!
@_date: 2013-07-05 11:19:14
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:35:21
How, from a tip do I send the coins to my regular account?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:58:42
Not trolling. I only lost 8-ish coins, but it was a lot to me, someone who got in like a month ago.

Nice video, and I love Clubbed to Death, it's just very cleche on "edgy" videos now-a-days... 
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:20:38
Nice idea, but I feel you could get more if you change the design to be a little less... bootstrappy. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:29:26
"It dropped $2, SELL SELL SELL"
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:08:33
How does one get a tip? Or is it some kind of rouse? 
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:41:23
People are selling, which is bringing the price down. 
So yes, I think people should hold fort, harden the fuck up and stop selling as soon as something fluctuates a little. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:40
Be scared man... check it :/ 
2 factor auth everything
edit: seems I had forgotten how many I had, it was around 8.
