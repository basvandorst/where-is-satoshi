Ripple = banks. Banks = older than BTC. You are correct

Really limiting yourself with pointing out those names &gt;.&lt; You have many better options to associate with Bitcoin.

"International sanctions against countries such as Syria have affected their access to U.S. dollars, limiting their ability to import food."
Would this be an added concern for countries such as the US that love to heavily sanction others? Haven't heard much about the fear of BTC routing around sanctions before, seems like another valid use case, albeit possibly controversial.

Build your crypto portfolio as a hedge fund manager would manage a portfolio and you'll be able to minimize risk and see consistent gains without the need to 'get lucky on the right coin'.
This means choosing percentages based on perceived market conditions, sticking with a specific grouping of 6-15 coins and rebalancing your portfolio either once a month or on large fluxuations of an individual coin.
I've been testing HODL theory vs hedge fund theory for the past few months and I've seen some very appealing statistics for a diversified approach. However, as long as you're not in BitQy right now you can't really go wrong.

Speaking of, has anyone actually FOUND a 'cryptocurrency profficient' CPA or financial advisor? I have been asking around and have yet to find a CPA or financial advisor in my area that knows anything about cryptocurrwncies past what bitcoins current price is...

Why not wait until at least $880?

The amount of time BTC has been at $1,000 has been an incredibly small window. It was a bad time to buy before and a decent time to buy a year ago. Best time to buy (disregarding pre Mt Gox) was around $200-$400 for many, many months September 2014 - January 2016

I've bought quite a few Steam games with BTC. Looking at what that value is currently, I overpaid for a lot of video games and that makes me sad. However, .... there really is no upside... I could have saved my BTC and used PayPal there is no reason to purchase things with BTC until all 21M coins are mined IMHO.

$7,800 bottom? Bet you wish you waited a bit longer. Sry man, just wait it out... maybe...

Honestly I have had no trouble with Coinbase and it has been simple and smooth for the past 5 months.

This image has the charts for NASDAQ and BITCOIN reversed...
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:05:41
Can't the wallet owner simply sell the stolen Tethers on an exchange before the hard work is finalized?

Currently sitting back at $7294, massive sell walls. Can't say whether this is 'good' or 'bad' for the price until it settles. No one has a real estimate of how much money propped the price up in anticipation of S2X coins.

I've never had any issue with Coinbase, however, Coinbase is all I have ever used. Is that a problem? They have a simple interface and I use Bitcoins primarily through a mobile interface.

If this really is the high point 'bull trap' would now be a good time to take some profit ?
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:46:51
You are exactly right. This is real time of a small wallet that shows the exact image and timing you mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:48:23
If you are right, we've go a lot further to go down.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:21:38
I should stop touching this portfolio, I really just want to see how close the waves represent the bubble classic bubble pattern.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:20:20
This could absolutely be the point right after the 'bull trap' on it's way to 'return to normal'.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:07:03
 I thought you might be curious so here is that same portfolio now. Starting to split from the classic bubble pattern, but still possible for a severe drop very soon. Note that I did add another $100 to the portfolio and that's what %50 of the recent spike was.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:09:11
Starting to level out only halfway through the largst expected dip depicted on your original image. Also that portfolio i showed wasn't BTC, but it was ETH, XRP and SC. If a portfolio comes out of the bubble pattern early would that be considered a good sign?
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:49:27
Glad this was your response. I sent 1/4 of my portfolio to USD a few hours ago because of the indicators we have been seeing. For the time being.
Maybe I should have exchanged more crypto into USD, but what I traded equals about 60% of all USD I have put into crypto in the last 6 months.

You made an incredibly rash and uninformed choice. Everyone in Bitcoin would tell you it is a risky investment. If you needed the cash to live on there was zero reason to take that gamble. On top of that, if you were really reading a single thread on Reddit you'd know better than use the exchange as a bank account, every member here will tell you repeatedly not to leave your money on ANY exchange. Hold the private key to hold the coins.
Calling bullshit.
