Holy fuck if anyone reading this buys/sells bitcoin based on the direction of the bitcoin roller coaster gif on please get the fuck out of all financial markets
Also by posting this gif, you're saying you are advising users on what to do with their bitcoin, which you are definitely in no position to do.

What happened?
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:48:56
No one posts this when it's up
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:01:24
Kinda looks like Carlton on the right

He's talking about options, not shorts.

What is the point of this post
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:07:14
Whoever made the first picture is actually retarded
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:14:23
I'm 23 and have one. Old, traditional companies still do them.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:41:17
Really.. even if the only currency was bitcoin there would still be investing companies..
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:34:30
Okay, what happens when it's not a US org doing it?
You'll still have people here crying that there are downsides to what they were asking for the whole time

If Bitcoin et al. fail, it will be because the general public wanted to use them as stocks, not currencies. Bragging about how much money you've made (and lost) investing in cryptos only encourages this.

Eh. Every time "bitcoin" beats the forks the price jumps 
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:20:46
Hahahaha now you want regulation
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:53:14
Juxtaposing negative opinion piece with cherry picked price quote to call the former "fake news"
Fuck off. This sub will upvote anything that sucks BTC's dick and makes fun of non-BTC dick suckers

Someone having body dysmorphia makes you lose respect for them?
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:30:19
Hurts the legitimacy of bitcoin to the general public when everything is confusingly separated like this
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:56:25
thank you for telling us the facts, time traveler
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:10:16
yeah that was Jamie's plan

Hm? GPU prices are at MSRP again.

Fuck John McAfee

That's an expensive gift for a kid that doesn't have the capacity to give a fuck about it or you
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:17:07
And?
