So make sure I have at least 100,000 satoshi in my lightning wallet to fund it? Thanks for your help.

I still can’t believe BTG is still holding above $200 - wtf 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:31:03
Would connecting to lightning generate passive income like mining?

Yeah - if you’ve got an account with them it’s time to move. This is crazy

Not trustless? Please enlighten me.

Bitflyer recently launched in the US too, any reviews?

OP, are any of the links so far what you were referring to? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:00:06
Yes. Someone misspelled it once I think and it became a thing

Any idea if Brave browser does?

What fork is happening in December?
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:17:32
All of the math, all of the history, all of the time 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:51:49
LTC would have been perfect for this! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:14:20
That’s awesome. What percentage of the gains are you paying in taxes?

Who cares. Another day, another fork 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:40:24
Quite a few variables here: 1) what mining components are you using? (S9 asic probably) 2) how much is electricity where this mining is taking place? 3) how much is the difficulty increasing over time?
So for an s9 right now it takes about a year to mine .46 bitcoin with 14 th/s at 1370 watts
Hope this helps.

thanks for the heads up!

By moving it to a wallet like electrum, you'll have the private key (you don't have a private key for coinbase). After the forks, you'll be able to redeem the same amount of Bitcoin on the new forks with your private key. So purely from a value stand point, I think it's worth moving them. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:28:18
What? You were still able to recover your coins though right? With the seed? I was about to use tails until you said this. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:34:04
Thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:38:59
SOME people have instant purchases through their bank. I do not :(
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:03:31
Not sure why anyone uses coinbase. Use gdax, it's owned by coinbase and you can even use your coinbase account to log in. Sending ETH, BTC and LTC is free (and fast, according to gdax). 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:51:44
Newbie here - replay protection is only needed if you send or receive bitcoin after the fork correct? What if you are just holding? Thanks for your help. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:41:45
Thanks for the info. I don't think I have enough BTC to justify the price of a hardware wallet but I'll take it into consideration. Might be worth a lot more in the future ��
