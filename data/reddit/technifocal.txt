If a transaction doesn't get confirmed within a certain period, nodes might drop it from their mempool (meaning that it might not ever be confirmed). You should not worry about this though (unless you are the recipient of a transaction) as all that means is that the transaction is "undone", you will lose no money and the funds will still be the sender's wallet.
I personally rarely pay above 2-4 sats/vbyte. The transaction normally gets confirmed on the weekend. I find [this]( site a good visualiser on how full the mempool is.
Once again, it really depends on how urgant your transaction is. If you don't care (moving funds between yourself) then just do 2 sat/vbyte, if you do then you have to personally decide what value you're willing to pay.
I literally cannot stress enough however: SWITCHING TO SEGWIT WILL SAVE YOU A DECENT PERCENTAGE. MAKE SURE YOUR ADDRESSES START WITH `bc1`!
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:54:56
So in this scenario, for each transaction you spend you have to include the:
* Pubkey of user/device 
* Pubkey of user/device 
* Pubkey of user/device 
* Signature of one user/device
* Signature of another user/device
As you can see, there is a lot more data compared to the usual single user transaction. Schnorr signatures *I believe* (though am not sure) will help a bit, but you'd still ultimately need the two pubkeys&amp;two signatures.
This issue is exacerbated if you're not using segwit as none of this data can go into the segregated witness meaning that you're paying a premium for storing your data. I can't give a percentage saved by switching to segwit, but I'd certainly give it a go and compare your fee levels.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:40:50


I think it can, at least where I live, for one simple reason: They take a payment method people actually have.


[Nope]( only SEPA, Wire transfer, or credit card (at a premium, I assume, though it's not documented).


Because if I want the average person to buy Bitcoin, I have a choice of attempting to convince them to provide ID and a bunch of other information (which is hard enough) or convince them to register a whole separate bank account (Revolut) just to send SEPA payments to BitStamp who then also require ID and a bunch of other information.


I don't really want my personal information going to anyone, but that's not really a choice you can make unless you're willing to pay a premium (3-10%).

What? You'd ship some sort of non-volatile logically accessible/addressable storage, such as a [256GB USB mass storage device]( with the blockchain on it.

Honestly, I'd still recommend Samourai wallet. While I do not agree with some of their practices, their software is actually quite good (especially when paired with Dojo).
That said, I wouldn't trust any Android wallet too much as automatic updates from your app store of question means that any developer can (relatively) easily exit scam.

Sure, but even one user is better than no user am I have used them personally (so one user).


Great, but one doesn't support my jurisdiction and the other doesn't my country's standard payment method. Coinbase supports both.


Debatable. Coinbase provides a very user-friendly way for users to sign up and purchase Bitcoin at low prices. This is unparalleled from what I can find anywhere else.

I think neither and don't see how they're "clearly incompetent". I do fully admit that they should have made the point that their backend has your XPUB clearer but I wouldn't consider that malicious or incompetence, just the assumption that they're not an attacker (which I'm not saying is a good assumption, just not malicious or incompetent).
That said, if you can find me a post by either developer denying this occurs I'll probably change my opinion from "moderating overstating privacy due to not considering themselves as an attacker" to "malicious deceit to acquire information".


Stonewall on its own being the only implementation doesn't provide much privacy, but Stonewall while Stonewallx2 exists does. I'm not even going to claim it's a large privacy jump because of the very few people who use Stonewallx2, however it is a non-nil value. The whole point of the system is to provide ambiguity, not to suddenly provide confidential transactions.
Development plans exist to improve the UI of Stonewallx2 &amp; Stowaway to (hopefully) increase use of these features.


This one I cannot see your point, unless you're arguing about the lack of Dojo support. Could you please explain why you feel "Whirlpool is no better"?


Could you provide some information on which leaks it doesn't "plug"?
As for being the default mode, it's hard to default to requiring users to install a 250GB+ blockchain when they first install your Android app. You can enable it before you generate your wallet though, preventing Samourai's backend from seeing anything (assuming implementation is done correctly).


I don't disagree with you, but could you recommend a wallet and explain what they do to enable "by-default privacy"?


I'm not actually experienced with Mycelium's mechanics so I don't wish to comment too much, but from what I gathered off Google they use a similar model of querying a centralised backend. This is, as you stated, comparable to Samourai Wallet's implementation but completely dismisses the fact that a user can run their own backend (Dojo) via Samourai Wallet.


I do admit that some of their replies aren't the best. I've seen them go both ways, both very helpful and very aggressive.

@_date: 2019-07-04 14:23:58


Correct, money will never be lost. It will either be in the sender's address or the receiver's. Until it is confirmed it will be in the sender's address, after it is confirmed it will be in the receiver's. Funds cannot be lost due to low fee.


This means that they are P2SH. Whether they're P2SH-P2WSH (nested segwit, significantly more efficient than P2SH but less efficient than P2WSH) or just P2SH (not segwit) I couldn't tell you without seeing a transaction. If you'd like you could post a TXID that you spent from a multisig address and I could tell you, but be aware that it would reduce your privacy, alternatively if you look up your transaction on blockstream.info it might show you if it's segwit or not however I'm not sure if that supports multisig addresses.
Either way, it's still not as efficient as native segwit (addresses starting with `bc1`).

Why? It's standard in Europe to write numbers as `1.000.000,00` for one million.

When you generate a receive address does it start with `3` or `bc1`? Hopefully it'd start with `bc1` as that'd be native segwit (allowing you to put the expensive signature bytes into the segregated witness).
Be aware that multisig payments are inherently more expensive than standard payments as you have to include more data in the blockchain. The higher the `m` and `n` values the more data you have to include. Out of interest, what m-of-n are you using (how many signatures are required to be valid and how many signatures are in the multisig)?

I'm confused why you're specifically assigning blame of an extremely old bug (5+ years old) to a specific developer:
1. You say you have no commit, yet you're specifically assigning blame to SamouraiDev. Assuming this project was worked on by multiple people, how can you assign blame to one specific developer?
2. You say "As I noted, Blockchain.info deleted the commits, so I cannot cite the actual code, but Reddit explains it clearly. SamouraiDev used a custom [...]" yet the Reddit post at no point states who committed the buggy code
3. Do you have any evidence that SamouraiDev was employed at the company when the bug was even introduced?
4. If you can provide evidence for the above, then I do agree that's quite damning and should be considered. That said however, do you not believe that in 5 years people can learn and improve their expertise in a field?
I'd be interested in a response to this as I would like to hear both sides of the story, but as of current it sounds like "A company where a developer use to work over 5 years ago had a bug and now it's all his fault!".
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:45:17
It's a hard topic because I understand both sides. The developers don't want to be constantly answering why there are fees/whatnot in their client, and the proficient users just want a ballpark figure to make sure they're not off by a power of 10.
That said, I do believe working in sats (not BTC) helps with that regard. I'm not sure if it's for everyone, but 100,000 sats is easier to validate than 0.001 or 0.0001 or 0.01.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:41:35
It means the orchestrator (the mixer) can't work out which inputs and outputs relate based on your IP address.
For example, if 5 Reddit users wished to mix together and I was the orchestrator (the server that links them together) and they all told me their input and outputs addresses, I'd know their input and output addresses (as they just told me). If each user registered 2 accounts and sent me a PM from account  that told me the input, and account  that told me the output, I'd have no idea which inputs and which outputs relate.
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:21:06

While I agree with some of the comments you have made, I do feel like this is a massive oversimplification teetering on fabrication of information I simply cannot agree with.
I do agree that the privacy between the user and the Samourai Wallet backend was poor before Dojo was implemented, but I do strongly believe that:
1. The developers of Samourai Wallet are genuinely attempting to create a privacy-enabling wallet, even if they're a bit quick to suggest it as being fully private before it was
2. Even though the wallet wasn't private in the sense of considering the Samourai Developer's to be a threat, their wallet has been incorporating techniques to manage privacy when considering attackers looking at the blockchain
3. The developers of Samourai wallet have, admittedly only recently, enabled users to run their own backend software (Dojo). I do once again admit that Whirlpool currently does not support Dojo and thus Whirlpool's privacy is significantly damaged if you consider the Samourai Developers to be an attack vector.
That said, I'm not going to claim that Samourai Wallet is perfect. There are other wallets that features that I prefer, such as Wasabi's UTXO management or Electrum's transaction labelling, stability and simple design.
I'm also not going to imply any of the developers for any of the wallets are perfect, they've all slung shit at one-another and honestly if I was going to start boycotting Bitcoin software over what the developers have done I'd probably be forced to go back to fiat.

Sure, but with a CoinJoin you cannot determine which Bitcoin went where (because it didn't, Bitcoin was destroyed and Bitcoin was created, no coin went anywhere).

I've heard it two ways:
1. Is that the `bitcoind` implementation only starts tracking UTXOs after the first block (Genesus). This means that even though the UTXO is valid, it's not recognised by `bitcoind` and thus if was attempted to be spent wouldn't be a UTXO that exists in `bitcoind`'s UTXO set.
2. The scriptSig is invalid, as it is `04ffff001d0104455468652054696d65732030332f4a616e2f32303039204368616e63656c6c6f72206f6e206272696e6b206f66207365636f6e64206261696c6f757420666f722062616e6b73` or `��&lt;NULL&gt;EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks`, which isn't a valid scriptSig.
Honestly, I've not read enough into bitcoind's source to give you a legitimate explanation, those are just the two reasons I've heard (which are both probably wrong).

This isn't really true though. It's more akin to showing the world that you're taking five different copper objects, melting them down, then distributing the copper back out to the five original owners.
Sure, the original "tainted" copper is in there but you can only really disregard the output copper if it's done at small scale. If all copper in the world was melted and remolded it'd be completely impossible to disregard it.
Even if the output copper was banned you can just melt it down and mold it a few more times on your own and suddenly be so far disconnected from the original mixing process that it'd be impossible to realistically ban all copper that was Y steps removed from an "illegal" melt as all copper in the world would be illegal^1.
(1) - Assuming the ban was done at the service layer (I.E. Merchants/Exchanges), if the ban was done at the miner level then issues could arise, but even then it'd be an extremely hard thing to initiate as there'd need to be, at the very least, 51% of miners against CoinJoins.

What? Assuming the only port exposed was 8333, you'd have to attack bitcoind (or Window's TCP/IP stack). Even if that was exploited Windows does a (relatively) good job at preventing remote code execution via things like ASLR and DEP.
Nothing is perfect and maybe Windows isn't the best of the best, but I wouldn't call exposing one service on Windows significantly more risky than exposing the same service on any other platform unless you've spent a good deal of time hardening said other platforms (proper SE-Linux configuration, for example), none of which would be comparable to something as user-friendly as a Windows installation.

Just to add on:
I don't personally use Blockchain.info for any major funds (I use my Electrum+Trezor &amp; offline wallets for that), but having a web wallet that you fully control the private keys to is very useful, especially with the features they provide as a company, rather than as a wallet.
Utilising every tool available for a job is the best way to go about things, and if Blockchain.info provides a service found nowhere else, then I'll happily use it, and I do.
But yes, I do understand how someone who is unable to access those features/do not care much about the UI could, and honestly should, use another wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:00:00
Bitcoins exist as one singular state, a UTXO. They do not slide gracefully from UTXO to UTXO, they are consumed and new ones are created. There are a few criteria that UTXOs can be created:
* As part of a transaction where the amount of bitcoins consumed &gt;= amount of Bitcoins created
* As part of a Coinbase where the amount of bitcoins created is &lt;= the amount of Bitcoin issued as a reward at that blockheight plus any leftovers from transactions (where the amount of Bitcoin consumed is greater than the amount of Bitcoins created)
Each state of a coin has a serial number (the outpoint, `TXID:voutn`).
My opinion is the the analogy with copper works fine until someone educates me that it does not. My opinion also is that you have no interest in actually discussing the logistics of how CoinJoins work and just wish to put others down, which is completely your choice. If you wish to actually discuss how the system works rather than stating sweeping statements then I cannot really help you.
Oh, and, for what it's worth, your statement here is wrong:


Which shows you lack understanding of how the actual protocol works. A miner can destroy Bitcoins by simply not claiming their fee, this information is [readily available on even the most basic of resources](
"If a valid block does not collect all available fees, the amount not collected are permanently destroyed"

I still feel like I'm missing your point. This is a free market, supply and demand. If a whale has a large supply, and there's little demand (In comparison to the sudden supply increase) then the price will drop. Same if the reverse happens, the price will rise.

I am in London, but I rarely go to touristy spots being a Londoner (Funny that, isn't it? I've travelled a decent amount, yet never even done as simple as go on the London eye in my own backyard).
Some tube stations have BTC ATMs if you're looking out for them, if you take a look [here]( you'll get an idea where they are.
Most are either in tube stations, currency exchanges or random shops that people have setup in. I've personally never sold to a BTC ATM before (See: They pay you horrific rates), so I have no idea how they work, but I imagine it won't give you the cash till the transaction is confirmed. As of current, with the fee of transactions, I'm not 100% sure I'd want to stand around waiting for the BTC network to confirm my transaction to get my cash. It honestly might be easier just using fiat exchanges for now.
If you do plan on using one, however, I'd be very interested in your experience.

I'm not 100% sure, but it's these addresses:
Compared to these (Multisig/Segwit):
Compared to these (Oldschool):
The general idea, however, is that bech32 uses less bytes to send a transaction than the backwards compatible `3`-starting segwit address, which uses less bytes to send a transaction than the old school `1`-starting addresses.

Could you post a link to "weaknesses clearly demonstrated about their mixing tool"? I'd be interested in giving it a read.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:18:04
The exchange would have all the information required to deanonymize you. They would be the orchestrator in this whole deal.
Samourai Wallet has a *relatively* cheap Whirlpool service which is designed to prevent anyone (even the orchestrator) from deanonymizing you assuming you use it correctly (with Tor &amp; Dojo), but it's not fully finished (lacks Dojo support). You can read about it more [here](
Another service that provides this functionality is Wasabi, but they're quite expensive (0.003% per anonymity set). It's hard to give an accurate price analysis for Wasabi due to the fact the price changes based on what other user's are doing (the amount they're mixing, the amount you're mixing, the amount of users, etc...)
An additional metric for you to consider is what anonymity set you want. How obscure do you want to be? An anonymity set of 1 means that people know that address A and address B are connected (1/1), an anonymity set of 2 means that they have to make a 50/50 guess (1/2), an anonymity set of 3 means a 33/67 guess (1/3), etc...

While I do agree that 6,000 transactions per second isn't really many (That's, if my back-of-the-napkin maths is correct, less than 1 billion people with 10 channels open lasting 1 month per channel -- that's not that many if we want Bitcoin to be used as "the" global currency).
But, at the same time, what's the solution? Infinite-byte blocks? I run a full node and an electrumx server, I don't mind dedicating the 200GB-odd that's required to run it. Hell, even 1TB or even if I'm particularly generous and I don't have any redundancy on the data, 8TB, but I think that's where I'd draw the line.
If we had 1GB blocks and they were being used, [I'd be out of the game in only 54 days]( and I do believe I'm more generous than most folks with my HDD space. Most people don't even have 8TB, let alone want to just give it away to allow new peers to sync from.

Sure, so Samourai Wallet is big on privacy. Dojo and Whirlpool are two methods to achieve that.
[Dojo]( - A piece of software that will monitor your balances/whatnot. This replaces any infrastructure that Samourai host themselves, meaning that Samourai have no idea how much BTC you have/anything like that.
[Whirlpool]( - A mechanism that performs CoinJoins on your funds to obscure the history and future of your Coins.

In all honesty, what it could be is that their UXTO pool is all unconfirmed and they don't want to send you a transaction with an unconfirmed input.
They have the majority of their funds offline, so, it wouldn't surprise me, in which case, I can hardly blame them.
If they batched up transactions, this would mitigate this issue, if this is the issue.

1. Their currency has hyperinflation, Bitcoin has deflation, thus they feel the 10 to 100% increase in BTC's price is worthwhile compared to their fiat currency
2. You can't mine it there due to the fact there's lots of already existing heat (hard to cool), dusty (damages moving parts of mining equipment), and the power network in these countries are bad

Use a different address every time for privacy's sake. There's no security issue, it's just that then people won't know how much you have in BTC.
When you spend, your wallet will automatically join different addresses together to get enough money (I.E. If you received 0.5BTC in address 1, and 0.5BTC in address 2, when you spend 0.75BTC it'll spend both addresses &amp; create a third address for you where your change (0.5BTC+0.5BTC=1BTC-0.75BTC=0.25BTC) will go.

I'm not saying they haven't in the world, but at least from what I've found they're still the best here in the UK.


They're in it for the money, not the technology, that is evident. At the same time, I can't necessarily say I disagree with their logic. They are a business after all. That said, Bitcoin should be able to withstand attacks if it claims to be censorship resistant, which so far it has.

Sort of, it enforces the legitimacy of transactions. It's not a massive thing, but every little helps. It also gives _you_ that piece of mind that your BTC actually exists, and isn't counterfeit^1


Something like that. Yes, but, if the VPS host is malicious they could still lie to you. Over the top paranoia? More than likely, but something to consider.


Anywhere that has cheap/free bandwidth. AWS would be terrible. DigitalOcean, OVH, Vultr (I've never used), etc... would all good in that sense.
Also consider maybe running your server on infrastructures that don't already have Bitcoin nodes running there, ten thousand nodes all on one host is still pretty centralised.
Also be aware that to be a full node (Unlike a pruned node), you need to store ~175GB (And growing every day!). If you want to run some sort of light client software on top of that (Such as Electrum-X), that's another 27GB (and growing) on top of that.
On DigitalOcean, this would end up running you:
$20/month for a 3GB of RAM node with 3TB of transfer (You might be able to get away with less, but my docker containers right now for bitcoind+electrumx are 1.7GB+103MB... not sure how much of that is swappable).
$0.10/GB/month for additional storage (at-least 180GB required) = $18/month
That's a total of $38/month to run a node on a VPS solution such as DigitalOcean. You consider if it's worth it, I personally feel that running it on a dedicated host such as Kimsufi (At only €5.99/month) or a physical host (Such as a Raspberry pi and external HDD) and donating the rest to development of Bitcoin-related projects (Such as Lightning) would be a better use of the money.
1 Most light clients *I believe* do have additional checks to prevent the "creation" of BTC, malicious nodes could still hide transactions from you/whatnot.

It's honestly not that hard, it looks daunting but you can learn very easily. Load up a real time regex matcher, set yourself a channel (like match currency, but only if it's formatted in the format "£x,xxx,xxx.xx") then play around.
For example:
To break it down:
`£` = Literal `£`, I.E. must start with a `£`  
`\d{1,3}` = Anywhere between one and three digits, because `£1,000.00` is valid, `£10,000.00` is valid, and `£100,000.00` is valid, but `£,000.00` isn't nor is `£1000,000.00`.  
`,\d{3}` = literally match a comma then any three digits exactly, because `£1,000.00` is valid, but `£1,00.00` or `£1,0000.00` isn't.  
`(?:)` = `(?:)` defines a non-capturing group, meaning you can perform additional commands against the search terms in the group as a whole, rather than individually. Inside this group is the above `,\d{3}`  
`*` = Repeat the last search term (the group of search terms in the non-capturing group) zero to infinite times. This is because `£1.00` (with no comma and 3 numbers) is valid, and so is `£1,000.00` or `£1,000,000.00`. The `,\d{3}` can be repeated zero, one, two, or infinite times.
`\.` = The literal `.`, escaped because `.` on its own mean any character
`\d{2}` exactly two characters, because `£1,000.00` is valid, but `£1,000.1` isn't, nor is `£1,000.001`.
I realise this makes it sound super complicated, but if you actually sit down step-by-step and understand it, you can really make regex do anything you want, just like magic!

Fees are high because each block can only hold so many transactions, and blocks can only come (or should only come) once every 10 minutes. A limited amount of blocks per unit of time with a limited amount of transactions per block = a limited rate transactions before more are created than can be confirmed.
Once that occurs, you have a bidding war. Currently the bid is at ~140sat/byte. Nothing you can really do.

Weird. I found [this]( and [this]( in the LND source code that specifies otherwise.
I couldn't even imagine 0.04294967296 could be valid as it's not a value represented by Satoshis, as one Satoshi is 1E-8 Bitcoins. The article writer just has a LMGTFY link rather than any source.
[I also couldn't find that value in the RFC]( as the author stated it was in the "lightning protocol".
Maybe he's right, not saying he isn't, I'm just saying I can't find a source to back that up.

To be fair that's basically the same as any site. It sounds just like `User-Agent` + Google Analytics, but I might be wrong.


This just sounds like your `User-Agent`.


That I do agree sounds pretty bad. Note, however, the only real information they'll have on you is:
* Your Reddit username (already public, see [here](
* Your Reddit sign up date (2014-11-01, already public, see [here](
* The data your PC specifically sends them (`User-Agent`, `IP`, etc...)
* Your node pubkey when you withdraw
If you'd prefer to post a lightning invoice here for 5k sat I'll pay that instead, however the same issues will exist there (I'll know your username, sign up date, node pubkey and potentially your IP address depending on how your Lightning node is configured).

Maybe you misread, I start with 1BTC in the channel, I buy a coffee for 0.01BTC, I sent 0.5BTC to my friend, my friend sends 0.25BTC back.
`1BTC-0.01BTC-0.5BTC+0.25BTC`=0.74BTC for me, and 0.26BTC for the coffee guy (0.25BTC of which goes to my friend in another channel from coffee guy -&gt; my friend, 0.01BTC for my coffee).
Or am I still missing the point you're making? :(

Debatable. Price would slip not only because you're selling so many coins but also because of the very fact that these coins moved.

In theory, it never left. In practice, possibly after 14 days (4 days more), possibly not. Basically whenever everyone stops caring about your transaction and forgets it. What wallet do you use? It might be worth creating a transaction with a decent fee and send it directly to a miner using their broadcast transaction options.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:02:11
I don't mine, but assuming everyone is using an Antminer S9 (obviously they're not, but let's assume because I've seen people say it's very efficient):
[Based on their site, no matter which batch you got, they're all equally efficient at 98w per TH/s](
[This says the peak hashrate was 14,867,776TH/s](
14,867,776TH/s * 98w/TH/s = ~[1.5 billion watts](
Assuming a block comes around every 10 minutes and 1600 transactions fit in a block (Based on the average of the last 4 blocks, I can't be bothered to go back further), I *believe* (I'm always really bad with electricity) that is:
[1,500,000,000watt * (10 minutes) / 1600]( = 156.3kWh.
I find this genuinely amazing, and I can't quite wrap my head around it. I feel like I must have made a mistake.

How would it work? What if a "new" miner popped online, had no old mempool, received a few 10sat/byte transactions and mined a block? "Oh, sorry, despite doing the work you didn't choose the ones I remember so I'm not accepting that"?
Legitimate question, not being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:27:52


Yeah, throw it on Github gists, I'm interested.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:46:29
I'm almost certain, especially because I don't believe Mycelium supports segwit, that your transaction will expire from the mempool of the majority of clients before being mined.
Seven cents, as described by you [here]( is ~0.000005 BTC with this week's exchange rate. On an average transaction of (let's just say) 190 bytes (one input, one output, no change), that's:
(0.000005BTC/190bytes)*(100000000sat/BTC) = ~2.63 sat/byte. Based on [this]( site, 2-5 satoshi per byte transactions haven't really been at the top of the transaction pool at-all in the last 2 weeks. You might have gotten lucky and had it mined ~Nov 25th, or simply because a miner decided to mine it at any point between now and then, but... I'm just saying it's probably a gamble getting that included in a block before the 2 week expiration date on most nodes kick it out.
Even if it did work, and you were to get mined, that's a 7% fee on your transaction. Not very practical.

@_date: 2017-12-12 14:45:59
Correct. Your friend would have their own channel with "you" and they'd have paid you 0.25BTC in order not to collect it from me.
Think of it like this, imagine we went to a bar, I paid £6 for drinks and my friend paid £10. I now owe the bar £6, however, I bet my friend £5 that I can beat him in a game of pool and I win. Now, instead of my friend paying me £5, me paying the bar £6 and my friend paying the bar £10, what ends up happening is:
I pay the bar £1  
My friend pays the bar £15  
My friend pays me nothing.  
The outcome is the same either way, it's just a different way of "settling". The same thing happens in Lightning, instead of my friend paying me 0.25BTC, my friend pays 0.25BTC to you that I owe, and you call it quits on me for that 0.25BTC.

I do understand your point-of-view, however, Bitcoin, as it stands, is shit as a currency for small, day-to-day transactions. So anyone buying into it is either:
1. Using it to transfer large sums of money between parties where traditional methods would cost too much (I.E. Into/out of countries with bad banking systems, possibly across borders depending on banking fees, etc...)
2. As an investment
3. Because they believe the fees will go down and with new technologies they will be able to use it as a currency.
However, people that have:


Probably are the people that are doing,  as an investment.
All I can say is that with any investment, prices go up and down, I do genuinely try and help people as much as I can, however, if losing $20 is so much to you that you need to cash out to save the funds, I honestly have to say don't bother. With the fees for transfers, exchanges, and transactions being so high, you're probably never going to make a ROI, even if the currency doubles.
If you're using this as a currency, then by all means, but... like I said, that's not really possible either.

Imagine a SHA256 hash operation (a very, very quick hash that the Bitcoin network uses for mining) was equivalent to properly ordering, converting, hashing, calculating private keys, calculating public keys and performing a balance lookup (Spoiler: it's not)... then:
The [apparent HashRate of the network's peak is 14,867,776 terahashes per second]( That is 14,867,776,000,000,000,000 hashes per second throughout everyone on the Bitcoin network.
Let's assume everyone on earth has 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) wallets each, and there are [7,587,745,075 people on earth]( We'll round that up to 10,000,000,000 people for easy maths.
That means there are [10^19]( wallets, which is technically impossible because there are only [2.1*10^15 Satoshis available in Bitcoin]( but we'll go with it, maybe we're trying to exploit privacy, not steal funds.
This means that, if my tired-state maths is correct (Probably isn't), to crack a 24 word mnemonic (2^256 bits for entropy, ignoring the 8 extra checksum bits (264 total)):
Average number of attempts needed to get access to any random wallet (Probably not true due to the birthday paradox, but I'm not a crytographer, so, this is really just guess work) = 2^256 (Bits of entropy) / Number of wallets in existence (Assuming equally distributed)
Number of attempts needed to access a random wallet / attempts per second = total length to crack just one wallet
[Apparently 2.468*10^31 years]( to crack just 1, random persons wallet, if everyone had 1 billion wallets each and there were 10 billion people on earth. I've probably fucked up the calculation, but yeah.

Lightning has no technical limit preventing this, and between large hubs probably will be done to "rebalance" the channels.
The only issue is that with Lightning (unsure about other layer 2 solutions, but I can imagine they're the same), moving 1BTC between a path of 5 people moves a total of 5BTC in the network. This is awkward and a few large transactions could easily "one-side" the entire network, increasing fees for many people.
Oh, and, worst case with Lightning, you could always just make loads of small transactions. Not like they're *that* costly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:30:11
It means per kilobyte worth of transaction data, you are spending 0.005BTC in fees. If the transaction data is 1/10th of a kilobyte, you'll spend 1/10th of 0.005BTC.
If you hit "preview" it'll show you the finalised fee.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:55:35
That is a valid point that I do not understand, I don't understand the whole system.
I know Lightning can extend the duration of a channel if both parties agree^(1), however, I couldn't find online if that'd require another on-chain transaction (And I believe it probably would, as the other party has a transaction that's about to be valid). So, it probably would require one new on-chain transaction, but only one, if both parties just want to "renew" the channel.

Let's say there are 1BTC in fees, and the current block height specifies the miner is owed 12.5BTC "out of thin air" for generating the block.
They will add a new transaction, called the "coinbase transaction", which basically says "Nobody paid {miner's address} 13.5BTC". People agree that they're allowed to do that because the 12.5BTC reward + 1BTC fee = 13.5BTC.

If you have to ask that, it's not worth it.
Also, developing a bot to convert the 12 words into a list of addresses and do address lookups on BTG/BCH/BTC would be trivial, so, I really doubt a human does it anyway. You input the seed, it empties the wallet automatically.

No, the wallet file does not have to be on the original drive. Did you check all the addresses related to your wallet? If so, are you 100% this address:
1. Had funds
2. Is the same wallet that had the funds?

You can't use your own custom string that's longer than 12 words. For starters, it has to either be either 128 bits, 160 bits, 192 bits, 224 bits or 256 bits. Anything inbetween, more, or less, is technically invalid for BIP39.
On top of that, there's a checksum, which is 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits, depending on the bit length of the seed itself. Those two values (Seed + Checksum) are concatenated and split into 11 bit chunks, which are then referenced against a [very specific wordlist]( that has exactly 2^(11) words (2048). This means that:
Seed length | Checksum length | Total size (Seed+Checksum) | Words (Total size / 11)| Chance of getting a checksum right randomly
128|4|132|12|1 in 16
160|5|165|15|1 in 32
192|6|198|18|1 in 64
224|7|231|21|1 in 128
256|8|264|24|1 in 256
So, not only would your "own custom string that's longer than 12 words" not work because it's highly unlikely you'll pick random words from the wordlist, but even if you did, you'd _have_ to pick either 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 words (To be BIP39 compliant) and the checksum would mean it would be very likely invalid. All of this is described in further detail [here](

Yes, assuming the wallet isn't encrypted. If the wallet _is_ encrypted, and you can describe what the password *might* have been, you can either try and crack it yourself (Using BTCRecover) or pay someone to do it for you.
Just be aware, anyone you give that wallet to can take all your BTC/BCH/BTG, which is why I'm trying to help you do it yourself rather than saying "Give me your wallet and I'll do it", if that makes sense.

In a very, very simplified manner, the idea is that instead of me signing my BTC from my address to your address and broadcasting that for the world to see, I simply sign a transaction and **give that to you out-of-band**. If I then come back and make another transaction, I can simply "update" that previous transaction, either positively (I.E. I'm paying you more) or negatively (I.E. You're paying me back).
Obviously it's a lot more technical than this, but, it's:
1. Still fully Bitcoin (not a fork), the only main difference is that instead of transactions occurring on-chain, they happen between me and you directly, only settling on-chain when we no longer want to exchange money between one another
2. Funds are fully locked until we agree we no longer want to trade
3. Fees (For miners) are only paid when you lock funds away (I.E. From your BTC address to a shared controlled address for the duration of the "trading" period), and when you unlock funds (I.E. Taking funds from the shared locked address and send the owed amount to both my address and your address)
The main question that is asked is "Well, that's great, but since I can only send money to you if I already pay a transaction fee to put the money into a shared address, what's the point?". The idea is that if I can pay you instantly, and you can pay someone I want to pay instantly, then what you can do is for a small fee (Say, 5 satoshi), is accept my payment to you instantly and pay my friend instantly. Thus, without needing to create another "channel" or pay any additional miner fees, we (me &amp; my friend) can trade instantly without having a channel between us. These hops (I.E. Me -&gt; You -&gt; My friend) can be very long, allowing very complex routes to exist (I.E. Me -&gt; A shop I visited last week -&gt; A customer they had yesterday -&gt; An online retailer that customer used -&gt; The supplier of that online retailer -&gt; An exchange -&gt; Another user of that exchange -&gt; A drug kingpin -&gt; a dealer -&gt; a prostitute -&gt; one of her customer's -&gt; a cafe -&gt; my friend).
Once again, this is all trustless, if any user backs out the whole chain is cancelled and nobody pays anything.

Probably because you're trying to spend the same UXTO as with the BreadWallet. Wait 14 days for the transaction to expire. Or copy the raw transaction and send it directly to miners using their "broadcast TX" option.

If they're in the same wallet, just make the transaction as normal. Since they're two inputs, you will be charged more than if it were just one input (Especially on Blockchain.info due to lack of segwit), but it will be less than making two individual transactions.

The reason why the, as said, "metric isn't applicable" is because it basically is infinite. The only real limitation, assuming you're trading from me to you and back again, infinite times, is:
1. The speed I can sign transactions (I.E. CPU/RAM/Transfer bus)
2. The speed I can transmit those signed transactions to you (I.E. Network)
3. The speed you can sign transactions
4. The speed you can transmit those signed transaction to me
5. The time the protocol overhead takes
It's sort of like asking "How many pages can I load per second?" in terms of the internet. Well, I mean, if you're in a very poor country with 1KB/s of internet, 3 seconds of latency to get out of your ISP, no concurrency, a computer from the 1970s, trying to run the best crypto suites around and you're trying to talk to a webserver on a similar connection on the opposite side of the world... then... it depends on the webpage you're loading. If you're loading a 4K movie over HTTP, then... 0.00000[...]00001 webpages per second.
If you're on a 40 gigabit point-to-point fibre optic cable bridging two massive computers transferring 1 byte back and forth with no encryption/whatnot, then, a metric shit ton.
If you're talking about the actual network, rather than the software, then... nobody really knows. The testnet isn't a great place for testing real-world usage of software and nobody really knows how the network is going to spread out. Some (most?) think it'll be a hub-and-spoke model, so, it really depends on how powerful those hubs are (In terms of transaction signing and bandwidth speed), and how many connections they have, I guess...

I wrote this explained this just the other day [here]( I still haven't double checked my maths, but I'll copy and paste it:
Imagine a SHA256 hash operation (a very, very quick hash that the Bitcoin network uses for mining) was equivalent to properly ordering, converting, hashing, calculating private keys, calculating public keys and performing a balance lookup (Spoiler: it's not)... then:
The [apparent HashRate of the network's peak is 14,867,776 terahashes per second]( That is 14,867,776,000,000,000,000 hashes per second throughout everyone on the Bitcoin network.
Let's assume everyone on earth has 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) wallets each, and there are [7,587,745,075 people on earth]( We'll round that up to 10,000,000,000 people for easy maths.
That means there are [10^19]( wallets, which is technically impossible because there are only [2.1*10^15 Satoshis available in Bitcoin]( but we'll go with it, maybe we're trying to exploit privacy, not steal funds.
This means that, if my tired-state maths is correct (Probably isn't), to crack a 24 word mnemonic (2^256 bits for entropy, ignoring the 8 extra checksum bits (264 total)):
Average number of attempts needed to get access to any random wallet (Probably not true due to the birthday paradox, but I'm not a crytographer, so, this is really just guess work) = 2^256 (Bits of entropy) / Number of wallets in existence (Assuming equally distributed)
Number of attempts needed to access a random wallet / attempts per second = total length to crack just one wallet
[Apparently 2.468*10^31 years]( to crack just 1, random persons wallet, if everyone had 1 billion wallets each and there were 10 billion people on earth. I've probably fucked up the calculation, but yeah.

1. Yes
2. On an encrypted file on Blockchain.info's servers. So, technically your wallet, but they also have a copy of it (albeit, encrypted).
3. No. Do not do this. The _only_ backup you need/should make is the 12 word seed. _Try_ not to keep it digital (I.E. Not a text document in lastpass/gmail/etc...), but worst comes to worst, if it's not that much money, it's not the end of the world. Just be aware that anyone who has that seed (Including hackers gaining access to your accounts) have all your BTC.

That's for a different client, [bitcoin-qt]( It's simply the format of storing the keys.


Yes, or just simply log back into Blockchain.info with your wallet ID (They emailed to you) and your passphrase. Be careful about making new accounts (Settings -&gt; Addresses -&gt; Add account) or using other currencies (Bitcoin Cash/Ethereum) without someone else commenting, as _I_ am not 100% sure they're backed up with your 12 words.
Also, a backup is useless unless you restore from it. Pretend you lost your wallet, go recover it. Make sure it works. If you can't (work out how, or can't recover) then there's an issue and you should stop, work out why you can't recover, and rectify it before you actually do need to recover for real.

^(1) - It didn't work so well under load, even a couple dozen invoices being created per second brought the whole service down, making one of the transactions I created get marked as "expired", despite sending money when 14 minutes were remaining. While I don't expect this kind of load (I wish I was that popular!), I was running it on an i7-4790k w/ 32GB of RAM, something I wouldn't be running in production, this makes me question how stable it would be to to any amount of load when running on a $5/month VPS.

Watchtowers, from my understanding, listen for people trying to broadcast previous states of the channel (I.E. When you owed them more than you do) and then broadcast the current state if they do.
You can turn your phone off or whatever even without these watchtowers, it's just I believe that if you've got an open channel with a malicious party who broadcasts the old transaction, you're out of luck. But yes, this would be a 3rd party (or just any computer you have that is online 24/7).

Exactly this. I've personally got ~15-20 personal bank accounts spread over ~5 different banking institutions, not a single one of them charges me for:
1. Having the account, even if I have nothing in the account. They do, admittedly, state they will close my accounts and send me a cheque if I'm idle for too long (6+ months with no transactions), but that's fair enough.
2. Sending money via instant bank transfers domestically. One of them even doesn't charge me for international transactions. The rest admittedly do charge for international transactions, which varies from ~$0.50 to ~$35 depending on the bank and speed I want the transaction to occur (few days -&gt; few hours)
3. Using my debit card (they do admittedly have fees, just charged to the merchant, as you say, invisible to me), even internationally
4. Receiving money, even internationally (though a few of them give me shit exchange rates)
Even with businesses accounts (of which I manage ~6 accounts over 2 banking institutions):
1. Only one charges me a monthly fee, which they've expressed interest in dropping (though I will soon to close this account because of the monthly fee)
2. Sending money is free domestically, with the aforementioned $0.50-&gt;$35 fee for international transactions depending on speed
3. Using my debit card is free domestically on both the institutions, and only the one that charges me a monthly fee charges me a percentage fee for international transactions
4. Receiving money is completely free. This is assuming it's not a cash deposit at a branch, in which case I do pay a small % for the bank teller's time to count and validate the money isn't counterfeit.
On top of all of that, they actually pay me (admittedly next to nothing) to keep my money, but it varies from an absolute minimum of 0.5% to around 5% for personal accounts depending on your account status/amount of money/promotional periods/etc, and 0% to around 1.5% for business accounts.
EDIT: Also, if you use forms of credit (Such as credit cards), they normally also offer deals and cashback, either 0% interest or anywhere from 0.5% to 5% cashback (once again, depending on personal/business, promotional/not, etc...)

"Take it out" in what regard? Cash? Potentially, depends on if the branch in question deems that they have enough cash in reserves in that branch, if not they may give you a smaller amount (£2-5k) and ask you to collect the rest tomorrow.


Overdraft? What does that have to do with withdrawing your money? That's a system for providing short term loans.


Why not? I have an overdraft, very useful.


I'm very confused with this statement. Yes, if you have nothing in your bank account and you try and buy something without an overdraft facility, your transaction will fail. That's not a surprise, that's just being broke. I assume this isn't what you're saying though, could you rephrase?


I have done this with both personal accounts and business accounts, rendering their balance at almost complete zero. Nobody has ever tried to stop me. I will admit, Santander did call me and ask to validate the transaction, but once I went through security they put it through.


Pardon? Do you mean cash deposit? I've personally had £2k deposited into my account in a single day, which is a small sum, into my personal account. I know people who have had £15k+ deposits without issue.


Once again, I'm confused what you mean. How would they deposit cash into your account if you didn't have an account? Please rephrase.


I am saying that.


Bank transfers cost nothing.


My bank offers 0% exchange rate fee (with Mastercard). I'm not even sure if they charge a card processing fee as lots of places say "Debit card only" or "No fee when paying with debit card", for example PayPal (I can send money to friends for free), Circle (I can send money to friends for free via my debit card), CashApp (I can send money to my friends for free via my debit card), ATMs (I can withdraw money for free, at any ATM, unless the ATM charges a fee (really rare)), and Curve (I can proxy transactions for free). Even if they do, it's invisible to me. I do know some processors do charge fees (such as Stripe/Square).


I've not seen a spend limit at a shop for a debit card in a long time, nearly all of those are for credit cards. It's nearly always "no cards at all" or "no credit cards below £5", even then that's rare. All the kebab and corner shops I go to accept credit cards, even down to a can of coke at £0.59. I do concede that these exist, just becoming increasingly rare compared to ten years ago.

Pretty sure those limits are there for anti-money laundering laws, not because it's illegal to use an ATM. So, once again, source?


I have never had my accounts suspended for using an ATM, even excessively.


They can, extremely rare, but can. Over the last five years, I've had four transactions take longer than 2 hours:
1. My online banking portal went into maintenance one minutes after sending it, transaction was sent when the portal came back up around eight hours later
2. I made the transaction after 5PM, my business bank was closed and they wanted to call me the next business day to confirm.
3. I made the transaction after 5PM, my business bank was closed and they wanted to call me the next business day to confirm.
4. I made the transaction after 5PM, my business bank was closed and they wanted to call me the next business day to confirm.


Because robots/AI aren't perfect and they want to have a human look over it?


Correct, but that is what money is nowadays. I can get service with my debit/credit cards, I can do bank transfers, and I can withdraw my money at a bank. No issue.


There are some finance institutions in the UK that allow international transactions for free, but I've never used them for large (£1k+) transactions. Yes, though, international transactions are expensive.

I'm not Lightning expert by any means, so do not trust my judgement, but most of it sounds true from my understanding of the system. Few key points though:
1. At 3:20 he said "the transaction will fail", it will, but the higher level software (on the sender's side) will just retry that transaction automatically.
2. At 4:20 when he said "Varying internet speeds and processing power" - relaying a LND transaction takes very little of either, so that shouldn't matter.
3. At 4:45 It's highly unlikely that cell phones will be hops for transactions, simply for the fact that keeping connections open on LTE is power-draining, and you can't accept inbound connections.
4. He doesn't mention that you can choose not to broadcast channels by making them private

I feel like you're missing out on an awful lot of cases.
Just a small example, if I take a loan out at even a small 1% APR, and the currency is question is going up in value by 3% APR, then overall my loan is costing me 4% APR, these sorts of things put people off getting loans/blah/blah/blah.

Which country do you live in? Have you tried buying directly from sellers, such as on LocalBitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:50:02


What you're missing is that what is settled on the blockchain is "final" balance of the channel. You don't suddenly broadcast _all_ the transactions that occurred throughout the duration of that channel. For example:
1. I open a channel with you, I put in 1BTC. This is an onchain transaction so we mark/submit/mine this on the blockchain.
2. I buy a coffee from you, that's worth 0.01BTC, now my balance is 0.99BTC and your balance is 0.01BTC. This is off-chain, that 1BTC on chain has stayed in the same place.
3. I send 0.5BTC to my friend via you, now my balance is 0.49BTC and your balance is 0.51BTC.
4. My friend sends me 0.25BTC to me via you, now my balance is 0.74BTC and your balance is 0.26BTC.
5. We now decide that we want to close this channel, we _only_ broadcast the final "I get 0.74BTC and you get 0.26BTC" transaction. Transactions in step    are never on the blockchain. All the blockchain sees is 1BTC into an address, then 0.74&amp;0.26 out. Two transactions on chain in order for 3 off-chain. Except, these channels can last for as long as they both agree. This could be a month, six, a year, or five. Only when you finally want to "cash out" do you have another on-chain transaction.
To demonstrate this a little better, here's the same example above as a chart:
Description|My balance|Your balance|Broadcasted/on-chain
I open a channel with you|1BTC|0BTC|True
I buy a 0.01BTC coffee from you|0.99BTC|0.01BTC|False
I send 0.5BTC to my friend via you|0.49BTC|0.51BTC|False
My friend sends 0.25BTC to me via you|0.74BTC|0.26BTC|False
We close the channel (Either cooperatively or one-sided, note, cooperate closures are faster)|0.74BTC|0.26BTC|True
Your address is then credited 0.26BTC (on chain) and my address is credited 0.74BTC (on chain).
This means that even if we used this for microtransactions, and had 50,000,000 transactions in the channel, the blockchain doesn't care, all that's visible there is the "final" balance.

Yes and no.
Imagine you have 1BTC now. Currently, that's 100,000,000 of the smallest units possible, and is worth 1/21,000,000 the market cap.
 Bitcoin could "Print more Bitcoin"
When people start running out of Bitcoin, they add more Bitcoin into the market. Let's say they double the market, now you still own 100,000,000 of the smallest unit possible, but now it's only worth 1/42,000,000 of the market cap. You've just lost half your "worth". You still have the same "currency", but due to the increased supply the worth has halved.
 Bitcoin simply "splits further"
When people start running out of Bitcoin, they split existing Bitcoin into usable chunks. Let's say they divide the smallest unit you can have by ten. Now you own 1,000,000,000 of the smallest units possible, and it's still worth 1/21,000,000 of the market cap. You haven't gained nor lost anything, you've simply become able to split your currency further down further.
You still own the same percentage of the market, it's just you can split that percentage up more.

I mean, don't they just use that as one source of randomness xor'd with other random data?
userdata\^cpurandomdata\^kernelrandomdata = random key.
As long as no two pieces of random data can see each other (and be affected by each other), it doesn't matter how non-random any individual input is as long as at least one is. At least, that's what I've heard, I'm no cryptographer.
For example, a non-random `01010101` xored with `00100110` (100% random) is still random because `01010101` wasn't influenced by `00100110`, and knowing that `01010101` was xored with random data doesn't really help you identify the random data (which is now `01110011`). On the other hand, however, if I saw `00100110` and then chose my "non-random" data to be `11011001`, that's obviously an issue because the two pieces of data influenced each other and now equal `11111111`.
Basically what I'm saying is that *I believe* getting a bunch of sucky randomness isn't really bad as worst case it improves randomness, but once again I'm no cryptographer.

Integrity. Either due to accidental corruption when travelling across the net (TCP does have a checksum, but not an amazing one, UDP normally doesn't) or if they're using a third party hosting provider (such as Linux repositories using mirrors).
Out-of-band validation (such as PGP/GPG) is used when you have already established trust with a known key and want to valid that key has signed the content. Though, how do you do that over the internet? God if I know, which is why I don't use it. I'd be interested in other people's opinions, but if you're expecting the internet to be hostile, unless you've met the developer/packager in real life and exchanged keys, then how do you know the key you're validating isn't a fake one?

Because each transaction spends UTXOs. Two explanations:
When you spend a $10 note, you have a serial number on said note. When you give it to the vender, they give you a $5 note with its own unique serial. That's the same with UXTOs.
Transactions have hashes and outputs, a transaction hash looks like
    b02fdda7eec8501b8822efdb8316b1067ba9ce28b302e4afe05246b20a04004b
This transaction creates two UXTOs (but it can be any amount). When you want to spend the money, you specify the UXTO (`b02fdda7eec8501b8822efdb8316b1067ba9ce28b302e4afe05246b20a04004b:0`) and provide the signature to authorize it.

The lightning network isn't really like the bitcoin network. The bitcoin network requires consensus amongst everyone. The lightning network just needs consensus between the nodes communicating (and be verifiable against the bitcoin network).
This means you could have crazy setups like two massive banks having lightning clients that purely send money back and forth at insane rates without ever even connecting to the rest of the lightning network. In this sense, the lightning network can infinitely scale because one pair of two banks sending data or one billion pairs of two banks sending data makes no difference to anyone else as that data does not leave that pair of nodes.
On the other hand, if you have insanely long paths with next to no capacity then you won't be able to send money at all and when AMP comes out will probably murder your CPU trying to calculate the most efficient path, which by the time you do will be invalid.
I'm no expert on the matter, but I personally would say "it scales better than on-chain transactions but ultimately the use cases depend on if/when we get AMP and what the current network topology looks like".

Windows will start indexing and writing to the drive almost immediately (thumbs.db, 'System Information', etc...), and depending on the life of that device you might be risking stuff. At the same time, doing a full disk image can also cause issues (If the heads are, for example, slightly damaging the platters as they are skimming over it).
I'd honestly probably just recommend mounting the whole device as read only, then mounting it from some barebone Linux distro and browsing via the command line (As many GUI file managers try and preload images/etc...). If you can't find anything of interest almost immediately, then do a full disk image with that.

How much of a fee would you be "willing" to pay? The going rate for a transaction that size (lots of really small inputs, one output) would be ~0.0068BTC to get confirmed instantly. 
Is that the sort of price you're willing to pay?
Also, are you sending the funds to yourself to "consolidate" them, or are you sending it to someone? If the prior, your best bet would just be to wait until the fees go down. If the latter, then you've got to work out how much you're willing to pay to send that transaction.

Double spend is when two unconfirmed transactions exist spending the same UXTO. It's easy to create, but not really a risk as long as you don't accept unconfirmed transactions. The second either one is confirmed the other one will be invalidated, unless there is a reorganisation of blocks. For this reason, the general consensus is to wait for 6 confirmations, but in reality 2 is probably enough for all small transactions.
Think of it like this:
1. Something you'll act on in the future, such as an item you're dispatching tomorrow, is fine to say "Payment received, pending acceptance" and forward the user on with the checkout page. If it fails to confirm, you alert the user via email the next day and don't dispatch the item.
2. Something you'll act on immediately and can't reverse, such as crypto&lt;-&gt;crypto trades, wait for 6 confirmations (or use something like Lightning/atomic swaps)
3. Something you'll act on immediately, but can revoke (such as a cell phone plan or whatever): wait for 1 confirmation then revoke if issue.

Whirlpool allows you to mix automatically for a one time fee. You pay 5% of the pool size for however much Bitcoin you mix, and you can mix until you spend/transfer money out of the pool.
For example:
 in the 0.01 BTC pool:
    0.0005 (5% of 0.01 (pool size)) goes to pool coordinator
    0.00000605 (or whatever the miner fee is) is used per UTXO
    
    (1BTC to mix - 0.0005BTC coordinator fee)/(0.01 pool size + 0.00000605 miner fee) = 99 UTXOs, 0.00890105 unmixable left over
    1 - ((99 UTXOs*0.01 BTC per UTXO+0.00890105 unmixable change)/1 starting BTC) = 0.109895% to mix 1BTC
So, total charge is 0.109895% to mix 1 BTC. Obviously there are different pools for different values, so if you have more you can use the 0.05 pool. If you mix less, the percentage will go up because you're paying that static coordinator fee of 5% the pool size.
However, once you're in the pool, you can mix forever for free.

Which is true, but then again, now you've crossed a border, they've taken your access to your wallet and now you have to head back to get your seed, and shell out $100 on another Trezor.

What I *believe* it does is if you send another transaction is quick succession it'll RBF your last transaction to include your new transaction.
Basically you might sacrifice some privacy (merging UXTOs) for the sake of cheaper transactions (batching)

1. Pretty much, yes. the first 4 letters of each word are unique and can be used to produce 11 bits (1.375 bytes) worth of data. This data is a seed, which can be used to reproduce all Bitcoin private keys in your wallet. You can play with it [here]( but make sure you do not use your real seed.
2. Most use [BIP39]( but some use their own methods.
3. If there were 1,000,000,000,000 planets using Bitcoin and 1,000,000,000,000 people on each planet with 1,000,000,000,000 seeds each, there'd be 1,000,000,000,000^3 "worth while" seeds. Assuming you could try 1,000,000,000,000/millisecond, that'd be [1.835*10^18 years]( on average to guess one seed (I think, if my math is correct).

I've spoken to an awful lot of people who are uneducated about Bitcoin, and I don't believe a single one has ever thought you had to buy a full Bitcoin. That'd just make no sense, even if they think Bitcoin is only used for buying drugs online (of which I have encountered), who buys £7k worth of drugs?

To be fair, I was more joking than anything with Banana Man.
In all seriousness: Just say you mined them in 2010 with consumer grade hardware. Nothing purchased, 100% capital gains (worthless -&gt; worth a lot), pay ya tax and call it a day. If you did legitimately buy them from an exchange, then mixing them wouldn't matter as you'd just show the fact you bought them and that you're now selling them. The fact you moved them between addresses during that time shouldn't matter at all, and worst case you can cryptographically prove they're the same coin (but revealing all the hops they went through with signed messages from the private keys of those addresses).

I use Revolut a lot for business, not so much for personal (though I do have an account with them). Honestly, I can't say they're the best for banking, they take *hours* for inbound payments to be recognised, and like 30+ minutes for payments to send.
I do have to say though, their business API (while not stable in terms of uptime) is the best one I've found on the market. In fact, it's the *only* one on the market unless you turn to traditional banks and use another company to manage it programmatically (such as [TrueLayer]( but their fees are quite excessive in my opinion (£0.20/transaction compared to Revolut's £25/month flat for unlimited accounts).
So, unless you need the send payment API (which is only available on business accounts), Starling &gt;= Monzo &gt; Revolut &gt; all other banks &gt; nothing &gt; Santander (the literal worst bank), in my opinion of-course.

Sure, so most hardware wallets have their own RNG (time since boot, inputs, USB communications, etc...) and also xor that with randomness from the host PC they're connected to (keyboard input and timings, mouse input and timings, network interface communications, etc...).
Ultimately, you are correct, there is an algorithm to the randomness, it's just that the inputs to that are completely unpredictable ("How many cycles has the CPU on the host computer been running? How has the user moved their mouse exactly since boot?", etc...).

No, you still pay miners fees to transact.


Yes, but it'd be a lot of effort, would require you never connecting to the internet on your Pi, and honestly, I'd buy a device without wireless communication methods (WiFi/Bluetooth). You also need another device to connect to the internet and run a node (either your own desktop/laptop, or some random server online).


Unless you bought two Pis, or ran a full node on your PC, you couldn't do this as to be a cold wallet your first Pi would need to remain offline.


I'd say buy a consumer device such as a Trezor/Ledger if you're not already 100% sure what this would entail.

While I agree cloud mining is a scam, imagine an alternative:
Hey, I've got the ability to buy a money printing machine, if I run it all day it can make me $100 a day. Unfortunately, it'll cost me $1,000 and I cannot afford that. I know a good business plan, I'll let you buy it and I'll keep 5% of the profit. This means you'll make $95/day and I'll make $5/day.
Obviously though this only works if you assume that the cloud mining company has no other way of raising capital, which if they could literally print money they almost certainly could.

My understanding of Lightning payments are that there is a 32-byte preimage.
You give a user a `SHA256(PREIMAGE)` of the preimage, they pay you with the criteria that you tell them the preimage. You check the payment, validate you get your money, and tell them the preimage. From now on, the user can use the preimage to validate they actually paid you because there's no way they would have gotten the preimage otherwise.
That preimage is unique per payment. For example, if I run `decodepayreq` against a Bitrefill invoice:
    {
        "destination": "0254ff808f53b2f8c45e74b70430f336c6c76ba2f4af289f48d6086ae6e60462d3",
        "payment_hash": "038419f1e002905f316654d550cc536fc66aff4f6ef8ea8136f82e4acef94cb1",
        "num_satoshis": "167286",
        "timestamp": "1559747313",
        "expiry": "1200",
        "description": "Bitrefill 5cf7daf1addcb200049ff56b",
        "description_hash": "",
        "fallback_addr": "33gn2p1TaGXW94C9sCBd9PCUcchJqwxQV9",
        "cltv_expiry": "9",
        "route_hints": [
        ]
    }

Still doesn't mitigate a manufacturer attack, Windows, MacOSX, Linux, BSD, whatever, if the manufacturer wishes to push a malicious update to the device and you agree (For whatever benefits it adds), you're still fucked.


Utilising Trezor's official wallet (Which is the only wallet as of current, I believe, that supports SegWit), you have to have it connected any time you utilise the wallet.


As I said, the TREZOR works magic against malware attacks (All of the attacks you described). My issue isn't that, I firmly believe that as long as you follow best practices (Double checking the address on the TREZOR against an out-of-band method/etc...) the TREZOR is secure against anything but the most sophisticated malware utilising unknown zero-days in the TREZOR's firmware. My issue is manufacturer attacks, where they purposely push malicious (signed) firmware to the device. Obviously it'd kill their business, but at that point they've got a kiloshit-ton of BTC.

Ish. BIP stands for `Bitcoin Improvement Proposals` and they define a lot more than how to calculate addresses from seeds. You can read them all [here]( but they define things like:
1. Add operations to the scripting engine of Bitcoin
2. Change protocol specifications (communication between Bitcoin nodes)
3. Define how software should work together
But yes, the idea is that any two wallets that support the same BIP should work together in whatever they're attempting to do. For example, the controversial [BIP 70]( that BitPay uses only works with wallets that support it.

But with a Bitcoin wallet you're holding your money. With a lightning network you're putting your money at risk (Bugs, exploits, etc...) for very little gain.

`$ echo 'acquire antique equal equip frequent inquiry liquid mosquito quality quantum quarter question quick quit quiz quote require square squeeze squirrel unique amazing breeze flavor' | tr ' ' '
' | grep -o '^....' | grep -o '.' | sort | tr -d '
'`
I immediately know we can discount these 10 words because they contain two bs:




















We can also discount this word because it contains more than two ms:


These words due to more than one 'v':






We have now disqualified 14 words, taking us down to:
1/21841352414974605143073041582941798236684288000th the original problem size. This is only where I get stumped. Obviously, you've only got two "m"s, so when bruteforcing, let's say you start with:
Then followed up by:
You immediately know that all the rest of the words in the BIP39 seed contain no "m"s or "o"s (we used one m and one o per word, we only had two for the entire seed), we only have three more "r"s, a handful more "a"s and quite a few more "e"s.
You would also know that this seed could never contain the following words (701 of them) as they contain a 'm' or an 'o', which have already been used:

So to be a hub, you'd need lots of money. Meaning ~~it wouldn't be processing power as stated and~~ the barrier to entry (to be a useful, profitable, hub) is actually quite high (Having one channel isn't that useful, and having lots of channels which can transfer not a lot of money).

Hard to give advice like that when you don't know somebody's situation.
I know people who have mortgages with the money sitting in the bank (at a lower interest rate) because once they pay back that mortgage, they won't be able to get another at the same interest rate and it's worth paying X% interest to retain the instant-access available from already having the cash.

In London at least there's quite a few stores/ATMs that sell Bitcoin, admittedly at quite a markup (3% to 8%).
I've also had some luck buying small amounts on [Bisq]( but you need Bitcoin as a deposit there even as a buyer, so you're probably shit out of luck there.
[BitBargain]( also works wellish, but once again a markup.
Honestly, I just use Coinbase Pro, but it requires KYC.

Correct me if I'm wrong though, but I can run a BTC full node on a $3/month VPS. A lightning node requires funds to make channels, for users to propagate funds through me. They also get to charge a fee, though, if they desire.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:17:25
Fair enough, but, I do have a question.
Unlike Walmart and other mega-corporations, the profit on your capital will be minimal, no? Due to the fact you're competing on fees, the lowest fee will win, meaning most hubs will be making very little profit?
It'll obviously be interesting to see, I just don't see many people starting up nodes for any reason other than controlling the network or "for the good of the network". I realise that's the only reason people run bitcoin full nodes, and it works fine, it's just... these nodes require a lot of money, rather than a $2.50 VPS or home desktop everyone already has.
Unless I'm missing something.

No, it uses the same communication channels it uses to transfer the transaction data on. If you can sign transactions on the TREZOR utilising a host machine, that same host machine should be able to also update the firmware. However, I'm under the impression that you need to put the TREZOR into a "update mode" (by holding the two buttons while plugging it in, as described [here]( then confirming you wish to accept a new update) before it will accept an update. This, of-course, is assuming that the firmware image on your TREZOR is the same one as on Github (Who knows? I know I don't), and the source/firmware/bootloader on Github actually requires that (Once again, who knows? I didn't read the code).


Like I said, that's what I currently am doing for my "savings" account (My "current" account is my TREZOR). It's just people on this subreddit (And other places, like Andreas M. Antonopoulos during his talks) seem to state that a hardware wallet is bullet-proof wall, if you have your crypto on them, you're good for life.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:17:10
Put it this way, the TREZOR (in my, unqualified opinion) is theoretically great against malware attacks, but falls short on manufacturer attacks (I.E. The manufacturer, SatoshiLabs, wants to steal your funds) and possibly physical attacks (I.E. An attacker acquires your device and is sophisticated, they could manually take apart the TREZOR and possibly recover it that way).
I'd say it's better than a normal wallet (I.E. Electrum/etc...), but that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:26:56
I personally accept BTC via Electrum's API and a watch-only wallet.
Not 100% secure (if the server is hacked, it could serve up the attacker's Bitcoin addresses rather than mine), but oh well. It makes a payment request via the API, sets a timeout for 3600 seconds (An hour, yeah, it could fluctuate, but my application is high-latency), then checks the list of requests every minute for the state/confirmations.
Although, now I've seen [Bitcore]( if I were to write it again, I'd probably try that out.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:13:01
I can see what you're saying, and somewhat agree with everything except for:


Which I don't exactly believe. A hardware wallet, cryptosteel or paper wallet would be more secure, no? The private key is offline, and can't be stolen.
The private key needs to be constantly used for every transaction through the LN node to sign the "forward" transaction, meaning if you had a hardware wallet, it'd constantly be needing to ask for permission to resign transactions (to the point where you'd just say "yes" to every transaction, even that one made by a hacker who managed to access your server running your LN node), and if the private key wasn't even on an online PC (I.E. Airgapped laptop) then you're absolutely not signing anything and the lightning node becomes stagnant.
Or am I wrong again?

I've not used HodlHodl, so I am purely speculating.
Seller puts the bitcoin up for sale into a 2-of-3 multisig between the seller, the buyer, and HodlHodl.
Buyer and seller trade, if everything goes well then you're done. Buyer &amp; Seller sign a payment to the buyer and you never speak again.
Buyer and seller trade, if something goes wrong then both buyer and seller present their case to HodlHodl. HodlHodl will sign a transaction from either the buyer or seller depending on who they believe is being honest.
That way, no single person can scam the other. However, a seller + HodlHodl could collude and scam a buyer, but with all fiat trades it's reputation based.

That's what it claims, but here's my question, and obviously it's hypothetical. What if your Ledger has two update mechanisms, one that allows you to patch small functions without your consent (Like uploading a new function and providing a jump instruction over the existing function, storing it purely in RAM. It'd take like 1-2KB of RAM, something I'm sure the physical hardware has left over), and one that fully overwrites the firmware which requires your consent?
In that example, without your knowledge it could be updated to send your PIN and seed back over the USB data transfer channel.


But I didn't read the code, and even if I (or someone else) did, I didn't compile the code, cross validate it against the firmware that was patched to my device, etc...
And even if I did all of that, who's saying that there isn't firmware on the device that live-patches firmware to add malicious components?


Monitoring the USB traffic would only help if you were watching the backdoor being utilised live. What happens if the functionality is built in, but not utilised yet? Maybe waiting for even greater adoption until utilisation?


Unfortunately (From a security point-of-view, it's very convenient otherwise) the Trezor's official wallet is a website, which means the host machine's code could change at any time without an update being directly installed by you. I suppose some sort of Chrome extension could detect changes to the code, but really, who is running that? And even if you did, I wouldn't be surprised if the TREZOR chrome app could modify the code after the first app had already validated it as not having changed.


I don't think "anybody" could, I've very clearly detailed this would be a manufacturer attack, nothing else. The manufacturer (Or someone with their signing key &amp; direct access to their web servers to host the malicious firmware for download with their official client) would have to do this.


Fair enough, I suppose that is a valid point-of-view, however it somewhat degrades the TREZOR's usefulness as "easily spendable cold storage".


Like I said, I do use my TREZOR, I have a decent (In my opinion) amount on it, but I have more than that in a paper wallet because:
1. I don't see myself needing to spend a large amount immediately, and if I do, it's worth the hassle of making a new paper wallet, acquiring my paper wallet from where it is stored, restoring it, sending the money to the destination and the change to my new paper wallet.
2. I honestly don't trust my TREZOR. I trust it more than I trust a wallet on my desktop, but I still don't trust it.
3. My paper wallet doesn't have firmware updates\*.
\*Although I do need to update it soon, as the wallet I used was _not_ BIP{32,39,44,49}. It was an Armory wallet from ~2012-2014 (Not sure), and while Armory still exists, it's a very unique format that is only accepted by that one piece of software (From what I know). I'd rather move it over to a more standard format.

            print(publicAddress_3);

But now your money is in a hot location where it could potentially be hacked/exploited/etc... (As it needs to be connected to an online PC, rather than a cold wallet), so increased risk, but I don't see much profit.
I mean, if your money is already in channels because you're making channels with the people you do transfers with anyway (Supplier of food, supplier of paper cups, etc..., for a small cafe), then that's fine, but being a hub on the network specifically for being a hub?

As with any large transactions, you'll probably be asked where you got it and it might be held for a few hours/days, but other than that should be good.
Remember that faster payments only works under £250,000, and for some issuing banks under £20,000. If you go above this limit, they'll either wire you the money or send it via BACs, either way it'll take a few business days.

1. They're charging you for their own consolidation, which could be done at any time (I.E. when mempool is low)

3. They require BIP-70, which while isn't a terrible system (prevents a lot of user error), isn't something that should be forced on a user
Having said that though, I still do support them as least they do allow businesses to accept Bitcoin, even if they're not perfect.

Want to know my issue with hardware wallets? I own a TREZOR, and I keep some funds on it, but I still have a large(r) proportion of my funds on a paper wallet I generated a few years back and have since never imported onto a PC (Or transferred to my TREZOR).
The TREZOR is great against malware attacks, I'll give you that. However, what genuinely scares me is manufacturer attacks. The manufacturer knows that anyone who bought their device obviously has a large amount of BTC (Why'd I spent $100 to secure $5?), and on top of that, they can remotely push firmware updates via the website.
I'm just scared that they could push an update that silently steals the private keys/seed to the device. Hell, if they wanted to be super sneaky, since they already know the value each TREZOR contains (as wallet.trezor.io sends the addresses to their server to check the balance), only steal the top 100 people or so, so that security analysts who probably don't have millions on it receive a "legitimate" firmware blob, whereas hodlers with lots of money but (probably) little time to validate each build they receive get a malicious firmware blob.
May I ask what your thoughts on this are? I know I'm not a massive hodler, and don't have millions in BTC, but it'd still be scary for me to lose all of mine, which is exactly why I only keep a small amount on my TREZOR (That I might want to spend), then the larger portion on a paper wallet that "hasn't been stolen yet"^\(tm\) (But least can't receive firmware updates!).

But a £100 item doesn't cost £100. Even with the 2% discount. It should cost £98, but it costs [2,529,968 satoshi]( or at the current going rate of [£4,014.11/BTC](
2,529,968\*10^(-8)\*4,014.11 = £101.56
Onchain is even worse, due to the lack of the 2% discount.
With Amazon maybe I can understand (I believe they only offer partners a 2% discount), but the following merchants are all available at *double digit discounts* from other genuine vendors (admittedly without BTC as payment option):

Because the way the UI describes it:

Coordinator fee: 0.003% _per_ anonymity set
Having slept though, I do realize my calculation was wrong (I was calculating for a fee of .3%, not 0.003%), I should have done:
(1-((1-0.00003)^(50-2)))*100 = 0.143%
Which is much more reasonable. My mistake.


I do get that, which is why I think the different pool quantity (as you described below) is a good idea. Either that or some kind of reverse auction where the price starts high and lowers over time until you fulfil your requirement of ${X} many users.

    5^1 (1 CoinJoin round) = 5 possible outcomes, 1/5 = 20% chance of guessing input|output
    5^2 (2 CoinJoin rounds) = 25 possible outcomes, 1/25 = 4% chance of guessing input/output

Coinbase's fees aren't the worst either, assuming you're buying &gt;= to $200. In Europe it's around 1.49% for bank (verses ~ 0.25% for Coinify) and ~3.99% for debit card (verses ~ 3% for Coinify). In America it's around the same.

I'm not fond of KYC by any stretch, but I am interested in what your opinion of taxation is. Primarily:
1. Do you support personal (income/profit) tax? Why?
2. Do you support corporation (income/profit) tax? Why?
3. How do you think taxation systems could be improved?
4. If people have pure anonymity in finance, how would you recommend being able to collect tax?
5. If no tax was collected, how would you recommend being able to run free things "for the public"? For example: parks, education, health care, military, etc...
I'm not saying your wrong as I genuinely do not believe you are, but I do believe that KYC is a necessary evil and I do believe that having no regulations in the financial industry would cause pretty severe issues. Maybe there is a better solution than KYC, but I don't think "nothing" is that solution.

@_date: 2019-04-22 16:12:11
Fair enough, though one could argue that with such high fees (or ambiguous pricing (or mathematical error on my behalf)) that a 13.4% fee is too steep even for the rich and wealthy.
(1-((1-0.003)\^(50-2)))*100 = 13.4%
Additionally, my understanding with CoinJoin is that the more people participating the better the privacy, so surely it'd be better to have various CoinJoins for different values of mixing (0.0001BTC, 0.001BTC, 0.01BTC, 0.1BTC, 1BTC, 10BTC)?

So, out of interest I decided to give this a go (On Wasabi's implementation, as maybe I'm a little slow but I could not find it under Samourai's wallet). Unfortunately, it seems to only want to work with 0.1+ BTC (~$500). Is there anyway to test this with a lower amount, say $10-$30?
I understand why it makes more sense to use a higher amount (less % goes to miners, etc...), but I'm only trialing the software.

Just to add to this:


If this is indeed the correct fee, which let's be honest it's not (and I'm either making a mistake or the software is poorly worded), nobody would hide their coins "just because". Only someone with something to hide would use it.
Ultimately, privacy needs to be free if you want any chance of people using it (and you do, because if only people with malicious intent hide stuff, then the act of hiding becomes suspicious). It's already hard enough "in the real world" with things like Facebook Messenger and SMS being highly popular and more secure systems being not so.
So basically I'll stick to other methods of attempting to claim privacy. Obviously more privacy is better privacy, but $500-anunknownfee is too steep for me. I'd have been interested in trying it though, and I might try it on TESTNET just to give it a go.  
I just don't see it being something that the average person uses for all/most/any transactions which leads to the fact that most of the money you're mixing is probably tainted in of itself, if 100% of the inputs don't confirm to Coinbase's (or whoever else's) standards, then nor will any of the outputs.

Since nobody has answered your question rather than just mock you:
Electrum is a bitcoin "wallet", and Coinbase is an exchange. You use an exchange to convert USD(/other currencies) for BTC with other people, the exchange takes a small cut. Electrum is a wallet, what you use to store Bitcoin.
The actual transfer of Bitcoin takes ~10 minutes, assuming a high enough fee. If it takes seven days, obviously Coinbase (a centralised exchange, just a website, nothing official) is delaying it. Either ask them as to why it's taking seven days, or use a different exchange.

You are completely missing the whole point. I did not state Bitcoin was better than existing payment processing methods, I did not state that the best rates available were 2%+$0.30, I did not state that Square does not exist or isn't popular.
All I stated was the absolute fact that, using the numbers provided to me by OP and a flat 5% charge is better than a 2% charge plus $0.30 for a $4 transaction, as described by OP.
You are looking into this way too much and picking fights that don't exist. I am not stating the whole world should switch to Bitcoin as we have many hurdles to overcome before then, namely:
* Providing legislation, insurance and other bureaucratic elements to provide insured custodial accounts for people who do not wish to be "their own bank" (and take on all the risks that imposes)
* Upping the rate of transactions for global transactions with some sort of scalable system (Lightning looks promising at the moment)
* Somehow legislating and creating a credit system so people who currently rely on mortgages and credit cards can continue use with Bitcoin
* Working on improving the privacy of Bitcoin
So no, I don't believe that suddenly all coffee shops should take Bitcoin. I think that some should, yes, but only if the owners and customers understand what they're getting into, but you're jumping into this very "me vs them" and anyone who does not fully agree with you is the "opposition" and you must "prove them wrong". Calm down dude, stop starting fights.

My understanding, once again without any real knowledge of the project, is that you would broadcast a transaction with the device which other nodes would relay to other similar nodes. They would all do this without the internet, eventually a node which *does* have internet would relay your packet to the internet.
How reliable is it? I don't know, someone on Twitter claims it has a theoretical maximum range of 4KM, so as long as there's one user every 4KM (or less in a densely populated area with obstructions) it'll eventually get to someone who will relay to the internet.
Does this device have any sort of acknowledgment to the sender that the TX was broadcasted? Can it do that trustlessly? Am I talking shit and I completely misunderstood this project? Who knows!
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:25:16
But for a $4 transaction:
    $4 * 0.02 + $0.30 = $0.38
    $0.38/$4 = 9.5%
That's way higher than 5%.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:40:26
Full disclosure, I run a mainnet (and testnet) lightning node.
While I agree that some people might be slow to upgrade, I do feel that if the 1.0 release of Lightning somehow is harmed by the existence of out-of-date clients on a technical level, then the 1.0 release isn't reliable enough to be considered a 1.0 release. What I mean by this is, for example, if half the network is running {pre-alpha} and the other half is running 1.0, the 1.0 nodes should be able to determine that there are communications errors occurring with {pre-alpha} nodes and automatically route around them. If it doesn't do this, it is inherently an issue in the code that an attacker could use to bring down the network.
So, on a technical level I disagree, I see this as a non-issue. That leaves two more issues I can see:
1. Users running old versions might have issues when attempting to use the network in general
2. Users running new versions might have issues when attempting to send money to old users
The solutions to those are simple, for the first one, they knew what they were getting into and should upgrade. Easy-as, I genuinely believe that people will either be interested and motivated enough to update, or will be lazy enough to not really care about using Lightning, no middle ground^(1). For the second one, this could be an issue (users seeing errors when it's technically an out-of-date application they're trying to pay causing protocol issues), however, I feel like that's similar to saying that "people will start to distrust HTTP because every once in awhile a site goes down". I believe people will notice the fact that user XYZ isn't able to be communicated with, whereas every other user on the (growing) network is, thus determining that the issue is with XYZ's node.
1. At the moment, everyone on the mainnet (or even testnet) Lightning networks seems to be at-least decently technical. I don't think there are any users who accidentally ended up there without knowing what they're doing, meaning I believe everyone currently running a node knows how to upgrade a piece of software.

@_date: 2018-03-23 22:02:13
LN does, Bitcoin doesn't. I believe how it currently works (don't quote me, not a developer of Lightning) is when you close the channel, you have a X/1000 chance of rounding up. For example, if you had 1.5 Satoshis in a channel, you'd have a 50/50 chance of getting 1 or 2 Satoshis when closing the channel. Overall this randomness would even out.

This is using the [faster payment service]( and you can transfer up to £250k (depending on the bank's own limits) instantly.

I have never ever had issue spending money after it appears in my bank account, nor has anyone I know.
While I'm not disputing the money hasn't cleared, can you find any source that demonstrates that once the transfer has initialised there is any way of preventing the money from clearing, with the exception of the sending bank becoming broke (and even then I believe it'd still be processed and insured for up to £85k/person/account, admittedly delayed)?

Okay, few things people in this thread are really missing out on: You need to have channels open to use Lightning, so the experience will change for the end user in one of two(ish) ways:
1. They choose/the wallet chooses to run in "autopilot" mode, where it automatically opens channels as it sees fit to allocate a percentage of your money onto the network.
2. They choose/the wallet chooses to wait until it's making a lightning channel transaction, then if it is unable to find a route, generate a new channel that would create a route
3. The same as  but also allocate extra money for "next time"
The UI will look basically identical as current, except you'll use Lightning invoices rather than Bitcoin addresses, and, depending on the above situation:
1. You'll notice your BTC balance will occasionally drop a bit, reflecting the price it costs to open channels. Lightning will be fast every time you use it. If you try and spend too much (I.E. If you have 1BTC total, 0.5BTC on chain and 0.5BTC in payment channels, and you try and spend 0.75BTC) you'll get either an error or something that says "We have to delay this payment while we create more/remove some payment channels"
2. Lightning won't be instant the first time you route to anyone, but if you then get paid through Lightning you'll then be able to make your next payment faster. Same issue occurs if you don't have enough funds on chain/in payment channels, you'll have to wait to close/open some channels. This has the benefit of your balance not randomly dropping though.
3. Lightning won't be instant the first time you route to people, but the more payments you make the faster it will get, other than that, same as 
At-least, that's my understanding of it.
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:47:38
More than likely the Lightning app you use will increase routing fees directly related to how much money is in the channel.
Let's say you have 0.01BTC in all sides of all channels:
`A &lt;--A:0.01 B:0.01--&gt; B &lt;--B:0.01 C:0.01--&gt; C`
Then B might choose to charge a standard 1sat routing fee. Let's say A sends 0.009 to C:
`A &lt;--A:0.0009 B:0.0191--&gt; B &lt;--B:0.001 C:0.019--&gt; C`
B might then choose to charge A a large amount of money (say 100 sat) to route through him to C, but choose to actually pay C a smaller amount (say 500msat) to route backwards through him. C will then prioritize routing through B through A, assuming the monetary incentive is higher than the added cost of routing a sub-optimal route, to route into the "Lightning network" for future payments rebalancing the route in question.
I think this is how it works, anyway, I'm not a lightning dev.

Because PayPal is a valid alternative to wire transfers, especially when you need to money in your bank account A.S.A.P. to pay for services that normally do not take Bitcoin (phone bills, rent, etc...).


I don't honestly know what you're talking about, PayPal is instant. It's faster than Bitcoin. This is obviously because it's centralised and not trustless, but it is instant.


The fees are bad, but not terrible. ~£0.60 to send from a credit card and ~£0.10 to send from a debit card, assuming international. National, debit cards are free.


This I can't defend, their exchange rates are extremely poor. Circle has better exchange rates, and that's what I use for sending money to friends/family.


I admit that trust systems aren't as good as Bitcoin's trustless network, but in my experience I've only ever seen people with unverified accounts be locked. I'm not saying only that happens, but it's certainly a larger percentage.


So do I, but they obviously also have to pay for Lawyers, work with card providers (Mastercard, Visa, etc...). It's not as simple as "we're going to lower the price".

@_date: 2018-04-03 12:50:26


As will your Lightning channels be refilled from your on-chain wallets automatically (if configured). So, basically indisquitishable for users in this regard.


Definitively. I am not arguing that, requiring private keys and seeds and "oh if you fuck up you'll lose your money" is horrible UX.


I mean, Bitcoin already does replace bank wires in my genuine opinion, assuming both parties are willing to accept it. Its instability is an issue, but excluding that Bitcoin beats wire transfers out of the water.
I do believe another of Bitcoin's legitimate use cases is as an additional payment scheme to credit/debit cards. Not replacing them, but if both the company and the user wishes to, accepting Lightning payments. It reduces fees and negates chargebacks.


Don't remind me, I've only ever had to do two international bank transfers (one SEPA and one wire), both made me squirm with how awkward it all was. Even large national payments are awkward (I had a bank call me on three separate days to confirm I still wanted to do the transaction, and had the payment delayed by a week). I understand it's in the name of "security", but it hurt.


I want to see a future with programmable money (and I don't mean APIs, as some banks already offer APIs, I'm talking smart contracts). I really do think it's an amazingly cool concept that could really open up some insanely interesting ideas (such as "streaming" money), but I want to get there in a manner that is user-friendly and secure. Not jumping skips and bounds.

What country is that? UK it's always instant, and free, to withdraw. PayPal claims it takes 2 hours, but I've never had it take longer than 30 seconds. Circle has better exchange rates than PayPal (and no fees, unlike PayPal), but they take 30 minutes to withdraw which is a bit of a downside. Maybe take a look at them, Assuming you're transferring to/from the UK/US/Europe, as I believe that's their market.

I wrote this script for lnd on my mainnet, working quite well. I have ~50 channels:
`reset &amp;&amp; for i in {1..1000}; do while [ "$(~/Downloads/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.4-beta/lncli walletbalance | jq -r '.total_balance')" -le "123456" ]; do echo 'Sleeping...'; sleep 1s; done; curl -s ' | jq -r '.nodes[] | "\(.pub_key) | .addr)"' | parallel -j256 --eta --bar 'curl --max-time 12 --fail -s {= s/.* =}; if [ "${?}" -eq "56" ]; then echo "{}"; fi' | sort | uniq | sort -R | parallel --eta --bar -j8 --timeout 5m '~/Downloads/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.4-beta/lncli openchannel --connect {= s/^.* =} --local_amt 123456 --sat_per_byte 1 "{= s/ =}" 2&gt;/dev/null'; done`
^ Replace the two instances of "123456" to the amount you want to create per channel, and replace sat_per_byte to whatever fee wish to use to create the onchain transactions.
After starting `lnd` for the first time in around 24 hours and giving it one minute (and not running anything, not even the above script), I have ~10 channels as "false" and the rest as "true". You can count how many with this script:
`./lncli listchannels | jq -r '.channels[].active' | sort | uniq -c`

Not exactly. UK banks charge money to send to Europe, and some (though it's rarer) charge to receive.
Most also give shit exchange rates, and mandate a conversion from EUR-&gt;GBP or expect £10/month to keep a EUR account open. There are some that don't do this (I think revult lets you keep your EUR for free? Starling/Monzo claim they have decent exchange rates, not 100%)

"Maybe". Chargebacks on Lightning aren't possible, but there's a higher risk of losing your funds. If you're offline for an extended period of time (and don't employ the use of a watchtower service) then the other party could maliciously steal all money in all your channels.
That's just assuming there are no bugs, new software, always online, routing random payments, etc..., all might be vulnerable to bugs.

This is using the [faster payment service]( and you can transfer up to £250k (depending on the bank's own limits) instantly. Also: "Faster Payments are processed in matter of seconds and once your payment is sent, it cannot be stopped or reversed". I have never ever had issue spending money after it appears in my bank account, nor has anyone I know.
While I'm not disputing the money hasn't cleared, can you find any source that demonstrates that once the transfer has initialised there is any way of preventing the money from clearing, with the exception of the sending bank becoming broke (and even then I believe it'd still be processed and insured for up to £85k/person/account, admittedly delayed)?

Fair enough, I see your confusion, I will try and explain. I do admit that it is a downside and I can't rebrand it as a "feature", but maybe I can explain why it occurs and give you a "real world" example of it:
Imagine that your on-chain wallet is your large purchase account and your lightning wallet is your micropayment account. Sort of similar to a bank account and a credit card. Bank accounts you can do very large payments but they take a little while to do so (~10 minutes to 72 hours, depending on the amount of money).
Credit cards, on the other hand, are almost immediate (for validation, clearing takes longer but we'll ignore that for this demonstration).
You rarely go into a shop and pay for your coffee via bank transfer, because it's inconvenient, but you do go into a shop and pay for your coffee with card, and then pay off your card with a bank transfer. That will be similar to how Lightning will work:
If you have money in your on chain wallet (I.E. bank account), and it's a large transaction, you probably will be happy waiting 10 minutes or so for a confirmation to validate that it succeeded. Examples of this would be when you'd use your bank account to buy something IRL, like maybe large purchases from retailers (£5k+).
If you have money in lightning payment channels (I.E. Credit cards), and it's a small transaction, you probably will want to route the payment A.S.A.P. so you can continue on with your day (like a coffee, for example).
Obviously, Lightning isn't a form of credit so you can't "borrow" money and pay it back at the end of each month from your on-chain wallet, so you will need to prepay. In this example, you may choose to allocate 20% of your available wallet into these payment channels. As long as you don't want to spend more than the 20% of your money in payment channels before you refill it, or as long as you don't want to spend more than the 80% of your money on chain before you withdraw some money from payment channels, then you're golden.
If you do, then, yes, unfortunately, you will have to wait a little while (though as long as everyone is cooperating, it should only be the length of 1 on-chain transaction to get 3 confirmations to deposit, no confirmations to withdraw (as you can spend an unconfirmed transaction, it just will delay the latter transaction until the prior is confirmed))
Is it great? No. Is it workable? Yeah. I'm going to defend it a little and say, I rarely spend 20% of the value I have in BTC in one day on small purchases, or 80% of the value I have in BTC in one day on large purchases. I think it's a perfectly acceptable system and can't criticize too much.

I would _not_ keep large amounts of money in a Lightning wallet.
Until watchtowers are implemented if you go offline for longer than the `remote_csv_delay` you gave your partner long enough to broadcast an old state of the channel and steal your money.
If my understanding of channel factories is correct, once channel factories are a thing I think this will change a lot (cold channel factory between you &amp; someone else, with an inner channel that you keep hot).

No, but opening a channel is. This costs money (as it's an on-chain transaction). Channel factories are probably more what you're looking for, it allows one on-chain transaction to open multiple channels between a bunch of users (for example, you &amp; a bunch of your friends), however there's not many pieces of software available to create them yet.

Why do you think having fewer on chain transactions is bad? Remember that on boarding new users onto Lightning still requires a transaction so miners shouldn't be out of pocket.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:21:20
I have no idea why you're being downvoted. For on-chain transactions, this is the unfortunate truth.
However, for Lightning transactions it isn't, though unfortunately there doesn't seem to be many well orchestrated, easy to deploy self-hosted Lightning payment processors out there at the moment. You've really got three options:
1. Use a third party payment processor (almost certainly what any non-BTC company will do, especially as they can probably pay you in fiat)
2. Use a self-hosted, but less than perfect, self-hosted solution like BTCPayServer (which works really well for on-chain transactions, but their Lightning implementation isn't *great*)
3. Write your own code on top of a Lightning implementation (`lnd`, `eclair` or `clightning` -- similar to what BTCPayServer does). This has the same limitations as BTCPayServer but at least makes sure the developer knows what they're doing and allows them to mitigate them (like closing channels via the API to transfer to an exchange^(1))
None of these solutions are great for the above technical reasons, but also because you're still dealing with a very volatile currency. These are the reasons which *I personally* believe that Lightning isn't being used for services where Lightning would be perfect (See: JustEat, Amazon Prime Now, Uber, etc...).
^(1) - Once exchanges start support Lightning I really do believe that Lightning usage will grow. As of current I know a lot of people only keep a small percentage of their hot wallet as Lightning channel balance because that's how they received their BTC from the exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-24 01:21:27
Because you used a custodial wallet. This means you're just connected to somebody else's node who manages channels and the funds aren't yours (simply BlueWallet promises they'll do what you say with *their* funds in your "account"). This is similar to keeping Bitcoin in an exchange.

No, there are a lot of risks. There are:

2. You being malicious and the address being replaced.
3. Denial of Service of the website ruining the system
4. No validation of data end-to-end, meaning corruption of data (I.E. the address) could occur (though the checksum for the address *should* catch this)

If you can come up with a way that allows free, trustless payments that runs on the same level of hardware that runs today, I would highly recommend you start talking about it with people.
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:07:28
Yeah, the Lightning network is there. It's not _recommended_, but hey, it's completely usable at the moment. It has some caveats however, primarily:
* Backups aren't really a thing yet (as channels change constantly, and an old backup will result in all your funds being stolen by the other party (by design)).
* Splicing doesn't exist yet (I.E. add/remove money from the Lightning network without forming a whole new channel)
* Channel factories don't exist yet (I.E. Having more than one channel exist per on-chain transaction)
If you want a site to play around with Lightning, [Lightning Roulette]( [Bottle]( and [Lightning Network Stores]( are a few good things to try around.
You won't be able to withdraw this on a non-custodial wallet without getting some inbound capacity, but if you use a custodial one such as BlueWallet you should be able to:

This. Cannot recommend BTCPayServer enough.

Bitcoin is a push system, not pull. You can't setup things like Direct Debit which is kind of a shame. Hopefully applications built on Lightning will allow a Direct Debit-esk system where I can say "Hey, Google is allowed to take $2/month for Google Drive" or even "Hey, Google is allowed to take $0.00005/minute for Google Drive".
As of current though, assuming you want to get your fingers dirty, you can script stuff. Here's an example script I just made to demonstrate donations to BTCPay Server:
     bash
    
    if [[ -z "${1}" ]]; then
    	echo "ERROR: Missing satoshi donation value";
    	exit 3;
    fi;
    
    SAT_VALUE="${1}"
    BTC_VALUE="$(bc &lt;&lt;&lt; "scale=8; ${SAT_VALUE}*10^-8")"
    
    echo "Acquiring invoice ID..."
    
    BTCPAY_INVOICE_ID="$(curl -si -H 'accept: text/html' --data "storeId=EErYwCthBNfJUpuU1etH1uhg3x1YVH1q1F2zez7u1AAX&amp;price=${BTC_VALUE}&amp;currency=BTC" ' | grep 'location: ' | sed 's|^location:  | tr -d '\r' | tr -d '
')"
    
    if [[ -z "${BTCPAY_INVOICE_ID}" ]]; then
    	echo "ERROR: Unable to acquire invoice ID"
    	exit 1;
    fi;
    
    echo "Acquiring invoice payment request..."
    
    BTCPAY_INVOICE_URL="
    
    echo "Processing invoice payment request..."
    
    LIGHTNING_INVOICE="$(curl -s "${BTCPAY_INVOICE_URL}" | jq -r '.btcAddress')"
    LIGHTNING_INVOICE_SAT_VALUE="$(lncli decodepayreq "${LIGHTNING_INVOICE}" | jq -r '.num_satoshis')"
    
    if [[ "${LIGHTNING_INVOICE_SAT_VALUE}" -eq "${SAT_VALUE}" ]]; then
    	echo "Paying invoice payment request..."
    	lncli payinvoice --force --pay_req "${LIGHTNING_INVOICE}"
    else
    	echo "ERROR: Payment invoice satoshi value differs from expected";

Pruning solves a lot of issues, yes, but the only way to create a pruned node is to download all the blocks, verify them, then discard the information you personally deem unneeded (for most people, the STXO set). You can only do this from a full node.
Another reason for capping block sizes is that free/cheaper transactions can lead to larger UXTO sets. Nobody would consolidate their funds if it made no difference either way. This means that pruned nodes would end up having to store a larger UXTO set.
However, obviously the biggest reason for not changing the block size is that it requires a hard fork so unless you convince everyone of your change you're out of luck.

However, obviously they _could_ lie and say that team  won when team  actually did.

@_date: 2019-05-25 16:12:51
But you can't really "skip" on-chain payments, can you?
I know channel factories will let one on-chain payment create unlimited off-chain payment channels, but those channels can only be within the people inside the channel factory and if any participant of the channel factory is malicious/goes offline then you can no longer use the channel factory (and have to broadcast everything to the chain). This means it is infeasible for an exchange to have one *massive* channel factory with all its users.
Or am I wrong?

Unfortunately though I don't think many people who own 1+ BTC are keeping them all in one address, so these websites underestimate the higher values and over estimate the lower values by a large amount.

Considering he's in the UK, [SumUp]( has a 3G card reader (I.E. data included) for £69 flat-fee, plus 1.69% of any transactions through the system (including American Express - one of the most expensive cards due to their cashback schemes).
I've always wanted to accept card, but ultimately with any business regularly doing transactions higher than £100 or so I feel like the fees are too high unless you can negotiate directly with the card providers. On top of this, chargebacks are scary and so bank transfers are what I'm left with (fast, free and from what I can tell, hard*er* to chargeback).

I don't believe they will because of the low income involved, but if this becomes large what stops a miner from specifically mining a certain number of transactions in order to win the jackpot?

To be fair though, not all of those would be valid in terms of the checksums. Assuming that you could skip all non-valid seeds for free (I.E. no computational power, which to be fair in terms of a ratio of looking up addresses from a seed in a very large database vs checking a simple to compute checksum, it genuinely kind of is), it'd be more like:
    (24!/2^8/1000000000)seconds
or a measly [76,802 years]( Less if you assume you don't get stupidly unlucky and have it be the very last seed possible.
Also remember that some seeds contain duplicate words, which actually lowers it a bit as well (Because `alpha alpha beta` is the same as `alpha alpha beta`, even though the two `alpha`s are switched around). This, though, obviously depends on the 24 mnemonic words.
But, for example, I'm sure even a Raspberry Pi could crack all possible combinations of:

The buyer has to trust that the arbitrator isn't colluding with the seller. The seller has to trust that the arbitrator isn't colluding with the buyer.
Unfortunately, there's no trustless way to import "real world" data (such as fiat transfers) into Bitcoin smart contracts (with some exceptions that I don't believe applies here, such as oracles) without trusting somebody. Ultimately, both the buyer and the seller need to choose an arbitrator that they trust. Alternatively, though I do not believe Bisq has implemented it, you could actually have multiple arbitrators, for example a panel of three where two would have to agree. The script would look similar to:
(Buyer &amp; Seller) || (Buyer &amp;&amp; (2-of-3(Arb1, Arb2, Arb3))) || (Seller &amp;&amp; (2-of-3(Arb1, Arb2, Arb3)))

The point is that Bitcoin's goal is to attempt to scale well in terms of who can actually run a full node. Bitcoin Cash's goal is to attempt to scale immediately as to who can transact with it.
The fear from the Bitcoin developers is that if you make the block size too large then it limits who can run a full node, which is the whole point of "being your own bank". If you needed to buy a new £100 hard drive every day/week/month/year/whatever it simply adds a limitation which doesn't (yet) need to exist.
The other reason why increasing the blocksize (and thus reducing the fees) is a bad idea as of current is that it seems to be a relatively naive approach. It's akin to having two USB1 ports instead of developing USB2. This is what layer 2 and 3 systems such as Lightning and channel factories are trying to resolve.
Nobody is saying that the block size will never increase, as I'm sure it will one day, people are just saying that we have so much untapped potential in the already existing block size that there's no reason to increase the size now.

Which part are you confused about? The buyer? The seller? The cryptocurrency? The fiat? Massive oversimplification:
Maker and taker lock the value of the trade + a holding fee (~10%, I believe) + miner fee + Bisq's fee in a 2-of-3 multisig address. Fiat (assuming you're paying via fiat) is then sent directly from the buyer to the seller. Once the seller confirms receipt, they sign their part of the 2-of-3 multisig and give it to the buyer who can then sign and broadcast the transaction.
[If there's a dispute]( then the pre-agreed arbitrator (the 3rd person in the 2-of-3 multisig) will review the case and sign one party's signature.

In practice there tends not to be any issues real issues but things like pay to script hash (p2sh, addresses starting with `3`) reveal the script. There was one issue with a wallet (can't remember which one) that was exploited due to poor number randomisation, meaning address reuse allows determination of the private key, but in reality that was an implementation error.
You just shouldn't reuse addresses for privacy. There's no need to.

No. There's no negativity of storing a large amount of BTC in a single address other than your own privacy. Though, it's unlikely that having large amounts of BTC in a single address will happen naturally. You'd have to purposely consolidate your funds which damages your privacy and thus is something I doubt many people would do with large amounts of money. This assumes you didn't simply buy a large sum of Bitcoin at once, in which case the exchange would pay you as one UXTO
As for storing a large amount of money in a single wallet, this really depends. Ultimately I'd say unless you're extremely privacy conscious it'd be fine. Even if you are privacy conscious, then storing transactions in the same wallet wouldn't be the end of the world as long as you are aware of which UXTO you are spending together. Wallets like Wasabi Wallet make coin selection extremely easy and track where all your coins have ever been seen.
In terms of security though, I wouldn't buy a new wallet for each BTC. That'd be very expensive and not benefit your security much at all. If I was paranoid, I'd maybe consider having a "hot"/"cold"/"glacier" system though, for example a hot wallet being a Wasabi/Electrum/Samourai wallet, a cold wallet being a Trezor/Ledger, and a glacier wallet being a CryptoSteel/whatnot.
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:40:35
Because of the way Bitcoin fundamentally works. You have to spent a transaction output, you can't spend less and you can't spend more. You can however spend multiple transaction outputs (to merge funds).
Why was it designed that way? Just because it was. The other option would mean that instead of tracking transactions (and UXTOs) you'd be tracking addresses which were credited by transactions and while I can't say I've thought about it much, it sounds like more of a challenge to keep track of user's balances.

Things like channel factories will reduce the pricing in some regard. Additionally, batching creation transactions between multiple users (which is basically a slightly different channel factories are) and Schnorr signatures will reduce fees as well. Ultimately though scaling is a never-ending game, nothing will ever "solve it".

Be aware some of these values are calculated from the transaction, rather than actually being embedded in the transaction.

I'm not going to claim anything (as although I've read their descriptions of everything, I haven't 100% understood it myself), but they claim it's a trustless method of mixing your funds via CoinJoin. You never lose control of your funds as you only ever sign a transaction that originates from an address you control and terminates at an address you control.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:02:38
Yes, just make a smart contract that is roughly:
1. Checks signature (`OP_CHECKSIG`)
2. Else (`OP_NOTIF`, I believe)
3. Checks multisig results and returns those (`OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY`)
4. `OP_VERIFY`
Or something like that
No idea if there's a user friendly way of doing it though, but it's definitely possible.

Yeah, though for me (relativelyish well connected node, `lncli listchannels | jq '.channels | length'` &gt;= 5, `lncli listchannels | jq -r '.channels[].local_balance' | paste -sd+ | bc` &gt;= 2,000,000 and `lncli listchannels | jq -r '.channels[].remote_balance' | paste -sd+ | bc` &gt;= 100,000) that percentage of payment is way further down at maybe 1%. Though, to be fair I mainly do small transactions (sub £5).
Any time I've had a payment fail (TEMPORARY_CHANNEL_FAILURE, or whatever it's called) no funds are transferred.

HodlHodl isn't a decentralised exchange, it's a P2P exchange which I do admit is a little confusing as P2P is also a term for decentralisation.
HodlHodl is a centralised exchange (I.E. 1 entity runs the servers that displays the website), but people pay each other instead of the site. For example, if Alice is buying Bitcoin from Bob, Alice pays Bob directly and not HodlHodl. This makes it peer (Alice) to peer (Bob) in terms of money. It is still client/server in terms of technology.
Bisq is a decentralised exchange (or at least what they tell people, I have not read the source code). This means that you connect to the individual PCs of the people buying/selling money to negotiate, rather than using a centralised server. This means it's highly resistant against takedown requests (which would have to take down the tracker) or DoS attacks.
I might be wrong though.

Also remember that databases are efficient at indexed lookups. Once you have built the chainstate, you just query it for a TXID. You do not need to read all of it to get the data you want.

17 sat is 0.00000017btc.
Anyway, there are already terms. BTC, millibtc, microbtc, satoshi. They're already in use, it depends on the scale of the transaction.

Yeah, I got hit with that. Ended up just doing a transaction to LND on my desktop and deleting the app.

Website seems very buggy. For example, on the listing page it states a user wants [30BTC/hour]( but when I click on the user it states [$30/hour](

Take that up with BitRefill. It's their pricing, not Eclair's. I've found their exchange rate is always higher than pretty much every exchange's going rate.


How many channels do you have? Are they of value greater than that of what you want to spend? Who are they with?
