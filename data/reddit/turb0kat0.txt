Didnt check for three days... market tanked 40%!  Never doing that again.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:37:20
I don’t get it.

Sadly if the deep state owns 1 million and it hits $1 million/coin, that will only cover about 5% of the national debt.   Or 1% by then.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:31:53
By doing wut?
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:49:03
Agree but other coins are really struggling to get any transaction volume at all.  LTC is really the only one with any traffic to speak of and it doesnt solve much.
Turns out real world adoption as a currency is actually still hard.
Still time for BTC, but the clock is ticking.

Meltdown is patched spectre is largely not patched as all attack vectors are not known
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:32:28
Most big exchange wallets are known
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:40:56
They moved somewhere
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:10:42
Yeah i mean devoid of the burdens of operating the state on behalf of the people, the deep state could easily run a tremendously powerful global arms syndicate using their newfound crypto wealth.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:40:47
I seem to missing some context.  Is there some bitcoin product coming to NYSE?

Don’t forget about all the uxto cleanup

Probably just a trader looking to take advantage of anyone buying large market orders
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:21:50
They just want to capture as many accounts as they can while the space is up for grabs.  They do not (and should not, IMO) really care which bits are on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:32:00
That is insane...  seems super easy to manipulate?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:28:02
Using blockchain for identification is a long rumored killer app.  Would be surprising to see microsoft move in on bitcoin instead of ethereum chain given their deep involvement in ethereum space.  
Microsoft execs are notorious for being narcissistic assholes.  I am mildly surprised to see it spilling over onto twitter in such an obviously inappropriate way as leaking internal information and bashing competitors.

Dark bro.  Upvote.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:06:58
Really this is the whole reason we need crypto
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:38:56
Forex trading 5.1 trillion per day.
So crypto is about 1%

You had me at brunch

I suspect coinbase continues to grow in spite of some angry early adopters moving off platform.  
Legitimacy of platform is a non sequitur.  But they are fully compliant and audited by us government, unlike mtgox ever was and unlike most of the other exchanges that people are “flocking to”
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:00:46
Quite possibly true.  Good line of questioning above about Coinbase economic incentives to fraction.  A lending business on fractional sounds lucrative.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:34:35
1000 points not a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:44
Coinbase has fantastic engineers working on the problems that will optimize the profit equation for their company:  scaling and onboarding new currencies.  And before that security: a breach of which destroys their whole company.   
Fees are only relevent to them if it is costing them customers.  Right now the value add from being the only broker who can trivially exchange fiat for crypto makes them the best option for most investors.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:03:38
Omg how did no one else ask this, most vital, question??
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:02
Hard to explain the complexity of big engineering projects on reddit.  Nice job :)

Compare to forex trading volumes make more sense

Satoshi now worth over $11 billion...

They can have life changing positive gains and also remain a laggard.  Just look at India or brazil past 3 decades.

Bought   Since then.  Sat on my ass.  Do nothing.  Wait.  Check back in the 2020s.

Probably at least a billion people do!  Fiat will take a very long time to die, at best.

Now they just need a venmo like app and crypto will be ubiquitous
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:15:51
Not exactly what he said
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:22:25
Hmm didnt even know they ipo
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:45:44
Yeah sad I missed it!  Been following Square as a private unicorn forever and missed the IPO! :(
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:21:49
Google Monaco and Coinbase and see which you think is relevant.
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:14:03
Mempool is empty because traffic is 50% lower than any time in the lat 2 years.  Pretty insane given the growth in crypto over that time period.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:47:38
Are we dead yet?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:59:18
Like 500% since ipo last year.  Wish I had noted this earlier!
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:13:27
Thanks to ethereum taking 70% of txn and bch taking another 5%.  Thanks bch and ethereum!
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:25:54
Lol!  About the same.  Thx for sharing.

If it keeps tripling every month that is about 9 months out.  By the time it hits single digit there will be an insane about of hype and it will be on CNBC every day.

LN is def not ready for scale, but good progress.
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:51:32
Lightning btc and on chain btc are separate markets.  Will be interesting to see if price diverges.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:00:25
You can tell the timeframe by looking at the coin count.  It is June 2018...
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:20:49
Some laws and lawmaking bodies are trying to protect consumers from getting swindled.  
Others are to protect the military and police’ ability to monitor and track criminal activities.
Others are trying to protect governments from the economic havoc could wreak on their existing monetary systems.  
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:13:16
Liquidity constraints on chain could cause it to trade at a significant discount vs lightning.  Bad actors or govt controls on LN could cause it to trade at a significant discount vs on chain.  Differences will get arbitraged but may persist for extended periods.
