There is something i made, i hope you can strip it yourself. I really have to go to a meeting.
There is where I got them from, I left off on 2010 ( i didnt grab any words from 2010 yet)
It goes to 2000. I would write a script to scrape and clean them but i really have to go. Check beautifulsoup4
if it works send btc to seans outpost plz thanks, or donate in your own way to something else.

This link is better:
edit: Btw I fully expect to see these coins moved by the end of the day. This seems much too simple.
I don't need the BTC, so if someone out there reads this article and has the know how (and needs the BTC, don't be greedy) then do it.
don't even need to scan the blockchain.
good luck
oh btw i already tried ssdbadasseryhiggs[0-9] and it didn't work :'(
