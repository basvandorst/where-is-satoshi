Is your business just buying and selling BTC?
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:57:02
Ah yes. I do this also.

I would think buying off locals would be bad for business considering the price on localbitcoins (at least where I am) is at least %15. Is that how it is where you are?

You can use a site like purse.io that will let you put an ad of sorts out for someone to buy you one on Amazon and ship it to you. Then you will pay them the price in bitcoin. You will get to choose a discount as well because you can set the bitcoin buy price.

Do you have a link or source on how to do this? I keep looking for easy to follow instructions but I cant seem to get it to go well.
@_date: 2014-12-04 04:02:12
You should check out purse.io

Awesome, as an ISU student I hope this gets more people into the world of bitcoin, lets hope other small business will follow your lead.

I wonder how much extra the lunch cost when you add the fees
@_date: 2015-08-29 19:55:25
228.65 usd

Oh boy Tuesday already?! 
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:13:07
Yeah I would love even a full on tutorial. You can't beat a $35 portable node.

Any Expert would know not to use a wallet that came in a lego box.

Why can't every day be tipping Tuesday?

That has to be some sort of scam. That website just screams it.

Once you get USD accounts integrated, you could remove the 1% fee for bitcoin, and leave the fees for USD transfers. That might make people more likely to possibly just hold onto the bitcoin for future bets. Sure that lowers your revenue so it might not seem as appealing to you.

Lets just hope the price rises with every bit you give
@_date: 2015-10-07 02:13:08
That seems like a solid plan. I didn't think about the not having fees for not moving bitcoin in/out, and that alone could get people to use bitcoin over USD if they use the app a lot. I see why you would have the fees in the first place, (mostly) everyone wants to get paid for their work. If anything you could just do like "first X trades fee free" or something. All in all very interesting app and ill keep it downloaded to watch the development. Good luck!

With this plus the Openbazzar release comming soon, people are going to be able to use bitcoin for every part of their online selling methods.
