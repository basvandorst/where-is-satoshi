How can you ignore the tens of thousands of trades placed by bots and suggest this was nothing more than demand?

I disagree completely.
I think there are mounds of technical and time-consuming barriers to entry for Bitcoin.
I have several great ideas I'd like to implement, but because I don't have the security prowess, I will have to put them on hold. I'm not stupid enough to take people's money (BTC) without having it up to the best standards of security.

I believe if you have sold the BTC for USD, even though it is sitting in an intermediary account you would have to report those gains. If you put it back into BTC, you would not.
That said, for me personally, I'm not going to worry about it until I withdraw to my account any funds, because I find it highly unlikely that they will link any of those funds to me on my taxes.

- *A sating of demand*  
  [Demand is only growing exponentially for these, just look at Google Search Popularity](
- *A drop in the price of Bitcoin (for whatever reason)*  
  A price drop will cause a price drop...?
- *A Bitcoin counterfeiting or hacking or theft scare.*  
  We already had one, the price dropped a fair bit and rebounded even higher in minutes with a smaller pool. It will be even harder to shake now.
- *A government crackdown on Bitcoins.*  
  I believe this is the only true way to stop bitcoins at this point. If the big banks and such get worried they will try to lobby against it. Hopefully enough heavy-weight investors get in the game beforehand to prevent this.
- *An increase in the supply of Bitcoins.*  
  Just an all around stupid statement.
- *A better Bitcoin (or even just another Bitcoin)*  
  There are about a dozen cryptocurrencies already moving forward, but none with the momemtum and success of Bitcoin.

When I went into Chase to get money for some Bitcoins today, the Vice President of the branch told me he thought it was too risky.
He said it was because Bitcoins aren't backed by anything.
I immediately asked what the USD is backed by.
He said gold.

Oh wow, where to begin.
How long is too long in terms of demand? We've only just begun according to Google's metrics. There are BILLIONS of people on this planet.
Just because you can imagine the worst possible nuclear holocaust, does not mean it is plausible. Sure there are risks on the bitcoin exchanges, sure it's not a perfect system, but it's core is solid.
What does the amount of bitcoins have to do with anything? Their value just goes up the less that are actually used.
To say something has success, is not the same as saying it is A success. You should probably stick with school.
I won't even acknowledge the pyramid scheme statement because of it's sheer stupidity.

Their website, the speed, the design, it's horrible by 1999 standards.
They have links to unfinished parts, confusing labels and screens that make no sense.
The site runs slower than my prodigy Back in 1991, no exaggeration.
They have made 0 improvements to their site in months, and their tech support can take a week to even respond to the highest level of ticket.
They are unclear on their approval process and unhelpful with any progress.
With the lack of updates to their website, I have a feeling they are done spending on this company and taking their profits as they roll in.
This post is my official guess that campBX is "bit floored" before the year is up.

I don't even think you know what the word fundamentally means.
The currency is sound, nothing was hacked, altered, crashed, stopped, or hindered in any way by all of this volume. In fact, this last surge just proved that it is *fundamentally sound* if nothing else.
The problems all lie within the bitcoin exchanges, nothing more.
When you solve the problem of DDoS and bot purchasing/selling it will be a lot more stable a market.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:33:45

@_date: 2013-06-30 00:31:31
Download the latest cgminer from here: 
I use 3.2.2 fine, but 3.3.1 will probably be better.
You will want to use WinUSB drivers, for hot plug on these devices.
If for some reason the drivers are not installed correctly you can download Zadig here:  and use that to force install WinUSB drivers for the specific device. (**Note: Be very careful with this software! You can destroy your machine!**)
Now, you can open up notepad and create a batch file to run cgminer, mine looks like this:
    C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\Desktop\Mining\cgminer-3.2.2-windows\cgminer-nogpu.exe -o  -u &lt;Username&gt;.&lt;Worker&gt; -p &lt;Password&gt; -o mint.bitminter.com:8332 -u &lt;Username&gt;_&lt;Worker&gt; -p &lt;Password&gt;
    pause
Save that as Worker.bat and put that on your desktop. You will need to fill in the correct directory and all the usernames / passwords for your accounts. I have two pools set to mine, in case Slush's Pool goes down, it switches to bitminter.
To set up Slush's Pool, visit  and make an account.
To set up BitMinter's Pool, visit  (I use my Google login for simplicity.)
You will need to create a worker for each one, and set up a password for each worker. These are simply like sub accounts for your main account.
In your pool website, you can also automatically set them up to withdraw BTC to your BTC wallet address after a certain threshold. I personally like to have it withdraw once a day, so I estimate how much I mine and set it just below that amount.
To create a wallet, I recommend using  and starting a new wallet. **I only ever open my wallet using the Chrome Extension  . There is also a FireFox extension available here  , though I have never used it.
My understanding is that the extension will (help) prevent a man-in-the-middle attack, where someone highjacks your javascript using flash/java/some other exploit. This is not a joke, it is a requirement IMO.
Finally, after your pool, is setup, your wallet is setup, and your pool is pointing to your wallet, you should be able to launch your Worker.bat file, and have cgminer plug away.
I might go into more detail about setting up your pool account if people want.

BTC was about $10 / USD at the time.
Shares look like they initially traded for 0.1BTC / Share
