It starts to get hard to understand which of these things are funded by- tax on my labor, versus the hidden tax of inflation via printing money and the debasing of currency I earn from working and weakened purchasing power for that which I spend on living.

Yes ive seen info on pentagon and their so-called "adjustments"
Fyi, i personally dont have a problem with RT, i think almost all sources are bias in some form, but i have noticed a general rejection of RT as a source from many and it can impact the "credibility" of what youre saying, regardless if its fact or not. Anyway this information you mentioning IS verifiable on other sources, i believe even .gov sites, maybe even the pentagon itself.

Thanks but I think this can apply, it will probably be a good discussion. Bitcoin is sound money, its good to have a contrasting currency to understand that in real-world context. I just read a post the other day talking about Austrian Economics and how bitcoin is one of the first major realizations of that theory.

Are not CNN, CNBC, et al. bias for interests of the American state? If you were to say RT is more bias in this comparison, thats fine, but thats the point- All these sources are bias, you can weight them if you want but my opinion is that "skeptical automatically" can and maybe should be applied to almost all sources. This is not fatalist, it just means to aggregate sources, try to confirm through redundancy, consensus.

Its US space force duh! Though I chuckle at your reference.

Yes, no question that certain agencies would have no problem figuring out identity in regards to a crime. 
My question is more about tax implications for example

Exactly right, how does one do p2p on bisq anonymously? Gift cards maybe?

The job board seems kinda dead no? So this is mostly for converting existing wage into crypto? I would personally prefer the control of converting usd into btc myself. 
  
Now freelance to btc without personal info would be interesting

I dont know why people are downvoting you. My only disagreement is that its not specifically "third world countries" imo. 
In modern nations, the *majority* of *most* internet citizens spend *most* of their time within facebook (instagram and whatsapp), amazon and google (browser and search) ecosystems (maybe Im missing one or two other megacorps). 
A very tiny minority spend most of their time on *individual* websites, self-hosted, "alt-net (dark/deep web, tor, zeronet, i2p)."

ah true true, huge blindspot on my part. Also the chevy volt. And Zero motorcycles. 
I just wish it was a bit more widespread by now, 50/50 gas vehicles to electric vehicles to choose from would make me happy. I dont want a chevy, tesla and zero are expensive and not widespread, leading to maintenance problems- expensive and few parts, lack of DIY documentation, few garages specializing in EV.

If someone uses google browser to only access facebook then one is essentially using what could be disparagingly called "facebook browser."
Whats worse is that facebook infects most peoples browser so that it essentially becomes "facebook browser" or at least a browser with a "parasite" or malware attached.

I hear ya but I "splurged" on an almost new car 4 door car, Ill call "comparable" to a model 3. Its msrp is around 26k depending on options. I bought for a bit cheaper because it was the dealership loaner with a few miles on. This was an *expensive* purchase for me, I could have easily gone for a car a few years older with a few more miles. 
To your long-term ownership cost I can see your point. For me ultimately I became interested in electric cars recently just through learning about how that wizardry works. Im now obsessed with the concept. Im a gear-head/petrol-head. I love cars, I love the sound of custom exhaust systems. But they are messy to work on, carburetors are finicky, air/fuel mixture on DI, so many fluid changes, oil, coolant, tranny. So many moving parts in the engine and transmission. I love the "simplicity" of direct drive electric motors (with quotes because the electric engineering, cooling, battery controllers are a bit complicated).
I hope they become more common. In China at least they are.

Looks great. FYI, on mobile (at least for me) i needed to go desktop site to see the search transaction field.

Does anyone trade on Mycellium (wallet) marketplace?
  
If so, how does that compare to Bisq, pros and cons?

wow cool, I never even thought about the idea of running hardware wallets on an emulator.
