You can't be serious. You just can't be. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 15:25:09
You people never learn do you?
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:04:35
What does this have to do with Bitcoin??
Yeah just rage downvote me and don't answer. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:39:34
And tomorrow you're crying how Bitcoin always gets such negative press and you'll just have no clue why. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:52:03
How do you people come up with this nonsense? You just pull it out of your ass or what?
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:30:16
Those of a shitload of Bitcoiners. Please stop acting like this is new to you. 
Absolutely hilarious all these downvotes. As if it isn't true what i said. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:44:14
Because Bitcoiners love to use drugs. Really, that's all there is to it. No need to dig deeper. 
And at the same time they have no clue whatsoever why people associate Bitcoin with drugs.

It also wouldn't happen with eggs. 
Are you gonna post in about all the problems with Bitcoin and how that wouldn't happen with banks? If not, why not?
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:01:56
They will just ignore it. Just like any other evidence of Ross' guilt. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:07:47
We need to buy more so your coins get worth more, right? 
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:45:18
Use. The. Search. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:16:25
Do you always repeat everything you say?
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:01:20
And this of course is somehow related to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:40:38
Oh please do. And let us know how that worked out. When you get released in 6 years. 
Please do.

What the hell does that have to do with anything?
Serious question. 
Edit: still waiting for an answer. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:17:56
Do you have any idea how childish and silly you look?
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:52:24
Did you really not notice the process is already over??
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:37:07
And yet tons of Bitcoiners will put their money in it. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:52:32
There was no entrapment. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:46:00
Right. Because acting like a hypocrite is better. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:11:13
Posts like this make you look desperate and frustrated. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:03:02
No they didn't. Yet he wanted them to occur. Something you will keep defending because no matter what, your druggie hero can't be wrong. 
You people are sick in your head. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:44:58
innocent of what ffs?
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:01:13
Yes. 3 or so of those 6 were innocent roommates. The fact that you don't even know this tells me i don't need to discuss this any further with you. 
Also it's not proven they are corrupt. Innocent till proven guilty, remember?
And when they are proven guilty why would you suddenly believe it's true while in Ross his case you believe it's false? Now the evil government suddenly speaks the truth?
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:27:48
There was no entrapment to have someone murdered. No matter how much you want this to be the case, there just isn't. Even if there was entrapment it was still his choice to do it. 
It scares me how you people do anything to make it look like Ross trying to have 6 people killed was not his fault or not a bad thing. Truly scary.
