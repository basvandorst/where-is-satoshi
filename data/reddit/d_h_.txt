It is a common misconception that it is “impossible for everyone to repay their loan AND interest” but it is not actually true.
I posted an answer to the medium article to explain why:

Thanks for your support! I will post an update on bitcoin.se on Wednesday, after the hearing.

Really hard to say which is more likely. In Sweden there was disagreement between Skatterättsnämnden (government agency that give advance rulings in tax questions) and Skatteverket (the Tax Authority) on how to interpret Article 135(1) in the directive that I posted above. Which is why the case is now in the EU court.

Let's wait and see if we need it for an oral stage. If not, I'll definitely return it all. :)
@_date: 2014-08-22 05:46:32
Seems to be pretty standard for this type of case. But sure, lawyers aren't cheap.

"it's scary that you think that forum comments are valid argument. "
Sorry, I don't get it. What is it that I think? Which forum comments exactly?

Thanks a lot for the donations! Like I mentioned in my latest post on bitcoin.se I'm not really looking to crowdfund the costs but all contributions are of course welcome! I will put them to use.
@_date: 2014-08-22 05:43:01
Not yet, but I agree that it makes a lot of sense. I will try to contact all of them today.

Saying that everybody should secure their own private keys is like saying that everybody should fix their own cars, build their own house, produce their own food etc. It's not possible for everyone to be an expert in everything, it doesn't make sense for the individual and it doesn't make sense economically speaking (see "specialization").
Some amount of trust is necessary to have a thriving society, everyone shouldn't spend their time studying information security. We're better off if they do something they love that they'll become really good at.
That said, with Bitcoin it's not necessary to trust a single entity, you can spread it out (using e.g. multisig).

Thanks a lot!

Hedqvist here. It is correct that the dispute in Sweden between Skatteverket and Skatterättsnämnden was regarding the fees. The person from Skatteverket responsible for the appeal made that very clear in a comment in a [news article]( (in Swedish).
Roughly translated: "Our goal is not to add VAT to bitcoins, but there could possibly be VAT on the exchange fee".
BUT, in the last few days I have heard that there is an opinion among lawyers and other experts that "questions referred to the CJEU are formulated so broadly, that they could be interpreted as also pertaining to the sale of bitcoins as such". I don't have the expertise to have an opinion on that, but if that is true it sure makes the case even more important.

Creating it is easy of course. Not getting hacked and not losing your password is the hard part.
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:23:33
Got it. I'll wait to see what the moderators say though. Hoping that we can bend the rules a bit here. It's not me personally that needs the money really, as you can see from the description. My life will be the same with or without it but it matters for a lot of Bitcoin businesses in Europe.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:55:35
I'm not talking about understanding cryptography on a higher level or using a paper wallet or Multibit or blockchain.info, sure a lot of people could learn that. I'm talking about *really* protecting information (in this case your private key) so that there is *no way* you lose it or get it stolen.
The most expensive things people own are usually insured (cars, houses etc.). You take care of it yourself but *if* something would happen you're life isn't ruined. It will be hard to insure a bitcoin wallet though as it is hard for the insurance company to protect themselves against fraud.
It's not a problem for people to hold smaller amounts of bitcoin but when we're talking about savings people probably want some help and/or protection.

I am not trying to downplay the importance, sorry if that has been the case, I have just been communicating my understanding of the case. See my comment [here]( for some more info.

Here is a link to the Council Directive on the common system of value added tax (VAT):

I wasn't actually arguing anything, I was just pointing out the disconnect between the stated goal/mission and the implementation. If, for example, instead of "price stability" the goal was that price increases should be "predictable" it would be more in line with the implementation.

There is a lot of misunderstanding around this project. They never claimed to be trying to find a "beneficial application of blockchain technology". They are trying to create a digital version of their central bank money that is available to the general public. It won't be decentralized.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:22:51
True. The issuance will be controlled by the central bank but they seem to be interested in it having cash like properties.

I'm not completely sure actually. I did not try that part myself as I didn't have the cable but based it off information on Trezors' site. From what I can find in other threads it seems that it might not work with SegWit? Anyone who has the answer, please let me know and I'll update the article.
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:41:31
Thanks! Yes, this is great news. Please be aware though that this is not the final judgement, though the opinion of the Advocate General carries a lot of weight. There is a top level comment by saevarg that you can upvote to make more people realize this.
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:20:12
It's a completely new read. New talks, from between 2015 and 2017.
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:48:17
Agreed. What I mean is that people in that kind of position really _should_ know this stuff. Obviously he doesn't though.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:04:24
I don't love this analogy as it applies just as well to the regular bank system. You get some "bank money" that you can move around freely and transfer back and forth to your friends at the same bank.
Yes, Lightning Network is a layer on top of Bitcoin but it differs completely from other such layers that we're used to in that there is no third party that you need to trust (like a casino or a bank).

Thanks, I had missed this. I will update the article.
@_date: 2013-01-17 19:35:12
Thanks for the feedback. I will add something like this.

Thanks for the tip!

Thanks for your comments timepad! I will fix the SHA256 stuff like bitaddress.org does and remove Google Analytics.
Regarding JQuery and Bootstrap, there is very little in there that I actually use (it was just a quick way to get a good looking site) so I will try to strip it down to the minimum and leave that un-obfuscated. It might be a few days until I have time to fix it though.
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:10:03
Thanks a lot!

For all Swedes, here is what I wrote about it in Swedish: 
It also includes some quotes from the ruling.

There are some, but yeah, not many. 
@_date: 2013-01-17 11:19:38
No no, it's all client side. I tried to explain that as clearly as I possibly could under "Is this safe?"
@_date: 2013-01-16 22:09:13
I made this page after watching a video where a church in Sweden had installed a terminal from MasterCard to accept donations by credit card. It made me wonder how much they have to pay MasterCard to be able to do this.
So, I decided to make a little showcase of how extremely simple it is to start accepting Bitcoin donations. (Also, of course, it's free.)

The private key is generated client side using javascript. You can download the page and use it offline if you want to, all code is contained in the html page.

Det viktigaste för oss är att vara professionella, trovärdiga och öppna. Vi kommer att presentera precis vilka vi är så att ni kan kolla upp oss noga om ni skulle vilja (mig kan ni redan läsa lite om [här]( I teamet finns kompetens inom juridik, teknik och att driva företag. Vi kommer också att ha en lägre avgift än den Kapiton har nu.
Jag kommer att återkomma med mer detaljer, håll utkik på bitcoin.se bara.
