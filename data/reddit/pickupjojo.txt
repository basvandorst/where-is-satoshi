Assuming you're talking about paper wallets, it's actually pretty easy. There a few quick steps:
* Generate a new address on [bitaddress.org](
* Click on "Paper Wallet" then print one or more.
* Send your funds to the public address of your new wallet.
* That's it.

Very very cool. But only one question: is there any private key somewhere? I mean, as Casascius does with the holograms.
@_date: 2013-05-24 14:16:16
There are many long vanity addresses, and you could get almost anything you want very easily. The only thing is that their private keys are unknown, because they were made only to be valid; not as you would usually do, generating a set of public address with its private key, which is really long.

You're welcome.
@_date: 2013-06-08 15:28:50
Hmm, alright. Thanks for you answer! :)
Anyway, it's still a nice way (at least for me, not intending to hide from illegal activities) to make my wallet look cleaner, getting rid of all those previous micro transactions.

I will not beg or anything, but I can tell I'm rather new to bitcoin since I jumped in few weeks ago when it was worth around $260. Then, I mined about 0.004 BTC in few days, just to learn how it works. I then bought my first BTC from a website where you can use Google Checkout instead of a bank transfert, thus *wasted* $165 for a single BTC. The idea was to use this (probably bad) way while the price was still rising, because I couldn't use Mt.Gox or anything else to buy some, the verification queue being very very long. I didn't want to speculate or make some profit, just to have one bitcoin and start enjoying everything I could do with it.
Today, I lost half of my money with the current price of bitcoin. I actually love everything about this currency, and I do everything I can to promote it to my friends. But I can't buy more because my bank won't let me send money to external accounts…
So, just my 2 cents for newbies: don't buy bitcoins with PayPal or your credit card. You're gonna get scammed or lose money, and it's not a good start with bitcoin.

A backup of a wallet only contains your public addresses and their private keys, not the transactions. Even 'offline', an address will always be able to receive money. But sending from it needs you to be online, and thus one of your addresses too (through a client or a website like Blockchain).

Nice one! Here's my feedback.
* It looks very slow. You should at least add a loader.
* The content on the homepage is aligned on the left. Why?
* Why wouldn't you display the current (realtime) value on the homepage too? It would be very useful.
* On the live, it would be nice if the price would be green when it went up, and red went it just went down.
* Also, remove that text-shadow. It's not very readable. :)
* Tweets. Hmm… You should select them, not display every single tweet about "bitcoin". I can't actually read Japanese nor spanish, for instance.
* Trends, well, I don't really see the point.
On the bright side, annotations on historical charts are very very great! Stats too. Kudos to you, and congrats for you nice work. :)

Dropped you a PM, but I can answer here too if you want. I bought 2 BTC and I am based in France.
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:02:58
Downvote and report the posts, too. It prevents other users from clicking on the links.
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:50:30
You can even create a Blockchain.info account and import a "watch only" address (using the public address you just printed) to know how much it holds. :)
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:35:01
You'd rather add your bitcoin address to receive tips instead of using those boring CoinURL links. :)
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:59:50
Thank you very much, that's my first tip! :)
Do not hesitate if you further questions.

* **Bitcoin awareness**. I experienced two different situations where people said "lol bitcoins" or even trying to convince others it's not real money, while I was just there trying to sell some stuff. Yeah, most of them might just be trolls, but I don't want to argue with them.
* **Supplying**. Face it: buying bitcoins is not easy. It's easier in USA/Canada with cash deposits, but bank transfers, delays, fees, and constant fluctuating value are somehow scary for many people.
* **Security**. I mean, you could lose your wallet, get scammed, or even have to deal with exchanges like Mt.Gox that could close tomorrow. Every time I had to explain bitcoin to friends, I also had to tell them about how important it is to secure their (online or offline) wallet, or not trust anyone when not using an escrow system, etc. Of course it could happen with fiat too, even daily. But having to be well aware of all those risks could be refraining. My dad lose his e-mail password about twice a year; what would it be with a two-step authentication?

Here you go: [Getting Started](
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:52:13
You can actually withdraw your Mt.Gox BTC wallet to any bitcoin address. Just go to "Funding Options", then "Withdraw Funds" and select "Bitcoins".
@_date: 2013-06-08 22:48:04
It depends on the size of the transaction, which is calculated with the number of inputs and the number of outputs and some other parameters. So it's not *fee* times *how many satoshis* you received, but more like a somehow complex calculation based on the total bytes required for your transaction.
You should give another look at  everything is really well explained, even if I understand you may have some difficulties to get it right at the first read. But, to be honest, you shouldn't hope to do something with your dust. It's discouraged in the Bitcoin algorithm for a good reason: the 'cost' of transactions of very small amounts is not worth it for miners. :)
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:54:23
It's actually very difficult to buy bitcoins in France. Localbitcoins is cool but there's not that many active people. Other sites like Mt.Gox require to do a bank transfert (SEPA), but you can't always do it without going to the bank and paying high fees. So I did what looked the best: used a website called btcQuick selling BTC for Google Checkout, thus directly with your credit card, but for a higher price and with (ironically) a slow delivery. It's pretty cool when the value is low, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend using it, unless that's your only solution.
Any more questions? :)
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:16:39
Glad you understand better now. :)
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:30:16
Unless bitcoin hits $10,000 per BTC, all your dust won't help you buy anything, so that's not a bad or a good news. Well, not exactly since you could spend those satoshis to gambling for instance, but that would still be very low values, and fees wouldn't be avoided either.
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:12:53
First of all, read this: [Getting Started](
Then, Bitcoin won't help you earn anything if you can't invest a little (e.i. in ASICMiner shares). You can obviously get some free money with faucets, but unless you want to waste your time solving captchas all day long for $0.01, it's not worth it. Every other way like gambling is a trap if you're not willing to lose money.
You're broke? Try selling your talents and skills on or sell things on (or BitMit.net). It's one of the best way to get some BTC doing something useful.

I'm actually trying to sell mine for BTC. I'll tell you. :D
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:15:22
Blockchain or Coinbase are some good choices I think. Easy and quick setup, no download required, and your customers can use their BTC in few minutes. Maybe you could write a small tutorial to help them get started?
Discounts are great too! Purchases with bitcoins are nice if you accept the idea to get more or less USD while BTC is fluctuating. I mean, you spread awareness of Bitcoin through your store giving away few mBTC (I guess), so you might as well be pretty confident about how your clients perceive your gift. If you really believe in Bitcoin, you won't really mind fluctuations. :)
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:08:19
0.00000001 BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-08 15:20:03
Do you actually need to be verified to fund your Mt.Gox account with bitcoins? I don't remember well since I got verified before trading on Mt.Gox, but yes, that would be the weak part.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:57:58
Oh, I see. Sorry for my misunderstanding.
@_date: 2013-06-08 22:55:15
Redeeming comment karma is actually a lot better than any other faucet would give you nowadays. It's not that much, but it doesn't require any captcha solving, there are no ads, and it doesn't create dust.
If faucets are made for people to start using bitcoins, then might already be the best one I know with this feature. There is no contributing like other faucets, true, but if you want to help people enjoy their first bitcoins, then you could already tip them yourself. :)
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:32:36
Micro transactions would make you have to pay *high* fees if you wanted to buy something with your wallet. Even if you reach 1 BTC in any way, the inputs would be so important that the transaction would be big (I mean, in bytes) thus requiring you to add fees.
If you want to buy things with bitcoins, you should buy bitcoins before, on exchanges for example. Faucets will only make you have dozens or hundreds of inputs that are not really usable, unless you pay fees — but I guess you wouldn't like to *waste* 0.0005 BTC if you want to spend small amounts like 0.01. :)
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:41:45
It's just a guy burning a 9 mBTC worth wallet he put on a SD card before. Probably a way to relate to people burning real money bills.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:23:05
Remember first faucets? They would easily give like 0.1 BTC. :)
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:25:54
There's no client on Blockchain, because Blockchain is actually an online client (well, a wallet to be more precise). You can register an account and withdraw your 0.3 BTC to your Blockchain bitcoin address from Mt.Gox, or leave it on your Mt.Gox account if you plan to trade it soon for money. There's no major security issue with doing that, just be careful of what you're doing exactly.
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:52:16
And if you bought back yesterday, you would have made even more.
Welcome to bitcoin trading!

Bet up to 0.2 BTC to recover my previous loss, finally won 1.957x my bet. Will never do that again, because you will probably lose more than you win, even more with martingale strategies.
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:53:17
Did you look at the transactions of the address which sends you the 0.25 BTC? If there are many other similar payouts, it could be a faucet.
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:44:10
The main exchange is Mt.Gox. There are sellers, and buyers. When bids and asks are equals, a trade is made, thus setting the 'current' (well, latest) price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-24 14:23:39
Yes, mostly. But some are still somehow *in use*.
