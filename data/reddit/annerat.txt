Believe for tax reasons (last time it was posted, someone posted a link to a Dutch sandwich:  )

The Ƀ symbol is understood too, and no one here blinks an eye when it's displayed in normal context, without this anti-circlejerk that regular occurs here against Ƀ.
For example, a recently top post about the highest valued property currently purchasable with bitcoin ( and guess what, that listing used  Ƀ &amp; there was no outcry!

Thanks! I prefer the Ƀ symbol. All the discontent about unified branding is moot, while public perception is currently being harmed mostly by the repeated news of money being stolen and what not!

Community rules... No referral links in submissions! (assuming 'lucky=1403' is the referral code that benefits OP in some-way)

much power!

Jeez, not everyone checks Reddit.  Coindesk publish many articles about Bitcoin, and also tweet them, making it easy to follow breaking news.

The design is nice. Please could you share the vector source, if there's one?
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:55:35
Damn, that stops me from being able to use it :|
@_date: 2014-12-20 08:00:24
Source? Most I've seen are for pennies

Probably already a higher number of women interact with bitcoin than everyone realises.

Hopefully the bits of info people have already shared has helped, though not sure why you felt the need to highlight your gender in the title.

What process are you following to acquire a vanity address? as this is something I'm interested in, however, I'm fairly new to bitcoin (I do not even have a wallet yet)
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:02:29
Thank you! After using Vanitygen, is the next step just to enter the newly created address information into a wallet app? I'm thinking of using blockchain.info

Fantastic! Great to hear you’ll be releasing your forked version of ownCloud. I would like to watch the repository, do you have one?

During the initial pledge drive in 2012, I backed Star Citizen, however, so far I've not posted in the forum, because it always seems to have a lot of discontent.
I just want to head out into deep space and trade.  Do you think a bitcoin guild would work? [&amp; [@_date: 2013-08-03 17:42:50
For clarity, I think AML = Anti-Money Laundering (I was confused over the acronym, so looked it up).

Another one was when planning applications/objections kept going missing, and it turned out that the filter was blocking any with the word erection in them &gt;
