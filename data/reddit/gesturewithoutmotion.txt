As a Torontonian, SUHWEEEEET! I signed up for the site way back on the 12th of April and was unsure about how legitimate it would be. But judging by the level of interaction here, my doubts are no more :) Best of luck with the launch, looking forward to transferring my colourful plastic bills!
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:09:00
Here's the original image they used as a blurred out asic chip:
The odd thing is, it's labelled as an ASIC chip in the original image file as well... 
It definitely looks sketch, as the communication dates have been modified to look as if they were posted from way back in december. On their Facebook page, they have an image gallery from February, though it says they joined Facebook only a few days ago. 
Why take these obvious steps to make it look like they've been here longer than they actually have been?
Having said that... is it worth the risk of NOT placing an order? By what they're saying, if they get their 100 orders this week, they'll ship by next month at the latest. That would probably beat the glut of ASICS that BFL has in queue to ship..
Or is that what they want to lure us with... ugh..

True. I ended up buying bitcoins at $123 a piece last week because it just refused to budge any lower, when Mt.Gox was dealing around $100. I'm Canadian so it's pretty much my only option if i want to do e-transfers instead of $30 wire transfers.

Hey buddy, I just bought some through Vault of Satoshi yesterday, a new Toronto-based exchange:

There's ASX Project: 
Pretty much everyone has dismissed them as a scam due to irregularities in their post times, domain registration times, copypasta responses to email inquiries by other users, almost-too-good-to-be-true pricing and shipping timeframe, inactive social media presence and some questions about their picture sources to name a few. You can search this subreddit for more indepth analysis.
Having said that, I still went ahead and placed an order with them and have been tracking their orders and progression several times a day. The site activity actually seems to check out so far, though the past couple of days have said "Out of Stock" when their latest update points to 6 modules remaining. Hopefully I'll find out one way or another soon; I will report back to the community at that time :)

Try  , I bought from there a few days ago and the entire process was done in a day. You have to set up the account and get it verified before you can start trading though, which requires sending them a copy of a photo ID and proof of address (phone bill, for example). You can upload the scanned copies directly on their website and be verified within the hour. Then you'll have to go to a BMO bank to deposit your CAD into their account, which will also require you to exchange it to USD before you are able to deposit, which has a $1.50 fee attached to it just so you're aware. Remember to send them an email to let them know you've made a deposit, and it should appear in your account. 
Good luck!

@_date: 2013-11-08 21:15:47
That's not the point. The point is that society today does not rely on Bitcoin. Therefore, it isn't too big to fail yet. One day, it (or some other cryptocurrency) may be big enough to be integrated in our daily lives the way dollars are, and that's what will make it too big to fail. But that isn't the case today, so no, it isn't too big to fail yet.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:43:20
I think it's because you're not including the fee amount. The fee will come out of your funds, so your fee + sell order can't equal more than 1 BTC.
Just a thought. Try it and see?

@_date: 2013-11-12 15:08:47
At the moment, I would say most people using Bitcoin are fully aware of the exchanges. Also, the traders are already aware that it makes no difference what you call it and would most likely still think in terms of BTC at least for now. So I don't think it would affect them that much. 
There was a comment I read a day or two ago about the need for Satoshis to be viewed as pennies (i.e. the smallest denomination of the currency), meaning we should be comparing 1 USD to 100 satoshis, no?

Lack of 'proof' doesn't mean it's a scam. You can call them a scam once they fail to deliver.

The criticism isn't that there aren't choices for people who want to spend their bitcoin. It's that people don't WANT to spend their bitcoin. And why would they want to part with something that's expected to rise in value so significantly so soon? We all saw the "bitcoin millionaires" from a few months ago. We think that even if we can get 10k, 20k, 40k we'd be able to pay off our debts. My feeling is that a very large portion of people holding bitcoins right now are not in the greatest of financial situations, and those situations are still very real.
People in general won't be compelled to use bitcoins as long as we purchase them with fiat. The change will come once companies start offering bitcoins as salary. Simple as that. And yes I know there are some people hiring freelancers for bitcoins, but there aren't enough yet.

I do know, but OP posed the question about Bitcoin. And how big it has to be for its failure to be so incomprehensible that the government steps in to keep it afloat. The point is, if we all woke up tomorrow to find that Bitcoin was corrupted/hacked/whatever, it wouldn't devastate the economy. 
Having gone through the posts here, I think you/bitswanitz and I understood the phrase "too big to fail" differently, but both are correct in their own understanding. It's the idea vs. the usage. I agree that the idea of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are too big to fail already, and this definitely does seem to be the currency format of the future. but at the moment we don't rely on it to keep our society running, so by that definition it's not too big to fail yet.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:14:10
Oh, and it was sent out at 6:17PM EST, April 30, 2013. I registered out of curiosity last week and went through the online order process, stopping short of transferring my bitcoins. This is pretty much all I know. I don't have any affiliation with the company, but I do want to ask those of you who can afford to lose the minimum $650 on their smallest machine order to take a chance. They started with 250 in stock and are currently sitting at 219. They say they'll ship within 3 weeks of reaching 100 orders, which means they're 69 orders away. We should know in a relatively short time whether or not they're for real or not.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:46:09
Interesting. Thanks for the info :) I received my BFL shipping confirmation today as well, so it's good to know there are alternative uses for the machine.

Welp, the buying rate is a bit higher on LibertyBit. I just bought a small amount at $125 because it just refused to go lower (of course, dropped to $119 CAD right after).  I want to get my money on the Mt.GOX market and as a Canadian who doesn't want to go through the wiretransfer route, this seems to be the only way to go about it. Buy on LibertyBit and transfer BTC to wallet, then transfer wallet BTC to Mt.Gox .
Any Canadians have a better idea/method?

Yeah, I paid around $1,200 for my BFL pre-order a few weeks ago, which is supposed to do 25 GHash/s. They're offering a machine that does the same speed at almost half the price. Having said that, I believe the BFL machines all doubled in price recently, so originally would've been about the same price that this new company is offering.. And this new company is also saying that pricing for the machines after the initial batch of 250 units will be re-evaluated. 
hmmmm....what to do...
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:31:03
I wonder if we'll see a spike on the 15th due to paycheques being issued...
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:00:53
OK, here's a good one:
I placed a buy order for 1BTC and it went through, showing up in the 'Closed Orders' box. I then clicked the Order Book link in the side menu. Then I clicked the back button, and the browser (Firefox 20.0.1) gave me a 'document expired' page, with the option to 'try again'. Confirmation popup asks me to resend info, which I click, and I end up back to the ordering page. THEN, MY ORDER GETS RESUBMITTED! It automatically makes a trade. While not a 'hack', it's still something that should be fixed before launch :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:53:23
At this point, the best thing to do with that $100-150 is to exchange it for BTC and hang on to it for the time being. Don't worry about trading, don't worry about spending, just hold for now. Don't worry about the momentary ups and downs. Big picture!

I disagree:
- They will turn a profit within the next 7 years. might not be a lot and will probably still take a while, but a profit nonetheless.
- It's fairly easy to mine, just plug the machine in, run some software and follow some simple instructions to join a pool.
- Jalapeno's are fairly inexpensive.
- For a 'broke ass college student', I'd advise to stay out of the bitcoin game until you actually have money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:42:38

Hey there! I actually heard about this from your thread, and left some comments there as well :)
There are actually some very realistic and probable explanations for some of the points brought up as evidence of a scam in that thread. One user mentioned it was a scam because the posts on the site predate the registry of the domain. This can be explained pretty easily. Looks like they were operating from a different domain originally as they have 'countdown' posts for the launch of their site. All of the posts could've been imported into their new site fairly easily since it's built on Wordpress. Why else would you have countdown posts on a site..for the same site the posts are posted on?
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:44:35
Haven't heard of them, but I lost $1600 gambling on an unheard-of company a few months ago (asxproject.com) so I'm probably going to sit this one out. Then again, I've also gambled the same amount on a heard-of company (bfl) and the result hasn't been drastically different :P

Canadian here, TD customer. I sent an E-Transfer to LibertyBit and purchased coins on their exchange. This took $2 and I think two days. Then I transferred my coins to my wallet, and sent my wallet coins to MtGox.

I'm curious about what his admission means. $5 - 15m is a lot of money for us, but to him? It's chump change. Less percentage than what many of us here are putting in of our net worth. Is it really that big of a deal? I know he comes with some star power, so I guess there's that..
And I don't think he meant any wordplay by it. If price quadruples, do you think he'd sell 5m to get back down to a 15m holding? I take his words as aiming to put 15m of his money towards acquiring bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:38:41
They're doing business through BMO btw. Being a TD customer, I just took some cash to my local BMO branch and deposited it into their account, and shortly afterwards my account on Vault of Satoshi was credited and I was able to buy Bitcoin on their site. You'll need to get your account authorized though, which requires sending them a bank-accepted photo ID (Drivers license, passport, etc) and some mail issued within the last 180 days to verify your home address (phone bill, etc), and voila. I was able to do all that within a day, so the process is pretty quick. Best of luck!

Absolutely, but be sure to understand what you're getting into before you go and put money into Bitcoin. The golden rule is to **ONLY PUT MONEY IN THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE!** Understand what your own motivations are, whether it's to support the system or to make a few dollars. Understand the trends and follow the news coverage surrounding it, ie, start researching and keeping tabs on ongoing development. All the best!
