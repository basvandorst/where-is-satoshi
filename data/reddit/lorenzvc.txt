it's not that hard for me since I haven't spent a single euro. but thanks for clarifying. It would still need a lot of research before I would decide it's a worthy investment. and I'm sure there are better ways to invest my money. thank you :)

thank you very much. So you are telling me BTC are still a climbing value, and it would be good to invest in it? so let's say, if I bought 500€ worth of bitcoins, it wouldn't be a risky investment?

thank you for the clear reply.
I get the feeling that the rush is already over and it's a bit late to start now. I have a gaming laptop, with decent graphic specs. but that would probably eat more electricity than it would get me bitcoins. also, i'm guessing a night long running laptop is not very profitable. I live in Belgium, so I'm not sure if the electricity cost will be worth the effort.
I'm guessing i'll need a few days, if not weeks, to read up on current cryptocurrency techniques, and guess it's not really worth my time , for now.
I'm a part-time working student and was wondering if my laptop or small extra cost hardware (500-1000€) could eventually get me something extra.

not sure if i'm at the right place, but since I saw this post, I decided to reply.
I'm a very active computer-user. at this time, would it be profitable for me to set up something to mine bitcoins? I also have no clue of what the cost might be, or profit, but I just noticed that this subreddit was still active. is it something that I should concider? using money to invest in a mining-rig? can I use my current laptop to mine and profit somehow? can bitcoin be easily transferred to cash, or should it be invested into more btc-rigs?

thanks for the reply, but I barely even know how cryptocurrencies work, and how the mining would be done. is it just simply installing programs on your computer, click a button, and add the "ethereum" to your wallet?.. I'm a complete newb, so excuse me for not completely understanding this yet
