It actually works with Trezor and your own Bitcoin node
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:35:40
What exactly do you mean?
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:51:20
Yes. We never stopped offering that.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:47:17
Sorry :-) Won't happen again, but somehow we couldn't believe what we read in this bill
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:40:52
could you please contact us via Email? info
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:45:52
Not yet, but we are about to introduce many new features. Every week a new one for the next months. Just wait a few weeks I think you will be really happy.
@_date: 2016-08-22 08:14:16
Thanks man! We appreciate your kind words.
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:02:58
The way the wallet is designed, you get the keys when creating a wallet with the backup sheet. If you ever lose access to your wallet, you do 100% rely on the backup sheet.
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:55:48
Yes. When creating a new wallet, you will get a backup sheet with your passwort encrypted private keys. Bitwala has at no point knowledge of that password, and we also don't keep the backup file.
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:58:01
Working on it. :D
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:02:02
Could you specify your problem or shoot us an email support We'll look into it.
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:20:40
at the moment only computer, but we will launch the mobile app really soon.
@_date: 2016-08-22 08:15:01
For now, it works for Latinamerican bank accounts if they are denominated in USD. We will add support for local currencies as well, just give us a little time. :D
@_date: 2016-04-26 10:00:32
Which other things do you mean? Sidechains? What else?
@_date: 2016-04-12 15:19:51
Thank you! Please let us know if we could add features that you would like to see or if you see things to improve! We always try to work close with you guys. So we appreciate any feed back.
@_date: 2016-04-04 13:07:26
ask PayPal :-) We are in the process of getting it back online. We hope to get it up again soon
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:36:58
We will refund all costumers, including you. Please don't call us scammer, we try our very best for you and every each of our customers. This is even offensive to my team who are working really hard to reimburse everyone and keep all of you updated.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:45:30
@_date: 2016-04-08 11:38:14
use all4btc.com instead. We never have any issues like this
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:50:11
You are welcome :-)
@_date: 2016-04-12 15:20:40
take it :-) We are glad if we can offer addtitional opportunities to you
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:49:45
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:12:33
You're totally right, but would a good investor sell all his stack just because of some bad news? No. The other point mentioned is trading. Traders are perfect for the market because the balance the exchanges out they do basically run this whole thing. I only argue about panic selling. Nothing more
@_date: 2016-04-19 10:47:13
bitwa.la is one of the cheapest provider
@_date: 2016-04-04 12:15:21
ONE OF EUROPE'S biggest BITCOIN seed rounds 
@_date: 2016-04-12 11:14:43
Yeah! Transfer as much you want. It's nice to finally be able to give something back to you guys. Thanks for supporting during our journey! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:41:19
Have you ever been to the Room77 meet up? I partly agree with you in terms of the forums but tbh when I attended meetups in Prague or Berlin money was a topic for sure, but most of it was pure enthusiasm about Bitcoin its potential and the tech behind it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:45:13
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:05:18
yeah, but try to get this with something like Bitcoin :-) It is impossible to name a company in Germany anything with bitcoin inside and you tell me I get "Förderungen" :-) One year ago they would have told me to shut down the business right away since the legal situation was still not clear
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:01:24
You know, we have these competitions ins Berlin, too. You are totally right, it is good that they do it. At least they try something. But in my opinion screw those competitions, if you are trying to build a company it is already a competition. It is probably the hardest you will ever face, because it is not a fake one, it is a real one, the market. If you win in this competition- the price is that you have a successful company and that is the best price you could possibly have. Why is it necessary to start a fake competition? Why not motivate the people to start a business? Give them money and make it easy to do so? Why not get VCs to Germany to invest in those companies instead of creating competitions like in school or university. I think it is time to think different about Startups in Germany. It is not a competition or a hobby, it is essential because you want to create something to make a living of. Give small companies a real chance and you'll get the paycheck after. Don't make them join a competition
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:08:01
Thank you :-) My opinion too. How can you compete with companies if you pay so much more for legal and tax stuff? I am not even talking about real tax, we always wanted to pay tax here and we still have to. It is just the huge amount of money that you have to pay for lawyers, consulting and legal aspect which makes it impossible to compete on an international level
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:17:46
Thanks, Naaxiom. Any new order from now until the magic $1000 date will count as an entry into the competition.
We allow anonymous ordering, so a 'raffle ticket' is generated per order rather than per customer.
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:15:36
I'm sorry to hear about your poor experience with all4btc, and I want to help get you your money back. We are constantly improving our customer support and trying to give our customers a better experience. If you look at our site, you can tell we've made a lot of improvements, especially in the area of order confirmations.
About 3-4 months ago was during the last price increase of Bitcoin, and we were honestly overwhelmed with orders, and still managed to process 95% of incoming orders. We can give refunds, and will gladly refund the difference of your order. Please contact us however you'd like and we will take care of this situation once and for all. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:23:18


But it does. And you're right, only by because of acts of power by powerful people. Governments have the power to define by their own law. There's a law here in Germany that defines Beer, and if your beer does not sufficiently fit their definition, you cannot call it "Beer". It doesn't mean that a Bud Light isn't necessarily beer, but it sure has an influence in the locales which are governed by these state powers.
Fiat lives up to the properties of money because people believe it to live up to those properties, regardless whether it's by will or force.
While we all here understand that Bitcoin is money, it is not until other people linguistically "accept" Bitcoin as money -- or a member of the "money" category -- that it will be functionally money. And also vice versa, as soon as people start using Bitcoin as money, people will naturally start calling it as such.
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:09:39
Yes, all of the Amazon.(EU) and ebay.(EU) sites are supported, and are in fact very popular with our users. Zolando is also supported, but we kindly ask that you keep the returns to a minimum, as some people have been abusing the return system with such sites.
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:06:05
:-D Just try it with a fake email. You'll see :-)
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:37:29
Yes, maybe the "Bitcoin Kiez" is a little overhyped, since there are only about 8 shops that accept Bitcoin there.
But overall Bitcoin is accepted at over 50 locations, there is a strong development group and a handful of startups. Bitcoin.de has offices in Berlin, The creator of the Android Bitcoin Wallet is from Berlin, and there are regular meetups that have 50+ attendees.
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:12:10
9flats, a similar service, already accepts bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:09:45
Yes, we know and we are sorry for all the costumers from that time period. We had this massive demand increase in November/ December, our sales skyrocked and we had close to 100 emails every day to answer. To be honest we weren't prepared for that success back then and this is why it took so long for us to respond during that time. Since then everything changed. We hired more people for support, we have more English natives in our support team and totally changed our CRM so that something like this can't happen in the future. We can only apologize for that and promise that we learned our lesson and it won't happen again
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:57:38
Yes! Germany lives in another century when it comes to payment technologies. This is why the young people are bagging for alternatives and people like Jörg Platzer from Room 77 felt that from the very beginning of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:01:15
could you tell us which credit card you use? We would be happy to give that cash back to our customers. Thank you for your help and your honest opinion!
@_date: 2014-03-18 08:17:36
Hi for Europe we offer with all4btc.com to buy anything on big retailers e.g. Amazon or Ebay.
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:16:05
If that's true then either
* We'll be out of business
* Samsung will dramatically upped their release schedule
Let's hope for the latter..
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:54:30
If you're really interested in loans check out bitbond or another peer-to-peer lending platform. If you're really interested in investing, well, that can be done with any asset, not only via banks.
As far as, "bitcoin doesn't do this" ... well, money doesn't do everything. People do things, and it's only a matter of time before a better money such as Bitcoin finds individuals with those financial service skills to join in on the ecosystem.
It's kinda like saying, "4chan is great for trolling, reddit isn't necessary"
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:52:25
We are sorry you had a bad experience with All4btc.
We aim to process all orders within one working day. You can always contact us directly on +49 (0) 30 269 489 30 (10-6 EST) or by email: info
We always try to offer the highest level of support to our customers and and are currently expanding our support team to make sure that every customer's experience is a [happy one](
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:34:55
Yes,  there are in fact many of those events over here. I wouldn't say 3 a week but quite a lot. Today there is the Bitcoin Startups Berlin Meetup  in Betahouse for example. Please stop by if you have the time
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:48:18
50 Locations according to Coinmap.org
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:06:31
Thanks :-)
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:44:43
No, just try it out - 
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:10:08
Yes of course, but not everybody can easily acquire credit cards, or don't like the long waiting times of bank transfers. That's why we offer another option for people who prefer to use Bitcoin without waiting for popular sites like Amazon to begin accepting them. Plus, there's no registration required at any site.
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:02:26
yes, you can order with the other ones too.. We already serve customers from all over the world
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:05:39
 (electronics)
 (everything)
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:48:47
:-) thank you very much. We wanted to use that Visa Card before and it turns out that DKB is really restricted regarding the companies that they offer a bank account to. Unfortunately we got rejected :-( But we will look for others! Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:57:06
can you move your money without your bank's permission? is it even "your" money if you cannot?
financial services such as investments and loans are useful for those that need them, while storing money is essential for individuals with more money than can fit in their pockets. The article focuses on the storage and movement of money.
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:11:08
This may be easy for some people in some countries, but in places such as Germany, it is very hard and expensive to get credit cards, and often inconvenient because most places do not accept them anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:37:13
:-) It's gonna be two when the price hits 2000 :-)
@_date: 2014-03-19 12:43:03
Hello Bitcoiners,
This is Philip from All4Btc, a service that lets you buy anything using Bitcoin (besides subscriptions and darknet sites). To help show off our updated site with better customer support integration, we're discounting our fees for two weeks. Last week we [announced over 1 million Euro in sales]( thanks to the Bitcoin community.
While you wait for your favorite retailers to wake up and start accepting Bitcoin, we are there to provide the best service with fast fulfillment and customer service.
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:13:06
Thank you.. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:59:12
We are very sorry for what happend to you back then. We were a little Startup and we were overwhelmed by the mass of orders we got. We learned our lesson, improved our costumer support and hired more people to handle all orders on time. something like that won't happen in the future. We hope that you'll give us the chance to proof that. Regardless of that, we are sorry that you had this experience using our service.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:01:25
Our dataset is not so small, we have over 1000 regular customers, but just to be clear: we only saw this correlation and found it interesting. We did not proof anything, we only said that we might should rethink the way we look at deflationairy money systems.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:15:44
Yes, make sure to get / print your receipt, usually donations in Germany are tax deductible ;)
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:15:19
fuck off. The sepa zone has hundrets of banks. I would prefer them in eastern europe, they are more relaxed....
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:56:45
:-D It was just a guess :-)
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:19:29
I don't know maybe you are right. I will talk to our lawyer, if you are right we will take it offline right away
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:58:46
and then spend it on  :-)
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:22:43
You should go there and drink some shots instead of watching shots of it :-D
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:17:49
Yes, a whole shitload for bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:47:48
We love the Room 77. Bitcoin or not it is one of the coolest bars in Berlin and the Burgers are awesome! Every bitcoin enthusiast in the world should at least stop by ones in his life. For us in Germany it's already like the Bitcoin Mecca:-)
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:50:47
unfortunately not yet, we are working on that. We'll keep you updated on that and we hope to realize that soon
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:14:47
You just ruined my weekend.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:57:11
Thank you :-)! we are trying our very best!
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:22:12
Thank you! We thought it's the perfect name for it :-)
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:21:23
What email service to you use? I will forward this directly to our development team.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:11:48
Thank you.. We are working on getting the fees down..
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:58:09
can you send us a mail from your email address to support and include that you contacted us via reddit? We will try verify your account right away
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:17:18
Our information policy goes align with dutch law. We are not forced to provide more details of our company. If you are interested about us or who is behind the webside. Please visit our webpage: bitcoinsberlin.com
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:21:31
Hey, sorry we are not a user, we are the creator of the page. Our company realized projects like   and  - We have more than 1000 regular costumers all over the world. Just ask around there should be a few people out there who used one of our services already.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:59:07
thank you. We will try to get new partners for Bitcoin supermarket. Don't hesitate to give more feedback. We really appreciate every single one.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:46:40
Thanks for the good advice! We will do that in the near future. We introduced other languages on bitcoinsupermarket.eu, but the feedback was that most people who use bitcoin are really good in English. Only 2% of our costumer took the chance to look at the page in their native language
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:22:20
okay, you are right. we will publish more information about our company. We wanted to keep it as clean as possible but you brought up a reasonable fact. If we ask for information, we have to provide them too. I'll tell our developers to make the information appear asap
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:45:43
We are working on this. We will lower the fees soon (and announce it here too)
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:20:30
Our shipping fees are different. It depends on the size and the weight of the package but also about where you live. Our packages are shipped from Spain to all over Europe. Generally if there is no button add to cart the product is probably not in stock at the moment.
About the verification. For up to 200€ a month it is sufficient to provide us your name and an email address. For higher amount we ask for a copy of an ID card and a utility bill 
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:06:23
We have to stick to European money laundering rules, since we are a legal registered company in the Netherlands. We would love to provide this service without taking any information about our costumer but we have to respect Europe's "Know your costumer rules" otherwise we won't be around for long. At the moment we are implementing a outsourced web-ID- solution, so that our costumers don't have to trust us with their personal documents anymore.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:17:52
Sorry but we bought this theme from a designer. We liked it and it is just the modern way of creating a website. We did not copy coinbase in any why neither are we competitors to coinbase. We use similar designs for years now and we won't stop using those just because other companies use similar ones.
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:16:23

@_date: 2016-03-11 13:39:21
Sorry that was a translation mistake. 2 million in transaction volume
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:34:22
nice we will! Thank you very much for sharing this information!
@_date: 2016-03-11 13:53:04
true, but we really like it and is still cheaper than the iphone
@_date: 2016-03-16 15:22:22
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:49:33
I respect your concern but I can promise you that we are not taking anybody's ideas away. We are doing the complete opposite by working together with other companies to help spread ideas and products around bitcoin. Actually we work with Bitrefill on this
@_date: 2016-03-16 12:50:47
Thank you! :-) we are glad that you liked it!
@_date: 2015-05-28 14:13:03
if you take a closer look it is exactly what the affiliate program is made for. You create sales that would never be possible without this program. Amazon is not accepting Bitcoin yet so Bitcoin sales are only brought by other pages to amazon, which is somehow affiliate. Am I wrong? 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:30:48
Could you tell us which one it is? We would be really curious. info
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:17:43
It's still fast - near instant. It's still cheap - a couple cents to send money around the globe. And with SegWit and 2nd layer solutions like the Lightning network, it will be even faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2015-05-28 14:23:58
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:58:26
This is only one of many good products that we offer. A "One-Stop-Shop" with integrated Wallet, Visa card (so you can pay at any POS even if merchants don't except bitcoin yet) and pay invoices in 21 currencies and in over 120 countries. This is one of many new products and services that we are going to implement in the coming months.    
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:46:59
It's for both, you can pay with Bitcoin everywhere even Bitcoin is not accepted there and you can pay suppliers abroad
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:26:06
We did already. You can send e-money to many countries in Africa already. Just sign up and verify and mobile money will pop up as an option
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:40:58
We will very soon! Even though the name is not specifically Indian. It's meaning comes from the word havala or hawala.
@_date: 2016-01-28 12:47:41
not if you are located outside the sepa zone and you want to send money to Europe :-)
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:05:54
Hi Fabrizio, please contact Support to resolve your issue. We know their business and they do their Refunds asap.

Bitwala is cheaper and faster to Mexico :-).0.5% and minutes to deposit to your bank account
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:51:57
Haha I agree :-)
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:51:41
I wouldn't call that crash :-) It's down 10 Dollars and is recovering!
@_date: 2016-11-19 12:08:38
Yes, you do. You will have 2 out of 3 keys and the password. Don't loose them, we can't restore them.
@_date: 2016-11-19 12:07:59
We do feature UK bank transfer however it is currently not instant. Limits depend on your account level, anything is possible. Bitwala already bought cars and flats using bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-18 11:43:01
Thank you very much :) We are working around the clock to keep improving our service.
@_date: 2016-12-06 17:00:51
What exactly doesn't work? Appreciate your feedback.
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:56:21
Have you tried: 
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:06:17
Thanks for your feedback, we will work on this!
@_date: 2016-11-19 12:09:22
You can also store bitcoin using our multi-sig wallet and convert them later for paying a bill, making a bank transfer or loading your VISA debit card.

Yeah, we used typeform for the quiz and can't display it differently. Not an ideal choice. But since the quiz is mostly educational, it doesn't really matter. 2nd edition will fix this problem. :D
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:21:34
That's question number 11. That question is about a *massive* increase in network capacity. That's nothing a blocksize increase can achieve. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:05:04
That's interesting. So which one do you say would have been the very first transaction?
@_date: 2016-11-19 12:06:41
Hey, you downloaded the beta app, make sure to update it. We announced the beta version just across early adopters and VIP users like you ;)

@_date: 2015-07-16 21:40:29
Bitwa.la :-)
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:23:36
we send only Euro. The customer pays in Bitcoin, the recipient gets Euro
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:54:52
unfortunately yes :-(
@_date: 2015-07-02 12:56:54
do you receive Euro too on there?
@_date: 2015-07-01 14:37:07
I would say London. Many of the mayor players are a British limited
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:45:26
Thx :-)
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:39:47
We seriously help and explain people how to get Bitcoins in Greece every day since a few weeks. Many of them have never heard of Bitcoin, but they don't have another opportunity. We tell them about local Bitcoins and the ATM in Athens. I really think it is not only PR, Bitcoin can make a change here.
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:26:02
1. Recipient does not have to sign up to bitwala
2. We are currently working on this. We will step by step add more currencies.
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:00:27
Sorry :-) Will do next time
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:12:50
I think the Netherlands are fine, but still the big companies that recently came to Europe chose London because of the FinTech industry and the good network to banks and money
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:59:50
You can send money to anyone, but we will only withdraw the Euro amount. We can't guarantee any exchange rate that the banks take to convert it into national currencies at the moment

Thank you!

Time and usability. Having the Bitwala card means almost realtime transfers to your debit card. In Addition it is so easy to use it. It makes your bank account obsolete 
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:41:20
haha that was supposed to be funny. we will replace this placeholder soon :-) Sorry for that we found it in our free database and thought it's funny^^
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:24:01
Nice! Maybe we can work together. Exchange Bitcoin workers between the offices maybe?
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:52:43
You are right, but there is definitely more guys than girl ins Bitcoin space. We should change that 
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:01:15
It's because only Bitcoin company work there now and our focus is on Bitcoin companies
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:19:46
Bitsandcoins Consulting
Bundesverband Bitcoin
 (Jörg Platzer)
and hopefully soon many more
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:42:44
sure! Any time!
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:36:23
we got 100 mbit/s so far and ready to deploy 400 within one day. and yes, there is a few conferences rooms and we will set up a few phone booths :)
@_date: 2016-02-04 10:17:34
We take a utility bill and a copy of the passport for the Debit card
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:43:14
Please come by and have a look. We would love other enthusiasts to join us!
@_date: 2016-09-09 05:48:43


[Our website]( is up. Sorry if you experienced a temporary downtime.


The requirements depend on your transaction volume, [see here]( 200 Euro can be done without signup at all, 500 Euro with name and email only.


That's highly unlikely, we've never had this case. Our outgoing transactions aren't mentioning Bitcoin, and they aren't connected to an exchange or anything that would be considered "suspicious".
Hope you'll try us anyways!
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:57:05
No, we are still accepting them. But we won't put any more resources towards integration or marketing.
@_date: 2016-09-26 08:36:45
move to Berlin if you want to move to a better office :-)
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:20:16
?!? No you can try right now. Why do you think we don't have clue what we are doing? In fact we have already a lot of people that we only communicate through PGP.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:06:51
I agree! Sorry for being late!
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:06:45
So many Blockchain companies are going to be there. We just found out about Korbit, BTCC, Shapeshift and many more
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:02:36
It was from an external wallet and the time is messured from the moment our customer paid the invoice. We release the money with regular customers after 1-3 confirmations
@_date: 2015-11-30 11:27:38
You can use all4btc.com to order on amazon if you don't want to deal with these kind of issues
@_date: 2016-05-17 12:31:15
Feel free to try  instead. We never had problems with any of the banks mentioned 
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:55:42
Nice! We are glad that we can help you spend your coins!
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:55:57
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:56:20
Totally! Bitcoin is back!
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:23:12
sure! What do you do? How is your budget for a marketing video?
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:00:30
we offer it cheaper, faster and a better exchange rate. To top it all up Bitwala is way older than both of them and went live with bills4btc since early 2013. Only legal stuff was putting us back in Germany
@_date: 2015-10-22 12:15:52
Yes, international wires work already in USD. Because of legal issues we can't serve the US yet
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:02:39
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:40:01
no true. We don't have that yet. That is true
@_date: 2015-10-07 14:19:17
Just to be precise, this article is posted on our blog. This is where I write my articles and this article is not about Bitwala. So I don't understand the complain. It's about Bitcoin. And the refugees "donations" was no donation. It was an offer to use our service for free if you are a refugee. We are in cooperation here in Berlin with a NPO and we educate the refugees how to use it. If you like that or not, I don't think this is something why you should loose your trust in us.
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:46:29
Don't you see all the Bitcoins on the big screens? :-)
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:33:41
We serve Canada already. We have many Canadian users so feel free to order your card :-)
@_date: 2016-05-13 08:46:06
Hey. Please get in touch with our support staff, we are happy to help you.
@_date: 2016-05-11 08:06:22
Somebody else published it with the original title and it was gone from the front page within a few minutes. I thought that is not enough for such a great article. Sorry, just wanted to help
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:55:09
Thank you! We are always trying our best to keep the fees low
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:54:49
Sorry. We will do that in the future^^
@_date: 2016-05-12 10:36:14
International money transfers based on the Blockchain
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:01:28
but we changed our exchange rate today. When did he do this comparison?
@_date: 2015-10-22 14:23:55
Yeah Bitcoin never sleeps :-) plus it's afternoon in Europe already
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:04:42
You can display any exchange rate on the front page, what counts is what you end up paying in the end. And there we are cheaper than cashilla. Don't know why, but it's true. Try
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:02:17
check it by trying to withdraw money . We are always cheaper than cashilla if you include the fees :-)
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:54:24
Very soon. At the moment we can top GBP accounts only with EUR so the exchange rate is up to PayPal
@_date: 2016-05-12 13:56:44
(except for the US)
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:38:39
good question :-) That was supposed to be an additional answer to jani8x. Sorry
@_date: 2016-05-12 13:55:41
That means that you can send money to any bank account worldwide and pay with Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:34:22
Almost all countries worldwide (except the US)
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:07:44
The 2-3% will be charged from the mergents so for the customer it is basically free
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:37:51
We don't do that. We only did it for two days, since there was a problem with our website. All customer who sent us the documents did it using PGP. But I agree it was not the best solution. Sorry for that
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:44:05
Thank you! We try our best.
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:11:23
That is indeed true, but it was meant just in case he wants to spend some
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:48:03
He went on stage on the Pioneers Festival here in Vienna and in his background were only Bitcoins displayed 
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:24:00
I used it all over the world and I never had problems, so UK should be fine. At least until Brexit :-)
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:16:43
The blog is about Bitpay too. Did you read it?
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:24:01
Is coinbase fee already included?
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:25:02
I pay my Beer since 5 years in Bitcoin there, never had any problems
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:10:35
of course :-) at the moment it seems even you get two different Bitcoins for the price of one :-)
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:59:09
Great article! We published an article a few months ago about the same topic.
[Bitcoin doesn't have the properties of money, it changes them](
Loved the "Store of value" section :)
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:23:09
no, you can use it with all bills that we are able to pay with SEPA
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:01:28
so which exchange rate do you use then? bitstamp or do you have your own one?
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:56:15
But also a Hero needs to buy stuff at places where Bitcoin is not accepted (yet)
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:22:30
We will convert them in Euro directly. We are working on keeping it in bitcoin until you send it though! Soon to be available on Bitwa.la
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:56:29
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:51:37
Is it possible to see your exchange rate? Do you display it somewhere on your web page? 1% fee is okay, if the exchange rate is good :-)
@_date: 2016-05-10 14:08:36
That is so true! We love Bitcoin and we would love to make it Bitcoin only but I've personally been living on and of Bitcoin since 3 years and I can assure you that it is impossible to do so without the help of intermediates at the moment. As soon as Bitcoin is widely accepted we can talk about removing certain functionalities from Bitwala 
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:05:48
The question is more. What does wirexapp offer what Bitwala doesn't? :-)
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:50:26
absolutely right :-)
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:08:58
It is simply a wallet with a bank account attached. The wallet has the same functionality as any other wallet. You hold your keys, you are your bank. We see us as service on top to keep your euro save no matter how much of them you need to handle your day to day live. On top we are crypto first, so no user will ever get a closed bank account just because he is trading Bitcoin. I got several accounts closed just because of Bitcoin activity. I think that needs to stop and Bitwala is our way of stopping this
@_date: 2016-07-22 07:26:18
You're welcome! Happy cakeday!
@_date: 2016-07-21 05:31:47
That is correct. Here's the complete list: 
@_date: 2016-07-21 05:33:34
That's not correct, we offer international USD transfers to pretty much any country in the world (with the usual exception of the US).
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:11:57
Please read my answer above. You hold your private keys in the Bitwala wallet. If you don't hold the private keys it is not your money!
For your request. Get your money paid on our bank account and swop it right away to Bitcoin. You don't even need to ask your employer to pay you in Bitcoin. You can do that yourself. That is why we think we need it.
It is not only a way out of crypto, it is a way into crypto too.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:38:08
We are not one of those! We just make sure that your fiat stays where it is
@_date: 2016-07-21 05:34:50
Care to elaborate? Compared to our competitors, we are currently offering the best rates available on the market.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:10:25
Thank you. I think the same way
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:05:25
Hi Jonathan! We love what Bitwage is doing. Keep up the solid work!
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:47:14
I am afraid that I have to disagree. I am in this channel longer than you and this was always my way of getting all information all around Bitcoin. Since we are no shit coin wallet and running exclusively on Bitcoin I can't picture a better place to inform people about our progress. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 11:22:33
If you like to get in touch with bitcoin advisers, make an appointment via mail or phone. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:35:50
If you think Bitcoin is only used for tax avoidance then you are probably right. I really do think you are wrong though and many people who use Bitcoin are paying their taxes properly 
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:19:42
We need tools to enable people to use it on a day to day basis otherwise we will fail. If you ask people in mainstream, almost everyone in the developed world has a bank account. It is way easier to get people into Bitcoin when it easy to use and secure.
I know there are different opinions but for me in Germany a banking licence is just a company that proofed that it is capable of holding fiat save on the user's behalf.  I really do think that Bitwala will be a major improvement for the community in Germany and Europe.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:08:57
Yes, really high on our list. Even though that is indeed the wrong channel to talk about ETH. We will make an announcement on when the time is right
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:33:19
no.. not yet
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:44:30
Well said! Thank you
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:43:16
Yes, we are an intermediary. But ask yourself: Where would Bitcoin be without Bitpay and others? No shops would have excepted it, no way to spend it and therefore, no adoption at all. 
If you believe me or not: I am happy to close Bitwala if we succeeded in making Bitcoin widely used but until then many people will be happy and thankful to have us!
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:08:01
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:05:53
It is not about your Bitcoins. In the Bitwala wallet you are the holder of your private key at all time! 
We are crypto enthusiasts and we love Bitcoin, but the matter of fact it is getting harder and harder for people to purchase things offline or spend it online. In Berlin, just a few places kept accepting Bitcoin.
That is why we call it a bridge. You keep your money in crypto, nobody can take it away, nobody can confiscate your coins but if you need to pay and the shop is not accepting it you have now the possibility to pay where ever with your Coins. I think generally that is an improvement for the community not something bad. 
On top many people like to trade and so they use Euro or USD as a trading pair. Nowadays people are relying on Tether and Exchanges to keep their trading liquidity and we all saw on Mtgox or recently cubits how these things can end. Don't even get me started on tehter or other "stable coins". 
I struggle to see any downside of having a safe environment for your fiat money and have a gateway to pay your landlord, your electricity, your gas using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:06:25
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:07:04
:-) Sorry :-) 
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:39:01
So what is the problem? Do what you do with your coins but how do you pay your landlord, how do you pay for electricity if they don't accept Bitcoin? We don't want people to store their coins on our wallets. They can use what ever they want, but if you need cash, a withdraw or an option to pay online you can use us. I don't see any issue with privacy
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:37:11
Bitbond is awesome and totally trustworthy. I did not use them personally but I know the team and they are legit.
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:26:41
works all over Europe and in all currencies. But keep in mind the exchange rate. We will transfer Euroamounts and the bank will change it to your local currency
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:13:20
Thanks! On top the banking part keeps your EUR save in the time when YOU decide you need fiat. We don't want to be Bitgox!
@_date: 2013-07-23 07:41:28
buy things :-D all4btc.com or e4btc.com
@_date: 2013-07-25 17:08:42
Thanks for the tip!

In Berlin, a single room at LekkerUrlaub costs 40 Euro. :) 
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:43:06
Okay, we will add some of that kind in the future. Thanks for your advice!
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:42:53
we lowered it now to 5%
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:44:06
No, but it will work in a few days
@_date: 2013-07-19 12:32:10
Please try again, we just fixed the form.
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:42:24
We tried, but Amazon kicked us out of the affiliate programm right away :-(
@_date: 2013-10-24 12:32:19
satoshinator.com is our shop. We designed all shirts ourselves. most of the shirts are in stock and can be shipped right away. The others can be delivered within a few days
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:40:00
That is correct. We are no custodians. Keep your money on your trezor, ledger or keepkey. We don't want your crypto. We want it easy to spend and easy to get into. That is why we call it bridge 
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:57:51
If the merchants deliver a tracking code we gonna forward to your email, otherwise you have to trust your postal system.
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:49:23
we changed that to 5% already
@_date: 2013-07-19 13:54:56
Sorry, at the moment we are implementing automation of Ebay orders and there might be some mistakes with the website today. You can contact us via mail and we will order your product manually right away
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:09:27
For sure, it is legit. We have been quite busy!
Here is the last one:
And we got a quote a few minutes ago:
"Man you guys rock!!!  Thank you very much for the service.  
BTW, I had used a service very similar to yours before.  The transaction was smooth but they did not communicate about the ordering or shipping.  I LOVE the fact that you have the order page and you communicate about the shipping and ordering.  I will spread the word about your service for sure!
Thank you again!"
@_date: 2013-07-01 21:20:46
Thank you very much, now we can upgrade some toupets :)
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:32:41
The purchase will be on our account. You're account won't be touched for our service. 
We already pasted a few orders and it worked quite well. What kind of problems do you expect?
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:48:10
Our webdesigner really likes his pictures :-) But I will talk to him again
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:52:22
okay, there I have to agree. We have one shit coin on the platform :-D 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:58:02
We are glad to be bridge builder and to establish opportunities for the bitcoin community. we go shopping for you because it feels good to be Santa Claus, neither a thief.

Cool, just another bitcoin store, unfortunaly your theme is not very creative^^
@_date: 2013-06-06 09:40:17
of course, but we have our focus on Europe.

This is the best overview for offline merchants accepting the future of money in Berlin.
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:42:01
should we skip the euro price or what would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-08-14 10:34:01
@_date: 2013-07-26 12:12:09
Try our service, we won't have this problem. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:28:56
we have a big problem with our supplier. He only delivers the texts in german. we are working on that problem..
@_date: 2013-06-18 07:59:18
hi.. 
in our case, there is no human involved in the order processing through amazon orders. You order in real time on amazon.
@_date: 2013-07-29 10:55:55
just buy stuff instead of changing BTC back to evil money :-) Visit all4btc.com or e4btc.com
@_date: 2013-06-03 15:37:03
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:47:11
we will work on that with pressure!
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:17:06
The exchange rate is calculated using [BitPay's exchange rate method]( and the service is 5%. 
We are in the process of adding this info to the site.
@_date: 2013-06-18 07:57:15
:-) try to ask at places where they don't take "real" money
@_date: 2013-07-16 18:28:06
Berlin: Room 77 and many more
@_date: 2013-07-19 15:23:35
now it is working again..
@_date: 2013-07-19 13:50:35
it is definitely working for .de and .uk. We are working on automatisation for .fr, too.. But you can always use "buy everywhere" and we will order it manually on amazon.fr
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:06:03
thanks! We will change that!
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:25:45
The main points are: fees to the banks, fees to our paymentprovider, fees for rent and for our developers. There is almost nothing left after this. We work only for bitcoinprojects since january and we (the founders) didn't get a single cent yet.
I know it sucks but when you work in bitcoin business you will realize that you don't have so many supporters in banks and suppliers, they always try to charge you more than they do to other costumers.
@_date: 2013-07-25 13:35:07
I just tried everything and it doesn't show any error. When does it show up?
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:34:22
Die Bafin ist über unsere Schritte informiert und wir arbeiten eng mit ihnen zusammen
@_date: 2013-06-25 11:54:36
friends of us are running the page. We really like it and you find all bars and restaurants in berlin who accept bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2013-07-16 18:23:50
hey! we are located in Berlin and always open for a b4b (beer for bitcoins :-)) just contact us if you want help or advice what to do in Berlin
@_date: 2013-08-26 14:04:51
No that won't happen to us. Bitcoin is legal in Germany and our Bank is bitcoin friendly, so please don't worry
@_date: 2013-07-19 08:36:47
pity, but very cool that you have the courage to look forward, some arguments if you have to convince somebody: donate anonymously, small amounts, no monthly fee, no contract, no spam mails, no phone calls...
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:27:02
We lowered our fee to 5% and we are sorry for not metioning it in the title. We are still learning so next time, we'll put it in!

Hi! Please ask around, we are from bitcoinsberlin and are also running e4btc.com, bills4btc.com and several other bitcoin projects
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:12:21
What would you think about, that we offer shipment to the US?
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:59:08
You don't need an archive. You can see all of them on the bitpay page. Check the links above :-D
@_date: 2013-07-20 16:29:09
That would be nice of you. We really care about our costumers and what the community thinks of our work. Thank you for your patience and your cooperation. We hope that you'll be back for another try.
@_date: 2013-06-12 12:39:32
Our main project is to help unbanked people to pay their bills online. The idea came up because so many people are trying to live only on bitcoins, but it is simply not possible at the moment. We want to help them.
We are not handling large amounts only what you need for a living. In addition we are only handling bills to wellknown large companies in rent, electricity, communication and small utility industry. Just not usefull for money laundring don't you think? 
We hope so.. 
If you have more ideas for preventing the miss use of the page, please contact us.

@_date: 2013-05-27 15:31:02
We tried to convince amazon many time to accept it! But they didn't, with this service we want to show them, that bitcoin should be taken seriously and if we succeed with our project we'll be out of this bussiness.
@_date: 2013-06-03 15:37:59

@_date: 2013-05-24 15:01:37
we are really sorry. We will never be so melodramatic again, but we love this project, we worked hard on it and we were so happy to launch it, that we forget to remain calm.
Sorry again..
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:26:59
done :-D
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:06:42
we will try that. thank you for your advice!
@_date: 2013-07-26 12:21:08
Trust in a mean of the medium exchange is still required, but for the functions of money not. For sure, thank you.
@_date: 2013-08-10 07:10:56
relatively new and took the theme from an already existing one :-) This is a real copy cat :-)
@_date: 2013-07-09 09:39:13
you can order on all shops on the web with all4btc.com

@_date: 2013-07-20 09:17:25
Now, I know who you are. We were wondering why you didn't wrote again. We took the travel page down because of the mistake that happened with you and we won't bring it back until we figured out a solution to prevent mistakes like the one that happened with you.
We are really sorry, we have to answer so many mails per day, so I think your last one wasn't found by our stuff. Normally we refund right away, if some mistake shows up.
Please send us your bitcoin address to our email address. You'll have your coins back on Monday morning! 
Sorry for this.
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:35:42
This is our first project! We would love to get some feedback!!
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:38:41
That's right! We thought about offering this service and figured out the same.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:08:27
The press release is actually a blog article from bitcoin.de:
The Bitcoin account on Fidor bank is work in progress, so let's wait for their press release :) Even the CEO Matthias Kröner does lots of interview &amp; guests articles in german business newspapers &amp; bitcoin magazines... I guess it is about the keyword.
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:20:06
I might go, but we have so much to do at the moment, that we might skip today. Next month I'll be there again.
Could you send us the pictures of the error to info at bitcoinsberlin.com ?
Thanks for your help! We really appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-08-09 11:16:18
No worries! I am glad that you asked. Don't hesitate to ask if more questions show up! 
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:08:24
Hi everyone,
We are the guys from bitcoinsberlin! 
Please feel free to have a look at our site  and don't hestitate to contact us if you have any questions about our shops. 
We are a official registered business located in Berlin (Germany). Our goal is to help bitcoin users to have access to all kinds of products. 
toys4btc.com and e4btc.com are just the beginning of a number of shops we hope to open in the coming weeks!
Bitcoin is here to stay and we are helping to make it happen!
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:12:53
We try to hold some coins, but actually we have to pay for our new office and bitcoin meeting point &amp; several other regular issues.
Your bitcoins are coming back into the system, Bitpay sells them on exchanges e.g. Bitstamp. For a stable market you need buyer &amp; seller!
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:49:08
:-D we're almost there (Fidor Bank AG in Germany)
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:20:32
We'll soon bring an update to make it work on ebay, too.
@_date: 2013-08-09 15:32:42
all4btc.com and e4btc.com :-)
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:19:11
We are adding this info to the site for more transparency. Also, we offer support via email and telephone.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:17:49
you would really help us with some feedback. What could be improved? Any help is appreciated!
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:20:04
Hi! No ebay and amazon will be ordered automatically after the payment is confirmed. Only "buy everything" is done by our support team manually..
Sorry, you can't use our service for auctions yet. Only instant buying is possible right now
If the seller offers tracking codes, we will pass that to our costumers. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:03:19
I don't understand that. We talked everything through with our bank and there was no problem at all. Why should they close our account? Our Bank and Germany in general is way more bitcoinfriendly and we will never have the same problems like in the US.
@_date: 2013-09-24 12:49:35
On all4btc.com you order in real time on amazon and ebay
@_date: 2013-08-07 15:59:34
we are located in Germany, not in the US. Our bank is fine with what we are doing. In case of bitspend the bank dicieded to close their accounts, which can't happen to us
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:34:34
You were right, this is why we lowered our fee!
@_date: 2013-07-20 08:18:10
this must be a mistake, please contact us via email to find a solution!
@_date: 2013-08-09 10:47:57
We are not turning bitcoin into Euro. Bitpay is doing that, this is why bitpay has a money transmitter licence. We are buying products in euro and sell them for Bitcoin, Bitpay is making the exchange for us.
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:46:04
I like to use the internet archive wayback machine - because they accept bitcoin for donations ;)
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:33:22
No we cannot offer amzon prime. That would be against amazons rules
@_date: 2013-08-09 09:43:25
We are not moving money. We are normal reseller of products and by German law we are allowed to take which currency we ever want as a payment. Since January German Government even allows officially accepting bitcoin as a payment for products. 
Just a few days ago Fidor bank partnered with bitcoin.de to create a bankaccount were you can have both bitcoins and Euro on your account in the future and in that way buy and sell bitcoins instantly. 
Why the hell should this bank close any bitcoin related accounts since they are working in the bitcoin economy too? 
Like I told you before things are different in Germany if you take bitcoin as payment for products you don't have to worry at all
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:32:16
We just tried it and everything went fine. At what moment did the error show up? After you filled in the address? Did you get to the bitpay site?
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:27:39
not anymore. Now it is 5%.
@_date: 2013-08-12 07:01:57
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:29:16
good point.. we will add that.. thanks!
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:52:40
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:34:55
is in progress. It'll be online soon!
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:15:26
Our bridge builder all4btc is an escrow shopping service for your coins, just to showcase the opportunity they miss ;) 
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:08:49
We will get better prices from our suppliers if we sell more 5000 €. As soon as we achieve that we will give that right to our costumers. The same will happen with 10 k of sales and 50k of sales.
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:43:36
Yes, we are. Check out website 
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:45:39
You can be relieved, it is no scam. We are from bitcoinsberlin.com. We do many project all around bitcoins
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:45:49

@_date: 2013-04-30 18:27:20
What? Sorry, we will fix that as fast as possible! We are really sorry!
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:28:14
thanks so much for your advice! We will try to do so as fast as possible!
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:39:31
Could you send us a screen of the error and the steps before the error showed up? Which browser do you use?
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:07:10
Our site all4btc.com accepts Bitcoin payments for "Buy it now" eBay orders, as well as Amazon.com orders. Unfortunately we had to temporarily close the site to restructure our order processing method, but it should be back online very soon (today). 
@_date: 2013-07-25 14:36:04
Maybe you tried during our update, normally that error should show up anymore
@_date: 2013-07-16 12:45:19
we will put the stickers in our shop within the next weeks.. I will keep you updated
@_date: 2013-06-25 11:52:13
yes! bitcoinkiez.de
@_date: 2013-07-25 13:30:05
Great, thanks! It's on the list!
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:41:23
Thank you for your honest opinion. What can we do better? We are still experimenting with the designs.
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:47:54
We think so too! But still, maybe here is someone on reddit with interesting thoughts, we can ask or tell him
@_date: 2013-06-12 12:30:42
Thank you! We really appreciate that and what you are doing for Bitcoins in the US! Please let us know if we can help you with anything.
@_date: 2013-07-19 09:28:48
