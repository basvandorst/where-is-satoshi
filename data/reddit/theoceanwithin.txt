We had a congressman on the science committee who said many times that the bible and his faith was proof enough for his way of thinking and science with all its evidence was the devil trying to deceive him.

Isn't this because Chinese exchanges are now using bots to trade two accounts back and forth along with double counting a bitcoin transaction. Person A sends bitcoin to Person B and this counts as two transactions, as A sends and B receives. Without a standard we now have people falsifying data...

I think I would be happier keeping my bitcoins.

Just to point out: You have not gained anything until you sell your coins. Just like stock you can not say you gain or lose cash until you have it transferred into cash.

When people search for bitcoin they may be looking at anything related to it from gambling, to forums to talk to others, etc. I don't think Google wallet, Apple, or isis wallet have any big forum to discuss current events related to their product but might exist within a broader scope.

How will they survive without a $0.10 donation!

People are actually downvoting you. Holy crap.

An obvious ponzi scheme collapsed? You don't say.

No. Cash is used as a universal form of a standard for a country. It sets the worth of other objects you can trade or be used to pay for work done. It is pretty much a unit for worth that fluctuates minimally enough to be useful in these situations.

The creator has to offer to place it onto Netflix. People asking for it to be put on is pointless as only the owner of the film can give consent to have it put there.

Time to buy while the price is bottoming out! Find some change and buy while the price is right!

Good to hear someone who knows when to stop. Once you are ready you can always jump back in. Some people here act like you just put a knife through their grandma's heart by selling.

Because this is the fad of the month for bitcoin on this sub... This place works like an echo chamber at times that I am sad about. People latch onto one thing and can't stop sperging about it for a month at a time.

Was it Greece that had a guy create a start up Bitcoin company only to flee the country with a warrant out for his arrest because he took all the Bitcoins and funds for himself?

Holding means nothing if others are selling, some who do not even belong to reddit are selling as everyone has a stop value that they will bail out of an investment in case it hits. To those who will hold even if it hits $1, well that's fine but at that point many investors would have left and will not return.

No chargebacks. Sorry. 
Also no revenge unless you are willing to pay a reward. It might have to be big to go up against this guy.

Sell them and forget the current wallet. Create a new one and buy more bitcoins into the new location and do not use your name this time.

Ah yes thank you. Got my island nations mixed up.
