If you actually stumbled upon a non-zero address, I think it would actually be incumbent upon you to move the coins, given the insane, universe-defying odds of that happening. The act itself would be far more significant than the value of any coins that could be stored there.

Okay, so if direct Blockchain transactions rise above the cost of using a credit card, then the value proposition collapses for most people in the developed world. At the same time, if Lightning requires you to tie-up your funds while credit cards let you essentially use their money, interest free no less, for a month, then why use Lightning?
Remittance, darkmarkets, micropayments... sure.
Anything else... Why bother?

But the nodes eventually need to settle, so it's not offchain forever. However, if you can't get your settlement into a block before the lockout time expires, you are so out of luck.

Not trying to spread FUD. This stuff is just fairly difficult to understand from a layperson perspective. I honestly don't understand the lockout time stuff well enough and thought I had read that there is some risk of losing funds if settlement can't occur on time. If this is wrong, my apologies.
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:37:39
I'm still not fully getting why NLOCKTIME doesn't deprive the receiver of the funds you've spent if the node doesn't settle in time. Can you clarify this? ELI5?
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:10:16
Off-chain defeats the whole point of Bitcoin. Bitcoin derives its value from its utility, so off-chain doesn't make a very compelling use-case. That being said, trustless solutions like Lightning look amazing, but when will be using it, 2018?
When I walk into a coffee shop in 2018, will the merchant insist that any Bitcoin transactions take place over Lightning instead of a zero conf on the blockchain? Will this not ultimately hurt Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:43:24


What about when settlement needs to take place by the receiving party and the blocks are completely full? It's a scenerio where the receiver could eventually lose the funds if they can't settle in time (due to limited blocksize), and the funds revert back to the sender.


Except merchants will probably insist on Lightning transactions instead of Blockchain transactions, and suddenly YOU CAN'T SPEND your bitcoins without Lightning, at least IRL. Maybe that's fine, I don't know, it just feels like it sort of neuters "bitcoin proper".
Also, what's the fee to these Lightning nodes? The value proposition of bitcoin decreases further...
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:00:14
So if the fees are lower on Lightning than the blockchain (by the way, I agree that this will be the outcome), then wouldn't users simply use Lightning for every transaction whether its low or high value? Why would you ever do a direct blockchain transaction, when Lightning is cheaper and instant? I guess Bitcoin is destined to be an asset rather than a currency. Hopefully, people see the value in having digital gold.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:38:31
Okay, I'll defer to you, as I don't fully understand how Lightning works. How does the lockout time work then?

I'm just comparing the value proposition of Lightning with a conventional credit card.
Credit Card: 2%-3% fees hidden in the purchase price and 1 month interest-free loan, assuming you always pay-off your balance in full.
Lightning: Some unknown % fee and having to lock-up some amount of funds for a period of time. Also, you're probably paying the hidden credit card fee which merchants tend to pass along to all customers. If the merchant is relying on a Lightning node, then there is going to be an additional fee as well.
Bitcoin: Very small fee and not having to lock-up funds.
Just looking at it objectively, the credit card is probably the better value proposition when compared to Lightning.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:09:56
No. Banks are not going away, because most people are not prepared to "be their own bank". If Bitcoin ever takes off at a mainstream level, most people will have it held for them in banks. It's more analogous to Blockbuster vs Bittorrent, maybe.

Yeah, I've read them all and from a technical standpoint you're probably right. But currency has so much to do with perception, and that 7 tps doesn't help. I personally think 20 MB blocks is overkill, but some increase is warranted.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:06:00
So what happens if the recipient node can't settle on the blockchain before the lockout time expires due to limited blocksize? Answer: the recipient loses the funds as they revert back to the sender. Therefore, even in our bright Lightning future, we still need ample blocksize to ensure final settlement in a timely fashion.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:12:55


I get that, but let's pretend that demand increases 100X or 1000X. Suddenly, days may not be enough to get your settlement in a block.


Not necessarily. Nodes will be acting on behalf of many clients. In aggregate, all those coffee purchases will add up.

I think that because the transactions will be so low value, zero conf. will be good enough. If they take ages to hit the blockchain, it doesn't matter.
Perhaps, some off-chain method: your device simply exposes the private key of a one-off wallet to the recipient device who then sweeps the satoshis and pays the fee. Sort of like handing someone a paper wallet as a gift which includes the private key. That's basically an off-chain transaction that only requires that the recipient pay a fee to sweep the funds into their own wallet.

They just need enough mining power to win the block race often enough to do settlement. Maybe once per day is enough.

NYSE, Factom, etc... are colouring individual satoshis so in terms of volume, it shouldn't do much for Bitcoin on it's face. That being said, the wider acceptance of bitcoin could create a positive feedback loop driving the price up, as it garners more mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:54:31

Not quite. You can't use it to sign transactions. It's meant to be used like a bearer bond.

Bitcoin has value mainly due to regulatory arbitrage. If you are not under-served in your market (eg: you have access to a low interest credit card) then you have no reason to spend bitcoin. There can still be value in HODLing Bitcoin, however, as it does serve the under-served in certain situations. If something has value to someone, even if that someone is not you, then that something HAS value to you. Listen to some Bitcoin Uncensored podcast episodes, and everything will be made much clearer.

I get that, but are you saying that because it's only 24 grams of gold it would be less divisible than if it were 1 kilogram of gold? The reality is that gold is not physically moved when people transact in it. "Paper gold" is what gets moved around, so in this case 24 grams of gold is infinitely divisible on paper. So if we somehow found ourselves in a world where we were back on the gold standard, and the value of gold shot up to the moon, it wouldn't matter if the average person had 24 grams or 240 grams or 2,400 grams... scarcity is what gives it value and on paper you could be transacting in fractions of a gram, just like satoshis are fractions of a bitcoin.
Also, wealth is not distributed equally, and this is nothing to cry about either. The reason gold or bitcoin, or dollars have value is that there is a wealth inequality. If everyone had an equal amount of "tokens" the economy would not work.
By the way, how exactly does Bitcoin preserve equitable distribution? Last I checked, miners were not giving them out for free. Bitcoin is no different than gold in this regard.
I'm a big believer in Bitcoin, and not a gold-bug at all, but argument  holds no weight.

I'll just put in my 2 cents. 21 recently dumped their unsold Buttbox inventory on eBay under a fake seller account. They sold the units for as low as $40. I don't live in the US, so the border tariff slip revealed they were actually behind the dump. I goofed-off a bit in their Slack, they retaliated by suspending my email account and confiscating funds. They also doxxed a friend of mine. This company is a huge SCAM!

Fenton makes some great points in this interview: 
@_date: 2016-09-09 05:08:41
Sigh... seriously who gives a shit about Deloitte? If the path to Bitcoin's success is by licking the boot of multinational incumbents, then we've already lost.
The only appreciable, long-term way Bitcoin differs from the current banking system is by being censorship-resistant. This is inherently at odds with the existing system of KYC.
Bitcoin will not be a cheaper payment method, once subsidy of the externality costs ends and regulation is brought in. Bitcoin can't "play nice". Bitcoin has to continue to play out of bounds in order for it to have any value at all.
Dark markets, gambling, capital flight, money laundering: this is why you need Bitcoin! Why else would you need censorship-resistant money?
You don't need Bitcoin to buy a Tim Hortons coffee in Toronto! You have a credit card for that!
This is coming from a long-term hodler, by the way. I am speculating that there is, and will continue to be, demand for censorship-resistant money, but do I personally have any need to spend Bitcoin on anything as a first-world, banked, middle-class person without an illicit drug habit? No, of course not.
So why should I go get Bitcoin out of Deloitte's BTM at above-market prices?
Bitcoin doesn't need proselytizing to family members or friends. Hate to break it to you: you look like a complete loser if you do that.
Bitcoin's rise will happen all on its own (or not) based on it's ability to serve the under-served who require censorship-resistant money.
@_date: 2016-09-09 18:22:58
If that's actually true your going to have a line-up of drug addicts around the corner in no time. I've never heard of a BTM with a 1% fee. Kudos. Might be worth buying some with a burner phone.

I guess I just don't get it. For the record, I'm a long-term hodler. Here's the thing: I get paid in dollars. I use a credit card for the convenience, as well as the short-term, free loan. I pay-off the credit card in dollars. I don't see why I would want to spend my bitcoin like this? First of all I have to pay $10 for the card. Then I get to spend my bitcoins immediately (no short-term, free loan) or acquire loyalty points. My credit card pays me 1% in grocery points. So why would I spend my bitcoins through a debit card?
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:47:45
Fair point, but you are basically pointing out inefficiencies in the current system that allow Bitcoin to be faster and cheaper. Those inefficiencies will go away very soon.
@_date: 2015-11-01 04:01:15
I'm just a dumb-dumb but when I start reading about "checkpoints" in the whitepaper then it doesn't seem so trustless.
@_date: 2015-11-19 02:28:00
Okay, I'm speaking a bit out of ignorance here, but from my understanding here's how Payment Channels work: you set-up a multi-sig with two parties, so the funds can't be double-spent. You need to wait one confirmation (at least) to set-up the multi-sig because it has to be written to the blockchain. Once the channel is set-up, signed transactions can be sent between the parties instantly, because they are off-blockchain. I'm probably mangling the explanation.
@_date: 2016-05-10 22:47:45
Oh man, probably tossed it without checking... gotta go riffle through the trash like a raccoon!

It was a joke, by the way ;)
@_date: 2016-05-14 05:55:46
Okay, so is R3CEV pronounced like "receive"? 
@_date: 2015-11-01 04:13:41
From the white paper: "The idea is that, as a transaction gets more and more (direct or indirect) approvals, it becomes more accepted by the system; in other words, it becomes more difficult (or even practically impossible) to make the system accept a double-spending transaction."
Haven't read the white paper in depth, but the system sounds like if Bitcoin only had validating nodes, but without mining. So transactions are very fast, but lacks the indelible ledger part. Basically, you have to trust the validating nodes. Sort of a "nothing at stake" issue like Proof-of-stake.
It sounds like the system would be vulnerable to a 51% attack. If you have enough nodes providing the "approvals" then you can double-spend.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:55:28
Zero confirmations cannot be trusted. That's why we have mining.
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:11:44
The end by my fingers is fully encased in "goop". I think it's by design.
@_date: 2015-11-15 06:31:38
Define "criminal activity" as it applies on a global scale? Is skirting currency controls in China criminal? Technically, yes. Is doing remittance cross-border to your family, and bypassing the expensive red tape criminal? Technically, yes. Is buying drugs off a darkmarket site criminal? Well, duh...
The reality is, the censorship resistant properties of Bitcoin only have value because someone, somewhere is trying to commit a "crime" of some sort. You can argue that they are merely breaking an "unjust" law, but the fact remains that laws are being broken. Why else would you require censorship resistance in your money?
If the Blockchain Alliance succeeds in it's stated goal, then it's the end of Bitcoin.
Gavin can't be this naive/stupid. I used to really respect him, but he doesn't seem to even grasp the fundamentals of why Bitcoin would have any value whatsoever.
Inefficiencies in the established, centralized, controlled system will eventually go away, likely with the help of private blockchains to speed-up settlements... ironic. 
The only real value in Bitcoin, that can't be copied, is censorship resistance.

Perhaps the time-traveller is from a 1984-esque distopian future where all our moves are tracked on the blockchain. The 51% attack is designed to destroy the blockchain and change the course of history.

@_date: 2015-02-03 06:58:34
What does the amount transacted matter then? Are you saying "lots of transactions" above a certain dollar threshold are acceptable and don't cause bloat, but "lots of transactions" below a certain dollar threshold do? Gavin wants to raise the block size limit to 20 MB and keeps making allusions to Visa-level activity (2000 transactions/second). Is that bloat?
@_date: 2015-02-03 07:03:51
One more point: bitcoin either scales-up or dies in the long-run. It's a binary outcome. I'm not saying bloat isn't a technical challenge, but it has to be solved in some way, because transactions "within reason" isn't going to cut it.

Wouldn't paying by credit card through a service like PayPal or Stripe shield your credit card info? You make a good point though about online transactions which I hadn't considered.

What about sending a 100 BTC without a fee, is that spam? Miners have a right to either include or not include a transaction. Spam is in the eye of the beholder. But let's just say for the sake of argument that every micro transaction is accompanied by a transaction fee, it's no longer spam, right?
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:29:47
Okay, you made some very good points. What are your thoughts on the Lightning Network proposal? Any significant downsides?
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:59:48
Oh I completely agree, it should absolutely be opt-in, not opt-out and for that reason the banks are definitely at fault. But they should still be able to offer the service and I find nothing wrong with the service as it's a convenience and safety net. It's like insurance. Comparing it to Bitcoin because Bitcoin doesn't offer this service is rather silly.
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:04:41
You use a debit card. You are not richer than me. No one with any concept of finance would use a debit card instead of a credit card. I'll lay it out for you, and you can lie and pretend you are worth more than me: I have a house worth $900,000 with a $150,000 mortgage left on it. That's $750,000. I also have about $100,000 in other investments. My wife has assets too. So between the two of us we have about a million in assets. I can't wait til you post your response where you claim you have 10 MILLION DOLLARS!!!!!
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:46:00
Okay, fair enough, but ideas at least provide reassurance that there is actually a path forward. If the first implementation sucks, but the idea is sound, then a better implementation will eventually come along. Does Lightning Network at least provide us with a reasonable path forward to VISA-level transaction volume, as they claim, without the pitfalls inherent in centralization?

@_date: 2015-02-25 03:18:32
Well okay, I'll play devil's advocate: what have we been doing up until now? Seems like we've had ledgers for thousands of years that have had the potential to be manipulated (and sometimes were) and yet the world kept spinning.
What I'm asking is, essentially, this: Is a trustless ledger actually as valuable as it's made out to be?
I go back and forth on this myself.
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:58:11
Why isn't anyone talking about the  proposal? It would allow Bitcoin to scale to VISA level proportions?
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:13:19
okay, so is there a conceivable way forward to VISA-level transactions in the future, or is that unrealistic altogether?
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:27:30
I get it, but you know what I actually appreciate having it. I have money going into my account and coming out of my account all the time. I treat it like a transactional account: paycheque goes in, bills come out. What has happened once in a blue moon, is that a bill has been taken out before the pay cheque top-up, and the reason why there was no disruption is because of the overdraft "feature". I have another account with no overdraft at all, so it's definitely something you can tell your bank to turn off if you're irresponsible with your money. So it's silly to compare it with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:48:10

It didn't fall out of the sky. Satoshi's work was built on top of many previous works, including Adam Back's Hash Cash concept. I remember reading about that a decade ago as an anti-spam technique. Satoshi's brilliance was putting all the pieces together.

Yeah, remittances are definitely a good use case. I guess my question is as a first world citizen with no need for remittances, is there any reason, other than ideological, that I should be spending in Bitcoin rather than fiat?
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:32:52
So here is my criticism: when people say "bitcoin will eventually scale to VISA-level amounts" they are talking about the "VISA" of today. Bitcoin needs to scale to the VISA-level of tomorrow. I'm in Canada where we have NFC credit cards. I literally tap to pay for anything. I buy a coffee... I tap to pay. I buy something for 50 cents, I tap to pay. I could easily rack up 10 or 20 transactions some days. That is the VISA of tomorrow x 7 billion people... or 9 billion people, etc...
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:19:44
Okay, but please ELI5, these hubs, can they do bad stuff? I got the impression that the fallback is just waiting for a confirmation on the actual blockchain, which is fine. Anything else hubs can do to be evil beyond holding-up a transaction until a first confirmation?
@_date: 2015-10-05 04:17:22
Forget about 21 and that specific product. Think about the concept itself. If someone can build a cheaper version, that's great. Market forces at work.
@_date: 2015-11-19 01:26:21
The limitation of that approach is having to wait 10 minutes each time you open a new channel with someone. Lightning promises instant transactions after opening a channel once.
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:49:37
So you use fiat to buy bitcoin in order to purchase goods and services from merchants that likely convert it back into fiat immediately? At the same time, you give up the ability to dispute charges as well as the 1%-2% cashback that most credit card companies give you? Do these merchants at least make it worth your while by discounting their goods by at least 3%?
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:28:43
I've been in Bitcoin since Spring of 2013. I bought my first bitcoin for about $150 off Localbitcoins. I now own about 4 bitcoins which were purchased anywhere from $250 - $800. I am not new to this. At the same time, I'm not drinking the Koolaide. Why don't you have a credit card? Credit cards provide FREE short term loans with cash back, assuming you pay your bill on time. When I hear people use a debit card for purchases, it tells me they probably aren't good with money, and can't trust themselves with a credit card. No offense.

@_date: 2015-02-03 03:56:54
If you're tipping, confirmations aren't necessary the way I see it, because you're not going to double-spend against your own generosity. Therefore, you don't need to attach a miner fee (because who cares how long it takes to confirm). So why go off-chain at all? If you really want to include a miner fee for faster confirmation, I think 5 cents is still reasonable for a micro transaction in most cases. It's 5 cents... even if you're only tipping 5 cents and the fee equals 100% of the tip, we're still talking about 5 measly cents.
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:00:30
Because you aren't actually using bitcoin/blockchain as a payment method when you use a gift card. Bitcoin's value is derived from its utility. If you remove it's utility, it has no value.

@_date: 2015-02-24 03:26:04
Is it still considered dust if its accompanied by a big miner fee? I'm not saying it would make any sense to do so, I'm just curious to know if sending a single satoshi is considered "dust" in all instances, or only in instances where it's sent without a miner fee.
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:24:14
I would say that is the case in the long run. In the short run it caused a lot of pain, and issues we are still dealing with. Mt. Gox being the preeminent exchange basically dictated the price of bitcoin and was a centralized point in a decentralized network, so it is better they are gone. Let's not even talk about Karpeles who went a little crazy towards the end wanting to bake apple pies instead of hardening Mt. Gox's security.
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:30:36
...and how exactly does Bitcoin solve this problem? The "poorest" people will just end-up going into arrears with their service providers because there is no safety net. Perhaps overdraft should be turned off by default, and you have to request that your bank turn it on for you, if you feel you are responsible.
@_date: 2015-02-25 04:37:55
Sorry, but aren't overdraft fees simply a convenience fee? The idea being that you can go into the red and your bank spots you the money for a fee. I don't do this myself, but it's silly to say "that wouldn't happen with bitcoin!" Well duh, it's a "service" that the bank offers you. You don't actually have to take them up on the offer. It's the same with credit cards. I've never paid a credit card company a penny because I've always paid my bills on time, so it's a free, short term loan, and I treat it as such. If you want to pay the minimum on your balance, well there is a convenience fee for doing so. Again, this is a feature, not a flaw. I'm all for Bitcoin, but why wouldn't I use free, short term loans every month, if I'm fiscally responsible? It would be dumb to do otherwise, unless there was a discounted price of goods sold when using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:19:26

So then we have to rely on centralized micro-payment channels, right?

I know that it's "more private, more secure, etc..." how does that actually play-out in your day-to-day purchases?

You make a good point especially in light of recent credit card hacking scandals at Target and Home Depot. That being said, the credit card industry is moving towards single-use tokens rather than exposing numbers, which prevents fraud. Apple Pay uses these single-use tokens, for example. Also, anecdotally, I've never experienced credit card fraud, and if I did credit card companies typically reverse fraudulent transactions.

Mt. Gox was the biggest exchange at that point and they had "bots" doing rapid trading back and forth which pushed the price up. This is well documented. Google it.

2004 run-up was price manipulation by Karpeles and his willy bot. Therefore, it's reasonable to exclude the run-up in order to see a more natural price progression.

By the way, I read through it and sort of understand it but would love someone to ELI5. What are the potential issues?

What I'm asking is this: what would it cost to set-up an army of fake "hubs" whose sole purpose is to simply hold-up transactions? So you disconnect from one because of delay, you connect to another, and another, and another...
I'm just trying to see this from all angles, I'm not trying to troll. I think it's an exciting proposal, and I hope there aren't any fatal flaws because, frankly, Gavin's work doesn't look like it's going to pan out.

Yeah, but how do you know that the miner you've sent it to is actually going to win the block race?

Okay, so you spotted a spelling mistake. Have you read the PDF?

Nothing against Changetip, I think it's a creative solution and have used it myself. But the thing is this: bitcoin derives its value from its utility, otherwise its just a meaningless string of numbers. If you need a centralized middleman to move around small amounts of bitcoin, then why would you even need to involve bitcoin? Changetip could use dollars.

Whaaaaattttt???? I went and had a few beers, came back and the price spiked. Okay!

- decentralized ledger enabling a currency - OK
- does decentralized storage necessarily require a blockchain?
- Does decentralized chat necessarily require a blockchain?

Tierion is working on Blockchain VR. They are in stealth-mode, and not really talking about it at the moment. Q4 2017... big announcement.
Watch this video with their CEO:

That sounds like an ideological reason.

It's better in the ways a centralized database is better, but let's not kid ourselves that this doesn't betray the whole notion of bitcoin.
