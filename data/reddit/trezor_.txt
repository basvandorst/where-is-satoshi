If this was true, then we would see it reflected in network transaction volume.
But as a matter of fact, network transaction volume has fallen almost as much as exchange volume (~80% vs. ~90% from memory).
Anyone can verify this for themselves by looking at the charts on blockchain.info

You're missing the point. What I'm saying is not that they serve the same purpose, but that the purposes they serve are unnecessary. Ordinary people do not need ultra-secure wallets, and they're certainly not willing to pay out big $$$ for them. Trezors are at best a niche product for people with large amounts of Bitcoins or really dedicated Bitcoin believers like the people here.

My point is that people need hardware wallets like they need Bitcoin banks. It's a senseless waste of money, and I don't see why anyone would take you up on it.

I don't actually one want, I'm just saying that IF I actually was interested, I wouldn't pay more than $35. Not because I'm poor, but because I want value for money, and honestly a wallet to hold Bitcoins when I can already have free paper wallets, isn't worth that much to me.


I think so, or at least I know that they didn't do much. There was a lot of hype, just as there has been with Trezor, but not much of any substance. The problem with Neo &amp; Bee was that they were spending bucketloads of money, with very little revenue, and the whole purpose/service they were to provide was either very vague or non-existent. The latter is also what I see with Trezor.

I've already thought about that point and came to the conclusion that if they're ignorant or unwilling to secure their computers when dealing with Bitcoin, then why would they fork out $119 for a wallet?
I don't even know if this Trezor thing is easy to use. It doesn't look intuitive to me, and on their Facebook page I saw mention of Trezor browser plugins and mandatory firmware updates. For the type of person you describe, I don't think this is going to cut it.
Also, most people aren't going to be concerned about such excessive security measures. They'll just store their wallet on Windows out of ignorance or laziness, particularly if they're the type of person you describe, and in the vast majority of cases it'll work fine for them.

Would you spend $119 to insure $200?
Why not just use Tails if one is so concerned about security?
Who's to say that Trezor is secure anyway? Just because it's open-source it doesn't mean it won't be compromised.

Protip: Most people don't fall victim to malware that specifically searches for Bitcoin wallets. Those stories you've heard of most likely only represent a minority of people.
I have unencrypted wallets sitting on this hard drive right now, and have been doing it since 2010. Obviously I don't leave big amounts in them, but still, according to you I should have probably been 'hacked' by now.
It's like credit card details and/or internet banking passwords. These can also be recorded on a victim's computer through keylogging, yet falling a victim to this is uncommon.

When I read your comment I see "How can you not see the value in Neo &amp; Bee Bitcoin banking services?"
Completely opaque and lacking in substance.

I think it would need to be at least a few thousand to justify $119
We're talking about something which has no value other than as a device to store your Bitcoins. It doesn't entertain you or anything, so you're basically just throwing away money. How much can the average person afford to throw away? Or to put it another way, would you insure $1000 for $119? I certainly wouldn't.
I disagree with you that 'ordinary' people will use Trezors, just as these ordinary people didn't turn to Neo &amp; Bee Bitcoin banking services. 
Bitcoiners seem to think that if you take Bitcoin and repackage it in a familiar format, it's bound to succeed in attracting ordinary people. It's an odd recurring theme I'm noticing. I mean, it's not just startups like Neo &amp; Bee, but things like 'Bitcoin ATMs' - another disaster.
