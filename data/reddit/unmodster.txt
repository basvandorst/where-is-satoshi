Why can't we just do a soft or hard fork? Roll back only the transactions that were part of the hack? 
@_date: 2016-08-31 05:08:16
Yes. It's a public ledger. Show your ID and get a key. One per person. Complete transparency.
@_date: 2016-08-18 12:56:20
That's way over the head of most people. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:45:15
I'm not convinced.
@_date: 2016-08-31 13:26:14
Good point. I'm pretty sure there'd be a technical solution.
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:25:37
That's a nice meme, but please, explain it to me. A nice little soft fork and the bad guys don't screw over the good guys. Worst case, a hard fork and now we have two blockchains.

Yeah, ROTFL! He must have dropped this: /s

I like Louisiana! Good people and good food there. Try the boudin and cracklin. Mississippi on the other hand...

Ha ha, what ya gonna do? Vote? Meh. Just carry some scissors in your car.

Brilliant title!
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:29:16
Don't be naive.

Then make a "what's in the safe?" post on reddit and take pictures as you open it with power tools. Look! It's full of gold! Then sit back and watch the rabble lose their minds as you reap all that sweet sweet karma.

There is a higher law than the law of man. What is ethical is not always moral.

When the government controls big business, and fixes the price of everything, that is textbook *fascism*. FTFY
 Socialism  is when *we the people* control government. It's the same as  capitalism but everyone gets health care and an education and human rights. Capitalism is when big business controls the government and therefore the people.

He's the guy who jacked up the cost of that medication 15000%

Nice work. If I get rich day trading bitcoin on margin I'll buy one. If I get cleaned out by a margin call I won't, I'll instead ask you for a loan.

Nice bit of web design!

Still not worth $80,000 US to buy their silence. I'd just call my mom so she heard it from me first. Dad don't care.

RemindMe! 131 days "the halvening"
@_date: 2016-09-14 01:41:17
Oops! I meant to send 3.8 BTC instead of 38! Can we hard fork that?
@_date: 2016-09-03 15:36:54
Ah! Thank you. I had forgotten that term existed.
@_date: 2016-09-11 00:35:07
It's the wild west.

Boo hoo. I'm too old and I've been through too much b.s. to fall for this type of rhetoric anymore. Is there a name for the tactic CNN is employing in this article?
@_date: 2016-07-09 04:03:02
This looks promising. Has anyone tried it yet?
@_date: 2016-07-25 23:14:39
I thought it started because Lehman Bros. imploded.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:33:49
I think it will hang right where it is. The halvening is already priced in.
@_date: 2016-07-25 20:23:44
There would definately be a paper trail if you transfer title for a house. Same for a car. That's not necessarily a deal breaker though if you have a job or business as a front and aren't spending beyond your means. Someone who drives a nice car and owns fancy property who has no visible means of support would attract the attention of the authorities.

Does your rent include utilities? ;-)

Hey guys! I just made a rock solid investment in this new thing called Onecoin! I'm going to be rich! Party at my place tonight!
@_date: 2016-07-25 17:49:01
You could buy a house, a car, anything. Just transfer the bitcoin to the seller's wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-05 12:01:02
Why would I want to buy a bitcoin exchange traded fund instead of actual bitcoin?
