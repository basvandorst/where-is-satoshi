I would like to send to 1G3VSB, but I'm not quite sure how to double spend. I tried to just resend 0.127 to 1G3VSB and it told me my balance was insufficient (I wasn't sure what else would constitute a double spend). I'm really sorry about my ignorance here.

I've been receiving 1 satoshi randomly every couple of weeks/days, but I have no idea where they are coming from. Is that the cause of this problem? Thank you for all the help btw!!

It is fully sync'd, as I've had the wallet open on my computer for weeks. I also just shut my computer down and restarted it to make sure it was fully synchronized, but my transaction still sits at 0 confirmations.

ok sorry 1 second, doing it now

I'm quite new to using bitcoin and I don't quite understand how to do that, but I'll do some research. Is there any way I could cancel this current transaction and make a new one like you said?
@_date: 2014-05-30 09:27:39
Awesome stuff man, thank you so much for your help! I feel like such an idiot for saying this, but would signing it mean using the "sign message" feature in bitcoin-qt?
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:55:23
I've sent and received btc on this wallet for many months and I've never had this problem before.
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:57:59
did you do something with this already? i just got 1 confirmation on the previous transaction 
@_date: 2014-05-30 08:16:08
how do I make my wallet forget about it?
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:41:52
My wallet says it is fully synced up. It doesn't give me any sort of status like "pending" or anything like that, the transaction just sits at the top of my transaction history with "0 of 6 confirmations" beside it. When might the coins reappear in my wallet if they cannot be sent? Thank you for the help and advice by the way, I was freaking out a bit because I thought I may have permanently lost a good amount of money.

I believe this is the transaction id - 9d652e993e344182c7741d80c5066f228424a7e9eafc1676bfd7ec19d00dfc88
and I used this wallet
