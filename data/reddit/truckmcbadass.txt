Kind of like miner's fees?
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:52:22
What's the real deal with fees being higher and transfer time taking longer than other coins? Will other coins have the same problem when they have as many users?

Don't answer any further about your personal banking info.

Pics or gtfo.

It seems to have gained more this time than the others though, hasn't it? 
Btc is around 14.5 from its 19k around 12/17, and BCH is 2.7k from its 1.8k.
Maybe I'm looking at those numbers wrong, though?
I don't think we have much to gain by trying to compare price. We should talk about the tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:54:47
So what do you think BTC could do to solve the transaction and fees issue that I keep hearing about? 
Feel free to just link me to stuff if it's been talked about elsewhere. I'm fine reading.

Explain that crypto markets are volatile as hell, with no guaranteed profits, with plenty of coins that may have use cases that work (some might work for a long time, too), while others will be crap and potentially outcompeted. 
Btc is no different. Bch is no different. They could go up, and they could go down.
It's more fun than gambling, and has better returns than a casino.

I'm on mobile and this is fucking killing me. Literally feel my life force being drained from the husk of my body.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:01:23
Thanks for the quick responses. 
One last question: what's the deal with block size? Why do some people think bigger/smaller blocks are better? What are the downsides of messing with block size?

Sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place, but let me know if I understand this right:
If everyone adopts Segwit addresses, transactions will be much faster, and transaction fees will decrease? Is this right?
I've been asking other forums about Segwit and I've been told it wasn't helpful. I'd like to reach out here to see if there's any more info that I wasn't told about. I'm guessing "it wasn't helpful" because it's just not being used yet? 
If so, does anyone have info to point me in the right direction for the following questions? (I don't mind reading - send links my way):
* What's slowing people down from adopting Segwit? Is it a time consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else? 
* Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to? 
* What determines fees, to begin with?
* Are non-Segwit addresses still able to be created, or are all addresses moving forward going to be Segwit?
Thanks in advance!

Thanks for this!

Shit dude I wish I had a hundo to throw at some random starter cryptocurrency today. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:25:26
The Parking Lot Is Full was before its time. Comics are still archived online. Most of them. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:22:46
Yeah, but how many currently own it? Trying to think about how it's going to get adopted further based on current buy in levels.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:03:20
Buy low sell high, right?
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:07:55
What percent of the population owns Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:57:51
Funny how life works.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:38:35
What exchange let you use a credit card?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:19
That's definitely going to fuck things up a bit.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:09:54
Nah dude, late comers bought in at around 15k and are currently crying in a bathtub right now. Can you make a gif/vid of that?
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:28:32
Why not both?
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:24:27
Their chart formatting is off? Is that what you're upset about? 
Even Robinhood sometimes has a chart glitch.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:48:25
So... You're a scammer?
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:01:06
Lots of assholes in that comments section. I wanted to bust the kid's chops a little, but after reading some of the other posts I couldn't bring myself to it.
Edit: busy = bust
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:24:48
What is it?
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:42:09
So...you're saying there's a chance?
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:19:12
Kim really seems to have gone off the deep end. I think he tried to take advantage of the Seth Rich trend to try and get allowed entry into the US (where was he a year ago?). 
I'm staying far away from anything of his that asks for money until I know a lot more about it first.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:10:43
Yeah but the price is still accurate, right?
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:43:56
That would be neat. What's your projected timeline?
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:05:13
Wtf is dis?
