So let me get this straight. You asked a merchant to send you bitcoins. The merchant asked for your bitcoin address and your e-mail addresses. Then the merchant (not Coinbase) made the decision to send to your Coinbase account based on that e-mail address rather then the bitcoin address (separate from Coinbase) you provided? And how is this Coinbase's fault? 
Maybe I am not understanding this correctly. Are you reporting to Coinbase a security vulnerability? What is the API that you are referring to? Are you saying that Coinbase's API accepts an e-mail address and destination bitcoin address as parameters and Coinbase's API ignores the destinations bitcoin address if the e-mail address is associated with Coinbase? 
You need to provide more details. Just because everyone bashes Coinbase and exchanges lately doesn't mean they are all wrong all the time.
As an aside, it is unfortunate that the representative had to be a bit rude there. Not surprising given that their support teams are probably run by people that shouldn't be running support teams.

"BUY BITCOIN BUT DON"T USE BITCOIN!"
I get the logic of what you're saying, but this is all getting ridiculous. First, it was "want your TX confirmed? Include a higher fee!" Now I have higher fees and now the band-aid solution is "don't spend &lt; $200".
Next Spring the advice will be "Don't spend &lt; $5,000.. but don't worry, we'll get Bitcoin to those poor people in India soon!"

I'm not saying to buy both coins. What I am saying is if you got BCash for free because of the fork it doesn't hurt to keep it. Putting all your eggs in one basket isn't wise.
Funny thing is if BTC prices go down and BCH prices go up due to drama and if you have 1:1 holdings because of the "free" fork coins, then your overall portfolio in terms of dollars largely remains unchanged... But also, in general, both tend to go up together. Nice for stability and long-term growth.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:49
The smart thing was to always hold both to hedge your bets on either side.. and when it's necessary to sell some off, sell them off 1:1. 1 BTC + 1 BCH.... 5 BTC + 5 BCH... etc.
Edit: I was referring to those that got "free" coins because of the fork. I've seen people on both sides of the BTC vs BCH debates regret selling./trading their coins to go "all-in" to their preferred coin. For those of us that held both, we're shielded from this BTC vs BCH drama.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:06:15
Well, if the fork never happened then it would have been nothing to be concerned about. However, the fork did happen and everyone that had coins at the fork got a "free" airdrop. Even if Bcash is shit, it still has some value according to exchange rates, even if that value is overinflated.
I'm not saying to buy both coins, I am just saying if you got BCash for free it doesn't hurt to keep it. Putting all your eggs into one basket isn't wise.

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:09:41
It's not that much of a bias. I  mean, I don't like Bcash. But, most of us got the coins for "free". We didn't get LTC for free nor did we get Ripple, Monero, etc. The day that the fork happened, there was market value created that didn't exist before
We could sell Bcash and buy Litecoin and all the others, but Bitcoin is currently in a league of its own largely because it was the first. That's a powerful motivation that can keep it afloat for a while.. except remember that Bcash claims to be the original Bitcoin. Both can't really co-exist long term (I think) so one will eventually win in the end. I'd love to see Bitcoin win, but no one can predict the future. So, why not hedge our bets?
Would I have bought into Bitcoin Cash if I never owned some? Sure, I think. Buy 1 BTC.. buy 1 BCH. (or maybe $100 BTC and $100 BCH). Would I also buy other altcoins? Sure, I mean it's about diversification.
Active traders don't understand this and that's why they average less on ROI than those that get in and forget what they even own. Those that dumped BTC in favor of BCH probably missed out on the Bitcoin Gold fork. That fork is probably going nowhere but there are people out there willing to buy it. Those that dumped BCH in favor of BTC might miss out on any BCH fork that could happen (which would be funny). They certainly missed out on the frenzy of trading over the last few days, too.
But.. if anyone is in this for purely ideological reasons and couldn't give two craps about price, well then diversification isn't intended for them. But judging by the posts in I think most are in it for money.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:33:28
I didn't say that. But, the way I read the part I quoted was "we can still pump the price up by recruiting people in India and China!" ... almost like we're on level 12 of a multi-level marketing scheme and we want to keep the party going. Maybe you don't mean that and that's fine, but it's how I read it since it's a trending pattern of thought.
What you say is true, the price is rising because of a decreasing rate of supply inflow that tends towards zero that is going up against a sharp rise in demand. 
But, poor people in India and China can't afford to use Bitcoin. It's a fact. This price party will end if we can't actually fix the technology to get Bitcoin to the people that could benefit from it the most, not privileged westerners like myself. The rich Chinese are already in Bitcoin and I have spoken to Koreans that tell me their biggest customers are rich Chinese that fly into Seoul once a month with wads of cash. They don't have poor Indians and poor Chinese buying from them. I asked one local Korean BTC seller (from localbitcoins) why the BTC price in Korea was so high compared to other countries and on other exchanges. He told me that his customers buy to hold more so than anyone else in the world and absolutely refuse to sell for cheap prices. For a lot of poor people, their only way into the Bitcoin market is through local exchanges and these holders that demand a high price way above the actual market rate. When you have a mindset of refusing to sell coupled with high transaction fees, you can forget ever seeing poor Indians and Poor Chinese ever getting into Bitcoin.
Anyway no, Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme... but it's often promoted to look like one. If we can fix the transaction fees in a sensible way and encourage people to actually use their Bitcoins, then we might actually see poor people finally be able top get in.
Don't get me wrong though. I personally enjoy the rise in price. But, we all have to be real here.

Well, I was referring to those that got "free" coins from the fork. People on both sides dumped their BTC or BCH coins to buy up more of their favorite Bitcoin variety only to later post they regretted it. Why? Because keeping all your eggs in one basket is a bad idea. 
But something can be said about diversification. Betting on a single cryptocurrency's future is far riskier than picking stocks. If what you're doing is purely for ideological reasons and you're fine with the loss, that's fine and I support you. But if you or others are looking for financial rewards, then limiting your level of diversification isn't a smart move.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:09:47
Well, maybe I was unclear but what I meant was if you got free coins because of the fork.

I mean, that is what I am asking. You can't just move to another country without a visa or some other citizenship. In most countries you can't just get a visa to live there permanently unless you have family ties or a lot of money. OP had $4M in Bitcoin. But, I guess what I am asking is can he get a visa or citizenship just from Bitcoin alone? Or will he have to convert to fiat to place in a bank first?
I have dual citizenship myself so I know how I could do that myself, but I am curious for those that only have one citizenship.

Um, okay?


Who said I am afraid? I sleep well at night.


Did I say to actually leave the US? All I said is that there are two rational options: contact your representatives or renounce your citizenship. The IRS won't go after non-citizens/non-residents.
You do have a 3rd option and that is to stay in the US and not report your income. I assume that this is you. But if you have a lot of money that isn't reported you're taking a gamble, especially on public forum like Reddit.
Let me ask you something: have you ever wrote a letter or e-mail to those in congress that represent you to express your anger at the IRS? I have.


If you feel so strongly that the US isn't ours, then why am I the numb nuts while you also occupy this land? Unless you assume I am some immigrant? I was born and raised in the US to parents also born and raised here.

I am not saying that what the IRS is doing is right. I am just saying that as an individual you are powerless if/when they come after you
Go on to their website and read how they determine how much in income you are failing to report in an audit. One method is basically where they determine your net worth growth over the years, subtract out your reported income, and then will tax you on that difference plus fines. Like, say you reported $100K of total income in 2 years. Yet, your net-worth has grown $200K in those two years. That is an extra $100K that appeared out of nowhere that you placed in home equity, a new car, etc. Guess what? IRS slaps you with a tax bill on $100K (probably $30-$40K) plus fines if they decide not to press charges for tax evasion.
Do I like taxes? no. But, I know how the IRS operates and the only way to fight them is contacting your senators and representatives. Or, you can just renounce your citizenship and leave the US.

In leasing a car, you're basically just renting a car at a premium. That's all it is. You're better off just paying cash on a used car.

Seriously, what's to stop me from using your road on a daily basis that you pay for and I do not? I mean, obviously I use roads like that already.. I travel to another country and use their roads that I didn't pay for. But if under your system we live in close proximity what stops me from using your road and infrastructure without paying anything at all? Whether I am rich or poor I will use your road and not pay a single penny/satoshi. How does it get maintained? Are you going to keep paying for the road that I am using for free?
Or will we just privatize all the roads and put up tolls? Who will manage all that? A private company? How will competition between companies happen? What if a monopoly forms especially if Evil Corp has the only roads out of town?
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:35:36


No one said it was controlled from the beginning. It could grow organically much like they do already. Or, they could grow somewhere first as Good Corp but then muscle their way in as Evil Corp in another town that only knew peace for decades.


Well, never underestimate the stupidity of a population. Politicians know and abuse this daily.
As for Evil Corp's incentives, they could be no different than any other evil individual or group that has existed throughout history.  The incentive can just be pure control.  They may put polices into place that I am powerless to fight, even by moving or trying to form a "competing" entity that they would just destroy by force. They become the de facto government that I have to submit to for my daily ass raping.

Anyway car ownership needs will depend on the circumstances. When I lived in South Korea, I didn't own a car because public transportation is just awesome. Where i live now, I am a fool if I do not own a car. I choose one that is used and doesn't depreciate much. Repairs aren't all that expensive (or often) too.

Because mining is almost always about quick profits. They (well we as I mine alts) just mine whatever makes the most money and have to be quick to jump ship because margins can be tight. Some will stick to one chain, but I can appreciate why many would alternate. Many don't care all that much if they are hurting Bitcoin because in the end it's just about getting the highest ROI after paying their bills. If they see Bitcoin about to collapse because of their collective actions, they may just sell the equipment and mine some other coin.
I mine Zcash, but I am not opposed to moving to something else like ZClassic for a day, week, or month if I can make more money.
But, I can also appreciate the pain users feel. When I send Bitcoin, I hate spending $5 in fees and waiting 4 hours for one confirmation to make a $50 payment/donation to someone.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:28:41

Intrinsic value (inherent), potential value (speculation), or market value (economic)? The current price factors in all of that, but the question is how much is speculation?

Among emotional investors, It's like that no matter what market it is. They panic at the slightest dip and sell everything, are skeptical of future rises in price, and buy only on all-time-highs when FOMO sets in.They are negative because they produce the conditions for negativity by harming themselves no matter if it's the crypto market, housing market, or stock market.

Supply and demand could maybe be regulated with raising the prices, but gamers likely won't pay the increased price at all. Many gamers don't have cash to throw around like a lot of people in crypto might have.
Edit: not sure why this was downvoted. People seem to forget the GPU manufacturers are in business to cater to gamers, not miners. They could raise the prices, and some stores have done it for them (the Fry's near where I live is charging 950+ for GPUs, New Egg is charging &gt;1,000 for some cards). But, their main long-term customers, the gamers, will complain about "price gouging."

I was mining ZCash for months.. maybe 6 months. It was on average one of the most profitable coins. Now I switched over to NiceHash (later might go to AwesomeMiner) and my profits have been slightly better. A lot of the kids I saw months ago in Micro Center buying cards only knew about Ethereum. If I said "ZCash" they'd be like "wut" even though it was more profitable to mine.

About $30 per day on average.. so $900 per month. But ZCash is also down. Mining sucks ATM because the mining market got oversaturated right before the declining prices we have now... so we have too many miners and crappy crypto prices.
Weak hands will leave, which will raise profits again.
In the meantime, it might make more sense to resell GPUs.

I have 4 1070s and 4 1080Tis. When I started, I was pulling ~$500 per month. At the peak, it went up to $1,500 per month. If you want to know about electricity, my rig consumes close to $120 per month in electricity.
When I did the math on Ethereum, I would have made half that.

Probably few miners are spending their crypto now while they wait for its value to increase. If I spend 1 BTC/BCH on mining equipment now and the value of BTC/BCH goes up, well then I effectively overpaid. As a miner myself, I don't think it's a smart move to spend the coins I currently have. If I acquired some coins priced at X, then why spend that when they go for only X/2? Better to hold and wait. Miners that have fiat on hand because they liquidated BTC/BCH at higher prices can save the crypto they have.
Smart miners have both crypto and fiat on hand. Personally, I've always saved 20% of my crypto and liquidated the remaining 80%. After all, I've got to pay the bills and buy groceries.

Resellers do add value if the act of reselling improves upon the efficiency of getting the product to those that couldn't normally get it without expending their own resources beyond what the buyer considers optimal. However, in a lot of cases "resellers" (AKA scalpers) just capitalize on missed pricing opportunities that would have been optimal in a supply/demand economy.

Neither is "better" since that's subjective. The point is to dispell the myth that you must buy one whole Bitcoin. I have a t-shirt that says this and you'd be amazed at how many people throughout the day say to me "wow are you serious?" Because they think you must buy a whole Bitcoin.
Saying you can buy $10 worth is nice, but you're pegging BTC to the US dollar by saying so. And besides, I think buying $10 worth is mostly worthless since you can't do much of anything with that low amount. Between marginal markups and TX fees, you would have to spend probably $20 to get $10 worth.
Personally, I'd say the minimum barrier to entry to BTC is $100.

True. With my fiat, I typically invest 50% of my income in things that have a long track record (&gt; 30 years) of making money. When prices drop, I keep that strategy but I also pull money out of reserves that I had stashed in a savings account for opportunities like this and throw more money into those investments.
A bit harder to do that with crypto because people that don't even plan for their retirement are buying crypto.. and when you're hairdresser is buying crypto and couldn't tell you the difference between the S&amp;P 500 and the Indy 500, we've got problems.

Understanding the fundamentals of any market makes you better informed as to WHY anyone buys and sells the thing you're trading. There are plenty of speculators driving prices up and down constantly, but long-term trends are driven by actual utility. The deeper you understand the utility, the better you can predict these trends. More information can only help, not hurt.

Korean law enforcement often set up sting operations to arrest foreigners with E2 visas that try to make extra money tutoring. Basically going after guys trying to make an extra 100,000 KRW a week for doing a job that their visa doesn't allow them to do. So, I wouldn't put it past the Korean gov't to go after foreigners buying/selling crypto through Korean exchanges with Korean bank accounts. I think I'll pass on testing this one.

Traders don't consider the technological aspects and motivations that drive Bitcoin. Instead, they are too busy drawing meaningless lines and triangles to predict runup and rundowns through their oversimplifications. They can't tell you what a public key is and how it corresponds with a private key, but they sure as hell can draw some lines on market charts and in 30 seconds tell you to buy or sell.
As a miner myself, I've typically hold 20% of what I mine. I sell the raining 80% to pay bills and justify to the Mrs. that what I am doing is working.
Right now my profitability isn't as great so I am selling nearly 100%. I'm hoping to scale up soon so that I can get back to only selling 80% and saving 20%.

Probably. However, say all the wallets are fixed and 10,000 transactions happen in the next 10 minutes include a fee 20% higher than the fee suggested right now. All 10,000 would get priority and added to the next block? The backlog we have now will take 5 hours to clear assuming no new transactions are made... but there will be more added. So anyone that sent a transaction 4 hours ago with (what used to be) a priority fee may now be considered "normal" or "economy" because all the new transactions are coming in with higher fees to beat the backlog.
Please correct me if I misunderstand this.

I lived there for 3 years. Whenever students said they were from "Korea" I asked "Korea? North Korea? You're a spy?" All joking and the students loved it, but my point was "Korea" is the peninsula, not the country (anymore at least). When North Korea says "Korea", they mean the ENTIRE peninsula where Seoul is just a large city and Pyongyang is the capital.
I've visited North Korea 5 years ago and in their books they consider North and South as one country and refer to South Korea as "south Korea" (notice the lower-case "s" in south).
