It is only fair to come back to this post and report that the issue has now been completely resolved. 
Coinbase contacted me after this post and appears to have driven the issue to resolution. Ultimately someone at Expedia had to issue the refund and it appears that it took Coinbase bringing it to the attention of the appropriate person (at Expedia) to have it completed.
I got my bitcoin back April 1st, so resolution was 30 days. Much of this was waiting for responses from Expedia. It took me a total of 2 phone calls to Expedia lasting a total of 2:15 and 10-15 emails exchanged, plus this post to reach this resolution.

Hello coinbase-john and thanks for taking a look into this.  Your message is the first where either side has taken  ownership of the issue since this happened three weeks ago. 
I agree that coinbase support has responded promptly to email although the result has always been a push back to Expedia's consumer support,  which clearly is not set up to talk about bitcoin transactions or to even escalate to those who are. 
The series of events really highlights some of the advantages that consumer credit card law offers (at least in the US) such as the right to correct billing and prompt resolutions of errors. Hopefully the bitcoin payments industry can police itself effectively enough to prevent that kind of regulatory attention. 
Looking forward to a resolution.

I agree it creates a bad rep for the entire eco-system, and if I am Coinbase I am particularly interested in making this go very, very smoothly for everyone involved. But now I am not like to try this again and certainly wouldn't recommend anyone else to try.
Expedia reported $0.75 billion net income on $6.6 billion revenue for 2015. That might be tight but definitely not an excuse for unjust enrichment due to incompetence :(

It is on the blockchain and I have shown it to both Expedia and Coinbase. I agree there should be no dispute about a refund being due immediately. Amazingly, it is impossible to reach anyone on either side who will take ownership and make it happen.

Coinbase found the transaction on their side and acknowledged it went through for Expedia - then they asked me to email that data to Expedia's support for help.

Yes - 100% positive. There is no booking, therefore no place to go to request a refund. If you know where else to look, I'm all ears.
I have tried to get escalated on each call to Expedia, but there is no booking, they can't see any payment, and they run out of options. Each time the result has been to push me back to Coinbase. 
The reason I have tried email several times is that Coinbase keeps pushing me towards email instead of the Expedia call center.

Sorry this is happening to you,  I can relate (see my post history). Hopefully is gets fixed quickly and painlessly.  
These aren't the kinds of stories that need to be coming out around bitcoin anymore,  it keeps newbies away and pushes adoption back. 
Isn't this the kind of thing that federal banking regulation is designed to help protect consumers against? Only if you were working with a bank of course. All bitcoin businesses,  coinbase included,  should take a long hard look at how much regulation they want slowing them down in the future and work to prove they don't need it by actually taking good care of their customers.

Well, to be fair - I was on Expedia.com trying to do business with Expedia. I don't particularly care who their payment processor is nor should it really matter (to the consumer).  
If your Visa credit card payment failed, it would be reasonable to start with the merchant first, right? 
So I suppose that I do expect Expedia to at least have some interest in owning the problem to resolution.

This is a good demonstration of how emotional investing is - everyone wants in when the price is $260. No one wants in when the price is $70. 
Turns out the best time to buy is usually when no one else wants it.

They said it uses the cash scanner hardware found in gambling slot machines and can be localized for nearly any currency. As I was standing there many people came by and used it as its fully operational.
The company is trying to sell the machines to people who want to set them up and earn a commission.

MtGox didn't show up to the conference (although they did pay for Wifi in everyone's rooms). Vessenes wouldn't comment on the lawsuit.

Thanks for posting this

Why would that be? All they could do is send you coins - Btc addresses are meant to be public.

I think one could argue that's a convenience fee for running the machine and securing a location for it on an otherwise low friction,  free transaction.  Same as mtgox charging an exchange fee,  right?

I am flying in tomorrow morning, staying at the Hilton. Would enjoy meeting up with anyone!
