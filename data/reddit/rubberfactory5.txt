Any idea what caused this?
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:23:31
Holy shit are you serious

Should I wait for another dip (it’s kinda gone back up) to buy or should I buy now
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:52:11
Seems sketchy.
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:36:43
Y u say dis
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:33:44
You speak with such certainty that it’s going to explode... no one knows
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:38:14
Aren’t there fees on there?
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:05:02
You’re amazing thanks
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:49:58
Can you sell from there too?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:32:49
Buy now or wait for drop?
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:31:12
It won’t let me buy or transfer funds to Coinbase Pro ? Where does it say you can buy at all without depositing funds?
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:09:36
Bit new.  What’s that?
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:57:37
What’s the difference from normal Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:22:19
Doesn’t cash app own the bitcoin ? How bad are the fees? Can I sell from there?
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:47:30
Hey I know this thread just died but is the only danger that Robinhood could be hacked? 
Otherwise, what place is a safe place to actually exchange my cash for bitcoin? And what wallet do you recommend? I’m a student and new at this sadly
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:31:25
Interesting. I have a tiny bit of bitcoin on a Coinbase account, but I think you guys are referring to GDAX? Is that what takes a bunch of time to set up? Coinbase was pretty quick. I know they own them but Coinbases fees are terrible
@_date: 2019-06-19 07:50:26
Completely new here. Student, actually. I’m sure you guys get this a lot but what’s a safe way to buy bitcoin with PayPal/Debit?
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:48:42
I’m being annoying at this point but you’re referring to something other than the mainstream Coinbase, right? Some pro version?
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:12:38
Thanks for the responses. Do they have a mobile app? 
Most importantly, can I literally just buy and sell them on that platform? Do I need a separate wallet for the bitcoin I buy on Coinbase Pro ?

When do y’all think it’ll stop
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:25:18
Your /u is foolish fool so I’m just wondering how you know it’ll climb more
