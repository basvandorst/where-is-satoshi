Would anyone be so kind as to show how to do this? Or at least point us people in the direction of a guide of some sort?

Hmm.. I went to Coinbase and I was already logged in, there was no prompt for any token. Maybe just a glitch from all the extra traffic they've been getting.

...which is exactly what I did. There isn't an option to buy without checking the box.

So when I bought from them before, the price was going up, I paid for 0.5 BTC, and received 0.357 BTC 5 days later, which was fine because it was equal in USD to the amount I had paid 5 days ago. This time, when the price went down, I still received the same amount of BTC, which netted a gain of almost 50 USD for Coinbase.

I've e-mailed them and PMed the user account here on Reddit. I'll send them another e-mail tonight if I don't hear anything. 
Seriously I was trying to figure out if I was a complete idiot or something. I may not be a bitcoin wizard but I can read a fucking disclaimer.

"you will receive the market price of bitcoin on ________, _____ PDT after your funds have arrived".
Is that what it says, or no? 
OHHHHH I see how it is, if the price goes up, then coinbase will give you the market price on the day they pay you, but if it does DOWN then they get to keep all the extra money that I sent. Pretty sweet deal.

It would be nice if it went down over the weekend because I don't get my BTC from coinbase until Monday from the order I submitted on last Monday.

Thank you!

cash deposit on bitinstant is still showing up for me??
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:40:09
I'm in Germany, I checked bitinstant and there isn't an option for moneygram/cash drop for BTC unfortunately.

When I bought it said that they had "exceeded their buy limits for the day. If you would still like to purchase blah blah blah". I tried doing that 5 times at various times of the day over the course of 2 days and I got this message


My order would only go through if I had the box checked


which I did

It specifically says that you will receive the market price of BTC on the day that your funds are awarded. I checked the box that said "I acknowledge that the amount of BTC I receive will vary based on future exchange rates."
