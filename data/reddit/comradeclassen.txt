I also bought a plane ticket from cheap air with relative ease. I did have to switch my flight for unseen personal reasons, and since I missed the 24hr deadline to switch the flight, I had to pay to reschedule. THAT flight was not able to be paid with Bitcoin, but that was mainly my fault. 
Speedy transactions FTW.

Damn man, I'm sorry to hear about that. I really hope something turns around and you get your money back. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:38:44
Damn, I might actually take the next train ride for this.

Ahhh okay I see. I believe I was confusing them for the little emoticons that people send to each other.

Pardon my asking, but what can I use the for. The answer seems to be staring me in the face but I am lacking common sense right now.

I am commenting here again to say that I have not received any of the paintings. I have sent two emails WHEN there was a support page, and now, nada. You can't even sign in anymore to send anyone anything.

I bought all 3.

This. Once I am able to book an international flight to Colombia with Bitcoins, I'll be a genuinely happy man.

I'm having a bit of difficulty sending money overseas. My family simply does not know what to do with the Bitcoins and are reluctant to give out their bank information.

Release the Kraken.

This. There seems to be a fee every time I want to move some of my money around. Main reason I jumped into Bitcoin.

This definitely gave me a new perspective on the future, one that seems inevitable. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:10:53
Well yesterday's was on C-Span3, so I'm hoping it is the same.

I read here awhile back when they said that Bitcoin will be the high roller cash. We'd used other crypto-currencies for the smaller stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:44:20
I also organize my money with Mint.com, and it actually shows me how much I spend in fees. $36 in two months?? PPsshhtt!!!

About to bust out the banjo to busk for bitcoin.

Colombia. They recently opened up a Bitcoin Exchange over there, but I am ultimately looking for a way for them to easily exchange the Bitcoins into Pesos without having to meet up with anyone or put they're banking information through a computer in an internet cafe (The only way they get internet.)

Awesome article. I actually fantasized some populist, preaching the juicy details of this article, on the 5th on November, in a nation address to everyone. Douba-Awesome. 
This was the journal they were talking about.

Price just dropped down to $920 on Coinbase.

That's a lot of money being saved if you are a video game nut. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:09:42
shiiiiiiit, I'm getting ready to stock up, $850!

Soooo many pretty links!

Hmmmm... Help me understand this a bit more, if you don't mind.
