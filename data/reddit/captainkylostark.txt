Listen, nothing can Chinese Economy like Bitcoin. 
The great thing about Chinese Economy is how versatile it is. Not only can Bitcoin Chinese Economy, but so do I. I Chinese Economy myself every month or so along with the whole family. Tomorrow, I'm going to Chinese Economy with some friends.

i'm going to sell probably by end of day today, then later purchase a more diversified portfolio of alt-coins. i've double my BTC investment, and although it's not a lot, i'm happy with that. i see more potential for long term growth in alt's than with BTC at the moment.
