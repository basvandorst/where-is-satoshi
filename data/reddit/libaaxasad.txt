Actually, there are already couple of bitcoin startups in Somalia. I, Somalia,  am software architect and currently  developing a bitcoin wallet service.  Yes, it has a different bitpesa business model and bigger features than bitpesa.  if you need help, let me know your contact info and  I would share my consulting site with you.

Even though , there are still some Somali shillings in circulation, the defacto local currency in Somalia  is the USD.  The remittance money is a larger portion of the country's current GDP and it comes to the country as a USD through Somalia money transfer services.  Somalia is also a cash-less society and  all the daily transactions are done through digital money, eg  mobile money. There are 4 or 6 different mobile  money companies.


Yes, Somalia has one of the best mobile and internet infrastructure  than most of the African countries.  Two days ago, I had a flawless video conference with my family in Somalia from Canada.   A month before that, I couldn't  have a good voice communication using whatisup/viper   with my friends in Kenya and Uganda. I also call Somalia for free. 


Yes, that could  work parallel with the current mobile  money services, but bitcoin prices fluctuation would still effect the bottom line since the remittance money is in USD. Also don't forget that the services and products in Somalia  are priced in USD.
yes, I am working on a bitcoin wallet services for Somalia/Africa and trying to bring Somalia investors on board.
