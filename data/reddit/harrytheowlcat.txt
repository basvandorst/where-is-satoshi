Did you read my comment? How do you know they weren't made by hand?

You've got to be kidding. What building specifically are you referring to? What building from the past could we not replicate? What, the pyramids?
Do you think the ancient Egyptians could have built the Burj Khalifa? We've clearly surpassed ancient people's building capacity. 
Did you know that on earth, you can start at the North pole, travel 90° south to the equator, turn 90° west and travel say from 0°W to 90°W, make a 90° turn due North and end up back at the pole?
The path you've traced is a triangle with 3 90° angles. 
This is not the only line of evidence available. What specifically makes you "not certain" that the Earth is a globe?

You don't own your crypto on robinhood, if that matters

Then to back up a bit, what specifically makes you question the globular nature of the Earth? Do you make up your own conclusions from limited knowledge just as you have here?

Didn't I call you irredeemably stupid earlier? Or are you just now catching on that I find you subhumanly unintelligent?

I looked Pumapunku up and there's nothing to suggest that they had "laser beam shooting gadgets" or anything else. In fact, they seemed to use normal hand tools to slowly shape the stones. But that's speculation. 
Why does "I don't know" immediately, to you, imply they had advanced electronics like lasers? Even when there is no evidence of infrastructure able to support such technology?
If we died out and aliens visited, it would be clear that we had electronics. With no evidence of electronics, why are you assuming that they had it 1500 years ago?
Also, there is no evidence that we could not replicate their processes just as they did it in the modern era. We just have different and far more advanced methods for stonework now than 1500 years ago. 
I don't see why you're making these bold assumptions with so little evidence.

It's probably the passing light that came on accidentally 
Here's an example of older cars using it:
Couldn't find a newer example but GT3 cars use flashing lights to warn slower cars that they're behind and passing.

Stonehenge is beyond our technology? Since fucking when? Have you ever walked on a sidewalk, perhaps? Massive fucking stone that we just lay all the fuck over the place?
And Machu Pichu? Why do you think we couldn't replicate these?
And no, you can't do a 270° triangle on a flat plane, that's literally impossible. 
NASA does not have a trillion dollar budget....
To be honest, you're too far gone. I can't save you from your own stupidity at this point.

Sorry I'm on mobile. CO2 is the primary driver of climate change at this stage. As CO2 starts a domino effect of sorts, other factors may come into play more heavily (such as water vapor). But as of right now, the main concern is CO2 driving global temperatures up.
@_date: 2019-07-18 04:25:32
Perhaps not

The thought that "climate changes all the time" is highly misleading. Say you're in your room, just chillin, and then suddenly it just starts getting hotter and hotter. So you shout to your friend, "hey is it getting hotter in here or something?" And they reply, "the temperature changes all the time it's no big deal".
The temperature is increasing at unprecedented rates. While earth's temperature does fluctuate, major changes of this scale could take tens of thousands of years to happen, not decades (ie it is happening over 1000x faster right now).
"It might even be good"
Absolutely not, not for any life on earth (except for perhaps rich people). Let's start with some basics - you know that higher temperature means more energy, right? So what happens when the ocean is hotter, has higher energy, and uses that higher energy for stronger storms? You get... Stronger storms. As we've seen in the past couple years, there is no shortage of high power storms, abnormal flooding in the Midwest, etc. Puerto Rico was left without power for quite some time and if I recall the death toll was in the thousands. 
With higher temperatures also comes worse heatwaves and drouts. California recently was in a bad drought; a heatwave in central Europe ended with thousands dead (elderly and children mostly). 
Higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere also means the ocean is absorbing more of it leading to ocean acidification, which coral reefs (some of the most active and biodiverse regions on earth, which millions of organisms rely on) are highly sensitive to. 
Rising sea levels from the ocean expanding (you know hot things expand, water is no different) threaten coastal communities globally. 
"Cooling trends"
Nobody says there are cooling trends. The myth that cooling was accepted in the 70s/80s/whenever is just that, a myth. The vast majority of papers have found very strong warming patterns for the last 100+ years the phenomenon has been known about. 
I visited climatedepot and it looks like some dumb shit, gotta be honest. I highly recommend potholer54 on YouTube if you want some very high quality, scientific rundowns of climate change.

It's because modern conservatism is authoritarian. They restrict freedoms moreso than practically anyone else as far as I've seen.

Look up "Chernobyl New Containment"
Think the ancient people could build that?
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:54:58
What specifically do you think is not happening? Why do you assume that the government is my source?
The average temperature of the earth has seen a significant rise in recent decades. Do you dispute this?
The cause of the temperature rise is closely associated with rising carbon dioxide emissions, and the type of CO2 that is emitted from human sources is gaining prevalence in the atmosphere. This establishes a link between human activity and carbon dioxide levels, thus climate change. 
Do you understand different forcing factors such as the sun, reflectivity, carbon absorption, etc? 
You're going against a lot of science, and you'll never win this fight.

Don't people's hands get stronger from practice?
Do people not learn from mistakes in your world?
