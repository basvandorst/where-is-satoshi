Oh, they realize.

Most viewers don't give a shit. They'd probably change the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:25:00
How many people do you interact with on a daily basis?
Try cold-approaching people on the street. Ask them if they've heard what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:30:52
If there was a backdoor, they would have used it by now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:29:26
maybe you're not hanging out with the "average person"
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:53:37
No one controls it. That's the entire point of decentralization.

Coinbase is a bank.

They don't want people taking their money out of Marrill Lynch's hands. Putting it into bitcoin gives them no power to exploit you and your money.

Do you understand how expensive body guard are?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:33:37
What happens if BTC goes backwards?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:59
I'm sure they're very concerned about the law. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:52:22
lmao, i wish i had that much... I just see it go down ~$74 and I still freak for a minute, but then realize that i'm still in the positive.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:06

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:52:38


@_date: 2017-12-05 10:02:30
Nope, bitcoin is dead. I'll properly dispose of yours for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:39:19
dude, read a fucking book
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:49:04
Wow, the reverse trolling is real. 
Stfu asshole. No one cares about you. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:23:25
Numbers are hard, man. I work with them all day and I still get confused. 
Just imagine outside our bitcoin bubble (pun intended), the number of people that don't give a shit about numbers.

If it wasn't safe, then political activists wouldn't be using it to overthrow tyrannical governments.

You aren't learning, are you?
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:18:06

This is a social revolution. We must help our brothers and sisters with it.

Bitcoin isn't a stock. Don't call it shares. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:15:31
Forget about it, man. BTC is too hard for people to grasp to begin with. There's no way a bunch of ignorant people are going to use this temporary denotation.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:00:18
The scammers timed their FUD with the correction.

About 90% of my business student friends say it's a scam. A good chunk of them also don't believe that gold has any practical use.

How did you extrapolate from the OP that he was suggesting that paper wallets were better than hardware?

You are your own bank now. You lose your password, you lose the key to your bank. 
Tough luck, kid.
