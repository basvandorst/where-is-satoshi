Buffett probably views it as a zero-sum game between the crypto market and the stock market.
It's the same as how BTC holders try to convince people not to put their money into altcoins.
The US stock market was worth $30T in January.  Crypto's $800B valuation in January reached 2.6% the value of the stock market.
People who have most of their wealth in stocks want the younger generations to keep buying their bags instead of diverting that money into crypto.

Yeah, it's some of the best news in Bitcoin's history.
The Chairman of the NYSE and his wife have an incentive to help grow the market for Bitcoin.
These are some of the most powerful people in finance who have a track record of big wins.
"Not your physical bullion, not your gold" is also true.  The first gold ETF still brought in a shitload of new money that benefited all the physical bullion holders.

Regular people aren't the ones holding $21T in the offshore banking system.
Former offshore banking safe-havens like Switzerland are now freezing billions of $ each year:
If only 1% of that wealth needs to use crypto as a hedge against getting frozen by a bank, that's already $210B.
Now add other use-cases, like regular people using crypto as an alternative to gambling in casinos and lotteries, and it's obvious that crypto is undervalued.
