Can't swing a cat without hitting an expert with a crystal ball around crypto...Yawn.

Really nice piece. Captured a lot of the euphoria if the moment.

The question was more about the future electricity needs of bitcoin rather than where it may come from. Will the need just continue to grow?
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:52:48
Is there any way to reduce the electricity usage going forward. Otherwise a successful bitcoin will cause it's own downfall through crazy electricity usage needs.... Regardless of price.

Wow. If anyone believes this pile of crap then they will be easily fooled into buying some new creation on  BCH. 
Maybe it's like the Nigerian prince scam. Written poorly on purpose to filter people down to the most gullible?
Having said that there are many many people in the world who believe all sorts of bull from chemtrails to Christianity. So, someone will bite.

The three IFs in that post are the most important words in it. Do not borrow to gamble.

You would buy a good lock for a bike worth say €1000 right? .... So do the same with your coins. Get them offline away from what lurks there.

Cryptoscam is good. Crypto world news too.

Nice plate

 The current wisdom is to purchase small amounts every day or week to average over the bumps. That saves you from buying all at an elevated price.

Nobody knows if you are late or early to the party.... Just cross your fingers and hold on to the rails...

And 100% of baby boomers don't trust banks either.  Once they have a choice, and trust blockchain, It's game over.
But right now we still need a stable savings vehicle like bonds and fiat.
Crypto is a playground.

Hi. Just wondering if you made an investment and hows it going?
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:35:42
Mate, your last two comments give me the impression that you may not be ready. The price can , and has plummeted many times. The Problem is that your can't know if it's about to correct or continue to slide at any minute of the day. Timing it is pure luck.
Placing a stop sell on an exchange means keeping funds on the exchange which is risky given the wild West we are in right now.
You need to be ready to be in the negative for long periods and Lose all your 5k...Are you?

Where there is money there will always be deceit- regardless of the currency vehicle... From shells to crypto.

Flipped and got stellar. Best call ever.

The year 2020!!

Yes. Maybe be slightly less people trading at the weekend. Seems like you are most likely to see huge drops on Mondays.

Will banks use bitcoin to transfer funds? They'll use XRP or their own version of that rather than buy bitcoin for this. No?
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:31:23
I did have base reasons at the start. Now I like the feeling of being on the edge of something new. It's like a chance to be around when they built the railroads.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:06:23
... Sigh... Good luck with that.

Question: if a bitcoin ETF is created, then investors will not need to buy bitcoin. They will be more likely to trade the ETF version instead?

OP... Perhaps you could remind yourself that you went to the classes to learn, not to teach. Are you sure this person can't teach you anything?
If so, try listening... If not, then the door its right there.

Needs a line where volatility reduces or the widespread store of value can't happen. "Would you put your pension in it?" level of certainty.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:51:33
Thanks. I missed those lines.
Mea culpa.
But they need to be before greater adoption.
Also, by comparison to bitcoin, gold is a stable Rock :-)
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:23:00
Yes. Sounds like moving their existing processes to " the blockchain"(definitive article?). Perhaps they could combine it with their IoT project and AI to fully leverage the bleeding edge tech...

Seasonality ?!  Bitcoin prices are nowhere near stable enough for talk of seasonality yet.

Pattern recognition in humans is a great asset in recognising Tigers in the jungle. But a major source of faulty reasoning in stock markets.
