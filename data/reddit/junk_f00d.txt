Today I sent some Bitcoin Cash from Binance to a Bitcoin address on coinegg, is there any chance that this might be redeemable?

Are Bitcoin futures cancelled? Can't find a source on this but it's the rumor.

Anyone here agree with bigger blocks as a short term solution being perfectly fine? I have not heard an argument for why it's a bad thing, short term.

Yeah, apparently better than you do. As an example, do you not understand the potential reprecussions from the inability to scale immediately? Bad software decisions can kill the chain and we've the effects of this recently, moron. There are many more potential examples, but you're going to have to use your own brain for that, it'll probably be a good exercise for you.

So I assume you realized you were retarded since you didn't reply?

So it's not cancelled? Saying "no" would've been a nice tl;dr

Gold doesn't fork every other month. Gold is thousands of years old and has a track record of stability. Gold can't be destroyed by a bad software decision. 
Don't get delusional m8. Gold is excellent for stability, BTC for volatility.

I think so, for better or worse. Institutional money is moving in soon.

Wow this place is a shithole

Any given day in 2009-2011 would be ideal.

Solid OP. 
However, I have a couple questions (am noob) and felt creating a thread would be overkill.
1) How will bitcoin address the scaling issue? Not here to shill but IOTA has a neat concept (tangle vs blockchain) regarding scaling: 
2) How will bitcoin combat it's centralization around ASIC miners? I think Vertcoin's lack of FPGA / ASIC mining capabilities is something closer to ideal here, as it decentralizes the control a bit, in theory at least.
3) I think implementing some privacy centric features, like that of XMR, could benefit as well.
4) The ledger is huge and growing until the last block is mined. Is this going to be addressed?
Is it possible to have all these technologies on a single coin? Is there any activity towards addressing these concerns?

Well, the issue in my mind is that it does not cap out. If, hypothetically, bitcoin reaches it's desired position in the world as a widely used currency, that's a whole lot of memory it'd be eating up. Of course, there are brute force solutions via hardware upgrades and another user mentioned Lightning Network - which was implied by another user in response to my question to be a solid fix for the smaller (and much more numerous) transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:19:02
Basically the same question, yes, but I though it necassary to divide them as they provide different aspects of the multifauceted scaling problem. One might be more likely to, in response, then offer only a portion of the complete solution I am seeking had I not expanded. 
Anyhow, would you mind sharing some of these proposed solutions you know of?
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:27:12
Thank you for the responses, the only remaining questions I have concern 3 and 4. Regarding 4) The blockchain size is over 100GB now and constantly growing, likely growing at a faster rate than previously since Bitcoin is gaining traction, and more transactions occur now than ever before (I assume) - I'm just wondering what kind of solutions are on the horizon. 
And as for number 3, you mentioned "mopst of the privacy stuff decreases scalability", do you know of exceptions to this?
