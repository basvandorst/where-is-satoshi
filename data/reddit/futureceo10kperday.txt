Here to vouch for **Shakepay**, they have great sentiments;
It essentially acts as a wallet where you can also fund accounts like Coinbase. Low fees and accepts etransfer and wires. I've only ever etransfered and it's pretty quick, although not instant like when using interac online. If you search on [you will see a lot of people have been using Shakepay now!
If you decide using Shakepay use my referal and we both get 5$! r/[

Shakepay has no mining fee for transfers out so i would suggest moving it, don't want it to go down one day for maintenance like CIBC on friday
