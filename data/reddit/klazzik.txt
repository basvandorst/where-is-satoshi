Yep exactly, this means that Bitcoin is still in it's adoption phase, more and more people are starting to learn about it.

Googlebot is just a spider which crawls web pages to index them on Google. Even if your profile's link was seen by Google, it wouldn't attempt to login to your profile, it would only load the page with no username/password inputs.
It most likely is an automated software which tries to login to random profiles using random passwords.

Half of the subreddits listed are dogecoin related. You might as well want to make doge it's own 'collection' :)
Not but seriously, this list needs to be refined with a lot more subreddits added.

Yeah and 99.9% of the merchants NEED to convert to cash in order to survive. It's impossible to keep a business running on BTC only, at least for me.

I'd be more than happy to discuss this with you or anyone who's interested.
I believe we could either start from scratch or modify the non-working plugins and make them work (if they come with an open source license).

We currently process orders manually (for AdFountain.com), since we issue a small amount of orders with a big value for each order. This is ok since it doesn't require a lot of work.
I've checked open card plugins, I believe you're referring to those: 
I'm going to try those, so thanks!
However, I wouldn't rely on these since it would be a hard task to manually move payments to an exchange and sell them. We would have to do this a lot, considering the current price volatility. We have actually lost a lot of money by keeping bitcoins in our Wallet without cashing them ASAP.

What I meant is, Doge was launched in December 2013, it didn't exist 1 year ago.

There are plenty of cryptocurrency-related subreddits, but as a start you could check coinmarketcap.com for a list of all cryptocurrencies and look them up on reddit.
It would be awesome if there was a way that advertisers could select the subreddits they wanted to advertise at, just like the reddit ads engine.
Ever considered running your own ad engine for reddit, offering multiple banner placements, with a simple bidding system?

Dogecoin didn't even exist a year ago. So I guess it's searches increased by 999,999,999%.
Edit: your got all your numbers wrong, but I'm not going to correct you since this isn't the right place to do so.

Yeah Zee/Zed would be totally fine.

1. When I mentioned 'Translation' I didn't mean translation for the website. I meant, translating the documents (bank statement, bills, etc) which are required for verifying our account on any of the payment processors.
2. Keeping 100% of funds in BTC is really risky, considering Bitcoin's price volatility. It just moves really quick and with that being said, we would have to convert the funds really fast to avoid losing money.
I also have to mention that we've already lost a lot of money holding BTC in the last couple of months. (We processed orders at $800/BTC and cashed them out at $600, would have lost even more if we kept them till this day!).

Zib means Penis in Arabic.

It can be done using either:
1. Electrum Master Public Key (keeping payments 100% in BTC).
2. Exchange API. Eg: Coinbase (to convert payments to USD once received).
Both options will be available. No addresses will be stored on the server.

There's no problem with Facebook and bitcoin, I'm currently running Bitcoin-related campaigns on Facebook with no problems at all.

Google Trends and Google Keyword Planner are two different tools.
Google Trends basically shows the number of searches that have been done for a particular keyword, relative to the number of Google searches done over time.
Google Keyword Planner shows the number of searches a keyword has received in a particular month or a period of time.
So in short, trends is more about "interest" than it is about raw search volumes.

Are you kidding me? It's impossible to receive all payments to 'an address'. How would I track payments?
