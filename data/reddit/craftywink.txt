ooh. Not sure ill check next time. One of the reasons i havent tried that is because it states dont send money from an exchange, for risk of funds being delayed/lost. Is that just scaremongering?

having looked a little bit, my bitpay wallet has a seed phrase etc and is non custodial, so im ok in that regard right?

Wow thank you, i will have some reading to do today! I didnt have any idea about no fees for using same wallet etc. Its a lot more complicated that i ever imagined.

Morning everyone. Ive been using bitcoin to buy things for a while now but im assuming i'm making it more complicated than i need to. What i do at the moment is buy on coinbase, then move to bitpay then send to whoever. The things im guessing could be streamlined are the initial buying from coinbase. For example, i know i need the equivalent of $7. When i buy it from coinbase i find it confusing as to the amount to buy, as if i buy $7 i'll receive less than $7. Then i'll lose a little bit by moving to my wallet.
Is there a smoother way to do all this? Thank you.

So i should be keeping more than i need, as opposed to buying the amount i need each month. That makes sense. My wallet is bitpay at the moment. I'm sending money for debrid and or iptv etc if that helps. Thank you for the info ill go check those out.

Would i be able to send from coinbase and have it buy the required amount and send in one go?

Ah right, that makes sense. Sad it’s this way, but I get it. Thank you.

I’m wondering why/ how he’d be targeted? I mean, it’s his private wallet what can somebody even do?

this is what i didnt get. People are saying to her that, basically, shes not going to find what she wants and explaining bitcoin to her. But its like she's got her fingers in her ears going "lalalalalalalalalala"
