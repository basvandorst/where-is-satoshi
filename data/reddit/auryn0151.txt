He is being mocked because first he mis-characterizes ancap view on ownership, and then asserts that possession/ownership comes from the state, hence "shit statists say" in this example. Ownership does not come from the state, unless you would accept a law that says "rape doesn't exist because the state does not grant people ownership of their bodies," or something to that effect. 


That is also not what ancaps believe, at all. The entire point of the ideology is to organize society such that it can defend itself against bad actors, WITHOUT compulsory/coercive government services funded via taxation.

The government didn't DO anything to own the land. It just says it does, and backs it with violence. An AnCap society would recognize homesteading a legitimate claim to land. Land no one homsteads is open to use. Government land that lays dormant is not open to use without fee, even if you can get it. Property tax itself is unethical.

Who is we? How did we grant this power? Were you asked for your permission to allow the government to have this power? Do you voluntarily fund the government's ability to have this power? (Your answer to this question should not mention the social contract)


Can YOU give yourself or your neighbor the RIGHT to use violence against someone else? No, you can't. How then, can people give this power to government?


Sounds like a mafia or protection racket. If we pay them and do what they say, they won't use violence against us. Doesn't sound like they are really there to protect us.


Every government is corrupt because it uses force to take property from citizens, and dish it out. It is the perfect place for sociopaths and the power hungry to go to get the most amount of power and resources, for the smallest amount of work. COULD government be comprised completely of selfless individuals? Sure. Has it ever happened? I'm going to go with no. ALL governments misuse their power and resources (which they steal) to the detriment of the citizens who they are supposed to help. Government has shown itself time and time again to be unworthy of it's position. That is why it is maintained through violence and indoctrination, and not through donation.


Like I said before, some people are swayed by deontologica (moral) arguments and some are swayed by consequentialist arguments. If you take to heart the idea that initiating violence against other people to get what you want is wrong, then the NAP will make sense and you will see the violence of government for what it is. It is hard to separate out violence and an emotional reaction to it.


Again, if you understand that government uses violence and the threat of violence to extort money from citizens, while producing nothing of value on it's own, and then prohibiting competition for something like police services, then the police basically become mercenaries who are paid to enforce laws (regardless of how they feel about them) using money stolen from citizens. In a way, that's a thug. A hired gun.

This comment suggests that without central coercive government, there couldn't be any sort of civil society. [Start here](
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:25:20
I certainly appreciate you taking a look at the book. It does give me some hope. Even if you completely disagree with it's content, your efforts to open your mind are admirable. 
I just want to clarify something that you may or may not be aware of that importantly relates to ideas of liberty and some forms of anarchy, such as anarcho-capitalism.
If you are looking to have every question answered, every lifeboat scenario solved by the theory of libertarianism/free market anarchism/anarcho capitalism before you consider it "non utopian" or "realistic," I believe you are looking at it incorrectly. The idea of a society built around the free market is concerned mainly with letting people interact with one another voluntarily, without coercion. If your goal is liberty, then this MUST be important to you. Allowing people to freely associate, trade, cooperate, compete, etc without threats of violence is central to the theory of what I believe constitutes a more civilized world. People love to talk about how taxes are the price of a civilized society, however it makes no sense to say that civility is predicated on coercive state violence. 
There are two main ways to come to this type of anarchism: deontology and utilitarian. The deontological view essentially is that it is immoral to initiate violence against other people and their property, or basically the Non Aggression Principle. If you are the type of person to be persuaded by moral arguments, and if your goal is to have freedom, the NAP make ring true for you. If it does, then you cannot see coercive government as anything but immoral, despite any benefits it may happen to provide. 
Many people will point out that rights are a social construct. Therefore saying that we should automatically respect property rights is bogus. Those anarchists who are ambivalent about using arguments from morality are often utilitarians. That is, they believe that if you follow the non aggression principle and respect property rights anyway, not doing it from a morality standpoint, then the society that develops will still be better than what we have today. It doesn't take much effort to learn about all of the direct and indirect harm government causes for its citizens, and the citizens of other countries. The utilitarians believe that freedom and respect for property rights will end up helping people the best. In most cases, there are arguments to be made that the poor will benefit the MOST from economic and social freedom.
I wrote that wall of text to hopefully help you as you read the book. If your goal is simply to read it and poke holes in it, you've missed the point. Clearly no philosophy will ever create a utopia. Everything has its pros and cons. If you understand that our current systems don't solve most of these problems either, and still have to employ violence to fail, consider attempting a society based on non-violence.
@_date: 2014-06-10 00:29:37
Sure they do. However, in a market where you cannot use the government to give you special advantages, there are incentives for market players to not collude with other entities. That's not to say anti-competitve behaviors won't happen. But when they are instituted into law at the public expense using public dollars, that's not better.
@_date: 2014-08-24 22:25:03
Capitalism is private ownership over means of production, and often includes free trade and profit motive. The government, through the initiation of the use of force, creates perverse incentives which destroy healthy trade. 
Capitalism can exist without government. Government cannot exist without the forced transfer of wealth to fund expenditures. The state takes money, and unscrupulous business entities (people, really) bid for money they don't have a right to.

Wow, what a boring, tired, thoroughly rebutted argument. Feudalism does not entail a respect for property rights. You had a King who ruled all. Capitalism, in order to have private ownership, must necessarily also entail private property rights for all people. That is what differentiates it from Feudalism.

The fact that you watched the video, yet use the word Utopia shows that you either didn't understand it, or did, but are not interested in having a serious conversation. Giving you the benefit of the doubt, i'll address your either statements.


Not really. Unfortunately humanity has always erred on the side of force. Some people like power. Government provides it. No one willingly gives up power. There are examples of free trade all over the place, like ebay, but governance as a whole, not so much. However, this is not an argument against the principles. Just means they haven't been tried. Ask someone in the 1700s to imagine a world without slavery, and you'd get quizzical looks. Asking people to consider a world without coercive government is similar in this day.


Why? How it everything being private any different than everything being public, or a combo of the two? If you that is to be the basis of your society, then there is no reason to expect that private everything is not completely implementable. 


This is a very tough question. Hopefully someone else can give you something.


Because most people aren't interested in conversation, or learning. They are looking for confirmation bias. If people don't agree with them, they shrug it off and pretend everyone else is wrong. What this means is that: if I were to tell you that many of your questions would be answered by reading [For A New Liberty]( (free download from the link), would you go and read the 400+ pages to learn? Most people won't. A 20 minute video is a reasonable amount of time more people are willing to spend.

Why should they?


Why should they?


Why should they?


You seem to think that people keeping their own money and spending it how they wish is greed, yet being forced to give up your money to pay for the things OTHER people want is NOT greed. That makes no sense, and it is exactly how the government wants you to think. Do you really find it so bad to let people decide for themselves how to spend their labor?


Except for the fact that without government everything is private property. If you don't pay to use the road, you won't be allowed on it. Very simple.


Oh I think it will be so much better, because all of the energy/time/resources that government has wasted on killing people and the other awful things it does/has done could have gone into productive endeavors.


That's not an argument. 


Why do people who clearly don't know any fundamentals of Anarcho Capitalism/libertarianism insist on talking as if they do? Go read any seminal work on libertarianism and it will describe how the NECESSARY functions of police/defense/law/courts could happen WITHOUT compulsory government. I must assume you've not read any basic literature on the matter.


Taxes are the pinnacle of greed. "Here, you worked hard! I'm taking your money to do with as I see fit! If you don't like it, here's my gun."


Have you heard of national debts? Who gets to keep paying the interest+principle on those debts? Your children will. They didn't ask for them, nor will they receive the benefits that the people today are receiving, but they will still pay. The future is sold off to pay for bullshit today.


It makes good sense, to those who have made the effort to open their minds a bit.


Oh yes, because reddit is really the bastion of intelligent political thought. The place that had a boner for Obama, then after getting fucked over has now moved on to Warren.

The "greater good" is just bullshit emotional manipulation. NOBODY knows what is best for everyone else. Nobody can define what the greater good is. To appeal to it, and to force people to give up their income to fund it, is absurd.


Including those who run the government. Why is handing power over to them better than letting people make their own decisions, which cannot have as disastrous effects as those of central government?


Restated, this could mean: If people can decide for themselves what to do with their money, *I* may not get what I want, and I don't want that, therefore, let's use force against them! The "right" thing is different for everybody. Why do you want to use violence to stop peaceful people who disagree with you from doing as they please?


Insulting a philosophy by insinuating that teenagers are stupid and naive is not a great way to go about discourse. 


Yeah, not initiating force against peaceful people and letting them spend their money as they see fit - total nonsense, and no application to our current reality which is a brutal mess of sociopathic entities wielding armies as their play toys and enriching themselves by making everyone else poor.


You mean different people have different ideas? Wow! All government parties have different ideas. This issue never goes away. Anarchism attempts to mitigate the bad effects of different desires by not forcing everyone to live under one set of rules. 


Well you dismissed ideas of libertarianism by not going past the basics, and then cannot understand a basic principle of libertarianism that national debt is money stolen from future generations, and then you complain about there being other ways of doing things when you don't even understand the one I'm talking about! How can I call you anything but close minded? 


I never called you dumb. But writing up paragraphs decrying a philosophy you lack a basic understanding of makes you close minded. You have not rejected libertarianism on its merits - you don't even understand it. I'm sure you happily vote to take freedom away from others in order to get what you want. You call that "civilized?"

Libertarians would love to get a couple square miles of this to create a community. However, the government has claimed ownership of this land, even though it doesn't use it, and will use taxpayer money to to violently defend it if you don't pay the tithe (property taxes). 


That's not sensible at all. Would you advocate someone trying to change the MO of the Mafia to do it by joining the mafia and then campaigning to change people's minds? Why any with the government. Participating in a system you find unethical is silly and counter productive.

We are discussing a proof of concept. A small community the demonstrates the success of libertarian values will gain followers who currently think government is best.


Because living in antartica with no resources is not the way to build a successful economy. That's only a way for already rich people to get away because they have sufficient resources. That isn't the point.


Absolutely. Everyone should be free to associate and try out their own preferred system of governance. 


Well the point would be to recognize that the government has no legitimate claim on the land it taxes in the first place. It has just conned people into believing that it does. Libertarians accept a homesteading principle, such that using/improving land grants ownership, and after that it can be sold/gifted/transferred voluntarily.
So, if the people stop believing the government has ownership of the land, and stops giving them the money to use guns to enforce a bogus claim, everyone has enough land to do what they want. If communists are attempting to farm, mine minerals and metals, etc, libertarians will peacefully recognize that claim to land. 


Wonderful, isn't it?

No offense, but your criticisms have all been heard a bajillion times and there are thousands of pages of seminal libertarian and free market works by moralists, psychologists, and nobel laureate economics showing theoretical and historical examples of why the objections you raise don't happen in the ways you expect they might. 
If these ideas are new to you, I understand very well the initial reaction to write them off as unworkable. Most people do. However, I can assure you there are great answers to all of these questions in the literature.
However, none of that really matters. The only thing that matters is that current governments will not let people try out these ideas. They force them, under threat of violence and imprisonment to participate in the current system. Any person who supports democracy should also support the idea of peacefully opting out of democracy and being left alone to try something new. Do you support that?

What a plan they had...
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:52:50
Yeah but you need armies to use against the people when they try to use alternative currencies.

You're deluded.


Name an action taken by the government that you would disagree with then.

What would be your suggestion?

Unfortunately, exiting the euro doesn't mean the people of greece know how to resurrect their economy. They have made very poor decisions for years to get into this position, and although they may be ready for something different, they may not know what is best, or be willing to make sacrifices.

An alternative system, such as one without a monopoly on the creation of currency which cannot be printed or borrowed on a whim, will prevent countries bribing citizens in the here and now with free or heavily subsidized stuff and not making them pay for it. Go look at the national debt of Norway, or Sweden. Increasing year over year. 
Why? Because they took the wealth they built with largely free economies throughout most of the 20th century and are now blowing it on unsustainable social welfare programs. 
Sound money would mean you can't pass off your lifestyle to be paid by the unborn. I'd call that a big improvement.

More cuts then. Raise the retirement age, no more new debt
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:13:17


You are absolutely right. And this is the mentality we hope to change by talking to people about real liberty. Getting a majority of people together to enforce your will on the minority is not a civilized way to organize.


No it's factored in. The more land you have, the more land you have to defend, and your costs go up. At some point economics will make it not worthwhile to try and obtain any more land if you can't do anything productive with it.

I've already gone through those steps. It doesn't work because no matter what when I log into coinbase it still tries to send 2FA to my old number. That's why I reached out to coinbase via email and got nothing. 
I don't know if coinbase doesn't talk to authy or what, but there should be a much better way, built into coinbase, to change your phone number.

OK, since you seem heavily focused on roads, I'm going to attempt to take a shortcut and tell you that if you are actually curious how private roads could work, in detail, then [this book]( has all you'll need. Free PDF link there as well. Every point you raised has been studied and considered in great detail. 
Now, since that book is rather long, I'll take a shot at a few of your points:


Who said there is no regulation? What does regulation even mean to you? Road owners will have an incentive to maximize the inter-connectivity of their roads so that more people can use them. More users = more revenue. Regulations and standards will be born out of this desire. Even though they are competitors, it behooves them to cooperate. For a real historical example, consider how the various railroad manufacturers standardized on a track gauge.


Very likely 1. The market exists to make the interface between a user and a service as cost-effective as possible. Consider that EZ-Pass coordinates the roads between multiple states, hundreds of municipalities, and so on. But, when I'm driving in my car and I have the transponder on my windshield, I can drive the entire eastern seaboard having to only interact with ONE company: EZ-pass


Again, EZ-pass takes care of most of it, and a toll booth can do the rest. If the road connects busineses to homes or a shopping mall, than the businesses can pay the road owner, and it can be free at the point of use for the driver.


That's conjecture. We know that people have incentives to take care of their own property if they want to make revenue on it.


Well no. That assumes we use the outdated method of road payment we use today. But there are other options, and the market can develop better ones when the government isn't in control.


The people who wish to use them. [The Machinery of Freedom]( will give an INTRO into privatized, competitive law enforcement. It will raise a lot of questions, so if you are further interested the book by the same name is far more detailed.


Social ostracism. If Jim shoots Mary and then chooses not to accept the verdict of the court that sides with Mary, the community can stop selling Jim food or renting him an apartment.


The law is subjective now. All law is, is opinions backed up with guns.

Well then they would have to justify to me why I should face prison for disagreeing with them, as that is what they support, while I would not visit any harm on them for disagreeing with me.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:31:14
That would make too much sense.
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:55:28
[Are you sure about that?](


Likely a system of voluntarism, where people form small communities based on shared preferences and values. No coercion, no taxation, no one is forced to pay for programs they don't want to pay for. When they abstain, they are denied access to that service.
Democracy means that if you are in the minority on an issue, your money will still be taken from you to pay for that program. How is that civilized?

I'm not sure how you say it's decreasing when the data clearly shows it increasing. Are you suggesting it's DEFICIT is decreasing?


In the society we are describing there is no public property. Everything is privately owned. Want to use a road, you pay for it (or it is paid for up front in multiple ways). Want police services? You pay a police company a fee for services, just like you do now with your cell phone.


Yep! You only get what you pay for, and since there are no taxes, you decide 100% of what to spend your money on.

Jeez. Coinbase tells me to get authy to switch my account phone number. I set up authy on my phone, but coinbase still wants to send 2F codes to my old number. Frustrating.

It's not even repubs or dems: evil people who seek political office to exert power over other people are responsible. Until we remove a centralized power than can do this to people, we will NEVER improve because we will NEVER "elect better people."
"Better" people aren't evil and don't want to wield power over others.

Its not wrong at all. If you think it is, try complaining to nature and see how far you get!

The fact that you think the concepts of voluntarism and anarchy are right-wing is hilarious
