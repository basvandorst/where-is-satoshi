Can someone explain what this means to someone who has never really gotten into bitcoin like myself?   I've heard of it, and know a little about it, but that's about it

ok, so this is simply a currency exchange rate.
I'm not sure if you are an advocate, but how am I supposed to separate this from your average pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2011-06-08 01:48:28
you are correct for the most part, but it's concerning to me that it is going up in value so fast.
I would think a good currency would very slowly gain value and reputation over time.  A currency which rises this fast makes me think people are just getting in as speculators, and will drop out the moment it looks like it's going down.

well this subreddit is starting to look a lot like where everyone is a stock trader, and talks in financial lingo - Lingo I'm not that familiar with.
A few years back, it seemed like this subreddit was more people that were techies.  Which is kind of symbolic of what i'm saying about speculators.

well, the point is, unless there is a super compelling reason, someone who has a lot of money in USD [or another currency] has no reason to switch their currency into bitcoins, because they will be going from a currency in which they are rich into a currency in which they are just middle of the road.

While thats valid, and your other points are valid, I highly doubt the market would be more unstable without the speculators.  
No offense to you, but sometimes I think that financial traders try to justify that their work is a societal good a lot more than it actually is.

what price does it need to be in order to level off?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:34:44
thus the early adopters would be the 1%
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:03:35
If there were no speculators in the bitcoin market, why would there be more risk?  The price of bitcoin would actually be its functional value it seems to me.

i'm no expert, can you explain what you mean?
also, what's with all the downvotes?  Geez, I can't even offer a different opinion?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:47:20


Didn't say I didn't know how finance works, I said I'm not that familiar with all of the lingo.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:50:53
definitely.  How many people on are actually buying/selling shit with their bitcoins?   Probably not many
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:18:41
but why would someone buy 10 bitcoins for $500k in the future when so many people bought 10 bitcoins at prices like $50 before?
The market would be completely imbalanced, with the early adopters all being the top 1%.

If that's true, bitcoin is destined to fail as a currency.  A currency which only increases in value will be a currency people don't spend.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:06:59
why?  It could be a way to do legal trade as well in the future, should the need arise [IE: other currencies become too corrupted/unstable]
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:22:47
well that's what i'm saying already.  If bitcoins continue to be as unstable as it is right now, people WON'T adopt it as a real currency in the future.
