I support Trump but he's obviously flat out wrong. Just like all the other 70+ year olds. 
This is a major signal to buy

Retards in this thread with TDS. If anybody is a libertarian and understands crypto, It would be Trump. He isn't any other investor. He's one of the most influential businessmen out of NY. 
You wouldn't see Obama endorse either, him and his Democrat cronies are the enemy of the blockchain

With true anonymity, means zero exposure. You seriously want Bitcoin to be hidden? Choose.

Literally a list of every successful buisness of his, compared to your few that failed. You're just mad now
I'll give you 0.0061 BTC if you correctly count the buisnesses in that picture. Go ahead

Good guy John. Gets too much hate tbh

I play pick up when I'm not at practice. I know tons of 26+ that still play semi pro ball. If you're in as good as shape as you claim, then try out for the XFL this fall. With your height/weight and BMI, you'll make a good back up kicker.

The only Democrat that advocates for crypto is Yang. Democrats are overwhelmingly against Bitcoin because "it can be used to by drugs"

hahaha yeah you think that's funny? What sports do you (currently) play. I'm just curious. Also, trading crypto isn't a sport
