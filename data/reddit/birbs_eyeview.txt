Square’s cash app works in NY, not sure how they compare to Gemini.

they are backed by square a rather large company, and have complied with the NY Bitlicense law. So they are definitely legit.
I currently use them and I’m thinking of using Gemini as well, as cash app only works with bitcoin, not other alt coins.
But I’m new, so definitely look into them and see what you think, just wanted to provide another option.

Kraken isn’t available in my location so I’m stuck with Gemini, Coinbase pro or cash app ( plus a few smaller companies )
Is gemini worth the extra cost over coinbase pro?

I did some research on Gemini and it seems in this last year they’ve increased their fees and have had other issues people were complaining about.

Do you have any opinion on Coinbase pro? I know a lot of people dislike them, but compared to Gemini that is.
My goal is to buy some crypto here and there, offload it at a certain point to what’s called a cold wallet, and then sell it way down the road hopefully for some profit. So being able to withdrawal the coins are important to me.
I’ve read negative things about cash app ( what I’m currently using ) ( Gemini) which seems alright and what you recommended and finally Coinbase pro, but people really seem disgusted with Coinbase here. Worst cases I’ve seen people claim account closures and losing access to their coins.
With cash app I’m restricted to only bitcoin, but at least I can withdrawal and it operates within NY law ( lol ) so I’m trying to find one that works with other coins as well, so I’m stuck between Gemini and Coinbase pro.. and maybe others. 
Regardless thanks for your responses and I have a lot of reading to do. I just purchased 20 dollars worth of bitcoin to test it on cash app, and my lord did I have to jump through hoops to get verified ( which I did ) and had to call my bank twice.
Seems people want to make acquiring crypto a pain in the ass

My 20 dollars is now worth 23.55
