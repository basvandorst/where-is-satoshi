A Bitcoin ETF is NOT a solution. I kept telling people that once BTC futures started trading that BTC would top out at whatever price they started trading at and of course people thought I was an idiot. Futures gave institutions access to short BTC and they will short the BTC ETF. This is not what Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is supposed to be about.

Good luck brother! It seems you've done a lot of research and you're confident about your investment which is really good as there are many people that dump their $ into it without knowing exactly what they're doing. Hold for the long term
