If he really likes bitcoin, he'll leave it the fuck alone because Paypal will do nothing but fuck it up.

I wouldn't worry too much. PayPal sells off their debt to a debt collector like everyone else, at which point you can easily make a case against them and not have it hit your credit report.

Because the title mentions bitcoin going above $1k and that makes them excited in the pants.

Don't let ebay's bullshit affect your credit score. If they ever go after you, dispute it like crazy. The credit bureaus don't dock people for businesses' lack of management skills.

Collector is only the first step. They buy the debt from the business, in this case asshole PayPal, for pennies on the dollar. Then they go after you to pay them. If you don't pay them, they report your debt to the credit bureau, but they can only do that if you don't dispute. If you dispute the debt, the business has to respond and say "no they totally owe this and here's all our support for that". If they don't do that, the collection agency can't take the issue any further. And even then, if they DO get past that step and report to the bureaus, you can contact the bureaus and make your case there. 
At least, that's the way I understand it from my experience dealing with paypal's bullshit. Others can feel free to chime in, as I am in no way a lawyer. 
But fight. Don't give them any money. Fuck PayPal and their predatory business practices. They go after the honest party because they're more likely to recoup their losses that way.

I had the same experience years and years ago. I had receipts, shipping notices, etc. I even went a step further and contacted the seller of another item related to the one the buyer purchased from me who said the buyer also initiated a chargeback against him that he was also fighting. PayPal couldn't have cared less. Never again.
