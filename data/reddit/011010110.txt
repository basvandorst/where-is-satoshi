It is not commensurate with murder,  I think we can knock the hyperbole on the head for a bit. There was a general understanding, whether correct or not, that these funds were insured. The hacker may have assumed no one but the insurance company would be financially affected by the theft. Also who in their right mind is putting so much money into bitcoin that the loss of it could bring about their financial ruin. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:52:26

No you did not read it, it is not an article, it is the measure and the methodology.

Bitcoin can not "go fractional reserve" if you disagree then you don't understand bitcoin. A bitcoin service may go fractional reserve but anyone with bitcoin who knew it was a fractional reserve would avoid it and it would be unable to operate.

If you don't believe in bitcoin enough to convert fiat to BTC then there probably isn't much hope of meeting your goals.
Anyway you are looking at it all wrong. You are trying to cater to the small number of people who hold bitcoin, what you should be doing is creating a service or product that people need and then promoting bitcoin as a payment option. Or making your product or service Blockchain based, therefore requiring bitcoin to use it. 
Plus the "I had hoped people wouldn't be..." comment at the end there, essentially ridiculing the very people you want to engage, is not very useful and makes you seem petulant and not someone who I would consider going into business with. It also assumes that all bitcoin holders are the same, again t makes you look like a twat rather than someone to engage with.

Why should you have to move it after 90 years, if your cold storage gas kept them secure for that long why would you move them? 
Also someone else may suggest 50 years, or 25 years, what's the reasoning behind 100 years other than an arbitrary large figure you chose? 
Essentially though what you are asking is for the network to have the capability of taking someone's coins without having the private key. That is akin to banks in Cyprus taking a cut of everyone's deposits on a whim. If that functionality existed it could be abused.

Holy shit do I feel lucky. I started trying to withdraw over $10k in the summer and just had delay after delay, I kept up the emails and support tickets, finally paying a 5% bank fee to speed up the process. Evidently this 5% fee was a gox fee to recoup some money. Anyway while that was ongoing I withdrew all of my remaining BTC (just under 75 coins). The Fiat was finally paid out in October 2013.
I feel bad for those with coins and fiat stuck in gox. I spent almost 6 months getting that fiat withdrawal processed glad I persevered. 
In light of this outcome it also makes sense as to why they were not letting non-verified accounts withdraw BTC. They were the easiest to refuse and it could be done without rasing too many suspicions. 
If the theory proposed by Roger P on bitcointalk.org is accurate Mark should have fronted up to the loss when it happened. At that stage he had done nothing illegal, since then of course every attempt at covering up the problem likely involved some illegality. 
This is going to be a source of drama for bitcoin for sometime to come, at least until we know what happened. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 13:12:51
Mt.Gox did the exact same thing, not verifying customers from certain countries and then keeping their bitcoins, the fewer people they verified the more bitcoins they could keep. Not saying Bitstamp are definitely doing the same thing but they don't warn you when depositing coins.

what people do you see with lots of coins? why shoud they be responsible for fixing mtgox mistakes? why should people who were happy to use gox when the price was high be bailed out by people that kept coins off gox?
Were you suggesting a bailout for people failed by bitcoinica? or pirateat40? or is it just that you lost money on gox so this time we should bail people out?
you are conflating mtgox with the bitcoin economy, mtgox will just be like SILK ROAD, important for a while, then a bit of a thorn in the side of bitcoin and then a footnote.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:08:54
Doesn't really insure you however as you get insured in fiat and not btc so between your coins being stolen and making a claim any volatility or change is not covered. If the price goes up you get the value on the day they were stolen, If the price goes down you get the payout at the new lower value. A very one sided insurance cover. Better than nothing but it is not insuring BTC rather the Fiat value of them at the time of the theft or the claim depending on which is the lowest.

'sell on gox' or 'sell on mtgox' 
'arbitrage' which is the technical name given to the action being described. 
Honestly this question is asked at least once per week.  The answer is that you can do it but getting money out of gox is very difficult. So if I spend $7800 on 10btc on coin base and sell immediately on gox for $9200 I make a paper profit of $1400 however you then have to wait 6 months to get money out of gox. During which time 10btc may be worth considerably more than the $9200 you sold them for.

Why? 
They never engaged in a 51% attack. 
Any pool would be hurting them selves if they did, a lot of this is panic. A real 51% attack comes from someone who wants to bring down the network. That is not a pool where people can remove their hashing power whenever they want, that is a nations take wanting to destroy bitcoin.

They don't have any specific issues with bitcoin though, they just don't like it either due to jealousy or they don't understand it. There is nothing they are suggesting needs to be fixed before they will use it.  They are not the people that need to be convinced so don't waste your time on that subreddit. Speak to people new to bitcoin that would be much more useful. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:12:43
Ok chill out. 
The deposit address they give you links the ccoins to your account but they generally will not be stored there. The exchange stores the coins on either a hot wallet or cold wallet so after you send them to your account address they are moved to the exchanges main wallet address. 
What  this means is your account should show the coins as credited buy they may no longer be at the address you sent them to. 
Wait for btce support. I have used them for various coins and fiat for at least 2 years now and they have always been reliable.

Do you think this will benefit New York? I ask because there are 2 main financial centres one is New York the other is London. Don't you think that this sort of regulation will harm the adoption and use of bitcoin in New York and push people to other locations such as London? 
Do you really think this is enforceable? If I run a Web wallet I don't ask where a user is from and I don't need to ask for the purposes of my business. Similarly a coin mixing service can be used by anyone and again I don't ask for the users location and don't need to so I would never register with you because the location of my customers is unknown to me.

yes but how do you know when they have been cashed out? all you will see is that they have been sent to a new address, you will not know when the address is an exchange where the seller will be exchanging them for cash.
If the thief buys something from a retailer you have the same issue, yes the retailer may have their address details but you will not know anything other than the wallet address, not the name of the retailer or what they sell so no way to question them about the customer who used the coins.
Aditionally they could send the coins to an exchange where they have an account under an assumed name, sell the BTC for LTC, transfer the LTC to another exchange, buy back BTC and you will never be able to track them.
Trust me use it as a lesson and move on, as you said you bought them cheap so no major loss, it will just frustrate and annoy you as you spend more time on this without any possible solution.
You can monitor the address but really that is just going to tell you when the thief adds to his pile or moves your coins. Perhaps you will see other users who note stolen coins going to the same address but none of that will help recover your coins.

Don't think of it as own, think of it as control. If you buy bitcoins on mtgox you are only in control of them if you are the sole keeper of the private key. So while they are on gox you may own them but gox controls them and if gox goes bankrupt you would lose control of your coins even though you still own them. 
If you transfer them to your own wallet client such as electrum or to a paper wallet you control The private keys and mtgox failing would have no impact on you and your coins.

just linked it up to my laptop, then you go to mytrezor.com to set up a wallet.
PIN process is simple but you dont get the option of "0" which made PIN selection a little harder.
then you copy down the seed, i got distracted half way through and my laptop shut down so i had to start the process again but it was as simple as going back to mytrezor.com and the process started from the beginning.
you get a little card for writing down your details, device label and seed essentially.
Just sent 0.25btc to it to test it out. i am thinking that one of mine will be used to only hold 21 BTC so it will be a first edition, one in a million device.

No you would have to fundamentally change the way bitcoin works to negate the possibility of a 51% attack. 
This may be a storm in a teacup, sooner or later other miners will increase their capacity (ASICMINER) and this will cause ghash share to fall somewhat. 
Of course if a bad actor hacked ghash and took control of the pool there is potential for significant harm to be caused.

I am not sure you understand what Bitfunder was. It was a site that allowed people to release shares of their company for people to invest. The investor funds were placed on the site and when shares were sold the funds were transferred to the company. This  final step did not happen in its entirety because Bitfunder closed it's doors before they could  withdraw or prevented withdrawals because they knew they were closing their doors. I don't see how that is the fault of Neo and Bee.

it really doesnt sound like you understand how bitcoin works. there is no technical solution that will allow anyone to reverse transactions to reclaim these coins.
the community os not in control of the purse, people that own coins are, more specifically you are in charge of the private keys of your coins. you cannot do anything about anyone elses private keys unless you know them.
The only option is to find out the initial transactions that represent the coins being moved from mtgox to a new address, a transaction that they say they did not initiate. 
you can follow those coins, but eventually they will end up in a mixer or an exchange, on an exchange they get swapped for an altcoin and ten swapped back to btc or fiat on another exchange. at the point that they hit the exchange or the mixer you can kiss goodbye to tracing them any further than that.
We cant empower the devs, the devs do what the devs do, if the miners like it they adopt it,. If the devs make it and miners adopt it then bitcoin gets it.

doesnt work like that, those units are sold out so you are not getting them today. to get that much you have to buy every retail unit from every manufacturer and you are paying full retail price because they will sell out whether you buy them or not so no incentive for the manufacturer to do you a deal. then you have to wait and hope they deliver, that means people like ASICMINER, ACTIVEMINING, GHASH.IO all get time to bring on more hashpower. So maybe you dont have enough, so next is going for the R&amp;D route manufacturing your own chips that is still going to cost you a fair whack.
it is not as simple as just multiplying cost per hash and hash rate, power, time, manpower, expertise. can you imagine what it would take to get a mining farm set up that is bigger than the current network. The power usage alone would be astronomical, but consider how much space and cooling is required and you can start to calculate the real cost of an attack.

Try r/bitcoinuk 
There is no where that is devoted to this sort of transaction. Your best bet is to offer it for sale on places like Gumtree and make a point of listing the price as GBP and BTC. Then I would try contacting your local newspaper to see if they will cover it because of the BTC angle, perhaps the METRO on a slow day mat give you a mention. All this is aimed at increasing the visibility of your property not really selling it for BTC however you may find a buyer out there. 
Your issue if you sell it for BTC will be the need to cash in the coins asap to cover the mortgage. I suggest setting up a Bitstamp account and getting verified in advance of any transaction so there is no delay between selling the house and paying the bank their money.

No offence but you are hardly the first person to warn against a 51% attack,  satoshi outlined it from the very beginning. 
Mining has worked out in practice for 5 years,  even with today's concern about Ghash it has worked and it continues to work. 
You are not getting the people with knowledge to get a replacement ready you are whining about needing to change things without offering any constructive ideas. 
If an alternative solution was that easy we would see it in an altcoin already. The fact we have not is because right now proof of work is the best we have. 
As I said if you have something concrete to add make a suggestion but don't act like you are doing something when you make these posts. And no I have not been reading your submissions for the at 6 months. If you had been following bitcoin for the last 2 years you would know that almost exactly the same thing happened with the btc guild mining pool and it was resolved the n much the same way as it was today,  that is miners moved equipment away from the pool in question. The difference now is we had a load of idiots making a ton of posts that filled the front page and people, who don't really understand how bitcoin or mining works, freaked out.

I suggest firing up the wallet to see if it has a balance and then you will know whether to keep the wallet.dat or not. 
If you have any coins you can keep the wallet.dat file to restore them at some future time and delete the rest of the bitcoin data.

There have been 3 pools that have got close to the 50% mark and in each h and every case when miners have become aware they have moved power away from these pools. Each time we are seeing slight variations,  this time ghash owns a lot of the hash power but no where near enough to get 50% on their own. 
I think this is to do with the immaturity of the network at present. Soon ASICMINER will bring out its next gen chips,  Active Mining should also do the same, both of these firms manufacture mining equipment and run mining farms, these are likely to be ghash.io main competitors for network share. 
The success and follow cex/ghash.io will bring others to the game offering similar services,  right now they just have first mover advantage. 
I don't think it is quite time to overhaul the protocol just yet as the bitcoin community has proven itself to be quite effective at self policing this sort of issue.

If you take a risk buying from localbitcoins.com then you also take a risk when you don't properly secure your bitcoin wallet. 
The end result is you will not get your coins back, you will be lucky to get any info from an exchange. Your best bet is to inform the police but they will probably do very little but they could compel the exchange to provide some information on the account that sent the coins to them. 
However sending them to a crypto only exchange would allow the person to exchange them, e.g. for  litecoin. A crypto only exchange requires no identification. They could withdraw the litecoin and send it to another exchange to swap back for bitcoin, before sending the clean bitcoin  to an exchange where it is swapped for e.g. USD. 
tracking them will be hard and for $12k probably not worth the polices time and effort.

So if 500btc are stolen will they refund you 500btc or the equivalent in GBP OR USD? 
The problem comes when I have my 10 BTC stolen today at £500 each,  by the time an investigation is complete and insurance pays out the value of btc may be £1500, are Lloyds going to say I had £5000 or £15000 in BTC? They are going to want to pay out on the value at the time they were stolen and not the current value, unless of course price falls to £100 per coin,  at which time they will want to replace your 10 btc for £1000 instead of the £5000 it was worth when it was stolen.

When Bitfunder closed the listing was transferred to havelock, however at that stage trading was taking place between private individuals that held shares in NeoBee, you did not buy shares directly from the organisation known as Neo &amp;  Bee. 
If you go to a stockbroker today to buy apple shares you are not buying then from Apple. You buy them from someone else that wants to sell them. Same thing on havelock, ASICMINER does not sell you shares, people that bought ASICMINER shares at an earlier point in time sell you the shares.

Coins don't need to be in cold storage to be truly owned. If I have coins on electrum or the QT wallet or even blockchain.info wallet, then I am in control of the private keys and therfore own the coins. 
However I prefer the term control to own when discussing bitcoins. You need to be in control of the private keys to be in control of the coins. 
You can own coins on an exchange but you do not control them while they remain on the exchange.

In the initial aftermath consumable goods will be the defacto currency. Once the initial system shock is dealt with and people  can start to think beyond their next 3 meals, which could be anywhere between 3 weeks and 3 years, then they will think about currency. If it's longer than 3 weeks though that indicates that power and computer networks have been significantly impacted and bitcoin at that point is pretty much dead, so metals will probably be the currency of choice.

try 1000 or 10,000 times as long, using electricity which may be in short supply at the time, for some btc which may or may not be useable. If it takes 10000 minutes to mine a block, thats just short of a week, so now your transaction is going to take a week to process and 3 weeks before you know it cant be double spent. Not very useful in that scenario.
Difficulty readjustment is every 2015 blocks, so if a block takes 1 week, then it takes 38 years for a readjustment. if a block takes 100 times as long (1000 minutes) thats still 3+ years for readjustment. Again, not practical.
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:33:19
Maybe you don't understand how bitcoin works, difficult adjustments and transaction times matter. You need an orderly exit of mining power so that you have a workable system. Lose too much too soon and the block times mean you cannot transact in a reasonable time frame, which makes it useless. At that stage you might as well start your own local blockchain.
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:46:54
The internet is designed to be decentralised and will work, partially, there is no Facebook but you could throw up a BBS style site that could be used. If an apocalypse hit tomorrow or next week the difficulty readjustment required to make bitcoin work would take a long time if we lost most of the Chinese miners,enough that it would be impractical to restart.
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:08:34
The vast majority of miners are located in China, reports of around 70 to 75 %. So while miners are distributed they are still concentrated in certain areas. They also require a level of manpower to maintain. If the shit hit the fan are those people who monitor, reboot, repalce cables etc going to hang around or are they going to find their families and do what they need to to survive? The miners that will continue are smaller hobby miners who have their mining operations close to home and even if we say that these type of miner control 25% of the mining network, and a further 25% of the large miners continue operating through automation, we have halved the processing power. But it's going to be 3 months at best before things settle enough that anyone is transacting in bitcoin, at which point more will have gone off line and no new hardware is coming online, not for a long time. So no, in the event of an apocalyptic event , bitcoin or crypto is not going to be the currency of first choice. I'm a big believe in bitcoin but bitcoin only works if the world is interconnected the way it is today, with almost unlimited power supply and communication networks. You can't eat bitcoin.

i thought so too, but thebcci.net seems to have been held by others in the time period mentioned. the other linked sites are not convincing either.
The domain for alexanderhawthorn has panamanian details. And not to disparage Panama and its people, but if you have registered something online in panama then it is probably not 100% legit.
Im sure more digging will unearth more inconsistencies. I had hoped for some truth, but no I figure part 2 will tell us why he can no longer access the coins. Probably because they are all on the computers that Hal Finney allowed him access to remotely or he lost his password or he never mined them at all. I am not sure how he was able to mine 980k coins if his hardware for development was an old laptop and remote machines, it doesnt sound like he had a spare i7 machine lying around to run ion the network 24/7.
So whilst more information might be interesting I dont see it being true.
If Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to tell their story and be believed, they could simply write this all up, stick it on a website, sign the earliest mined block that you can with a message pointing to said site and boom, worldwide notice.

EDIT: MORE ISSUES
The original post referred to Hal Finney as being a cyberpunk, it then uses the wikipedia description of a cypherpunk. Hal Finney was a cypherpunk. Shortly after a reddit comment pointed this out, it was changed. 
The original article used BBCI and BCCI, if this was such a huge event in the authors life they would have got this correct. Again it was fixed up to be consistent. However i noticed that the title for one image still showed BBCI, mentioned it on here and now it has been corrected. So the discussion of this on various sites is being monitored and inconsistencies are being fixed and quietly. Which is pretty shady behaviour anyway.

I can't really see any further 'explosions'  in hash rate occurring now, GPUs AND ASIC certainly ramped things up but now we are in a position where virtually all mining is done on ASIC devices. When new chips become available one of the first impacts they have is to make older equipment obsolete, so in the short term they add hash rate but in the medium term older miners are turned off, in the long term it would tend to increase overall hash rate but I don't see any explosions occurring.

He hasn't done anything about exposing Muslim rape gangs. He has turned up at court after the investigation and arrests have been done by others and then he jeapordises that work to post some photos on twitter.

So I'm not really sure what you mean about his work to expose Muslim rape gangs.

they do have collectors value whenther you think so or not.
the original series (i.e with typo) coin went for $28k when BTC was at $14.5k so thats 100% premium for the coin itself.
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:30:12
Not greedy.
Mining machines need to provide an ROI, the sooner the better. Shortening the lifespan to mine more today is probably worthwhile given the historic difficulty increases.
Antminer should be providing a patch to secure against this instead of blaming it on unofficial firmware updates and leaving the equipment owners hanging in the wind.
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:35:42
As I understand it the firmware modifies the existing software it doesn't repalce it. Basically if it's possible then Antminer should make official software and let users use it safely if they want to. If it can be overclocked then users should have a right to overclock it. The company is forcing users to use unverified software if they want to use the machine (that they own) to its fullest potential. Imagine coinbase told you how you were allowed to use your bitcoin if you bought it from them.
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:37:47
They have collectors value now, these ones with the typo especially. They will always have a minimum value of 25BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:51:04
Yes. The minimum value is directly from the BTC they store, but these coins have a premium on due to being first, limited quantity etc ,the typo ones are even rarer so they have another premium on top.

I have to say that you are just pulling this from your ass. Plenty of those coins are still funded and in use. You can Google to see how many have been claimed or are in use.

But bitcoin would just be the longest unbroken chain, if the variable max coin chain had over 50% of the mining power then it would be considered bitcoin and be able to use the BTC ticker. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:30:45
BTC always maintained the longer chain against BCH and had the majority of hash power. The reason that BCH forked was because they knew they would not get majority hash power.
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:23:20
Nope. They released code they hoped would be adopted by a majority of miners, it became apparent that it was not going to get over the 50.1% threshold so they called it a fork.
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:56:22
I'm not sure why you think it would put off other institutional investors. This is a good thing for them as they have a modicum of charge back at this one point, which is their entry point into the market.

True but we learn these lessons as we go, that's one of the best things about software based systems, improvements can be made at almost any time once a need is identified. I don't remember any exchange I have used, and I have probably used almost all except Gemini at one stage or another, that had this sort of guardrail. I bet though that it will be implemented by other exchanges soon to prevent this happening to them. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:41:29
Not true. Bitxoin is just the longest chain, so if a developer wrote code to increase the limit above 21m and over 50% of mining power adopted this new code then bitcoin would have a higher max and still be bitcoin. It is a fork when the new code is adopted by less than 50% as with bitcoin cash/gold/diamond etc.

I imagine a cancel and Roll back is  better option. It sets a precedent which is good for new users, especially institutions who want safety and some form of cover in the event of fuck ups. However as with the stock exchange they don't always have to follow this rule. By eating the loss they set a terrible precedent in terms of their business. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:58:51
Sounds like they are holding the funds because of a link to illegal activity, their lack of communication with you is likely because of law enforcement telling them that they cannot communicate with you. If it is not related to illegal activity then you need to show where they coins came from and take then to court. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:08:39
Eating the loss sets a terrible precedent. Their T and Cs mean they are not obliged to. 
I  expect it was only reversed because they could get agreement from  the seller or the seller had not logged on yet so they could do it without their knowledge. Once it is done it is done. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:30:25
Because if they have ID showing Pete Smith and they received payment from Pete Smith's bank account it is very difficult for Pete Smith to say they didn't authorise the trade and get a charge back and also keep the coins. It also weeds our fraudsters who use other peoples bank accounts. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:54:18
Fixed, thanks 
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:50:58
I would even imagine they may initially reach out to the seller as a fiat transfer can take a few days and is linked to a real world person. That person may or may not consent and they have every right not to consent however 'today you tomorrow me'. If the seller was a long term user then they may prefer to remain using the site with some trade fee advantage rather than the short term gain the get otherwise. 
Of course if you listed a coin at $2200 you may not log in often so if an account was seemingly inactive it would be much easier to just do it without that user ever knowing.
If it was the other way and someone picked up cheap coins I doubt they would have as much success.

Many people do seem to buy clean coins eg from coinbase or circle,  and run them through a tumbler prior to sending them to a blackmarket. I think coinbase have in the past banned users who have sent coins from coinbase to a blackmarket directly. Thus clean coins are making their way onto tumblers but probably not in massive volumes.

It's more that if a buyer tells paypal their account was hacked and they didn't authorise the transaction paypal will take the money from your account and you will have sent the bitcoin with no way to get it back. Paypal ToS say you are not allowed to use PayPal to buy digital currencies so they will then case your account for violating those terms and you have still lost the bitcoin.

That will become an issue when people start using the Blockchain to record information. Probably ok for the first 12 or maybe 24 months of transactions but after that you are going to damage the usefulness of the Blockchain.

basically if you are holding btc you have already assumed 75% of the risk, which includes, but is not limited to, theft, data loss and price volatility. the rest is trust that you will be paid given there are no legally recognised contracts obligating them to do so. however given that they have consistently paid out on time so far, and not for fuck around amounts, serious sums regardless of whether you view it in BTC or USD, Theyhave built some serious goodwill as a business and that is worth quite a bit in the bitconomy.

you dont have escrow on craigslist. in the same way ebay is safer than craigslist so is bitmit, the only difference is the payment method.
how many times have you had to use the dispute resolution service on ebay? this is safer than ebay because you do not release the payment to the seller until you are happy. instead of sending it and hoping you get the goods.
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:23:07
bitcoin prices can be lower than fiat prices because you can send btc payments for a very tiny transaction fee, whereas paypal/visa will take anywhere between 3% and 10% of the transaction depending on the size.
pseudonymity for when you are buying the latest copy of horse cock lovers weekly.
when you want to buy something from china and it costs about $3 and it will cost you more than that in fees to change and send money there.
When you want to send $300,000 to a friend on another continent but dont want to pay extortionate bank fees for it.

All the bot can tell him is that he has a 49.5% chance of winning. Even if he hit 12 highs in a row the bot would tell him he had a 49.5% chance of winning with high on his next roll. 
This is not poker or blackjack, there is no skill involved. The odds are reset every roll. He is not betting on 4 highs in a row or 10 lows, each roll is a discrete bet. It is the equivalent of betting red or black on the roulette table, the 1% house edge is equivalent to the zero. 
If you need a bot to tell you how to bet on hi/lo red/black then you should probably stay the hell away from dice games.

more incentive for people to use the stolen credit card data that litters the internet, too much risk for the seller because there is no shipment of a physical good that can be verified. the blockchain and correspondence such as the provision of a BTC address and the sending of the coin to the address only prove the coin was sent but not to who.

in the UK that would be a crime under the misuse of a computer act (or something similar) whether the police pursue it would depend on the economic value and the evidence available to pursue it. If you collected all the IP info from the theft and it was forensically sound, i.e. you get it from the site that was hacked, then you improve your chances. But they may not have the resources or the skills (or both) to investigate.

but the value of btc to the dollar doesnt matter if interest is earned on and paid in btc. i.e 10% of 1 btc is still 0.1BTC, if bitcoin drops to $10 then your interest is only a dollar. i think in your scenario the bank has to hold $x worth of btc and hedge to ensure that you maintain the dollar value, whereas OP is looking for someone to hold and pay interest on btc.

It has a variety of uses but you may not be aware of them. Do you know that quite a substantial amount of money is repatriated to places like asia, africa and india by people living and working overseas via an informal person to person money brokers network, it is referred to as hawala banking. if they adopted bitcoin for the sending and exchanging of value (it already is in some instances but it could be much more widespread) then that is a huge market. this is a worldwide currency and people all over the world have different needs to you and this currency fulfills the needs of both, you can get your weed from the internet and the guy from pakistan, working in USA, can send home $200 a month for hardly any cost, instead of western union taking 10% of his money.
the reason it has to grow in value is because of the limited number of them, if the hawal banking people want to send a $1m dollars in small transaction and HSBC also want to send $100million dollars then there has to be enough coins to allow that to happen, so when they are worth $1000000 each, then a satoshi is worth 1 cent. So for HSBC to send their transaction they need 100 bitcoins but the hawala banking system could use 1 bitcoin to cover everyone of their smaller individual transactions.

They are currently 1btc from the manufacturer. They will be 0.6btc next week.  At that stage you are still going to be paying a premium because the manufacturer is in China, there is import duty to pay on it,  then if you have gone through a group buy more fees to pay,  plus shipping EU or domestic shipping. Then for your purchase if you don't want to pay BTC there are paypal fees, more again if you are selling via eBay. 
So you will pay a minimum of £20 over the manufacturers price if you just want to buy 1 unit. Additionally you will get the unit (from me anyway) usually within 1-2 days, buying from the manufacturer means at least a week long wait.  So these 0.6btc units will not be retailed until about a week after release, so 8th August at the earliest.

I for one would like to see the price increase when they are available for immediate purchase but I don't see that happening. With all the costs of development and the need to sell the resulting product, if BTC/USD is 300 dollars then the need to return a profit and shift some stock means the price will have to drop. After all the manufacturer doesn't want to be left with 5000 units they cannot use. Better to sell them for 0.5btc instead of no sale at all. 
Of course they could just send everyone who preordered a unit an extra one and then cut the price. At least early adopters would not be so screwed.

In addition to everyone else's points, I would say in part it is because the hard work was put in at an early stage by people who did not know they were going to create something so successful. The imitators were just amended bitcoin protocols designed to be different for different's sake so that their 'creators' could be the early adoptors and be the ones selling 500,000 LTC and retiring. So for that reason those other currencies are more forced.
Namecoin is different because it actually has another function.
The LTC is the next biggest altcoin and its network is very variable, the price is about 50 cents at the moment but the markets could not sustain a dump of around 200,000 LTC without completely wiping out the market.
Additionally no services have sprung up around litecoin because they already exists successfully as bitcoin sites, such as satoshidice, so ltc will not bring in people from outside the cryptocurrency scene in the way that bitcoin has.
I would also check out first mover advantage.
Finally there is the gold/silver btc/ltc analogy. which doesnt really apply because of the divisibility of the coins but they both co-exist so there is no reason you could not have 2 virtual currencies, or more, co-existing.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:10:42
No you are just basing this on all that has gone before. 
You say it 'must' become an official currency somehow. Why must it? Legitimacy can come from a government accepting it or amazon accepting it or even just enough people accepting it. 
You are trying to nail it into place within your current frame of reference. This is a new technology that you don't understand because it is unlike anything you are used to. 
Before the Internet people thought that you had to have a brick and mortar store to do retail, before the mobile phone people thought phone calls could only be made from and to static locations, before the car people thought that 8mph was the fastest a human could safely travel. Before bitcoin people thought you had to have a central bank for a currency to exist.

It has escrow, buyer puts the payment into escrow and releases it upon successful delivery. As usual keep tracking data in case it is required in the event of a dispute. Once the escrow is released that's it, no chance of a charge back 2 weeks down the line.

its a major bubble if it pops, but it is only a major one until the next one dwarfs it.

sell your 5830s and buy some usb miners, wait a week or so and they will be less than 0.4btc each. use the money you get from the sales of your 5830s to pay for them. you will at least cut down your power consumption and possibly increase your hash rate from where you currently are.
most items on preorder are in the range of 100s gigahash, even if onlly one or two of the main guys get a product shipped on time or a few weeks late you are looking at huge increases in difficulty by the end of this year and that 5gh is going to be having difficulty keeping up. you could wait until then and pick up a cheap 5ghash unit.

You can get gox prices by selling to other people instead of into the market. 
1. Buy BTC on virtex 
2. Send BTC to Gox
3. Sell BTC on gox at the higher price
4. Post ad on bitcointalk.org selling BTC for Gox plus 2%-3% for direct bank transfer. 
5. Send funds back to virtex. 
The added bonus is that your sales will not drive down the price on gox, meaning the price differential will last longer allowing more opportunity for profit.

To me that is the technology behind bitcoin, what it does it does well, it has a variety of other uses that can be coded into bitcoin itself so it has room to grow as a technology but just as a virtual currency it is pretty neat. Issues like the fork that we recently experienced show how resilient it is and how good the support is for it. So todays price drop was caused by market manipulation, not a problem with bitcoin. The problem is with the community and until we decentralize exchanges, or at least our reliance on mtgox, bitcoin will be open to this sort of manipulation.
However we could also view it as stress testing, in much the same way that erik voorhees says SD stress tests the network, well these events stress test the exchanges and the community, hopefully now mtgox has shown up wanting someone will come and take their place.

ok, I am not claiming to be an authority on this issue, so do your own research.
if i have 10btc in my wallet and i send 5btc to u/east89west, the wallet sends the remaining 5btc to a change address. on a desktop client, or webwallet this is just another address that you own, most times you wont even realise that it has happened as your balance just reduces by the amount you sent.
with a paper wallet the same thing happens, only you dont know the address that it was sent to. no one gets the coins, they are lost forever. if you know the secret ley used to create the original address it is possible you can trace them but I have no idea if you can access them.
safest and easiest option for everyone involved is to empty the wallet entirely into a desktop wallet you control and then spend them from there.
Also i think it is a good idea to split your btc up amongst many paper wallets, say 100btc in 10 wallets of 10btc each.

You assume a central bank is required because there has always been one for national currencies. There is absolutely no evidence that a single global currency NEEDS a central bank. 
You also assume bitcoin has to be the only game in town to be successful, dollars, yen, euro, pounds etc have coexisted for years no reason bitcoin cannot be one of many.

Yes I imagine there are some people who will sell as soon as they get their stake back, others may intend to but if the market is making good steady gains at the time may change their mind when the time comes.

There are 2 options, either use the electrum client or blockchain.info API. 
Electrum -  you copy in your master public key, the plug in then uses a new address for each order created from the master key,  which is unique to your electrum wallet. 
Blockchain API - You provide one address for all payments to be sent to. The API creates an intermediary address for the customer and the BTC is automatically forwarded to your chosen address. 
Very simple and easy to use.

Namecoin, whilst it is a derivative of bitcoin actually offers something new.
litecoin is just an amended bitcoin protocol released by people who missed out on being BTC early adopters.
I have seen theymos comment that PPCoin and freicoin actually offer alternative functionality to bitcoin.
Novacoin is pretty much a scam, loads of coins were pre-mined then paid to an exchange in order to get the coin listed on an exchange. They could dump these coins at anytime, pretty sure that loads of other pre-mine coins were kept by the creators also.
Bitcoin is the only one created and released by its creator on an even starting point for everyone.

Hey just read the thread and this looks good. What sort of customisation is available, i.e. I would like payments to be sent to my own wallet and not via bitpay.
My stock will not be available until next week however I will probably spend the weekend poking about on it and see what u can get up and running.
Providing it all goes well I may be able to assist you with the bounties you mention in your thread

A bitcoin based business can price in BTC without considering the exchange rate. See ASIC MINER mining equipment as an example. SD gets paid in and pays out bitcoin, i am sure that Eric found a host that accepted BTC,  so pricing it in BTC makes sense,  especially if you are long on bitcoin as Eric clearly is.

Not at all. One thing that an economics degree and reading about economic theory has taught me is that all economists think their school of thought is the only right one,  but given the opportunity to put theory into practice they inevitably fail when people don't respond the way they do in theoretical papers. No single school of thought has been able to successfully prevent the boom bust cycle that we find ourselves in. Bitcoin may not do that either but unless it becomes a global currency and continues with this level of volatility it cannot do much worse.

You limit order is set to below market rate so it executes immediately because the lowest you will sell for is the limit order amount. 
Sounds like you are trying to place a stop loss order so that it sells if the price drops to a certain figure none of the exchangeS support that feature as yet

Go to localbitcoins.com
Enter your postcode to find local sellers.
At the top of the page you will find people who will sell you coins for bank transfers.
Scroll down to find people who will sell you coins for cash face 2 face.
Email the sellers and make arrangements.
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:49:39
they offer an escrow service, seller puts BTC into an account on the site and starts a transaction, BTC goes into escrow, when buyer pays seller relases escrow into their localbitcoins account. transfer is immediate as it is account to account and not via the blockchain.
still potential to be scammed if you take bank transfer and they chargeback but cash trades are fine.

Yeah the reference that btce give you is too long for most accounts so cut off the crap at the beginning.

The account ID can just be sequential numbers, so 1, 2,  3 and 4 digit account numbers probably exist

because of the volatility of the price of bitcoin it is better for shareholders to have control of the coin, also they dont have to worry too much about security. holding onto 3 months worth of bitcoin earnings, maybe 60k btc, would be quite an attractive wallet for hackers.

as i have said, the technology behind it is sound, that for me makes it a good investment, if that breaks then bitcoin is worthless until then it will, in my mind, become an extension of the internet by opening up greater technological changes and eventually I would like to see a a situation where cryptographically signed "coins" act like a vote unique to an individual, giving people a greater say in decisions in their locality, remove it from the elected few and make people responsible for their own governing, 10 minutes a day of political admin wouldnt be too much to ask.

well with btc-e  and fybse @ $124 it is telling us that on exchanges where you can get money in and out of easily the price is less.
it is possible that the reason there are these big buys is because someone who sold their btc in april and had significant USD reserves on MtGox is now concerned about their liquidity and their ability to access that money. so by making these big buys they drag the price up, which in turn drags the price up on the other exchanges. then they transfer the btc to the other exchanges, splitting it up so as to not depress the price too much on one exchange and and also because the market depth on most exchanges could not support that level of selling.
this would also mean that you would have to sell it off slowly over a number of days, and the big buys have been about 5-7days apart recently.
if the whale bought btc all in one go he may cause someone else to sell off their coins, leaving him worse off, so by pushing the price up by about $10 a time he lessens the risk of that allowing him time to cash out his USD via a differnt exchange.

I think a lot of people do this, no idea why they don't implement it, perhaps it is too complex for the current exchanges but it would be a huge factor in limiting volatility.

Don't do this with someone else's money. If he wants to do it use his own cash. If BTC drops will he make up the difference when he returns the deposit? I presume he will cream off any gains that it makes. If he can cover the loss then it may be OK but really he should check the law governing deposit holding. In the UK at least there is a recognised scheme landlords have to use.

1) there are laws in place to deal with tax evasion, bitcoin makes it easier but that doesnt mean no tax is being paid. If you are getting paid in bitcoin you will the company paying you will be paying tax and so the taxman knows how much you were paid. There is also a blockchain of evidence proving payments if they really wanted to go crazy to prove how much you owe them.
2) it will take another 28 years, approx 2040 before all coins are mined. even if we did see the development of cold fusion and unlimited cheap energy that would not affect bitcoins. Energy use is a cost in mining but only a partial cost, time, effort, hardware all account for investments. So no it would not make a difference.

at the point it stabilises there will be a sell off from short-term speculators, dropping the price somewhat and hopefully steadying out over a longer period, offering both a store of wealth and a useable currency. of course where that happens, who knows. it might be at $1000 a coin or it might be $10000 a coin, if it is still in use by the time the last coin is mined it will have to be worth considerably more than where it is now to be able to function in a worldwide economy.

the economy is too young to make those sort of statements. satoshi dice share value dropped significantly in terms of btc during the meteoric rise this year,  but has been relatively unaffected by the subsequent drop in price. where AM shares have been building even though price is dropping. i think this is because as people see the value of their BTC falling, in terms of USD, they are investing it somehwere where they get a return (dividends) which increases their BTC holdings, offsetting some or all of the value lost to exchange rates. additionally if you do not want to add to the price dropping you can still do something with your BTC.

Bitcoin does not need a "silver" it is divisible by 8 places.
However there is no reason these currencies cannot exist side by side but LTC has little technical difference to BTC except for a modification to the mining method and faster confirmations. But faster confirmations does not mean more secure sooner.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:09:42
Do you have a source for that. As I understood it it is the time taken to reach the number of confirmations i.e. 1 hour = 6 conformations on btc but 1 hour on ltc will be say 30 confirmations but still only 1 hour.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:13:23

@_date: 2013-07-30 19:12:36
Sorry no,  I evidently missed out a point. You buy coins on Gox to sell to the buyer,  using the dollars that you have on gox. So you use your 525 to buy coins and sell them to the buyer at 108 per coin. 
You don't have to sell them on gox if you have a buyer ready,  buy on Virtex and sell at mtgox prices.  I do it like this so that I  an take advantage of the price differential and worry about finding buyers later. By not keeping it in btc I don't expose myself to the currency fluctuations, not with my trading money anyway.

I got mine in one of the first grouo buys. i bought 10 and sold 5 at £250 each on ebay as soon as i got them. the other 5 i ran for about 2 weeks, generating just under 1btc in that time. as soon as i saw friedcats post (within 30 mins of it being made) i listed my 5 remaining units on ebay at £160 ono, sold all of them for £150 a piece. after fees i could turn around and buy 25 at the new price and still have a few btc to spare, but after running them (setting it all up was worth the experience anyway as it gave me a reason to turn my raspberry pi into something other than a media server) and seeing the mining output, which will only reduce month on month, it seems to be a better idea to turn the btc into more asicminer shares, which will give a considerably better return than these erupters do. 
i am sure many early adopters must be feeling pretty sick right now, just glad i bought 10 and not just one or two otherwise i may have been stcuk with 2 overpriced toys.

1) - the person that mined/saved 10,000 coins since 2009 is being faily compensated. If it becomes worldwide and has a BTC/USD price of $10,000 then that person could have sold out at any stage along the way and made money, that they hold them until they reach their peak is no different to someone joining at this stage and buying 1000 bitcoins and holding them. The huge reward is there because there is a huge risk that they could be worthless at any point and that early adopter could have nothing for his trouble. Whereas the guy who buys 1000 now is buying them with the knowledge that they have been around for a while and the technology has been tested and there is more knowledge of what the market thinks of these coins. Thus his risk is reduced but so is his potential for reward.
2 - Bitcoin has been tested, the major fork that happened recently was a test of bitcoin and the developers and how quickly issues could be identified and resolved. Bitcoin passed that test. The one you mention is of exchanges, that is not a problem for bitcoin. If all the exchanges went down tomorrow, so would the price as demand dropped away. But bitcoin will still work. Bitcoin works at $1 or $1000. Bitcoins price might be set back a number of years but not the protocol, adoption may slowdown, but that would depend on the nature of the attack on the exchanges, government regulation then adoption is hurt but not because of bitcoin but regulation. Big difference between the concern being with the tech in question or the government's overreaching powers.
