So you don't own a television, drive a car, take flights or use computers or you do some of these and use proprietary software but like to take 'moral' stand against a kid who has CREATED something of use to people?

That bus you take has components that are governed by proprietary software, the computer you use does too unless you are making your own chips. I like open source too, I prefer it -- but I also recognise great things have and can come from proprietary.
You know what is immoral? Trying to dent or reshape the spirits of creativity in youth in hope that they will conform to your idea of morality.

What part of what he said do you find problematic?

Not if synthetic ETFs are eventually approved as they have been in all other asset classes.

Stop hoping and learn about markets, trading and capital preservation.

Actually men fk things up, women are better at creating good times...

That makes no sense, if you buy low, sell high and buy more low it's obviously a great decision.

And also did you even read what the quote was?

Unconstructive criticism is toxic. There is no shortage of that here. It's fine if you have some ideas of something to contribute otherwise...

Be a force for unity in your speech as you have been in your work. Together and only together, WE are Bitcoin.

I doubt that, think of how many it would take.

He runs Bodog, the Americans hounded him as a result. Education not ignorance will serve you better in the longer term.

Long on trend? In a bear market? Ok. I am a novice trader but one fund I am in hits about 80% positive trades and another I am in hits about 80% negative, they are both highly profitable funds but of course there is no 'one size fits all' trading style. It's certainly not flipping coins, TA works, admittedly not many people are any use at it, but combined with psychology timing the market is not as hard as it's made out to be by people who actually know what they are doing.

Yes, I wonder how many of them eat beef?

No, it wouldn't, miners have to shut down rigs when price falls below a certain threshold as it is no longer profitable to mine. This can vary greatly depending on location, power source and strategic goals. 
You can see when it happened recently when BTC dropped down to recent lows June 25-27.

Not in the case of Bitfinex, there is a futures market where they are split for you.
