The crisis has already come. GDP of UK, Germany and Mexico is hovering around 0%. So we won't avoid it but we can diminish its impact holding cryptos.

Everybody should do something regarding to their personal finances, it's still a good time to do so.

Definitelly BTC is to stay  here. We can buy BTC on exchanges or earn other cryptos and then convert them in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is already accepted in many stores throughout the world.

Digital revolution in terms of cryptos are shaping our world monetary system into something more sustainable and fair by avoiding the intervention of central banks which are causing a lot of harm to global economy.

Citizens of many countries need to get ready for upcoming recession times and if the current monetary system has default, it's time to start adopting cryptos.

You are 100% right. Even if we are still at the stage of early adopters, the advantage is to get Bitcoin at affordable price because it's price outlook stands over 100,000 USD in few years.

I believe that BTC is a great protection for investment portfolio for the recession which has already come, a lot of economic indicators are showing it already; the governments of course won't tell us on time what is happening.

100% agree. People in many countries start to get Bitcoin. Especially the countries where a strong economic crises are being lived, have started adopted cryptos such as Argentina or Venezuela.

I think it's very hard to handle it. I think our countries aren't heading only to Recession but a second world great Depression, which will have to reform our monetary system, which has proven being inefficient.

I think it's good to have in any investment portfolio to protect us as efficiently as possible. If you are a crypto holder, BTC is a must to be there.

It's a very good investment on the long run. Actually in the magazine Forbes, Bitcoin has been considered as the best investment of this century. Imagine the value of 30 USD pizza which cost 10,000 BTC in 2011, today - multiply 10,000 X8,200 = 82,000,000 USD.
