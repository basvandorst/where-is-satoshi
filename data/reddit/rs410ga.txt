Informative video and may I add that, in a world that seems to be filled with poster boys, it's refreshing to see a poster gal.

I remember when I first found out about tether...I made it to the part where it was pegged to the USD and then quit reading and bought more bitcoin

Price is reflective of demand and adoption so regardless of whether you're in it to make a quick buck or to change the world, rising demand is exciting.

My wife knows that I have some bitcoin...she's as interested in it as I am her fingernail polish collection.

I wish they wouldn't require Authy to sign up!  I contacted their support about it and they said I can disable Authy once I create an account...then why the f*** do I need Authy to create the account!?!?!?!

It's a little work but I buy things with my bitcoins and then resell them for dollars.

Some would consider it a huge risk to accept the US dollar or any other fiat currency.

It's a rabbit hole man.  The more secure your assets are, the less usable your assets are.
It sounds like you've done a decent amount of research but having been down a similar road myself, I'd recommend breaking down and buying the Ledger wallet.  There's a certain wave of relief that passes over once you transfer your funds to a hardware wallet and throw your handwritten seed into a fireproof safe.
As for passwords...Keepass
