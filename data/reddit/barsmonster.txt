Let's see how it goes after halving hits BCH :-)

I just got BTC withdraw from them with no issues and very quick. Must be BCC technical issues.

Well, that's the difference of taking 11% nearly risk-free and doing some trading which is by definition is risky. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:01:38
No trust in cryptocurrencies will be harmed. It is quite obvious for everyone that 3-5% of total SHA256 hashrate is very vulnerable. There is no trust in 3% from the beginning.

It could be too late...
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:36:23
ok, I am first.
PS. I already lost 1000$ bet in similar deal 3 years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:33:49
Hurry up. It works. Just finished that.

Anyone who owned (with private keys) BTC before fork - got same amount of "Bitcoin Cash"/"Bcash"/"BCC" whatever you want to call it. You can sell this forked coin on exchange for more BTC. No fiat involved.

Well, dollar hyperinflation to kill debt overload is a possibility. In this case 1M bitcoins are also a viable possibility.

Also, the end result of this expedited mining is that they reach next halving faster, and for 0.5-1 years they will be significantly less profitable to mine. 
But that is still ~1-1.5 years ahead of us at this expedited rate, if this all will live long enough to see this wall at the end of the tunnel...

For BTC withdrawals - not that I am aware of. 
updated: Removed disinformation about fiat.

On hitBTC deposits are working just fine. Could take ~12 hours. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:36:22
I want it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:35:21
If you doing it too slow you are risking selling these for 0.001 BTC :-)
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:42:27
This also means BCH hits halving much faster... 
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:14:21
Your concern is valid. I am surprised noone yet tried to rape BCH using 51%. It's so easy after retarget and 12 hours of idle. Someone just need to silently mine some 4-5 blocks, and invalidate bunch of transactions going through exchanges which will ruin the trust. 25 blocks lead will make it much more efficient.
Cost of this 51% attack could be repaid by increased capitalization of only 1 Bitcoin left. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:05:18
Some exchanges require you to move balance to "trading balance" before you can trade... You did that? 
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:53:51
Their website clearly says 28nm. Anyway, we cannot say "uses xx nm" until it's shipped and confirmed. :-)

I would be happy to do BFL, I just need the chip :-) I was asking on bitcoin forums, avalon &amp; bitfury responded, BFL didn't :-(
