because governments and central banks will take actions to prevent it. They will do
so for two reasons. One is to protect the seigniorage revenues that they obtain from the
ability to almost costlessly create money. The second is to retain the ability to implement
interest policies to affect their domestic economies. Governments would lose the ability to
do either or both of these under the Bitcoin standard.

It's not about what's cheapest, this is human life and well-being, the most precious thing we have. It's about offering the best care to the entire population. And the best way to do that is by a government funded national health service. On the side, private practices can and should exist to service self funded / insured individuals. This dual natured approach serves everyone, it's not perfect but it's the best I've seen.

True, but it's also a bluff to say you're going to liquidate your holdings. If you do and a deal is struck the price could rise and you'd be out of pocket.

You do need to get some sleep mate, you're clearly stressed out. I recommend meditation.
I'm actually a dual citizen, Canadian-uk so I know both systems. You can't do a like for like comparison because the scales, budgets, and numbers are different. The Canadian healthcare system is better because it's under less demand. But the uks dual public private system works well under heavy load. 
Your mom could be seen quickly if she was going private. Or if not, she'd be seen to the best of the public's capacity. That's the best we can do. Advocating a pure private system is not the answer, look at the U.S.

great post. in full agreement, being nice and working together would be optimal. but i'm also of the opinion that in evolutionary terms, there can be no wrong - the entity either evolves or dies - neither is a problem, it just is.

I agree it is tortuous. Part of me even doubts we'll even see a correction in our lifetimes. I picture myself on my death bed 50 years from now and bitcoin finally goes to the moon...

or they could raise interest rates slowly and everything will be "fine"
it's an overly dramatic quote. bitcoin is the more radical experiment being the most advanced money to date.

mike, as usual - you're exactly right. but it's the way you come across that ruffles feathers. whenever i watch gavin speak, i'm so impressed with his demeanor - he's as smooth as silk.
code is the subject and you behave like an algorithm, but you'll never win hearts that way. this is as much a political game. have a read of 'how to win friends and influence people'.
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:52:38
for sure, some are a lost cause.
let's not jump to conspiracy theories. the simplest explanation is usually correct, and imo that is: everybody's got an interest in bitcoin's success, and therefore an opinion. it just so happens that all these opinions have led to an actionless dead end.
let them write their letter and attempt to deliver a solution. and let XT be an alternative implementation. we shall see evolution in action.

There's a few things that need to happen before the flood gates open. Bitcoin has to scale. Apps for the public need to be built and in demand. Once people need to use bitcoin, then we'll have the potential for a flood. At the moment it's just splashing in the bathtub.

To be fair, you're right. Hence bitcoin, decentralized, trustless money. Its development is going through an evolutionary phase. Survival of the fittest isn't pretty, but that's life.

I don't think the future can be predicted. We can shape it today though, and in my opinion there's still a lot of positive progress (if also negativity).
