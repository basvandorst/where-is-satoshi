120,000? Shit! That's a lot! I would make 120,000 paper wallets, fill a pool, and swim in it!

You could give your regular tip + these.

Impressive, and yea, magic beans. We're living in a weird future.
I'll be able to tell my grandkids (or failing that, the kids who volunteer at my old-folks home) that I once paid a month's rent with money from a crypto based off a dog meme.

One day we might be saying the same thing about *only* $20,000 per BTC.

Successful traders wipe their ass with $50k cars. (they have big assholes)

I don't hate my bank, my bank helped me buy bitcoin.

If a few hundred million, or billion was put into Bitcoin how much would BTC go up. How much money would you make selling it on the way up, and then on the way down.
I don't think you would lose much, but the panic sell would be massive.

What about ?

Step 2: Drive up price
Step 3: Wait for high price
Step 4: Start selling, sell more, SELL MORE!
Step 5: Panic
Step 6: Sell even more, crash it even harder
Step 7: Bitcoin crashes to $1

Notice the trend though?

If you don't mind spending the time the best strategy is just keep doubling your bet until you win.
100, lose, 200, lose, 400, win 800 (profit of 100)
100, lose, 200, lose, 400, lose, 800, lose, 1600, lose, 3200, win 6400 (profit of 100)
100, win 200
100, lose, 200, win 400

Wow, I absolutely can't believe anyone is buying at this point, strongly considering selling ;) Its gonna go down, seeing allot of buy orders between 55-60 ;)
... This is just as silly as what you posted.

How do those words even make sense with regards to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:49:04
Where can I buy a bitcoin for $100?
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:41:15
When are you releasing the wallet so I can start mining?

People fucking love this picture. I see it posted at least twice a day. I'll downvote it every time.

My friend Wesley Snipes said I don't have to pay taxes on bitcoin revenue.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:06:53
You win some, you lose some. Luckily you only lost something like $2.

I am really surprised by all the millionaires and billionaires who die. If I had all that money I would get together with my rich friends and spend all our money on immortality. Who knows, maybe they are. If they are I hope they share some with us. Maybe we could be their pets (we'd make **great** pets).
@_date: 2013-03-31 03:41:32
How could I lose it?
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:12:58
DAMN! Now I'm scared of that too.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:10:50
Yes, but buying a huge amount would make other join in the frenzy. Selling a huge amount would plummet it in just as frenzied manner.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:10:42
I don't know where to sell.
@_date: 2013-07-09 04:42:18
You should check back on this thread in 6 months and either laugh or cry. :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:16:37
So people who say a bitcoin has a fundamental price of 1,000,000 USD should keep buying until it reaches that height? :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:07:17
Still a value for most Humble Bundles at $40.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:10:01
Exactly, they would skyrocket the price. But they would also buy up so much BTC that they could later sell it off crashing it.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:08:31
If you lost 18,000 I assume you have at least that much, assuming the casino isn't fixed you should win a 50/50 chance bet eventually.
