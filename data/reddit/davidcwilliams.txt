When a miner transmits the information for a solved block, what is to prevent the first receiver of that information retransmitting it as their own? For that matter, what is the incentive for the receivers to retransmit the information if they don't benefit at all?

Okay, but Bitcoin is not a penny stock. This is a new type of asset, possibly the best type of asset, and many people saw that, and invested.
I will give you that if they invested in the last year, then they are likely not in the group I describe, and are more likely in the group you describe.

I can't remember, what's the drop rate for this one? Meaning if I hold 1btc, how much bcd do I have?

My biggest concern with LN is the sheer amount of friction involved *even if everything goes according to plan*. So, in order to use the LN, I need to preload less than 0.5btc into a wallet of sorts where I can then spend it... where?With other people who are set up and ready to run this off-chain software? Will this be looked at by people as Bitcoin 2.0? Maybe I am having problem envisioning exactly how this will organically grow. I mean I'm *hoping like hell* it's legit, because Bitcoin-as-a-currency absolutely depends on it, but I have my doubts about it being the thing that we'll all be using in 3 years. Can you maybe point me in the direction of whatever you read/watched that has you convinced?
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:02:00

I don't think it would matter. I'm an atheist and would be honored to be called Bitcoin Jesus. It has nothing to do with a belief in god, or christianity. It is a tongue-in-cheek joke about proselytizing, and spreading the good news of Bitcoin.

Umm, I wasn’t talking about the date, I was talking about the spelling of the word ‘time’. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:43:44
Yeah, do we *really* think gold is worth $1300 an ounce? I mean on what grounds is it worth that? People only want it because it goes up in value. It doesn’t have any utility outside of very niche use cases. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:35:45
lol fair enough. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:29:15
yeah, it's not. How do we fix that?
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:11:19
Then, *all* currencies are a means to get wealth, and not the wealth itself... right?
So having $100,000,000 in the bank means that I have *a lot* of "means to get wealth", but not the wealth itself.
Got it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:39:37
I love this answer.
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:39:08
Think about what you’re saying. Let’s say that hypothetically, you can always buy or sell as much of whatever security you want. Let’s say you buy 100 shares at $1 each. The price falls to $0.85. Now if you think the stock is going to fall to $0.80, then you will save $5 by selling now. If you think the stock will rise to $0.95, then holding is the exact same thing as selling all 100 shares, and then buying all 100 shares right back. 
In other words, make the best decision you can at the time with the information you have. Don’t worry about “selling at a loss” or “booking a win”. It’s a waste of your time, counter-productive, and meaningless.

@_date: 2018-01-17 08:36:46
I’m sure the guy fashioning a necklace out of his worthless gold will feel great about spending $1300 for the metal. If your point is, “well, gold is physical, *and shiny*”, then okay. I can’t argue with that. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:25:20
But that's not how the *stock* is traded. It's traded based on supply and demand. People buy, so they can sell to someone else. Well, except for Warren Buffet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:03:41
Thanks! I honestly assumed there would be so much more to it. What with technical analysis and what-not.

Not with Lightning.
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:53:08


What are you talking about? Why do you think you'd have to pay thousands of dollars in transaction fees to transfer your coins to another exchange?
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:18:37
That’s another conversation. But yes.
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:53:29
Just give us the chance to opt out of that shit. I would gladly give up the right to use public roads, fire department services, and send my kids to public schools, in exchange for being tax exempt. Do you know why that's not offered? Because I'm not alone. There are millions of us. The system only 'works' because of force.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:40:26
The difference is, it's very easy to search someone's house or their person for gold coins... it's next to impossible to prove that someone controls Bitcoin, *especially* if they don't want you to know.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:06:31

@_date: 2019-07-13 10:04:59
Yeah, fair enough. I didn’t mean that you weren’t justified, I was explaining the scope of my response.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:11:58
I mean that bubbles can form anywhere. This time it was in real estate. Fractional lending and a continued increase of the money supply means all of that money has to find a home. If your money is sound, these problems go away.

@_date: 2019-07-30 12:46:54


Well, you're going to have to when you want to make blanket statements like 'if you make money'. What exactly does that mean? If I held Bitcoin in Zimbabwe for the last 5 years, is the government entitled to half of it because they printed themselves into oblivion?

well so do I...
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:02:41
The point is, my buying power didn't change, there is simply more money in the system, no one should be taxed for that.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:30:08
Hang on. Concealment is not the issue. The issue is if you are attacked, your wealth is lost to the first person able to pry the gold bar from your fanny-pack. Not only can your private keys be carried invisibly, but should you be killed while crossing the road, your wealth does not fall to the first person to find your body.

True. The purpose may have been to ensure that no one could access the box alone, take something out (or put something it) without the others being present. A destroyed safe is easier to figure out who to question.

The problem is, I told everyone I know how many I had *years* ago, now what do I do...
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:30:10
Interesting, I didn't know there would be any limitation on the amount, but after thinking about it, of course that would true. I like the idea of parking my bitcoin where it can earn interest as a relay, rather than having it sit in cold storage. I imagine that will be its own sort of 'cold war' once the time comes. Those who are able to set aside what will by then be a *substantial* amount of money to act as a 'node' or 'relay' or whatever they're calling it. It could even be looked at then as getting together enough money to start a business!
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:03:43
omg, nice catch. How are you not at the top?
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:38:16

That's my plan. I might have to wait a few years for LN, but that's my plan.
@_date: 2019-07-13 10:10:10
Ironically no. It’s an open market that will *best* determine price... price of products, labor, interest, and even the money itself. When you let a person with a gun dictate what someone will be compensated for exchanging any of these. You distort value. Furthermore if the money isn’t sound (as in it doesn’t have properties that good money does), then the entire market suffers, as trade is now inherently lass efficient.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:11:27
If the price keeps moving like this, we’re going to have an armed entourage. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:25:34
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:23:48
You’re right, ’bits’ sounds better than ‘satoshi’ (and matches the brand name - Bitcoin is made up of bits), but I don’t wanna have to do this all over again in 6 years. So now that we’re hitting the mainstream, let’s simply rename our beloved satoshi to bits right now, at some point drop the decimal altogether, and simply use ‘bits’ for pricing *everything*. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:31:39
This should be the top. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:29:03

Honest question: instead of 'suggesting' this stuff, why not simply make Bitcoin only allow new addresses to be segwit addresses as of, I don't know... June 1, 2018. Sort of a soft-fork into usability again.

Bitcoin is the first crypto-currency. 
It has never been hacked or exploited.
It has (and will always have) the longest blockchain, going back further than any other crypto-currency. 
Limited supply.

No, that’s assuming a 1:1 parity for all of his buying and selling. In reality, they were likely all different people.

oh, okay, fair enough!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:13:47
I like that!
...or if we kept the 'bits'...
What if when referring to 'Bitcoin' or 'BTC' we put the decimal 8 places to the left like this: 1.00000000 but when we are referring to  the smallest unit, we designate it like this: 980,567bt  or  4,587bt  or  7,531,544bt... still keeping the branding the same. I suppose 980,567sat  and  4,587sat  and 7,531,544sat works the same way.... just anything to get rid of that decimal and get back to whole numbers.

There is no advantage to buying in blocks. Buying in blocks, or all at once has no effect on an anything, precisely *because* we have no way of knowing if the price will move up or down in the short term. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:44:43
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:23:29
Yes, spreading out your buys decreases standard deviation (or fluctuation)... *but there is no advantage in doing so*. If you buy all at once, you stand an equally-likely chance of buying on a dip as you do buying on a peak. Spreading them out, simply breaks the one time buy into several, each of which have the same probability as the first. Therefore, if you'd like your purchase price to be closer to the average price for that period, by all means Dollar Cost Average 'til your heart's content. My point is there is no *advantage* in doing so.

That’s interesting. One of things I was happy about was that having futures allowed big investors to put big more net into Bitcoin and then protect themselves with a bottom out insurance. I’m disappointed to find out that this isn’t the case.

...what did he do? I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:13:12
Yeah, ok. I did say that 'it made no difference' when countering that there was an *advantage* to using Dollar Cost Averaging, where I took 'advantage' to mean; "Realize profits on average that would otherwise be lost". If we are to include "decreasing the risk of investing all of your money at a peak", then sure, I will concede that there are countless reasons for doing something a certain way that some people may prefer, if *you* will concede that there is no increase in average gains by using Dollar Cost Averaging.

I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:23:32
I upvoted your comment because you won me with “the ship is still being built!”, but I object to two of your other points. 
1. Please don’t make the mistake in dismissing wealthy people as bad people. If you do believe that, please tell us why. 
2. You must realize that this great “shifting of wealth” is temporary. Assuming all good things occur for Bitcoin, nothing prevents innovative, cunning, resourceful, investors, entrepreneurs, and just plain-old businessmen from becoming the 1% all over again. And there’s nothing wrong with that. The difference is, this time we will have sound money. That’s it. But the importance and impact of sound money can not be overstated.

Two questions:
1. If everyone adopted SegWit right now, how would that effect the fees and tx time?
2. Isn't someone who is recommending a block size increase on probably simply wanting larger blocks on Bitcoin? Wouldn't a person from instead be arguing for using bcash?

Unfortunately, the only way you could do what you’re describing would be to know the price movements ahead of time. If the movement is random, you decrease your standard deviation, but you do not increase your expected value.

My problem with these sorts of solutions is the "if I die" scenario. I would want *all* off my Bitcoin to be passed to my family.

@_date: 2017-12-22 11:26:50
Fuck these haters. Let's look at the possibilities you were facing at the time. 
1. You take out a loan of 10k and put all of it in Bitcoin. Bitcoin goes up a little over time, and you cover your loan costs, so nothing gained, nothing lost. 
2. You take out a loan of 10k and put it all in Bitcoin. Bitcoin sags a little and never really takes off ever again. You lose a little money, and you've got loan costs, so, not great, but losses are still under 5k. 
3. You take out a loan of 10k and put it all in Bitcoin. Bitcoin falls through the floor, all the haters are finally right this time, and it never recovers to prices over 2k ever, ever again. You lose 8k, plus the cost of your loan, so you're out around 10k... definitely not good, but not a life-changing loss, and definitely manageable with any sort of regular income.
4. You take out a loan of 10k and put it all in Bitcoin. Bitcoin shoots up well past 20k, 40k, 80k, 200k, and 500k in the weeks, months, years, and decades following your very risky investment, just like half the country said it would after absolutely unprecedented growth. When we all thought 'Holy shit, it's all happening!! It's all happening!!'. You're life is forever changed, you are forever known as a bad-ass to everyone you ever come in contact with, and are able to do for any and everyone you love and care about, including parents, friends, children and spouse. You get to be the guy who saw an opportunity, and instead of sitting on his ass and talking about it, you actually did something about it.
5. You sit in your car parked outside of your credit union, debating whether to even get out... and eventually talk yourself out of doing what you know is terribly risky. You go home, eat dinner, drink a few beers, play some Rocket League, and go to sleep. And in the coming weeks, months, and years, Bitcoin does... any of the above.
Now which move is the right one??
And another thing, every one of these assholes that are shitting on you for taking a chance *are taking the exact same risks by leaving their money in Bitcoin*. Every 'hodler' that put 5 or 10 percent of their money in Bitcoin back when it was $100 are now *waaaay* over-extended, but are holding because they believe that Bitcoin is the best place for their money. I know people with 60, 70 and 80 percent of their net worth sitting in bitcoin. Every day they *don't* sell is another day that they continue to take *enormous* risk.
You took a chance, and these people can go fuck themselves.

Oh, it's a currency. Just a crappy one for right now. But stability is the least important tenant in my opinion. Most important?
1. Transaction fees. It can't cost me $4 to pay for coffee. And no merchant can afford to pay the fees for their customers at that cost.
2. Acceptance. Yeah, losing Steam is bad news, but it demonstrates the real problem (the fees). If the fees are low (or a *percentage* of the transaction amount), pricing can be done automatically, so fluctuation in value really isn't a big deal. Either of those happen, you'll see a whoooole lot more companies and businesses accepting Bitcoin. Especially now that it's exploded and is on the news every day.

I don't know what you're talking about. Even if any of what you said mattered, you still can't assign value based on physical properties of mass, or chemical make-up. Value is *always* subjective. If I want a frying pan, an old Beatle's album, or sex with a local prostitute. Those prices will be set based on supply and demand of those involved. Nothing stupid about it. And the exact opposite of arbitrary.


No one 'says' it. It's not decreed. The frying pan *is* worth 94 Whizbangs when it is traded for that many.

Feel like your answer is the correct one, but really wish the others were right.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:33:10
If what you are saying is true, it needs to be written up (explaining it well), and it needs to be a sticky that others can be linked to.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:32:29
Yeah, I’ve had a few of my comments removed where I was discussing fees. Like, that’s it. I was discussing fees. My comment was removed, and some random user caught it and messaged me. Weird. I mean I get not wanting to scare off new users, we are in the middle of a product war, but I wish mods had to ‘sign off’ on each other’s deletions, and a notification at least informing you that one of your comments was removed (why it was removed would be great) would be appreciated.

It's simply not true... even if there were only 1,000,000 Bitcoin, and they were non-divisible, Bitcoin will be spent by those who have something in front of them worth parting with a bitcoin for.
Hodl actually affect the market very little.

eehh... if you grandfather left you a few bars of gold worth 2.8 million one day and 1.96 million the next because of wild fluctuation, your life is completely different. You don't have to sell the gold and collect the USD for your life to be completely different.
If that were true, then you could say that even though you're walking around with a million dollars in your checking account, you don't know the real value until you buy something.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:16:41
That's a really cool concept... but... isn't that a crime? I mean, once they decrypt it, won't what they're reading allow them to arrest you for threatening the President?

Yes, just like every other exchange, and every other situation where you do not control the private keys.

Ahh, okay. Thanks for the explanation.

Okay, I'll go with that. But I prefer a less emotional assessment when we promote Bitcoin, because I think that the problems that it solves are tangible, and not idealistic.
@_date: 2018-08-05 17:34:47
Honest question; are you envisioning a transaction-free world that the lightning network will provide? Because I love that each bitcoin can be broken into 100,000,000 pieces, but how useful is that if it takes 1000 satoshi ($0.07 at today's prices) in order to spend any?
And even the lightning network will have fees will it not?
@_date: 2018-08-31 02:43:48
I get where you're coming from.
I have spent a *lot* of time thinking about how to best back up a word seed, while also not having something that can be stolen either by a family member in your home, or a stereo-typical thief who is able to compromise your safe while you are at work.
I have found no good solution.
May I ask how you would reconstruct your word seed, (should you forget) if you don't know the order either? For that matter, what if one of your relatives dies, or decides to hold one of your words hostage once Bitcoin's price goes to $100,000?
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:39:07
I hope they do that! What pieces of shit. Now trying to sell the domain for 25btc.

There's nothing wrong with banks. You're problem is with the Federal Reserve, and fractional lending. Look into it.

I was politely mocking the original person who made the argument that it was a 'scam that was incoming' and also typed it out that way.

It probably had nothing to do with them, but a law or a regulation that they have to, or have decided to, cooperate with or abide by.
Ridiculous all the same.
My story: Wanted to close a small business account. Was told over the phone that she could *initiate* the closing of the account, but that I would have to wait 24 hours *and then call back to ask to have it closed again*. I politely asked: "Why? This is an internal operation on *your* computers is it not?" She didn't have an answer, I honestly don't think she knew. It did make working with Bitcoin seem very futuristic by comparison.

It *isn't* my friend. I'm sorry. All it does is decrease standard deviation. It doesn't increase your expected value.

Would you also say that if it starts out as open source, but has to run on a closed platform like iOS, that it too should not be used?

Allowing for a possibility, is not the same thing as stating that that’s what will happen. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 09:21:55
That's what I thought. I was considering moving all of my bitcoin to Bread wallet because I was tired of paper wallets and loved the idea of going completely 'cloud'. But despite hearing about how many people are carrying around millions worth of Bitcoin on bread wallet... I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I couldn't transfer all that I have to a wallet that could have a single line of code sending back everyone's private keys to their servers. So I finally went with Electrum on Tails. Not the most convenient solution (I can't access my Bitcoin when mobile) but it's one that I can live with without excessive worry.
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:35:26
Did you see this? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:05:04
ehh... could simply be that the web designer doesn't have that information yet. We'll see.
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:36:27
No, I think he's saying the miner's fee was $0.20, but they marked up the price of the bitcoin itself by about 6.19%.
@_date: 2014-10-03 05:00:46
From a legal standpoint, sure. My point is, someone buying pot from someone online with bitcoin harms no one, and it is inappropriate to classify it in the same way as crimes such as terrorism.
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:17:37
Ummm.. I don't use exchanges... why do you?
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:17:00


Not necessarily.
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:42:29
I sold my bch as soon as I could.
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:34:44
Exactly... no one knew. Shit could have hit $45,000 or more on that run up... I have no regrets.
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:02:02
Assuming a lot. My friends mocked me for not selling, and haven’t rebought. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:29:34
I knew it. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:23:40
Yes, obviously. They also hold zero Bitcoin.

You don't need an outcome to be certain to make the statement I did.

That's a terrible analogy. All of the entire stock market is not in the same space. Amazon to Walmart to Target would be a better analogy. Course, you wouldn't have a point then.

@_date: 2018-05-04 12:07:00
No it isn't.
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:28:14
Yeah, I honestly think we saw the bottom at $5800. We have a *lot* more true believers in the space now.

@_date: 2018-05-11 05:24:38
I’m using Electrum on Tails with a persistent volume that is only online when accessing that Bitcoin. I have a Bread wallet for everyday, but using Tails as a sort of ‘warm storage’. What do you think of that?
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:55:21
I believe it’s just the opposite. It’s when the highs and lows converge to a wedge that we generally see breakouts.

Exactly. People keep asking when I'll sell. I say, I'll sell when I can spend it everywhere.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:55:33
Thank you. I will. What's your opinion of TA?
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:04:10


Greed is not the problem in any system. And even if it was, what is there to do about it? The problem is fractional lending, and an endless supply of new money.
That is why Bitcoin is better.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:40:20
DCA isn't a strategy, unless your strategy is to simply decrease standard deviation. If that's your goal, great, no harm done. If you think it increases your expected value, it does not.
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:08:53
Exactly. This is so frustrating to have people come to me with this crap today. I said "I'm not interested in an argument from authority. Warren Buffet will have to play by the same rules as everybody else. If you've got a good argument for why Bitcoin is crap, I'll listen. Otherwise, shut the hell up."
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:36:02
I've talked to him quite a bit about it... if it isn't he's been lying to me.

Wow, I don't have any idea what that is or how it would work. Thanks though.
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:36:18
Okay, that was *way* too reasoned and balanced... 
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:42:20
Ohmygod... get over yourself. All they're saying is to keep the faith, and not panic sell at the first sight of a drop. As if this tiny, tiny little corner of the Bitcoin market could affect a damn thing anyway.

Satoshi Nakamoto broke years of silence- wait, what? That happened? Sorry, not up to speed on the events.
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:46:16
Okay, this is my last comment. I'm going to try to explain this one more time. 
Because someone has the option to do something does not mean that they will. In this example, we are discussing people selling their Bitcoin at 15k, but failing to buy back in at a lower price due to uncertainty with regard to Bitcoin's long-term viability and price. In other words, if Bitcoin succeeds, selling at 15k might turn out to be a decision they regret, because they never bought back in.
Good day.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:23:50

Been trying to do that... followed 3 different guides for installing GnuPG with a front-end kgpg I think? The closest I've gotten was being able to sha256sum the files, but that doesn't verify the signatures... finally ran the command line 'gpg --verify adam.asc Wasabi-1.1.1.deb' and got an unknown error of some kind. Real fun. Been at this for 3 hours now.

@_date: 2019-03-29 07:43:23
What you're not factoring into your analysis is that the fact that the credit card payment is reversible, *increases* the risk of fraud, and therefore increases the cost of the fridge.
@_date: 2019-03-25 11:45:40
How does Bitcoin succeed in the long run if this is true?
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:31:47
This is my favorite by far.
@_date: 2019-03-23 09:45:16
Thank you transfer, I think we all understood that from the beginning. I believe the confusion stemmed from my interpretation of  his comment to one that was critical of op. I thought he was saying that Bitcoin would never work as a world currency because wasn't enough to go around. I explained that to him and we called it a day.
@_date: 2019-03-01 11:35:22
Oh wow, Hi Nopara73! I just downloaded your PGPkey. I've been trying to figure out how to verify Wasabi-1.1.1.deb for the past 3 hours. Proficient in linux I am not...  ;(
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:08:30
Well who the hell cares? There aren't any actual 'Bitcoin' at the protocol level anyway. It's *all* satoshi.
@_date: 2019-03-22 10:50:08
It would simply mean that each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100,000,000 pieces, and each satoshi can be broken down into 100,00,000 pieces *too*.
@_date: 2019-03-04 10:02:16
Ohhh, now that’s a good point.
Yeah, I’m messing around with hand-written examples, and the best I can come up with is:
amount dash s
But even that can be confused with ‘minus five’. 
Yeah, forget what I said, we definitely need a symbol. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 11:59:44
Yeah, dead again. Why the hell are you here?
@_date: 2019-03-01 03:08:51
What does that have to do with anything?
@_date: 2019-03-14 19:55:56
Yeah, any day now. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 02:21:39
Way to miss the point. Dominance does not equal trust.
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:00:31
Sweet, I like to cook!
@_date: 2019-03-29 07:48:38
I've decided to make it my reddit's existence to continue to ask the obvious to you people: WHY ARE YOU HERE??
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:40:47
You are 100% wrong. It is not a lie of omission. Show me a savings account where I can withdraw my funds at any time, and also keep pace with inflation. They don’t exist. 
And a CD is not an account, it’s a *loan*. Hence the penalty for pulling your money early. 
Actually, savings accounts are loans too, but that’s another conversation. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 09:05:53
Wasabi Wallet thank you very much. I’ll keep the network effect of the first distributed cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:26:19
This is precisely what happened when users were able to set their own miner fee...
@_date: 2019-03-01 05:30:17
You're comment is terrible. Just terrible.
To OP; if you want to hold or spend Bitcoin, that's great. If that's not for you, *just accepting it* does a world of good for Bitcoin. Thank you for considering it!
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:01:44
Soon 1 Bitcoin will equal 1 satoshi? You must be new.
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:53:08
In the process of setting up my full node. Can you link me to the guide you followed for your lightning implementation?
@_date: 2019-03-14 06:20:51
My point is, we don't get to 2000tx/sec with a blockchain size that most individuals can operate, by increasing block size. We get there by scaling. You want crypto to be an option when checking out at Amazon? You have to compete with the current *user* experience. For libertarians and crypto enthusiasts, well, we're already sold on 'sound money'. The average user wants safety and convenience. How do we get them on board?
I'll tell you.
We get them on board by going after small-to-medium businesses that are currently spending 3-4% each month in order to accept credit cards. We show them that they can start accepting Bitcoin *right now* by adding creating an account 'here', adding these few lines of code 'here', or by downloading 'this app here'.
Once the merchants experience the benefits of holding, the speed and ease of use. Some of them will begin to *prefer* Bitcoin over credit cards, and more importantly USD. Once that happens, and they offer discounts or incentives to those paying with Bitcoin, we're on our way.
It is ridiculous to think that everyone should be running a lnd-enabled full-node, and that that's only way to move forward. Custodial wallets are not ideal, but this is the real world. Shit *will* happen on exchanges, shit *will* happen at Bitcoin Banks and Lending Networks. So what? At least we have sound money.
This should be our strategy going forward.
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:01:46
Did you mean to respond to OP?
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:05:10
What a piece of shit. State your fucking intentions upfront so i can decide if I want to waste 5 minutes of my life being misled by a Bcasher who offers no crypto scaling solution whatsoever, but bashes the most promising scalable solution (while not perfect) that has been presented yet? Do these people seriously think that on-chain crypto can compete with Visa's 1700 tx/sec with... 7 tx/sec?? I'm actually asking! What the fuck are they thinking?
@_date: 2019-03-04 07:27:06
Yeah, we’re on the same page. The only issue I see there is that it can sometimes look like seconds. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:15:11
It's not. It's cringy af... and it makes the entire lot of us appear to have no understanding of the roles that banks currently play, or the role that they have played throughout history. It's ignorant, and lame.
This is coming from someone who's held Bitcoin since 2013, and developed borderless, gold-backed digital money since 2006.
Bankers aren't your enemy, and they never were. The problem is unsound money that they along with anyone else who has the power, will create out of thin air. If *you* had the power, you would create money out of thin air.
That, is why Bitcoin is great. Because it delivers the promise of gold, but for the digital age and beyond.
Bitcoin is bigger than a war with banks.
@_date: 2019-03-16 09:10:05
@_date: 2019-03-25 21:29:43
I'm so torn on this issue. I want usability, but also think the fact that they are so forward-thinking took balls, and in a sense, they are building the future we all say we want.
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:33:40
No, actually, it can't happen at all. That's like saying that 1 Byte might one day equal 1 Bit.
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:02:17
Honestly *love* the one on the right.
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:07:43
...I'm surrounded by children.
@_date: 2019-03-05 10:35:59
@_date: 2019-03-22 10:45:44
You realize Bitcoin can be broken down into pieces as small as we want, right?
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:04:49
@_date: 2019-03-08 04:51:09
Awesome, thank you, I will!
@_date: 2019-03-04 07:26:16
Now *that’s* nice!
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:16:16
If we were using gold coins to buy heroin, we would do the same thing. Any currency fluctuates against any other... Bitcoin just does it more... for now.
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:30:03
Good answer. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:18:13
The difference now, is, you can't be searched and found with Bitcoin on your person.
@_date: 2019-11-24 10:10:18
Aaaand there it is. I say a bunch of stuff you don’t like, and now my examples are terrible and what I say is just plain ignorant.
Good game.
@_date: 2019-03-22 05:43:53
What does this mean for someone (me) who’s running a full node?
@_date: 2019-03-08 09:29:56
Okay, this is what I did:
To Build on Ubuntu
OS version: Ubuntu 15.10 or above
Get dependencies:
 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y \
    autoconf automake build-essential git libtool libgmp-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev python python3 net-tools zlib1g-dev libsodium-dev \
    libbase58-dev
If you don't have Bitcoin installed locally you'll need to install that as well:
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y bitcoind
For development or running tests, get additional dependencies:
    sudo apt-get install -y asciidoc valgrind python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install -r tests/requirements.txt
Clone lightning:
    git clone 
    cd lightning
Build lightning:
    ./configure
    make
...and then ran into problems here:
    bitcoind &amp;
    ./lightningd/lightningd &amp;
    ./cli/lightning-cli help
When I typed 'bitcoind &amp;' it said no such command?
@_date: 2019-03-05 12:03:10
True. But we're going for brand recognition to not only indicate but promote. We want that '$'-type stamp that *means* Bitcoin... 
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:21:31
No. Lending isn't the problem... loans have worked for thousands of years... it's the money itself that is the problem. Fiat money that can be inflated any time its controllers wish is the problem. Bitcoin is better money. If all banks used Bitcoin, and lent Bitcoin, lending would not be something that would be a problem. Greed is the whole reason why we have Bitcoin, (or anything else worth having for that matter) greed isn't the problem. Shitty money is.
It would be like having sickle cell disease, and then claiming that the you're sick because you're hungry all the time.
@_date: 2019-03-01 11:43:39
Did that, but can't find the corresponding hash on the website... and wound up down a rabbit hole installing GnuPG and kpgp front end... and then nothing worked.
Edit: figured it out! See above.
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:54:00
@_date: 2019-11-08 00:16:18
!lntip 1000

Any feels good. More always feels better.
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:15:16
Life's going to kick your ass, kid.
@_date: 2019-11-17 14:21:32
It's actually a great idea.
@_date: 2019-11-07 08:20:29
They say it's okay in this sub... (I think)
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:19:17
I don't think he means 'regrets' like that... I think he means that at the time he made the best decision he could, and knows that he couldn't have predicted that Bitcoin would blow up like this.
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:46:16
And it’s everywhere the last couple days. Just nauseating.
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:13:43
Or... the bank keeping additional funds in the bank on top of what is needed for loans.
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:31:42
Omg it was a joke, and it was funny, relax.
@_date: 2019-11-28 08:43:55


Of course. That's the standard practice.


No, if you ever want to spend *from* your balance, you'll need a wallet, as, as soon as you spend any portion of your balance, your paper wallet is no good, and you would need another one.
Also, how do you plan on generating the private key that you'll be backing up on the metal card? If it was generated on a 'hot' device, like a PC or a phone, you have to trust that there are no bugs, backdoors, exploits, or malware on that device.
The hardware wallet generates the seed offline, and *keeps* it offline. That's the key advantage to having a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-25 21:42:03


Yeah, that's a great sales pitch to the people as we try to take over the world economy.
"Hey you know those dollars that are easy to use, lose 2% a year, and can't be stolen from you if they're in a bank account?
"Well what would you say to a new currency that requires three or four leading zeros to use for daily purchases, can fluctuate as much as 15% in an hour, is an absolute pain-in-the-ASS to use safely, and someone might kill you if you have a lot of it."
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:40:09
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:40:09
@_date: 2019-11-17 07:22:39
Awesome... are you going to short it? You sound pretty confident!
Oh, you have no idea what it's going to do, you just know a lot of people want it to go up... I get it.
@_date: 2019-11-23 22:14:11
You are wrong sir. Let’s say you invest $5000 in my firm, and for a limited time I offer a free insurance that will completely restore your investment should you lose money. The potential return for this investment is anywhere between 5% and 500%. Would you say that that was risky investment because of the potential for wild swings? Of course not.
And even if every investment *does* have risk, risk has nothing to do with DCA.


Your assuming that the asset is increasing in value over time. If it isn’t, whoever has the least average overall exposure will do better.
@_date: 2019-03-29 07:50:14
Please stop saying 'banksters'... please.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:36:36
Ahh, missed that. Thanks
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:50:17
It should be embarrassing for you that you took the time to point out something like that to a random person on the internet... is something you just did.
@_date: 2019-11-15 03:43:33
Great comment. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-11-30 11:35:58
OP should sign a transaction with one of the address with 1000 Bitcoin... then we can entertain this conversation.
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:34:59
The confusion was that it sounded like he was saying *any* address with lots of Bitcoin in it... he was saying any *specific* address with x amount of Bitcoin in it. You were right in the way that you understood his claim. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:40:36
I was a proponent of bits too, but sats are going to win the standard war because of the Lightning network. 
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:40:22
How much is what?
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:19:06
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:10:17
Way to avoid the work of addressing my point. Just downvote and tip your tinfoil hat.
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:40:50
Well it's kind of an extension of your idea that we really don't need to delineate a difference at all because there will never be a time when a product or service could be confused for such drastically different prices...
Mine just adds formality for things like advertisements, and stuff like that.
@_date: 2019-03-12 07:59:32
This thread got *dark*.

This is great.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:56:44
It doesn't have to... pretend Bitcoin isn't Gold, isn't Silver... pretend it's Copper... Digital Copper. Do you see Copper being worth less in five years than it is now?
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:06:23
But their kids might.
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:08:14
The problem with mixers, is you must trust them to actually mix your coins, and then you must trust them to return your coins as promised. Oh, and also trust that they are not working with law enforcement. 
How is Wasabi not a finished product? Could you give an example of a small mistake a new user might make?
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:14:19
Do you know of an article that has collected these examples? I’m working on a paper that would benefit from being able to cite all of them.
@_date: 2019-03-14 23:09:09
Yes! Thank you, much better.
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:27:17
Yeah, the same could happen to gold. Oh no? Ohhh, that's right gold is special.
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:18:15
Oh, interesting. So not the best place to trade? Why is the spread so big?
@_date: 2019-11-13 14:34:26
Why no spike?
@_date: 2019-03-15 11:58:37
You might *be* gay.
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:06:37
How mature.
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:18:41


How could you possibly know that?
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:36:14
Have. Would have hit me harder.
@_date: 2019-11-08 05:14:15
Yeah, why spend your money if you know that holding it will allow you to buy more stuff later?
That would be like someone knowing that they can buy a better computer in six months with the same $1000 they have right now, so no one would ever buy a computer now...
Oh wait.
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:09:22
You're a piece of shit.
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:40:24
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:37:56
The ‘you can hold it in your hands’ argument sucks. There are countless things that you can hold in your hands that add up to jack shit, and there are countless abstracts that dictate your life every day.
@_date: 2019-03-15 11:57:37
Fair enough. Will this still be a concern at 5% adoption? 20%? 80%?
@_date: 2019-03-22 05:17:35
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:33:09
The confusion when talking about gold is, gold serves two purposes in the market; it is a metal with utility value, and it is a speculative asset.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:21:01
Meaning... what?
@_date: 2019-11-16 12:32:53
You're talking about entropy/evolution where incentive and self-interest should be your focus.
It simple dude... who pays to clothe, house, and feed these college kids who are 'going to go back to thinking about whatever' in your Buckminster Fuller quote? Who pays for that, and why would they?
@_date: 2019-11-03 23:18:45
What's the damage? Please tell me it starts with a zero...
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:30:11
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:40:44
How do you change the private key?
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:10:12
Yeah, keep making negative statements with no support in a pro-Bitcoin sub. Do you just need attention?
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:30:00
Yeah, for better or worse, Lightning killed Bits. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 14:11:43
Damn, I had no idea. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-11-03 07:30:52
I asked a specific question. Now I don’t give a shit what you say.
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:16:03
Thanks for remaining civil throughout this exchange. I think I am very irritated with your argument, but I should be able to keep that irritation to myself.
Out of curiosity, what do you like about Bitcoin??
@_date: 2019-03-04 07:25:44
I know that’s possible, but I’m not super-proficient in Linux, so I figured I’d do it the straightforward way. 
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:32:14


Is this a joke? Or do you honestly believe that everyone who is in favor of smaller government is a racist bigoted piece of shit?
I'm actually asking.
@_date: 2019-11-08 01:59:03
You know what, that would be just fine so long as the lending is never fractional.
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:13:16
They've pretty much done everything they can do... even capitalizing on the exploit themselves to notify users of the scam. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:35:17
Or calling a currency a pound when a pound is also a unit of weight. Oh wait. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:39:52
Ahh thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:33:17
What are the others?
@_date: 2019-03-07 02:39:41
Use a separate linux laptop for everything Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:26:16
Yeah, what I just said. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:01:28
You realize Bitcoin can be broken down into pieces as small as we want, right?
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:22:06
Oh it is. It is. 
But a cult that worships world-changing technology can be a cult, and also be right.
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:47:45
Oh, I think it was like $20.
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:18:25

Hindsight is 20k.
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:50:30
Thank you, Doctor. It was figurative.
@_date: 2019-03-23 11:42:06
I 100% agree with what you're saying. But people have had another way that they can guard against inflation, they can buy gold. But they don't. For many reasons. But my point is, for Bitcoin to succeed it's going to take one of three things (or all). People becoming educated... as in hooked on the beauty of what Bitcoin is... The obsessed (us) making the user experience of Bitcoin better than using cash and credit cards... Or there being things that everybody wants, that you can only buy with Bitcoin.
Otherwise we are destined to remain a niche interest.
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:24:17
He's not, actually.
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:41:45
Neither are risky. Therefore mixing them is also not risky.


This is a *myth*. DCA decreases the *swings*, in **both** directions.
Now, DCA is a good way to acquire more of whatever the asset is, in the same way that saving money is a good way of getting more money. There is no advantage though.
As for 'buying the dip'... you cannot know that you have bought at a point that is 'low'. A given price doesn't mean anything. It can always go lower. All technical analysis can offer is where the speedbumps are in a given direction... but not where the price will go next.
@_date: 2019-03-05 12:18:45
ahh, no problem. I'll figure it out! Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:54:29
lol guilty.
@_date: 2019-11-01 21:07:34
I love that questioning your bullshit means I must be a fan.
Eat shit.

You think Milo Yiannopoulos is... *stupid*? That's what you're going with?
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:37:23
The mob has spoken dude... we're done.
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:54:44
HOW THE HELL DOES THIS BECOME A WORLD CURRENCY??
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:28:47
Trailing is far better than leading...
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:06:39
Hey... *why are you here?*
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:16:00
Not quite. I still need to trust that what I have in my safe will be exchangeable for that gold 10 years from now. Bitcoin doesn't have that problem.
Edit: nevermind, I misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying a gold-backed currency would kill Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:01:44
@_date: 2019-03-08 05:07:32
Also, how did you format the 'c-lightning' and the 'apt-get' to look that way in your response? ;)
@_date: 2019-03-12 05:53:47
FEEDING INFORMATION
BITCOIN PAYOUTS
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:26:13
Maybe it is. Please define 'scam', and we'll see if you're justified in calling Bitcoin one.
Also, what the fuck are you doing in r/bitcoin??
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:21:26
True. I've actually entertained the thought of selling in order to buy more, and then realized I was retarded.
@_date: 2019-11-06 05:22:31


I enjoyed reading what you wrote after imagining it with a Russian accent.
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:41:02

Honestly, I think writing like:

You've inserted this paradigm... I never agreed with you here. My example was bread in exchange for a chicken. That is not competition, that is cooperation.


I won't trouble you with asking for evidence of this.


I can't wait for us to both die so we can float up in the clouds and live under the Goddess's shining light of eternal paradise. I'm sorry, but you haven't demonstrated how any of this would work, or even that it could work. As soon as you divorce yourself from the idea that trading resources with one another is somehow bad, you will then see that money is nothing more than a way of storing value so that if I can't use the bread your offering me for the chicken I'm going to give you today, that I have some way of coming back a week (or a year) from now and collecting it then.


Amazing. Please be patient with us.

It’s a nice idea, but it’s absolute bullshit. Every organism on the planet for millions of years has had to hunt, trap, grow, or find food. All of that energy spent is called work. Some work is more efficient, and some do it better than others. Over time, the ones that do, eat better, feed their kids better, and pass on their genes.
Nothing’s changed. There’s nothing wrong with me asking you for a few loaves of bread in exchange for one of my chickens. It’s just trade. That’s all it is. And that’s all money is.

This is going to be hard to hear. But I honestly think that your time, money, and energy is better spent anywhere else than trying to get this $7,000 back. It's not *enough* money.
I would honestly recommend that you 'give' this money to this person who took it, and let it go. It sounds insane, but I've been in similar situations, and felt better as soon as I did exactly that.
Focus on new horizons, and let the lesson be what it is.
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:01:29
If what you describe is a problem, and I’m not saying it is... then people’s fear of missing out on the next bull-run up is a bi-product of Bitcoin’s deflationary nature, not a problem with how people are ‘thinking’.

I imagine that it is possible, but I have no experience with ChromeOS, sorry. If involvement is your goal, I will tell you I just got through setting up my full node with investment of new hardware that cost less than $200. I bought a used laptop from Ebay, and a used 500GB SSD from Amazon.
Installed Ubuntu on the laptop, then installed Bitcoind.

You assume the people of this sub are interested in making more fiat. Many of them are, but many of them aren't interested in trading as they know that most (if not all) can't.

From a security standpoint, he’s not talking about someone guessing the private key. He’s talking about securing your word seed. That’s what he means by definitely not 100% secure.

"Send me two-point-one million Bitcoin" works so well... when, WHEN are you ever moving whole bitcoins around to where your talking out loud about it?
There's *still* people that think that in order to buy, you have to buy a whole coin.
I wish the original standard had just referred to 100,000,000 Bitcoin as 100,000,000 Bitcoin. But like I said, I think it's too late now.

I waited *years* before buying a hardware wallet. Was certain that I was going to get a Coldcard. Finally was swayed by a number of factors to buy a Trezor Model T.
Looking back? I love my Model T, but I don't know that it was worth the extra money over the regular Trezor One.
Am I certain that I made the right decision buying a Trezor though? Absolutely, 100%.
Just like anything else, the more eyes and attention a project has, the more likely it is that bugs, and other problems will be caught quickly and solved before it results in millions of dollars lost due to some firmware error that I wouldn't even understand.
I love Coldcard, I love that it's not made in China, I love the man behind the project, but I feel much more comfortable with my Bitcoin stored on a mainstream, open-source (Ledger is closed-source) hardware wallet that has been around since the first hardware wallet, (because they made it!).
Anyway, if you go the Trezor route, they are 30% off right now.

You’re missing it. You cannot expect people to do the “right” thing and then scold and shame them when they don’t. You can take the ‘it’s not enough’ argument as far as you want. How much *should* the minimum wage be? $15? $25? How about $50? No really, why not pass a minimum wage law of $50 and then *no one* who was working for minimum wage would have any money problems at all.
Now think about why that isn’t true, and you’ll be on your way to understanding the big picture.

“People will just sit on it”. No man, that’s not how it works. Even in this hypothetical sit-on-it reality, short-term needs will require that some people part with some Bitcoin sometimes. And that’s your market. Bitcoin doesn’t have a liquidity problem *ever*. These aren’t gold coins. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:02:47


Inflation *artificially* creates jobs and makes the economy go, by way of stealing 3% of your buying power each year. Your incentive to 'invest' it, is brought on in part by the fact that your money is rotting in your hand.

It actually doesn't matter what you do... your expected value doesn't change. However, if you believe that Bitcoin is undervalued at this time, then putting all 12k in right now is perfectly justifiable. I would recommend having 2 to 10 times as much in cash (depending on your comfort with risk) if you should need it.
@_date: 2019-10-07 22:19:27
I never mentioned lightning.
You chose to have Bcash over Bitcoin as your default payment method. And then tried to present yourself as trying to provide the best user experience. I don’t believe that. No one else believes that.
I tell you as much, and you reply that I should keep in mind that ‘I may not have the full picture’.
Good luck.

HA! ;)
What about BB and AB?
Edit: the fuck? Downvoted for what??
@_date: 2019-10-13 06:17:27


Exactly... Bitcoin is an escape from the State, or it isn't.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:12:42
Poor bcasher.
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:13:09


Wait, what?
@_date: 2019-08-25 06:21:07
Well done man, entertaining read.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:53:03
No, it doesn't.
@_date: 2019-10-06 10:34:32
love it
@_date: 2018-10-26 00:31:17
Hey it's me, ur dad.

@_date: 2019-08-14 09:23:29
Will do. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-10-26 10:40:47
Who is that?
@_date: 2019-10-05 06:37:40
No... that's the problem. Venmo *can* be taken back. Bitcoin cannot.
@_date: 2019-10-31 04:16:27
And teachers deserve to be paid more... but they're not.
Just like how no one cares how a microwave works or the brilliance behind its engineering... most people also don't care about the history of Bitcoin. They want their microwave to work, and they want their 0.09 Bitcoin to go up.
@_date: 2019-10-08 04:27:40
The comment you linked to, wasn’t me.
@_date: 2019-10-09 10:13:29
Stop dude... for years I've tried explaining why DCA is a myth, but it's the pet betting strategy for half of this sub. They're not giving it up.
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:18:57
Like any of you know any of of this.
@_date: 2019-10-20 13:19:23
@_date: 2019-08-25 06:21:34


I want that on a t-shirt.
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:02:39
Yeah. Steven Crowder has a shirt that's a parody in the same vein. You don't have to like it, and it can be tongue-in-cheek.
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:40:22
No thanks
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:55:37


You can think of everything like this. Your family, your friends...your house and home.. none of it is really yours... it is there to experience.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:29:34
Ha! Love it.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:11:53


Honestly, how likely do you think this is?
@_date: 2019-08-18 11:41:15
Exactly. On a long enough timeline, all of the other currencies whether crypto, fiat, private, or public... they will all be absorbed by Bitcoin.
Or, we're totally wrong and the future is filled with thousands of currencies tailored to whatever the application it needs to be tailored to.
@_date: 2019-08-17 10:30:46
If we're the business, he's the customer... you can be frustrated without showing it.
@_date: 2019-10-21 15:08:07
Everything about this is what the fuck.
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:11:34
We’ll see.
@_date: 2019-08-17 13:16:04


What the hell is an evil force?
If your going to say something, say it.
@_date: 2019-10-02 06:30:36
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:56:46
I like that analogy at the end there.
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:50:18
I think it aged *very* well.
@_date: 2019-10-03 13:07:23
What the hell is XBT?
@_date: 2019-10-22 06:14:29
Well, for one, you have decentralization in quotes as though you are implying that it isn't.
Two, you have linked to individual images, instead of an album or a single connected image.
And finally, the parable makes no sense. I don't think that any good argument is being made, and if one *is* being made, I don't think it is being made in an understandable way.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:05:09
@_date: 2019-10-24 02:18:17
Please explain *any* of this.
@_date: 2019-10-13 06:13:45
Bitcurious... love it
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:28:54
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:31:38
You can worry about that, but it also means worrying about every other form of cryptography that we use today. That includes all your banking software, all of your end encryption on the Internet. So we will have lots of problems if quantum computing hurts Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:06:58
This is bad advice. It actually doesn't matter one bit if the security in question moves randomly. And DCA can only hurt you if the security is a long-term winner. Think about it.
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:51:44
Absolutely terrible analogy. *We* are the community of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:11:29
@_date: 2019-10-03 04:39:57
Too good.
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:31:25
Umm... which do you think is?
@_date: 2019-10-04 04:46:52
Yeah, there’s no traffic jams on a road that no one uses.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:28:19
Umm... are you sure about that?
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:36:58
Which cash?
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:24:55


And you chose not to *offer* BCH as a payment method, but set it as the *default* payment option?
Yeah, okay.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:06:33
But, that hasn't happened the last 2 times...
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:20:28
; )
@_date: 2019-08-22 05:52:29


Fair enough! I have sketched a number of things, and haven't been happy with any of them
@_date: 2019-10-06 22:26:22
It's not over 'til it's over.
@_date: 2019-08-15 10:40:52
Very helpful, thank you.
@_date: 2019-08-18 07:59:53
It's funny, because even back when there was a thread of a 'flippening', had *we* lost... I would just be thinking "Well, I hope hardware prices come down in price real fast, because this blockchain is about to get *biiiiiig*".
I would not be sitting over here going; 'Bitcoin Core is the real Bitcoin!' I would recognize the facts; the longest chain, with the most hashpower is Bitcoin. The end.
(and I would have sold *this* fork... just like I sold all my Bcash)
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:08:03
You know we’re in a currency war, right?
I won’t be back to your site.
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:16:06
Decentralization in Bitcoin doesn't refer the the coins being decentralized... it refers to the network managing it.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:32:45
That is one of the best jokes ever made about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:20:20
Ahhh, cool. Been in the space for years, never heard of that.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:38:56


I like that.
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:34:11
thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:15:05
Try again. I’ve never sold.
@_date: 2019-08-16 05:56:38


It makes me wonder how you think grammar like this will lend itself to your credibility.
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:04:30
Here's a buy for ya.
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:06:23


: )
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:38:34
That’s not why they’re skeptical.
@_date: 2019-10-04 05:11:58
Why is BCH the default currency??
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:51:23
Hey tell this guy to go fuck himself.
@_date: 2019-10-31 04:18:46


I caught that...
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:20:11
‘Bpay’ is better.
@_date: 2019-08-24 10:54:53
It was a library.
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:22:01
Well, you do if you want the payment to integrate seamlessly with your website and other payment options. And you most certainly do if you want to be able to accept Lightning payments.
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:16:08
One of the reasons why Bitcoin is so powerful is because the payment ‘settles’ so *fast*. In about 10 min, you have money that can’t be taken from you *ever*. 
I’d be happy to work something out, the problem you’re facing is that you need your Bitcoin so quickly. Have you looked into  ?
@_date: 2019-10-03 08:00:28
@_date: 2019-10-18 21:22:45
This is way too accurate.
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:06:41
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:36:46
Don’t look now, but $3 fees aren’t irrelevant to Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:32:40
I just realized that I was asking someone else to explain.
@_date: 2019-10-06 06:43:15
Ahh, that may be. I was the first to comment, so I didn't have any context.
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:35:11
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:39:56
Exactly, I'm as pro-Bitcoin as they come... but Banks built empires.
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:00:22
Sorry, expired, I was at work. Try again?
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:32:33
No save way to move the coins? Why?
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:23:24
I don't think you said enough
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:17:26
Fuck them. Tell everyone you know about that horseshit. That's the only way it will stop.
@_date: 2019-10-03 08:14:54
Thank you, sir!
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:50:14


*This* isn't the basics of trading. That was what I asked you about.
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:37:51
@_date: 2019-10-02 15:54:15
Love it
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:34:19
You've missed my point. We're *all* selling this to everyone who isn't holding. We're even selling this to people who *are* holding, because they could always be holding more.
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:22:52
Jesus christ, it was a joke.
@_date: 2019-10-01 13:43:05
That's pretty good.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:32:31
Umm... total? Or percentage?
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:24:08
A good thing for who? Certainly not the person who earned it.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:54:37
Except... if I'm being honest... it looks exactly like the bullshit Bitcoin logo at bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2019-10-01 12:44:41
I think the best long-term event would be his wallet to be discovered and spent. This way, we don't live in fear of this happening forever and ever.

@_date: 2019-10-08 06:09:51
Fuck Trevor.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:07:08
You started with a 'Bitcoin isn't viable as a currency because it's deflationary', and then switched to an anti-capitalism argument. I disagree with both.
Even with precious metals, anyone, no matter how little money they have, can buy *some*. Bitcoin's the same way.
As for your 'top 1% arguement'... umm so what? Bitcoin doesn't combat the ultra-rich or capitalism for that matter. What it does is provide sound money to anyone who wants some. *That's all*.
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:30:53
When I buy a hardware wallet, it will be this one.
Have you used it?
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:27:03
He’s always been my favorite candidate. Him and Hal Finney.
@_date: 2019-10-06 06:42:07


@_date: 2019-02-01 13:56:32
Autodiversification lol
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:47:54
Volatility is one of the major reasons why many stay away from Bitcoin. If Facebook coin can allow people to use something that has some of the benefits of Bitcoin with one of the drawbacks removed, the masses may be more comfortable using it.
@_date: 2019-10-20 13:22:16


Oh it will take much longer than that. It's not just the download speed that comes into play. *Every* block needs to be verified. That takes time.
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:27:40
Why the fuck are you here?
@_date: 2019-02-22 06:23:08














This? This indicated to you that I have a shitty attitude?

@_date: 2019-10-02 12:28:21

@_date: 2019-02-01 04:13:08
I *was* at 90% back in December 2017. Now it's closer to 60%.
@_date: 2019-02-18 09:16:49
As they should be. Technology has completely overhauled like 30 different industries in the past 30 years. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:25:40
Or maybe he's just an inflexible planner.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:17:08


@_date: 2019-10-20 10:41:20
I think this is a case of not being able to imagine future implementations of current technology. This has happened over and over throughout history. I think we'll be just fine.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:21:24




@_date: 2019-10-04 08:12:11

Wow, you must really like that guy!
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:26:50
I don't think that's how it's meant. I think the point is more about displacing not the 'stuff' but the fundamental power structures that have been in place for ages. Power structures that might actually be rendered obsolete because of technology.

@_date: 2019-10-18 12:15:44
And r/bitcoinbeginners is??

Wow... touche about being a terrorist over a typo.
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:24:40
Good point.
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:16:48
We'll see. You're more than welcome to short it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:36:07
We *better*. 'Cause I don't know what to say about Bitcoin if it runs up to $19,800 and then backs off. The price has never done that... and I don't know what it will mean if it does.
@_date: 2019-02-17 21:03:25
Everything is relative.
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:57:06
You might be a terrorist and ^^fuck ^^you realize it.
Edited. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:04:21


Someone please tell me where this idea comes from? It what universe would it ever be a good thing for my purchasing power to erode over time. The primary purchase of money is a store of value. The better the money does that job, the better the money.


Oh, so too much of a good thing?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:23:32
10,500... where? I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:04:47
Umm,  he spelled it the same way... I think his quotes around the word was pointing out what he felt was irony.
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:16:04
What are you talking about?? Who are you talking to? Nobody was using a webwallet in the first place, and duckduckduckgo isn't a webwallet, it's a search engine.
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:44:15
This. This a thousand times.
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:39:14
Not all who launder are washed.
@_date: 2019-02-01 05:58:32
Try again. Don’t assume that you know who you’re talking to. I wasn’t saying that I thought that the world would end, but  I believed *others* would, so I wanted to get out of the way. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:37:31
Yeah, that was a bit much. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:07:37
Wait 5 years and zoom out. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 18:57:44
That made me laugh.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:10:52
This is the most depressing thing I have ever read in this sub.
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:44:00
I've had this saved as pinned tab since you posted it, finally watching today. Paused halfway through to tell you that it is great!
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:53:11
Yeah, just reinstalled os just now, about to try that.

@_date: 2019-02-28 04:00:49
holy shit
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:01:13


My friend at work said this exact shit to me.
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:21:44
There's the door. This was cute.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:16:47
Despite how it may appear, Bitcoin is not anti capitalist, it’s only anti bad money.
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:12:31
Honest question: is the idealized version of Lightning Network the one where everyone runs a full node at their house?
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:05:32
1. I'm glad it was only $50... and losing *this* $50 may actually wind up saving you thousands down the road because of the caution will forever take.
2. Didn't know about duckduckgo's QR Code generator! I love it, thanks!
3. 3 is hard. Thanks for doing 3.
@_date: 2019-02-06 23:02:46
\&gt; just like there are people who lose their phone. 
No, he's saying, the price of Bitcoin fell 70% in 2018, and if it falls another 70% in 2019 then the Bitcoin kept on a phone will be not very much money, *and* Bitcoin kept on a hardware wallet will also be not very much money. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:54:07
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:43:53
I like it.
@_date: 2019-02-17 08:36:51
Everything's relative to everything else. You could ask how much gold does 1 BTC buy compared to $1000 USD. Track both of those over 10 years and you'll have a very good idea of how gold is performing against the dollar.
If all of a sudden, 1 BTC and $1000 USD can only purchase half as much gold as they could the year before, that means that the price of gold has doubled.
Now if instead we looked at 1 oz gold and saw that it and $1000 USD could only purchase half as much BTC as they could the year before, then we know that *BTC*'s value has doubled.
@_date: 2019-02-21 08:02:42
That makes sense then.
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:56:41
Well that's not what you said before, you said


Which makes it sound like trading or acquiring Bitcoin on coinbase is stupid.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:27:16
I wasn’t the on making the positive claim for DCA... do you know how this works?


It does make sense. Just because we can’t know the result of something doesn’t mean than any advice is as good as any other advice.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:46:00
January 3, 2009
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:12:59
Please make that! I want to share it!
@_date: 2019-02-02 08:46:27
Do you honestly believe anything you just said?
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:40:13
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:39:55
This is fucking gold.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:30:45
Exactly, for close to 5 years I've been arguing that we need to drop the decimal entirely and simply use Satoshi. Or, hell call them 'bits' call them 'dots'... call them anything you want, but get rid of anything that requires *thinking* about any of it.
@_date: 2019-10-10 11:57:30
Why does he say 'sucks' at the end?
@_date: 2019-02-17 21:06:18


So, so true. The *reason* is that at one time, Bitcoin's survival was actually in question. Now we all feel entitled to a great price, because we're *used* to Bitcoin being here to stay.
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:06:39
Wow... almost exactly 61.8
@_date: 2019-02-22 06:21:45
Oh my god, do you have no sense of humor at all?
"This bank sucks! They told me I couldn't have an account and should never ask for one again. Fuck them"
"Maybe you're a terrorist and don't know it."
It what world would that be me calling you a terrorist? In what world could you *be* a terrorist and not know it??
It was clearly a joke. And you're clearly a dick.
@_date: 2019-02-21 08:48:55
Well, I wasn’t saying they were bastards. 
@_date: 2019-06-13 13:13:53
Yeah, like Electrum.
E: lol downvoted for what?
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:52:08
No one did that.

Inflation sinks all ships.
@_date: 2019-02-28 07:36:21
Ahh! Sorry I missed that 
@_date: 2019-02-06 23:09:10
Same thing I thought, but remember that this community has members that may have only joined in the last few weeks, or months. So what is obvious to you may still be a really cool concept to someone else.
Let's try not to be dicks to the very people we're encouraging adoption from.
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:58:02
What do you recommend for normies? Hell, what do you recommend for veterans?
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:43:59
yeah, good point
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:15:32
Fortune favors the hold
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:17:59
They're making a joke that if you bought Bitcoin below 10k, then you are the smartest.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:47:11
I think I might have been using the wrong words anyway. I think it’s puts and calls as far as options. I think I may have been mixing instruments and securities. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 08:31:01
*wanna buy a dollar?*
@_date: 2019-02-21 08:49:18
Well thank you!
@_date: 2019-02-28 06:07:10
The same way it held from $1100 to $239.
The same way it held from $213 to $70.
The same way it held from $29 to $3.
@_date: 2019-02-15 04:49:13
Yeah, I knew that. I was making a joke.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:15:28


Or play poker in an online casino...
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:24:49
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:38:33
Wow. Ok. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:23:52
Doesn't sound like him
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:12:01
Once again I'll ask you, like the others; What the fuck are you doing here?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:13:13
Exactly. Even today's price of Bitcoin when compared to 2013's price has been affected by inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:36:01
Thank you!
Edit: Wait, you'd be just as likely to catch a peak...
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:00:16


This sounds like bullshit, but I'm listening if you care to explain.
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:50:32
Wait, how do you know they are the same person?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:37:42


@_date: 2017-11-21 07:17:32
Do I have Bitcoin Gold the same way that I was able to cash out Bitcoin Cash? If so, could you direct me to the how?
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:30:06
This is fantastic.
@_date: 2019-02-28 22:14:58
...okay, why is that? Not safe?
@_date: 2019-02-21 22:52:04
I was saying that it's amazing that banking has survived as long as it has in its current state.
@_date: 2019-02-15 10:00:50
*c'mon kid, first one's free*
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:38:35
SHIT!!! Yes I did.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:09:42
Holy SHIT!
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:58:18
I guess I'm a sucker. I would up looking up the video that he was talking about.
@_date: 2019-02-22 05:01:16
What the fuck are you talking about? Is English your native language?? I made a joke about you being a terrorist... and you called me retarded. We banter back and forth, and then like a coward, you delete all the evidence of your shittery.
Whatever dude.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:51:52
He wasn’t comparing the currencies! He was saying that neither are backed by anything. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 08:01:47
So much this. People literally mock my argument that the Bitcoin I tried to *give* them 3 months ago would be worth almost 3 times as much now.
Them: Can I spend it at the grocery store?
Me: Can you spend a gold coin there?
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:13:20
Okay, that's an interesting idea
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:51:38
This is a really good point. To add to what you're saying, I think one of the major differences between then, and now, is the 4 additional years that bitcoin has been traded, tested, talked about, spread, held, and sold. In 2013, I was telling my friends... now I'm *selling* to my friends.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:03:09
I don’t think you’re trying to scam anyone. The problem is Venmo is not irrevocable like Bitcoin *is*.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:25:03
This. Exactly this. I realized when we dropped below 10k for the first time that we will never be happy for more than an hour.
@_date: 2019-06-08 12:12:57
But what about cost? At one time, saying ‘Oh, that $0.22? That’s a miner’s fee. It goes to the people that run the computers that keep the network secure.’ Was an amount that pretty much no one had a problem with. $3.50 is an amount often close to the price of whatever you might want to buy. 
This is why I think the future may be lightning, and *only* lightning. Opening a channel is something you might do for a child of yours when they turn 12. And they might go the rest of their life without ever opening one again.
The bottom line is, Bitcoin is the best settlement  layer the world has ever seen. But it’s shit as a currency. Lighting is just about perfect as a currency because it’s built on bitcoin itself but with none of the drawbacks.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:51:29
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:36:31
Yeah, no. I meant comes back to 8k or something like that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:07:53
...or it's real right now because it's Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:03:28
Forbes? Excellent!
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:32:37
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:07:45
@_date: 2019-02-17 08:15:21
Holy shit that's exciting. What time frame do you imagine for this?
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:08:46
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:54:40
So there will be longer and longer periods of sideways movement? That's actually pretty good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:25:10
I think the gold and the Federal Reserve should be switched.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:14:16
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:30:06
It was $10,000. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 18:50:49
I'm 42. I hope that is in my lifetime.
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:07:45
Also, I tried to go to the website that you listed, but my Ublock origin prevented me from visiting. This might be a good time to invest in a free adblocker too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:36:19
That's true. But Bitcoin is not a roulette wheel... I don't think anyone really knows what it is... yet... but it's not a roulette wheel.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:05:25
That was good. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:49:29
\&gt;The reward will drop to just 3.125 in about 5 years. So fees will need to be the larger share of the block reward by then.
Depending on the price of Bitcoin of course.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:17:30
The difference is, just like all the people who have made fun of your position, they *want* Bitcoin to fail.

umm.. I don't think so... 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:58:54
I'm 40. People debated in the early nineties if they would ever own a computer... like it was an option not to. At this rate, we can't even imagine how much easier *all* of this will be in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-02-15 00:13:54
@_date: 2019-02-20 05:28:48
Hmm, a full node on my phone... interesting. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:34:10
Wow, downvoted to hell for recounting an anecdote, and then making a glib, hyperbolic comment about an institution that keeps my money but can’t give it to me if I need it quickly.
And in a subreddit for a technology that we believe could replace banks altogether.
Whatever kids. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:45:23
Any tips/advice? I'm interested.
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:11:16
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:08:37
When did remind me stop working here?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:21:06
Well, yeah... if you were the only person I could buy from, and your offer was temporary.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:23:22
If everything stayed the same over the next year, sure. But what I've said for the last 3 months is; if Wall Street gets involved, if those flood gates open, then it will make 2017 look like just the beginning.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:35:51
I feel like your answer is a good one, I thank you, but It’s still eluding me. Especially the aspect of Bitcoin price being stabilized by a future’s market. It could be my lack of understanding of the market in general. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:13:20
I remember reading during late 2017 that a surprising number of holders said that they would consider selling around 200k-250k... so... I guess we'll have some major resistance at that level :)
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:06:26
Yeah. Well I *was* going to share this.
@_date: 2019-02-17 08:23:27
If it were $3000 per U.S. Citizen no, *world* citizen, yes it is a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:07:03
Makin' you think you're crazy is a billion dollar industry.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:10
Bought big at $9970... fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:30:13
I hope so. I feel like the long-term success depends on it. 
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:17:48
A provably-fair, lightning poker site.
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:23:53
Normally, I'd be on board with you for the nuanced position, but it doesn't work in this example. It's logically inconsistent to say that an open ledger using blockchain is a fraud, but a closed ledger using blockchain isn't. As much as I don't want to admit it, all of this hilarity and criticism of Jamie Dimon is warranted.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:34:55
Nope. Think of forks like new metals being discovered. Not more gold.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:51:43
Not when your savings is an investment

Yeah, 'cause that's what I was saying.
fuck you
@_date: 2019-02-19 11:18:54


Hi, couple questions. Why are you here? What can replace Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:43:23
Hey I want in on this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:59:43
thank you
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:39:10
effort to loose?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:17:06
I'm so glad you got in brother! A week ago I bought 0.30 just to be able to sell to friends so they could get in on the excitement too... nobody bought any from me... so I'm still stuck with it.... o h   w e l l  
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:00:08
Ehhh, wait a day.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:46:28
The question mark was sincere confusion. I wasn't challenging you, I didn't understand why you brought it up.
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:23:51
Excellent! Yes I will share it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:50:15
Yeah that’s probably what it is. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:39:45
ahh! of course! Thank you for the in-depth answer!
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:50:49
Well, mine was on a paper wallet, which is sitting next to me, but I don't know how to access it. I'm on PC with an iPhone.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:54:35
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:16:24
Ahh, okay. thanks
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:40:38
It's crazy with as much coverage as Bitcoin has received, that this is still an issue, but yeah, I just had someone ask me this week if you could 'break one up'.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:13:41
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:08:13
Exactly, what's the difference between 'selling' and 'spending' anyway.
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:38:02
So... good?
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:47:06
If you had a 10 Troy Oz bar of gold and decided to cash it in, you would pay *more* in fees and costs than you would with an equal amount of Bitcoin (in value), even with Bitcoin’s crazy fees right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:05:58
Sold some BCH ;)
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:53:54
Umm... not with bitcoin... because it's *measured* in units, but *sold* as a fluid. In other words, you can't buy 1/347th of a share of Apple, can with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:49:53
Well that's the best endorsement I've seen this year.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:31:48


@_date: 2019-06-10 21:05:25
Hey! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:33:12
Agreed. But you're arguing the merits of Linux over iOS... to the consumer, one is a complicated shithole, and the other is simple, elegant, and easy to understand. This is why Apple was so successful. They focused on user experience over specs of hardware, or having the latest tech.
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:44:11
I'm not being sarcastic...
I'm running a full node, is that what you mean?
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:33:05
So what if he is?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:51:25
Nice! thanks again
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:32:40
Question: if my bitcoin is in cold storage, in order to get the altcoin value, I’d have to expose my private keys to the world, because they would be the exact same, right?
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:04:43
I submitted a support ticket on Oct 22... still no response. They're makin' Steam look good.
Edit: They replied today. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:43:15
I loved reading what you wrote. So much that I had to type this in addition to upvoting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:29:45
Nice! It wasn't rhetorical, I really wanted to know!
@_date: 2019-02-14 05:46:06


Yeah, 'cause I said any of that.
@_date: 2019-02-06 23:05:56
I've never sold.
That said, I honestly wish I hadn't bought all the way up the mountain.
I mean, I don't blame myself for buying. I honestly believed that it was the Bitcoin explosion of mass adoption that we had been waiting for for years... and why wouldn't it be? *Everyone* was talking about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:19:45
For the record, I evangelize to those that walk into the church.... not to random schmucks.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:21:49
there's gotta be some irony here if we keep looking
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:25:23
thank you
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:42:46
I’m now less depressed.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:16:17
Been meaning to watch this for over a week now, so glad I did. It's a great talk.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:12:49
Thank you. I couldn't figure out how if something that *was* threatening Bitcoin, is now *not* threatening Bitcoin, how it could be anything but good news. Now it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:18:51
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:44:59
Upvoting you. I don't see why he can't be wrong, unscrupulous, and also genuinely emotional about the horrible shit that goes on in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:16:16
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:30:24
Or hey, let’s say in the future, we find a strong direct correlation between likelihood of committing rape and ownership of rape-fantasy literature. Are we burning books yet?
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:35:15
Great answer, thanks.
@_date: 2019-02-28 22:27:22
Forgive me, but this seems overly complex. I don't want to run Bitcoin on a virtual machine, and I don't want to run it over tor. I'm just trying to figure out why my programs don't launch after installing them on the latest version of Ubuntu desktop.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:19:01
Been hodling for 5 years brother!
@_date: 2019-02-22 10:31:40


Hyperbole don't you think? What's the real-world probability of me losing my 1.0 Bitcoin if I were to use an online wallet like Blockchain.info for the rest of my life?
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:26:51


What is the difference?
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:51:17
Do you know how to save an image?
Do you know how to crop?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:38:55
Not even close... guess I'm a pessimist..
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:01:32


If that's yours, you should be proud of it.
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:25:43


Honest question: why is sending $7000 on LN not yet recommended, and when will it be okay?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:44:19
What makes Coinbase dishonest?
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:22:41
I'm not positive, but I'm thinking that he is saying that any currency that requires that you pay 2 or 3 dollars to *spend* 2 or 3 dollars, doesn't work as a currency, but may in fact work very well as a store of value like a gold bar.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:30:21
You might be right. I know that *personally*, I have no problem spending my bitcoin even now, but the idea of paying $3 to send $27 kills any desire. 
@_date: 2019-12-15 14:49:34


Does this safely/legally sidestep the KYC bullshit the rest of us are dealing with?
@_date: 2019-02-13 06:15:11
fuck off
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:01:32
This is the worst comment I've read in months.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:51:02
Guilty of bullet points   and  but I don't think I can be saved.
@_date: 2019-02-06 08:18:44
If the torch keeps moving, it’s going to be in the thousands soon. How many people can you trust with thousands of dollars for no reason? This is such a great idea. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:24:23
I firmly disagree.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:17:55
I'm a third the way through that video, and came back to thank you... I love everything he's saying.
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:18:13
I like your style. I have most of my money in Bitcoin, but I have kids, and rent, so Dollars it is.
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:53:27


You'll need to support that... with anything...
And please, for the love of progress, stop using the word 'banksters'. It was stupid the first time someone said it 15 years ago. The difference is, there are a whole lot of people watching this space now... and using the word makes us all look like idiots.
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:47:57
Thanks for the explanation. I think I *sorta* knew some of that. You explained it well.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:07:54
thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:14:21
OMG right??
I was in ecstasy at $6400, just having a new floor of $6k solidly established. I don't even know what to do with myself at $7200... 
I was secretly thinking 'no way we hit $7500 by the end of the year'.
What do I know.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:00:17
This site?  ??
That's not Bitcoin??
@_date: 2019-12-16 08:44:05
Take your Bitcoin, and shove it up your ass...
@_date: 2019-12-20 06:09:38
What would you measure it against then, gold?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:05:14
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:07:45
When a company splits it stock, it's for the express purpose of making those shares easier to acquire/or to lower the barrier of entry. Splitting Bitcoin's 'stock' into its organic 100,000,000 now, *before* we hit wall street, let's everyone become accustom to losing the decimal place and owning *lots* of Bitcoin gold dust. In currency, decimals are used to keep track of the afterthoughts... from a marketing/branding perspective, I think the time to change may have been years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:46:39
Exactly this. 
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:26:15
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:52:26
fuck, you.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:45:02
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:40:45
what. the. hell.
The original quote doesn't say anything about surgery. The word used is 'dissecting'.
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:28:42
Yeah with Lightning Network nodes, unlike mining, I feel like the "Building the Network to give Bitcoin Mass Adoption Value" is the perspective that should be taken and the investment sold as. Almost like late-stage (or early, depending on your perspective) infrastructure development made by those who will directly benefit from others' use of Bitcoin (meaning us, the holders).
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:17:55
Wow. In my view Bitcoin has already provided the value you speak of. The price is catching up to *it*. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:49:51


@_date: 2017-11-13 15:02:40
Bitcoin is very likely http.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:52:20
Okay, but how do you suppose we do that with fees as high as they are? I mean let’s assume *instantaneous* confirmations. How can Bitcoin serve as a currency when it costs you the price of a cup of coffee to pay for a cup of coffee?
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:19:43
Talk about missing the point.
@_date: 2019-12-23 15:20:16
How many **people** are affected by bullshit involving USD compared to BTC. That’s the important question to ask right now.
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:13:50
Okay, thanks will do.

If you think that Bitcoin is a PayPal replacement, then no wonder you see it as a bubble. *We have never seen anything like Bitcoin before*. That means that if Bitcoin has any value at all, it is very difficult to say what a fair price would be for a single unit of measure.
Let's look at what Bitcoin now, or may soon compete with/and or replace:
Transfer of money from one person to another like MoneyGram or Western Union. Why is Bitcoin better? Because it's faster, more convenient, and lower cost.
A store of value like gold or silver. For centuries people all over the world have moved their wealth into precious metals in order to find stability, safety, and protection from a myriad of terrible things that can happen with fiat currency. They are too many to list here. Why is Bitcoin better? Because I can buy as much Bitcoin as I want (I don't need to buy a whole bar, or a whole coin), I can store the Bitcoin privately and anonymously, and I can travel with it, *with no physical counterpart*, by just memorizing a series of words.
And last but not least, this is perhaps the only asset in the history of mankind, that if properly stored, cannot be stolen, seized, or confiscated by anyone. Yes, *can not*, as in, impossible.

Conceding the point. I was speaking only of the risks associated with the risks *to the security of the coins themselves*.

Gold has been used for thousands of years as a store of value. Why? Because it is rare, pretty, and indestructible. But there are rarer metals that are much more expensive to acquire... and yet the gold standard remains the gold standard... because gold has been used for thousands of years as a store of value. Get this; no other cryptocurrency will ever have a longer record than Bitcoin. Ever. Bitcoin has a *proven*, time tested, blockchain that one day people will refer to as going "all the way back to 2009".

Here's the idea. Let's say Bitcoin is trading for $30... then it shoots up to a never-before seen All Time High of $100. It falls a little bit... and flatlines at around $50 with no real movement to speak of. A year later it breaks through the $100 price to reach $500... and falls down to around $250... if it ever falls below $100, I would be able to say 'Bitcoin is dead, it just fell below the *previous* all time high.'
You can think of it like a trading range that is established when the price breaks new ground and establishes a new 'top'.
You're not wrong about 18k, being a 'previous' high, and it actually took me a second to try to figure out what I was trying to explain. I suppose the best way to make the distinction would be length of time. The time frame matters.

I get where you're going with this, but the Federal Reserve Bank doesn't operate as a Ponzi scheme. So that you know; a Ponzi scheme is a very specific scam wherein initial investors are paid with the money that comes in from later investors.

The point is not to find good places that you could put your money in order to avoid losing purchasing power over time, the point is to illustrate that the money is not a good store of value. That's all.

If you approach the problem from a reasonable standpoint, you would judge your money based on how well it performs as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Pretty much all money does the first and the last... but almost all of them are varying degrees of shit when it comes to a store of value. Ideally, money would serve as all three the best it could.
Rotting money is not ideal, why would slowly rotting money be better?

Imagine a town with only 10 people in it. You've got a baker that bakes bread, a farmer that grows wheat and has an apple orchard, a brewer, a store owner, and a banker who provides banking services, and prints the money for the town. Each of these men has one employee that works for him. Everyone buys apples and bread from the store, some people buy beer. Only the baker and the brewer buy wheat. Every employee is paid by their employer. Every employer earns profits with sales. That is... except for the banker. He doesn't earn money, he prints it. When he wants apples, bread, or beer, he prints new notes on his money printing machine, walks down the street and buys whatever he wants from the store. When he needs to pay his employee he prints the notes on his money printing machine. The good news is, he only prints around 2% per year.

The thing is, we don't need Bitcoin to replace fiat... all we need is a store of value that anyone can buy from anywhere, that's accepted by everyone, that can't be confiscated, controlled, or counterfeited.
Anything extra, is just a bonus.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:55:31
This concerns me, as it makes me think that the new people who are buying into Bitcoin, aren't doing it because it's useful, but because the price is going up.

Good try. I was telling people to get out of that thing when they were describing it to me before I ever heard the name Bitconnect.
It's real simple. When you make a claim, you should support it if someone asks you to. Not tell them to go do research in order to prove the point you're trying to make.

It's not true. By your reasoning, if I know that the dollar loses 3% per year, I would never keep cash because I know the value is always falling.
Look. I forget which redditor made the argument (if anyone knows, please tell me). Here's the simple counter to this "I'll just hoard my money if the currency is deflationary" argument:
&lt;Have you ever bought a computer? You have? Why would you when you could have just waited 6 months and gotten a better one for the same money??&gt;

    6 rolls to receive 64: 33.5%
    7 rolls to receive 128: 27.9%
    8 rolls to receive 256: 23.3%
    9 rolls to receive 512: 19.4.4%
    10 rolls to receive 1024: 16.2%
    11 rolls to receive 2048: 13.5%
    12 rolls to receive 4096: 11.2%
    13 rolls to receive 8192: 09.3%
So being willing to wait through 13 rolls will result in receiving *8192* marshmallows 9% of the time. I'm not a mathematician, so maybe someone else can chime in here, but I'm pretty sure that due to the exponential growth, and the expected value, it will never be a good move to stop playing the game, provided that you can play the game repeatedly. If you're given only one chance to play, I think the EV works the same way, and it is *still* in your best interest to play as long as possible, as you may wind up winning more marshmallows than there are grains of sand on all the beaches on the planet.
Someone please let me know if I'm wrong here.

It can be a scam, but not a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2019-04-22 06:42:49
Okay, fair enough. But I think the only way to answer the question is to have to 'pay' to play the game. That would allow us to create game theory around it.
So let's say it costs 5 marshmallows to play. Then you could determine what your best strategy is?
Again, not a mathematician.

Fees killed the currency aspect of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin was in the hundreds, everyone I knew that had any, spent some. But being charged as much or more in fees that you'd be charged for pulling out cash at an ATM, then what's the point.

I've never seen someone miss so many points so quickly. Let's address them.


Right now, in general this is true. The point I was making was not that if we used Bitcoin prices would go down, but that one of the factors that affect price is the cost of a transaction. If the merchant pays more, we will pay more.


I had no hate for Visa. I was responding to someone who was arguing for the merits of credit card transations, who didn't seem to understand that those merits come at a cost. A literal cost. It's not good, it's not bad. The network doesn't run for free, and the people running the network don't work for free. Someone's paying for those costs, and he seemed to think that the merchant paid those costs in a vacuum.




Irrelevant, and already addressed.

You couldn't be more wrong if you tried. Is gold valuable even though it isn't used as a currency? Of course it is. Gold has been used for centuries as a store of value. We now have digital gold that can be sent at the speed of light to anyone in the world for pennies. Even *if* Bitcoin never becomes a currency, it serving as a hedge against a falling dollar is all it would ever need to be.

Okay... *significantly* better money. The point is, a lot of people seem to think that Bitcoin is some sort of capitalism-killing, ‘bankster’-slaughtering cryptonite. It isn’t. They get to play too, but they’ll have to play by different rules now. Rules that don’t allow their political associations to protect them, or allow profits through loosening of lending laws.
It’s better money. My phrasing may make it sound like that’s a small thing. It is not. Considering it has never been improved since its inception, I’d say that’s a pretty big deal.

*Actually*, if you think about it, especially for larger purchases, if the merchant is saving 3% by accepting bitcoin, then they can afford to offer a '2% discount when you pay with Bitcoin'. You've seen something similar for cash payments at a gas station in lieu of using a credit card.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:14:10

And entertainment is enjoyment? Doing things that we like to do?
No, that's recreation. I'm talking about music, theater, art, performance art, social commentary... hell even pornography... 
All of these things require human effort, and that effort is best when it is incentivized and compensated.

Consider this. What if Bitcoin goes to $100,000 (or whatever), and stays there. Let's say the block reward is crap... like, really crap. Couldn't we have a *deescalation* in the arms race?? Why does the arms race have to only move one direction? Couldn't it become unprofitable to buy ASIC's, so people start using GPU's again? And then at some point, it just isn't worth the electrical costs to mine with a GPU at all, so all of a sudden people start securing the network with... any computer running bitcoind... mining becomes the same altruistic, green, feel-good thing that running a full node now is.

I'm okay with money losing value over time. That would be the scenario we would have with the Bitcoin halving rate looking like:
64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
Which is what I always thought was ideal.
What I'm not okay with is, money losing value over time *by the value being transferred to someone else*. That's the state of fiat at this time.

Yeah, I'm familiar with the concept. The vision I had for the future was one where we would visit the 'bank' (blockchain) maybe once a year for major purchases (car, house), but the rest of the time carry 'cash' directly backed by Bitcoin. This was the only solution I could imagine that would allow millions of people to use Bitcoin on a daily/hourly basis.

That is a link to a video that is an hour and a half long. Could you give me the time markers where you'd like me to watch?
I've never seen a ContraPoints video before, I will watch the first one.
Before you read my response to the video you linked, let us clarify exactly what we're talking about when we talk about the right to free speech: Only the government can violate the First Amendment. Meaning the First Amendment does not protect your place of business from being picketed because you sent a tweet denying the Holocaust. It doesn't protect you from your Twitter account being closed and all your tweets being deleted by Twitter, Inc.. Nor does it prevent your boss from firing you for saying there was no Holocaust. However it *does* protect you from being arrested and prosecuted for saying there was no Holocaust. But for the purpose of this discussion, I will try to view the issue through the lens of infringement of free speech being defined as 'being silenced (or feeling silenced) by someone or something'.
With regard to Hitchens' point about special care being given to radical speakers ( I agree with him, but not with the point that I think many would take away from what he is saying. The protection Hitchens is advocating for, is not protection by state. Hitchens is arguing for the individual to be careful when being so certain that there is no work left to do on a topic. To avoid dismissing points that you find, too extreme, offensive, or radical.
Here ( Contra makes the point that people being told they are Islamophobic, transphobic, sexist, or racist  is a "subtle indirect way of trying to get you to not say a certain thing."... umm... no. Personal attacks that relegate your entire position to being 'racist' are not subtle, or indirect, and amount to ad hominum attacks. I don't need to dispute your position on immigration, I'll just shame you for your privilege, or your racism, or anything else, as long as it isn't actually addressing your point. This would be the same as me calling Contra a 'gay leftist snowflake' when he argues for safe spaces, and measures against hate speech on campuses. I didn't address his point, I called him a name stopped the conversation. Both of these examples satisfy the definition I stated earlier for infringing, or shutting down free speech. 
There are a lot of problems here ( First, I would need to know specifically what he's referring to when he says 'small acts of racism, sexism, and homophobia'. I might wind up defending the examples he gives, or agreeing 100% that the snide comment from the MAGA-hat-wearing Trump-supporter was effectively suppressing speech. Contra gave specific examples when it came to the attacks toward the right, but he speaks in generalities when equating those attacks toward the left. As for 'marginalized people', I don't accept the idea that some people are marginalized. If you're talking about people who are not the same color as the majority, or feel the same way sexually as the majority, or practice a religion that is not the religion of the majority... okay. But what's the point? Being in a group that is not included in a larger group, does not a victim make.
( I've been atheist for about 20 years, but only felt comfortable 'coming out' to coworkers and acquaintances in the last 5. Why? Because the culture has changed. At the time my ideas would not have been received well, some people would have been scared of me, and I think it could have cost me my job.
I was not being 'silenced'. The market of ideas made my ideas difficult to present without fear of criticism, mockery, loss of friends, loss of family, or even violence. At no point in those 15 years was I being 'silenced'. I held a position that was rare, seen as a threat by most people, and flew in the face of convention and tradition. So what? If it's a good idea, it will survive. The market determines price. This applies to every idea. If you don't feel like being ridiculed by those that find your ideas ridiculous, that's your choice. Flat-earthers believe what they're saying too.
( Umm.. I *can* deal with it. Depending on who is calling me a racist, I may talk with them for hours to figure out why they see my argument that way, or I may walk away, and not speak to that person anymore. I don't know of anyone who can't deal with being called a racist. But again, I object to the way that Contra seems to assume that if someone is *called* a racist they they *are* a racist.
( "Some forms of speech tend to dampen other forms of speech." What? I have no idea what he's talking about here. You mean the way Windows™ dampens Linux?
( Uhggg, again with the 'marginalized groups'. If you go on YouTube and tell people that you're a 45-year-old man who has 8 wives, you can expect to be made fun of, mocked, and ridiculed by those that see your behavior as ridiculous. If you tell those same people that you think the moon landing was faked and the earth is flat, you're going to be mocked. And if you tell people that your going to give your transgender kid puberty blockers at the age of 10, you're going to be mocked, criticized, and ridiculed. Do you know who else was mocked, criticized, and ridiculed? Galileo. Of course, when they were done ridiculing him, they formally questioned him, threatened to torture him, forced him to recant his statements, and required him to live under house arrest for the rest of his life. But it was good idea. And now we all know that the earth does indeed orbit the sun.
Well... except for the flat-earthers.
( lol... I like this guy... subscribed.
( Completely disagree... well okay, not within the scope of this conversation... but once again, in a Constitutional sense, our citizen's freedom of speech is one of things that is so different about this country compared to almost every other.
( Hitchen's inconsistency is a great point. But, I'm reluctant to give full credit because I suspect the forum may have had something to do with the difference in his action. Had the 'fascist crackpot' started harassing him at the first venue, where he was the only one speaking at the time, I think he may have ignored him, but I don't think he would have asked for security. I'm thinking the second venue required him to consider other people on the stage and their time.
Overall, very entertaining video, very likable guy.
My final thoughts are; the left does not have a reputation for hating free speech due to safe-spaces and accusing people of transphobic language. The left has the reputation for hating free-speech because of the left's willingness to resort to violating *other people's rights* in order to hinder, or prevent someone who they oppose from speaking.
Warren Farrell protest at University of Toronto
About fifteen protesters stood in front of the doors before the event, forming a barricade and blocking attendees from entering through the main doors of the auditorium. About two dozen Toronto Police Service officers were present to provide security for the event, including officers on bicycles and on horseback. U of T Campus Police were also present.
One protestor was arrested after a scuffle broke out in front of the auditorium’s doors. He was later released with no charges. Another protestor was cautioned for assault of a police officer at the back entrance. A video posted on YouTube shows event attendees entering the building, and people identified by the videographer as organizers physically assaulting protestors.
Milo Yiannopoulos UC Davis Protest
Over 1,500 people gathered on the steps of Sproul Hall to protest the event. The protest had been a non-violent, student gathering until a group of 150 black bloc protesters slowly entered the crowd and interrupted the protest.[9][8] The interrupting protesters, which included Antifa activists and some who identified themselves as members of the left-wing group By Any Means Necessary,[10][11] set fires, damaged property, threw fireworks, attacked members of the crowd, and threw rocks at the police.[8] Within twenty minutes of the start of the violence, the Yiannopoulos event was officially canceled by the university police department due to security concerns, and protesters were ordered to disperse.[9][12] The protests continued for several hours afterwards, with some protesters moving into downtown Berkeley to break windows at several banks, a Starbucks, a Target, a Sprint store, and a T-Mobile store.[13][11] Among those assaulted were a Syrian Muslim, who was pepper sprayed and hit with a rod by a protester who said "You look like a Nazi",[14] and Kiara Robles, who was pepper sprayed while being interviewed by a TV reporter.[15] One person was arrested for failure to disperse, and there was an estimated $100,000 in damage.[16]
Ben Shapiro Protest at Cal State
"The day of the speech, hundreds of student protesters formed human chains, blocking the doors to the event, and staging sit-in protests. When Shapiro began his speech, a protester pulled the fire alarm. After the speech ended, Shapiro was escorted out by campus police."

Okay, well, what's happening there is the state has seized computers, and on those computers are unsecured Bitcoin, which the government then takes... the same way that a thief might steal your Bitcoin if they were to break into your house and access your unsecured computer. 
When I say confiscate, I mean in the sense of having my car or my person searched and having gold coins or bearer bonds taken because they are found and they want them. Bitcoin doesn't work like that, because they aren't physical, and can't *be* found. When properly secured they are *impossible* to take.

I have a friend who *continues* to talk about some guy that went to jail for having started "the first cyrptocurrency". I've told him over and over that Bitcoin is the first, he's probably thinking of e-gold, which is a *digital* currency.
I believe this post.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:08:34
This is a subreddit full of Dan's.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:56:46
I had no idea. I thought quantum-computing would unravel all encryption when it got here (if it's a real thing).
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:08:13
If that's true, then LN isn't nearly the second-layer solution I had hoped for.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:16:22
You’re right, we do. And they’re dogshit. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:58:45
Okay, fair enough. I thought you might have been kidding because I thought the solution you proposed sounded complicated. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:10:08
Gold is deflationary. Its price is fairly stable. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:08:27
Great to hear. Are you running your own node/lightning node? I have 100Mb down/50Mb up so I’d like to run a raspberry pi in the garage, but I don’t know what the costs would be. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:54:45


Wow... really??
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:48:28
Genuine time?
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:59:22
(sigh) you mean, like anyone else in this sub?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:55:13
Well I'm sorry that you don't have words. What he said was accurate. Bitcoin is no longer being mined with GPU's. If your argument is: 'well people are mining alt-coins in order to trade for Bitcoin', then it's a bad one. So what if they are?
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:22:25
Ha! I love it... if the symbol is at the beginning of a number it denotes dollars; $15... if it's at the end, it denotes Satoshi; 65,000$.
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:26:22
hmm... why is that?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:46:18
Precisely what I am proposing. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:34:21
I thought you were being a dick! I missed the joke, sorry!
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:33:14
And yet the moderators removed your comment. Next.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:47:46
Dude, don't let them give you shit. You were *not* dumb. At the time you thought that this Bitcoin thing had run its course, and that you could always buy back in at a later date. It turns out now, that that was a bad move. But had the market crashed to $70 the next day, you would be dancing in the streets for having seen in coming. We all like to think that we should have known, the truth is if anyone could accurately predict the next ten fucking minutes they could be the wealthiest person on earth. Don't sweat the past, brush yourself off, and let's go.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:58:02
We're done.
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:55:35
Fair enough! I should have clicked him, before I criticized him. I didn't know.
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:49:10
You don't consider patterns or Fibonacci retracements? That sort of thing? You just get it when it looks like it's going up, and get out when it looks like it's going down? I'd love to get more details on your actual strategy and thought process.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:02:27
Thanks! As soon as I find out what a BIP is, I'm going to write one!
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:49:34
Umm... all-day free trading. That's why.
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:05:59
So, Bitcoin is... BBS?
LN is Altavista...
What does the Google of Bitcoin look like?
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:59:41
Well, I'm down af, right now.. would love to learn how to do what you're doing.
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:07:30
Fortunately, you don't know shit, and we don't care who you are.

"I don't think you realize how much research I do about this stuff"
lol, this is the shit!

I was there for both. This is worse.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:41:07
Well, I'm done with Forbes. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:22:43
It is the same thing with regard to the choice of spending that money or waiting.
Dude, gold is deflationary right? Then why would anyone ever sell any of it?
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:05:16
Nice. I've been in since 2013 at $105. Watched the market collapse to $67. Then it spiked to $1000, and then collapse again. Threw my couple coins into cold storage and forgot about them. Thought maybe these will be worth something some day. Thought someday would be when I was an old man.
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:16:56
In this thread; far too many people that can’t disagree with someone without name-calling, attacking, and even going so far as to discuss the problem in terms of when someone should be silenced.
Jesus, Dave Rubin is lukewarm at best. Settle down. You don’t have to like him or listen to him.  I don’t, but I’m thrilled that he’s using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:18:38
I liked the idea of using a safety deposit box until a redditor correctly pointed out that they can be seized by the government for... whatever reason they do that sort of thing.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:22:05
Yeah, that's the problem. The customers are too stupid to get how great our product is!
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:32:55
Yeah, agreeing to forfeit is not confiscation.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:03:58


@_date: 2018-02-04 09:49:08
Fuck man, a little sympathy?
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:44:27
As well as the naming similarities of the two projects; BitGold/BitCoin.
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:23:02

Are you meaning Biased?
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:07:40
That's for sure. I could have been more clear, and they could have been civil.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:00:28
Lightning network will make our digital gold spendable. Right now, it's heavy, and expensive to move.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:22:36
I didn’t mean to be. I find the arguments sophomoric. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:47:36
Nice! Thanks for the link. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:10:06
Bank transfer. It takes like 10 days, but there’s no fee. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:52:12
Well, not anymore, and certainly not with lightning... but keep it up, you're doing a great job.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:10:32
Thank you for the kind words, I will do that!
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:27:22
Okay, yeah. I actually do like that as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:22:37
Oh, wow. That never crossed my mind. That could be it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:16:28
Oh you're qualified in finance? Would you explain how Bitcoin is a bigger pump than the U.S. Dollar? Or did you just want to say 'I'm qualified' and leave it at that?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:19:02
Your comment: a prick being sarcastic while missing content *and* context. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:10:16
omg your right... lol. fixed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:10
I don't know. regular readers X $100... how much could that affect a market as big as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:30:07
I agree, the names I’ve offered are terrible. Katoshi is kinda clever. I like that 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:25:52
Holy shit! If that’s true, I didn’t know!
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:32:00
I listed ‘creation’ in the attributes. We on the same page. My post is addressing philosophies being conflated. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:51:41
Honest question; can a world where Bitcoin is successful exist? If so, what is it about Bitcoin that is tenable where Liberland is not?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:46:04
I give up, source please.
Edit: nevermind, got it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:16:53
Ahh, yeah. I like that too. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:46:42
So, if I don’t accept the claim that 9/11 was an inside job, it must be that I live in the matrix and am threatened by the truth.
Got it.

I’m with you 100%. Large institutional money will stabilize the price, making it much more useful as a currency, but taking some of the excitement away.

The fact you could be taking my position and mocking our current decimal limitations is pretty funny. Less decimal places are better than more, but they still suck. No one wants to do math.

Okay, I don’t mean people would buy a GPU mining rig *over* an ASIC, what I mean is, people my choose to no longer invest in dedicated hardware to mine Bitcoin, but may still use hardware they already own.

~~wow, four other idiots upvoted you, so I guess you win!~~
~~Wait, no you don't. I'll explain;~~
Edit: way too harsh, excuse me. I think OP *is* asking a question worth talking about, and this would be my best guess:
What OP was asking was; ‘from a technical analysis point of view, how long does Bitcoin need to float around 10k for it to establish a very-strong long-term support level'.
I don't know the answer, but I do know that the longer it stays there, the more likely it is that what he's asking is achieved.

I don't mean to offend. But, you don't want to say 'insure' unless you're talking about insurance. You mean to say 'ensure'.

If it can be seized by the state (like land, or any other real property), it’s not really permission-less. It just permission you don’t think about.
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:29:17
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. I wasn't suggesting that he memorize the 24 words. I was saying that there should the least amount of complications to his backup as possible.

Is that your video?
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:31:43
This is true. There you have a good point. Possible downfall is that a dictionary can be tossed believing that it is no longer needed. Whereas a cryptic note is unlikely to be discarded without inquiring as to what it is.
@_date: 2018-07-08 10:25:47


By what measure? Six months? 'Cause that's the only one you've got.
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:50:30
My friend, your equation doesn't account for individuals or groups that wish to operate with greed. And it doesn't account for those that wish to enjoy the fruits of society's offerings without doing anything themselves.
It also doesn't account for any distribution model. As in how does the bread get from my oven to your dinner table? Who does that for free? What if I don't have enough bread for them too? What if they don't want bread, but need their car's oil changed? Even if everyone cooperates (which is in itself, impossible), this thing falls apart due to its endless complexity. People would never get what they wanted or needed in time.
I sincerely don't mean to be rude, but I honestly thought you were trolling me.
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:22:03


It isn’t brainwashing that informs my view, it’s engineering and economics.
Organisms and species that fail to compete for limited resources DIE. Evolution does yield amazing final products, but kills vast majority along the way.

Really? Even looking at the last two halvings?

Right on, man.
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:12:14


eehhhhh.... that's not really true.
There's WANs, LANs, Tor...
But even if you want to argue that point... 'Cryptocurrency' would be what is to money what in the internet is to information.
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:18:23
Thanks, I love it
@_date: 2019-09-05 23:42:11
Yeah, a great concept with volunteers working on it could turn out to need no external support at all.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:28:37
Well, to *get there* I think we're going to need to make the product more accessible...
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:12:24
Well, for one... why?
What advantage is there is complicating the way the information is stored. The general theory around word seeds is, the simpler the better. Every single suggestion that u/BeTeeC gave you I would advise against.
If your backup method allows you to recover your Bitcoin, even if you had a memory wipe and lost *everything* you know, then you have a good backup. Any conditions on that statement (password protecting the wallet, extra words, special order) increases the security of your wallet, while decreasing the probability of you being able to retrieve it. Keep in mind, 'increasing' and 'decreasing' does not say how much, only that it does.
Depending on how much you have stored, I would have varying degrees of discomfort with *any* extra step should your memory should fail you.
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:10:49
Fair enough. I’m pissed that they’re doing it, not that they can.
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:32:40
Yeah, there’s no toll on a road that no one drives on. Think about why the fee is lower dude. 
And please, don’t make up shit. The fees have been well under a dollar for over a year now
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:58:03
Very good!
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:43:29
I think those laws would only apply to securities regulated by the federal government. This is the other side of the coin in having no regulation.
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:31:04

Craig Wright is on the left, he claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of Bitcoin) but has been unable to provide any proof whatsoever. Roger Ver is on the right, he 'forked' off of Bitcoin, and claimed that that fork *was* Bitcoin, and did a bunch of shady things that cause a lot of confusion for newcomers to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:58:42


Fundamentally, I don't like these sorts of 'hidden in plain sight' kind of solutions. I think it is much more satisfying to know that your private keys are safe, have always been safe, and they have never been even so much as compromised by any of their data being leaked in any way at all.
I do like your dictionary idea though... way way *way* more likely to be missed by a potential thief than a piece of steel with random words scratched on it.

You can avoid fees at an exchange if you’re a little patient. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:23:00


If the supply was limited to say 10 BTC per min after this next halving... sure. I think you're underestimating the frenzy that is to come over the next 10-20 years when the only coins available are from people who mine for a living and can't produce enough for the demand, and those who *have* to sell, but don't want to.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:36:49
Weird, they deleted the tweets that gave the public address from the twitter feed.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:26:32
Honest question; in what reality would there be no need for money?
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:09:46
I hope everyone in this sub realizes that their virtue is irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:49:53
Okay, fair enough.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:23:28

@_date: 2018-07-31 11:00:38
That makes perfect sense. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:53:59
No, I'm with you. I would love to be able to generate a cold-storage address with 100% zero-chance that it could be compromised. My understanding is yes, you can flip a coin (or used dice), the problem comes when you want to create the public key, and then the address. Both of those require insane amounts of calculations, that even if you were inclined, any error could result in you losing control to that address. Unless I'm wrong due to error-checking? Anyone know?

Does this mean that I can confidently tell my friends who bring up quantum computing issues with regard to Bitcoin, that as long as they use a modern wallet, there are no issues to be concerned with?
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:22:37
Wait, why September? I've had a bet with someone since January that we'll break 20k by Halloween, so that would be great timing.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:34:19
Yeah, I said 99%. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:08:43
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:07:33
lol np man, been there
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:24:51
Because no one loses faith after significant gains.
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:12:37
Terrible comparison, and you know it.
@_date: 2019-09-05 23:30:15
That's a great model, actually. What do you do for a living?
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:55:47
Exactly this. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:33:23
So... without gold being used as money, gold is worthless?
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:10:36
I think he's saying that one day you may be able to buy an ounce of gold from a street vendor for $5 because of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:37:25
I agree. Are you saying no change is needed?
@_date: 2018-07-30 03:32:06
I passed at $0.19 because it “wasn’t backed by anything”. 
@_date: 2019-09-20 06:09:41
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:15:30


This is absolute bullshit... don't even think about giving them any more money.... it's a scam top to bottom.
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:22:09
Agreed, but we'll have a price in the hundreds of thousands per coin for that to be reality.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:45:16


I need Turbo Tax Premier to add income from bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:42:13
I'm pissed that they're doing it, not that they can.
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:32:54


TOTAL TX COUNT	0
TOTAL UNSPENT	No outputs
0 Transactions
I hope it stays that way.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:43:01
That's pretty good. Maybe we put it to music or something.
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:06:09
@_date: 2019-09-05 23:15:08
Sorry, Marc... not quite. They couldn't have seized them if Ross had a goddamned hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-06 02:00:12
*can* use
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:25:39
Honestly, other people may have better advice, but I bought a laptop and installed Linux in it. I felt much safer directly interacting with my bitcoin on a machine that was used for nothing else.  
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:35:28
I'm so sorry. That sounds brutal. I read about Bitcoin in I think 2010, at $0.26... I told my friend 'I don't care about this because it's not backed by anything'. Sheesh.
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:33:59
@_date: 2019-09-08 08:23:13
What does that mean?
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:57:03
Did you see this?
Do you still feel that way?
@_date: 2018-07-08 08:34:18
Whoah, that's actually compelling.
@_date: 2018-07-08 10:24:47
So, did you buy the dip?
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:00:18
How do you generate your private key without *some* gadget?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:19:43
Yes. And since a new car will be worth 80% of its sale price as soon as you drive it off the lot, no one will ever buy a new car. 
Edit: Sorry, thought you were making a different point. 
Okay, follow-up question; do you think that’s a good thing? Artificially incentivizing spending and punishing savers for tax revenue?
@_date: 2019-09-08 11:09:21
thank you!
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:03:30
It isn't.
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:06:41
...yeah that's pretty bad.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:23:50
I think atomic swaps will only increase traffic to Bitcoin. So long as the tech remains relatively unchanged, the king will remain.
@_date: 2019-09-07 07:58:09
@_date: 2019-09-20 21:39:52


@_date: 2019-09-27 04:11:29
What a pretentious response. This reminds me of debating the religious. You don’t offer evidence, but instead imply that it is a shortcoming on my part that prevents my understanding. 
My friend,  if what you are saying is true... why don't we have this system already?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:53:33
Ouch. I sold/gave away 66% of what I held back when they were $100. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:50:10
I love Bitcoin, and I love that you love it. But I don’t think you have a very clear understanding of what investing and speculating means. 
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:41:52


lol love it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:13:16
Oh, maybe, I have no idea.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:23:03
It’s not accurate to call it a custodial wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:26:33
Ahh, that's a good point.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:11:02
Mark my works?
@_date: 2018-07-11 04:38:35
Honest question; have you considered what happens if you are killed in a car accident tomorrow? Does you wife or kid know that the fake-graded problem is worth a significant amount of money?
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:08:50
Soooooo, bullish?
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:18:06
Hmm interesting.
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:20:11
Too much woo for me. Let's come back to this conversation in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:21:35
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:50:55
What is iii?
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:04:59
One of the best comments I've ever seen in this sub.
@_date: 2019-09-05 23:28:42
Yeah, he could do an external ssd though, that's what I did. Old laptop, new Samsung 1Tb SSD, the whole thing was less than $200.
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:39:06
So is the *image* stored in the blockchain forever? Or the *link* to the image? (honest question)
@_date: 2019-09-29 11:57:03
Blue Wallet isn't custodial. You can point it to your own node.
@_date: 2019-09-12 10:11:36
hope you're right
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:52:11
I think you’re missing the point that it’s easy to raise money for something that’s discrete, but difficult to raise money for something that’s abstract.
@_date: 2019-09-06 10:01:28
Do you think everyone in this sub is living at home with their mothers? You have no idea what sort of people are members of this sub.
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:17:11
But, they’re uploading their *public* key. How could they get busted from that?
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:16:30
Yes. Prices can ‘fall through flroors’. It happens all the time. Bitcoin just did this last year when it fell through the floor at $5800.
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:15:55
We were before you got here, we will after you're gone... next time just say 'thanks'.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:48:58
I like this answer the most. Funny, you have no upvotes at all.
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:19:19
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:15:50
4%? Just purchased on coinbase for like 1.4%.
Edit: Nevermind, you must be talking about using a credit/debit card.
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:12:30
Define wealth. Then define fiat.
Look at the world however you want, their view is no less valid than yours.
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:09:41
That was my next point.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:38:41
We did it r/bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:06:55
Fair enough
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:38:27
I love this so much
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:11:16
Where did the 6.15 amount come from? I'm on here every day, but somehow missed it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 10:57:51
so deep so deep put her butt to sleep
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:10:44
That's interesting.
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:58:22
Honest question, why are you saying that?
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:04:41
This is a perverted view of what money is.
Here. Try this. Take money out of the equation altogether. I make sourdough bread... want some? You do? Cool, would you help me with some of my yardwork? My back is killing me right now and it hurts to bend over. You will? Awesome, here take an extra loaf.
That's commerce. There's nothing wrong with trade, and there's wrong with a medium of exchange to facilitate trade. So many of you look forward to this world without money. The only scenarios I can imagine where money does not exist, are terrifying.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:56:21
Fascinating. Thanks for the link. I got swept up with that!
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:57:05
I am so pleased that this interests you, and that this conversation is happening! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:43:21


I *just* bought a car where this happened. I paid $8700. The deal was for cash... and we were at a pizza place. He tried counting about half of it in his lap before giving up and saying let's leave so I can do this in the car.
Bitcoin would have been so, so much better.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:36:06
Yeah, I suppose if bits are already supported that makes sense. I didn’t know that. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:52:40


That will work until it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:17:53
Wow the CTO! =)
Thanks for addressing the question! 


So that I'm clear, you're saying that that is something someone could do if they were running Android, right? But with iOS, there's no way to test or know anything, right?


The irony is I actually feel more comfortable using Bitcoin on an iPhone, than I do on an Android. My concern is that there is no recourse if something is exploited.
Thank you again!
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:41:54
Wait, that’s the goal? $9,000 to settle any transaction on the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:30:34
Thank you! This might sound really stupid, but if you guys were to make a short, time-stamped video of the process of updating the software to Apple, and then upload it to youtube, I think it would go a long way in removing concerns about how and who updated the software.
Do you know what I'm saying? I mean, if I was on the bread team, I would be perfectly comfortable keeping all of my funds on the wallet as well, as I would have first-hand knowledge that there was nothing funny going on.
Apple has a lot more to lose if someone at Apple modified your code and stole a bunch of Bitcoin.
Whereas, I don't know how large your team is, but, 'all the money stored on breadwallets' divided by 'number of bread team members' is more than enough for at least the possibility for one of the greatest heists ever.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:49:51
Honest question: why is that?
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:29:10


My concern isn't with my practices... =)
It's strange that we both feel comfortable using Apple's closed system for our most important operations, but would never even think of using Windows.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:47:15


I don't want to be 100% completely sure... I want to know if I'm an idiot for keeping large amounts on a closed piece of hardware, of if there are any 'administrative' checks in place that prevent (or make very difficult) someone compromising the code sent to Apple.
And don't I also have to fear the same issues with Trezor or another hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:15:36
Fuckin’ deep. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:17:42
Isn't that the path we've been on since 1933 though? I mean, if you adjust for inflation on a long enough timeline, even if if the dollar survives does it not continue to lose buying power?
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:28:01
Yours is the best answer. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:26:21
You're welcome at my parties anytime He's dark, but dank.
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:50:47
Even 2.5% growth/week puts us at over 20k by the end of the year. Just fine with me. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:57:27
Shouldn't we see a huge spike from this here at some point?
@_date: 2019-09-07 07:58:47


I think it is.
@_date: 2018-07-31 04:43:29
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:08:23
@_date: 2018-04-30 21:37:14
No, you’ll be told you’re wrong. Again. As already noted in this thread, the fees were about 7 cents.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:43:47
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:56:17
Good points. Yeah, my reluctance to move my entire balance to my breadwallet is primarily centered around the breadapp itself, and its security/prevention of malicious code. I think it's ironic that the mantra of 'Don't trust, verifiy' defines Bitcoin itself... but when it comes to easily *using* it, we are back to trusting multiple entities in the process.
I should note; for me this entire conversation started because I *want* to move my balance to bread, because I honestly believe that it is safer to use a 'hotware wallet', than it is to generate/keep paper wallets in your house where they can be lost, burned, damaged by water, or stolen.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:10:34
Or... holding like there’s nothing *but* tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:55:26
what did it say?
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:45:22
Tell us the fuckin' joke!!
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:35:57
What's the need in holding them close to your chest? That seems anti-... well anti-everything good.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:48:12
wow... ok
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:12:51


Fair enough. Would you consider me a fool for trusting Bread on iOS?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:14:05
This is great. Saving what you wrote.

@_date: 2019-05-28 13:23:27


There's absolutely nothing about what I'm saying that is meant to sound deep.
So that we're clear, I've been member of this sub since 2013. I'm on your side. I didn't want you to think that I was anti-Bitcoin because I said 'you people are hilarious'. That said, I can appreciate the fact that anytime there is an increase in demand for something, whether that be an iPhone, a firearm, or a generator... price tends to go up. I'm not justifying the actions of the 'scam artists' because their actions don't *need* justifying. Bail bondsmen do the same thing... they capitalize on the fact that you really really need something now. The entire world works this way. For me to point out that it is a product of supply and demand (in this example, demand for money transfer services) is completely accurate. Maybe I got downvoted because I sounded heartless. I don't know. I do know that I'm right, and everyone who understands my point will be in a better position to understand any situation where there is a price assigned to something.
I think it's particularly relevant to this sub...
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:22:07
This is the most interesting answer to the question that I've seen.
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:58:09
I want to get paid in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:52:49
Yes, *but the computer it is connected to*, does.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:04:51
I've always thought the 'coddle' was so awkward, and obviously wrong... but it seems like the community is rather divided on this.
Like 'gif'.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:40:35
I think corrections are inevitable. But if I had told you in January of 2017 that there would be a bull market, and then it would eventually crash down to $3300... you would have been ecstatic.
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:37:37
Hey, I did! Thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:52:51
Well, now I'm completely paranoid with no clue how to proceed.
@_date: 2019-05-04 07:46:31


Not true. They got rid of gold because it was too restrictive.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:04:18
I tried doing this... I don't think I succeeded.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:28:12
I don't know. Explain why nobody cares about bcash.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:22:03
What is that meme image from?
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:21:04
Done :)
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:37:45
Why does it not make sense?
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:25:41
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:05:52
Sure. DCA is often touted as giving the investor an *advantage*. That’s what I’m addressing.
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:45:17
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:32:35
Yeah, thank you, someone else caught my error too. I'm living through it rather than fixing it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:02:09


You completely agree that debt is slavery?
@_date: 2019-05-04 06:32:57
Yes, more stable. But it loses about 3% each year, where as Bitcoin tends to increase in value over time.
Course, you knew that.
What I don't know is WHY THE HELL YOU ARE HERE.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:00:26
This looks great! Thank you.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:12:23


And also take the risk of holding an asset that can plummet in value at any time.
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:44:33
Why does it not make sense?
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:20:21
Who cares?
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:17:32
Oh my god, shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:31:57


@_date: 2019-05-21 03:45:37
So air-gapped... but not.
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:48:15
Yeah, that's logical.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:08:34
It’s from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:59:41
Debt is not slavery. That's retarded.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:16:35


Hmm... are you a capitalist? If so, I think we're on the same page. If you're *not*, I'd ask you what it is that you think is happening in shithole countries that is keeping the poople unbanked, and oppressed.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:09:41
Fuckin’ decimals, am I right?
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:00:09
Wait, if we move completely to segwit, that means you can no longer prove that you control an address by signing a message?
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:05:13
Wealth that can be stolen with no trace makes you a target/friends that know your holdings now can use what they know as leverage for... who knows what.
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:44:08
And this time we've got volume
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:24:41
You’re right. Closer to $60,000.
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:56:15


Oh, so like gold. Got it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:08:14
Yeah, forget that. My advice; figure out what percentage of your total capital you're comfortable watching go through the roof, or fall flat on its face. Depending on your age and other factors, that might be as little as 5% or as much as 80%. You can always adjust the amount you have invested if the price changes drastically, and therefore affects the percentage that you prefer/are comfortable with.
Buy your Bitcoin (if you're interested in privacy/keeping your bitcoin off the grid, you'll need to research that separately).
Get a hardware wallet *from the manufacturer's website*.
Transfer your bitcoin to your hardware wallet.
Write down your word seed on several pieces of paper, and keep them in places that no one can *ever, ever* find, because if they do, your bitcoin is now their bitcoin.
Feel free to message me with specific questions.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:35:31
My advice is to buy as much as he wants whenever he wants. It’s not that DCA is bad, it’s that there is no advantage to using it. To be fair, I have had this argument many times, and it’s possible that I am directing criticism toward you that is unjustified because you are not making specific claims that others have.
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:01:17
Really I'm not fretting. It's an individual choice that might be informed by a number of factors. By your reasoning, as long as my old Dell laptop from 2011 isn't connected to the internet, then I can just install electrum on it, and skip the whole expense of a hardware wallet altogether. You wouldn't wrong, but it's possible to be more right.
@_date: 2019-05-04 08:39:08
Buying power.
Goods and services.
Basics are that way ----&gt;
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:05:34
Haven’t seen that rumor, link?
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:11:31
It's also terribly ironic that the submit buttons say 'NOT about price', when the price of Bitcoin is *the most important* aspect of its existence, and always will be.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:51:54
Fail. You have no idea who this person is that's asking for help. Please keep in mind that you are a representative for all of crypto for a lot of people who are new to this.
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:18:23
Hi oldschool.
Technically all Bitcoin is decentralized, what is being discussed in this post is whether or not you are handing over control to someone else in order to safe-guard your Bitcoin.
To answer the heart of your question, yes, if you did that your Bitcoin would be stored decentralized, and YOU would be the only one with the private key able to *move* that Bitcoin.
Keep asking questions and reading posts here and around, you'll pick it up really fast. If you have any other specific questions about how any of this works, feel free to message me.
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:25:28
I'm not confused. Gold can be called a currency without it having the common properties of a currency. In case *you're* confused, what I'm saying with this post is that even if Bitcoin serves only as digital gold, it has succeeded.
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:33:56
lol yeah
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:59:59
love it
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:46:23
I'm working on something to address this issue. I'll report back when it's ready.

Umm, ‘however low the possibility’ is billions to one. For all practical purposes, it’s impossible. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:46:40
Explain what you mean by codes. Bitcoin doesn't have any codes. Are you thinking there *should* be?
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:17:11
Awesome. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:03:13


If your model requires this, you can start over with a new model.
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:48:24
Then his best move is to not buy at all at this time.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:58:27
Well if it's 'Of course' then it's misleading to describe it that way.
@_date: 2019-05-18 05:47:43


That’s a little hyperbolic. Instead, play the game the same way no matter where you are at the time. Make the best decisions you can with the information you have, and never play results. Stand by your choices, and strive to make better ones every day.
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:27:43


yeah, no.
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:20:12
It's always a good time to buy Bitcoin. I don't know what your alts are, but I can honestly say that all things being equal, you are far better off dumping all of them and buying Bitcoin.
There is one king, and Bitcoin be his name.

You can demonize the selective pressures of the world around you, or you can accept them for what they are, in order to better understand.
The more you feel, the less you understand.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:11:05
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:00:33
That’s a good rule.

@_date: 2019-05-11 06:48:11
Same here, I'll buy $200 if it hist $7100.
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:45:51
You think investing $40,000 in Bitcoin makes you a casual investor?
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:59:31
Okay, so Bitcoin has a built-in supply control of the total 21 million bitcoin that can ever exist. That supply control works like this:
For the first four years of Bitcoin's operation, 50 new bitcoin will be 'found' every 10 minutes. The next four years will reduce the amount (the amount is called the 'block reward' by the way) by 50% down to 25 bitcoin every 10 minutes. The four years after that... a 50% reduction again which brings us down to 12.5 bitcoin every 10 minutes. That's the period of time that we're in right now. But in a little less than a year, we will move in to the next four-year period, and the block reward will be halved again, reducing the amount found every 10 minutes to 6.25 bitcoin. 
is saying that because of this decrease in supply, and because the last two bull runs have also preceded the last two halvings, now is a very good time to buy.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:06:55
You're wrong, and OP is right. These images don't hurt Bitcoin's credibility, but they certainly create confusion. I have had the same question about Bitcoin, and know the frustration of debunking the things they think they know.
It's not a huge deal, but it doesn't help us either.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:33:29
Lol, my advice *can’t* age poorly. I’m arguing that there is no benefit to breaking up your investment over time. So, if anything, from your perspective, if we play the last 24 hours backwards, it is your advice that would not have been as beneficial, as he would have missed out on the gains of a lump sum investment. 
Keep in mind, I’m not arguing that, I’m refuting your point that my advice was bad.

Mixing refers to anything that makes it difficult to determine the source of your Bitcoin, by combining it with a bunch of other user's Bitcoin. This can now be accomplished best with Wasabi Wallet. The most common way before that was to send your coins to a mixing service, that would charge a small fee, obfuscate your coins with other's coins, and then hopefully send you the same amount of Bitcoin you sent them.

Supply, and demand.
edit: lol downvoted for pointing out the obvious. You people are hilarious. Are the movie theater concession stands disgusting when they mark up a candy bar by 450%? Or is *that* supply and demand, but when it makes you sad we'll call it something else...?

What gif was it?
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:24:34


There is no advantage to this strategy. Any losses prevented are equally likely to result in missed gains.
Edit: I missed this part of your comment before I responded:


If what you say is true, he is still better off buying as much as he can now and *not* utilizing DCA.
Dollar cost averaging can never provide an advantage, it can only decrease swings.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:25:35
Oh, it's possible. It's just not happening.
And if it *did* it would result hard fork.

How are governments manipulating the market? 
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:10:43
*Spending* from an public address multiple times is the issue. Not receiving. As long as the amount you have received is not an amount that you're uncomfortable sharing with anyone who cares to look it up, you're fine.
So, in other words; one shirt per spend.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:58:01
Bitcoin has value itself. As digital information capable of of manipulating Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network. This makes possible the communication of value from one person to another, anonymously, without permission, and with zero counter-party risk.


I don't completely agree with him, but if you're going to make utility arguments for gold, you should do the same for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:30:35
The term you are wanting there is 'full disclosure'.
*I am not a bot, correcting people happens automatically.*
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:28:04
yeah.... buuuut, *not really*. If you have to connect your hardware to a PC with an internet connection in order to send your Bitcoin, then it's not exactly offline. If that were true, you could plug your Trezor into a power brick, and enter whatever codes were needed into the Trezor website.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:06:32
You, along with everyone else, has absolutely no fucking idea what's going on. Just stop.

Honest question. If you believe that, what are you doing in this sub??
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:42:01
It's true.
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:59:56
That's my point. You *can't* minimize risk with DCA without also minimizing gains.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:56:05
Oh, to have such problems.

Is this a joke? I didn’t know this was happening. How do I get started?
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:35:26

No problem, thanks for being cool.

You can’t be serious.

@_date: 2018-12-14 22:41:43
When did this happen in the past for far less money?
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:18:43
I need to get my Bitcoin onto a hardware wallet. But I don't like the idea of having to connect to a PC via usb Trezor-style, and since I'm iOS, I wouldn't even be able to use a Trezor with my phone anyway.
I'm interested in a coldcard (coldcardwallet.com), because it allows true off-line signing of transactions, which I feel like, if you're going to invest in a hardware wallet, why would you not want this function?
My reservation is, I watched a video for the process of signing a bitcoin transaction... and... oh my god... it seemed so damn complicated.
My question is, is there an easier hardware wallet that I can sign offline with? And has anyone else had any experience with that wallet to advise me in any way...
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:00:55
Just with Bitcoin though, right?
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:23:25
Be right back, I have to pull $400 out of bluewallet.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:41:07
To be fair, *Bitcoin* is too good to be true.
@_date: 2019-05-19 07:33:35
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:14:00
It’s not about them being smart. He saying Bitcoin is often misunderstood even by those in the space, so for a mainstream publication to ‘get it’ is surprising and refreshing. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:44:30
Great. Then the short-term EV is negative, and no one should invest, and those who are invested should sell.
It's like you're in a casino where there's a game that consistently pays you $1.10 every time you flip a coin on heads, but takes a dollar from you every time it falls on tails. That is a game you want to play all day, every day, for as much money as they will let you wager.
Conversely, if there's another game at another table that has the same rules but you *lose* a quarter every time you flip heads and a *dollar* every time you flip tails... then no amount of minimizing risk should ever make you want to play that game.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:27:21
He’s joking about all of it.

@_date: 2013-07-04 06:17:05
Same here. It's hard not to tie Bitcoin's value to its price.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:29:16
Thank you. What Bitcoin needs right now... is the equivalent of a stock split. I would be more inclined to buy  250,000 "bits" for $200 *and I understand bitcoin!*

@_date: 2018-12-07 10:26:46
Thank you... I'm numb now... so I'm okay. I hope everyone else is okay too.
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:03:19
That’s not how Bitcoin addresses work. You can’t ‘mess up a single character’ and lose your money. There are built-checksums against errors like that. It can’t happen. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:50:42
Of course! I should have said 'potential world internet commerce'.

Guess what, no one else knows either.
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:55:40
You got downvoted for that? Really?
Look if you can only buy bitcoin from a shady guy who carries a gun at 2:15 in the morning, and this night-owl gun-toting bitcoin-dealer only takes money orders issued from the post office... it's a problem for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:58:04


How is that evil?

Or if the attacker has a keylogger installed on your system.

@_date: 2019-05-01 09:12:41
Think of it this way. When Google IPO'd at $85 per share, those that recognized the company's value bought and HODL'd that stock... when they sell if for $500 per share and by a Lambo, they are rewarded for their correct assessment of it's value.

Does cocaine do anything for the economy? Do Magic the Gathering cards?
Of course Bitcoin does something useful for the economy! if it didn't its value would be $0.

Wow, I didn't know about that.
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:21:43
That’s ironic. I work as a table games supervisor (casino), but have always loved code and the idea/beauty of code, and have always felt like I missed my calling.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:15:01
Came here to say this.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:13:58
Agreed. "Virtual" tends to have a 'trick-the-system', 'it's not real', connotation. "Virtual Network", "Virtual Reality", "Virtual Pet".

What the hell is this from?
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:13:08
Great, then how do the traders trade? Figure that out. Until you have a viable alternative, banks are going to bank.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:15:51
Do I need both the public key and the private key in order to access the coins at that address? Or will just the private key suffice?

@_date: 2019-05-12 06:48:30
...what the hell

Wow. Had no idea.
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:05:30
During my own attempt at creating a gold-backed digital currency, I read up on PayPal's original idealistic goals. It's amazing how far from there they wound up.

This is cute, but most people do both.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:25:55
Fair enough. Yeah, relatively new here.
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:22:32
I didn't imply that Bitcoin ought to be modeled after US currency, my argument is that it should be simplified.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:14:48
Why not simply ask Bitcoin-paying customers to deposit an amount likely needed to cover the meal when they arrive?
The check comes, and let's say the restaurant owes the customer $35 dollars after the meal, so the restaurant sends it to any address they like as they're walking out the door.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:05:20
Where do you see that?
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:57:23

Or it's because he *is* Satoshi!

Oh. Yet is very different from can’t.
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:13:51

This is a good answer. Instinctively, I would have said that its inability to be counterfeited, and its finite number makes it an excellent contender as a medium of exchange.

I've heard this proposed before, and I don't get it. What am I missing... how would you even do that?
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:43:00

This exchange was the opposite of every other disagreement on the internet. Both parties were polite and respectful, and at the end everyone befitted through new understanding. I salute you both. 
I hope bitcoin succeeds, if for no other reason than the fact that its supporters deserve it.
@_date: 2013-06-11 02:11:54
I think engineering something like Bitcoin requires more than just having programming skills.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:01:12
Never understood this argument even when it's applied to gold. Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:45:44
If a currency includes the three C's. Can't be Created, can't be Counterfeited, and can't be Confiscated, then the organization that provides it is irrelevant to me.
Unless of course you're right.
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:21:16
That's a damn good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-20 09:55:13
Is this possible with bitcoin yet? I'm new here... but I have concerns with regard to only a keylogger being required to wipe me out of whatever I had in my wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:23:15
Nice, very good point. The price of gold being reflected the same way would go a long way in supporting that theory.

Shit! I missed it too.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:56:14
Alright, you convinced me too.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:37:14
*people with guns* saying it had value.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:36:21
If I had plenty of other millions and believed in the cause? Yes. Elon Musk did.  
@_date: 2013-07-12 06:19:07
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:34:24
Yeah, what does that mean? Could someone catch the typo... and then go and create the mis-typed username for reddit to collect the tip?
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:48:11
I knew that was coming! I was at work on a break-room computer, and the Yahoo home-page had been left open.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:12:55
You got the first part backwards.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:48:39
He probably would.
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:41:59
When I say advantage I mean it in the mathematical sense. A break-even game with less variance, is still a break-even game with no *advantage*.
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:59:44
Wide acceptance and capitalization *is* what will stabilize the price.
@_date: 2013-05-29 09:00:50
I had to google that to find out that was Ayn Rand. I think she unjustly catches a lot of shit. It seems that in the last decade it became really trendy to mock her writing, and her supporters. And that's unfortunate.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:15:03
I have seen that. I'm in the camp that thinks their attempts are irrelevant in the long run an inconsequential in the short. All markets can be manipulated.
@_date: 2013-04-20 08:54:30
I'm new to bitcoin. What are you implying it's capable of?
@_date: 2013-05-29 08:49:31
Welcome! Drive safe.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:39:42


Yeah, I got that.
So just to clarify... I can throw away my address list, and only hold on to the private keys... and I'm fine, right?
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:50:47
Oh. Wouldn't a bookmark be easier?
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:00:09
It depends on the price of the meal, the nature of the friendship, the novelty of the subject of bitcoin, and countless other factors.
@_date: 2013-07-01 10:34:07

Someone else obsessed with the golden ratio.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:30:25
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:59:39
Maybe you can help me understand something.
With regard to the 51% attack, how real is that?
Doesn't the mining difficulty going through the roof severely limit the number of miners to those using very expensive hardware? Does that make the attack easier?
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:34:25
What are you saying could be happening by posting in @_date: 2013-10-02 22:43:33
I see what you're saying. I was thinking that that was his only way of getting to him.
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:12:22
One of the reasons why these arguments seem to make sense is that they remove the relative value of money in order to set up the problem.
Yes if you only have $100, *and your arm is worth more than that to you* then taking a 10:1 risk to save your arm makes sense.
But it stops making sense if you throw in something like: "But if you lose, and you have no money to give him at all, he kills you."

"Money laundering" is a bullshit made-up crime. 99% of the time it refers to the laundering of profits from drug sales of which there should be no laws against in the first place.

I completely agree. What would it take to get rid of the 'micro' and 'mili' crap and simply call 100 satoshi 1 Bitcoin? We brace for the deflation, and let the chips fall where they may.

@_date: 2013-05-15 15:27:39
Excellent point. I agree with completely. Except for one crucial point. For bitcoin to be stable and to have a robust economy, we need wide acceptance.
In other words, we need many new people to join the cult. And if it's difficult for them to sign up, then it's a problem for bitcoin.

I *think* this is how it works.
A (Sender) sends a payment to B (Receiver) *and* to C (Escrow Service)... and we're done.
For the money to be moved at this point, it requires at least 2 of the 3 to agree. 
What I'm not clear on is what the wallet balances look like during this process.

No, it will not. The expected value for every trial will *always* be negative. You cannot add up an X number of negative expectation and expect a positive value.
Try this thought experiment: Instead of you being a player with an infinite bankroll, imagine that you only have $1. But your friend has $2, his friend has $4, his friend $8... and so on, off into infinity. You are all distributed evenly throughout the universe at identical casinos, at roulette tables with no maximum bet. Assume that each of you place your bets at the same time.
It's over.
Do you actually think that you and your infinite friends will have more money than you started with?
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:01:48
Your point is well taken. I just have a minor nit-pik.
It is a 50% chance for a *coin-flip*. But I'm assuming that satoshidice does not offer "even money" wagers, so it would actually be higher than a 50% chance of losing a 7th time. Probably somewhere around 51%.
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:38:00

Perhaps it was easier in this case, because Bitcoin *isn't* a product.

Everything about your argument is fundamentally wrong. (I'm not being a jerk here, I'm wanting to respectfully address your point and hopefully clear up the confusion). You are failing to appreciate that the *expected value* in your scenario is negative for every trial. This means that while technically you are likely to experience standard deviation, from a mathematical perspective at *no time* do you have a chance of "winning small amounts". Not without a positive expectation (counting cards, for example).
Mathematically, the casino doesn't win when the dealer picks up your losing bet and places it in his rack. The casino wins a small percentage of your wager *when you place the bet*.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:24:11
Nothing like being right and downvoted to hell. I don't care about mathematical semantics. My point was that no matter how long the time-line, you will never reach a point where his probability of failure is 100%. It just becomes more and more likely. It will never be absolute.
