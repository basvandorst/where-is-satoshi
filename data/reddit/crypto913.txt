What I mean is that people see bcc as a altcoin and a shitcoin, well if thats the case then what is litecoin supposed to be
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:05:37
Tell me how many shitcoins u have in your wallet? 
Calling this bullshit still lol, ur just mad that it reached half of what BTC is worth in 1 day. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:11:38
I will fook you up mate
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:28:41
Stfu clown, ur probably a mad litecoin investor that is bitching on every reddit post about BCH.

When I complained today about why the jaxx wallet didnt show how much btc I had, some guy of Jaxx replied and told me that we will be able to see our bcc when they have added the option to the wallet

Why are so many people hating on bcc? They see it as a threat thats why! Also the litecoin users are very mad because their coin will not be that important anymore after bcc adoption. HA

Never take advice from "friends". They will run off with your idea and never give you the credit that you deserve. 
And also jealousy is something not to underestimate.  It can really mess someones life up.

Man stop all the bitching about this coin, everyone is just mad that they didnt have more bcc. And now they try to fud others about it

Can both of u fuck off, trying to put that altcoin sub reddit here in a sneaky way. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:08:08
I hope the bch supporters get dumped on hard
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:05:36
They make sure the fud is spread everywhere, where else are they going to fud? Theyre on every cryptocurrency platform shaking out the weak hands. So also on reddit.

Wasting your precious bitcoin on a scam suit? hodl
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:09:36
Just did some research, looks promising

When Bitcoin hit the market first people said the same things, even worse statements. 
I dont know what will happen, but we shouldnt underestimate things that easily. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:24:02
lol well said, people think they can make a difference here in the price. First of all if someone was able to do that they wouldnt be here bragging about it, but probably would tell people the opposite.

How do you know no one is touching BCC? I think people with deep pockets will buy them anyway. While everyone sells them.
