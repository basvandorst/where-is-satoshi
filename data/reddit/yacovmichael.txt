Indeed!

Full disclosure: I had just parked and my buddy came out with those glasses. No drinky and driving for me. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:40:14
Exactly, friend!

They didn’t even ask for a deposit. But, insurance was an issue.

Not rich. Just a fact that I used BTC to acquire this vehicle for the evening. I’ll get a Prius next time... Forgive me.

Please make my friend a meme. Haha

I googled that same question before I went and that’s actually how I found the rental company. There are multiple Bitcoin ATM’s, however, I did not use any.

Many of my friends asked how much it cost and I replied,  “they accept Bitcoin.” None of them even own any crypto, but they all know I do and they were legit happy for me. They liked the car too.

That’d be sad 
Edit: That’d be awesome! 1 BTC = 250,000+ USD

I think the guy with a full head of hair is gonna be the one-upper... That’ll be my next BTC purchase lol
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:23:13
Grow up? I’ve held Bitcoin since May of 2017 and this is the first time I’ve made a purchase with it. Would it be more acceptable if I bought a useless sticker on the lightning network? Hopefully, you can rent a car too with crypto when you get your license... 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:02:30
I can live with that lol

That’s actually my buddy  John Compton. He made it to day 3 of the WSOP, so if you see him on tv send him some good luck! 
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:34:11
I fucking died just now! 
Edit: still dying LOL

Macallan 21yr .. That’s the passenger’s fault. He made it to day 3 of the WSOP.

Can’t say either of us did so well on the tables, but he’s running decent in the Main Event. His group plays again tomorrow.

That is correct! Tell Kahn (black jack dealer) that I said hello. I’m the guy who doubles down on hard 13! 
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:41:05
Edit: I went to Vegas with a group of friends and saw a rental car company that accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment. I couldn’t think of a better way to spend it! They also have BTC ATM’s which is pretty cool. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:36:57
Correct. Spyder
