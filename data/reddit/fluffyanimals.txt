If I were using Cryptsy for my day-to-day transactions in terms of buying food and things along those lines then it'd be a different story, but in using Cryptsy so far the service seems to have been consistently improving, support on the site has resolved all of my tickets quickly, and 90% of the time I've been able to trade error-free and quick. The rest is absolutely infuriating and has made me want to smash my monitor to pieces before, but that still doesn't negate that the vast majority of my experiences on the site have worked quickly and efficiently. Does the bad offset the good to a degree? For sure, but I don't have a bone to pick with Cryptsy because its customer support has always been very quick and efficient for me whenever I've had issues. Clearly the back-end needs to be revised and updated, but I'm willing to gut it out in the meantime in the hope that things will continue to improve.

Last time I was in China (within the last 12 months) I didn't have any trouble accessing reddit, but rather most links on reddit that involved news and the like. So if there was an NYT article it was blocked without workarounds or a VPN, but reddit itself loaded fine. I'm not sure about certain subreddits, though, since I can't remember for sure whether they were blocked or not.

I'd appreciate an invite if possible, please. And my question (since I can't easily find it on my phone unless I'm not trying hard enough):
How soon would your services likely expand to the United States Europe, and other countries? Is there any kind of timeframe you're aiming for or just expanding as you go?

CampBX is supposed to be good from what I've heard but I'm still waiting for my money to get processed (over a week after sending it). In one week they'll have ACH available to deposit money, though, which should improve the situation greatly.

Coinbase won't give you your first coin until four business days have passed but you can still buy it at a cheaper price. Not sure if the initial buy is limited to one coin, but I bought 0.25 last Friday and I won't have access to it or the ability to buy another until this Friday ok Coinbase.
CampBX is upgrading its system to allow for ACH starting Wednesday so you'll probably see a large influx of trades on there come Wednesday (like another poster mentioned).

I've had my fair share of issues with balances being messed up when Cryptsy's site has become slow, nearly unresponsive or taking a long time to process orders or orders not showing up at all. I've submitted three different support tickets to them in the last week and each one has been worked out within a matter of hours at most, and all of my missing balances and trade orders have been appropriately resolved.
Obviously I get very frustrated with the site's issues and it hinders my trade abilities significantly when the site experiences problems, but largely my experience with Cryptsy has still been quite positive overall. It's not without issues by any extent of the imagination but as a whole things seem to be improving on the site.

It may seem expensive now, but if it really takes off then this is a drop in the bucket compared to what it could become.
I knew about Bitcoin back in early 2010 or so and thought "That's interesting but seems really risky. I'll pass for now." Then I saw the major crash in April and kept thinking "Hmmm, still seems like I could lose a lot of money that way." At the end of October I finally decided to get into it (ugh, so much more expensive now) and now I'm awaiting verification from Coinbase since I didn't know it existed until this last week (found lots of other exchanges like CampBX and BTC-e instead). Got a bank account setup for it specifically, getting it verified, and then I'm good to go. I imagine the price will be even higher since the best time to buy always seems to be "yesterday," but I'd rather get in now at what seems like a "high" price than what I'll really want to kick myself over in the future.

This gets posted so often that it should practically be a link on the sidebar by now.

It dropped $20-30 earlier when I was watching it on Coinbase only to quickly rebound up to $413, drop to $408, and then it hovered around $408-409 for a short while before climbing some today.
