Hi , i mean for the upcoming forks , i did not have the ledger before , its new.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:50:26
if i have my btc at my ledger whats the safest way of getting the forked coins? create another seed in a wallet that its going to allow the fork and move them there before it happens? how do you usually proceed?

Lighting network is a fork itself or its an upgrade on the actual bitcoin? or will result in to another coin?

Since my first investment at the end of november i have been puting money and "playing" with some alts till i got to the point to own a whole BTC, so yes i am a noob, each time we go in to a dip i fucking lose it, but still holding.
The reason why i get so nervous? well, i had faith on the technology behind the BTC but the more i learn the more i see that BTC today has no " real value"? technologically speaking , i mean i think that any of the top20 shitcoins out there its better today as a currency than bitcoin is, so my biggest nigthmare is that if people stops believing that BTC has value... then its over because tecnologically its obsolete.
Still holding strong and waiting for segwit adoptation by most of the exchanges(fuck you coinbase) and LN to be implemented.
Any advise is welcome :P

New investor since end of november, after the dips and several investments on different alts i got today 1 BTC.
But the thing is that the more i educate myself the more i see its obsolete techonologically speaking.
Currently any of the top 20 coins works better as a coin than BTC, and only value BTC provides its that everyone thinks it has some value.
Could someone convince me with arguments to not sell it when price goes back to 15k€ or 20k $?
Am i missing something? cos currently i do not see myself paying a coke with BTC in 5-10 years maybe with another coin , but definetly not BTC, and gold 2.0? no... gold cant be created and BTC can be forked by everyone so... why it has value at all appart that the value that people think it has?

Guys dont you think is kind of weird? anyone on this? seems that USDT are being created and filling the exchanges with them, then they buy BTC and alts in order to pump them.
If you check stats on the right side you will see that each time USDT are created there is a BTC pump, yesterday 20KKUSDT and today BTC its over 11k
Tether does not want to admit any audit ... that smells.
If people start selling to FIAT and they created USDT magically... price will go down like crazy.
Is this some kind of SCAM by the exchanges in order to trade up their BTCS for FIAT and then fuck off everyone?
PD:This is a post that a guy on a spanish forum posted and i more or less translated it in to here i want to know your opinion on this.
