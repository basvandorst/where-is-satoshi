I was at home sick for 2 days, made $15k trading. Went to work the next day, and BTC started rallying without me being able to close my positions. Cost me approximately $20k so far. Fuck work, I'm seriously considering just becoming a trader. JUST BTFD! It's so simple..

If BTC crashes to $900, I'm gonna get the fattest, fucking, boner, on earth. I'll be so thick and veiny, you'll all be running for your fucking lives. Fucking money boner!

You literally missed out on $60 fucking bucks. Aka a trip to the movies and 2 beers afterwards...  If you had written $100k, and we were talking about $60k, then I'd understand the frustration.

I honestly get what you're saying, but that's still incorrect imo. Why would you not be able to enjoy life as a young man with hundreds of millions in liquid cash? That literally makes no sense. If I had bought BTC when I first heard of it, instead of blowing $3k on parties and shit, I would now, still be in my mid twenties, with approximately $300 million in my bank account. For me, life is about becoming better, at everything. I can enjoy the ride, and make shitloads of money at the same time. 
For me, it's quite simple.  Money is inherently worthless, but money = time, and time = the most valuable commodity in the universe. 
If I had $100m right now, I'd simply stop working. I would become better at something else. Like, eating pussy. My fiance, if honest, could probably give me a few pointers, but right now, I don't have the fucking time to become a master at eating snatch. I'm busy becoming a master at making fucking fields of green. 
I'm not gonna argue against how shit feels when you're 40, I wouldn't know a damn thing about it. What I can say is that: regardless of age, money is an important factor in realizing your dreams. Also, don't give a shit about lambos, I just want a yacht, and all the time in the world, to eat.. Pussy.
