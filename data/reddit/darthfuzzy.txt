You can easily buy a house for $300k...not even a shit house. A brand new 3br 2ba home in a decent area. You don't need a lambo huracan.
Saying that 300k doesn't buy you shit is the dumbest thing I've heard in awhile.
He could take the 300k and invest it in conservative bonds and in 30 years retire at 50. That's better than 99.99% of people.
Edit: That last paragraph is what you said, in the OP, but saying that 300k isn't a lot in today's world is a dumb statement. That's a lot of money for a 16 year old.

If this post is real, and I highly doubt it is:
Sell it them. Pay the taxes. Invest the rest in a low cost (ETF) moderately aggressive portfolio. Don't touch it for 30-40 years.

There's a big difference. Reddcoin would specifically organize targeted thread spams. You can blame They would specifically coordinate massive individual thread spams on certain posters. When the OPs asked to stop, they would continue and then harass via PMs. The mods had to step in and ban it. 
did a bit giveaway there. TACOcoin is very welcome at So is digibyte and pandacoin.

Reddcoin tipping isn't allowed in because you guys started massive coordinated tipping threads that people were pissed at. If a few people tip, its one thing. When hundreds of people tip with the explicit purpose of spamming after someone says stop, its another.

ETF companies* not trying to be a nitpicky asshole, just Vanguard is a mutual fund company. They offer cheap ETFs and Mutual Funds.

Dogecoin got me into crypto. I wish people would adopt it as the standard to send small amounts of money. It's fun, it's quirky, it's cheap and it's Doge!
The transaction times are also insanely quick.
I guess litecoin kind of fulfils that though.

Their rate of return is 100% dependent on what you own. 
They literally have ETFs for every major index. So, you buy a vanguard s&amp;p 500 ETF, your rate of return is the s&amp;p 500.
They're just a mega mutual fund / ETF company.
If you're looking for a specific portfolio/cheap robo-advisor, go look at betterment, acorns, wealthadvisor, etc. Most of those roboadvisors actually use Vanguard funds in their portfolios.

I concur. I've been seeing consistent gains/drops at what is considered peak Chinese trading times (late evening / early mornings). I wouldn't be shocked it there's another large drop tonight.

Uhhh...if you buy Bitcoin via Coinbase, the price is based on the trade date, not the settlement date of the funds:
