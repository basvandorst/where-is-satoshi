I believe the "Operação Serenata do Amor" deserves some donation. It is a group of hackers that built a software that analyses all the spent made by deputies. They have already found thousands of suspicious and irregular spends and they are creating social pressure on those politicians, actually now that the deputies know that they are being watched they are dealing with public money in a more responsible way and this is huge, Serenata will possibly impact the highly corrupt culture in Brazil. The project is totally open source and english based so anyone, from anywhere in the world, can fork it from github and adapt it to apply in your own country.

Just loved this message. We need to respect more knowledge instead of money, a lot of stupid people has tons of money with no merit and should have no voice or power. (ps. I'm not talking about Roger Ver here).

We need to be very grateful for \user\andreasma work. He taught and introduced a lot of us on crypto, if we are ramping up today he has a lot of credit on this.
