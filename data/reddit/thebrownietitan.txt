Yep, having the same issue. If I set the charts to a one day interval it seems like yesterday was completely erased.

Seems like Coinbase is having some trouble. It has gone down twice in the last 20 minutes or so.

Coinbase supported the fork when it was originally going to happen. They normally will as well. It will happen on block 501451, which will normally happen on the 28th this month.
What will happen is: coinbase will probably halt trading for a few hours beforehand, and suddenly you'll have two chains. One BTC and one B2X. Everyone will get a 1:1 ratio of B2X coins, and then a proportional amount of Satoshi's coins as a reward (?). You'll be able to sell, buy receive and send both. 
Sigwit2x wants to do a couple of things as increasing the block size to 4mb and changing production speed of a block to 2.5 minutes. This should create less fees and make B2X a more viable coin to actually use. Atleast that's how it's intended.

"A correction is a reverse movement, usually negative, of at least 10% in a stock, bond, commodity or index to adjust for an overvaluation. Corrections are generally temporary price declines interrupting an uptrend in the market or an asset. A correction has a shorter duration than a bear market or a recession, but it can be a precursor to either."
From investopedia.com
In ELI5 terms: a correction is when an investment (in this case bitcoin) rapidly grows in price (like we saw today) and then rapidly declines again to correct for that rapid growth in price, which was most likely an overvaluation of Bitcoin's price.
