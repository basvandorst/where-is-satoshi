Don't buy Bitcoin, earn Bitcoin by working for it or mine it

The mempool will kick it back to your wallet if no miner picks it up. If you want it to go through use the replace by fee option in electrum

As soon as you move your Bitcoin out of coinbase into a private wallet. Coinbase will log that as you sold your Bitcoin. So buy Bitcoin then  move it wallet asap. You won't have that much gaina on their books. If you buy and leave it sitting in coinbase while the price goes up then your paying for all the gains

Buffet is a banker, what do you expect him to say, take your money out of the bank and buy bitcoins!?!

Cashless is never gonna happen. Power goes out in California once a month when we have high winds. No power means cash

Blockstream says BTC is for high value, high security transactions. Try litecoin ��

Bio metrics are not secure. If it's convenient it's not secure

This about control of the repo. Core devs vs Bitmain + DCG. Who will mine bitcoin core when all miners goto b2x? Core devs will have change the POW and institute replay protection which makes BTC the fork.

Bitcoin needs users not investors

Closed , centralized, coins can be frozen and declined for redemption and not borderless. Only works at our bank network and permissioned blockchain that can be rolled back or edited. Banksters SMH.  Call it JP's crapcoin. I hope all of their developers leave and work on Bitcoin projects.

Why are your coins on coinbase. If it's not your keys, it's not your coins
@_date: 2019-12-13 07:25:30
Not your keys not your bitcoin

You would be a mobile mining farm. Two semi trucks of miners or cargo containers. Gas to electricity on the cheap. Connect to the 4G or oil rig facility wifi. A Texas blockchain cowboy

Not your keys not your crypto. If core forks Bitcoin to a privacy coin I bet you won't get that fork. It would be corporate bitcoin in that custody account not core

Bitcoin doesn't care. It's math.
