Hey, thanks.

This is a great point. I think there are things to learn from in every economic bubble burst.

Thanks much!

Very cool, thanks! I'll check this out.

Yeah I hope that this is the next step but the infrastructure just isn't quite there yet.

Hey thanks! I appreciate the love.

Yes, you're right. I was more getting at the fact that Futures will get tons of people interested in actually investing in Bitcoin itself.

Easier to find that way, I guess. ;)
But seriously if you have a better suggestion I'm all ears.

That is DOPE. We need more ppl doing cool stuff like this imo.

BTC seeds are 64 characters long...comms bots only allow 42. AND you can only have one active comms bot per planet.

A great question. I wondered the same when I first came across ACT.
Essentially a curation engine is built into the ACT system - it's a decentralized platform for vetting proposals. It rewards curators through a specific algorithm that is made to score proposals that match the majority of the community would consider to be fair.
I'm summarizing from the whitepaper which should be released soon. Exciting stuff!
