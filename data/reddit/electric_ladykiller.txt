I see your point, but are you arguing that a company like Netflix accepting bitcoin would be bad for bitcoin as a currency?  If more people accept it more people will use it as a currency.  It's that simple.  Also Dick Richardhead makes a good point as well.

It is good for bitcoin as a currency though.  Obviously we're not at the point where a company like Netflix is gonna hold BTC, but it's a very popular service that people could be able to use BTC for in the near future. It's another stepping stone to make people in general want to hold BTC rather than cash out for fiat.  Sure any money paid to Netflix will be immediately cashed out but it's still a step in the right direction.

It's NOT a bubble!!!

Eh I think he's just naive or retarded... I can't see how anyone would think that 2 days means bitcoin is a failure.  How much it goes down in the next few days doesn't really mean shit, probably better to get some of the speculative money OUT of bitcoin.  But who am I kidding, I'm just gonna buy some more to hold when it bottoms out.  
Also what does FUD stand for?  I can tell what it means but don't know the acronym

Actually he brings up a good point, you couldn't because there's only 21 million ever being made.  So my statement was inaccurate, bitcoin can handle larger transactions if its value is higher.  But for normal uses I would say my statement still holds up.

Don't get me wrong, I'm trying to make some money here too, but bitcoin is just as useful at $10 a coin as it is at a million.

tI agree with the sentiment expressed by your first sentence, but I don't think speculation is killing anything.  Bitcoin is basically brand new.  If anything, the wildly high prices due to speculation get people to notice it.  There was just a huge bubble, it is bursting, and then values will return to normal and continue to grow at a more reasonable rate (probably)

Some guy invented some sort of liquid sludge that is basically just that, you could probably order it at this point. [Soylent](
I think it's a bad idea to live off this stuff but it has it's place.  Honestly some people's diets are shitty enough that they'd probably be better off with this sort of thing.

The fact that most of the people speculating in cryptocurrency don't know shit about investing is apparent and important.
