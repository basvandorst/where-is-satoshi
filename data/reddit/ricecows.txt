Victims not including the user of substance:
The users family (might have an abusive parent/miss out on time due to rehab. Parent might throw away money on drugs and not use it for food/rent).
The users workplace (the user might not perform well, or even get fired. Workplace needs to find a replacement and train a new employee).
Tax payers (money spent on rehabilitation could've been used on something else. Money spent on police/prison could be spent better).
People caught in the cross fire between cartels/gangs.

It's on a decline compared to yesterday's highs. It's not dropping a lot though, and it seems to be stabilizing.

That's an opinion.

For reference, I'm European and we don't do the whole "war on drugs" in my country.
And you're missing my point. Correct, decriminalization of drugs won't make more drugs available. Trafficking drugs now, today, and selling drugs, today, is in no way a victimless crime. It costs many innocent people their life's both directly and indirectly. 
A decriminalization will not make government spending necessarily larger or smaller, that's not so easy to define.
My point was, that dealing drugs is not victimless. People have died along the way, before the drugs hit the consumer, and many consumers are pushed into criminal activities to finance their use of substances, because prices are high due to the risk the sellers are taking. 
Even if drugs are legal, there will still be victims. Just like there's victims of tobacco and alcohol.

What you're saying isn't wrong, and I also believe that drugs shouldn't be criminalized. However, saying that dealing drugs is a victim less crime in our current day and age, is absolute bollocks. 
Even with a decriminalization of drugs, there will still be people who abuse them and get addicted, and need government financed aid to get back on their feet. This costs money and takes tax money from other areas. 
Many European countries spend a lot of money on government paid rehabilitation centers. Money that could have been used differently if hard drugs weren't available.
