I'm giving your app a try. Been using Blockfolio but hate constantly updating new trades and acquisitions. So far I like the looks and feel. Going to enter my APIs from Gemini, Gdax, CB, Trex, Topia, Liqui, HBTC, and Binance. Will let you know how it goes. Also, I'm loving KuCoin exchange and making a healthy return on holding their KCS so it'd be great to see them integrated in a future update. Nice work!

A great and terrible lesson in value.��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:35:27
Why do you assume I care what the price is as long as it’s above zero? Also, you can’t have been around the cryptosphere long if you think price kills coins. Just look at all the shitcoins that never die. And once again, not everyone is a get rich quick degenerate gambler price speculator. Some of us use bitcoin for more than that and the price doesn’t matter in the big scheme as long as it’s non zero.
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:42:33
This is the weakest shit I’ve ever seen. Either make a point or don’t. As long as it’s above zero it stores value. Period. Think bitcoin will die, sell yours and move on. Otherwise, you really don’t have a point to make here. Words have definitions and you are using them incorrectly.  Pretty much unusable is your opinion but I’ve been using bitcoin since it was worth less than a dollar and it suited me fine then and will suit me fine if t returns to that price. I don’t simply speculate on price, I use it as a financial tool. Sometime I even use it to short itself on bitmex and make money on the drops. Sorry you can’t keep up, good luck out there!

I can move wealth from my country to others for investment opportunities without the delays and fees of banks and other disreputable middlemen. I can liquidate my gold and send it to my pocket in mere minutes or convert my wealth to gold in the same fashion. I lend bitcoin to speculators for interest. I also use the Ethereum blockchain for creating CDPs and loaning myself investment money as well as use bitcoin and Ethereum and other crypto to govern and settle my investment dao. Plus other stuff that is more private. It’s not just for speculators anymore guys, it’s a new class of financial tool and it doesn’t care if you call it a ponzi or pyramid because bitcoin is the worlds first, largest, and most secure public ledger. Nuff said.

Not a pyramid either. There is an underlying network and infrastructure. Ponzis sell air and pyramids require new users to sustain and always collapse within about 5 gens or so. Bitcoin is a financial tool, I buy and sell it more  than once so I can move wealth quickly for investments. Also, this argument has been debunked for almost a decade now. Glad to have you on board, but do your history homework before you go thinking you’ve discovered something.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:00:53
Set more buys at around 7k and 6k and you might find an even better entry point. The best way to help ensure you eventually profit is to keep enough funds on hand to buy any dips that come after the dip you bought. That way you can average your entry price down over time. Glad to have you on board and, fwiw, you may have successfully “bought the dip” ....depending on how low it goes, of course. Whatever you do, don’t sell for a huge loss. Either be prepared to hold long term (1 year plus) or set a tight stop loss in case we let down again. I’ve personally bought at 5.5k, 6.7k, 8.2k, and 10k this year and remain confident in my long term prospects. Best of luck!

People still trade BitConnect on OTC markets. Beanie babies still sell on eBay. Nothing ever truly goes to zero  after it’s been imbued with value. Even when things have been forgotten almost entirely, they will be rediscovered and enjoy new waves of worth and popularity. The only questions for bitcoin are 1) how high will the next peak will be? And 2) how low will the next dip go?
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:20:57
Once again, a pyramid REQUIRES new users to remain sustainable and always collapse. Bitcoin does NOT require new users to remain sustainable. I use it over and over again as do others. Please educate yourself on what the terms you are using actually mean.

No it doesn’t, it may require new money to keep increasing in value, but as I keep saying, those of us that don’t simply use it to speculate on price use it to store and move value and we will keep the network alive regardless of price. Pay attention and stop making assumptions.

With the increases in transaction fees and all the spam attacks from BU camp, I've been wondering the same thing. I don't use paper wallets often but I had a shower thought the other day about whether or not paper wallet sweeps would be confirmed without transaction fees being paid in the current climate. I'm going to google it and see what I can find.

I have a "savings" wallet that I never touch no matter what the price does and i constantly contribute small amounts to it throughout the months. I also keep a few coins on an exchange to try and take advantage of big swings. I will be watching live Thursday - Friday when they will announce plus I have alerts set up. When they announce that it won't be approved I will immediately execute a sufficiently  low priced sell order to ensure I catch the buy on the way down and ride it out. If I'm lucky I will buy the first dip and sell somewhere near the top of the dead cat bounce and then give it a few days to let the news settle in and see what shakes out. It will either plummet after a few days or weeks OR, if people buy into the crash, it will show resilience which may cause a rally despite the bad news re: ETF. Or something else entirely could happen.
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:44:48
This sums up my feelings in the debate pretty well.
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:22:27
Yup, pretty much my own conclusion. Block size needs to grow slowly. Decentralization depends on full nodes as well as miners. Plus, off-chain transactions can incentivize their own services with cheaper fees and still contribute to the larger blockchain by attracting more users who will inevitably require the main blockchain services to transfer between services.
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:07:29
The miners have no interest in attacking the network that pays them. The only "miners" that are spamming are the BU camps and some of those were just started by Ver and his cronies. Once again, the only group that stands to get what they want is the BIg Blockers. If you think half of the miners got together just to spam (and possibly devalue) their own network then you don't understand mining. They only make money by selling the bitcoin they mine and gain from transaction fees. It would make no sense for them to give away any of that money just to make the network, which they rely on to make money, look crappy. The word logical doesn't apply to this theory.

@_date: 2017-02-24 22:22:07
Don't dump your whole wad in now. If you have severe FOMO buy a little now and then wait till the ETF buzz dies down and start buying in slowly over time. I would limit your investments in Bitcoin to 15% or less of your total savings as it is still high risk and unpredictable. Good luck!

@_date: 2017-02-28 09:03:24
Of course you think I'm wrong, your post calls for a hardfork. The difference between our two opinions on this matter is that yours is based solely on belief whereas my position is rooted in evidence. You see, despite the fact that you think something is wrong with Bitcoin, it continues to gain value, market share, users and businesses built around it. 
There is no boogie man, bitcoin is doing just what it's supposed to do. The mistake so many newcomers make is thinking that there can only be one worthwhile blockchain but the reality is that the first altcoin came days after Bitcoin was released when someone forked their own coin from Satoshi's blockchain. Ripple came soon after and still trades with value to this day. Let Bitcoin be Bitcoin and store larger sums in it and let it be a slightly more liquid form of gold. If you want a blockchain that behaves differently then embrace the full spectrum of altcoins and tokens and stop fearing that they will eat bitcoins lunch. 
I know I haven't changed your mind, but time will. Those who have ridden the cycles and seen hundreds of blockchains created, with some left to starve and others nurtured to maturity, aren't worried about a thing. Embrace the full spectrum of blockchains, my friend, and forget about how big the blocks are.

There's no need for a hardfork at this time so why risk it at all? There are plenty of other ways to help speed things along by using side chains and even other blockchain altogether. I like to use Dash, Zcash or Ethereum for faster/cheaper transactions when Bitcoin network is busy. Or, if I really need to use BTC the whole way, I just pay a high enough fee to get in on the next block. There's a small group of people doing an excellent job of convincing everyone that the blockchain is in danger and that this hardfork is the only solution but it's not. Plus, it could start hurting decentralization by deterring people from running full nodes because of data transfer and storage requirements. Don't get hung up on block size, my friend. It's not the disaster they are making it out to be and if they would stop spamming the network it wouldn't be problem at all.

Thanks for the reply, glad you enjoy bittrex. As far as keeping crypto on the exchange goes, I'm afraid I'm reaching the limit of wallets that I can successfully keep track of. I've got most of my alt holdings on a jaxx wallet that I have backed up. Unfortunately, some of the coins haven't been integrated into the multi-coin wallets which leaves me with several "core" wallets running on my PCs. I'm getting a little burned out from setting up my own wallets so I may leave this altcoin on bittrex unless that's high risk. Any suggestion for the most compatible multi-coin wallet? Maybe that needs to be a separate post. Thanks again for the input.

Stick with Gemini. I use them a lot and have never had issues, worth the hassle of getting registered. Once you get more comfortable with how Bitcoin works you can think about localbitcoins and escrow trades. There are many scammers there and you have to know how to keep yourself safe, like not using PayPal "friends and family" transfers or not using VenMo to send money.

Anytime someone asks me if they should buy: 
A.)- only invest money you can absolutely afford to lose without even getting a little mad. 
B.)- consider it a long term investment if you consider it an investment at all.
C.)- don't be afraid to spend it and use it. Keep a hardware wallet for your investment/savings and keep a wallet on your phone for purchases and experimentation. Hell, go place a bet or tip a stripper online, have some fun with it.

As someone who runs a couple of full nodes, I'm intrigued by the opportunity to have a more impactive position on the blockchain and I could see how it would allow more of the user base to have a say in Bitcoins future. I'm also extremely wary of how much collusion there is between the miners and would love to see some checks and balances to their power since they could easily hijack the system (and may have already) for their own purposes with nothing more than a handshake over lunch. 
The problem is, I just don't understand what prevents someone with deeper pockets than mine from making my (and any other individual actor's) voting power irrelevant. Also, I'm not savvy enough regarding the proposed implementation to understand if it's possible to cause hard-forks, but even soft-forks could dramatically alter the behavior of the blockchain, right? Any help understanding this is much appreciated.

Blocks come about every 10 minutes so 25 blocks is a long time to wait. Plus, if fees go up during that time it could take even longer. I'm not sure what amounts you are working with or how urgent the situation is but you may want to up your fee quite a bit.

They have modified the strategy invented by BofA which had all the largest transactions process first (out of chronological order, that is) so as to increase the likely hood of an overdraft after which all the smaller transactions would process (which there are typically more of) and they would all individually accrue overdraft fees. Genius, but the community shouldn't stand for it.

Because no one else in the game has the resources and motivation. Ver and his cronies want to seize control of "Bitcoin" but that's tricky because it's decentralized. So what they've done is hype up a problem and claim that it can only be solved by forking to the software that he controls through his team of developers. Since there actually isn't enough of a problem to warrant this proposed fork they are trying to make it look more urgent by spamming the network and posting bizarre stories on Bitcoin.com in the hopes of fooling noobs to join them under the pretense of "saving" Bitcoin. And as you can see, Bitcoin is doing just fine. I used to not care about this discussion until I started seeing the slanted news BU peddles and the spam transaction attacks (which no one else stands to benefit from) and realized that they can't be the good guys because their tactics are dishonest.

Yes. That's why I started my question with the word "if" which is commonly used in hypothetical questions to indicate a difference between reality and a proposed change to reality. And, to hedge against another poorly thought out response, I should add that I am referring to the proposed UASF which would allow nodes to choose whether or not to participate in the soft-fork, essentially giving them a "vote" on how to proceed. It has been the topic of so much conversation recently that I didn't think I needed to include that in the headline, my mistake.

If they hardfork you will, by default, have coins on both chains if you owned bitcoin before the fork. There will be no way to prevent a severe price adjustment as users and miners choose which blockchain to back/invest in. People may quickly attempt to cash in both coins causing both chains to tumble in price. Look at Ethereum fork for an idea of one way it could go down. I think if BU hardforks without 80% of the network behind it then it is destined to become an Altcoin. We shall see.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:07:31

I was going to ask why you cared so much about giving out your ID but then I checked your post history and figured it out for myself. Unfortunately for you, there is most likely going to be a markup and more risk involved in any transactions you wish to make without ID. You can try the cash deposit on LocalBitcoins.com but people are constantly hacking or buying profiles with good reviews and reputation and then keeping the money which may or may not be easily reversible depending on which method you use. The most helpful advice that I could give you would be: never send money by western union, venmo, PayPal friends and family transfers or any other method that doesn't provide for reversal of funds should they decide not to release the coins from escrow or otherwise welch on the agreement. Good luck!

So sad you guys can't tell you're being set up. All the people that would fork when Jihan's trap is revealed aren't going to go along in the first place, we're too informed to fall for this gambit.

I ordered one and it's awesome! I think it came from somewhere in the UK (I'm USA) and it took a couple of weeks but I got it. It sounds like your transaction fee was set too low and your transaction didn't go through quick enough. Most BTC pay systems time out after a certain amount of time because of inherent price volatility in Bitcoin market.

Lol! They don't have to! Holy shit man, have you even read one? First of all they all hold you to arbitration, so good luck getting to court in the first place. After that, they basically tell you that Bitcoin isn't under their control and they can't secure your investment IN ANY WAY. Read one before you go spouting off this bullshit. Oh wait, someone that believes BU is the answer probably isn't capable of reading a TOS because of all the all the big scary words that actually mean something when you string them together. Get this bullshit out of here and stop trying to scare people. You oughta be ashamed of yourself!

I'm not much for conspiracy theories but we do have a pretty openly waged war going on in the Bitcoin community. I'm just outlining what I personally believe are the motivations for the actions of some of the players. I kept wondering what the angle was with these guys besides simple greed. If you really want to help a community then you keep your criticisms behind closed doors. If you're extra classy then even after those criticisms go unanswered you don't run to sink the ship or blow he whole project up because you don't get your way. You just move on. Then I realized that what might have started as a simple ideological dispute may have offered some of the key players an opportunity to attempt a coup and that, if they played their cards right, wouldn't even matter if it succeeded because they could profit either way. Without the promise of profit I just can't see why these guys care so much. And if they really cared about Bitcoin then they are not acting in good faith to help but are instead kicking a system when it's down while screaming that they're trying to help. If it's not a conspiracy the it's the dumbest thing thing I've ever witnessed in the world of Bitcoin.

I'm not sure it's ALL luck. I've been around Bitcoin since it was an embryo, had to buy my first ones off of a guy in Second Life for LindenLab dollars because there weren't proper exchanges like there are now. It was difficult to work with back then and took ages to convert back and forth from fiat. Because it was a little slower to use than credit cards or fiat, I've always considered it more like digital gold than digital cash. This means I use it as a long term value store and I trade a little on the markets, but those typically settle off chain so no transaction fees. Other than that, I use it to settle some internal business matters (off chain) and to send wealth when it makes sense to. But the main reason I'm not frustrated with the network in its current state is because, from my perspective, it's amazing how quickly it's grown and how much the whole experience has improved since it's inception. 
Would you mind if I asked what kind of transactions are causing you so much trouble? Do you have a business that is reliant on accepting Bitcoin or do you for some reason need to make transfers often? I realize that my experience with bitcoin is not representative of everyone's and I don't mean to imply that there aren't more ways to view it. Just don't buy into all the doom and gloom everyone's selling right now, Bitcoin isn't in peril. It's designed to self govern and so far it's been doing a bang up job of growing and staying relevant, it's just another growing pain we're going through.
I would also keep in mind that someone out there is spamming the blockchain to make things seem worse than they are, and it doesn't make sense for the core team to do that. Don't waste your time fighting for people that use deceitful tactics, they are never the good guys.

I've watched every pump and dump (with skin in the game) since the creation of the first legit markets and exchanges. All I can say is that this feels different. I think people miss the chaos and profits from the early days and so they continue to disrupt and destabilize in order to both profit from alt coins and BTC itself. Oversimplifying this to another pump and dump ignores the actions of many players in this game. This game is different and it will create a new breed of bag holder.

@_date: 2017-03-07 19:13:05
Thank you for a more in-depth response, but I'm afraid it has raised a few more questions. It is my understanding from reading a few of the uasf proposals out there that it would boil down to people choosing whether or not to run nodes that processed segwit transactions and that if enough users chose to run pro segwit nodes then the miners would have to follow suit to stay relevant, how does an individuals "economic weight" figure into this other than by determining how many nodes they could dedicate to their preferred methodology? Also, what determines the "economic weight" of an individual? Is that just determined by the amount of bitcoin they hold? Isn't this saying the same thing as I did but with different words? If it's the total wealth or BTC possession of the person that counts as the amount of "voting" power then whether it's by number of nodes they can afford to run or amount of bitcoin they can buy and hold then isn't the result the same? That a small group of wealthy actors could take control?
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:57:45

It appears you are cautioning against using a uasf instead explaining how it is intended to be implemented in a way that would activate segwit AND protect against  activations of unwanted soft-forks in the future. I am less concerned with the politics of this possibility than with the technical nuances it raises. Hopefully, someone with more knowledge of how the various proposals wish to handle these issues will chime in and explain how the uasf is intended to work while protecting against bad actors seizing control with a multitude of nodes that only serve their interests.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:59:49
I would argue that this feels nothing like that. In the old days the money would flood in and there would be a predictable crash. Another article would run or another company would announce the use of Bitcoin and price would shoot up and then, at some never before achieved peak, it would crash. Over and over. When bad news came out, crash. When good news came out, moon. Nowadays, even china can't cause more than 6% fluctuation with a ban announcement. Now the market seems to hover around 1200 regardless of the news either way. The market is behaving differently and I think some people miss the good old days because they were getting rich off those swings and so they're trying to bring back the chaos they need to profit.

They did a study on trolling recently. They found out that they're all betas in real life, so they act out their alpha fantasies online where real alphas can't knock them on their asses, as they are often inclined to do irl.

Try local bitcoins.com, as long as you know what you're doing regarding Bitcoin then it's pretty safe. Don't do any western union transfers, no venmo, and no "paypal friends and family" transfers either, as all of these options are non-reversible. If you meet in person then bring someone with you and try to meet at a police station as many have set up safe areas for strangers to meet and exchange goods. Good luck.

If your coin is in a core wallet, paper wallet, hardware wallet, or even on some exchanges, then you will be fine. And, depending on how things shake out, you may end up owning both your original Bitcoin and a shiny new altcoin known as BTU (orBTCU) equal to the number of original Bitcoins that you have private keys to. Basically, you will be able to spend your coins twice on the two different blockchains if you choose to.

Oh man, a few days ago? Since when? I'll assume it's been a couple of years. Basically, there was some in fighting amongst core team that escalated (in my opinion) due to outside forces. Soon there arose a faction which is consistent in opposing the core team but continually changing shape. Now we find ourselves with most of the "core" developers still working on Bitcoin like always but there is a new group calling themselves BitcoinUnlimited who have become convinced that without on-chain unlimited block size scaling that Bitcoin is doomed. It seemed silly to me at first and I stayed out of it but soon it bubbled up so much I found myself engaging with die hard Bitcoin Unlimited supporters who didn't seem to have a clue how Bitcoin worked and didn't even have any skin in the game. The BU camp appears to mostly be made up of people who wish to use Bitcoin as a currency for buying coffee and darknet drugs and have no interest in using it as a value store. Most of them don't even have two bitcoins to rub together but are making a huge din about fees and micro transactions that aren't making the next block. Meanwhile, they block Segwit activation to make it look like the only solution is to adopt their alternative version of Bitcoin. Coinbase has already come out and said that they will list Bitcoin Unlimited as an alt coin (BTCU not BTC) so the matter is pretty much settled but these guys just keep trying to tear it all down while insisting only they can save it. Like I said, if it's not a conspiracy then it's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in the world of Bitcoin. I'm holding mine because I don't believe these turkeys stand a chance in hell of messing with Bitcoin in the long run, this is just a blip. I keep telling them to shut up and fork already because with a contentious hardfork I'll get coins in each blockchain. I'll hold the real BTC and sell off the BTCU before people realize what happened.

As long as people are involved, there will be a tendency to centralize. Something in our DNA craves strong central leadership. It's why dictatorships, monarchy's, and democratic governments that only elect from a small caste of people, are everywhere on this planet. I agree that ungoverned Bitcoin is a great idea but, then again, so is world peace. Control of Bitcoin is already centralized- small groups control the majority of hashing power, small groups control the code and engineering, small groups even control its image.

If you aren’t a day trader then stick to buying small amounts. I teach people in my group to take whatever capital they have to invest and never invest more than 1/5 to 1/3 of your cash holdings. That way, every time there is a dip you can use 1/5 to 1/3 of the cash you have left to buy dips. You never run out of money for averaging your cost down or just buying the dips. The same works in reverse for taking profits. One never truly knows where the biggest peak is until it’s behind you, but by buying the big and little dips some and selling the big and little peaks some, you will end up with more cash/gold/btc/stocks over the long run.

We spent a ton of money on building an ML Tensorflow based market predictor. It was able to run about ten minutes ahead of market and make remarkably accurate predictions about where price would go in ten minutes in the future ( longer and less accurate with other configurations, but ten minutes was about the longest for accuracy). At first we tried a little money and it seemed to work great. But as soon as we started using amounts that were more significant, the accuracy began to drop.  It seems that once you start putting enough money to matter in the system you are observing and predicting, you begin to change the outcome. I would imagine the same to be true of any system of prediction. If everyone shadow traded the best traders, we would ruin their strategy, which relies on a system where everyone DOESN’T follow their trades. Just my two bits, fwiw.

Happy to help, if it did. Also, I’m looking to Ddex, seems like they have an app. Not sure what that means really. I have a friend who’s a dev, I’ll ask him what he thinks.

I discovered Bitcoin through some security and IT friends and immediately thought about how fun it would be to use it for Poker. Then someone opened a bitcoin poker site and I loved it. Then the price of bitcoin went from $2 to $20 over night and the guy exit scammed with dozens of my bitcoin and many others bitcoin as well.

Never spend all your all money, always keep some in reserves for dips. It doesn’t have to be much, when price is lower your dollar goes further. If you keep buying in over time, you’ll be fine in the long term and most likely the midterm. 50/50 on the short term, way things look now.

Bitcoin is real. I have no idea if it or anything like it will fully replace cash or the banking system in my lifetime, but it is a real financial tool. I use it to move value between markets (not just crypto markets) and so do others. An awesome thing about bitcoin is that anyone can own a piece of a coin and enjoy the increase in value. Another awesome thing about bitcoin is that it has a limited supply which means that it’s value will probably continue to rise over fiat given a long enough time frame (for as long as it’s used, at least).
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:22:21
It’s called a limit order. You do your homework (TA) and then pick some fib lines and place sells all the way up. I had sells as high as 80k before the peak happened. I think I actually sold some on one exchange for well over 20k thanks to a spike. The only way to catch anything near the peak is to either watch it happen live and sell some or set your limit orders and catch a piece.
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:42:03
Sorry bruh, you got it wrong. Whole point of making the attack along a financial vector was to avoid the need for violence. Satoshi wasn’t stupid, the allure of control and wealth is interwoven into the very essence of Bitcoin. It’s infectious, it will continue to go viral.  By quietly usurping financial potency while the news focuses on volatility, nobody has to die. 
Also, fried tofu rocks and being gay will always be the cool thing to do bc the market is already saturated with heterosexual. Can’t be cool by going mainstream����. The only thing you may have right is the timeline. Will def take more than 30 years for all the old farts that keep trying to vote the world back into the dark ages to die. Long live Bitcoin, baby!

That’s the tricky thing about bitcoin and parabolic growth. It’s a new entity. A new network and financial tool and way of thinking. If you look at fib lines, could hit 6 figures this bull run or next. Taking into account market cap, network growth, awareness, and parabolic volatility... I’m betting within 12 years. And I wish I could be more specific, bc if I knew for sure I’d mortgage my house and sell all my toys for it.��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-02 18:26:24
Forget about short term price volatility. If you’re not the day trading type then just keep buying over time, if you make steady purchases over time then your dollar will buy more when the price is lower and you’ll always be increasing both your holdings *and* value over the long term. Then you can ignore price until it hits your number. I’m not selling any more BTC until it hits 6 figures USD and I’m taking my profits from all my other investments and dividends and putting it in Bitcoin until then. Cheers!

So your idea, to fix a problem that no one should even have, is to reinvent how everyone formats their decimals? It seems like it would be easier for the the few people who don't seem to understand the decimal system to either get used to it or use a wallet that can help them. Most wallets have settings that allow you to change the display from Satoshis to mBTC to standard BTC format. I'm really not sure how adding colons after the decimal is less confusing. Doesn't pretty much everyone already understand how the decimal system works? Is it really that hard to spot how many places down you are? Also, posting on Reddit and simply hoping the whole Bitcoin community will adopt it for no reason is probably not your best bet. You may want to release your own wallet or payment system that implements this feature if you truly believe there is a market for it.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:16:23
I see. Unfortunately I find this even more confusing. I think it will be difficult to get people to use a format unlike any other currency. I always know about how much Bitcoin is worth and moving the decimal around for conversion works easily enough for me as does the conventional BTC notation. But good luck all the same, I'm sure if people think it is useful then it will become the standard in no time at all. Cheers!

Most houses are liabilities for families that they count as an asset. You can never truly “lose access” to real estate investing. You just start small and work your way up like with anything else. I would rather have an income property and a small house than one big house that doesn’t pay me shit and costs me every month in mortgage, taxes, repairs and maintenance. If what you’re holding isn’t earning or appreciating in value quick enough to offset your value invested then its a liability that drains you, not something that adds value.

I am able to make better guesses at where the market will go bc I spend all day studying trends, sentiment, volume, developer Slacks, and the news.

I see you noobs come running up with your tiny stash of satoshis every goddamn day screaming "hodl!!!" And hoping to become billionaires just by sitting there holding someone else's invention.

@_date: 2017-07-26 01:31:17
Try again, genius. I never said 1000 pennies, you did. I said x% of a penny is less than x% of a dollar. And it is. Eth was worth much less than BTC is now during that split. You would have lost pennies per Eth. You will lose hundreds per Bitcoin. You will only get 1 shitcoin per real Bitcoin. If you want any amount worth having you will need hundreds of bitcoins. Which will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. It will lose much value. Much more than the pennies per Eth you would have lost during that fork. But since you're so smart, I'll just let you go ahead and make all those tens of dollars as your Bitcoin price plummets hundreds.

It's possible this is a recovery, but that makes no sense to me as we haven't passed any of the dangers yet. I think this is just a slight bounce but that another leg down is still incoming. I'll hold cash and try to buy lower.

I would recommend trezor as well. Paper wallets are also better than third parties or exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:47:23
That's all well and good, but in order to get enough shitcoins to make this whole venture worth it then you are going to need 400 BTC, not 4. Now leave the Eth side the same and recompute the BTC side at 400 BTC and see if you still like those numbers. Not worth the risk for me. And if you've got that kind of dough to spend I can show you waaaay better returns elsewhere.

No one controls the mining difficulty, it’s part of the code of bitcoin works. Another way to look at it would be that every miner controls the difficulty by choosing to run the code or not. And bitcoin is *deflationary* not inflationary, so I’m assuming you are concerned the mining difficulty will be become “too” difficult. This has happened, it takes time to readjust. Your money is safe, if it falls out of mempool then it will still be in your wallet.

First of all, it looks like you agree with me as I am calling for a dip in the next few days and so are you. Second of all, comparing Bitcoin with Eth makes no sense as Bitcoin costs way more. This little bump you see is a trap. It will drop at some point, may as well sell this rise and buy then.

Try keeping two stashes. Put most in a cold )paper or hardware wallet (I use trezor)) and then keep a little on the exchange to “day trade.” This way, if you are scared price will tank, you can sell the small amount on the exchange and then use that cash to buy back lower. Then you can send the extra bitcoin you bought back on the dip to your cold wallet and wait to do it again. Another great strategy is just to time average your buys and forget about the price for a set number of years. If you’re in college, you can let this money sit for 10 years or more and will most likely be quite happy. If you just want to hodl, forget the price and just focus on saving as much you can in crypto.

Depends on what you consider “owning” for some people. For instance, on the Robinhood you’re just trading paper Bitcoin (they have a custodial account that supposedly holds the bitcoin for them but all you have on Robin Hood is a “marker” and not the actual Bitcoin. They won’t let you have it. Some people only consider you as owning it if you hold your own private keys. I’ve been in since late 2010, so I’ve still got some in cold storage and I use some for altcoins day trading. Most of my cold storage is now on a few Trezors, which I highly recommend for Bitcoin and Ethereum and Zcash holders. Good luck out there, and don’t trust anyone else to hold your private keys if you actually want to own your own coins.
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:18:34
This point has surfaced over and over again since the first time bitcoin had a bull run almost a decade ago. Just consider the new confusion it would add when people see Bitcoin for $7.85 but don’t receive a whole one when they buy it at that price. It’s just decimals and no one has to buy a whole bitcoin to experience the value and gains. Cheers!
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:40:55
Looks good. I keep a large stash of crypto for long term  holding and a smaller stash for day trading, so I am definitely an “aggressive” bull. I keep my stop losses tight and my rebuys right under those. I also use trailing buys to ensure re-entry on the uptick. Good luck, traders!

Bitcoin is the largest, most secure, and most decentralized public ledger. Anyone can start one, but security will always come first where money is concerned and it’s hard to fathom how another chain could steal that spot at this point. Also, when you talk of private companies starting blockchain, you have to remember that they won’t be decentralized since they are run by a company. This means they aren’t even in the same category as bitcoin. People may buy them and use them, but they offer no advantage over bitcoin.

Bitcoin has been good to me. I’ve paid off my debt, bought the wife a luxury car, bought myself some toys, put away enough dough for the kids future education and ambitions, bought income property, bought dividend stocks, started passion projects, and tried to help as many as will listen to do the same. I also like to buy more Bitcoin on the dips as well as other crypto. I’m focused on privacy coins these days (mostly the new MimbleWimble stuff). 
Set goals and targets, never go all in or all out at one time, take profits at peaks, buy dips, and save money to buy more dips (sometimes the dips last years), capital management is key. Good luck guys!
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:05:31
You never have to go all in or cash all out at once when investing. If you believe the markets will go up from here without going down, then spend 1/5 of your holdings on bitcoin now and wait and see. If it dips, spend 1/5 of what you have left in cash ( not another 1/5 of the original amount) to buy lower. If it goes up more and you think it will go up again, spend 1/5 of what is left again. Keep doing this and you will cost average a decent entry without risking everything on one price. Wealth management is key to successful investing.

You couldn’t know for sure if that came from an address they control.

I’m in US and I use Coinbase and Gemini. They seem to have the fastest bank transfers for my part of the country and option of banks. And by trading on both I am good to go if one or the other goes down for maintenance or ddos. And I’m at least 50% hedged against any major hack or collapse of one or the other.

Bitcoin can absolutely be tracked. It is only semi-anonymous. Like a Swiss bank account, you can deal with only a string of random characters. But all transactions from and to that string can be watched. There are ways to make it more anonymous but with enough resources you can easily be discovered. If you want to use it like I do, as savings that only I control and that I can move anywhere in the world, then just buy it anywhere and then move it to a series of your own private keys. I keep min on trezor hardware wallets. If you want privacy, look into zcash, monero, or the new mimblewimble coins like Beam, BitGrin and Grin. Cheers!

Coinbase wallets currently do not support a wallet import feature. If you have paper wallets they can be imported into another wallet (Bitcoin QT, Electrum, Multibit, Armory, Blockchain.info, etc) before being sent to your Coinbase wallet. The steps to do this will vary depending on the wallet you are using.

Unless it’s an amount you can’t afford to lose, try blockchain.info. I think they also have an app now, but not sure. I used them to send my paper wallets to my hardware wallets a while back.
Edit- *.com to .info

Unless you are transacting 6 figures and above and as long as the bitcoins you save came from reputable exchanges (Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, etc) then it won’t set off red flags. They will simply report the profits to the irs as capital gains if it amounts to enough to trigger a report.

Get a trezor. It will also store LTC, ZCash, Dash, Eth, Eth tokens, and a gang of others. Never trust exchanges except when you must in order to trade. Trust them less when the price is going up. Keep those private keys in your own hands and back up your seed phrases. Steel or acid free paper and ink (no need to laminate, just keep in a safe place).

Sounds like you got a scam or at least shit wallet app if it won’t let you adjust fees. Try samourai

I started out with only 1% of investment portfolio in Bitcoin. It now represents 50% of my portfolio because it grows so much faster than anything else. And I do attempt to rebalance at opportune times, but it just keeps coming back up.

Bitcoin is the worlds largest, most secure and most decentralized public ledger. It is a brand new class of financial instrument that is just beginning to be used. Value like you would a network more than a currency, imho. And the halvenings will be consistent at around 4 years unless fundamental changes are made to the bitcoin core protocols which, for this matter, are very unlikely to happen in the current state of the ecosystem or any near future that anyone could see.

Get yourself a trezor or ledger or at least use electrum over that garbage. It’s run by people who constantly try to sabotage Bitcoin and trick other people into using the coin they got tricked into using.
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:19:05
Holy shit! My bad, you’re right!!!!
Edit- I fixed it

Relax and hold on to your satoshis. Pull back is healthy and attracts more buys and sets off new rounds of fomo. Just set some auto buys for the next 6 months at least and then be happy in a year/year and a half or so. And don’t cash it all out and save some of your cash to buy the next crash (60-90% discount) and buy your coins back cheaper for the next run. Cheers!

Invest in a hardware wallet (I use Trezor) and keep it there and keep your seed words safe.

This already happened. It was that large dump that happened recently. It failed to kill Bitcoin. It will always fail. Faketoshi is an asshat, he has no power beyond speaking fees. He sold all his bitcoin and only holds worthless BTCSV now, lol

Sweep to a new wallet on blockchain.info and if selling simply move to exchange and sell or if keeping then store on a hard meats wallet. Or just leave them on the paper wallet. Or split it up and send some to exchange to sell and keep some on a new paper wallet or hardware wallet.

Wow,  I cant believe there’s anyone left that would throw their own credibility away supporting this obvious fraud. ��‍♂️

There was a time when you could mine them from a laptop. Barely cost any electricity, just free bitcoins. But that was even before me. By the time I got there it was already GPU miners and then pools, now asic pools.

Joan Gald appears to be a play on the name John Galt from the book Atlas Shrugged. Could be a veiled threat to either appreciate their service or face them packing up and taking all their fancy tech away from us.��‍♂️

I agree with this. I could care less about etfs. Traders already know how to access bitcoin and crypto markets (they’re based on forex markets ffs) and institutional investors and funds are accessing through custody accounts being started by all the major exchanges and markets.  This kind of news didn’t play into price as much as people suspected last bull run and I think it will have even less impact now and in the future. Just my 2 bits.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:15:19
Lol, this is bullshit. That fake satosishi has been caught lying too many times to have any credibility left. Don’t throw yours away after his.
