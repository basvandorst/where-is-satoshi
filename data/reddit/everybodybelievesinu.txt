So get rich quick speculation is a 2 month trade with an overzealous roi expectation? Why is this bad? Its great for traders (who are also speculators) who know how to take short term profits. What your describing are just traders whom don't know how to trade. By your definition the quick buck speculators are your day traders; the ones you define as being an important part of the economy, whom I garuntee will never be weeded out. The traders are the ones crashing the price by pushing us into a margin long squeeze causing calls to be covered, they do this by shorting pushing us into this downtrend. In other words what your asking for is not possible, think about it. This is how trading and markets work. What your asking for doesn't make sense.

It was a fake wall. You can actually make an invisible wall on Finex if you are serious about selling. The point to flash a large ask wall like that is to let other people see it because you want to keep prices down for buying or just to keep the momentum for shorting which is more likely.

They did state that this was an interpretation of how the current tax law effects BTC. Which is what everyone in the US was thinking it was anyway now its just confirmed. This does not mean it cant be changed to a use basis or isn't being talked about currently in the IRS. Here's to blind wishful thinking that wont likely come true.
