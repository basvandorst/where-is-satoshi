One question, would it have any value to start at lightning node now early to reserve a better "Place" in the onion network? Essentially having many good connections in the inner ring down the line?

You have to consider inflation of fiat currencies too, i predict a major uptick in inflation ratios across the board for fiat. Suddenly one Bitcoin could rise to millions of Dollars through the years.

Bluewallet is a custodial lightning service. They have channels open to send and receive.
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:22:29
Some kind of 3rd party to check your adresses? Think about it miners do the same thing on the original chain. You trust third parties to monitor and secure the network/blockchain your funds are on all the time.

@_date: 2019-03-08 16:48:42
Withdraw to onchain not possible afaik but you could send to your own lightning node or another Service that is able to exchange to onchain bitcoin.

Loop in doesn't really open channels no? Just changes the balance on existing ones.

There is no limit to the blocks that can be mined, only to the blocks that generate new Bitcoins. After that the only reward for miners will be transactionfees.

Currencies don't 1000x in 10 years in purchasing power.. Bitcoin is more of a speculative store of value asset at this point. Also currencies commonly have a type of official governmental issued property to it. It's actually kinda hard to put Bitcoin in a traditional category.
@_date: 2019-08-04 01:38:39
One thing to note is, you don't actually need all those miners and hashpower to validate and execute the transactions. You need them to secure the network, that's a difference.. you could actually mine all the transactions of Bitcoin on a single old Laptop but the network wouldn't really be secure
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:26:23

Why scan just type it in?
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:30:34
Mining can't get too expensive as difficulty can adjust.
Transactionsstorage has nothing to do with the amount of Bitcoins that are in existance. Currently "mining Bitcoins" means finding a new block with transactions in it and getting a reward for it, this generates new Bitcoins. If all rewards are handed out at 21 million Bitcoins you can still find new blocks with transactions in it, but your only reward would be the transactionfees not new Bitcoins.

Bitcoin of course! If you want to send Bitcoin you have to include a fee for the miners to incentivise them to include your transaction into the next block. If it gets included the miner that found the block gets your fee. Btw this happens already.

Google metcalfe's law. Sure you could create 100 of other cryptocurrencies but why would anyone use them? Bitcoin has demonstrated 10 years of resilience and adoption and is not stopping. Also despite OP's argument Bitcoin has the most developers working on it and related projects. And you can divide one Bitcoin into miniscule parts (Satoshi = one hundred millionth of a single coin) so you don't need to print more, just divide them more and adjust the price.
