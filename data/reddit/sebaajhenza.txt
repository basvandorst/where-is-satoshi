You'd be better off spamming them with *almost* plausible values. That way they can't tell real from fake.

Ah that makes a lot more sense. Thank you for taking the time to explain it for me.

The concept of a private key, and needing the hardware wallet to fully sign transactions makes sense;  but what I'm confused about is the key pool for transactionss... Mentioned briefly here: 
Don't you need to regularly create backups that include the key pool?

My thoughts exactly.

Thanks for such a clear response. I'd be making something fairly cryptic to hide the 24 words at home, and then store another copy offsite in the same manner.
So long as this is not an issue:  than I'm all good.
Is the rule above only relevant for those specific wallets? I would be livid if I got burned by something like that.
To save me a little research time, say the market did something crazy, I lost my Nano, but wanted to sell immediately; what are some software wallets that would allow me to use my 24 words, recover all my funds (even after 100 transactions) and sell my coins?

Thanks for such a fast reply. So backup words are also used for other wallet types to generate their private key?
I thought because the way hardware wallets work, they store private keys differently to the standard software wallets. I think there's still a bit of confusion on my end.
Is the only difference that with software wallets the private key is stored on your PC, and therefore can be read by hackers/etc?
Following that line of thought, so long as I wrote down/stored my 24 words, and if I lost my Nano; I could download the standard Bitcoin wallet, plug-in my 24 words and still have full access to my entire wallet? Albeit, it would no longer be as secure as the hardware was, but atleast I wouldn't have lost my funds?
This still confuses me somewhat, simply because of what I've read about the standard wallet generating 100 transaction keys. I'd assume the hardware wallet works in a similar way, and if I lost it - after downloading a new software wallet and even after plugging in my 24 words, it wouldn't have knowledge of those prior transactions made with my hardware wallet... Right?
*Cue brain implosion* - Sorry if this is a bit rambly.

Whoops, a typo on my part. I'm aware it's btcmarket(s). Thanks for the warning though.

I'm not really for or against the guy. I mean if he wants to insinuate he is Satoshi, that's just dumb.
I don't really like his macho alpha-male demeanor either. But he raised a few points that were interesting. Specifically that he wants Bitcoin to be used for everything, and that requires way faster transactions. I also found it interesting that he was saying that he doesn't care if it costs $20,000 to get a mining set up, and that he things the little guys shouldn't be able to mine with a raspberry pi, and that's fine by him.
Strong opinions, I'm not for or against them personally. I take everything fairly liberally when it comes to cryptocurrency. I don't have a strong opinion eitherway.

I didn't think his talk the other week was as bad as people are making out. I mean he is obviously playing up the fact some people called him Satoshi which is lame, but he had some interesting points.

I'd happily take some of your hands if you'd like! PM me. Lol.
