As a brand new bitcoin-er (or whatever the term may be) thanks for saying this! After months of hearing about it and not really looking into it I've finally taken the time to comb through here and various other places, finding out what pool vs solo is, how to use various programs, where to go and where not to go. I'd just like to say for the most part this sub is super helpful and has really taught me a lot, I appreciate all the helpful comments on the various threads. Here's to hoping where all rich soon (me and my .00000164 are hopeful after just a day! Haha)

It's Tuesday in Ga so I suppose this is the thing? I'll add jokes just in the chance I'm ever asked did I work for my tips then I can say yes.
I tried to make a belt out of an old wrist watch I had....it was a waste of time.
You want to hear a joke about Nitric Oxide. How about NO.
You never hear jokes about cobalt, radon and yttrium, because they're too CoRnY.
Knope out.

So....uh, could you feasibly buy bitcoin in USD from/with a US bank/account at the $742 it's at on coinbase. 
Then send the bitcoin to a unocoin account, and sell bitcoin via unocoin into a Indian NRE account. 
Then transfer the rupee through an exchange back to your us bank account. 
Wash, rinse, repeat?
