increased liberty through immutability and decentralization seems like BS to me, immutability is not increased liberty, or you believe in zksnarks being production ready now, i don't understand how i can achieve personal increased liberty if things I do online will be there forever and this is not to say that when ill is done towards me and it is registered online I will be able to seek better justice than we do it today but neither of these are liberties. Liberty is having freedom of choice

Yes agree that was a little bit pushed from my side, but then again this is reddit and I'm not doing gov. job by contributing to it so I let myself loose. 
The only positive thing, I think, bitcoin has to achieve is to become an alternative currency, this is going to be the biggest experiment and total achievement. 
Now what I meant is exactly what you as well understood, here so points to further elaborate and make myself clear:
a) yes I'd prefer to transact in a currency that only I can control, provided that there are tools that are making this control easier for say technically illiterate folks
b) I still can be tracked, by associating my transaction behavior and address of my wallet (see IRS investigation into Silk Road or BitFury providing institutional tools 
c) there are offerings on the market that will make my transactions go dark
d) these cryptographic tools are far away from consumer adoption and we'll have to see how they play out
e) finally I was not referring much to the currency transactions and I have whole other view on it which frankly let's not get into. What I referred to was that immutability and decentralization as an overall blanket for all online activity and preach that this is the way to go is a  bit disturbing to me. But yes I agree the point probably made in this post comprised only currency transactions and not everything else.
(lastly) but I hate to say it there is nothing black and white, as much as I'd benefit from immutability, I'd might be embarrassed by it, if cryptography is not stellar around securing my privacy over it and there is a breach I even might be manipulated by some bullshit I did. You don't believe humans are perfect do you? Because we're flawed all and we'll fuck up one way or another.
So yes alternative currency I'M ALL FOR IT.
I'll wait for good privacy tools and then I'll think where do I need to rely on trustless products.

Sorry I'm late for the party. I stumbled upon this post - can anyone point to Dan's position or something?

&lt; this. im tweeting it
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:46:08
he got 822 recommendations on this medium post, so I mean that he's somebody with a following and who is vocal. It was my first encounter with him, I guess others have a better understanding on his positions and what he stands for.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:25:34
Okay. Apart from saying its a lie, i didnt read some real arguments to back it up. Somebody below said tho he can be implying by tweet to make bitcoin regulated as ICOs so thats something to think for for me. 
Frankly i think bitcoin is the only successful cryptocurrency up to date with most robust characteristics. But i keep my mind open to read and digest other ventures, yeah scams are here and there but taking an extreme position is a discredit to some folks who dedicate time and enthusiasm to develop other ideas too. His tweet for me was more like an ironic statement for the current state of the situation but i'll dig deeper toward a thought of implying its regulation as ICO. 
As far as core team or r/bitcoin goes i don't have a firm position on that, take it as it is. Everyone is player here with their own stakes. Some for better some for worse. In do bitcoins long tho.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:10:45
To each his own ratio. Eventually we might be both wrong. I'm considering to bet on few other currencies (doing research now).  Might invest a bit in ripple as its in dip + increase my ETH. But having bitcoin for long term in nobrainer for me
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:13:26
Hope so, if they get a little bit smart folks to discuss and understand yeah it wont get through

really depends on the investment you do have and strategies. I have my set up a little bit complicated. But because I don't deal with anything really big as amount, I rely on blockchain (as a wallet), I store everything as hard copy elsewhere. I transact whenever I need with mobi (wallet + card, you probably need to send small amounts when you need to pay anywhere). As I don't transact with eths I store them on ethereum wallet. I do shapeshift whenever I can't get better trades. I use localbitcoins, used once cex.io was okay, some use gdax (owned by coinbase). I try to stay away from keeping anything within traders. But yeah fees are starting to suck a lot too. 
better take thorough care of private keys and all and come up with your own set up. depends how you invest, whats your strategy, how you transact and what coins you use. I might be doing something wrong also and might change set up but thats something set up for now.
hope it helps
*edit: coinbase as i know has high fees, withdrawals not great, well in general its reliable pretty sure but not super convinient + like 2 days ago whole network was down due to Bancor ICO (on ethereum) that sucks - but i guess its part of the bigger problem*

same question, i guess he's pretty celeb 822 recommendations on that post. Gotta check him out better - still i guess he's another trashtalker. Having a rational mind you'd agree with him and disagree at the same time and call him a dork for being too explicit in his hatred.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:53:22
Thanks for enlightenment, will definitely and sincerely try to look from your perspective, doubting your knowledge is awesome, but if its wrong, wait me post back here and shame you master
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:22:04
Well thanks, just been digging deeper into the conflict. I guess if it does have a context behind it, that will be pity. Was listening to Ver's discussion and didn't get any arguments he backs his position with BU, apart from just being agnostic. Hate when people do not back up their opinions on such an acute topics, in addition when their pretty vocal in community
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:47:33
yeah well, that bill info was circulating for a day. I think I see the reason why they intro'd it, but I'm skeptical of its implementation - they need some legal wording I guess for "in case something happens" with it in regards of terrorism or something. I still think implementation and the idea of the bill is very dumb tho. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:00:17
I agree on some level. But my approach is also that saying it is our bubble is overstatement. To this stage how cryptocurrencies have grown was an effect of the community bonanza, excitement for something that disruptive (for gods sake its almost vomit-worthy to read about next doordashes raising millions in vc and believe my it happens daily) so isn't it wonderful that new tech gets attention. 
Let's look at what we have today as something that will break cryptocurrencies into the mainstream (it's happening, regulators here and there changing their positions, big companies more interested in exploring tech, i mean not that innovation budget corruption by CIOs but when regular board members get interested and CEOs thats a mainstream sign). 
Well I still do not think btc and eth will crash bubble style, but as we now will go full mainstream, this mainstream will bring huge correction + will bust some scam-like players. After that with what we will be left will be some solid foundation for the next sustainable stage of growth. 
Regarding your quote "cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference" is insulting also. It is about each persons vision, what they see the future be like and believe it differs. Personally I hold bitcoins 80%, ethereum 20% - and my position is that bitcoin is far ahead to stand solid after the storm passes than any other currency, but I also feel that ethereum builds ecosystem around itself, builds enterprise level hype and is well positioned to be the "go-to-blockchain" when we need more than just store of value/medium of exchange. my 2 cents here

I think you knocked her up accidentally. Now wait pregnancy sucks. Then till baby is 1 years old you won't get proper sleep, but then its all good. Jealous man.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:20:46
Can someone be more stupid, I mean why to waste time and money to write up such a dumb bill?
That was my first reaction literally - But then well okay it all comes down to AML/KYC, terrorism financing... well illegal money pouring through border.  I understand that okay. Although I guess I can pass without a hassle the border with my cryptocurrency so why bother even writing this shitty bill? But then again, okay they understand  (I hope) its bullshit in regards of regulating this issue, but they still need some legal wording in case something happens probably.
Let's take out positive from this dumb narrative: CBP acknowledges the power of bitcoin.
*sorry for me thinking loudly*
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:49:42
why? because you hate ethereum, bu, vitalik everything related to ICO? i mean this is a trend comparison on a popular language. I think  its a funny tweet. not much intended to be offensive to anybody - it just reflects current situation in cryptocurrencies. If i'm wrong and his tweet is a bitter reply to something show me, enlighten me. I'm okay to listen and change my views
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:12:25
I think its a cool idea, this way you also understand mbtc as flexible medium of exchange, aside the store of value. I think its good because last week met old friend (he's a smart guy) and he started to talk about his thoughts of investing in btc. Next thing he says he's looking at ripple because 1 ripple is under $1usd and he doesn't have enough to buy 1btc. Yeah then a lecture followed about 8 decimals but I think, we can think of this option of displaying it, will help to go mainstream
