Oh ok. Thank you.

Sounds familiar to the current situation?
Maybe what you are describing is the human condition and not really a valid argument against bitcoin replacing the dollar?

And I was dirt broke

Time will tell but I've never seen altcoins making headlines. If you have "good ideas" but nobody knows about them you don't have good ideas. You have ideas.

Have you already maxed your IRA contributions? Invest in safe conventional stuff first. Bitcoin and any other crypto is risky. Like I said in my original post unless you would be willing to spend that $150 on powerball or scratchoffs you're better off just taking it easy. Other than that all I can say is, do your homework because that's free.

Just do what I do. Instead of wasting money on lottery tickets put that money into bitcoin and forget about it. If it goes up, great! If not that money was probably forfeit anyways. If Bitcoin replaces $ it will not matter if you saved or lost $500 now and then. The people that held will be kings. If Bitcoin doesn't replace $... again the money would have been forfeit anyways. Don't be crazy and invest your life savings in this stuff only to see the price drop $10,000 the next day. Good luck! Have fun!

Short term. Long term you do have to have faith.

For starters a lot of other countries would value an alternative to $ if only to make their own domestic currencies stronger compared to the dollar.
Another reason is, technically speaking, bitcoin can be completely decentralized. It is an intrinsically international apolitical currency.
It has its own advantages as a purely  digital currency which would fill up several articles on its own.
There is more but that's plenty.

Me neither! But cryptocurrencies are basically gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:16
I quit for a reason!
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:01:17




That is still world shattering.

You should! I am coming up on my four year anniversary and I've saved probably about $9,000 since I quit drinking. If I'd invested it in bitcoin consistently over the last four years I could have paid off my student loans and bought a new car. Instead it went to eating out and various other self-treats. Still much rather have those treats than the beer! Check out r/stopdrinking if you need help!

The "cent" in percent means 100. It is usually used to indicate fractions of 100 of something with the denominator being 100. But it just means per 100 of something. You can lose 100% of your money, and it is generally understood that the convention means all of your money.  However your investment can decrease 200% and that is also, generally, understood to mean your investment is now a quarter of what it once was. Why would people say that? Numbers are generally easier to communicate and figure when they are round, like 10, 100, or 1000.

There is no shortage of clean energy on this planet. If anything generating demand for more clean energy will be a boon to economies all over the world.


If it replaces the dollar (and as it is already replacing weaker currencies) then what is available will still be regulated by supply and demand. There's difference between buying a loaf of bread with $1 and .00000008BC.


We can fork. No similar option exists for fiat.


There is a world of oppurtunity here. I said that back in 2010 but I was broke and couldn't afford the risk.

It hasn't been attached to anything *yet*.
Probably because there's really nothing else stable right now either. Oil is losing its share by the year just like all other hydrocarbons, just like gold. In ten years oil will join coal as a permanently dying industry.
Someday however something distinctly valuable may get attached to bitcoin. And then we shall see!
What about a Tesla? Or a rocket ride? Or a vote from a politician or implants or illegal genetic modification? Assassin drones? This is the 21st century. Anything can happen. We have 80 years of technogical progress and political turmoil ahead of us. Anybody that is saying "never" has no concept of the possibilities.

Altcoins may have a role to play, but they are even more speculative than bitcoin at this point aren't they?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:24
I'm not qualified to say. But there is the option to fork if things go sideways. That's not an option with fiat.

Don't underestimate hype. Plenty of terribly dumb things are wildly successful just based on hype alone.
