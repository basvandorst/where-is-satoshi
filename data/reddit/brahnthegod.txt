Won't be able to accelerate that, sorry. :(

Correct, pools do not need transactions to be submitted. However, they offer the service to do so which is how we get transactions confirmed.
You say its 100% shady, but **there is 0% risk in using our service**; we offer 1 free acceleration on sign up - no payment needed which leads me onto.. preying on desperate people, how? We aim to produce a video that will show our accelerator in action by confirming transactions that have been stuck for a long period of time.

Once I stop making the title of the post sound like I'm a foreigner. Sleep is a good thing, maybe I should get some. Good night.

Sorry, this transaction's fee was too low. We require a minimum of 15 sat/B.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:41:21
Just accelerated your transaction! Should be confirmed very soon.

I am unable to accelerate either one of those transactions as their fees are too low, we require a minimum of 15 sat/B, sorry.

There's not much to explain, but this is exactly what happens when your transaction is accelerated.

Just created a video of confirming 5 transactions from this post in under 3 hours!

The best one to go with is [MicroTX]( it's paid, but only $3 per transaction, honestly the cheapest that I've ever seen.
