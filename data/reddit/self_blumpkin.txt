Yeah. I’ve had a few years to get over it now. There’s no way I could have known. 
As for if no one sold, you’re right, I just would have preferred if “I” didn’t sell hahah. I made about 8x what the graphics cards were at the time for my farm which was nice, but goddamn lol.

No I didn’t keep my coins. I sold them in 2012 for about 7 dollars a piece if I remember correctly. I bought a car and paid off the debt I ran up buying all the GPUs I mined with. 
Don’t get me wrong, bitcoin did well by me, just at the wrong time when you consider the scale of it
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:24:09
Sigh. This is me. Except I didn’t buy them, I mined them.

Ahhh SETI. How i found bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:54:31
over two-ish years, more than that actually. I gambled a lot of it (satoshi dice was a lot of fun), i spent a lot of it at a place i won't talk about, and sold it as well. I got a nice car with the balance of what i had. 
I had quite a few computers mining it. At College where i had a lot of friends in my dorm that didn't mind me using their machines when they weren't using them (and even some times when they were using them) i was getting hundreds a day. 
Blocks were 50 BTC back then. As a CS major it was about the nerdiest thing i could do. 
It's certainly the biggest mistake I'll ever make.

Opposition in a mature fashion is not preposterous. “Fuck your shitcoin you stupid fucking idiot” just isn’t necessary. You can’t make an argument for it. Internet hate culture brings out some of the worst in humans other than the real bad shit (violence, etc). It’s real easy to talk shit to someone when you you’re just pounding out your garbage on a keyboard staring at a monitor. 
Tell me, how does it help anything? How does it work any better than using facts to shut down trolls? 
Trolls feed off that shit.

Oh boy if you don’t think there’s hate in crypto you’re living under a rock. People are calling each other stupid pieces of shit in literally every Reddit crypto thread, daily. 
I don’t even know what trope you’re talking about.

@_date: 2019-12-17 16:54:26
The hate is the problem. When the communities surrounding the most prominent projects out there are fighting each other every day from the outside we look like a bunch of children in the school yard. 
It’s just unfortunate.

@_date: 2019-12-18 15:26:28
I agree to a point. Calling them out is one thing. Name calling and feeding the trolls might be a bit overboard. 
On the same side of the coin, fools will be fools. ICOs still pull suckers in. There might be a level of mitigation that this kind of calling out helps with, in which case, it’s a net positive. 
There’s a really fine line between informing the uninformed and leaving civility behind and being a jerk. I’m not going to try and pretend that I can change that dynamic, nor do I think it’ll change. 
I’d just like to see a higher level of civility in the space so when newbies come in and check out some discussions the threads aren’t full of people going full-on r-tard on each other like a school yard lol. That’s missed opportunities to people waiting for the space to “grow up”

Oh I remember all too well hahah. The difference is with this bubble burst a whole swath of newcomers are in the space spewing opinions laced with hate everywhere. 
With all eyes on crypto now a peek into the communities (on Reddit at least) makes it look like, to an outsider, that nothing will ever come from this hard work. 
When looking at crypto as a whole this sort of rhetoric happening in every single thread actually sets back EVERY project. If I was a perspective investor and I went onto the Reddit communities to see what everyone is doing to improve the tech I’d nope the fuck out so quick from investing.

That’s not censorship. That is removing a channels rights to ad revenue due to YouTube’s relationships to their ad partners. 
If I ran a brand I would sure as shit want to make sure that my product isn’t being advertised in front of or in the middle of, for example, a video full of hate speech. 
Do I think YouTube goes too far sometimes with their rules? Yeah. 
Do I think there should be more personal scrutiny rather than algorithms and AI stripping channels / videos of their ad revenue? Sure. 
You cannot call demonetization censorship. 
Removing videos is censorship. They do that as well for reasons such as copyright, which is completely valid if you believe in copyright law whatsoever. They also remove videos that violate their community standards. I think that has to be in place too. I do think they could use more “humans” making some of those decisions and I think their customer service could be about 1000x better than it is.
I also think a decentralized solution could work but there’s a few problems with that I haven’t seen good solutions for yet. You can’t have a decentralized video server and not expect the worst of the internet to show up on there. Community voting can easily be gamed. Now you have a network where videos are stored on node machines containing HIGHLY sensitive content. 
For now, YouTube is a necessary evil.

I agree Bitcoin is what matters. It's the whole calling everything else out as a scam, thinking every single person is a shill (alert mentality, paranoia), talking intense amount of shit about everyone else, etc. that i feel could hold the space back. 
Seeing Bitcoin is all that matters we shouldn't even have to be assholes to everyone else to win. The market will prove us winners without all that and might even do it sooner if the community around bitcoin were a level-headed one. 
It's probably a pipe dream seeing this is the internet, and worse still, reddit.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:12:41
That’s a fair statement. There’s hate all over Reddit. I guess when you throw money into the mix you can’t expect it to be “better”
It’s a bummer for sure. I want the 2012 crypto community back, before all the shit slinging, hate, etc. rampant innovation fueled a lot of excitement. I feel like stagnation in the space has given breathing room to a super super toxic mindset.

It's a group of users / developers / thought leaders all working towards the common goal of disrupting the banking system. How is this not a community? 
Right now it's a pretty shitty community if you ask me but a community all the same. Each project is at the competing projects throats online and very publicly. 
We're not going to disrupt shit if we can't stop disrupting ourselves.
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:42:06
Is there some rule where everyone on reddit has to be shitty in every subreddit? 
Were trying to be taken seriously and all the communities act like this. We'll never get taken seriously if we just say "well it's reddit, people are going to be assholes". 
I think it's a lost cause to be honest. Lets just hope that the merit of crypto in general isn't judged by its userbase.
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:52:03
What?! Hahah that doesn’t even make any sense! I’ve got a few coins in my “bags” I don’t trade much. I just want crypto to usurp the banking system. I don’t really care what coin it is as long as it happens. My ear is close enough to the ground to make moves if I see the market moving towards the goal of people becoming their own banks. 
You on the other hand, well I’m not going to start assuming why you’re in crypto, but I’ll bet it’s not for very good reasons. You’re part of the problem, far far away from being part of the solution.
My bags are overwhelmingly weighted with BTC
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:06:50
Your pp smol. 
Big picture, you’re right. But if you think perceived maturity of the user base as well as those who are involved in the advancement of the codebase won’t hinder progress id say that’s pretty dumb. 
Companies fold due to scandals in leadership all the time. Bitcoin isn’t a company but it’s an investment vehicle with real people behind its progression. 
Again, will it go to zero because we’re all giant fucking assholes like you? Nah. But it won’t help and could certainly hinder. 
You can think I’m an idiot all you want. This is the Internet where opinions are like assholes. Everyone’s got one and they all fucking stink.

Here's the deal. Very efficient miners are making it into the market en-masse now thanks to Bitmains 7nm architecture. There are the miners that are running these machines with cheap power and doing well. The vast majority of machines that are out there (and still turned off) are the S9s. If the market valuation were to move high again you would see a LOT of those S9s get turned back on. The nethash would move up SIGNIFICANTLY with the market. A profitable S9 would is something that a lot of miners who turned off their machines in 2018 and 2019 are desperately hoping for. 
The machines are out there to support a 20k and even a 30k BTC if you ask me. 
I was the in-house mining expert for a collocation firm that has  temporarily, shut down their doors in late 2018 due to unprofitably of S9s and the limited number of S11s, S15s and S17s that were just coming out at the time. 
The miners will be there to make sure the difficulty rises with the value which will keep everything in parity and make sure that miners aren't making a KILLING and thus sustaining the current state of the miner/market relationship. 
We will 100% be opening our doors again for collocation contracts once the market for such a service (our electric is super cheap) dictates that we can fill our shelves again.

If someone locked up 5 grand of mine of course i wouldn't be happy. No one would. That doesn't mean that anything is going to change automatically. Posting on reddit about it without disclosing the entire story will only get people guessing as to how to help you. 
If you can't disclose why YOU think the money is locked up then you need to consult with a professional that you can confide in who will in turn help you navigate your way through this problem you're having. I wish you luck.

It’s sort of unreasonable for them to commit such an action. They’re one of the only government sanctioned exchanges around (in the US at least). They have a LOT to lose, customer-wise if they started poaching users funds. Does this preclude them from doing such a thing? Absolutely not. Does it make it far more likely they’re going to play by the rules? You bet. 
There are a lot of sticky situations that people can get themselves in where a governing body steps in and says something to the effect of “freeze so-and-do’s assets. Coinbase being the law-abiding entity they are probably would conform to these requests far more often than other exchanges that haven’t gone through the rigorous process of getting themselves in line with regulations. 
As far as OPs story, not once in this thread has he said “I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.” When asked what he did he becomes quite dodgy and keeps referring to the fact that Coinbase (in what is obviously a canned email that is sent to anyone that violated ToS) said he could withdraw his funds. I find it far more likely that they don’t have another canned message or a personally written message in the case a governing body steps in to freeze assets (such as FinCEN) and for people that do have their assets frozen they get the ToS email as well as locked out of their account with strict instructions to support to not discuss an ongoing investigation with the suspect. 
I could be completely wrong in this matter, I’ll give you that. If I am I’ll gladly eat my words. I’m just working off of what OP has provided us in this thread other than complaints against Coinbase without divulging other critical helpful information that might actually lead to solid advice from a redditor.

I "glanced" at the emails and differences. I didn't go too far into depth, nor did i comment on the situation. 
The dude brought his battle to reddit not once, not twice, not even three times. He very clearly was told to contact local law enforcement and he very clearly did not follow those instructions. He had millions on the line and instead of lawyering up and going after his millions he decided that his best course of action was complaining on reddit. 
You may be on his side with this one and you're totally allowed to have that opinion but regardless of the "translated" emails each one of those threads got cringier and cringier to the outsider like myself. I for one am happy he's not posting anymore. 
I am, however, incredibly curious as to what ended up happening with that story. I don't remember seeing a "Binance gave me my money back!" post so if i had to guess local law enforcement decided to visit him rather than waiting for him to come to them. Before you jump down my throat for that too, it's just a guess.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:22:22
If there was an investigation support would not be allowed to even tell you there was an investigation. 
It's also possible that they detected a problem and was approached by law enforcement after they told you that they would help you, which now, they might not be able to. 
If i were you I would contact someone other than Coinbase to figure out what is going on. It's clear at this point that Coinbase isn't going to help you and it's pretty clear to me at least that the reason for this is something that isn't under Coinbase's control.
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:23:00
That's as blanket a statement as saying they stole money. 
This guy's basically stated that he violated terms of service but hasn't let anyone know how he has which would help people help him come up with solutions.

Remember that guy screaming from the top of his lungs at Binance or some other exchange that locked up millions of dollars and they kept on telling him to ask local law enforcement what he did... to the point where a Binance rep had to come into one of the threads and call the guy out for doctoring emails to make himself look better? 
When people fuck up and take to reddit to try and "warn" people i get a real kick out of it. 
Sure there's valid complaints, and they're important to see, but posts like this make me giggle.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:13:10
Was the email they sent you where they said you could withdraw your funds a system-generated email? This might be a canned response they send to all people that violated their terms of service. 
If i had to guess they're under orders from a financial institution or a state authority to make sure that you're not allowed to access your funds. There's quite possibly an active investigation regarding those funds. This is why Support cannot talk to you about it. 
If support was able to help you in getting your funds back I would have to assume that they would help you do so. My guess, and this is only a guess, is that there's a good reason as to why you're not allowed to touch the funds. And support isn't going to be able to tell you why that is.

The guy admitted to violating ToS so I’m not quite sure what you’re on about, but please, do continue.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:01:14
My guess is that Coinbase is being told not to give the details regarding why they won't let you withdraw your funds. I don't like to point fingers without knowing the whole story but shit like this doesn't just "happen". There's a very clear reason as to why Coinbase cannot give you details and that reason could be explained to you quite rationally if you simply stated how you violated their Terms of Service.
