Definitely a valid choice. I'm just speaking from my own experience. I chose a year of backpacking Asia and spending money over running my business and making 6 figures that year. Best decision I ever made. All I know is, spending that money changed my life in a way saving or making money never could.

Even better, until your mom can use Bitcoin without understanding it. It's not like I know how visa handles their transactions, if I can download an app and just do everything simply without understanding what's going on behind then the real adoption can begin.

Did you just ask if anyone could predict the future...?

Based on that logic, you should never spend any money you ever have... Except for just enough to not improve your own quality of life.

Unless Trezor said which 3rd party sellers they have distributed to, there really is no way to know if yours is counterfeit unless your coins get stolen. If you mailed me your Trezor, next week I could have it live for sale on Amazon in incredibly protective and sealed packaging. My listing would only be for 1 qty, but you'd never a have a way of knowing that's the only Trezor I've ever had for sale under my 3rd party seller account.

But they could have had a factory in China make it, then seal it with their own tools. Trust me, it isn't very hard to buy the things necessary to create what looks like factory seals.

The biggest risk imo is a counterfeit from a Chinese factory with a built in backdoor. You would never know that the third party seller had done that until you send it in to Trezor like you said, and they reply back telling you they didn't make that one.

Tampering isn't the risk imo. A counterfeit from China that is designed to look exactly like ledger is the risk. And you really don't have a way to know if a 3rd party seller has done that.

As an Amazon seller, let me try to clarify. On the listing for "Trezor bitcoin wallet, Black", there are 45 sellers. Most of them probably bought from trezor directly to resell. But, the lower the number of their seller reviews, the less trustworthy they have proven themselves. 
They could easily buy 100 from trezor, then hack them, or even buy a fake version from China that also has a backdoor. Then, they send them in to Amazon, they become prime eligible, and in 3 years they steal the coins from everyone who bought from them.
If you pick a seller with over 5k ratings, you are probably safe as that company has done easily 5-10mil in total sales. But a seller that says just launched, stay the fuck away.

Same person who risks jail time for repeated breaking and entering. They don't make $5k on every house they enter haha.

You can actually sell at spot instead of the 30-40% hit a pawn shop will take. You will have to split it up though, being a new seller, people won't trust you to mail the silver if you're selling thousands of dollars at once. Need to build up some feedback.
