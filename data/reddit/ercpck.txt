The IRS has plenty of $5 wrenches to compel you to pay up.

You can always reduce that by using Euros (bigger bill is 500 euro ~ 560 dollars).... or by using swiss francs (bigger bill is around 1,000 francs ~ 980 dollars). 
That means you can reduce your million dollars to around 1000 bills, that you can easily fit into a fanny pack.

Nop. It is not even close to being the final nail in the coffin. 
The government requires TWO launch providers to consider themselves capable of taking care of issues of national security. 
There was only one provider... ULA... with two rockets (Atlas, and the uber expensive Delta). 
Now there are actually two providers, ULA and SpaceX. For some launches ULA still remains the sole provider (that will probably change soon). 
The nail in the coffin for ULA is when a third launch provider (with a heavy vehicle) arrives. 
And that is fairly uncertain at this point. 
In the meantime, ULA will live, and the shareholders will keep squeezing that "capabilities contract" until they can't anymore. Then lockheed and boeing will move to the next fighter jet or something. 
Bezos, I'm looking at you!

That's why the government requires at least two launch providers, and the reason ULA will live for the foreseeable future. 
Keep in mind, the government is not interested in defending space exploration, but spy satellites and other national security missions that cannot be held hostage by a foreign entity (which in practice they kind of do, since the Atlas depends on made-in-russia engines).
