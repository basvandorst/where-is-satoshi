I moved to Circle for the lower fees but then moved back to Coinbase because of the features. I really like the recurring send (there's a few charities and youtubers I donate to monthly) and vault services (I need that 2 day delay to prevent me from giving away all my bitcoin when I've had too much to drink lol). The fees seem so small to me I don't think about them. It feels like a small donation to Coinbase, like the change you leave in the Starbucks tip jar. Yall are doing a great job!
I help about 10 people a month start Coinbase wallets and it always goes really smoothly.

The government does whatever it can get away with. Suspicionless searches are something most people freak out about if they're aware of it. If police entered people's homes at will and looked through their stuff, they would freak out, but since AML/KYC happens in the background and the average person doesn't perceive it, there's no outcry.
I don't see how you can be for AML/KYC and not be for all kinds of suspicionless searches, without being logically inconsistent. Would you be for a police camera following you around all day if you didn't notice it? It's the same thing and the government will do it, the moment its technologically feasible.

I bet there is very little chance he will bid below market value. If he forces the bitcoin to be sold above market value, then the chances of them later getting dumped on the market in a disruptive way are none. It's like he's shielding the market from what could be a big disruption. If this auction were to happen without us knowing about it, I doubt there would any way for us to notice it by watching the markets. Even if he doesn't want any more bitcoin, I bet he'd be willing to spend the money just to keep the market from getting disrupted.
I bet there is no chance they don't end up selling for at least market value, because he will at least bid that just to protect the market. If someone else wins, then that will show there's at least two people willing to pay at or above market value for that many bitcoin.

I don't understand the circumstances necessary to successfully execute a double spend. What would have to take place for me to pay for a coffee and then run away and keep my bitcoin?
I know this has something to do with why some merchants wait x confirmations before shipment. Is that really necessary? If double spends are rare/impossible, why wait? Are effectively all bitcoin transactions final once they've been broadcast? Are confirmation times irrelevant? About how many times a week/month/year are double spends successfully executed?

Is it more powerful and effective than bitcoin? Is it basically just a centralized exchange that also has it's own currency or is there something actually in the protocol that lets you exchange coins without an intermediary?

When I explain bitcoin to people and they ask how to get some, it sounds super shady when I say you gotta go to this 1 company. Any 1 company thing sounds like a scam. Now when I say, "Take your pick from a couple companies that offer that service," it sounds a lot better.

The red and green lines at the right edge of the graph are a graphic representation of the white numbers, which are buy and sell orders if the price moves to their bids. The bar graph at the bottom is a representation of the red and green numbers on the right which tell orders that have been fulfilled.  The fulfilled orders include many that were not previously bids. Like people who said buy or sell without waiting for it to get to a certain price. 
Those white numbers mean very little because when the price goes up or down most people adjust their bids. You really can't tell if the market is going to move up or down by looking at them cause their constantly adjusting. Not to mention  that at every given moment they're people waiting in the background waiting to buy and sell thousands of coins. A 1000 coin wall make look big, but they never last long.

Short answer: The 7 billion went back into the hands of everyone holding dollars, euros, yuan... but 7 billion spread over so many people, no one perceived the change.
When the marketcap of bitcoin goes up or down, it does so by taking from or giving to the marketcaps of other currencies, like dollars, euros, yuan. Since those other currencies are so much larger, bitcoin's unit price going up hundreds of dollars only creates a tiny imperceptible change to the unit price of other currencies, but the change in value caused by bitcoin is real and calculable, if not measureable. In order for bitcoin to cause a measurable change in the dollar's purchasing power, its gonna to have to go up to something huge like $50,000 per. Then the average person will start to see bitcoin as affecting their life, even if they're trying to ignore it.

I wonder if bitcoin is the real Trojan horse here. Digital currencies are allowed to enter the mainstream thru promises from exchanges that we can be regulated, then as soon as we're in we make transactions anonymous.

These fees seem fair to me. Being able to spend bitcoin everywhere is worth more than $5/month to me. Being able to get cash out at a moments notice is worth more than $3.50 to me. As it is now I can't spend bitcoin on hardly anything, like groceries and gas, and whenever I need to convert to cash it takes 4-5 days. Plus I want them to make money, so other companies will decide its worth it to compete with them.

I've done lots of research on bitcoin, but haven't come across much about anonymity tactics. Can you recommend some good reading on the different methods developers are trying out? Is darkwallet trying to implement more than one method? 
The only way I've heard about is the decentralized coin mixing technique sought out by darkcoin. I actually had some darkcoin until their blockchain got all screwed up. I figured it was a sign I should wait a while, before investing.
Since I'm a bitcoiner, I got my hopes set on darkwallet coming up with something.

My concern is that if Bitcoin doesn't come up with some way to provide better anonymity, it's eventually going to be undercut by some coin that does. I know its difficult to figure out who owns what now, but won't that difficulty decrease as new techniques arise. I imagine it won't be long before everyone knows each other's financial information, if bitcoin doesn't address this.
I imagine marauders in Africa looking up the financial information of whole villages and targeting just the people with funds. Or how weird it would be for me to know the financial information of my neighbors, and they mine.

I went to a chinese restaurant to spend bitcoin to find they only accept it through their website. The restaurant closed at 10, but the website stopped taking orders at 9:30 so I was outta luck. What was annoying about it was the person at the cash register had no idea what I was talking about and I could hear all the cooks talking in the background like I was trying to scam them. I had to point out their own 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' sign like they never noticed it before.
I went to a cafe to spend bitcoin and was successful, but what was odd about it was only the owner could accept it through his phone. I had to give my tip in fiat which pissed me off and he mentioned that I was lucky he was there, because he wasn't usually there that day. Close call I guess.

You encrypt a message with a private key, then send the encrypted message, a public key, and the original message to the network. The network decrypts the encrypted message with the public key and checks if it matches the original message. If it does then you've proven you have the private key without showing it.
It's amazing that somehow the public key can decrypt messages encrypted by the private key. I still haven't figured it out, but I know it has to do with some quality inherent in the elliptic curve used to generate the keys.
Correction (thanks below): You decrypt a message with a private key, then send the decrypted message, a public key, and the original message to the network. The network encrypts the decrypted message with the public key and checks if it matches the original message. If it does, you've proven you have the private key without showing it.

I have a BitGo multisig wallet and I like it. When setting up a wallet with them, they'll ask you to print out a piece of paper with 2 private keys on it. They say that they are able to make the two private keys and send them to you without them seeing it. I'm not sure how that works, but I think it has something to do with how Java can run website programs on your computer without the website seeing it. One of the 2 keys is also stored on the cloud and is retrieved for signatures when you input a password. Again, somehow BitGo doesn't see the password or the key when creates the signature. The 3rd private key you don't see and they keep. Typically the only thing you need to remember is your password. The only reason you'd need the piece of paper with the 2 keys is in case they go out of business or the government shuts down their servers.
I haven't used Greenaddress, but they have a really nice website that makes me think they're legit.
Besides for these two. I don't think there are any other options, except for programming it yourself somehow.

Right now your only option is Coinbase. You need to set up an account with them and give them your banking info. It will take about 4 days for them to verify your bank info, then they'll let you buy $100 dollars worth from them a week. After a month that limit will go up to $1,000 dollars worth a week. After you buy bitcoin from Coinbase I don't recommend keeping it in the account  they give you. I'd move most of it to a different wallet service that allows you to hold your own private keys. I recommend setting up an account with BitGo because they have a nice multisig feature that allows you to keep your funds even if they go out of business like MtGox did.

Also seeing a completely horizontal sell line helped me see how it relates to the bids. And seeing how the last 10000 coins were bought roughly 500 at a time in 20 minutes was enlightening. There is tons of money in the background available to move the market any way it wants. A lack of people with money to buy is never the problem. It's only that they need believe it's a good time to buy. If everyone on the major excahnges suddenly decided to buy I think we could easily go to 3000 per coin in an hour. You're welcome :)

I never felt the need to own a smart phone until bitcoin. I just bought my first smart phone last week and didnt buy apple just bc of that one thing. I'm very happy with android and now that I'm getting used to it, I would buy it again. If I represent a portion of the population, then apple seriously lost some market share.

Can someone explain how they do this? Are they just holding enough bitcoin that they can brute force weather the volatility? They don't actually possess dollars, just the equivalent amount in bitcoin. I'm not a trader, but I've heard it's possible to hedge bids in such a way that you're guaranteed to not gain or lose value. Is that really possible and is that what they're doing?
Like if you had money on an exchange and you had to put it all in long/short bids, is there a way to do that so that you freeze your value? If I was knowledgeable enough, could I freeze the purchasing power of my bitcoin by using the hedging mechanisms of an exchange.

I wish they would extend their enterprise features to regular folks. I would pay $10 bucks a month to have spending limits just in case. It took me a little while to understand what that piece of paper was they make you print out. It's different if you print it out right away or have it emailed to you. It's better to print it out right away. I know it's possible to recover the money if they go out of business, but I don't know how. I figure I can figure it out later, if it becomes an issue, but I wish they would create a youtube video explaining how I to do that. Also I wish there was a video explaining how they are able to create the other two keys and store one of them on the cloud somewhere without them seeing it. And when quantum computers/privacy becomes an issue and I need to change my address every time I spend, I'm not sure how that is going to work.

Sorry to bring up Christianity here, because I figure it's mostly off topic, but I find Oct 31st &amp; Nov 1st interesting. Over time Nov 1st, Hallowmas, became a day when Christians celebrated all the work God had done to preserve the church over the centuries. It was like an early form of Thanksgiving day or Memorial day. Oct 31st, Halloween, became a day when Christians remembered that they still live in a fallen world and that there is still so much to be done in each individuals heart and in society. It's not a coincidence that Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on Halloween. He chose that day on purpose, because on it individuals/society would be especially prepared to consider their faults and listen to suggestions about how to change.
Is it possible that Satoshi had some familiarity with the history of Halloween and sought to use it in the same way? I think so. Should we use Hallowmas to celebrate the advances Bitcoin has made over the past 6 years? Maybe, I kinda think Pizza day works pretty good for that though :)

Theoretically quantum computers can calculate private keys from public keys, but since public keys are only revealed when you spend from an address, as long as you always remove all funds from an address every time you spend from it, essentially never using the same address twice (which should be done anyway for other benefits,) quantum computers become a non-issue.
By the time quantum computers are up and running (at least another 2-3 years), all wallets will work this way by default without people needing to think about it. Most wallets already work this way now.
Quantum computers are supposed to be able to find prime numbers well which is what the relationship between private and public keys depend on. The relationship between public keys and addresses depends on something different that quantum computers won't effect.

I wish there was someway to find out how much of the marketcap is due to day traders, how much is long term investors, and how much is actual daily use. I assume the percentage of the marketcap due to day traders is what causes all the volatility, while the marketcap due to the other 2 are pretty much always going up.

In order to move funds from one address to another you need the private keys. There's no way around that. Since the private keys are private and never broadcast to the network, gaining 51% of the hashing power doesn't give you the private keys, it doesn't give you the ability to spend other peoples funds. What you could do with 51% is prevent transactions from being processed, essentially freezing everyone's accounts. Probably what would happen next is the price would drop and whatever mining pool was performing the attack would be incentivized to break apart in order to get the network going again. No attack would last more than an hour and no ones funds would be lost.
In the event of a 51% attack, it would be completely obvious and within a few minutes most merchants would be directed to cease transactions. An hour later they would get another message saying we're good to go again.

I'm not going to do any more evangelizing without sharing some first. I just wish there was a cafe near by that I could say, "Go spend it."
I like Blockchain's app, because it takes under 2 minutes to set up. The only issue I find with this is occasionally people have phones over 5 years old and the app doesn't work. 
I think people get much more interested in the details when they're actually using it. Things they couldn't care less about, now become interesting, like explaining the difference between public and private keys and what a QR code is. People are noticeably surprised at how fast it moves, when I press send and it appears in their wallet 5 seconds later. Also they find it interesting how you can label addresses and send money like email. They would never take the time to learn these things if I wasn't just giving it to them. I think it's not about the money, its about me removing the risk of them trying it out.

We're in a strange place where philathropy is the one of the best investment options.

You dont have to choose once and for all whether to mine or buy. You can decide minute by minute based on whatever is most cost effective.

When I hear how Andreas uses a separate computer that's never been connected to the internet to sign transactions, it makes me think the ideal situation is to never have keys on my computer even if it's in a special encrypted browser application for just an instant.
This is why I still recommend Circle to my friends, because I research bitcoin all the time and I still don't understand bitcoin security. I think Trezor and BitGo would be perfect together, cause then keys would never be on my computer and if someone steals my Trezor it's only one key. Trezor alone freaks me out, because I don't want spendable bitcoin at my house. BitGo + Trezor + Bank Vault = I feel safe. BitGo + something about the cloud and occasionally keys on my computer + Bank Vault = I'm not so sure. Maybe y'all could come up with some videos explaining how the cloud works, so I could feel better about it.

I imagine that sorta thing will only be for a small portion of online gamers, but those who do like it will probably love it. I'd watch a serious for money street fighter or even chess tournament. A thousand people put in a dollar and 10 rounds of speed chess later somebody gets a thousand bucks.

I first heard about bitcoin in passing while listening to a sports show. I thought it was intersting, so I googled it and one of the first things that came up was your interview with Stefan Molyneux. Andreas, thank you for inviting me on this journey.

In a short time people will pay subscription fees to play video games where you rob banks like in GTA, but the fees will be used to give real payouts, so 1 in a 1000 will actually rob the virtual bank and get the money. The way people gamble with card games will be extended to all games. Fighting other people online in Golden Eye or Halo, will become like poker night.
I also love the idea that becoming a public company will soon be super easy. I can imagine all the stores in my neighborhood being owned by the neighborhood. Thousands of people owning tiny parts of the neighborhood cafe and pizzeria and bar. When someone wants to start a new local business. He doesn't go to the bank for a loan, but hands out fliers and explains his business plan at the town hall, and if it's good one the neighborhood buys in.

I use BitGo, but I'm afraid to ever open my account because I don't really understand how my common use key is stored on the cloud and I imagine it must be possible to track the way I open my account with a virus. I would love something like Trezor used in conjunction with BitGo, but I don't want to go thru the expense until that's an option. Have y'all contacted them?

Nascar is so boring. I think we'd take a marketing hit, if bitcoin was on a nascar. I'd rather see a UFC or soccer sponsorship.

Somehow I've actually come to enjoy the price going down. This is a true boom or bust investment. said it great: "When you're comfortable with the idea of bitcoin going to zero, then you're ready to invest in it." I wasn't there when I started, but I'm getting closer.

Perhaps it's for the best that this is happening now. If it's successful and goes off without a hitch, it will be a great marketing event. It will demonstrate that we will continue to make necessary changes in the future, a huge selling point.
I expect we're going to need numerous hard forks over the next 10 years. We need to do this now to prove that we deserve to keep growing.

The transaction spikes are happening every 2 weeks when the difficulty readjusts and the block time slows down to 10 minutes again. The spikes have been getting worse and worse every 2 weeks. The last one took 3 days to clear. The next one will probably take 4. Eventually the backlog will never clear. The average fee paid in each spike is going up too.

In a few years we will talk about how important the block size limit was, because it forced bitcoin to mature past core's development monopoly.

For the past year I've given away about 20-30 dollars to practically every single neighbor, coworker, friend and stranger I can get an email address from. I used to set them up with Mycelium, but everybody just gets a new phone and forgets to backup. I'm probably out like 3-4k, but I love spreading this thing. I appreciate Coinbase paying me back a little :)

Netflix's real competitor is Bittorrent. If Netflix wants to steal Bittorrent's market share, if creators want to stop giving away tons of content for free, they're going to have to sell everything a-la-cart and for a reasonable price. If a show costs more than a 50 cents, it'll be too much.

If Fold could get a similar deal going with Lowes that would be huge for bitcoin adoption, because of all the general contractors who would use it. With all the business and immigrant relationships they have, it would be a major adoption sparking event I think. Even if it was just 5 or 10%.

I love Fold and use it often, the only thing is sometimes they run out of the $20 starbucks cards. I think sometimes Fold should decrease the discount to 15 or 10% if it would help them keep the larger cards in stock. Starbucks is expensive.

Adam doesn't need Mike's help. He can get whatever he wants implemented into Core by himself. If nothing's getting implemented it's only because Adam doesn't want it. The only way to get bitcoin will scale is if we tear bitcoin away from him. Keep going Mike!!!!!!

I'm a big block, r/btc, coinbase supporter, but I've never understood the complaints of censorship before. No one should complain about censorship in the internet age. Every media platform has a narrative it supports and if you don't like the narrative, just start your own platform. The internet makes that basically free.
The only thing that bugs me about r/Bitcoin is how often the upvotes and downvotes are hidden. When there are a lot of comments in a thread, I like to scroll to the comments with lots of votes so I can easily find the most interesting comments. It doesn't happen all the time though, so I don't know if hiding votes is a r/Bitcoin policy or what.
I disagree with the r/Bitcoin narrative, but it's still useful to me in the same way I check Huffington Post. It's an easy way to see what the other side is saying. Removing Theymos or forcing a change in the narrative of r/Bitcoin would be a much worse kind of censorship in my opinion.

Probably not today, but in a couple years. Since I talk about bitcoin endlessly, people are going to know I was an early adopter.
The goal is to create a wallet form factor where I don't have the ability to send money in under a week, so its not something that can be demanded of me. Just like Andreas' point that even though the raw bitcoin transaction is instant and irreversible, you can add extra layers to delay and reverse it. Multisig does that, but in such a way that puts keys on my computer, which I currently don't think is safe.
I might carefully dabble in possessing my own keys, but I would never recommend it for a friend. I don't even like the idea of paper wallets, because even those were on your computer for a moment. Hopefully Mycelium's Entropy will fix that though, and I'll be getting one as soon as its available.

I'm honestly thinking about getting a cheap laptop or chromebook to be my BitGo computer. Hopefully, by never doing anything but visiting the BitGo website that might make it a little safer.
