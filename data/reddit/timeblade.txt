Congrats.  It looks like a lot of people are having issues. Looks like higher fees are needed.

I tried to send .002 btc last night as a test with a .0001 fee still has not confirmed either. My guess is everyone will have to start using really high fees to get their coins to move fast. If you can import the first address you sent from into another wallet that allows you to spend unconfirmed transactions and resend the same amount of btc with a really high fee , it will confirm and mark the other one as a double spend and confirm the higher fee one.

Did you watch the video? Basically if you have the private key for the first address you can rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee. You don't need to have an extra btc to do so

no it has to be the same amount, supposedly you can get around it with broadcasting the tx again with higher fees and you don't need to have an extra 1 btc. there is a video here that explains how. 
You will need to export your private keys for the addresses you need first.

you could also try sending small amounts to each address in the chain, like .001 to each  1KbKe5uDNRibJ97Ee97oiW3BFXmF5G1qKa
with a high fee like .001 it may force the coins to confirm worth a shot it worked for me once.

it's because the address they came from first  1KbKe5uDNRibJ97Ee97oiW3BFXmF5G1qKa. That's the transaction that needs to confirm first before the next one to 1ERqioK3YGsLfMVU6ZgZeEKL3HQyGeQuzC 
Sorry there is no way to fix that. so low fees sent on that transaction could take a day sometimes.
Wish i had better news.
