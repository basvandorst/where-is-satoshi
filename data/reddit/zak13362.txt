I was in at 3, sold at 7, bought again at 4. Held, lost computer (stolen), was found smashed to bits in some street

I know that now, but I didn't then and there was a craze like with CEX.IO and I got encouraged to invest so I can finish my degree.
What is it? And am I screwed?

But I've never used my coins like that :(

Huh?

Any recommendations for an android wallet?

I like electrum and it's my wallet of choice on the computer but I don't have one of those rn.

Thank you. My bank has done this every time I added them as a payment method on CB. It seems a hit odd they'd start now, but it's certainly an explanation. I wouldn't put it past CB to use this as an excuse. 
Thanks for the Gemini response. That makes me feel better. 
Do you have any tips on what I should ask in my email to coinbase?

Thank you for response! I'm going to go through the process for Gemini. I was halfway through my transition. This just threw a wrench in my flow.

I only sparingly used it and have been in the process transitioning to Gemini the past week because of something I read on this sub. Then this suddenly happens. Why do I deserve this for not hearing about your warnings sooner? Please don't direct your anger at me.

I'd recommend talking to a fiduciary. I used to be a financial advisor and my unofficial advice is to talk to a pro. Mainly to keep taxes low. You're going to want to invest a bunch of the income in more stable places, like high yield savings, bonds, ETFs, some equity. This should generate a steady stream of income for you. 
You've basically won the jackpot, don't start living beyond your means though. It would disappear fast that way. Don't tell anyone about it. You want to avoid people asking you for money and that can sour relationships. 
Also talk to a lawyer, get a will in place, maybe start a trust fund that will accumulate wealth and provide financial security for you and next of kin, or whomever you want really. 
Don't let yourself get scammed out of it either. Poor people are desperate sometimes. I can confirm since I'm currently poor and mad jelly bc I lost 50btc on a HDD I scrapped when it was 3/BTC. Really happy for you though. Please update us in a month or two with what you did. If you want more advice or have questions my inbox is open.
