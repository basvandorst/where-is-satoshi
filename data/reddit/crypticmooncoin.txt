Hey, I just want to say I really admire what you're doing - it takes tremendous character to take that kind of personal windfall and to focus outwards, on improving the world and the lives of others. Thank you for being such a positive role model for this community!
It looks like you already have a good handle on incredible organizations to support, but if you're looking for another, smaller one, I'd encourage you to look into [Camp Kesem]( It's a student-run summer camp on more than 50 college campuses around the country, and it provides support for children whose parents have or have had cancer. It was one of the most impactful groups I've ever been a part of (as a counselor), and it fosters an incredible sense of community between kids who are all struggling with these really difficult, confusing experiences. 
Thank you again for choosing to use your funds for philanthropic causes!

But how did you take the picture??

Wait, does that actually make sense? Assuming you're investing the same amount of fiat either way, it's about the fold-change - returns are going to be 1.5x better if you get in at 6k than at 9k (e.g. if BTC is at 72k, you'll have made 12x your initial investment if you entered at 6k, and only 8x your initial investment if you enter at 9k). I get that the sentiment is just hop in when you have the cash, but it's patently false that entry point doesn't matter.

Just clicking through the transaction trail - if you follow the largest sum of BTC when they're sent to new addresses, it takes you to this terminal node.

Your dad's got the best references, everyone knows that.

And if you follow that transaction trail, it looks like it's still held by one person, who is still active and who continued to accumulate along the way (to the tune of 50,000 BTC). So that transaction started a process that minted a BTC hundred-millionaire.

Ah, the one that goes on to inherit Willy Wonka’s empire? :)
