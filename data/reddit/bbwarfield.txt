A refitted aircraft carrier would hold how many drones in the space of 1 jet? Different types of drones would need different storage slots, but many would not need complex elevator systems to get them to the runway. You would be able to remove how many support staff? so there living areas are smaller. Storage for food and human supplies drops drastically. How many crew you really need? Keep witting away the human numbers and your ship can hold an invasion force of incredible effectiveness. Automated security systems with kinnect type identification or shot on site (visitors are not welcome to the Bitcoin navy!) Medical staff drops as all you need is a fraction of the original maintenance men. No support aircraft as you ship new parts and supplies through amazon drones that would be given a "free to fly" code as they come into it's air space. 
Dam.... I hope the US navy never figures all this out.... well... part of my pride wishes they would ; )

As a humanitarian project... a non-profit "Universal Financial Relief" foundation could be created for scenarios like this,  scenarios that are unfortunately increasing becoming realities. You have literature ready to print and send in many different languages. Areas in more precarious situations would be translated the soonest. Ukraine, Thailand, and India all are having degrees of struggle right now. Typically with unforeseen problems, (Japans Tsunami, Philippines Hurricane, Haiti.... the list goes on) Bitcoin would not help a population as they tend to become closer as they deal with national tragedy. It would be harder for them to change currency as it represent national pride in a time when they need that.
The non-profit would just disseminate through the existing Bitcoin network, material educating on the basics of Bitcoin and how it can act as a "personal reserve currency" in times of uncertainty. Gold may be universal, but Bitcoin is accessible and portable.  
I know Bitcoin isn't the answer to ALL the worlds problems, but it seems theres a bit of a humanitarian good that can be done in the educating of securing assets in an uncertain political climate.

Keep in mind that we need to add depth to the supply chain. Any store that gets added needs at least two suppliers that accept bitcoin (this was our teams strategy when we were coming up with our version) With a deeper supply chain it removes the doubt of "how will I turn it into cash!" for the vendor. They just need to have someone below them in the supply chain till you get dang near the bottom. That person is fine cause they just go to the top of the supply chain and get what they need.

Do you know someone who could use this service? i was talking to a friend earlier who was going on a missions trip. Its nearly impossible to get funds where hes going once he is there so they have to have all of it up front and exchanged immediately on arrival. With Bitcoin I told him you could go to so many countries and have instant coins sent you can use (China?) that anyone can send and get you what you need. Cuts out the banking bureaucracy that inflicts so much pain on people doing good work! (Even your standard charitable non-profit.... theres a place that buys goats for needy families and alot of the money gets lost in over seas transmission...not with Bitcoin!)
You have public speaking skills? Rent a hotel meeting room for a day and do a charge ten bucks an attendee to show them how it works... set up there first wallet and give them .0001 bitcoins to put in it and trade between the attendees. Maybe go up a step and find a local restaurant wanting to add bitcoin and have them cater (or meet at the restaurant... many have meeting spaces) the event and accept that .0001 bitcoins you gave them as payment for the meal. Then there basically paying for the meal and you can make some money for your effort. What waiter wouldnt love all those bitcoin tips they collect directly to there wallet as they wait your group!

We do not like government favoritism in the market place either. By not enforcing a law any small business or retailer would have to comply with, it is giving Banks a favoristic treatment over other businesses. Banks are a business. If the government allows different rules, it is no longer a free market. We can suck it up to either prove we do not have a free market, or to hold the government to its word: "the law"

The US dollar use to represent the holdings in gold of the US treasury, that was how it was valued. Since there is NO central bank for this global currency what would you say it should be valued on? Our good faith and credit in the total world population that currently holds bitcoins on exchanges? Thats our current system, if you don't believe me, look at how much "faith" a reiteration of the same policy did for the price today. China didn't say anything new. Nothing changed today except the "faith" in China bring the bitcoin value "TO THE MOON!"

Because of lack of infrastructure growth Bitcoin actually is set to do well in this environment (Especially Africa).

Caveat: Some municipalities require it regardless... most only for cash.... but we prefer to keep people thinking we check every time. There suppose to check at Walmart. But now everyone swipes a card and they never see it to confirm anything. Credit card companies  want you too have 0 hassle and rather deal with fraudulent charges than people to continue using cash. They would never publicize that... but truth is there own merchant service lines have a "phoned in" option they send you to if you never saw the card. And they NEVER ask if you checked an ID.

I thank you for pointing that I was missing something. I think the seller should adjust prices accordingly and base it off the local currency. But rather than 10% off just give the number of Bitcoins you want that will most likely equal the same dollar amount. Its very annoying to go in some place and have to go "10% off eh? So the $9.78 chicken wings will be .98 cents off... then if your going with Mt. Gox 3 day rolling average..... that would be .0023578.... hmm.... wait maybe btce passed them in trade volume... yup... so its really gonna be .0033576... okay... hmm oh the ribs look good... and 10% off I can get that unlike usual.... so there $14.52" ex cetera... ex cetera... Id end up paying cash and keep the coins as an investment...  those bit coins will never get circulated as they should cause I just can't figure out all that every time I look at a menu or service list. You tell me its .0022576 and Ill calculate it on how I value bitcoin and decide if its worth it to me.

yes... but I am assuming people who bought during a boom would turn it off or resell taking it out of effective circulation. It will find a home but it will at a point be turned of and views as a paper weight if prices are lower than the person had hoped and they cannot resell. (I could sell a laptop right now as a miner... but the person who buys it would not use it at currently price/difficluty ratio.... only turn it on when they are $5million a btw would be profitable)

We do not need... but should have acceptance not animosity from governments. If the consumers and savers accept it then it will succeed with or without the government. Animosity from or toward the government will delay the inevitable and I don't want Bitcoin to be a thing my children and grandchildren reap the benefits of... I want to live in that world too! If we are responsible about some aspects we can grow it much faster. Certain things we will need to put our foot down on and say "NO" . Taxes are not the problem, I gladly will pay taxes to fix roads and pay for basic services people long ago handed over to the governments to take care of as they did not see a benefit in managing it privately. But remember.... there was a time someone gave to much and now we are reaping the devils share on those decisions... Let's be responsible but firm in why we agree to what we agree to when it comes to government interactions like taxes and basic regulations (like fraud and theft)

And fees are good for miners as it pays them a bit more... I often wonder how much fees will be of the block when it really starts getting used for the purposes it was designed for. Slushes pool had a block with 0.24767218 in additional fees to the 25 for the block. Imagine if the current average went from 20 to 40 or 60 day (based on real usage not just exchange trading as higher volume days have seen many more fees than that) you would add potential a whole extra coin each block. Even if every block is mined... there would be reason enough to keep going for the fees any way. (by that point the 1 or 2 it creates would be much much more valuable despite the lower number)

Cannot speak to the validity of the story... but I can speak to the misconceptions that are exhibited by professionals in the tech fields. 
People call it "Silicon Valley Thinking"  or something of that nature. (And it applies to more than one thing... so if you know the phrase it may not be the same definition I learned when I first learned it) But its an isolation that comes amongst highly intelligent people that believe everything new is immediately understandable to them. It's why Microsoft and many older tech companies make really strange decisions. (Ford motor company was a very early example of this.. till Robert Mcnamara ran the show, the accounting department simply "weighed" the bills and budgeted based on the weight of the paper they were printed on... and they were proud of the efficiency!)
But I learned it the hard way. I talked with someone who worked for one of the largest companies in the US as a design team head in micro-processors (company name withheld to protect the ignorant). I was very excited about the new iPad and was interested in his thoughts of where it was going... I was very exuberant about "cheap POS systems" new peripherals, the ability to use them for high end store displays (I was not terribly inventive as most were retail applications) and how it was spelling doom for the netbook industry and could start eating into laptop sales, or be bought by older folks in lieu of any computer.
What he responded with made my jaw drop. "I think it's a fad... no one cares about these type of innovations and in a few months it will be a glorified leap frog or other children's toy." 
"Have you seen one?" I asked.... he said he had had... but wasn't impressed. This man worked with teams that built the worlds fastest chips, and his company was also a supplier for Apple!  and he wasn't impressed. I asked him to explain more. He said "Not one person in the whole building has an iPhone... maybe some of the top level execs but none of the line level techs. They still have blackberries and regular phones." Are you aware that in your area you can't buy iPhones?" (true at the time because of some strange rule with older cell companies the entire region he was in could not buy AT&amp;T services which was exclusive up until a little bit before)  "Oh yes.... but its no great loss... and I'm sure if they wanted to these guys could hack the phones to get them to work here any way, I just think no one would pay for a phone when they can get one for free with contract. Also theres nothing earth shattering about any thing with the iPad or iPhone." I was saddened that I had fallen into the madness and craze (as I thought this guy had all the knowledge about technologies in the world!) 
see him few years later and his whole family is on Windows phones...... really? really? And he loves their Slate! He says he just trusts Microsoft cause they "set the industry standards in UI's now"
My point is this.... just cause you work for a major company, and have the doctorates and are patented.... doesn't mean you understand everything to do with the massive world of technology! (I learned they are extremely narrow focused and are not Peter Thiels or Ellon Musks to get to the top in an old school Fortune 500.... you get tunnel vision so you can focus on what you do.... in the field he is in, he is probably one of the top 100 people... but he's got tunnel vision so he can stay in the top 100!)

@_date: 2013-12-04 06:57:21
Heres the truth about investing in bitcoins. Its not like the US dollar where maintaining the currency is worth more than earning it with actual labor or a product. Bitcoins are best gained by providing a product or service that the market wants! Mining is fine but it was more of a "Early adopter? Good were going to reward you and reward you big for joining early... helping us grow.... and believing in it enough to not sell at $1.20 a coin... youll be able to keep making money mining cause you can reinvest"
But that is not the BEST way to get Bitcoins.... There are thousands of great business ideas that were not profitable or feasable because of fiat-central-bank currencies and there manipulations of its value. With Bitcoin you can! Tim Ferris wrote the 4 day work week and 90% of the book I find was already so over used it was unprofitable.... but with Bitcoin many are fantastic!  One idea is trolling for stale patents. He gives a link to patents that are public domain from lack of use or renewal. Bitcoin solves some of the problems with them or can integrate several of those ideas into a new one with bitcoin being a previously unknown glue that make them just make sense. Touchscreens were crazy till Apple got several small crazy ideas together and made it all into one device that just made sense! (not that any of them were "new" but not presented that way before and Apple was one of few who could do that presenting)

if an egg is usually .00001 bit coins, who cares how the dollar value fluctuates because of speculation on the out break of some bird sickness? If theres less eggs than it will cost more.... if supply out paces demand... then it goes down. But speculators will try to buy stock in eggs assuming these things.... which is why price no longer has meaning. Now they HAVE to sell the eggs at speculative value and not real value.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:24:22
Why does it fluctuate? Cause people are thinking of it only as an investment medium. One that is about profit and not trade. I get it... I'm in to make money too. But I get the principles behind it and how its an economic instrument for trade, not just wealth generation.
Gold fluctuates on speculation, as does bitcoin. Canada's dollar fluctuates on its economy, its GDP, its trade balance with other nations, but primarily on real things like its resources (whether it is simply physical resources or manpower) but there are real factors of industry and commerce behind its value. Central banks of course tweak these numbers, but countries like Canada tend to not let the banks over correct. So its currency reaches a parity. A Canadian dollar is always worth a Canadian dollar. It can trade for more or less than other currencies true.... but there is a fairly stable exchange rate based on the countries actual production and capabilities. 
Bitcoins and gold fluctuate because they are being used heavily for saving and wealth generation. Some commerce, but it does not represent any of your base raw material sales. It has no deep roots in its use to sustain a rise in its price beyond China's actual usage. (We hold alot in the US and don't use it. Chinese use it!)
Were getting better, but there are tipping points and if you don't reach them, your relegated to the rubbish bin of fads and extreme manias.

Why is Gold valuable? Cause people think it is. In the United States it cannot buy you anything. It can only be exchanged for cash to do so, or traded to people for goods with that person looking to use the gold at some point to turn into cash. I throw a gold coin into a crowd and everyone will run for it. Why? Magical healing powers? Maybe someone need the gold to make a semiconductor?.... probably not. Probably cause they can sell it and turn it into cash to buy a semiconductor or medicine. But really the coin has not true value to any of them, simply its ability to be exchanged into a currency to purchase goods. Skip the middle man. Bitcoin is only good now to make more fiat currency. To replace any of them you will need to disassociate from any specific currency. Will it reach parity? Yes eventually it would. But it needs to stand on its own first, and not just be boosted up by the masses looking for an investment to turn to fiat, and not an endrun around fiat.

Sellers get the bitcoins. That they use to buy goods in there supply chains. We need to realize until you can buy all raw material in a supply chain with ฿, we cannot have a producing economy that is free of central banking. Atlas Shrugged is a great book with a cliffnotes movie that goes straight to the heart of the idea. Society does not value producers. Without them there is no true wealth, only a facade that will crumble. 
I know I hype it all up, but we need to think were it can go and how to get there with a solid foundation, not just a bubble selling people on quick riches with an infrastructure that cannot support its valuation.

If you business can sell gift cards, you can also sell them at a discount if you got them at a very very good price. (You have some fluctuations so you may be able to buy much more in GYFT than you could have with the cash from the original sale) so If you sell a $100 item for BTC and the price goes up... you can buy $150 dollars of GYFT cards.... but with the discount you can buy the cards cheaper to begin with.... sell a $150 dollar card for $125's. Also there are the transaction fees you will be saving on (mileage will vary)

I get "you give a lot of money to a known drug front. We will not process payments to it and turn any attempted payments to Federal Authorities"
THAT I can understand. But this is selective practices based on them protecting themselves from financial loss if Bitcoin goes to big, not financial loss of "we got the transaction fees". It is a protectionist move that most law is clearly against.

In much of Africa there is a need for a currency that is exchangeable. Bitcoin is that currency, as it is not linked to a regime. Nations use to grow there by being backed by a "superpower" Cecil Rhodes my friends... he backed Africa big for the Brits... and that was some of the most stabilization in many of its poorer countries. Of course it was used to rape the natural resources and ended up creating apartheid... but... that was greed and other factors... not economic growth in general

Non profits of all kinds should look at Bitcoin. I have said many time Mission Boards should use it for "in the field funding" of teams or missionaries in areas with more robust Bitcoin economies. Think of the saved money in banking fees?!?! (The one to get the mission board the money from the credit card {which many won't take to begin with} the wire transfer to foreign bank... the exchange value loss... then just the wait {ever seen a missionary ask for funds for a car problem and then two mission letters later its "stopped at bank to see if funds were in" and they are still not getting the car even started to be fixed!

I had a good idea about this before but not to get into too much detail but what if a reddit like music (I know about sound cloud) let you up vote a song and get it as  a download.... all independent artists only available digitally through this service.... but each time its up voted and downloaded it cost .000000001 (or such) more bit coins up to something in the fiat range of a typical album. Early adopters would be able to say "I bought that Meat Crawl album when it was just .000001... what did you get it at?" (Hipsters rejoice as you have a legit way of saying how cool it was before it was cool and the transaction number to prove it!)  Theres a lot more too it but Im keeping the good stuff till I can find some people to help me make it happen and I don't think I can tell a copyright court "its on reddit and I posted it there long before they did it!" .... but I think that would also be antithetical to the bitcoin communities beliefs about copyrights over property rights (Ideas have a life of there own and should be allowed to find there own way of working out without people stifling them cause they are similar to an idea they did nothing with)

We have to set it. Which is hard. I have suggested the community set "Detachment day".
A well publicized day when everyone will correct to there price based on the costs of raw material. 
It may take a year or two.... but we set finite items at a set price (it will change... cause supply and demand does) but on that day we arbitrarily (which I know sound abhorrent but WE would need to suck it up for one day to never do it again) set what the value of a bitcoin is! 
A full ist of raw materials and supply chain items would need to be made to determine there real price in bitcoin. 
When D-Day happens (please lets not call it that as not everyone was on the same side in that war and this is a currency with out borders, but for this conversation I will use it) we already would have found parity.
Its like an IPO date.... Facebook says "it will sell at x a share" and in the ramp up it equals out to that price per share for no other reason than thats the IPO rate. 
D-day would be Bitcoins IPO and fluctuate naturally from that day forward on the basis of real economics and supply and demand.

I would focus on this current crash as the best thing that could ever happen. This will correct as people step back and realize it is not about the value of a bitcoin compared to the dollar, but its value in what it can buy in real goods. I have been talking about "detachment day" the day that we buy a good with a Bitcoin based only on the price. (price being a informative figure that tells us the cost of its constituent parts and they scarcity of its raw materials or knowledge to create the object) .01 bit coins is the price of bread because the cost of  labor is .005 and flour (and all the other ingredients) is .001. The diluted cost of advertising and storage space is .001. So with .o03 being the profit you have a full idea of the scarcity of the raw materials and a real value to a bitcoin. 
Currently the  misnomer of "price" is based on exchange value. 
Example: "It costs me $1.25 so to make a profit I will charge $2.50, thats equal to x bit coins..... so its that amount. "
This current "crash" is good because when it corrects it shows a real world usage value.

I nominate the Phi symbol as a decimal symbol somewhere in bitcoin...... its the golden ratio..... I think it doesn't need to represent any specific thing about Phi  itself but simply an homage to the day it reached 2/3 value of gold to the decimal point of the US dollar at that time.... 
Most of us are nerdy enough to enjoy that trivia with our kids "Ya the phi symbol represents the decimal place where bitcoin passed 2/3 of gold in value..... gold use to be a way to hold an investment in a durable good before the digital age made the necessity to hold onto such a commodity, because of central banks, obsolete." "Did you use gold like we use bitcoins?" "No.... the government wouldn't let us. But when I was a kid it stopped being illegal for us to own it, which was pretty cool."

They have a "digest" that says the information on there server hasn't changed. I think it still is heavily invested in trust that they didn't "steam open" the digest and replace the data. They do have a vested interest in not doing such a thing, but if ALL the copyright was on the block chain and the reading script was open source, even if the service does shut off, all the data is still available. I am limited in my knowledge of how much data the block can take but even if its only 5 or six words you can still have the company do thousands of micro transactions with the linking data. The master wallet  could handle thousands of transactions but the "bit right" wallet would include all of your specific ideas transactions, keeping it completely walled off from the rest of the world.

We lost China's exchanges. We have little in the way of hard numbers to know how much goods and services are being traded (at least that I have seen). China may WANT the speculation to stop as people are hoarding them rather than using them for goods and services. If I was able to control this I would. Speculation causes the swings, use creates parity in prices. 
Example: If I buy this coffee today at .0001 then tomorrow it would be worth $100 dollars, I should not spend it. Now that coffee shop has little reason to continue to use them as ever coin the get is potentially more but they are getting less. Also the shop owner must constantly watch the prices so that when he's selling a $3 dollar coffee he is not selling it for .00001 cents or pricing himself out of the market cause its at $15 dollars.
Speculation makes real life use very difficult for those who accept them with out rate parity.

@_date: 2013-12-05 07:25:20
Valid. I think the exchanges make up almost all the value right now. Black Friday definitely moved some bitcoins into sales for goods, wich drove the price up naturally as people needed them to buy the items in bitcoins. But now people have returned to holding them. Bitcoin is a (and I may be speaking out of school here) an example of a potential deflationary currency. It has no way to truly inflate if its tied to real goods and a good definition of "price" as its meant to mean. But exchanges will have to artificially inflate it (people not using or selling but just holding) to maintain the higher rates if we only see small real world use. But if its value is tied to real world goods and services, as more of the 21 million go into circulation from mining, then it will cost less to buy the same goods as time goes on.  (NOTE: This is completely not true initially cause people don't realize that you have a finite amount that you'll need to move decimals to add the bitcoins once the upper limits reached. This will happen sooner (in my opinion) as people recognize that the 21 million cap is a reality that exists even if they remainder are not in circulation. (Example: a trust fund has $1 million dollars in it.... over time that is fractionaly released to you. You have $1 million dollars you just do not have access to all of it till a set date in the future. You can still borrow against it cause it is real. You still have $1 million dollars even if you cannot spend it immediatly.) Bitcoin will has 21 million as it market capitalization. That wont change. Its when pegged to a currency (yes actually a form of "price") that we judge it current market cap because it is a simple way to do it. 
Bitcoin is a new school of economics, Even my excitement shouldn't deter people from seeing that ; )   . 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:32:03
So much is hypothetical but I will run a quick scenario: It is a well advertised day. Every Bitcoin owner would know about it. People would be buying like crazy and running up the price so they would have Bitcoins for 0 hour. Because anyone not participating would find themselves unable to sell their product (Oh I can buy a Ford Focus for 12.5฿  *in there minds $15,000*  when you could buy a Lamborghini for .05฿ *irrelevant cause that just the value of a Lamborghini in bitcoin*) While everyone who did would in a few days have built a sales infrastructure internationally and already made a tidy income off there sizable bitcoin holdings once the price is stabilized.But why spend it back in fiats? You can still sell them to folks but why? You can take your ฿ to any vendor and buy more than you ever could with the USD after exchange. (You buy a box of cereal with .00000005฿  wich is more sensable than converting that into $50 and buying it for $2.75 with coupon)
Will this happen? probly not. But I think some discussion should be going to "how do we move to a fully fledged currency" playing in the big leagues? US dollars buy more than there exchange value in other countries cause their goods are priced in there currencies and don't care about the exchange rate in general. A Vietnamese Suit make still makes a $1200  suit but they recieve maybe $50 value worth of the local currency. They still sell it for $1200 worth of goods.... but they can never move to the US and spend that $50 the same way even though thats the "exchange rate" for that amount of their currency.
I'm looking for ideas on how we might judge that time and date.... rather than waking up and say "oh... bitcoin doesn't really care about the value of other currencies" cause that could be awhile unless we can come up with a way to guide that growth.
Is this the best idea? Probably not.... Smarter men than I would need to look at it and sell the idea for quite awhile. But I think its a day we all should keep an eye out for and help happen.

Anyone who has a service based loan request can file separately. If you provide sufficient proof that you are providing services: rental time on miners, business consultation, or physical goods with a Bitcoin payment channel; you can prove that you should have gotten the lone on the Banks criteria, as repayment on the loan does not require Bitcoin itself but the ability of the business owner to repay the loan. 
I was told last night by a loan auditor that any Bitcoin business would be denied based on it being the same as asking for money to buy stock in Apple. (I will not divulge as it was in confidence and the conversation was of unrelated business) But that would be provable if there are denied loans based on sound business planning that would have received funding it Bitcoin was not in the proposal.
The legal ramifications of these letters is a thin end of the wedge.

People taking all there bit coins out of the exchanges and buying real goods and services at the bottom of the supply chain. (Building supplies, tractors, land, any base supply item that is a means of industry or commerce)  then growing that supply chain based on a set value that is detached from exchanges. 
Not going to happen if people only view Bitcoin on its exchange value. Exchanges are the offspring of the broken central banking system we are trying AVOID..... they are a symptom that we decided was a good short term way to make money.... now bitcoin has the same disease and if we come out of this correction, well need to seek treatment.

Ron Paul cautimistically said that Bitcoin would be involved in the collapse of the dollar (with a lot of if's when and then's) The banks gave us the rope, to reign them in. The dollar needs confidence, and if the courts uphold this, its a sign the laws of this nation can work (confidence grows) if the courts deny these claims, then clearly the dollar is not subject to law {which it really isn't but the perception HAS to be there} then the system is so broken that there would be no faith in the dollar.

I have an excellent idea for a time machine.... For data transmission only of course. If you take a hose and fill it with ball-bearings when you push one in, one comes out the other side instantly. If you had a binary code of one ball-bearing for a 1 and two ball bearings for a 0... with a long enough hose (jupiter and back) you could receive an answer faster than light! Of course you would do this with atoms and it would need to be frictionless.

Absolutely right. If you know a wallet ID you can trace ALL transactions to and from it. You require all businesses that have government contracts to accept funds only with registered accounts. After tgat the may transfer to private wallets. So the FBI budget is immediately a wallet out of the national budget wallet. The department of education tge same. We could see ever step of tge budget down to a department level..... How's that for budget accountability!

The protocol itself does make it a self-regulating economy when it comes to mining (think a machine that tuned itself to put out exactly one new sprocket {or what have you} every 10 minutes...it would self regulate to make sure it never got faster or slower) ... on the other hand it does not regulate speculators or the use of the coins... only the way of transmission

I'm sorry. I just have difficulty with "their and there". I will try harder to correct this.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:02:13
And it is unfair of me to say ALL value right now is speculative. There is a good degree of the cost of mining creates a price based on the cost it took to mine the coin. A miner worth his salt would ask a fair price for the work in releasing those coins from the system. But that can only account for so much. Also there are real goods and services purchased with Bitcoin and that adds to its value as well. But I think we can all agree that the majority of its current value is based on speculation and not realistic expectations based on current numbers in these two areas. This will need to be corrected for.

To see if there is a real value based on raw materials that would give us a basis of price (cost of all forms of raw material in a service or good) in Bitcoin.

Do you have a early level supplier in your area? (not sure of the technical term, but a business that supplies to other companies and doesnt sell finished product to the public (lumber yards come to mind)
They more a companies supply chain accepts it the more willing they are to accept it from there customers! "Oh... I can buy my lumber and tools from Bob's hardware with those things? I do alot of business with them... maybe I should accept them for my buiilding contracts... Ill still get cash but Bob gives me a much better rate with Bitcoins so I can save on my cash paying progects." 
Then it goes to the next level... "My general contractor uses bitcoins and actually prefers them... maybe if we sold a few houses in our development with them we could save some money too!"
"My neighbor hood is filled with these crazy rich Libertarians with cars and houses they bought with bitcoins... maybe my fortune 1000 company should take them?"

As a libertarian minded person, I wish not to involve the idea of "The government must MAKE you accept our business"
But Banks enjoy Government protections that other industries do not. They have a level of accountability above that of Whole Foods or Amazon or any business that does not have the right to selective selling but also is not protected by the Government. 
No business is "to big to fail" and once the government claims that status... they should be more accountable than free enterprising businesses that should be allowed more freedom in these areas.

I say IF the Chinese people are familiar with the current identification processes and are use to them, this is a good workaround. I know most of us do not like the idea, but a lot of us are westerners who do not enjoy giving out this much information. {but most of us join loyalty clubs for grocery stores and then allow them to track all our purchases and credit cards, then we get something like "fuel perks" at a local chain of gas stations and they piggy back onto the grocery stores card so they now know everything we buy at both places (our card numbers are attached once they make the connection) and they know where when and how we purchase... but if asked for all that we would never do it}

Its okay. I have a genius IQ (tested in high school) and qualify for MENSA. I've worked for Governors and several lower state offices. I have held two world records (one was a group effort but as the organizer the certificate was in my name). I drank a water bottle with Alan Greenspan (we didn't talk about economics I was there for the hearing and didn't want to bother him with that. besides we were not going to agree but I admired his intelligence in his heyday) So I'm not terribly concerned about being called imbecilic on the internet as I am well aware of my mental acuity. I just got over the flu and am working turnarounds at work.  I have social deficiencies and find it hard to communicate ideas so I rarely share them. Some are terrible. Some are phenomenal but I cannot explain easily as I ramble and jump around as I though I had shared the middle information all ready. I will re-post with correct formatting and have a friend spell check for me. I understand that while I communicate well in person I do not come across on paper in a way that speaks to a broad range of people.  I speak to one person at a time and develop the idea with them. Its the only way I'm good at and I will need to practice speaking for general consumption.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:19:11
Services would need be calculated as part of this. You are correct. 21 million bitcoins must be able to account for service based things. Some services are calculate able though. I work at a hotel. Our hotel sells a service and consumes a specific amount of raw material (including labor) to create that service. We set the price on that (our profit is whatever the price is above the costs) The building cost around 2.5 million to build but is valued at 10 million as it is a service provider that represent potential income. 
A lot of things to calculate.... much more than I will be able to do.

I agree with that simply because if you are a company that makes the big leap (first adopter in there "level") and regulators say its a no go.... theres a lot of egg on there faces and legal hoopla backing out of a currency they would need to keep large amounts on hand if they were serious. Regulators will never shut down Bitcoin because its not about companies and the banks.... its about individuals and there right to know what the price of something is again! We are living in an age where the price is set not by supply and demand (scarcity) or actual scarcity of its materials, but an amount of currency we pay to be aloud to own or consume that product. Bitcoin will eventually let us set current ideas about cost and profit to be thought of differently. We will be able to break free of the current structures that enslave us to our lives being worth $7.75 an hour or any set rate (higher or lower). It will let those who want to ask for fair payment for fair work.

If a bank refused you service for using a lawn mowing service another bank uses, it would be illegal... this is a legal parallel. A niche service purchase shows up on your bank statement, and that service is in competition with the bank, they cannot cancel your account for the presence of competition. There are laws.

As a business owner I would look at your supply chain and see what can be purchased for your business with Bitcoin... many have pointed out the consumer side (GYFT) but if you buy all you office supplies through staples you can get a hefty discount (I thought it was 30% and 3% BTC back at one point but cannot remember) by using GYFT .... you get the instant saving and you have a simple way to put them to work for you. Once you hit the buy button on the cards you have "locked in" the value (for good or bad) and can use those cards at any time. So when you accept them I suggest you "pre-budget" your expenses for your business that would be purchasable through GYFT (or directly if you have the option) 
You will not lose money as you have just pre-allotted x dollars for specific purchases. I am sure you can look at your expense accounts and see how much goes to each of those companies (or style of companies) a year and simply buy the gift cards immediately. Its like having a pre-paid account with that vendor.

One problem I see with the search for intelligent life (which I know this was just about life... they preferred not to speculate on if its sentient or intelligent) is that we have no realistic expectations of similarities. Arsenic based life forms have been found here on earth (in hot springs) and their evolutionary track (I believe in guided evolution: just a disclaimer... but I can put aside personal beliefs for academic purposes) will probably not resemble our in any way. They want to look for certain atmospheric chemical signatures... well they may have completely different means of production or they could be some kind of rare base life form (we are carbon based... but there are other things that may be unthought of to us) they would leave NO similar signatures. What if they are closer to trees? (wild speculation) we would find a world with "life" but assume no significant intelligence cause of a lack of evidence of industrial revolution style production (negligible  sulfur in the air for instance)  but a civilization with more in common with plants would make a cleaner environment and possible be in danger cause of NO greenhouse gasses from over consumption of its Co2 supplies. (I get that it doesn't work that way but It's all Science-Fiction till it just becomes fiction)

It would have to be a well orchestrated event. You would have to have critical mass so that those who don't adopt it will simply not see sales as would happen in any true free market. 
I posted on how Vietnamese bespoke suits cost $50 USD once exchanged (prices have changed so its a rough estimate)but it still buys the equivalent of its real value in there local currency. The suit maker may become very wealthy and own all sorts of assets but he will never be able to turn his local currency into USD and get fair value. 
Fee.org reminded me of something important. Real price is a piece of information. Its a way of signalling scarcity of an item and what constitutes it. Price of milk goes up with scarcity, so we see that increase to alert us to this change.But now we have no idea of real value cause prices do not reflect the original idea of it being an informative symbol for its scarcity of resource.
My game would have some see it as an investment... and some will make plenty. But for bitcoin to be a true currency and not a massive get rich quick scheme it will have to do what currency is intended for. Easy barter between two people with an agreed means of exchange for goods and services based on the scarcity or convenience of service or product. If its value is only ever pegged to the exchanges it will be an investing tool like the deeds of underwater mortgages held by banks before the collapse. They know they are worthless but they traded between themselves just to make money off each other.
Like I said.... I want to get people talking about how we will move Bitcoin into having value for its use... not its ability to be turned into a profit in another fiat currency.

I apologize. I cannot proof read due to a unknown psychological defect. In college I was allowed to have all works proof read before hand by the teacher for these kinds of errors. My brain cannot re-read the same information without supply the majority of it from memory of the first reading. So if I thought "their" and typed "there" my brain will not read smaller words and I can re-read it five times and never see the errors. I can proofread other peoples work, but I have to do it all in one reading. 
The school should have helped me over come it instead of bypassing the problem, but I recognize the problem does lie with me to come up with a coping mechanism. Usually it is to have someone else type things out, but in the fast pace of reddit, this is not an option like e-mails.

Its a bank run of sorts and this is one solution to letting things even out. I think it won't work in the end cause it will just fuel fear but it makes sense to do this rather than shut it all down or delay transactions. It gets the volume down till things stabilize.

And I'll stoke that fire as much as you like... follow me and I will bring you to a land far beyond anything you could ever imagine. A new dimension, the circle jerk dimension to be more than precise! When the Apostle Paul (the numerical value of his Kardassian name written in Hebrew and multiplied by PHI is equal to 21 million and it is only a total of 8 decimal places) wrote to Colonel Sanders the secret recipe too good chicken, immortality, and the great mysteries of "the block chain" (which in Aramaic comes from "ark of the covenant" and is translated Sangria in Spain and the Upper West Side) 
He spoke of this event. We were warned by the flatlanders of a dimension behind our wildest wetdreams! But a darkness would grow upon the fertile moon and the fabled SAYERS OF NAY would cast their hoary hands out upon the Reddit Sea... turning it into Jello. (I shall spare you the whole Bill Cosby being a false prophet thing cause it just cause so many wallet splits in my bitcoin commune) But suffice to say.... I know theirs crazy shit and people that can't tell you the name of the Federal Reserve Chair on the internet. And theirs crazies who can tell you all about the Federal Reserve and its inner workings and take you all through history and accurately describe the first financial transactions. Its the internet, theirs rocket scientists and criminals. 
 **If I thought this was a circle jerk I would have labeled it appropriately.**
It was my understanding people preferred bombastic language in order to accept relatively complex ideas that they do not have a knowledge base to understand. I have terrible skills with mass communication, I typically do my best work with one on one consulting, I don't do groups.
So I'm sorry you view it that way and didnt take the time to ask a question. Cause apparently you have the world fairly well figured out. In all serious I understand this sounds crazy. But more businesses fail cause they never really figure out what they were. Bitcoin needs to be more than a minority currency that is backed by speculation. It needs to be used to buy physical goods or services.... or it will rot like the over used tulip bulb analogy.

I have a miner that is paid for. I treat the money as already gone. I am not invested in this to such a level I would be negatively affected in anyway in a full meltdown crash. But Ive got a miner putting out good bitcoins so I like to believe it will be worth some good money. Price increases with difficulty increases only mitigate the lower return for so long. This machine will be unable to be profitable without a significant increase in value beyond $5,000.  I sound much more excited than I should because I love ideas. And Bitcoin is the best I've heard of since the original iPod. It just made sense from the first time it was explained. I also didn't buy apple stock and wouldn't still with the data available at the time.

You mean the difference between the coins (what everyones trading and buying things with) and the platform on which the peer-to-peer transactions are created by cryptographic means (I know its sha-256 created by the NSA? not quite sure if this one or a predecessor) saving all information in a block chain. The protocols that govern it can be edited if 50% of the nodes agree (usually used to stop a fork) the protocol itself is open source and available for viewing for any and all to see. The creator is a Japanese name (I always forget it cause I called him Saki so many times) that is not so much a single person but an unknown group or possibly individual that released it in a white paper that set up the original principles (I have not read it all just exerts...

It's happened at least once. Justice is best served when an illegal act that is repeatable is corrected when first noticed. It is illegal, it just isn't a "big" problem. But they make the mistake of sending a letter with their reasoning behind it. They know why they are being targeted "your spending to much money with x vendor." 
We only need to prove that the same or more money was used by the same style of service provider, that their customers would not be sent the same letter. Of course you need to show the companies have no legal difference other than Bitcoin was involved in a marketing manner.  (Butterfly labs: we sell computers to do one task no one wants to do) Bitcoin is just a marketing term cause that is what the box does. If someone makes an alarm clock that screams "Cows are of the devil" you cannot close a private bank account down because someone bought to much of these stupid items.

So is there a way of searching the chain? Is there a way to archive in the block? Can I basically register with the digital library of the earth in a bit chain block?  Whole books? Novels? Audio files? 
lol.... i suppose you would call that the internet
but seriously as a "these are important" digital archive... but the posibilities are endless if you get x characters for x millibitcoins. Library of Congress all on a server the world has a vested interest in keeping not just one nation? Whats the language support built in? Chinese characters I suppose in unicode? 
Id be interested how this could be used in self regulation versus govenrment regulation. "Search chain" and it looks to see if any part of the added novel is already in the chain so there can be no true plagarism with out linked quotation. We would be saving our culture into a vault that all of the worlds economies may some day have a vested interest in maintaining to some degree.
Id just be interested is all. If each novel cost a small amount of bitcoins to add based on character length then it would go straight to the miners as a fee for breaking the next block. Keeping the miners going as a humanitarian and a monetary increase as they get halved (12 1/2, 6 1/4) but these "human historical record addition fee" would increase as well (Tolstoy in the original Russian .002 btc... payed to the block breaker) 
Websites would then pop up just to read the data out of the chain and interpret it into your language (google translate should be very good by then and could translate Tolstoy to any language) But it would be a time capsule.

As a business owner I would look at your supply chain and see what can be purchased for your business with Bitcoin... many have pointed out the consumer side (GYFT) but if you buy all you office supplies through staples you can get a hefty discount (I thought it was 30% and 3% BTC back at one point but cannot remember) by using GYFT .... you get the instant saving and you have a simple way to put them to work for you.

bitpay is an obvious answer for us.... but we can read about it and decide in one day as individuals.... companies have channels they MUST go through... like it or not its the reality were dealt.... Bitpay is a great service... but it will take time for someone like Wikipedia to vet it.... were I work we have to vet accounts for billing them (as most places) at the end of the month, instead at time of service. I have seen it take 3 months and some come back as insufficient amount of creditors (especially new companies) I would love to use Bitpay.... but it may not have enough of our industries businesses to give references for them to even get a line of credit up to $1500. Every company is different.... but when your dealing with donations there can be a lot more hoops. 3 months to get the okay for one $1500 account ? I can imagine a much larger company would need a little more time for approval than that with an ENTIRE corporate bureaucracy and industry setting precedent..... not just accounting and regional sales approval (two people)
But yes... I do agree there missing out. Im just not getting angry at THEM for the reality we live in...... but I wish we lived in a reality where organizations like that didn't have to work that way..... bitcoin is going to bring us several steps in that direction.

I believe they are missing that there is real world use and it is growing. Every article is about speculation rather than about adding to the depth of the supply chain. Sure there is Lamborghini and Space Flights being sold in Bitcoin but not nails, wood, or raw material. These top chain sales make good news but are not going to be the growth of the system. The growth comes from supply chain vendors at the bottom allowing those top chain items to be bought and sold without the person accepting them having to worry if they can resupply with bitcoin.
Example: Lamborghini sells a car for a bitcoin. As it has no way to pay for parts or services they need to build the next car they have to convert to a local fiat currency. This leads only to speculation cause they need the value to be higher than when it was originally purchased. If they had a vendor who sold them windshield wipers, axels, dashboard components, then they would keep them and pay suppliers with them.
Supply chain is growing, but too much from the top at this time to break away from the speculators. 
China took a bold move to force this change in there country by only allowing citizens and not there financial institutions deal in Bitcoin.

Wouldn't a good outcome be (scarily enough) a precedent setting loss? I know your client would like to win.... but I am putting the specifics of the case aside to ask about the philosophy behind it. If someones case is about the nature of "what is a bitcoin" then the court must set a policy for how it is to be dealt with. Your loss could be a means of appeal until it reaches a high enough court that it becomes an official definition. 
I read a lot about the law but I usually only read supreme court or high appeals court ruling that are deemed precedent. I would be very interested in your thoughts on that process even though I know as a lawyer winning here and now needs to be your focus.

So your saying we are not correcting for the speculation that China would keep the value high? Nothings ACTUALLy changed yet the price is dropping. That screams of speculation. Same as Apple stock changing around the time of an earnings call. Did what Apple do actually change? NO. But now that it was enumerated for people they had a true value to work off and it corrects its stock value (and your correct people will value its stock because they value its stock and no other reason)
You are right. I am not ignoring it. I am saying that price cannot be truly calculated based on peoples thoughts about the currency. The paper would be about changing how people think so we can return to a true definition of price. In the mean time we must live with what we have. The prices are set by what they exchange for because thats what people value it at. But the problem is you go to buy something with your bitcoin and its also based off that and not its true price. causing the price to simply keep parity with the exchange and causing extreme fluctuations. Its a viscous cycle that can be broken.

Your reserve currency is an emergency fund if theres a problem with yours. It slows hyper in/deflation in emergency situations. In the US with no reserve currency (just the hope nobody gets wise and dumps them cause its their reserve currency) you have to have "to big to fail" cause if it fails people get wise to that fact.
China can never control its reserve currency or then its just an internal competing currency. This game of hard to get is to keep them clean if they do make that jump 
CAVEAT: This is my opinion and based on knowledge of that the information is  completely based off of Western news articles that are written with a western bent.

I could be wrong but it looks like the service holds the documents and the block chain holds the timestamp for the document. If I'm not mistaken its only as good as the word of the service provider (I only looked over a little of the site so I could be wrong)

I wouldn't buy gift cards cause it may link the problem to money laundering in there minds. I use to work at a place where we had to copy anyone using gift cards ID cause they were usually for illegal activity. I never had someone go through with a purchase after I asked for there ID but all the cash paying people did. 
One thing I would definitely research and talk to them about is how "mining" is a misnomer" ... they understand banking and any term that has a banking term for it should probably be linked to the real term.

Its a currency, not a stock. Exchanges are a later part of the equation. It needs to be a real supply chain so it can have its own value separate from local fiat currencies. If you can buy things for your business with Bitcoins, you can sell your goods in Bitcoins, if you can't you'll need to use an exchange to turn it into cash. NOT a way to build an economy. US is doing that now buy getting loans from China, and China wants to dump us as the WORLDS reserve currency. Let's give them a reason to look to bitcoin.

S&amp;P shuts down after such a drop.... NYSE would have shut down 10 minutes after opening with these numbers. Its a currency not a stock or commodity. The exchanges should shut down during these type of fear sales. Its basically a bank run that is being mislabeled. But Exchanges are not what they need to be to handle this type of situation. Poor planning. Don't shut down, just institute a 25 minute lag requirement if volatility goes above a certain amount.

Simple fix. Don't speculate!
Use a one year graph.
Take a clear straw and set it on the graph before the senate hearings.... now align it so that all the pre hearing values are in the straw (resize chart appropriately). Now move the straw at along the same angle. BOOM we are still on a growth pattern along the mean. I do not buy above that line... I only sell far above it. Its an easy way to keep a steady head while looking for true growth. NOT perfect.... but it keeps your expectations in check a little more.

Its correct if they added one thing.
Unlike the US, China trades in bitcoin for daily essentials, which is what a currency is for. In the US it is reversed of China. We use it for speculation and very little physical purchasing. In China they said "thats not how good economic platforms are built! and it can tear down existing structures if that collapses" This is a correction of the over speculation and not a black mark on bitcoins potential. Its not developed enough to be traded like the big boys... but it is to be used for its real purpose.
Motley fool completely mischaracterized bitcoin... but it was right..... the US doesn't get it. (and the chinese don't really gamble that much... they take our money at gambling dens cause they are the house .... and the house always wins...... Chinese people also use gambling to get money out of the country.... which is why they gamble so much in Vegas.... they can get there money into chips)

A refitted aircraft carrier would hold how many drones in the space of 1 jet? Different types of drones would need different storage slots, but many would not need complex elevator systems to get them to the runway. You would be able to remove how many support staff? so there living areas are smaller. Storage for food and human supplies drops drastically. How many crew you really need? Keep witting away the human numbers and your ship can hold an invasion force of incredible effectiveness. Automated security systems with kinnect type identification or shot on site (visitors are not welcome to the Bitcoin navy!) Medical staff drops as all you need is a fraction of the original maintenance men.

This kind of thing has to be slowed. Boycotts are fine once you have 10% of the target market behind you. But we have something like .1% in real sales for larger established non-bitcoin centric business. 
Those who wish to boycott tend to be those who tout Free Market as their justification.

I think my two wallet system would work. It would require the person who started it to keep there "bit right" wallet number (and I'm sure theres a name better than this I just had to come up with something to distinguish it form the rest of the "copyright" "wallet" terms we'd be using.) but the wallet would be emptied as payment at the end of the services upload process. It would be payment but it would not be left in the wallet. 
I suppose you would have to have the final line link to a wallet you had a password for so you could open it and prove you were the user without your personal information being on the chain. (Hi, I'm joe smith... heres the idea and all my personal information so you can contact me when you want to use this idea)
Also contracts allowing use can be made by appending some kind of identifier to it 
Example: Microsoft want to use your idea... they would attach there contractual wallet information to the "bit right" wallet with the patent and have proof they have rights to its use. ONLY the wallet owner could send that information out of there wallet so even if people just sent money to the wallet the script would know it was never approved.

yes... i agree they are throwing away a chance to receive a lot of donations. But truly can you blame them? Most of us have ways of sending them cash and they know that. The fact we are reading this sub reddit says we to some degree believe in bitcoin so we have a bias that large corporations (or large non-profits) cannot afford to have. They have a great deal at stake to keep to sound investing and not be involved in non government backed funds. Imagine if they started taking diamonds? There would be a lot more headaches than the diamonds are worth.
The key here is that there suppliers are small nimbler companies that can do bitcoin with something as simple as a key staffer understanding the value the way we do. (Virgin Galactic anyone?) If we get the supply chain to first accept and then demand bitcoin we will win. It is alot easier to change the direction of a speedboat than an ocean liner... but neither can be unaffected by the tide. Trying to do top down acceptance is an idea many of the bitcoin community find abhorrent. While it does not have its merits, acceptance in a companies supply chain is a tidal shift they will need to correct for... or be sunk by. Would Wikipedia do fine never taking bitcoin? Yes.... will they be better off if they did? Yes..... should we begrudge them not accepting our donations? I say no. They have our reasons and some day we will make it crystal clear why they should have changed direction sooner. There supply chain is how we get them.

I would use the money to figure out the true value of bitcoin. Its a real number and can be calculated. 21 million bitcoins is all there will ever be. Therefore every bitcoin in existence must be able to purchase all the raw material of earth. If we find the cheapest raw material in the world that is usable we set it at .00000001 btc per its smallest usable unit. This would create its real value and we could detach completely from it being based on speculation. I couldn't really do it on my own but would need a lot of minds working on the problem and solving the issue. I would use the bitcoin to get a website and the ball rolling.

You are right. RICO requires two racketeering charges, but it sound's sexier on Reddit.

At this point a realistic outcome is a bunch of early adopters (and probably many more late buy-ins with lots of cash to burn) make a lot of money and true believers and smaller investors get left holding a currency no one will take cause of over speculation and volatility. Following a small craze the next 5 months, when there is no real trade use and the Black Friday sales numbers are long forgotten, a few Lamborghini got sold and a few really flashy houses.  But since there is no bit-coin accepting supply chain to producers... it never reaches its promising potential and is broken by the repatriation of Bitcoin into our respective fiat currencies. It will see some use for actual trading but it will sink below the pre-silk road prices. Silk road was after all the primary real world application of bitcoin besides wealth creation by speculators (like myself)

I crunched the numbers awhile back. There are 21 million Bitcoins that are in the system (different than in circulation... like a bank having money that they just can't lend but its on account) and 3.4 trillion in US dollars used for Chinas reserves. So if China reduced the dollar to 10% of its reserve currency holdings over the next ten years and 50% of that going into bitcoin you would see 1.5 trillion dollar market cap... each bitcoin would be worth 71,000 dollars per bitcoin. Food for thought! Thats assuming this hasn't been there plan all along and the Bitcoin only gets 50% of the Chinese reserve currency as it stands

Myself? I keep very little in bit coins right now. I have traded some out to buy books (knowledge to me is where I invest) but at the moment there are not a lot of durable goods that can be purchased cause of the shallow supply chain. 
Because of the top limit of 21 million that should equate to the whole world can be bought for 21 million bit coins. You would need to find the cheapest single raw material and set it at .00000001  per its smallest usable unit. That would give you the TRUE price of bitcoin. A lot of work but a reasonable way to set real values.
It sounds crazy cause at this time the work load of one person to do it is crazy. I imagine it would take a year or two just to come up with what those values would be for raw materials, but every raw material would need to be set.

We started in the wrong direction. Bank notes were not offered on exchanges for years and years till they became accepted. Grow it like any real world currency. But I agree.. it gave us much needed publicity. Now we need to speak about the dangers of speculation and how Bitcoin represents a sub economy that is in real goods and services. Zynga dollars and there ilk stick around cause you can buy things with them (a new field in farmville and the tractor to plow) till bitcoin can buy real tractors and plows this speculation is more for publicity (which is good till now and bad on days like today) than for really growing it as a currency of exchange between real people.

I know there still profitable and will be for some time. But human psychology plays in and I think a lot of people will run mining calculators showing a loss. I plan to cash in by buying as many low level rigs when psychology over logic kicks in. I have a goal for bitcoin and in 2 years those 5 Gh's will be worthless but until then I plan to mine them regardless of its "exchange" rate value.
Your right... its stupid to stop mining cause its the bitcoin you want not the exchange rate at time of mining. Thats why people are selling without using that money to buy back in with better equipment..... but a lot sell to get the money for better equipment.
I hope to do well buying on peoples inability to think longterm. Many bitcoin miners do think long term (why they gravitated toward mining earlier on).... so its hard to judge how many are more of your standard people.

They are faster... and that is part of my concern. As I talk to people in person they all seem to think EVERY miner thats not theres gets replaced with a 600 Gh/s one. I think the number of 5 Gh/s ones in the system will disappear cause at current rates its not worth it. Even if the price rebounds the difficulty/cost ratio would be unable to over come the time they spent not mining... removing hundreds of ~5 Gh/s units from the overall system... maybe a net loss over all reducing the mean increase of the difficulty numbers. (instead of every 8 days it would sit at a difficulty for a month till moors law reset the over all expansion)

This is true. We set our price based on the scarcity of rooms in our market. Higher if there are less rooms available, lower if there are a lot of them available. MUCH MUCH higher if the ONLY ones available. (not unusual for them to reach twice their rate if we are the last few left) 
We are not going to set the rate based on hotels though. But a price of a hotel is based on the cost of raw materials to run it (soap, breakfast items, staffing costs, linens, pool chemicals)
Take one of those items and break it down and you will find that it gets more complicated. Pool chemicals for example: Chlorine is the base chemical, but it has to be turned into something useful... like sodium hypochlorite. The cost of chlorine is nothing do to its abundance. But changing it to sodium hypochlorite requires raw material of labor and knowledge and infrastructure to do so. Lets say that costs $2 per litre for all that. It take one litre per day to keep the pool clean. (I do not clean the pool so I don't know that exact number) so in a hundred room hotel .02 cents is the cost to rent that room.... add them all up and the average room night costs $50 to have available per night. You have a new commodity! Now you find the scarcity of them (we have 100 of the 10,000 in this market in this scenario) so we price it to sell and make a profit for our owners as well. 
we only need to know the values of the raw materials (which are finite) that are usable on a set day in the future.

Buy cards for places you buy supplies and you have a pre-paid account with a vendor you already do business with. (buy all your office supplies from staples? Just convert at a good time to those $100 gift cards and never have to worry... Im sure you can figure out your yearly expenditures and just buy up to that amount in gift cards)

Love the idea! I think churches and non-profits should embrace Bitcoin for these very reasons. I think its ability to circumvent the entirety of the banking system makes it best for mission boards to send instant needs to people where there is a bitcoin comerce.
EXAMPLE: Your a missionary in China and your engine blows on the car. You go to a bitcoin accepting mechanic and send there wallet number to your mission board. The mission board pays them and you go on doing your true mission.
Right now that same scenario involves bank transfers and waiting periods with banking fees. I remember many missionaries mentioning in there letters several times in a row even though our church sent almost half the cost of the engine repair.

It is to a large part yes! But its truly a small aspect that in order for that to become a reality I think acceptance by someone like paypal will increase the over all availability to bitcoin and give a nudge to look at it. Bitcoin is only worth something if used... wether the user understands or is using bitcoin to its full potential is irrelevant, as long as they use! Right now people pay ridiculous fees for buying bit coins in person, on exchanges, into Linden Dollars&gt;LiteCoins&gt;Bitcoins .... the list of ways people ares till being charged fees now is ridiculous. (Transfer between certain wallets on sites? .001 isn't a lot of money now... but imagine if the price increased a thousand times? Every transaction you did with this .001 fee is now $1,000!) Paypal fees have never been a couple bucks before.... but inflation means those fees are never going to have me going, "I shouldn't have payed that 20 cent fee three years ago. Now I can't buy a house." 
My Dad was 55 at the time he showed me Paypal which wasn't even accepted directly by ebay at the time! Not everyone finds out about things as early adopters. Paypal is a financial name people trust but isn't a bank. It would be good with or without the fees. The community would be split on the fees but all ecstatic about the increase of use!

Um... sue? Seriously there is evidence enough that the banks are  doing a RICo style attack on Bitcoin service providers. Oh the banks may be okay with Bitcoin, but they won't let you make significant purchases with your money and it looks co-ordinated. It is a institutionalized boycott. (We see you buy a lot of gas through Citgo... cease using this company or we cannot do business)
This is highly illegal as they bank cannot ask you to stop frequenting a business (please say they have a business model?)
I would contact the ACLU (not a fan of most they do... but this is a case they specialize in) 
If the bank sent you a letter saying "Do not send money to the Republican Party" "Do not continue to purchase BET from your local cable provider" the Federal Government would step in and shut it down.
Im pretty sure the commerce clause applies. You are purchasing a legal service from these places. They are asking you not to. IF your bank has a financial planning department, what is to stop them from saying "we have one and your using Scottstrade... stop or we will not be able to do business"
Any evidence that the banks discussed this between each other AUTOMATICALLY makes it a RICO case.

 Forbes work in the Goldwater Republican circles was extensive at one point and he still has great deal of editorial control. He was shilling for a big conference group that targeted middle class tea-party and conservative religious groups. They were really selling you day trading classes with some fancy "candlestick charts are so easy to read you can't loose" sales pitch. But Forbes spoke about the need to diversify your holdings into other currencies and gold. His libertarian leanings really speak to the reason I think Forbes magazine (I don't believe they own it any more as a family but I think he retains editorial control with board overide?) is pushing so hard for something that really seems like slowing down and more vetting wouldn't have harmed them. I mean, most people never heard of it till Forbes made it hard to ignore. Then the New York Times 2 articles made a lot of people start talking. (I work where a lot of upper level business people are and they started talking about it the day the 2nd article hit... and all their talking points came from the New York Times article)
Suffice to say. If Forbes himself didn't push for it, then his hiring practices of more Austrian and Libertarian minded staff back in the day created an environment where it would propagate quicker.

I reverse my view on services after more research (and thought) services are still based on raw material (mostly man power) so the scarcity of specialized man power is a services price. So a quantifier would be used to estimate this (Off the hip Example: for every one thousand people .0002% have the skills to create a masterpiece level "service" like a rembrandt... .004% can create a Warhol.... .01 can create a Thomas Kinkade and 10% can create a viral meme{all numbers are fictitious but findable through statistics} so you add a .5% to the value of Human resources for artistic endeavor)

I would disagree on the basis that these banks are canceling peoples accounts (which they sign a contract to have) for no reason more than doing business with a company (that possibly a purchase could be...yada yada yada the second part is for non contract, so we do not need to twist the meaning of a sale to say its a contract) that has every right to do the business that it does, and it is legal. I see your escrow argument and agree that it would be easier if the bank withheld something from the account holder, but all the evidence points to them canceling the account and returning the money to them. The reason I think this has a case is simply that the bank did not have any reasonable expectation that something illegal was going on, nor did they allude to it in the letter that was sent (at least the one I read, I doubt they were all the same in there explanation) but the argument of MMO's and Paypal is accurate as well, what is reasonable for a bank to decline a transaction, but more importantly what is the justification for canceling a customers account for doing "too much" business with someone they continue to process payments to. Either the individual is being restricted in purchasing more than they should from any one company, or the company is being denied sales from the banks former account holder.
My legal knowledge of tort is very inadequate. But this seems to have a disconnect that I cannot work out as being legal. It is definitely a poor business practice, but I cannot put it down as illegal. Until a lawyer, that specializes in whatever part of the law this is, is consulted; I feel that a possibly illegal act could become an accepted norm and allowed to exist because there is proof it had existed and nothing was done about it. (I have heard of it happening but I will say right now I have no proof there is a legal doctrine guiding a "every body has done it for years, its industry standard" defense except grandfather clauses...but that would definitely NOT apply here)

I am not a lawyer, I have only take Constitutional law and not tort or criminal, I cannot offer legal advice and my first and for most suggestion would be for people who had their bank accounts closed to seek legal counsel. I am genuine in my attempt to solve this issue before it becomes more wide spread. I in no way intended to offend anyone yesterday, but it is clear that I did. It is also clear my knowledge of the law is so limited that finding what may or may not work is beyond my ability. I know there ARE laws that deal with this. I just do not know what they are. I want to personally apologize to everyone I wronged by not hearing their full complaints out. I think some things have "similarities" but are in no way the same. This does not mean I do not have ideas of where we may look. 
Tort law is an area I have NO knowledge of, but I found this through Wikipedia (I'm trying to catch up and it was easier than finding a copy of Black's Law Dictionary) I think it has promise, but now that there are lawyers on the forum, I would like to ask what they think.

Your right. I know it is known but isn't properly categorized. (A university doesn't make those exceptions without proof of problem... they did... so without having to share my entire mental evaluation history, i said "unknown" and shared the story. Hearing voices is being human to. But if it gets beyond a certain level, its schizophrenia (or similar). Yes.... I am human... yet... lazy proofreading is human. What I had was recognized by a psychological assessment to require I receive a special waver. ... so it's more than "I'm just another human" 
I'm sorry you took offense for me trying to explain myself. I do care about grammar and how poor grammar forces the reader to work harder. And if forces a well educated reader to question the quality of information. Yes every human can find faults in others and fail to see the fault in themselves. That is true. Not every person can request a test not be counted because the grammatical errors changed the meaning of the words and that "the answer" could only be the "closest answer" 
I doubt the average user would care, or apologize, when corrected. I certainly think that the average user would also not share such a story that paints them as "defective" in the minds of humanity. I have a problem. I manage it, but Reddit does not allow me to keep up and still manage it well, by its very nature.
I would not share if I did not think it would help me to apologize for the bad grammar. Unless I was a troll. Which we are all trolls truly, the difference if we are on purpose, or out of naivety.

I think that peoples interest in it is related. But there were other letters here and there. It's impossible to tell how wide spread it is. No ones jumping on here saying "happened to me!" (trolls will soon but I expect few legit ones) So this thread is helping in judge a way to go forward. I hope anyone who has keeps contact with others. Some people were legitimately cut off. Some were mistakes. But only ONE needs to be a purposeful refusal for financial services, based on the purchase of legitimate goods and services. And the refusal must be provable that other letters were not sent out based on the same criteria to other bank customers about other companies (which I highly doubt)
People can still sue for the legal departments not doing due diligence before sending the letters, especially stock holders, as they have an expectation of due diligence being done with their money. {But that is a new idea I need a lot of research and rehashing in my head before I really put it out their)

They still exist and can be brought online later... but theres an effective time period where people just won't use them (there being shipped to a new owner as the old owner just wanted his money back) 
Because of the number of people on the system, there will be a lot of these type transactions. As one is completed someone else will have decided to do the same somewhere else in the world. So it will lower the hash rate the more people who decide to sell them. In a few weeks when people STOP selling them and decide to keep running them then the system returns to its previous hash rate. Im wondering if we feel that percentage is high enough to drastically reduce the difficult jump were all staring at when 300's and 600's start shipping (which won't ship all day one... so I think people are exaggerating those increases)

You have a good point. I was using it as an example of ONE of the things banks have a 100% accurate term for (which mine may not have been) and we use a term that conflicts cause they have a different meaning. I would spend some research time just finding the terms that will confuse them and correcting the misnomers right at the top. I had a nice conversation about "reserve currency concerns" with a  Chinese business owner a little while back and we never had to say bitcoin cause it was more about the idea around it. If i had ever said bitcoin they would have stopped the whole conversation, but they understand "non-centralized reserve currency" and that conversation was very profitable.

I would suggest having a flat Bitcoin rate. We need people to think of it more like an independent currency not fluctuating to the whims of the current fiat currencies. Does anyone remember when books had a USD and Canadian price on them? Why? Cause they had completely different values in the two countries. I bought a bunch of books on a trip to Canada one time cause there exchange rate dropped the books well below USD prices. Everyone on the school trip thought I was crazy for spending more money to buy a book in another country. I got the same exact copies I would have gotten, but basically got 2 or 3 free books and spent a little less. If we think of Bitcoin as a new way of quoting a price in USD we are loosing! A bitcoin has a yet undetermined value that will someday become evident and pegging it to the dollar will slow down that process.

I agree! I have a miner I just got... but the whole speculative bubble had to crash. It's good for Bitcoin. If it kept going like this it would face the need for a central bank like structure to keep it from correcting as the difference between consumers and savers would never balance.

Great summary, from the look of the categories of discussion I say the Dutch got a balanced introduction to Bitcoin. Three articles is a good bit space devoted to this.

Never mind.. China's government just banned banks from use of bitcoin and it came down hard. It will come back.... but its funny the only nation that really USES the coin just shook the market with a lukewarm reception of "DON'T JUMP ON YET!"
Bitcoin is pure speculation in the US till there is a fully fledged commerce and infrastructure for such. Then it wouldn't have jumped a beat if it had good roots.
I think it will be back up by Friday barring any more reversals on the "I thought things were going well in this area?" blindsides.  Bitcoin is a gamble more than an investment till producers give it real value. Not just exchange traders.

Get one person in the door who buys in cash but came because of Bitcoin... its all the same to your bosses.

These problems exist only cause of speculation and not because of a fundamental flaw in bitcoin.
If the Bitcoin supply chain depth were deeper there would be no need to worry about volatility.
If a vendor can always buy supplies and services under neath them in the supply chain they would not need to ever turn bitcoin into local currency. At this time its usually only for a higher level retail type service. 
While I applaud them noticing the problem the community needs to focus on fixing the supply chain depth issue by getting lower level suppliers to accept.
Example: I buy a house with bit coins. The builder uses those bit coins to pay its workers and to buy supplies from a local lumber yard. The lumber yard uses the bitcoin to pay there lumbering company and suppliers who also accept it. The company that sells the nails takes those bit coins to buy raw materials. The raw material miner just bought a house with his bit coins.
The volatility is caused because we all think "How do I turn it into my local currency"

They do ask if you have the card... if you say no they send you to the "phone purchase" line regardless of why you don't have it.... so clarifying that they have two departments... one asks and sends you to the non-asking line if they don't like your answer

I posted this to a similar question... but the same principle applies. (Bitpay is a great option... but here is a slightly different way of looking at it)

Tax is not theft. Our government is stealing from us and hiding behind calling it taxes. If someone provides you a service and you use it with no intention of paying them is that not also theft? Certain taxes are simply paying for a service that your using and are good and healthy in any economy. Being charged for any and all services? Paying for services you have no access to? yes.... many taxes are theft. Even Ayn Rand said we needed some government to protect property rights and extremely basic needs of society that individuals would not take care of on there own.

Stabliization comes once it is pegged to raw materials and real commodities. We don't have it and few are moving toward getting that. At some point the community will need to step up and demand it. Right now I am floating how that conversation will need to take shape. 
I won't convince you today, but since you read it you have that in your brain and some day I hope it will come to the forefront when it has to happen.
E-mail is killing the post office.... when it came out the post office didn't really care. Now they are scrambling to stay viable. (not just because of e-mail but disregarding UPS and FEDEX cause packages were not their bread and butter, advertisement mailers and letters were) They waited till there "we'll always have letters" safety net fell apart. 
I just want to find the true safety net for bitcoin a little sooner by spreading the ideas.
