Congratulations on not being an active member of society. Evading tax is as UN-American as it gets. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:30:52
Yes. I enjoy clean running water. An infrastructure of utilities and services at my disposal. Public safety. Public schools. Social Security. Yes I’m just happy as a clam here on the plantation. By not paying taxes you are taking advantage of people who do.  I know illegal immigrants who pay tax and it seems to me they are more American and definitely more deserving of citizenship than you

Just had this issue myself. The transaction creates a new address for the balance of your exchange. I had to roll the dice and just confirm it. Fortunately it was not a loss on my end and the balance was in my Ledger with the new address upon confirmation. Needless to say I’m looking for a new hardware wallet

It’s legit

If you wait a year you drastically reduce the amount. 15% after a year

Go to ViaBTC.com and use their transaction accelerator feature. Copy the transaction ID into the field and submit at exactly the top of the hour ie: 0800 0900 etc. I suggest having the info on deck and ready to submit a minute before. When the clock changes hit submit. They only accept 100 transactions per hour. I just utilized this a few hours ago on a transaction that was pending for over 50 hours. It was cleared within 30 minutes. And it is at no cost to you

So it’s the Herbalife of taxation? GTFO with this

Exactly. That's why I believe this is just a bump in the road.

Stock? 
You're doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:20:08
Interesting point. 
Purely speculation at this point. 
Not sure how they'd manage to regulate running a GPU to play a math game. Which is all mining is.
Oh wait they're communist.

I don't see the correlation.  Is that a subreddit that also talks harshly about r/Bitcoin? 
If not let's make r/Airplane_food 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:39:55
What would be the point of having that much control. You would essentially be buying yourself out of the market
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:59:06
I couldn't find anything on their website for iOS either. Although I wouldn't want to keep an iOS wallet anyway. 
Edit: except for the authenticator app
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:09:36
Airplane food then? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:28:42
I'll send you my address and I'll take one off your hands
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:01:23
Just giving you a hard time. I figured as much
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:25:02
Fucking SODL!!! I just spit coffee everywhere. Thank you for the laugh
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:07:46
Equivalent in usd value or amount of coins?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:34:31
I wasn't sure. I wasn't around for the first hard fork
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:08:31
I think I'm secure. I transfer everything off of the exchange into a ledger nano

Look up dollar cost averaging. Or pretend anyone here knows when it will plummet just in time for you to buy before it goes "to the moon" as they say
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:56:51
I fear that message would be devastating to my current holdings. Alas, it would only encourage me to acquire more. 
I believe wholeheartedly if we can stabilize cryptocurrency prices and people utilize it as a form of exchange instead of an investment, this will be the way we transact and financially interact worldwide.

Agreed. But the announcement alone will bring BTC to the masses and that's exactly what we need. It's still a niche market.
