Does the user manual warn about preinitialized wallets though? All they would have to do is attach a paper on top of the box indicating the seed to use. Some might fall for it. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:43:54
No. At most just see your addresses but can't steal.

Two newbs during a fall and someone about to buy the dip

No, I meant they would still install proper firmware like normal but use the words attached to packaging thinking it is the proper way to initialize. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:37:58
Ah, might help, but I can still imagine users installing firmware then using the list of words the paper fake instructed. You might have to specifically mention that words MUST come from the device itself and shouldn't be initialized using words that someone gave the user even if they claim to come from Satoshilabs. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:52:37
No, just run new version. It can only happen while old version is running. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:45:54
Can't just be copy and pasted though. It's built for segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:28:21
I'd much rather 250,000 bits over 0.25 BTC! ;) 
ACK.

This bug has had me thinking about bitcoin and potential failures of code's intent. This one seems to be of the type that is a failure of it's P2P network. Another bug could be a failure of consensus. In theory couldn't nodes be crashing everywhere and blocks would eventually continue once the problem was debugged? Whereas a consensus failure seems more risky with two blockchains. Interestingly bitcoin has a more mono culture for software and bitcoincash by having multiples clients could be more prone to consensus failures while being more resistant to network attacks.

Boot into TAILS and use Electrum with it. You can write down the seed to back it up. No digital record needs to be stored and everything is wiped off the computer when you reboot. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:44:52
Storing the words digitally ruins the separation of the private keys from computers. Seeds should be offline ideally and only entered on a hardware wallet.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:33:44
It would probably be safer to just divide the list in half yourself than use software that will see the seed. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:08:47
Have live block hashes pop up would be a cool way to time stamp the feed. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:36:21
Don't block explorer sites have an API for block hashes and you poll it every so often? I don't know web development.
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:01:44
Absolutely correct. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:20:42
Hardware wallet seeds shouldn't ever go on a computer. Only on the device. Too many things can go wrong and compromise the seed. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:44:57
When setting them up you write down a set of words on paper. This allows you to reprogram the device back to same keys. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:04:38
If more than 51 percent of miners would signal UASF instead of NYA we can be sure the original chain beats them all. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:52:30
The words are the backup. No digital copies are needed.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:44:16
You mentioning music made me think of bitlisten.com/bitbonkers.com imagery and sounds behind the chart.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:29:46
You could also get the headers from others sites if you wanted
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:23:08
It's on the right
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:40:29
The seed is the recovery. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:34:32
In advanced tab you wipe or erase the device and then recovery should show up after. Just make sure you have the seed before you erase it. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:05:09
Just think of it as a tax on humanity for not being able to trust each other. lol. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:03:45
True but the company is trading assets that are claimed to be fraudulent. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:15:22
Magic internet money. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:42:30
Brilliant way of putting it. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:53:26
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:01:17
also lying. I'll guess we'll have to pick. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:41:43
If the firmware was installed, after wiping, the firmware remains and doesn't need to be installed again. It sounds like you have set it up correctly. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:06:17
Perhaps just a nice short statement people like and agree with. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:56:49
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:27:13
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:25:09
Another fascinating quote is 30:55 ish when talking about decentralization and rise of the Medici 
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:01:54
It sounds like you did it correct. To test it and ease your mind, you could wipe it and try restoring the words on the Trezor. The receive addresses before wiping and after restoring should be the same. Just make sure that you never put the words on a computer file or type them out unless prompted by the Trezor itself. The Trezor asks in random order so the computer never learns the order of words.

Now, don't fuck it up by supporting Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:12:26
But muh coffee...oh. 
Looks cool. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:53:36
Duplicated everywhere yet scarcity guaranteed?
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:32:55
wrong address
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:04:37
In the software it still shows 0.3 segwit for user agent?
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:35:31
Until core thinks it's locked BIP91 is essentially an agreement by miners to orphan non-segwit blocks. Actual guarantee would be about 3 weeks from now when a whole 2 week difficulty period signals 95% or more for segwit. Until that date miners could in theory start building on non-segwit blocks. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:25:44
The event...dun dun dun... Exciting times. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:42:51
They just mined a segwit block. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:31:06
I'd bet they will continue again, probably forgot to update a computer. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:57:10
We are in the first few steps but at least the machine is going. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:15:12
Is UASF a safe way to make to make sure the miners can't back out before core locks it in?
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:36:20
Would another UASF that enforces segwit based on the block height that BIP91 voted on rather than Aug 1 be useful?
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:45:27
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:09:34
I've wondered if these type of soft forks make bitcoin susceptible to dangerous altering but I think the one thing that makes this even possible is that almost everyone wants segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:47:24
 seems to be something similar. Are there plans to use it for back end?
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:59:19
UASF: "Let's fire ViaBTC" 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:24:03
I guess an advantage of 24 words is the ability to split the seed into two parts of 12 words each and store separately so both have to stolen.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:58:11
A 24 word seed would be easiest as you could have two different people who do not know each other to create 12 words each. You obviously wouldn't mention other parts exist or how you coded the words. A passphrase like Trezor does would make it even more secure in case they somehow collude to combine words.  
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:58:54
store.bitcoin.com has trezor.
