Ask blockchain.info. I asked them many times, but they think that polishing their iOS app over and over again is more important.

I call BS. I asked customer support for bitcoin support, and they said they would pass my request on.

So you let others write the code and you take the money? Or will developers get their share?

Sorry but this is _absolutely_ not true. The IDE is _much_ better than any IDE you can use to develop for Android. Android Studio, Eclipse or NetBeans don't even come _near_ Visual Studio. Furthermore, the API for Windows Phone is lightyears ahead of Android. You don't have to deal with the whole activity lifecycle nonsense, you've got _extremely_ easy async access through async/await, you have very clean and easy to use event handlers, data binding through MVVM, LINQ in C# to filter through data, and the list goes on and on. Also, the Windows Phone emulator is lightyears ahead of all emulators the Android platforms has to offer, mostly on performance.


- Live tiles that show you useful data live on your start screen
- Superior social media integration through the people hub


That's just anecdotal. Windows Phone runs very smooth, even on the devices with the lowest specs. Can't say the same about Android.

It's nice if YOU come to that conclusion by doing your research, but the thing is that other people around you will have to realize it as well for you to make a profit.

It's pretty simple: because most people didn't buy _before_ the bubble, but _during_ the bubble. A 200% increase is only nice for those who bought when the price was still $150, not for those who bought when the price was $1100.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:28:00
Can anyone ELI5 if/how this can cause the price to rise? As far as I understand, they're trading in their own pool, and arbitrage is not possible.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:03:06
Smells like bullshit. As if there are millions of people waiting in line to buy a bitcoin miner... I can't imagine there were more than 1000 people. That's not nearly enough to bring down a large website.

I think it doesn't matter what they think about Bitcoin. In the end, knowingly using Bitcoin is not the destination for Bitcoin. Everyone will be using Bitcoin without knowing it one day. It's just the protocol for money.

Let me provide a quick translation/summary:
- The 3 largest Dutch banks (ING, ABN Amro, Rabobank) are investigating the technology behind Bitcoin for their payments systems.
- What is Bitcoin? It's peer-to-peer money that is checked by computers instead of by the bank.
- Why are banks interested? It could make payments much faster and cheaper. The banks are taking a serious look at it but haven't decided whether they are going to use it.
- Would anything change for consumers? No, it will be faster and cheaper, but everything would stay the same. Consumers won't be paying in Bitcoin.
- How about all the bitcoin scandals? A lot of Bitcoin companies had a bad security. Bitcoin is also in use in the criminal circuit. There are some important distinctions: there's the currency Bitcoin, there are companies that make money with Bitcoin (some of them had a bad security, but that has nothing to do with the currency) and there's the technology behind Bitcoin (in which people like Richard Branson and big Dutch banks are interested).
- The banks warn that it must be 100% secure before it will be used.
- The DNB (dutch central bank?) is critical about Bitcoin but sees merit in the technology behind it. They appreciate the fact that banks are investigating Bitcoin and have no concerns with it.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:20:35
Just wait, they will come back. Sometimes they have a service outage. I don't think it's a scam, the business model can really work and the earnings they report seem in line with the volatility and price differences on that day.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:17:04
It's actually pretty cheap, but it's not intended for consumers; it's aimed towards business. SXSW tickets cost ~$1000.

It hasn't been update for almost a year and it doesnt even work. As soon as I try to pair my wallet, it crashes. Also, it doesnt support 2 FA.

Erhh.. What?
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:46:11
Awesome! To be honest I missed the De Jager news and the bitcoin congres news. Guess the news was a bit lost in all the Bitcoin2014 voilence which was also in Amsterdam around that time =)
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:56:08
It hasn't really started yet. Today there were a few invite-only events. The big happening will start tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:10:16
They've added it pretty fast! On February 17th they wrote this in an email to me:


So in one month time, they added it to the roadmap and developed it.
But this is VERY nice! I want to support bitcoin for my web project because the credit card margin is killing me, so I'd love to try this. Balanced sounds really nice as well, but unlike Stripe they don't accept customers from the Netherlands.

We've got a bidder who offers 0.25 BTC for them. She can create new paintings for the same price (that will look the same or different, based on what you want), or for a different price if you want something else (a 1-piece, 3-piece or even 4-piece is also possible).

I fully agree with you OP. Windows Phone need a good bitcoin wallet as well, it's a shame blockchain just ignores the platform. There is one bitcoin wallet app, but it sucks. It hasn't been update for almost a year and it doesnt even work. As soon as I try to pair my wallet, it crashes. Also, it doesnt support 2 FA.

Bitcoin Can? That's not a wallet is it? If you want a trading app I can highly recommend my own app :) 
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:48:49


This isn't correct. Thuisbezorgd is a site that allows you to order at thousands of restaurants in the Netherlands. It's by far the best use of bitcoin when you're in the Netherlands; no matter where you live, there's always a restaurant in the neighborhood that takes bitcoin through thuisbezorgd. It's not like thuisbezorgd is a restaurant by itself.
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:03:16
How does this work though? Where does the ATM store the bills? Isn't it very easy to steal the ATM for the cash that's inside?
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:32:21
I see these kind of posts just as some kind of way to convince the big companies (like blockchain.info) with too much money to build it. Blockchain could easily do it, and that would be much better because I don't really trust third-party apps.
Blockchain fixed things that were requested by before, they might do it again. Honestly, they don't have a really good reason _not_ to develop a WP app. All those resources they put into iOS dev could have been put in WP dev. Microsoft will allow their app, they will make a lot of people happy.
So that's that, it's not aimed at you our me, but at the big guys out there :)


At least Android has the userbase to compensate for it :(
@_date: 2014-04-12 14:28:33
Yes, it would definitely be allowed. Microsoft isn't being as dickish as Apple about bitcoin. In fact I have a full-featured bitcoin trading app in the Windows Phone Store:

It sucks. It hasn't been update for almost a year and it doesnt even work. As soon as I try to pair my wallet, it crashes. Also, it doesnt support 2 FA.

Not really true, that is font-dependent. The USD Unicode number just refers to "a" USD symbol, it doesn't specify if it should have one or two stripes.

Well, let me know if you have any feedback that you'd like to share. The app is used a lot, but not many people are actually trading.
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:15:36


That's not true. There may be an 11% inflation, but most of the coins are hoarded. The order books are very tin. Even a fraction of that 11% would be enough to bring Bitcoin to $10 if they would all be dumped in a short timeframe.
Also: typical how my comment got downvoted for not taking part in the whole Bitcoin circlejerk for once. Some people here really live in their own worlds... Yes, compared to a year ago Bitcoin is still up, but most of the people bought AFTER or during the bubble and lost a lot of their moneys. Bitcoin is a terrible store of value for everyone who's looking to buy some right now.

- Hotels: with AirBnB the need for hotels is getting smaller and smaller.
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:54:08
Ah, I get your point. Good point.
It's mostly because the majority of the people here don't know how to develop software. I'm a software dev and I'd like to do it, it's a nice business opportunity for me as well (in fact I already created one of the highest rated bitcoin apps for WP8: 
The only problem I'm facing is that Windows Phone users just aren't willing to pay for anything. I usually put hundreds of hours into my app, but as soon as I charge a single penny, they will just stop using my app (and sometimes give it a 1-star rating). Lot's of people who use my app _every single day_ decided not to purchase any credits to trade, simply 'because it costs money'.

@_date: 2014-07-26 20:30:46
Don't you guys think this is a genuine problem? I see lots of new places accepting Bitcoin but I don't feel like more people have been attracted towards _using_ Bitcoin. I think the majority of the people just don't see the benefit (and to be honest, in the Netherlands there barely is a benefit because we have great payment systems).
@_date: 2014-08-02 12:51:01
But U+0E3F will still be refering to "Thai currency symbol Baht" instead of "Bitcoin" which is something totally different. So I don't agree that we should just keep using the Thai currency symbol. Not even when it would be rendered with 2 stripes.
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:54:43
Exactly. Plus, 'pinnen' will work with NFC soon as well, so aside from being cheap it will also be a very streamlined and easy process for the consumer. Arguably easier than Bitcoin.

Apps were also possible before smartphones. They were usually little Java files that you had to manually install on your phone. The lack of a app store doesn't mean that it's not possible, the distribution is just more difficult.

Allowed: probably. Will I? No. I want my customers to make the call and allow them to have their competitive advantage.
One of the apps I worked on now has a first version live:  (hope you can see it from outside of the Netherlands). They're doing really good work here in the Netherlands, providing customers with an easy way to buy bitcoins (and store them safely).
It's safe to say though (from customers I've worked with in the past) that I've got experience with Wallet and Merchant apps!

Yea great, but you don't need any companies to buy and sell marijuana. If you want Bitcoin to be big, you need to be able to:
1) purchase stuff with it at companies (both online and offline). The government can forbid them to accept bitcoin.
2) Exchange fiat from and to Bitcoin. Sure, you can use localbitcoin, but that won't draw in the large majority of the people. In order to get them in you need to make it easy: provide ATMs, online exchanges, etc. The government can easily forbid both of those and force banks to cooperate with them.
So the government has lots of power to prevent Bitcoin from becoming big. You are right that they can't fully ban it, but in that case it will always be and stay small, it will only be a handful of people exchanges bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:02:33
How so?
@_date: 2015-11-15 22:58:39
Thanks for that, but I don't necessarily need to get paid in Bitcoin or anything, plus there are a lot more bitcoiners here :-)
@_date: 2015-03-12 14:28:25
It will stop any legitimate company from existing, leaving you with shady anonymous services (that usually turn out to be a scam)... So yea, the government can basically outlaw it.

1) When I sent my invoice I decided the BTC amount they had to pay. When I received the payment 2 weeks later it dropped in price so I just hoarded the coins. Still have them. Very bad decision, because I still have to pay 52% income tax over the EUR value they had when I sent my invoice (BTC price dropped 60% since...). Next time I would probably just send the invoice with a USD/EUR amount and use a service to convert any BTC to EUR.

I googled 'lighthouse' and found many, many things. What are you refering to?

Bitcoin: 10% inflation.
Fiat: 2% inflation.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I won't go into detail to specific companies' APIs. There are too many different APIs to cover, they change too frequently and the landscape changes too fast. By the time I will be done recording the course, there will be many new players around (and old players will no longer exist).

I do. Gold's price is purely based on speculation and is heavily inflated by the huge amount of paper gold being traded. Also, when we start mining asteroids, gold's price will be done for.

Yes! That was the plan :) Merchant integration: noted!

Did my job, commented on most of them :)

Uhh, it's not like more coins will be mined because we have a higher hashrate...

Am I too late to the party?

Oh, actually your book was already on my reading list! Haven't had the time yet, but I will definitely check it out! :)
As a fellow .NET + Bitcoin developer I think it could be handy to keep in touch... Mind if I invite you on LinkedIn?

Good, we should get rid of all these amateur exchanges as soon as possible. Let's build a new future with professional exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, etc.
