Hey, I like my tight pants. Don't hate.

Is there a coinmap for online businesses?

And likewise: You are unable to use bitcoin without computers / internet access without just using vouchers. Funny how they compliment each other so well.

Thanks mate! Will do.

Are there any significant changes that make this not feasible with IPv6?

You are completely missing my point. 
Bitcoins: work well online, work badly offline
Metal: work well offline, work badly online

It seems pretty mild to me. It would be one thing if he advocated shooting members of the government in the face, but he takes a pretty non extreme/ non radical stance that is just different. But, I guess we're disagreeing on semantics here.

I was always under the impression they sold it to the CIA which sold it to finance secret wars.

Except for trade it with anyone you see face to face, which for most people is still the majority of their trading.


Not offline you don't.

Thanks for supporting war and a police state!

Do you disagree with what I said or are you just trying to make it seem like I am wrong without stating why?

It isn't economically viable for everyone to be in a gang. It's like asking, "If government creates the black market for cocaine, why doesn't everyone sell cocaine" - it doesn't make sense.


No, because gangs are just minor governments in their beginning stages of taxation and attempting to enact their monopoly of violence. Without any government, there would not be a single gang afoot. Any early stage gangs would just be attempts at government.

What makes having a different opinion "extreme"?
@_date: 2014-04-14 07:36:39
I couldn't characterize those people; too diverse. It creates an economic incentive to act covertly as their job risks reflect years or a lifetime caged.. this can breed violence, though not necessarily.

I would argue most libertarians don't view IP as legitimate property. I mean, what kind of libertarian would sue you for copying the layout of their house?

And where do they get their funding from? What is the cause of their existence? Oh... the government regulations. They are a product of government.
