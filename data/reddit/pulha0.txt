Does this mean that there is a possible scenario where a small payment of daily life can take too many time?

How did he sell his bitcoins in Uganda?
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:23:01
Is there no simpler way? 
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:48:12
What I mean is that is probably not that simple to find someone to trade in Uganda.

Yeah... But assuming nothing malicious happens, what could go wrong in august?
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:11:01
I'm also a noob about these issues and I store some coins on coinbase. Should I be worried or do something about it? Does coinbase support bip148? What can happen to my coins August 1st?

I have bitcoins. I just want to know if some wallet provides a credit card as a feature.
@_date: 2015-10-17 10:58:15
This just happened with advcash... 
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:35:43
Hrr... What's the lesson really?

What's the difference between the private key and the password?
@_date: 2015-10-17 10:47:45
I just registered this wallet with my own e-mail and password. I also deposited a very small amount there just to use their prepaid credit card. Is this not safe at all? How can they know the private key? How is this even possible?
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:54:32
Stupid site. Now i can't withdraw because 1$ is not enough to be withdrawn

Any way to cancel this transaction? Going now with 4 confirmations
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:24:59
Not yet. It asks for 6 confirmations
