" These bitcoins are then stored in a digital wallet that exists on the cloud or the user’s computer. "    cringe
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:03:30
If you call it the cloud, then it's incorrect. Why teach others incorrectly? That's not very helpful...
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:21:25
The coins aren't stored on the wallet, definitely not on the "cloud", and most definitely not on any user's computer. They all exist on the block-chain itself. A large financial institution such as TD Ameritrade should easily have the resources at their disposal to at least get some of these basics correct. Reading that first paragraph turned me away from the whole thing.
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:32:33
so would I and mostly everyone else in this sub, which is why it's not going to 2k.

"when in doubt, zoom out."

a German would read that as "Ssitcoin" though

Sounds like you need to do some more learnin'.  The coins aren't stored on the wallet, definitely not on the "cloud", and most definitely not on any user's computer.

continue to buy more each month. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:05:34
it only matters to you, if you care about your data being sold all over the place with out you having any say in what is sold and to whom. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 03:54:15
hmmm, for shits and giggles who can ELI5? :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:16:10
shitpost, Bitcoin isn't a company.

There should be a master list of all currencies that bitcoin is more stable than to hold compared to. :D 
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:47:14
Bitcoin isn't gold, it's Bitcoin. People like to compare it to gold though. Bitcoin is scarce because it is and will be increasingly difficult to produce additional Bitcoin, and there is a fixed finite supply that can ever exist. Or something like that...

you mean the wallet? Software as far as I know right? How does this resolve OP's question? 
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:54:14
If (mostly) everyone knows that it's coming though, why wouldn't that sort of thing be priced in already?
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:27:08
100% correct my friend!  lol
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:12:43
not your keys, not your bitcoin.... simple enough. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 00:40:12
I would imagine these sorts of things are an incremental and on-going kinda deal...
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:26:02
paper wallet completely offline/off computer would arguably be the safest, but yes I agree hardware wallets are infinitely better than leaving anything on an exchange.

and this kids is why DCA is the way to go!

You are now in the 1%.

"I'm just puzzled as to why all capable manufacturers aren't contributing to Tesla, concentrating their ability to make the best car possible. Why we have projects such as Think or SABA Motors, which are diverting the available brainpower?"   See how silly that sounds? 
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:39:19
Couldn't we just say nope? No one owes shit. Start over. It's all just digital numbers anyway right? :-D 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:08:48
No block times on either of these axis m8.  Size in bytes / calendar years. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 03:41:15
you've got more serious issues to worry about in that scenario than your magical internet money.

@_date: 2017-09-19 17:30:17
indeed! 
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:46:25
not on coinbase....
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:11:36
I actually just saw this my self a week ago when I went to purchase a game for my friend. It became my first official purchase with BTC :). 
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:45:24
I noticed the fee creeping higher and higher over time at Gemini, and it was my go to for most of the year for doing my general dollarcostaverage purchases. But now I think I will just go back to coinbase pro, waaayyyy lower fees.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:53:10
bah, shouldn't have sold a lil chunk at 6400. lol  oh well

long term capital gains are just taxed at the income bracket they'd fall in for the amount they are in profit, no? so up to $9525 - 12%,  $9526-38,700 - 22%, etc.

as opposed to a skull foot?

The first time he was on JRE was what got me to fall down this hole. If you haven't already, definitely listen in to the first few times he's been a guest on JRE. I recommend listening to the first one, and then the 3rd or 4th. The 2nd they end up talking a bunch of about iphone vs android and not too much blockchain/bitcoin stuff IIRC.
