THANK YOU! This was very helpful!
I was able to copy your links and simply change the market ID... When I learn how to use DOGE tip bot, I'll tip you some!!

Fair enough. Annoying that it happens, but I suppose it was inevitable. Lot of money to be made to someone who can take peter todd's dust-b-gone and make it easy to use for people who aren't python savy, etc.

That is awesome. Say 1 in every 250 people who see that huge sign calls them and/or googles bitcoin because they don't know what it is... a lot of potential for him and the community!

Because often in order to spend them they require a higher transaction fee that makes it pointless to use. So if it gets attached to a larger sum when you send a payment, then you will end up paying more in the transaction than the free money is worth. At least this is what I understand from previous posts....

I've tried that one too. Similar problem. I don't know what you mean by parsing, sorry, noob

Ha! What? I never heard of getting wined and dined when someone steals cash from you. I've had cash stolen from me, never got anything out of it... Awful comment.

Ok. And how does the qt wallet determine whether or not to attach them to a transaction? Clearly I am missing something. Please explain...

So basically you made this one line post with no supporting evidence?!?! In no way would I ever defend MK, he is scum, but you're not much better

I agree. Bitcoin and Ripple are apples and oranges. For the record, I am a fan of both.

Doesn't matter. He achieved a goal and will now live debt free, something 99% of the 1st world will never be. He is proving its not about the money he could potentially lose, it's about living free. Bitcoins original purpose
