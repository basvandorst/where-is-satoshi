Ah okay, great. Thanks for the explanation.
Bitcoin is alive and kicking as it's ever been :)

@_date: 2016-04-25 17:02:33
Seems so
@_date: 2016-04-28 22:09:58
Ahhhhhhhhhh good point. 
So, I should research lightning transactions, which are available to me - but I'm too lazy to read up on them?
Getting really close to an understanding with your help, thanks!
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:57:49
VERY awesome response, thank you very much.
Interesting... interesting... 
@_date: 2016-04-29 01:46:55
Ahh I see. 
I'm using Block.IO as an API provider, they have lightning transacations. They ALWAYS come back clean. 
I've rebuilt my API tonight to make use of them.

I'm building a website, and it has like, "Tip 10 bits to user X"
That would be like... good? Not confusing?
@_date: 2016-04-26 02:45:42
So how much is "one Bit" ?
Thanks for reply
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:30:34
Ah okay cool, so Bitcoin made it past that?
@_date: 2016-04-26 03:22:14
So, is Bits kinda the thing?
I come over from Dogecoin, it's easy. Here's 500 Doge. 
I want it to be like, here's 500 Bits. Boom, done, I know how many that is.
Am I making the right comparison?
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:31:39
I have legit made this my desktop wallpaper!
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:32:22
Noted, thanks.
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:48:22
Yeah seems to be.
Sorry about the mobile issue, looks like it IS indeed, an issue.
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:35:46
Hi I'm from DogeCoin. I almost have 0.5 BTC now.
I have no questions at this time.
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:34:35
OHH That's an amazing idea.
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:27:41
Its a valid option.
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:34:59
I'm going to put that in for sure lololol
+100 doge (srry no btc's)

Hi every one, I'd love to hear thoughts on my new website. 
It uses Bits of Bitcoin to up vote with. So the better a users post does, the more Bits it will have. Thus, front page posts are worth a lot of Bitcoin! Come and check it out, I'd love your feedback.
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:28:59
However, BitTube.tv is built to directly work with Crypto and will yield a better environement for feature development. I can do so much more with the platform I have in place now.
@_date: 2016-01-25 00:09:14
 every one,
Just completed a massive website update, come and check out BitVo.net!
Users set up their account to use Bits of Bitcoin for voting! Come and check it out, I'd love your feedback. Cheers,

Not at all, I've just given 20k Satoshis away on /v/Bitcoin
Come on over and check for yourself.
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:49:11
Hey thanks! Come on over and get some sweet sweet satoshis.
I'm currently giving away 1000 Satoshis, is that a valuable amount in @_date: 2015-08-13 01:49:50
Hey thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:02:07
Yes, this is a reddit alternative. Check it out!
One day an official mobile app will come - but for now the entire system works perfectly on Mobile.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:25:50
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:19:39
Hmmm. neat ill look in to this, we use block.io
@_date: 2015-07-26 02:46:58
Come check it out now :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:49:55
Heya thats me!
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:14:51
So you'd want your comment to end up as permanent, on a block chain?
I think you should look in to Etherium. I believe the concept is that you can attach OBJECTS to the blockchain. They describe selling a car using Etherium, and the Ether acts as the registrant. When the Ether transfers over to my wallet I get the car, or something to that effect.
I think you should take a look and report back in!
@_date: 2016-09-02 20:29:55
Eat shit. You go back in the past to dig shit up? You're a fucking loser. 
Just so you know, I've rebuilt the entire fucking platform.
Can we discuss the  of this, it's fucking beta.
@_date: 2016-09-02 15:27:42
Mind sharing what you did to do this, so I can fix it?
@_date: 2016-09-04 22:00:39
Thanks friend, I appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-09-02 14:02:17
Hello built a Bitcoin website that allows you to drag &amp; drop images and gifs. 
The cool part? Upload some Bitcoin in Bits to the website, and you can start tipping with a graphic UI.
You can also set an optional Tip-Per-View setting, so just by looking at content, you're directly supporting the author.
Let me know what you think!
@_date: 2016-09-02 18:59:14
I actually had created a Video streaming version of this last year. I could add video to BitPixr.
The question is, and this is the experiment - are internet users willing to pay users in Bitcoin to view their content?
@_date: 2016-09-02 20:54:17
Thanks. I appreciate your comment.
@_date: 2016-09-02 15:35:09
So - did you just sit there on my website, trying to poke holes in it? Do you have tools for this?
@_date: 2016-09-02 15:57:01
Thanks, I appreciate the direct quote here. You see, it's hard to do this as a one man army.
