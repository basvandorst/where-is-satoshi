If I can make more money from loading Bitcoin than holding, why wouldn't I loan it? I just need to keep my loan rate above what I would expect to gain from holding.
You spend because you need things. I need to eat, drink, pay rent, etc, so I'm going ot spend. Today, we buy computers knowing that there will be better ones available next year for less money, and we do the same with cars and phones and a lot of other things. We buy them anyway because we need them now.

If you treat your bitcoins like USD, they will act the same way. 
Remember, you can have a near infinite number of wallets in and out of your possession. Transactions are traced to the wallet, not you. You can use a qr code as your debit cards, and you can create new one for every single transaction if you like.
If you find banks are most trustworthy, you gain little from bitcoins.

If the wallet gets stolen with a password on it, you have plenty of time to transfer it out from a backup.

If bitcoin were a stock, it would receive nothing but rave reviews talking about how bullish people are for bit coin. Nobody says how bad it is for a stock to rise continually because no one will ever cash out and buy things. Instead, he uses the term hyperdeflation to frighten the ignorant.

I'm surprised the dip didn't happen earlier when [it was announced that Greece will be selling tons of gold as part of the deal to mend its economy.](

The 10 minute transfer issue needs to be resolved. It's a known problem especially since 10 minutes is optimistic. 
We're in the car phone age of cellphones as far as bitcoins. It's 1980 with tons of room for improvement.

That video made is seem like Argentina went from Peron to Menem without bothering to mention the military junta in between.

My money appeared in my IAFCU account today. I won't entirely believe that I have it until it is transferred to my other bank account.
If this works out, I will support IAFCU, but right now I'm looking for peace of mind.

It could be done at the touch of a button without the user ever knowing a wallet is being created. Right now you need to know how bitcoins work to use it, but this is due to being in the early adoption phase.

Money received in to IAFCU and transferred to my regular bank. I officially have my money.
Now that I feel safe that my Bitfloor money is returned, I want to see what I can do to help IAFCU.

You literally have forever unless you use a trivial password.
The better encryption gets, the more effective social methods are. If you are held at gunpoint with your ATM card, it's all gone. If you are held at gunpoint in your house, you will be robbed. I don't see bitcoins as any worse in this regard.

No response. I have called the bank and left a message, but heard from no one.

The link between nature and opportunity seems tenuous. I can argue the same for food or sunlight if you are willing to trace it back far enough, but it doesn't seem helpful.
You can be a broker anywhere, although they are concentrated in NYC. The point that I wanted to make is that there are plenty of opportunities to make excellent money (doctor, lawyer, engineer) that can work in almost any location and require minimal land. I do not see how their opportunity is tied to land availability within scale of their earnings.
I really do want to understand geolib as the idea that no one created land makes sense. It's the what to do about it without making things worse that is lost on me.

I received my call from IACU today to verify my account information. I have entered the information in to BitFloor's web site. I won't be holding my breath, but at least this seems to be moving along.

Most consumer safes aren't rated for very long: 30 minutes to an hour. Sentry's (average safes found everywhere) web site has their home safes rated for 30 minutes and the business line rated for an hour.

Inflation is not an invention of the right wing. It's US monetary policy. Shenanigans is in the eye of the beholder, but the Fed policy is to manipulate the money supply and fund government programs via that manipulation. Whether you think that is right or not (and how much Leprechaun blood you have) will determine whether you call it shenanigans. 


So far, at least 8,000 years. While I understand why you think gold is overvalued, gold's history from antiquity to today as a store of value is unmatched, not just by individuals but by the central banks of every major country in the world.

That would cover 5% of the world's transactions.

The question is: how big does this pool of people get? If we have millions of people with bitcoins that want to exchange them for goods, this creates a marketplace for the exchange, encouraging businesses to accept them as payment and allowing users to avoid the exchange fees they would incur if they had to convert to currency. The advantages of bitcoin are huge. This is going to be popular with many people, regardless of whether it catches on with the population at large which at least guarantees a floor of value.

If another currency emerges which offers improvements on Bitcoin, why wouldn't people jump on it? This will devalue Bitcoin and the better currency begins to take hold. It's survival of the fittest currency which gives people incentive to make things better.
No matter the fate of any upstart, the current dominant player has a huge advantage as it will be readily accepted and more easily fungible.

Set up my ACH transfer on 7/11. I am still "under review."

Store it encrypted on the phone or store a smaller wallet's key. It's still better than carrying a wad of cash. I think you'd be nuts to store your life savings on there, but I'm sure we will read the story of someone who did that and donated the phone to charity.

Being absolutely certain does not require religious zeal. It only requires you to open your eyes.

They could embed tracking and taxation and people would use it if it eased conversion from USD to dUSD and spending on good we're as easy as paper money.

There is a big difference between setting up standards by which you agree to adhere and having a government restrain you.

It is interesting that my Bitfloor account still shows the money in my account and that my transfer is still under review.

They're rich because they provide services as well: fuel processing and distribution, potable water treatment and delivery, and communications.
I fail to see how using land excludes others from opportunity. There are plenty of other ways to raise a fortune. There aren't a lot of stock brokers saving up for arable land so they can start their careers, but you imply that the farmland would be best inhabited by stock brokers because they generate more income/sq-ft though they don't need it.
