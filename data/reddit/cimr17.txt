Cheer the fuck up. HODL. And wait for the peak and get out. Why would you put your eggs in one basket. There’s tons of cryptocurrency out there. XRP

Like coinbase but has less fees and doesn’t have an App.

Garbage post.

Go to the Gemini website, view your wallet, scan it the QR code via Coinbase app and send ETH or BTC.

@_date: 2018-08-15 11:06:50
Did you mean “buy” bitcoin and not by? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 01:19:39

@_date: 2017-11-24 16:52:44
What app!!!?
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:13:57
Honestly man....I transferred my coins to Gemini and withdraw from Gemini. It’s a nice feeling to see a bank statement that reads Gemini Trust Fund, LLC. Best of luck.

Post the video link.

What’s the secrecy? As if the government doesn’t have your information already. They’re the ones that issued you your identification. Coinbase isn’t bad. They initially weren’t or did not provide the irs documentation. But of course the US Gov put pressure and won. If you have money to invest then invest it legitimately. A lot of the other exchanges always get hacked and have security breaches. Your $10k with Coinbase/Gdax/Gemini are gonna be fine. I have way over ten times that and have no issues. Best of luck trying to rack up crypto from other sources and or atms that will charge you a ridiculous amount.

He does have a lot of Karma. Maybe he’s drunk. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:37:08
At least she puts out
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:27:15

@_date: 2017-10-15 23:53:36
Can you purchase with eth as well? 
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:41:48
Usaa is the way to go. They invest on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:31:39
I don’t think they allow US citizens to have TenX...yet
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:13:43
Let us know if you find out. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:29:51
Good one. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:50:52
How much did you pay for it?
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:19:34
Stop posting news from 2014. 
Bitcoin recap website is broken and twitter hasn’t published since 2014. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:14:37
Let’s see those screenshots and transactions. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:36:44
Wish I had $3k laying around to spare. Send me your notes ;) lol 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:31:41
Zoom out man. Don’t focus on the price. I bought my first bitcoin at $180. But look at it now. It’s a rollercoaster, a very fun one.
