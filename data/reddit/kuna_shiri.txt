It is same like in our country where police is looking for illegal grow farms often on places with high electricity consummation. Maybe some Bitcoin miners makes them finding more difficult.

Countries with limited access to foreign currency has some benefits from miners.

It is like real opposition for one state are real terrorist for second state. And legal president from elections is called butcher to not have doubts when fighting against him.

Well right now there is a lot of misinformation being broadcasted by politicians with the aim of discouraging people flocking to mining and declaring mining equipment illegal etc. This is basically mostly due to the heat of the summer and power company being under pressure to avoid having power cuts. They also have a valid point about somewhat this is synonymous as exporting kilowatt hours of energy but with the subsidised cost. The fault is with the farmers who literally took advantage of subsided under 1c costs meant for industry and agriculture and using this for mining, but then again they also have a valid argument saying that those subsidised are being wasted on industries that are either already well within profit margins that don’t need the support or are a loss making industry (such as a lot of agro farming in Iran) and bitcoin mining instead could bring the much needed foreign currency at least into the hands of people.
This whole controversy over mining has also brought into the spot light a lot of sad people who invested in pyramid schemes disguised as crypto, such as what i recently learnt from a friend of mine in Iran who invested about 20k into a coin called E2C... Lots of swindlers have got into it too...
There is a battle now between three wings of the government, treasury whose trying to control any ICOs and such (even released a mandate couple of months earlier), Iranian telecom company and its young minister who is pro crypto... and the Power company whose basically seizing equipment and trying to manage its own shortcomings in the power distribution etc.
Anyways its a brewing shitstorm... however i have a feeling they’re going to legitimise it, and crypto is going to take Iran like a storm... Every person and their grandmother is enquiring about bitcoin and crypto from their more technically inclined friends...
TDLR: It’s a story in development but the awareness of crypto in Iran has gone through the roof mostly seen as an investment or a way to trade with the outside world due to sanctions.

The SafeCoin will be quite different then other cryptocurrencies. It has some ambition to be instant, unlimited scalable, with little fee as spam protection and anonymous - only last transaction is stored.
It will use Proof of resources, which are vaults(nodes) with running HDD to run SAFE network. The main thing is, that 1/3 of bad nodes can interrupt one section and 2/3 of nodes in one section can make doublespend. So there are few mechanisms which will make it much harder for bad actors. Like to validate transaction you have to run your vault for some period until network will need your vault. Other is, that you can not add few bad nodes in same section as you wish.
The incentive to run vaults is farming Safecoins. These you will get for every GET request from users.  
Inflation of coins is not set, but based on algorithm, where more coins is released when network is growing and more used. But every time user store some data on SAFEnetwork these coins are burned. So there can be also deflation.
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:49:02
I think that with atomic swap or application will allow to use more cryptocurrencies if they will be widely used.
But yes, I think that lot of projects could exist with out own cryptocurrency like exchanges, wallet (crypto, tenX) etc.

* Here is good topic about SoLiD and SAFE network base difference:
"They still use the old Internet/Web for much of what they do, however, their vision is not for full-on security and privacy at that level. They advocate everyone basically owns their own “silo” or server where they give access to different people/apps etc. under the control at all times of the user.
A bit like what we showed with patter/not patter, the users data is the users data, so similarities in the message from them and us.
But, there are differences, whilst we agree users data should only be accessible through the user and never pulled into some corporate network, we also say users should not have to run servers! These servers for SOLID are pretty simple affairs, but very clever. They are though direct accessible Internet IP addresses and have all the server vulnerabilities that servers today have.
So directly connectable IP addresses -&gt; This is where we have CRUST to make all (well most really) computers accessible and only via encrypted communications.
We add routing to find such computers (not DNS lookups or some database of known servers etc.).
Then the bigger difference, in SAFE everyone’s data is spread across multiple locations and constantly being moved around as computers go on and off, so no administration required from the user, no backups and no server-based vulnerabilities. However, a sticky point for us is that we do not wish for the SAFE data to be mixed with clearnet data at all, so there is a tension between allowing all SOLID silos in non SAFE form interact with our secured data management. This will need to be resolved otherwise it will look like “competition” as we resist clearnet and SOLID really want it. I suspect we can make the case and we should.
So very similar parts of the vision, give the net back to the people, but we do not want them to have the same net they used o have in terms of servers and the associated issues with those (such as everyone having to rent out a VM or something)."
* Integration:
"the Maidsafe team are working on integrating standards such as RDF into the SAFE Network so that apps designed to work on Solid should also work on SAFE.  has made some connections with TBL and the (so) solid crew and they are looking at how the two can interact."
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:38:33
But as you said. Bitcoin is proven to be safe. This is not the same as side chains. Other thing is, that not all is possible with same target on blockchain based system, so they use different.

I watch what Bram Cohen is building and what I know it is mainly eficient cryptocurrency. 
There are not yet similar PoR, but similar idea for Ethereum 
So yes, it it most important part to have bug free and secure mechanism and there is no intention to replace Bitcoin.
The real difference is, that no one is pushing you to use crypto to pay with, but SAFEnetwork will make many use cases in own network where you have to use it, or if some servise will be for free like forum, than owner will pay it for you.
One of the possible use case is to replace part of torrent traffic. You have to just once upload content( pay PUT ) and no seeders needed forever (and every time somebody will download it for free farmer gets Safecoins). 
Almost anything can be run on SAFEnetwork, even if it needs today powerful server. You have to redesign it to serverless autonomous version to get it much more secure and attack resistent. The other big difference is, that if application or servise users use, than developer(s) will recieve reward of 5-10% from each GET.
So the most bad thing is, that it will need lot of develepment from Maidsafe team and other developers of services. Today we probably have about 2 years till lunch and Alpha 3 should be this year.

That might be problem if one Bitcoin is worth $1 000 000 000, than one satoshi is worth $10, so minimum transaction.

1 bitcoin is always 1 bitcoin until you send and pay transaction fee.

That is main use case, exchanges will transfer Bitcoins between each other in matter of seconds and main blocks will remain half empty for us.

It looks that mnemonic words does not match with public address and private key. Not sure why, but I just write down from iancolema.io these four details on paper and move there BTC.
So now I am trying to find way to get BTC with private key only.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:34:33
The address I choose was first on list with own privat key...
On that site you can create BIP141 P2W2KH nested in p2SH
Only in this case the first address is m/0/0
(derivation path m/0 )
BIP49 first address is m/49'/0'/0'/0/0
(derivation path m/49'/0'/0'/0 )

The taxes are high and not making sense. If you bought Bitcoin for benefits over fiat, than why you would sell it back for cash. 
It is longtime investment with now way back to cash. Just waiting for wider adoption , bigger crisis, hyperinflation etc.

Not the whole drop from $6000-8000, but the last few days. There was big manipulation with price after BCH hard fork similar to this one.
