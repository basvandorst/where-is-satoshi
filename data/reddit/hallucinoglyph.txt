There has been massive network congestion and astronomical transaction fees since 2013? That's reassuring :)

But the ones paying attention to the tech are the ones stirring dissent lol.

100% feel the same. Not trying to shill ... actually, ... yeah, I guess technically I am :-P, but IOTA's network actually works more efficiently the more spam and "overwhelming" demand it receives (since each transaction verifies two pending transactions). So, literally the opposite of the scaling problem Bitcoin and every other blockchain runs into. For this reason, there are also no transaction fees at all. If you want to beat credit cards and bank transfers on the grounds of time and efficiency (and fees!), I think IOTA is the crypto to do it. Bitcoin is clogged up with heavy traffic. I'm losing my enthusiasm for it :-/

Good thing they are gearing toward being the transactional backbone of the Internet of Things - a tsunami of devices constantly spamming (and thus strengthening) the network. I am hopeful! :-)

Oh I agree! :)

Very reminiscent of the divisions of the original Christian Church into the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholics and eventually the myriad of Protestants. Each will present a consistent path through their own church :P
