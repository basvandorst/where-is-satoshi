LIVE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DEBATE PLZ

In my personal experience they have been shady as fuck. I stay away from this pseudo exchange. Honestly, I'm surprised they're still afloat with the amount of shit floating around about their service.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:51:48
The most profitable nodes will be on exchanges. The first exchange that enables LN for deposits and withdrawals will be the shit. You'll know they're not joking. That will prove their tech expertise and ensure you about their sec capabilities.

He is clearly an expert on Bitcoin, technology and security. Also economical genius and first person ever in the world and universe who ever invested his time, intellect and energy in bitcoin back in 2001. He is the real deal.

Aiming for 1.0 for the 10 year anniversary would make for great headlines: "After 10 years of intense development, Bitcoin is finally out of beta!"...
Just saying...
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:28:50
And that he has a very, very poor judgement when it comes to technology and security. He believes what he wants to believe and uses half-truths and his loud mouth to rationalise it. He lost approx 500 BTC in Mtgox collapse (public info).

I don't believe that mining s2x will be more profitable than mining core bitcoin. And miners can't mine at a loss in a long term. The 95% miners support is gone, if the price of s2x is 10%, or even 50% of core value, which is highly unlikely.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:01:19
Yeah, as Andreas said, we are near the stage when mining equipment (ASIC chips) don't change every month, but every year or so. It's about time for some ASIC producer to develop an ASIC home heating unit. But issue with home heating is the noise. OP's idea sounds great, i.e commercial use, so noise doesn't really matter.

I just saw at financial times someone is re-using the 'classic bubble' chart over bitcoin price chart, and, very originally, referred to tulip mania. Made me laugh. They used the very same graph and story at $40 to $3 drop, and later at $350 to $200 drop... They're brain dead. Whoring for attention again and again. That's why experienced hodlers will always HODL.

But with lack of Replay protection there will only be a few exchanges supporting it. It will be worth much less than BCash fork.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:33:35
I think the issue is that they want to pretend the s2x fork is the only REAL blockchain, hence why bother with replay protection if the other bitcoin ~doesn't exist~. They don't care about the core bitcoin users that they're leaving.
In reality, it will be just a little more difficult to split your s2x coin off the wallet, and to find an exchange crazy enough to enable s2x/btc trading, so you can dump it.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:32:02
Let's be honest. They are not the sharpest crayons. Don't expect them to figure out bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:55:29
How can it? There are no, or very few exchanges trading s2x coin from day one. Which means its price craaaaaashes. Which means miners immediately switch back to core...

It's perfect time for hard forks, to watch them fail, to prove that fork coins are worthless once for all. 
Just sell your fork coins and enjoy a little bump in your bitcoin holding, while watching the duchebags burn.

Yeah, someone should break it down to simple terms for all third party purposes, so this gets implemented quicker in mobile wallets, exchanges, payment processors, mining pools etc. I fucking hate overpaying because some lazy fuck  hard coded a fixed amount in btc (0.001 with empty mempool is insane).

To clarify, no ID required as long as you keep exchanging across crypto-currencies only.   
But still, they're pretty awesome. I hope they'll accept s2x coin as well, for fast dropping.

I can't say much about ledger. I use Trezor and can 100% recommend it. It's a beautiful piece of hardware. Well designed with an engineer feel to it. You can use it safely with any android phone with, for example, Mycelium wallet app, and make transactions wherever you are. On the software side, Trezor is outstanding as well. They provided bitcoin cash splitting tool very fast. They were first to implement segwit address support. Tremendous. Plus, any potential bugs reported by the community are fixed quickly. I couldn't be happier with this device.
Edit: Trezor is the way to go before the s2x chain split. I'm sure they will be first to enable splitting of the fork coin, so you can sell it before the mass dumping begins.
