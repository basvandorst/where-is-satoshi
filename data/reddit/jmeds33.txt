how much of an upside potential will a house have when mature 3d printing technology starts printing them for 1/10 of the cost and time? 
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:08:56
The only down side with bitcoins i see is that you cant "make it rain" at the clubs
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:31:35

Story of my bitcoin this month
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:28:15
Wait til it generates more interest than the US dollar
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:11:59
Ahh i see, well this answers my question. Are those set in stone? I wonder if those names would stick as the popularity rises. I was hoping for bytecoin or something
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:39:47
we are the free market
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:32:12
Anything people accept as payment is a currency. Such as gold back in the good ole days when there were no central banks

Sorry my fat finger pressed submit just now. Anyways long story short. Bought pizza from Papa Johns, bought beer and snacks from my local CVS (no ID since im a regular customer) and bought a bunch of flowers for my mom from Lowes. 
Officially upgraded from being a speculator =) thanks gyft 
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:46:02
I can confirm what the bitcoin CEO said 
@_date: 2013-06-26 02:51:22
extreme logic used
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:54:55
i juts see a square

What if only one countries currency collapses? I think someone in that country would be better off with bitcoin since it has international support
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:49:26
that, or she was reading the troll box
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:24:53
I go back and forth Bitcoin and NSFW ;-) 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:24:52
Lots of valuable time and dwolla upon other methods
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:21:37
If he understood it better I'm sure Mr. Paul would be a proponent
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:45:08
I'm scared, but still buying 
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:45:16
Yup noticeable improvement 
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:19:35
well in 5 years when bitcoin is $100000 they'll be sorry 
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:59:47
because buying something at its' all time high is scary
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:27:18
damn MTGOX making me wait so long to get verified ughh i could have bought at $50 :( 
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:16:41
true, but did it not crash in the past? 
do you think its just going to go up for a while? no correction? 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:34:36
they're usually reliable, which worries me 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:06:32
how big is this news?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:42:58
Diversification of bitcoins adds value

@_date: 2013-04-14 22:47:39
Price is being manipulated on Gox
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:38:34
damn no troll box
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:11:28
i gave some small amounts of  btc with no problems ...
Why? because i gave them links where they are able to gamble with it lol
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:29:41
This is probably when they will throw Litecoin in the mix
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:58:28
Oh and i tried to get Burger King but apparently its only accepted at certain locations. Make sure your local BK accepts it beforehand 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:35:07
damn no troll box :(
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:59:13
one foot long: about .0085 btc, nice!

@_date: 2013-12-05 22:02:26
gyft.com I highly recommend this service. they even have an android and ios app 
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:50:30
Maybe not wall street, but the fed? They have the power to pump and dump without any financial loss since they have the power to create dollas

OMFGOX 
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:49:20
will text message be replaced by bitmessage?  
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:49:55
I would say transfer your bitcoins out of the site when you are sleeping. Last thing you want is waking up and the site is gone 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:44:20
they should have seen the crash coming. I sold as soon as the candle lite up bright red
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:56:05
This will cause the rise of other crypto currencies. Competition is not a sin. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:32:17
Yeah yeah thats the place, drunk bastards 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:58:17
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:38:40
I hope it crashes a bit, I want to invest but it's scary at this price 
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:21:45
I think people want to get away from traditional central bank controlled currencies, and if bitcoin continues the path of success, maybe someday in the future 1 bitcoin could be worth as much as 1 once of gold. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 02:01:06
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:32:04
Mind blown :-D 
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:59:07
I just bought bitcoin for the first time today, made me laugh
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:58:16
I hope, I think most of us are just stuck hitting the refresh button
@_date: 2013-10-22 02:36:09
I wouldn't be surprised if the volume continues to rise. China has a large, wealthy, tech savvy population and adding all the positive bitcoin related news out of the country... Depending how fast the trend grows there we could possibly see them taking the driver seat.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:50:58
What if we all donate a small percentage of bitcoins to the bitcoin marketplace. Possibly promote bitcoin market growth 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:17:10
Twice as funny faded
@_date: 2013-06-07 20:42:14
What would happen if drug lords use bitcoin for money laundering? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:59:55
modafinil 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:16:40
LTC has a good shot long term because competition is good for the overall market much like Coke and Pepsi compete IMP
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:02:09
Why cant we be our own banks 
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:09:33
I would be happy even as janitor for a company like bitpay

why don't you have a DDOS protection service?
@_date: 2013-07-26 01:52:21
I think it will still be interesting, but we're definitely not seeing dudes trying to survive in Amsterdam &amp; convincing people to sell drugs and girls for bitcoins. I think i found my way to promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:38:21
I hope so :p
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:48:03
lol dont worry its just usd
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:42:45
Thanks, you bought me a beer or two
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:44:06
is this a scam?
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:44:14
Bye Dwolla. goodluck. It was nice while it lasted. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:55:21
They would probably change the code, privatize, &amp; promote their own version of a crypto currency 
@_date: 2013-10-22 02:42:05
aaanndd... they're in the driver seat
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:47:02
Look into Litecoin its cheaper and the price should skyrocket as soon as mtgox starts trading it. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:35:33
Good luck, you'll need it
@_date: 2013-10-03 00:41:36
This is neither good or bad.
I think sr did its job to make bitcoin more popular and the idea of autonomous companies will continue to capture more peoples imagination 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:39:25
I havent had a problem with btc-e. actually its really stable. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:58:17
One gas station needed to complete the loop

A real global economy that produces goods and services entirely outside fiat 
@_date: 2013-04-20 07:25:54
Or shut down
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:03:41
I just bought my first few bitcoins
hoping it does not crash but if it does, im not too worried, in it for the long term ;)
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:31:41
bernanke, is that you?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:16:05
Stay Calm and Buy bitcoins, maybe
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:29:44
Come on guys you sound like the trolls on the btce troll box

@_date: 2013-04-01 21:45:26
I overheard it at a bar somewhere
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:05:05
A new millionaire diversifying their bitcoin to hungry world sick of fiat 
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:31:38
thanks, i was unaware of this site. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:11:39
as a new buyer, this is exciting 
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:37:21
Thankfully we still have a free market, android here I come
