highly recommend getting out right now when there is this kind of money at stake. i just sold 5 figures worth that I bought 4 weeks ago (6% profit) and going to buy back in when it goes back down

nah that wouldn't have offset it

why down rate me? i'm telling you the truth. with the mt gox sell off coming up next month this market is going to bleed out. i'm assuming a whale down rating me. you guys are almost as bad as the state funded lotto that robs dreams of poor people.

I just assume everyone here has bitcoin(s) so a 4-5% drop in said bitcoin(s) is well over 500 dollars. I highly doubt no one here is making that kind of money in a day

I'm not new to cryptos, been in the scene since 2012 using them for payment methods. Can provide my Hackforums account for post history if anyone wants it lol. I look back at my wallet from back in the day and if I kept everything I would have been a millionaire lol.

he probably is doing some kind of black hat activity, refunding/se product services or sqli injection services, or selling accounts/passwords to various sites. not hard to make a couple hundred dollars a day in bitcoin that way if you know what you're doing. I mean let's be honest, unless you're a freelance programmer who does jobs for bitcoin (could happen but I doubt it) you're not doing a legit business in the first place, no company is going to get in trouble for tax evasion for paying their employees in bitcoin lol.
