The sole benefit is that you might be able to make a slightly cheaper transaction in the future if it's put onto a segwit address now.

You must have just updated past 1.3 as it's no longer required.
I agree it was a pain, although Ledger wins hands down for me due to their proactive nature in natively supporting alts via their app.
Trezor has been playing catchup for more than a year now and they are still trailing behind.

Your btc are fine and you don't need to do anything.
Next time you want to receive a deposit, either chose a segwit or legacy address and send funds there.
If you have sent them to a segwit address, you'll be able to create a segwit transaction next time you want to spend from that address and if you have sent them to a legacy address it will be a regular bitcoin transaction.

And after you've finished with the Bitcoin Whitepaper (that absolutely everyone involved In the space should have read at least once) I suggest the Ethereum Yellow Paper to take an even deeper diver down the rabbit hole.
