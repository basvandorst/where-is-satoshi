The asker should mention that it is already able to purchase steam games and fill up their steam wallet with bitcoin through 3rd party websites (steambits, steamloader, etc...).
The market for it is clearly there, why not add native support for it in steam?

You are forgetting stealthflation. The ingredients of the hamburger are probably not to the same standard it once was.

It really depends. You can find studies supporting both sides. For many things, the negative studies tend to not use as large as a dose as the positive studies.
This is especially true for Vitamin D. Every negative study on it only tests the daily recommended amount, which is 400 IU. Your body alone can absorb up to ~7500 IU a day from the sun. In the winter months I take 10000 IU of D a day and haven't had a cold/flu in 5 years.

There will be prices. A computer will determine if you are worth expending resources. If you are not you will be re-educated or discarded.

It was. They fell short but since they showed tremendous growth in the last two months they renewed the contract anyway.

Space is awesome, but it'd be nice if I could pay my monthly bill to Virgin Mobile in bitcoin.

Poker recently got my brother into bitcoins. He has a lot of friends who play who would probably be interested once my brother has some success with it. 
He is not very tech savvy so I had to help him set up secure wallets and do a few write-ups so he could manage his own accounts and set up any more wallets. 
There is a definite need for easier solutions to start trading to lower the barrier of knowledge to use bitcoins because there are a lot of people who'd use bitcoins but don't have the patience of figuring it out.
It doesn't have to be a pay service if it helps the average person use bitcoins because the higher the demand of bitcoins the greater the value of our bitcoins will be.

I'm surprised he wasn't advocating putting mercury, aluminum and cancer causing virus laden vaccines into cash and giving it to poor people out of Uncle Ben's helicopter.

It was like that before, it just so happened we didn't hit highs every single day for a couple of weeks straight. 
This was the top post a little over 2 months ago:

I knew that [secret NSA facility]( in Utah was really just a bitcoin mining operation!

As did I. Just wish I had the money to buy bitcoins before this month.

In other words, big banks have no interest in bitcoin.

Those posts have been here for the six months I've been subscribed. It just happens that we've hit a lot more milestones in this past month than the other 5 months combined.

I feel lucky that I bought my daily max of 10 when the price dipped to 24.8 yesterday.
