check out this page i came across on instgram ( got a follow off them this morning) seems like the creators might have something to do with the recent downward spiral of bitcoin... All of a sudden raffling them off ??&gt;&gt;&gt;

Turn it in mate. It’s annoying. No two ways about it. I bought in at 5k before most people who joined the “hype” train. I’m saying it’s annoying seeing it in red all the time haha

How does the Gym know it is you who has sent that payment in. If every transaction is anonymous how do they link that payment to you... hard question to explain but you know what i mean. when you send a payment to someones wallet for example does the payment come with a 'unique number' so you can quote your number and the gym and know its from you ?

To be honest I’m not that’s interested in trading. I want my coins from my breadwallet in my coin base account so i can get my money out. Having made 80 quid profit. Any help ?

Okay that makes sense but I can’t just HODL forever at one stage I’m gonna want to get my “profit” out ? How do I do this using breadwallet ?
