It is the first fork of Bitcoin and it is a digital currency.
If you send me NMC, i will accept it as payment.

Cheap, lifelong and decentralized .bit domains are not bad ;)
And - a good solution for squatted .bit domains is using a new Namespace for domains and ask the DNSCHAIN team for example to integrate it for resolving. Everybody can register new data in a fresh Namecoin namespace ...

DNSCHAIN = How to resolve domain names without ICANN - censorfree and decentralized with the help of Namecoin and .BIT domains.
Eli5 would be maybe "DNSCHAIN = Internet without ICANN" ;)

Will be even Namecoin integration for human readable nicknames. It's using the /id namespace of Namecoin and the latest NMC client supports payments to Namecoin's nicknames, too.
Here is a nice video i've found promoting OpenBazaar:

What exactly? I assume you mean the second paragraph.
In short words - to solve cybersquatting in Namecoin just use an other namespace than d/. The price is high enough to avoid senseless squatting on the new namespace like at earlier and cheaper times of Namecoin.
The resolving part is part of your Namecoin DNS resolver. I've mentioned DNSCHAIN as an example.

It's no a simple extension - it is a full grown hybrid DNS Server, with access to the Namecoin blockchain. It enables surfing .BIT domains on every Browser without hassle.

DNSCHAIN is a good hybrid DNS resolver for traditional and Namecoin .BIT domains.
An alternative solution is using one of OpenNIC DNS Server - they resolve .bit domains per default. But the 100% perfect solution is using your own Namecoin DNS Server like DNSCHAIN.

DNSCHAIN is a very good DNS Server for easy access to Namecoin .BIT Domains with many features. A good try before we have Chrome and Firefox "builtin" support ;)
Here is the DNSCHAIN thread:

You can just use OpenNIC for an easy way.
Disadvantages are: trust and missing SSL. But good for the "first contact" to Namecoin.
Just use an OpenNIC Server for surfing to .bit domains (configure it in Windows/Linux/OSX).
They have a bridge to Namecoin .bit Domains.

If Namecoin would be only .bit domains, you would be right.

Somebody interested in this thread at ?
How would I fork Bitcoin's current v0.9.2.1 release to make a wallet-only Namecoin-compatible client that supports merged mining?
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:32:30
Nope ;) It's a DNS server, which is able to access Namecoin .BIT domains with a lot of additional features.
You can trust a foreign DNSCHAIN server, or as you indicated it would be better to run DNSCHAIN on your own system (suggested by the author Greg Slepak).
More information on github: 
So all you need to view Namecoin .BIT domains is installing DNSCHAIN and run Firefox, Chrome, etc.

Google Play needs some time - patience my young padawan :D We are all waiting for it.

God, we've waited so long for it :) Mobile Payment for Namecoin and a secure wallet !

**Namecoin Wallet for Android - a independent production by [Hash Engineering]( !
Pure send/receive/payment features with a fork of the rockstable Schildbach Wallet for Bitcoin. 
Namecoin specific features are added most likely in the next step.
I am sure a Bitcoin/Namecoin/Android crack will add these functions fast. Maybe you, BitcoinWallet ?

Download and install the .apk manually for the time.

Would be a great feature, maybe in the next step.
