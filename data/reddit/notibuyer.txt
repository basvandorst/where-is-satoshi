What is it then? Elaborate. Shouldn't miner hold a full node by default?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:49:09
I'd use them. too bad they don't have Karbo there

Congratulations! But it seems you don't really know what Bitcoin is as your freind stated, though you mined it, as you cashed out almost all of it. And put 150k into fund by that time you can use it fiat might be worth 0 proportionally devaluated towards Bitcoin and other crypto. Though I don't blame you. 
As for Bitcoin Cash and other forks - your reaction tells me you know nothing about those worthless coins. 
But I am glad you can cash them out - all of them. 
Leave at least 1 BTC for future, what do you have to lose?
One day you may thank me for this advice. This will be the day when 1 Bitcoin is worth 1BTC - NO fiat involved.

Yep, but that was inevitable. As this is evolution. Evolution gives the best "genes" adapted to the environment. Evolution in blockchain world gives the best crypto for specific needs to the free market. No regulation though and decentralization of people, creating communities of interests.  
Say, my community is mostly united around Karbo as we see its value in high anonimity, lowest fees possible (not to mention IOTA which is based on DAG technology rather than blockchain) and which is more important real usage on the market as it was meant to be for crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:53:31
Oh, and if you want to hop in on a second opportunity train, guess it's the right time to start mining Karbo (still possible with your computer). ))

But miners should be a part of a huge decentralized system, while  pools are not miners themselves and are more centralized which makes things paradoxical to me. Remote computing leads to centralization of pools, good thing though is that they are all incentivised by gains not distruction of the system. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:17:09
Yep, almost same happened to me but within only 20 years term and while holding a few more currencies other than Bitcoin: Karbo, Litecoin, Ether...
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:16:57
I see what you mean. What would you call it then when miners cannot mine without blockchain (the whole point of mining is to sustain blockchain, hash and verify transactions) for a fact, but they do mine because they use pools and those pools do have the blockchain although the pools do not mine themselves but use the power of miners altogether?

Can I create one as cold storage wallet or what trustworthy company provides a desktop software with GUI for these type of wallets?
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:21:13
thanks! Do you know if this technique is provided by some mobile apps wallets?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:19:26
thank you
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:42:20
seems like from what people advised I can only store the number of a cold storage wallet and then use the app for draggin that info out of my chip
@_date: 2017-01-29 18:32:25
Even if they were used to make harm to people? Like stealing, killing, demanding with force?
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:28:47
already have it implanted - it works through NFC protocol
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:35:28
Hmmmm, but wouldn't that mean the devision of Bitcoin community and split of different transaction into multiple "branches" with possibly no confirmations of the blocks at some point? 
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:28:14
In reality it is much easier and faster to make a small cut on the skin and squeeze it out than chopping a hand ))
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:41:29
it does pretty well. but you need a good NFC reader though
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:37:19
Thank you for your answer. That seems legit to me. I would just not want this to be used against innocent people too - like "fake reporting" would kill reputation of sometlone who is not involved into a crime. Need to think about some really good algorithm to protect against these ilegitimate reports. But I guess if it's up to community - the majority would check and support - like proof of stake algorithm or something? What do you think? 
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:20:49
1. It's exactly more secure because of the fact that you cannot lose it.
2. Yeah, definitely you have to always make a copy just in case -, that's the nature of "things" they tend to break because of entropy. But for now it works just fine. Others have the same chip for years overwriting it many times. 
3. Yes, you might have a breach of security if someone reaches you very close like 2 millimeters away from your arm and find the exact location of the transponder cause it's very difficult to locate it. There are some researchers now to make it protected with the password - new generations of chips would have a higher security.
4. With adoption and cross-fucntioning of new technologies like Blockchain, AI and biohacking things will start evolving much faster. It's just the matter of time and acknowledgement
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:27:11
I already have it installed in my hand, so I would like to use it for this purpose. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:42:43
np. thanks for your answer anyway
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:38:18
Greed is only where Bitcoin is being traded as an asset. Bitcoin should be a means of fair trading of goods.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:28:22
what? ))

oh, no )0 I am this guy

Well, lightning network will allow you to do things so to speak "off-chain" but whenever you close the channel the info about transactions will go into Blockchain network anyway showing the wallets used. 
If you truly want to puzzle your actions (as if you have anything to hide or illigal you had done?) you can always use monero. 
Again, let me stress on this please once again, the suggestion has nothing to do with soft or hard fork. If one is very curious one can always find and track the activity of Bitcoin wallets including illigal one thanks to the news on the net. 
Recently hackers locked people in a hotel and asked for a ransom of 1 BTC as far as I remember. What if there was some sick person inside or what is worse, children locked and a fire starts etc, etc. That was an illegal activity and any other activity connected with that wallet would be considered by me unprefferrable to deal with and that is my humanistic point of view which I have the right to have in the community, right? 
So I'd like to know right away and would prefer to have either simple algorithm doing it for me in my wallet or even an advanced AI (in the future) providing me with an advice whether it is worth dealing with this or that wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:30:10
Exactly, that's the point of cryptoanarchy! See and decide for yourself how you wanna deal with it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:30:02
it would be if I didn't have it and specifically wanted to install but I already have it and it is much more efficient to have it with me (that is in me) )) all the time and use it when needed
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:05:41
Cause when your assets on a centralized exchange you don't control your wallet and private keys belong to exchange. So whatever happens with your bitcoins doesn't depend on you. Consider agreement between 2 parties broken and the 2d party doing whatever it wants.  
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:19:29
That's pretty cool and I finally will be bale to use my LEdger Nano S with mobile app  but when is it going to happen? When I searched I found nothing except for this announcement. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:20:44
Agree. But I guess before they got a bigger market they wanted to make it work as soon as possible and that is why that was their choice. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:26:15
Let her invest 30% at most and convince her it's what a wise busienss entity would do )
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:22:13
By the way do you know anything about Brave on blockchain. I think I heard the news they had a closed ICO or something? But did they do anything yet?  
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:14:58
Even if this is going to happen, which potentially possible in the future there must be another technological solution in Bitcoin to achieve fungibility like in Monero or Karbo
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:41:49
I wonder how do you technically do it? Do exchanges sell such an amount at once? Is it a wire to the account? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:30:56
Or British
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:18:57
Even if he was Satoshi, who he is not, but even if he was , who cares now what he said? Bitcoin is here and it's not up to him to decide what's white and what's black but the community. Don't you see this guy is delusional? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:51:18
Yeh, me too got it. So funny )))
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:38:21
Coinbase sucks long time already as I see. While crypto is connected to fiat we'll always experience this shitty problems. I cannot send my 3.22 ETH for 5 days already to my MEW but that's a minor thing in comparison to your issue.
