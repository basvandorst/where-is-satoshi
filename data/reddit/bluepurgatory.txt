The subreddit has been flooded with price posts long before the price hit 10k USD. For as long as I can remember (browsing the sub since the price was around 3k) at least 70% of all posts were price memes or some random pundit hyping up the price by saying that he expects bitcoin to hit $120,000 by August of 2018 based on advanced modeling rooted in a comparison of bitcoin's market cap and adoption rate to x, y, z. . . .      
There's only so much to discuss on the technical side to hold an average person's interest. Singing the praises of a small number of use cases (lookin' at you, Zimbabwe posters) is great and all, but there's not too much "news." This isn't a medium for people to discuss minutiae of the source code, so when I see these posts saying "DAE remember when the sub wasn't just about price? I actually believe bitcoin can change the world!!" at least three times a week, I wonder what kind of posts these people would like to see. I guess we can keep circle jerking about how great lightning network is going to be if you want.

I'll use simple, made-up numbers for this example.    
Let's say you bought 1 BTC at $100/BTC several years ago. Now, it's at $500/BTC. You withdraw $100 from your account by selling .2 BTC. This means you realized gains on .2 BTC, but the remaining .8 BTC is still invested, and the gains are therefore unrealized (and not taxable yet).
For the .2 BTC you withdrew, you compare the value of them now ($100), to the basis, which is the value of those .2 BTC at the time you invested ($20). The math looks like:
.2($500) - .2($100) = $80 of realized gain (taxable)

So you're asking me to pay tx fees just to make the merchant feel like they've made a good decision? I wanna see adoption as much as the next guy, but the volatility makes any action other than hodling look unreasonable.

I just had that problem a few weeks ago, but you can do the extra verification of your identity on coinbase (instead of through gdax) and it will unlock your gdax account. Now I just deposit money to my coinbase "USD wallet" and move everything to GDAX once it clears

Yes, but this is an echo chamber that only hypes up bitcoin and discusses its positives (which I'm fine with). Look at the news stories/clips talking about how the drop signals a bearish reversal, evidences a bubble, etc. I'm not saying those analysts are correct; I'm pretty heavily invested so I'm crossing my fingers that they're wrong. I'm just saying that you can't assume that the public consensus on reddit mirrors the public consensus everywhere else. There is a lot of FUD right now.

The content of 70% of all posts since October of last year has only just now "come to your attention?" This sub has been focused on hyping up the price for months now.
