Thank you kind sir.

Been almost 2 hours since I first noticed it... guys, any input?
@_date: 2012-08-28 13:25:02
Not really... it's a limited resource being produced at a set rate... so when demand goes up and supply is limited, what happens kiddos?

I'm having no troubles at the present.. about to buy some bonds so we'll see how it's doing.

It's up at the moment no problems for me, so it doesn't seem like you'll have to piss off your investors.  What's your offering's ticker? I'd like to check it out.

That's just it... there's a whole lot of people who are relatively confident on both sides of the fence... I've heard arguments for and against in any case. I'm not tied up in it at all, but I am waiting to buy about 50 btc till after this blows over...

That is a show I would GLADLY pay to watch.

I feel like I'm watching a high stakes coin flip.

REgardless of inside job or not, this was 100% due to the site owners negligence. In the linked forum thread he explicitly says he backed up all the keys unencrypted. He also kept close to 30k btc in a hot wallet when only a small fraction of that was being used.  Seems like he made some really bad judgement calls... and bad judgement is pretty damning in this market.

Nope. Just have some slightly diversified holdings on glbse.

Possible, but I think he's trying to manipulate those who watch the ircs... what he's trying to manipulate us into, I'm not really sure, honestly.

How so? It doesn't seem like bitcoins value is going to get much higher until the block chain is halved. Seems like he has the best opportunity to flood and make the most money right now. Now, if he does this will he take the money and run or turn around and buy in the trough before the buy orders from people waiting for him to do this come rolling in? 
@_date: 2012-08-27 14:01:57
Exactly. That list is the repayment list.  When you add that to the fact that he HAS payed a few small accounts already, but probably won't be paying all of them, it means bitlane probably isn't going to get payed jack shit.

I want you to fuck pirate too, Julian.

It was obviously said flippantly to reflect that there are points in favor of both arguments. That being said, if you've got your info, you've got your info.  Feel free to share?
@_date: 2012-08-27 14:18:47
This is about how I think it would go.

The real scary part of those irc logs to me is the last line of the last quote. "If I had all the coins just sitting around I would've had this wrapped up a long time ago."  I mean, we all knew he didn't have the funds, but this is as close to an admission of guilt as I've seen out of him.
