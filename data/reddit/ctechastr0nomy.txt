Have you ever run a server or monitored traffic off the wire? It's more difficult to hide than you believe. Secret guy is on the right track..

What was the onion hostname of the original bitcoin server he ran?

Do you actually believe he wanted bitcoin to cater to the whims of government regulation? 
Pretend you already have all the USD you can spend. You don't care about getting rich off bitcoin. Wouldn't you prefer it be used as a currency for things that Paypal and Visa won't allow?
I appreciate your opinion and offer these words for you to ponder the meaning of:
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Sorry I will be more clear. I seek a list of the host names and ip addresses  of the original bitcoin client network. I am curious where they were physically located on the earth and what carriers were used. 
I'm also interested in the migration from tor to the public network. There isn't much detail on what I'm asking for. I've looked, I'm not lazy.

They can drown the exchanges in red tape. I'm all for it. It should be an underground currency with no dollar value. This is what Satoshi Nakamoto wanted in the first place.. Many have lost their way due to greed. I bet he's rolling in his grave right now.

This is one of the things that makes bitcoin awesome! People can just close up shop and run away with money. Whats so bad about that?

"1,000,000 in 2021" per coin according to our time traveling friend. After that it will overtake the dollar as the world's reserve currency. This is going to be awesome!

I seem to remember reading he was mostly active during the daytime in US Eastern but I'm not positive. 
This is interesting:

That explains a lot. Wow. Thank you sir.

Correlation does not imply causation. This is a really weird echo chamber ya'll have built.

"his IP address on forums was checked" - Can you give me a url for more information on this?
The initial bitcoin client was acting as a server on a public network. It was not using tor. Surely someone documented the hostname and IP?
@_date: 2013-10-18 01:59:01
Its a good story so far, lots of plot twists. I'm sure it will end well.
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:39:57
Do you have any proof of that or you are just speculating?

"people only start mining blocks when there is a threat of a 51% attack" - If we don't mine, transactions don't get processed. Check out this graphic:
The bigger problem I see is when the block reward ends, who will want to mine? Some say the volume of transactions will be high and fees will be increased to make up for it but that seems overly optimistic.

It this the same guy? 
I'm new to this world but I'm not new to the world..
