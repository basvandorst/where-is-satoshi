Interesting I didn't know this was possible. Do you know what part of the transaction stores this flag?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:20:26
yes, at this difficulty rate. Difficulty doesn't have to be this high.

RBF might not be worth it because it allows for some double spending attacks on merchants that accept on 0 confirmations. However, it may be worth it because merchants really shouldn't be doing that

Yes, you are right

Lol no, they are saying high fees and volatility are not good for them:
"As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin."

Also the Tether scam

Not how 50% attack works 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:04:54
you could sell and cut losses if it drops more

Yeah you good point, if china, russia, or the US got &gt;50% hashing power they could attack bitcoin. However, they wouldn't be able to own all bitcoin. 51% attack only allows you to censor and double spend. It also increases the probability of forks, but that gets more complicated because the miners aren't the economic majority

yeah, it is near zero, sorry man. Core doesn't adopt scaling technologies effectively

I am hesitant about the lightning network. With LN, I have to either (1) make payment channels and essentially quarantine money (have it in a place where I can't use it other than for 1 purpose unless I want to close the channel) or (2) have a third party like blockstream be the payment hub, which makes the process of paying more centralized

This is possible but it is too much of a risk for me. The market seems to be getting weak. I sold most of my coin

can't wait till newbies think they fell despair at 2000
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:46:00
totally wrong. when price rises $1000+ in a couple weeks you know we are in a bubble and that it is almost time to sell.
