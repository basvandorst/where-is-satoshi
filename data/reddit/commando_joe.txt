1% of the world's energy spent on crypto mining.

Are they mining using energy off the standard energy grid that the rest of their area is using? Because that's still a net loss for green energy use if bit coining is seen as entirely optional and worth dropping to the majority of the world.

Well 'renewable' is a bit misleading at the moment, depending on where you're stationed hydro electricity is becoming less reliable due to drought or flooding.
But also the argument here wasn't to specifically change bit coin to share the renewable grid, but to try and make it independent from the grid on renewables.
If it's still pulling from the same grid as everyone else that's still a net energy loss from the main grid being redirected to bit mining.

I already said it's for currency control, didn't I?
I don't disagree that this isn't actually being done strictly for energy efficiency, I'm saying that this is being twisted that way and when it comes to trimming the fat for energy conservation crypto currency isn't going to top anyone's list of necessities.

No, it should be less.
We've got to cut down on energy use as we move forward, trim the fat.
Either get more efficient with energy use, get your asses on renewable sources or see stuff like this expand.
China's cracking down on currency control, but this sort of moral spin is going to get support as long as energy is wasted on what most people see as a wasteful endeavor. Not a popular opinion on this subject for this sub, I'm sure, but everyone here has to know no one's going to shed a tear in the general population over saving energy by cutting out bit mining.

Yeah, good idea.
