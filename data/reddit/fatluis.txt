He looks brainwashed.

The reason you know this is fake is because he honestly believes the government will keep his identity secret.

The whole IoT could be the thing that breaks the Chinese monopoly on mining some day.  Id be curious what kind of total hashpower could be generated from very small, lower power computers being installed in every toaster, TV, Microwave, smartphone etc.

I hope a ton of miners do switch over.  Mine a ton of low diff coins and flood the market, make the coin worthless even more quickly.

They have a stranglehold on the ASIC market.  Miners don't have other options.

You've had a long, hard day galloping around the internet putting out fires for your superiors.  Go have a nice long drink in your trough and take a break.  *Gives horse blanket and pats you on the head*

Obvious astroturfing is obvious.

I have little doubt Bitmain is underwritten by the PRC.  I remember a quote from the owner of KNC a while back saying they could not come up with any economic model that could explain how Bitmain made any money from selling miners.  China views BTC and all cryptos as a threat to their ability to manipulate currency.  The empire of Bitmain, underwritten by the government, has given Chinese leaders some measure of control concerning the control of Bitcoin.  BCC is one of many attempts by them to take full control of the coin.

The amount of astro turfing on this sub reddit is absolutely nuts.  Logical fallacies everywhere, and no one calls them out because seemingly 90% of posters on this sub are paid employees of SegWit2.  The fact that this sub is carpeted like this is proof enough to me that the coin is dead.  Whoever is behind it, Chinese or USA governments, Jihan..whoever it doesn't really matter.  The coin has been compromised.  Its going to be controlled by a small group of people.  It will not be anonymous.  The majority of the world won't care in the slightest.

This community is such trash.  Maybe Bitcoin dying isn't such a bad thing after all.

They have to have 'Bitcoin' somewhere in the name in order to continue the false narrative that this soon to be irrelevant altcoin is the 'True Bitcoin^(TM)".

HODL is a term used by people who have some long term 'mental discounts'.  More important than the future of BTC is the goal is banishing this word from humanity.

Yes, rest.  There are yet still those out there who doubt the greatness of Segwit2.  You have many minds still ahead of you to convert.  I am pleased to see however that you have summoned the help of your other animal friends, notable among them is the mighty red herring.  With these allies by your side you will yet succeed, young Padawan.

private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.
Maybe someone can help make this clearer.  If funds are moved to a new Electrum wallet, leaving the old wallet with a balance of zero, then wouldn't moving the old wallet keys to BCC result in a balance of zero BCC as well?  Wouldn't you have to import the keys from the wallet with your actual balance in order to get a equal amount of BCC?

If you read it it seems they are going after him for illegal drug sales and trying to hide the profit, not simply for using Bitcoin.
