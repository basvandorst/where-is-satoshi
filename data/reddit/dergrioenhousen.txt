I try to keep a long mentality on Bitcoin. I really don’t pay much mind to the price. I keep buying, keep mining, and will pay heed in 10-15 years.
Of course I keep up with the technical and the price as a matter of indicators of health, but none of it bothers me. Less cost equals the more I can get at a time, which makes me a happy, considering how long I am on it.
If I was a day-trader, I’d be sick to my stomach right now.
I just want it usable, adopted, and the fees to drop back to where they were in 2013. This is a bit disgusting as of late. I do everything I can to not move anything, but will be setting up a Segwit address soon to sweep everything into, but I have all the work to do with the hardware keys, backing up all the private keys, and I’m just not sold on Segwit off-chain magic bullet.
But, we’ll see. I’ll play along and test as I’m more comfortable.

Hopefully. I was expecting, for example, Litecoin, to gain to $100 by the end of 2018. I didn’t expect the giant rocket up, and knew there was no sustaining it. I wasn’t sure about Bitcoin, but that market is willed by folks who *wanted* 20K, and seems like, from a brief analysis of what happened to get it, there was a ton of wash trading and arbitrage to get it, with a dump and drop to buy up more. So, the waves continue to crash, and we’re just low-tide.
Maybe I’m wrong.

Perfect. Thank you for rounding the picture out for me.
Now, another one I'm trying to understand: how do all the exchanges stay the same price within a few percentage points with each currency?
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:14:52
I hate to be the n00b here and ask this, but I'm not sure I understand why. I currently run Core. Should I just shut it down and move all the files elsewhere... or?
Just trying to keep this straight and understand the implications. I apologize if this has been related somewhere ad nauseum and I've just missed it.

Is there a better term to use than 'price parity' when referring to this particular aspect of trading?
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:53:25
As someone who doesn't fully understand hardware wallets: how?
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:08:19
About 30 minutes after they've sold all the BCC they're going to get by not giving it to the idiots housing their tokens on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:28:08
Ahhh, yes. That I knew. I just haven't gotten one in my hands yet to use, though it's on my list. 
Can I ask a last question I can't seem to find a solid answer to? Does a single Trezor/Nano/etc support multiple wallets? I'm looking for a single hardware device that can allow for a multitude of coins, and again, I hate to even ask if it's been covered somewhere and I'm just not finding the answer. I'm a hardcore proponent of "Google it," I just can't find an absolute 'yes' or 'no.' It seems anomalous, and I want to make sure I spend my money on what I want, not what I think I want.

So I do understand it more than I realize. 
Just unsure, and if I'm dropping a couple hundred bucks, I want to make sure I'm getting what I want/need.
Thank you for the replies. Very much appreciated.

I'd heard the term before, but never got the practical explanation. Thank you; that's a lot clearer now. Arbitrage will also bring prices into parity as the offerings meet up then, as I'm starting to understand?

I am. Just takes the same amount of time as Coinbase as the same bank processes ACH transactions for CB and GDAX. One day I had an instant transfer for hardly nothing ($50), and then another three transfer for the same a week or so on later took five days.

OK, that hit the nail on the head for me. 
As someone who has recently spun up some ASICs, the sounds of the fans humming in the basement is money being made. I stopped for a moment and thought "Yeah, that's a good sound."
Thanks for the chuckle.

Under the premise that the poster above you operates on, I've literally lost, speculating, of course, hundreds of thousands of dollars, if I'd have simply held. But I sold at various times for various reasons because I needed the money for various things, or tried to catch a market at a peek, and it kept going. 
So you can have no regrets when you sell, only that you've pulled a profit. The actual amount of profit doesn't exist until the 'Sell' order goes through. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:30:45
Some people have instant ACH transfers and some do not. I've been waiting for that magic day when mine became instant, and I've yet to get it. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:47:52
I just want to say a big "thank you!" for that. I was going to open an account and add some BTC today, but I'll hold off until this is sorted out.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:40:45
That was the laugh I was looking for this morning. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:18:57
American Psycho.

I've always been curious how all the sites sync up valuation.
Any insight into that?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:46:03
I just wanted to say 'thank you' for starting me investigating with that simple reply. I'm a bit obsessed at the moment, but I've got so many more questions I can't begin to reconcile without, I suspect, a degree in finance. 
My curiosity is outrunning my capacity to find answers that make sense. There's just so much information to wade through, and I don't know what I don't know. 
I almost feel like I just need to throw some money in and ride the wave, but, just, for example, staring at GDAX as it bounces around: I *just* don't understand what's influencing market movement up or down, and I'm frustrated. 
Any books or reading you might send me towards to start getting a base more than "Oh, cryptocurrencies look interesting?"
