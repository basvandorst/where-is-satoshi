Here people are taking bitcoin wrong they just want the profit, over 90% of the people i have met who hold bitcoin doesn’t know the core technology and it’s shameful.

Good guy.

I would buy more crypto with the profit rather than spending.

I am using it since Jambo made the bot.
How I buy using his bot:
I buy keys from local friends in cheap and then sell the keys to bot for bitcoins.
I am a Hodler

As far as I am making money �� I don’t mind others making money from me.

The hate for these fraudulent banks can be seen on this guys face and also this whole bitcoin community.

Its so easy for Microsoft to make their own bitcoin payment gateway.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:24:27
I think Microsoft should collaborate and develop something with Goldman Sachs as they are also so passionate about Bitcoin.
I think it would just take 2-3 weeks for them to create something that this community loves.

They could have become the Hodler like us and post something about hodling on @_date: 2017-10-04 07:28:58
I don’t think that this will happen under Satya Nadella’s leadership or as long as Bill Gates is Alive.
