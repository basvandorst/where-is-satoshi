It's supposed to become a currency though, right? Why would you exchange it if you can buy your house in straight crypto.

Fork coin? Are you talking about BCH?

Why is saturated with posts like this? Too mainstream or something?

My guy, the "actual numerous customers" have no idea what Segwit or the Lightning Network even are. If nobody fights for it then Coinbase will delay the issue until the average user realizes how shit Coinbase is without these improvements and the great sell off occurs.

That's not what he's talking about. If you hold for over a year it becomes a long term capital gain which is taxed at 20% at the highest bracket instead of being taxed as ordinary income (at 39.6% or 37%).

If you don't think that eventually people will realize what they've bought into when they purchased BTC on Coinbase then you're ignorant. BTC can't be used as a currency, Coinbase doesn't seem to care, and eventually this will come to bite them.
You're right in saying that Coinbase is a business. A business that makes the majority of its money by trading an unusable currency while ignoring the fact that it's unusable. We're not talking about BCH or XRP or XMR or any other currency that works better, we're talking about the behemoth. I don't care honestly if they specifically employ SegWit or LN, but I do care that if they do nothing then they will bring about their doom.
Also, happiness is a dumb factor to focus on. If they just want to make everyone happy they could operate at a loss like Twitter. It's not about happiness, it's about money and the future of the technology.
EDIT: Looking back, are you arguing that SegWit won't decrease fees?

Did you read the page you linked? The whole thing is an argument that Bitcoin will not be affected by the deflationary spiral. 
In the introduction: 


Then later there is a whole section explaining how BTC will not be affected.
