Don't worry, I'm sure some Chinese or Russians will eventually decide to make more money off of your ponzi scheme again in the future and when they do the price will rise again! 
@_date: 2018-10-08 23:17:29
Haha it's funny because the lack of regulation is exactly why shifty people from questionable countries have essentially turned bitcoin into a glorified ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:51:51
And I think that it is heavily overvalued as is on account of all the hype created by posts like this one as more and more people buy it with the intention of profiting from their bitcoins rather than using them as a currency. Each to their own I guess :p 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:26:41


Nobody uses bitcoin as a currency though. Everyone is treating it like a penny stock that exploded and I'd be very surprised if more than a small percentage of bitcoin owners used them the way that regular money gets used. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:32:57
Depends if all the money launderers plan to cash out before it gets to 10k or not ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:13:54


Right, and that's what is known as a speculative bubble. As your video rightly points out, "nobody is even using bitcoin yet" which is precisely why it's so dangerous. Most people are buying bitcoin with the expectation of making a profit from their purchase, not to use them as a medium of exchange as currencies are traditionally used. So that means that when people decide to start selling that the price has to come back down. It's really just a matter of when that is going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:53:47
No, Apple shares have actual tangible value and represent stock in a physical company. Bitcoin are literally intangible in the sense that they're virtual and only represent whatever shmucks are willing to pay for them. 
It's a great concept for the record, it's just that there's so many people buying bitcoin with the expectation that they'll get rich that it's become a massive game of chicken, so instead of acting as a stable currency, the price keeps rising as more idealistic folks buy in, with the hope that the price will keep rising. Unfortunately, that's not sustainable so if you own any bitcoin I'd suggest you consider cashing in sooner rather than later because when it crashes, it's going to be a doozy this time :P
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:00:16
Lol, I love how the go-to retort is always "jealousy". Well yeah, I'm also jealous of folks who win the lottery but it doesn't mean I'm going to run out and buy lottery tickets. If I'm wrong about bitcoin then I don't lose anything, but if I'm right then the suicide hotline gets stickied to the top of this subreddit, again.
So watch who you go around calling "stupid" since your devout faith in bitcoin means that you'll probably be one of first ones using that hotline at the first sign of a crash :) 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:50:30
Depends if everyone else thinks the same thing or not. I think everyone's playing a game of chicken with each other at this point, anticipating that next "dip" everyone is ranting and raving about being right around the corner. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:10:02
Yeah, so it's kinda cute when people on this subreddit talk about "selling before the next dip" since the current value of BTC is simply indicative of how much wealth is currently stored within the currency. As soon as people start to sell the price will start to drop but nobody wants to sell yet because everyone is expecting the price to go higher.
It's essentially turned into one big game of chicken ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Don't get me wrong, I want bitcoin to succeed, but "it will do well because people hope it will do well" is a really dangerous reason for people to invest in it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:11:44
Well I hope I'm wrong for your sake and the sake of many others, but I'm not convinced that people with money aren't influencing the price which in turn drives speculation and has driven the price much higher than it's true equilibrium value. For many folks, the lack of regulation is what makes bitcoin so enticing, but it's the lack of regulation which frightens me. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:05:44
Or maybe it will one day turn out that I understood bitcoin better than you do ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
The whole point is that nobody knows until it happens, and the most fundamental tenant of any form of investing is that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Many people are investing in bitcoin simply because they expect the price to rise in the future so that they can profit, and that's the wrong reason to invest in bitcoin. That's what creates a speculative bubble, and if this speculation pushes the price above the true market value, then anyone who doesn't get out before the crash happens is ultimately going to lose a lot of money. 
I'm not saying that I'm right, I'm just saying that it might be a possible reason as to why the price of bitcoin is so volatile right now. If I'm wrong then I lose nothing because I chose not to invest, and I'm totally okay with that. It'll be great if bitcoin does end up succeeding though which is precisely why I'm in this subreddit, it's fun to follow the happenings!
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:45:53


Unless you live in Zimbabwe or some other country with an incredibly unstable currency then that simply isn't true. 
But as long as you are in a situation where you have your investments diversified and aren't just dumping everything into bitcoin. I remember a few years back when there was a major crash that there was a news article about some guy who lost all the college money that his parents gave him when the bitcoin market crashed and tried to kill himself. Hell, every time the value starts to dip the mods here sticky the suicide hotline to the top of the subreddit.
I'm not suggesting that you are suicidal of course, but from one stranger to another, the grass currently seems much greener on the side that we're on right now because the price is still seemingly rising. So just take care of yourself and don't allow yourself to be in a position where your life could be ruined if the bitcoin market does end up crashing in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:15:07

Well yeah, just like I'm jelly of people who are lucky enough to go all in on the roulette table and come out on top, doesn't make me any more inclined when it comes to taking dumb risks though :p 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:07:28
Well technically you didn't lose over a million in BTC because BTC wasn't worth that much when you spent it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:45:11
The problem with that is that because it's incredibly volatile, it is risky to store large amounts of wealth in bitcoin and so it currently fails to perform reliably as a currency.
 To put it simply, I wouldn't be happy to wake up tomorrow and discover that my life savings had suddenly halved overnight. Volatility is very bad for currencies and there isn't even a whole lot you can even use bitcoin to buy at the moment, so buying it right now with the hope that we'd be "tight" in the future is a pretty risky decision to make. 
It basically reminds me of that scene from the Simpsons where they visit krustyland and homer buys krustyland dollars because they're more "fun" than regular money, only to discover that he can't actually use them for anything. That's how I feel about bitcoin right now, and if a day comes where they are accepted by your local supermarket then you'll be laughing all the way to the bitcoin bank.  But I'm not personally convinced that this is something that is going to happen anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:35:57
Because if something happens to bitcoin (I'm not saying it will, but if it does) then you're going to be incredibly fucked when you lose all your savings. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:27:30
Lol, telling people to buy something just so the price goes higher is literally the definition of a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:51:51
I completely agree that the banks fucked up, and many governments (especially the U.S one) heavily fucked up because they refused to regulate their banks properly. 
I'm in Australia and we were actually very fortunate at the time of the GFC because we had a progressive government in office at the time that was able to react quickly and implement policy to soften the blow from the recession.
The problem I have with bitcoin is everyone is always talking about the supply side of things (you know the lines about how "governments can print as much money as they want" and other bullshit like that) but I really don't see people talking about the impact that demand has on the price of bitcoin at the moment. The amount of speculation happening at the moment is absolutely insane and I think it's a fair assumption to make that many people are buying in without thoroughly researching bitcoin (or the basics of financial investment for that matter).  
I've even noticed people in my facebook contacts promoting bitcoin and encouraging people to buy them. The price can't keep going up forever and when it begins to plateau people are going to start selling because the majority of bitcoin holders don't give a fuck about using bitcoin as a currency, they have bought bitcoin because they want to profit from the decision. And the only way for people to realise that profit is to sell the bitcoins that they currently hold. 
So keeping all that in mind, I honestly feel that at some time in the future that it is very possible that bitcoin will become a toxic asset. Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) have an incredible amount of potential, but if a major crash does happen then there's a good chance that it'll shake everyone's confidence and seriously hinder bitcoin's ability to experience growth on the scale that it is currently occurring.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:57:31
Well I can tell you a reason people don't invest in it: To buy stuff, because basically nowhere accepts them as a form of payment ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:28:50


But the purpose of money is to provide a stable medium for storing wealth, which is literally the complete opposite of what bitcoin is right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:01:20
See the other comments mate, no point repeating myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:28:20
Yeah, but some risks are greater than others, hence my gambling analogy. Surely a smart guy like yourself who goes around calling other people idiots already knew that though :\^)
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:51:46
But the million dollar question is whether or not we've yet passed the peak price yet. If we have then everyone who buys past that point will essentially lose money. Some people are saying that they could be worth as much as $100,000US one day, and there are others who believe the price will go even higher than that. But we don't know and past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:03:43
Yeah but then the Chinese and Russians wouldn't be able to soak them all up and force the price up in order to lull people into also buying them ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:26:33
Your way of thinking is flawed because you are using hindsight to criticise a decision that was made based on the information that was available to him at the time. 
The opposite could also potentially happen, if there was a massive crash tomorrow (I'm not saying there will be, but if there was) and the price plummeted then everyone would be saying "I wish I had sold my coins before the price plummeted!". Obviously nobody is expecting the price to plummet so nobody is selling off their coins at the moment. Likewise, he (and the majority of others) weren't expecting the price to rise so that's why you hear all these stories about people gambling their coins away or using thousands of them to buy a pizza.
Also if you want to be pedantic, you also had the opportunity to win the lottery last week. An extremely marginal chance, but a chance nonetheless :P 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:23:11
If that's true then that's an extremely foolish thing to do with any form of investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:03:05


Except people generally don't buy currency with the intent of profiting off of their purchase. 
Also your "argument" about value can be applied to literally anything and everything in existence. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:31:56


Yes, because there is a high degree of risk associated with investing in bitcoin, so investors make a high return for taking the gamble. 
A lot of people in this subreddit don't seem to realise this incredibly fundamental point when it comes to bitcoins or any other form of investment. 
I know plenty of internet folks enjoy the "fuck the establishment" line of thinking, but if you put your money into a bank then that money is going to be there when you return for it. It's really that simple, and if you have a problem with the larger banks then there are plenty of credit unions out there to choose from.

Well ultimately they are only worth as much as people are willing to pay for them and naturally people are willing to pay more when they think the price is going to rise in the future. The issue arises if everyone collectively starts to panic which could very easily happen. It's happened multiple times in the past as you've mentioned and it may or may not happen again. But obviously if someone jumps into the market and buys a few coins for 9 grand a piece, it'd be really shitty for them if the price then dropped back down to 7 grand and then that's the value where the market reached stability.

That's a valid point, however the issue with your comparison is that the tycoons started buying up the oil once it became understood that it could be used to fuel transport and industry. We still aren't sure if bitcoin being used for a large number of people for their day-to-day transactions will become a reality yet so the current market value of ~9700 is purely speculative. 
At the time oil was discovered, it wasn't easily substitutable but anyone with the right programming knowledge can create a cryptocurrency so there's no guarantee that bitcoin will always remain the standard. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:06:34
That's assuming of course that you're able to cash out before everyone else does ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:40:10
Yes, because 401s are generally based on sustainable, low risk investments, whereas with BTC you were able to enter a ponzi scheme on the ground floor and have subsequently been rewarded for it. 
But this post is on r/all now, and so it'll probably encourage others to buy into bitcoin, raising the price further for you and the other early adopters at their expense, so congrats I guess :P 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:04:51
It's more complicated than that, but essentially the supply in circulation is controlled by the feds and it's one of the ways they attempt to smooth out the economic cycle. If a reserve bank just starts dumping currency into an economy, it can cause massive inflation so that's why it generally isn't done. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:42:09


Exactly, which brings this post's authenticity into question since OP is probably shoveling the idea of bitcoin down her throat.
It's the equivalent of if you told a kid that "E=MC^2 " and then when they repeated it you started bragging about how they understand mass energy equivalence. It doesn't count if they're just mimicking you. 
OP is just using their kid as a magnet for attention, which is a pretty shitty thing to do.

Yes but the implication is that when the banks have issues, the fed 'prints money' in order to bail them out. That was the context of this shitty demotivational meme back in 2010 or whenever it first started circulating. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:44:38
Lol @ all the fucking armchair experts who pretend that they have any clue what they're talking about. A "dip" is a pretty big understatement considering the value has fallen 12 grand in less than a month. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:02:25
It's a massive circlejerk about how "banks literally print their own money" and how some people legitimately believe that bitcoin is the holy grail answer to all the financial issues in the world. Cryptocurrencies are neat, but posts like this one are stupid and create a bad impression. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:19:28
See, even that mindset is a little risky. It's gone up like 2k over the course of the month and that's volatile as fuck, and precisely the kind of shit that puts me off buying into the market. If it can move in one direction that quickly, it can just as easily move in the other direction too. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:10:09

@_date: 2017-10-13 05:57:31
A "speculative bubble" to be precise!
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:53:08
No offense but that is incorrect. It might gone stable in the past, but that stability has brought back many optimistic folks like you which has paradoxically caused it to become unstable again. As I mentioned before, jumping 2 grand in less than a month per coin is anything but stable. It might not be an inherent problem to bitcoin, but nobody was arguing that it was. You can shit on the U.S dollar if you like, but there's a reason that it's used as a world standard when pricing other assets, because it is a historically stable currency (and I say that as a non-American). If the value of U.S dollars shot up by such a high magnitude comparable to how bitcoin has recently performed (relative to the majority of other currencies out there), everyone would be absolutely freaking out, because currencies are not supposed to do that. 
The only possible way that it can happen is if an asset or currency is undervalued. But the issue is that as the price rises to reach the new equilibrium, it can easily overshoot it creating a false vacuum situation which becomes dangerous to everyone who enters the market after the point that the price rises above what the natural equilibrium should be.
It's horrible to say, but the last time there was a massive crash the mods of this subreddit had to sticky the suicide hotline because of all the chaos that ensued. People got confident, and while nobody wants to admit that it could happen again, there's a very real possibility that it could. 
If you think the price will settle at a point higher than where it currently is, then go nuts and invest away. But don't fall into the trap of not acknowledging the reality which is that your guess is as good as anyone else's. There is no certainty in what's going to happen to it's future price and that's why bitcoin is not a safe medium to store value in at present.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:14:34
But the value of each coin can be manipulated by controlling the buying and selling of large sums of coins in order to encourage other sellers to follow suit as they notice the market begin to fluctuate. 
Of course this can also be done with conventional currencies, but because bitcoins aren't regulated (which tbf is a selling point for some people) there isn't really anyone to stop people from manipulating the price to their own benefit. 
So the fact that there are a finite number of bitcoins out isn't really as much as an advantage as some people seem to try and argue. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:36:54
Sure, or tomorrow the bitcoin market could crash and everyone who has invested could potentially lose a lot of money. It's important to remember that any profit you make comes at the cost of assuming risk by investing into bitcoin in the first place.

I think speculation plays a big part :p Check out the comments in this thread alone, bunch of IT folks and computer enthusiasts getting excited and dumping their savings into BTC which causes the price to keep rising. The moment people start getting spooked that the price isn't going to go any higher, they'll start panicking and selling and the price will collapse pretty quickly.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:33:01
That's good to hear. Hopefully I'm wrong and everybody else here is right, but it doesn't hurt to be a little risk averse just in case. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:33:57
Lol no, it's a terrible store of value! At least right now at its current state of volatility The price this month alone has gone up $2000 U.S, and that's actually really really bad for the purposes of storing value. Great for increasing value if you're a risk taking investor but as I said earlier in this thread, (it might have been to someone else, I can't remember) if it can go up that quickly in one direction, it can go just as quickly in the other.
I think the issue that you and many others keen on bitcoin have is that when you say "it has controlled supply", you aren't taking into account that it's the demand that creates the source of volatility. Right now people are buying in because they expect the value to rise, and that creates speculation. 
There are a bunch of statements around this subreddit that say stuff like "I'm going to wait until the market dips before I buy back in" or "I'm going to sell just before the next dip is", everyone is playing against each other and that makes bitcoin a very dangerous investment right now. Someone could dump their bank savings into them tonight (I'm sure most people aren't that silly of course) and lose halve of those savings a week from now and never get them back, because the market reached a point of equilibrium below where it's at now. 
Many bitcoin proponents are betting on the fact that the state of equilibrium is going to rise significantly higher than the current market value, but there is also a real possibility that current levels of speculation have caused bitcoin to become an overvalued asset. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:32:43
