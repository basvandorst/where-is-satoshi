Just copying the files is not enough since that wouldn't include all the partitions and filesystem information etc. which is neccesary. Please use the guide I linked in my first post -- or any other tutorial which explains how to make a 1 to 1 copy of the SD card which results in a single image.

Well, they did a blog post about it: [ \-- but that doesn't mean they provide a useful all-in-one image of the SD card, currently they just provide several single applications without any tutorial on how to get everything working from scratch on a fresh Raspbian.

Remove the top cover and then the small plastic plate on the side. Now you can just pull the microSD card out (with older Raspberry Pi models you had to push the card to release, but the Raspberry Pi 3 changed that to just pull). Tweezers might help :)

I don't get it. We are still kind of early in Bitcoin adoption. How on earth does a company like Spot9 think it is a good idea to start their (vaporware) business fightning/attacking other Bitcoin businesses and individuals who value the open, public, borderless, neutral, and censorship resistant aspects of Bitcoin? In other countries like Switzerland and Austria Bitcoin ATMs can be used anonymously without KYC as it should be. I really don't think attacking privacy minded Bitcoin users and businesses will be a successful business strategy in this space...

Hi, this would be awesome, yes! Torrent would be great, but I'll accept any way to get the file :)
According to [ you have to unlock LND after each reboot of the casa through the webinterface, so there is no auto unlock of LND in the casa node.

Because BIP39 (Mnemonic seeds) is not a perfect way to backup your keys: no version can be specified, no birthdate is included, it uses a kind of weak key derivation function, doesn't specify the derivation path, allows for different languages of the wordlist but uses the words to calculate the checksum, if the user enters two variations of a passphrase by accident it is confusing to have different addresses/keys etc.
Bitcoin Core for example doesn't implement BIP39 either. Electrum created their own mnemonic seed version (actually two different ones). And LND as well created their own aezeed mnemonic seed backup scheme because of the flaws of BIP39.
The Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach does however create BIP32 (Hierarchical deterministic) wallets so it is not the keys which you backup with the file but the way to generate those keys just like any other wallet. 
I still like it as it has no central server, supports sending+receiving bech32 addresses, NFC, has reproducible builds...

[ the quality of this one is fine to print it in DIN-A1 format
