I'd advise against using bots that you have no personally written yourself, in any financial market.
This guide was intended as an introduction to crypto for someone who has never bought a bitcoin.
Hoping to see what people are looking for when starting their own crypto journey.

Definitely - if pro sports starts to adopt cryptos, uptake worldwide is going to be ALOT faster than we think - lets hope

If you take a moment to explore the hub Bill, you'll find some pretty interesting original pieces.
Hopefully we don't all jump to conclusions too quickly.
It's not a very good thing for the crypto community. 
No worries. 
Original content can be found throughout the hub.
Cryptonicles is a curation of both publicly available content and content created by our community.
For example, this is something I wrote to help people learn more about Bitcoin.
If you would like to share anything to the hub, feel free, all are welcome to submit their thoughts.
Thanks for taking the time to let me know your concern. It really helps, I am new to Reddit.
If you get a chance to join the Cryptonicles community, I would be interested to know your position on Bitcoin. 
The conversation is heating up this year!
Hope this helps clear things up.
