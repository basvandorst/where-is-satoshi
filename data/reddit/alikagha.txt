Where is this chart from? Can you explain more? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:35:12
Why do you say that? Just wondering.
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:03:25
In your opinion is there any compromise that can be made at this point to avoid a hardfork?

Bro get off this guys ass. Would a doctor giving very general advice on Reddit have to disclose his practice just to mention the fact the he is indeed a doctor.

I recommend a paper wallet. You should never keep your coin on an exchange for an extended period of time.

Preach!!! CHURCH!!!

Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. This kind of talk scares the shit out of me. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:22:08
Remember me? I understand what your saying. and I agree. I have had to learn this the hard way. Whenever I have made an impulsive decision when it comes to investing I have lost. The human mind has been conditioned over generations to run at the slightest sign of danger. In terms of bitcoin, anyone who has run in fear of "bitcoin" dyeing has been proven wrong.

Sure! breadwallet.com is great. Your going to download breadwallet(or any other wallet you choose) to your phone and transfer your bitcoin to the wallet. The most important thing about a wallet is keeping your back up phrase safe. Write it down. If you ever lose your phone worry not because you can recover your funds using that phrase. This way your money is yours and safe, no need for a third party. This is the beauty of cryptocurrency. Enjoy!

I read this post as a rhyme. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:20:43
Exactly, please show this to all BU supporters. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:59:24
I understand core is far less centralized then BU supporters are trying to sell. The point of the post was to spur prominent Core devs and supporters to reach out to the opposition. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:44:22
Good Question. Does anyone have a place we can find out as soon as it happens. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 23:57:01
Hey safe is this? And how longs does it take to receive the package? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:38:10
This? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:58:29
Exactly, talked with vinny and his advice was sell. Check out  tweet. This is just getting started. Ver + McAffe + Chinese Minors are going to try to monopolize the system. Check this quote out from  "Forking at 80% isn't that hard when you've built a facility that would give you 75% over night:". That's what we are up against.

"The toxicity around here is real."
FUCK YOU FIAT SHILL!! jk, you're totally right. :)
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:45:00
Explain more 
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:18:04
Please continue to elaborate. Assuming the thesis of the Bitcoin/Yuan correlation is true, do you expect the yuan to rally? 
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:15:08
What investments are you making that consistently make 20%? Just wondering. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:14:14
When will the every user be able to do this? 
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:34:21
LTC has identical characteristics of BTC but an added layer of software with Segwit + LN. The only downside is a lack of dev support and diversified mineer supoort but these things will change with time. Many of the current BTC apps and wallets can be transferred over quite easily. I don't see any fundamental weaknesses with LTC. I would love to hear other thoughts.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:33:27
Please go into detail. ELI5
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:38:07
Posts like this terrify me. You can't get this general of investment advice from Reddit. You should be educated enough before investing and asking BTC or LTC. PLEASE go look into the differences between the two and the current states of development and then decide for yourself. And the price drops you mentioned are NOTHING, if that scares you from investing you are just following the price fluctuations. That is not investing. That's gambling. Develop a thesis and establish fundimentals to back it up then invest. If you need help getting up to speed I am more then happy to help. Good luck.

LMAO troll level 1000% ��

It's a lot like the Trump effect. They want someone who makes extraordinary claims. Someone who tells the other side to "fuck off". Amazing that this has become a popular archetype in society. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:57:02
Can you explain how this might happen. How exactly can and will the UASF fail? Not enough info on this. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:36:10
This is a great qoute.
