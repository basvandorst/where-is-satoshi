Missing the point entirely....focus on the long term.

Use the console, “listunspent” to get a list of your inputs or “coins”, at each address
For each address export private key, put into electron cash.
No easy way, unless you do a full wallet private key dump.  Not sure if that is still supported

But this one is going to be epic.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:24:29
I’m sure it can get more lame
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:39:49
BCH is the change 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:02:40
It gets hard forked Monday, and upgraded.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:48:28
You wait 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:26:08
Exactly. At this rate it will never be done 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:55:47
Do you have an 1337 BTC limit per day acct?  
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:50:21
Wake up dude
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:05:14
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:51:50
Bitcoin is BCH
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:13:09
I found that to be very sketchy, and moved everything out because of that.  Plus tech-support and no one on the slack would comment about it
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:25:02
They know dogecoin 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:18:37
Short term correction, profit taking, its healthy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:55:14
Seems so easy...emotions are a powerful drug
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:09:41
Fuck, if you don’t know who he is, you shouldn’t own Bitcoin.  Sign we are in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:55:10
?  Proof of stake rewards those with capital 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:36:39
Price always changes due to supply and demand. The DARI is showing hash power is moving, and it makes sense, as cash is fundamentally closer to an original bitcoin with no block limit.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:17:30
It’s called Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:23:12
Txn confirmation is pretty healthy...
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:48:54
Remind me in five years
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:41:30
It's called Bitcoin CASH
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:33:47
Only if you want to sell the real Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:26:02
I.e., why Bitcoin Cash frees us from this Segwit world of bullshit.  Segwit came with both technical debt and political debt.  Currently seeing the effects of the latter.

These are op_codes and 52 is just the most appropriate available code at the time this feature was added
See OP_2-OP_16 here
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:20:49
You are the greater fool in this txn, you just don't know it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:53:18
This one time, Bitcoin crashed...
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:41:13
It does
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:34:19
I think you have that backwards.
