This chart is a bit misleading, since there have been numerous banks created to replace banks that merge with other banks. Any industry will consolidate when plotted in this manner.

$130 M per day is $47 B per year, which is quite a large number. I can't find any statistics on how much California spends on electricity, but here's a number for comparison: General Electric posted revenues of $142 B in 2013.

In terms of exponential growth, there isn't much difference between "virtually zero" and "mass adoption".
The Bitcoin economy will have to expand 200 times over to reach $100000. When Mt. Gox opened in July 2010, prices were $0.05 per BTC. There were maybe 250 Bitcoiners then. Extrapolation gives us 2000000 Bitcoiners now, which seems reasonable. For another 200-fold expansion, we would need 400 million Bitcoiners.
Much before that mark, we'd run into serious slowdowns in growth. First we'd saturate the population of technologically-inclined people. Soon after, we'd saturate the population of social left and economic rights. Then we'd saturate the population of young people in the developed world.
Bitcoin is bigger than we like to think. If we are at 0.5% of our target audience, then we have almost reached the target audience, based on exponential growth.
An interesting analogy is that of bacteria: say that the carrying capacity of a Petri dish is one trillion bacteria. If bacteria double every 20 minutes, and the dish is currently 0.1% full, how long will it take to fill the Petri dish assuming exponential growth? 200 minutes is all it takes! Of course, the bacteria will begin to reproduce more slowly long before it reaches the carrying capacity.
Bitcoin's growth is already on the cusp of slowing down. Exponential growth can't continue forever.

Technical indicators have proven to work well in traditional markets. It's not tarot card or astrology.
We don't really know *why* most technical indicators work, but they seem to do. When Darwin proposed evolution, we didn't know *why* it happened—but the evidence supported it happening.
People, and by extension markets, are complicated. It'll take a long time to figure out what fundamental principles cause markets to behave as they do. But it seems they follow a certain pattern, even if we don't know why they follow that pattern.

We're eventually going to need more decimal places though. It'd be a shame if the term "satoshi" got used as an actual unit of account, since it's so useful for referring to the lowest denomination of Bitcoin. If people use it in commerce, we'd have to invent another term for the lowest denomination...

If $360 M (3600 bitcoins at $100000 each) is mined every day, then miners will up their operations until $360 M per day is spent on mining—that's how perfect competition works. Not all of this will be electricity, but it's conceivable that a significant part will be, say $100 M. It costs approximately $0.10 for one kWh, so that's 1 TWh used per day, which is 1.8% of global power consumption. I'm not sure how much electricity California uses, but I would expect it to not be far off from 1% of global electricity, which means aesu's numbers are approximately correct.
Luckily for us, the block reward should halve at least twice more before we reach $100000 (I'm not buying the "continued exponential growth at current rate" argument; growth is going to slow down), so these numbers are moot.

You are correct. I significantly underestimated the electrical consumption of California. The point still remains, however, that it is impractical for the price to reach $100000 before the next halving.

ALLEGED pedophile. Not even taken to criminal court. What problem do we even have with him?
