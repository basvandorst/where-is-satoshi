Yeah mate you are right. Not one of us has ever used a credit card to buy anything over the internet, ever. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:45:11
Then why are you taking it so personally? :)
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:43:21


So, its bad and it concerned you. 
So you then not only got your girlfriend to do the same thing, but even after she had given away all her details away for nothing, got ANOTHER friend of yours to do the same thing too?!?!
What's wrong with you?!
@_date: 2014-12-06 03:35:46
This is someone who was posting on other forums looking for small loans. The $60 in tips is probably worth quite a lot to this guy. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:34:44
Okay. So then what about the other steps?
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:15:17
Uh, I think it was, unless you were living on a farm in the middle of nowhere. 
But presumably you were born after 1995 so you probably wouldn't know anyway. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:52:58
This makes sense and is something I hadn't thought about too much. 
I'm still not convinced that would mean its necessary to use the Bitcoin blockchain, when they could otherwise just create another one for the specific election (or whatever). But its a good point and worth remembering, cheers.
@_date: 2014-10-29 05:10:26
Because bitcoin makes up no part of the world economy and is completely irrelevant. There are not many reasons it should track the stock market closely. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:10:43
I see. Well then consider me enlightened, I'm glad I had the opportunity to speak to someone important!
@_date: 2014-12-21 05:27:55
Although it might be "one guy's experience" it just happens to be THE relevant guy. The OP of this thread is the same as the OP of that thread. Rub3X said he would get 0 sales and he was right.

I'm not saying it happens *often*. But with Bitcoin, once is enough, everything is gone forever.

They have mate. Its the only reason I love reading this forum, comedy gold!
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:37:09
Not sure if I'm reading this correctly. 
Do you think trading $10m is going to affect the USD exchange rate? (with any other pair). 
If you do you have no idea how liquid the currency exchange markets are. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:57:12
I appreciate the thoughtout reply, thanks. 
For what its worth, I don't think there is anything evil with the fractional banking system. Money sat in an account doing nothing would be better used funding other investments, and at least the banking infrastructure does provide that. Its not perfect but I do think better than the alternative. 
But definitely some good things to think about
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:16:20
I actually think this could be a real use case for the blockchain and something we are very much likely to see in our lifetimes. 
Though, this demonstrates the power of the blockchain technology, but Bitcoin the currency is a completely unnecessary piece here. We can still have the benefits of the blockchain for voting whilst using USD in the wider economy. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:55:36
I honestly think if you post a poll in asking how many people in here think Bitcoin is ready for mainstream use, an overwhelming majority will say that is is ready now. You should try. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:06:37
You guys are turning into irrational nutcases, sorry. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:09:41
I think you mean "sneak peek"
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:25:17
I wouldn't worry so much about that. I suspect the market of people who want to buy pizza with bitcoin in your area is close to zero people. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:14:52
I am quite sure that is exactly what many many people on here have said, even if not you personally. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:40:16
People transferring that amount of money around basically don't pay fees. Period. 
I'm a "premier" customer at my own bank (and you don't need a massive net worth to qualify) and all my transfers are free. My transfers internationally within my own accounts are also instant and free. 
The problem is you are poor and offer nothing to the bank, so the only way to profit from you is hit you with big fees. Your problem is thinking big companies are paying 5% on every transfer. They probably pay very close to zero, if not actually zero. 
People keep talking about how Bitcoin is "digital cash" without forgetting that regular currency is also digital cash. The vast majority of it only exists within a machine. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:46:47
That seems very fair, thanks!

Thank You. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:55:45
I'm not looking for strawmen to knock down, I'm just trying to get at least *some handle* on how "Bitcoin becomes a prevailing currency" leads to "A new form of government". 
Infact I'll happily promise to ask no further questions whatsoever, if you prefer, after at least being given an outline on how such a transformation would happen. If I have further questions I can do more reading elsewhere. I wouldn't even know where to start right now because I have no idea whatsoever what the intermediate steps are here. 
Can you please give an idiots guide high level explanation from how (A) leads to (B) in this case?
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:54:24
However, it would appear he was correct:
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:22:48
Yeah but any successful currency system has to be able to work even taking human fallibility into account. Bitcoin does not. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:44:50
So lets say steps 1-3 happen. Everyone embraces crypto, we decide its just a better system than what we were using before so old currencies collapse and we all use Bitcoin instead. Debts are wiped out and we are economically given a "clean start". 
How does (4) follow from this? Why now that our currency is different, is it suddenly so easy to implement a new democratic system? What barrier is being broken by Bitcoin that makes it possible in that system when it isn't possible now?
After (3) I don't see why the world would even need to dramatically change. Systems of government would still exist that just instead use Bitcoin for payments, banks would still exist because they would still be needed for raising money in the capital markets for new businesses, and would still likely look after peoples bank accounts in the same way they do today. 
If I'm paying you in Bitcoin instead of USD ..... why does a new democratic system necessarily follow? I'd really appreciate you taking the time to explain because I'm really trying to understand the logic. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:55:08
Umm ... you do see why your argument is therefore completely stupid?
One Bitcoin &gt; One Dollar is completely irrelevant if you are only giving a tiny fraction of one. 
One GBP &gt; One Dollar, does that mean you'd rather receive 0.00004 GBP than one USD?
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:20:54
Lets keep things short and to the point okay? I'm more than willing to have a conversation to learn more about how this stuff works, but I couldn't make it through that manifesto because it reads like it was written by a crazy person. 
Let me take back then my claim that "it doesn't work". I'm not claiming to be any sort of expert on this or communism, I was giving an opinion based on a high level common-sense level. Maybe you can change my mind. 
But that document is *not* a step by step explanation of how we go from Bitcoin becoming a dominant currency to absolutely everything else changing. Those are the steps I'm trying to understand. If you could please explain in this format that would be great:
1) Bitcoin replaces all other currencies
2) Old fiat debts are paid back in now worthless currency, making our governments effectively debt free and with a clean start
n) New system is considered finalised, people rejoice. 
Its all those middle steps that I can't get my head around, and I'm quite sure that manifesto isn't going to spell it out for me. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:02:00

So 12 it is then. Cheers
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:22:09
I find it strange "usage" graphs mirror the price graphs so much. Why would that be?
If we were talking genuine use, for people buying stuff online etc, I wouldn't expect the usage and price to correlate that closely. 
That said, I suppose that isn't really true since the price graph is logarithmic whereas the usage graph is still linear. Actual usage has only doubled since before the huge bubble in December. Seems to demonstrate that bitcoin was way overpriced then, and it probably still is now. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:37:57
I did try, but I just can't bring myself to read through all that. 
The problem I see with libertarianism is it "doesnt work" in real life the same way communism doesn't work. Although nice in theory and nice to think about, it would lead to a worse standard of living for everyone compared to what we have now. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 08:05:16
No I appreciate what you are saying and I take your points. I did think about this problem when I wrote my reply before, but it is probably a solvable one with or without using the Bitcoin blockchain. I'm sure there are pros and cons of each. 
I do find bitcoin quite fascinating otherwise I wouldn't be here. I do think the blockchain itself has a lot of potential and will find useful applications going forward, and I've no idea what is in store for the bitcoin currency. That's why its interesting to follow!
I don't own bitcoin and I don't plan to buy any now either, but I will be watching on from the sidelines to see where it plays out from here :)
Thanks again for the well thought out responses, it does give some food for thought. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:27:46
Ah, sorry I think I misunderstood your original meaning. When I read "$10m back to your national currency" I was reading that as meaning $10m USD &lt;=&gt; $10m worth of EUR or something. 
Yes Bitcoin exchanges don't have the liquidity so $10m of USD probably would move the price. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 11:35:54
That's some interesting logic. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:56:04
Can someone PLEASE explain to me how we go from:
1) A cryptocurrency gaining in popularity / value
2) No governments, power back to the people, no corruption or power abuse, transparency, traceability, democracy, no banks etc. 
Could someone please explain in plain English how we go from (1) to (2) here? 
Not just rhetoric, but a step by step explanation. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 05:44:27
Why do we assume the choice is only USD or bitcoin?
I don't think the USD is going to crash completely, and if it does there would be more serious economic problems that bitcoin won't be able to help resolve. 
And if the USD was collapsing, why not just buy another currency instead? I'd rather hold all my cash in GBP or EUD than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:41:49
Lets face it mate, you don't have any money anyway. You should embrace inflation since it can also act as a redistribution mechanism, lowering the value of other peoples dollars and lowering the value of your debt to them. 
The fact that its actually a healthy thing for an economy is just an unexpected side bonus!
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:14:03

Err, for one he says Morgan Stanley, not JPM, but two he says a "VP". 
There are thousand of VP's in MS. Actually its the second lowest rank, it goes:
Associate -&gt; VP -&gt; ED (Executive Director) -&gt; MD (Managing Director).
A VP might have a few people report into him/her, but they have no wider say on the direction the firm is taking. If MS was doing something newsworthy, it wouldn't be a VP guiding the project. 
Noone on Wall street (where I work!) give a shit about bitcoin. Sorry.

If you don't mind me asking, what % of your personal networth at this point is held in Bitcoin?
It strikes me you are probably "The strongest hand" out there and will likely never sell .... I'm curious how big your bet is on that. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:04:08
I see. 
I really hope sometime in the future we can chat about this again (perhaps over PM and not in public). 
I only say this because I genuinely believe that Bitcoin will just continue its slide downwards and I don't like to see anyone getting ruined completely over it. 
Good luck with everything.

The "stupidity of groups" is something that is being well proven by this subreddit. This community is definitely providing a lot of evidence that the given hypothesis is true.

@_date: 2015-01-12 14:54:53
It depends what you mean. If someone gave me 100,000 bitcoins tomorrow, I still wouldn't "believe" in it. I'd sell them as quickly as I reasonably could. 
The question sounds like you are offering me a price for me to change my mind on whether I think Bitcoin is otherwise sound. How could merely owning lots of it change anything there?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:50:13

@_date: 2015-01-11 16:26:02
Even *if* that were true, they still wouldn't need to be out cheerleading, getting excited about bitcoin, hiring staff that know about it, running promotions and marketing material etc etc etc
They could just wait for this inevitable time where everyone uses bitcoin. That's enough. 
By the way, if you actually believe those two sentences you wrote you are a total nutcase. I hope you haven't gambled more than can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:14:09

@_date: 2015-01-12 15:32:29
Surely you still can compare though?
I mean, if I'm paying a 1% transaction cost on my USD transfer, what % under market rate are you buying my bitcoins from me for?
If you are paying 95% of the bitcoin rate to buy my bitcoins, isn't that effectively a 5% transaction fee?
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:52:40

@_date: 2015-05-15 00:52:49
The problem you have is that your hatred of government is *so* strong that it forces you down a path where you believe everything it does it wrong / evil. Although government has its problems and makes its own set of mistakes, there are also a ton of good people who are part of it and there is room for doing good also. 
In this case, your hatred of an entity of thousands of people is literally making you make decisions that put other peoples lives at risk. 
That's why I'm saying you need to re-evaluate your "entire outlook on the entire world". Not everything is so black and white where you can decide everything government related is evil and therefore wrong. That mindset is quite literally harmful to both yourself and the people around you. You should be taking some effort to be balanced and rational in your viewpoints. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:13:08

Of course, its just more bullshit Bitcoin = The Internet comparisons. 
Hence the "as far as I can tell". Because its total bullshit based on absolutely nothing. 
The Internet was absolutely designed to scale, and also was designed from day one to be able to route around damage to the network (such as if power was lost to a big region). 
It's almost impossible for Bitcoin to scale to the levels people here hope it will, and just hand waving away "The tech will evolve and solve all the problems" isn't going to help. Some problems around distributed systems simply can't be solved no matter how much we might hope they can be. Have a look at CAP theorem for example. 3 qualities Bitcoin needs and they almost definitely cannot be supported at the same time.

Hahhaha. 
You guys....

Well said mate. Shame this post will go ignored by everyone on this sub.

Not sure why you are taking offense at him there. And what does saving some of your pay check have anything to do with the stock market?
You *should* be saving and ideally investing some part of your pay each month.

It is a very strange excuse, and clearly has nothing at all to do with Alphabet. I'm not sure why they would even claim it was? Just saying YouTube has made changes to its API so it doesn't work would be fine. Why claim it has anything to do with Alphabet? Odd.
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:45:23
Have you replied to the wrong post?

In SV?
Fuck. All.

And the first two are paywalls. 
Nobody likes paywalls. 
And let's face it, if you weren't holding Bitcoin, you wouldn't be pushing for more paywalls either. 
The others are just "more integration", but doesn't change the fact that nobody cares to actually send micropayments around. Two reasons:
1) People don't want to turn all interactions into business interactions. Autistic people might, people who understand how to interact socially do not. 
2) There are only so many decisions a person can even make in a day, nobody wants to put the extra mental energy into deciding whether to send people money or whether a newspaper article is worth a cent to read etc. 
Changetip never went viral either, only within and that's only because they want to see Bitcoin more widely used so their holdings go up. 
Changetip will ultimately die once they burn through their VC funding, there is no workable business model here.

You think all businesses are paying 5% on all bank transfers????
@_date: 2015-04-25 02:05:52
I'm not an anarchist. 
Its inefficient in that it uses as much power that 10% of Ireland uses - to allow 3 transactions a second. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:04:23
Of course he can offer whatever discount he wants. But bitcoin is supposed to be offering him a strategy to save on transaction costs, not just give him another way to pump your funbux. Giving big discounts for paying with bitcoin helps nobody. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:55:49
You people are unbelievable. God knows how you actually survive in the real world. 
Besides, what the fuck do you know about the banking system? Based on what you wrote above, nothing. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:43:22
So you just spent $5000 dollars on something you will never sell and then never see any value for?
Err, nice one mate. 
You utter utter tool. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 09:49:57
Hahahahahaha. 
The paranoia in here is just so awesome. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 10:53:07
The post looks deleted now, but I think he said he literally has never had a single chargeback?
The actual chargeback rate is no doubt far far less than will lead you to believe. 
That and you shouldn't make the assumption that chargebacks are all "bad" and are theft. If I buy a product and somehow they never send it, a chargeback is perfectly reasonable. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:10:26
Based on....?
Fuck all, right?
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:24:32
Hahaha. 
You're a nutcase. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:28:35
You idiots have been saying this for decades. And look, its still going!
I would more than happily bet you $10000 USD right now that fiat currency is the main currency in use for 99%+ of transactions in 2019. If I'm wrong I'll buy you 40 bitcoins (roughly $10k equivalent)
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:39:02
Actually by this point I think they probably are a very significant percentage. Huge amounts get stolen all the time, because the required level of security is not really achievable. Humans are fallible, and any system should still work when that is the case. If it can't, then its useless. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:40:38
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:42:33
And how does that help anyone? Its still effectively a wealth transfer from bitcoiners to thieves. 
If you think the people who stole the coins are going to HODL themselves and not liquidate immediately then you are crazy. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:25:24
I think you made my point for me. Cheers!
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:36:14
If there were ever a need to demonstrate bitcoiners don't understand squat about economics, this thread is a good start. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:28:01
Pretty fitting, doing nothing is what this community does best. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:43:51
You are a ridiculous person.

Has Roger Ver actually done anything at all besides buy/mine tons of Bitcoin when they were super cheap?
Doesn't sound like enough to make him a businessman or an economist. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:51:10
Well they haven't learned so far. And if anything the recent scams have been even more obvious than the ones before. 
The free market here is clearly not working. Its a good lesson for all of us. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:19:45
Hey there big spender
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:49:51
Let me give my reasons. 
The Bitcoin community is absolutely toxic, filled with some of the greediest most deceptive most dishonest people of anywhere. There are scams absolutely everywhere. The Bitcoin community goes so far out of their way to push other people to buy it, not because it solves any real problem, but because they think its a small step to making themselves richer personally. Absolutely everything is done and said out of self interest alone. 
Look at altcoins for example. Theoretically, if Bitcoiners were being completely honest when they talk about why Bitcoin is better than the current banking system, they should support altcoin progress equally as much. After all, the enemy is the current "broken" system right? So as long as it gets replaced by Bitcoin or by a superior altcoin, then all is well right?
Except no, this community *hates* altcoins, because they are a direct threat to Bitcoiners getting rich themselves. Bitcoin isn't about improving the world, its about getting rich for doing nothing. 
The cultish behaviour spamming other subreddits is frustrating, annoying and somewhat embarrassing. The desperation to push Bitcoin to everyone in order to help increase the value of ones own holdings is tiresome. 
The belief that "Buy and do nothing, HODL!" somehow generates wealth or makes the world a better place is also delusional. It makes sense of course when you realise its not about making anything better, its about getting RICH. 
The repetitiveness over stupid things people catch onto here. The idea that Bitcoin and the Internet are even comparable is ridiculous, yet because someone said it once, it gets repeated over and over and over again now. No critical thought happens in this community whatsoever. 
Complete either lack of experience in the real world, or a total misunderstanding of it. People here have no idea how economics work, or why having small controlled inflation is preferable to a deflationary one. Despite the fact that the legitimate Bitcoin economy itself is stagnant, because nobody wants to spend and they only want to hold, proves the deflationary issue perfectly yet its ignored. Because that goes against the goals of getting rich. 
Lets see what else. God like status people for nobodys like Andreas Antonopoulos and all the worship that goes with it. Over somebody who has otherwise achieved basically nothing except for involving himself in more companies that turned out to be scams. 
I've probably had a good enough rant now, I've had a hard day at work (at an investment bank funnily enough) and this is helping. 
Oh yeah the last one, the Bitcoin community is also almost entirely filled with anarchists and libertarians, whose entirely motto can be summed up as "Fuck you, I got mine". I disagree with these people on almost every single view they have, about almost everything. 
So given the backdrop of that kind of community constantly pumping their shitcoin in the hope they can get rich for nothing, the real annoying part is the *smugness* that comes with it. Just look at the top voted reply in this very thread. An extreme amount of smugness and 100% certainty in something that, in 5-10 years time, they will look back on embarrassed thinking "What the fuck was I thinking!". 
So yeah. I don't care about the technology at all, I've nothing against Bitcoin and the blockchain might have applications somewhere, however I get massive schadenfreude as the price goes down and people here lose money. Watching smug cunts on this board lose money is absolutely delicious, because *they absolutely deserve it*
EDIT - Just adding, since I know *someone* will say this. No, I've never bought any Bitcoin and its extremely unlikely I ever will.

@_date: 2015-02-10 12:49:32
Only retards sit crying about inflation. 
Seriously. 
You are not supposed to hold your dollars. This is by design. You are ideally supposed to invest in businesses (directly or indirectly) or in property or other wealth producing assets. And if you were worried about your 2% yearly inflation and you don't want to take any risk whatsoever -- you buy treasury bonds. 
The crying about inflation on this sub is about the stupidest most retarded things you guys write about. Billionaires do not have bank accounts with billions in it. Their wealth are assets which are effectively inflation hedged. 
Sorry, but out of all the stupid things that get written on this subreddit this is the stupidest most annoying of them all. The only people who give a shit about 1-2% inflation are people who don't understand money anyway. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:21:09
It is marvellous. 
It will take more than things like this though for ancaps to realise their dream system just does. not. work.

Google/Facebook etc have their own network effects. They could pull it off if they wanted to.

Coming from a bitcoiner that's quite hilarious. And the best part is you don't know why =D

The funny thing is, if this was implemented with anything other than Bitcoin you would hate the idea.
