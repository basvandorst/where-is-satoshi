Eh, 2-3BTC is my usual coinbase balance, to back my Shift card. But then, this is a relatively small fraction of my total holdings, and the rest is securely stored such that only I can access them. (With a contingency plan in case of hit-by-bus, of course.)

Actually, I think it's &gt;=51% of the bill as a whole that's required to trade in a damaged bill for a fresh one. In any case, these bills are still perfectly valid for their face value of 100 USD, in addition to their new value as bitcoin paper wallets.

There's a pretty significant flaw in reasoning here: The other miners will be busy mining away on blocks that don't contain this hypothetical 11-minute transaction, so they'll likely surpass the chain that has it in the time it takes to verify it and build another on top... It is far more likely that the monster block would just get orphaned if it took that long to verify.

Larger blocks are more likely to be orphaned. Miners can balance this with the fees they're taking in, and stop adding more to their block when the added fees are no longer worth the added orphan risk.

That is entirely likely, but *not* setting it as an official limit now turns it into a potential unplanned fork, as the miners vote for &gt;32 and the code simply can't handle it. Setting it makes it clear to everyone that that's the next time we'll have to deal with this shit. Fixing it now would require much larger changes, which will be much harder to push through now.

The soft limit should be set randomly by default. This will encourage miners to actually take an interest in configuring their mining policies, removing the centralized decision from the core devs.

But only those participating/aware of the DIP system will follow the rules not to relay/mine them. Unaware nodes may happily relay/mine them, and be duped into declaring support.
I'm not sure how much space is currently left for claiming in the coinbase tx, but it has historically been the place for miners to declare opinions, specifically because it is required to come from the actual miner.
I'll admit though that I did not give this as thorough a reading as it probably deserves...

The 32MB limit *is* part of the protocol - the P2P messages for transmitting blocks simply can't handle blocks larger than that currently. It requires a network wide upgrade to go further. Doing that upgrade now is probably wrong, since we don't know if we need that capacity yet. Doing the proposed for now lets us more accurately gauge the need for that space, and we can plan a protocol upgrade as it gets closer (That conversation should probably start somewhere around 16MB, based on how long this one has dragged out...).

So you are connecting out to a VPN server somewhere, not tryign to have a VPN from one of your devices to get back in to your network while out? If so, that should jsut work, regardless of router configuration, that's a bit odd...
You network layout sounds a bit strange to me. Whenever I set something up, I always put the ISP's modem in bridged mode if possible, or configure it so that it has a DMZ entry for the "real" router, then connect everything to that and forward things as normal there. This gives your "real" router a public IP, and proper control of the routing/firewall, which usually makes everything work properly.

The 32MB limit is a technical one, not a political one - the protocol needs to be updated to go past that, which is the same challenge as a hard fork. This limit would be there whether the BIP stated it or not, this just makes it clear that they've thought through "okay, so when are we going to have to do this again?"

I can't speak for Plutus, as there aren't enough NFC payment terminals in my life for it to be worth using, but with Shift, I keep a couple BTC in my Coinbase account as "spending money" and the rest are safely locked away in my own personal storage.

"doesn't buy me anything" is an expression which refers to the benefits you get from something.

You mention that a VPN fails - is this an inbound or outbound VPN?
You also mentioned a new modem and also a netgear router - Do you have your own router in addition to the ISP provided modem/router? If so, you may need to forward ports twice, once on each device. (Or, ideally, get the modem switched to "bridged mode"!)

As but a simple non-mining fullnode, I don't personally have much power, but I'm on the XT train as of a few days ago! I still think mining policies (block size (soft), minimum fee/kb, non-forking script type filters, luke's various "anti-spam" measures) should have nonsensical/random defaults though, or better no defaults at all, to force miners to actually decide for themselves what they will/won't mine.

@_date: 2015-06-11 18:40:47
Not zero, but a level that is just-barely functional. Randomize on startup between this minimum and whatever the current hard limit is, unless the miner specifically configures it. Miners will want to increase it to collect additional fees (from additional transactions), so they'll actually configure their nodes (as BTC China and AntPool just did). Now block size will actually be determined by the miner's tolerance for orphan-risk balanced with their desire for fees. *This* is how the fee market happens, not by an artificial constraint on block size.

Not getting that transaction's fee *is* the punishment. If that's not enough, you aren't paying enough fees. (Though, this won't really work well until the new-coin-issuing part of the block reward drops a bit further.)
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:43:10


If they choose to leave out a transcation, they are choosing to pass up the fee attached to that transaction also. That's what it's there for!
@_date: 2015-12-31 06:28:17


So, anyone can make a tx with the DIP flag in it, and any miner who mines this without understanding it would effectively declare support for a proposal they don't know about. It's probably better to require this to be in some data that the miner themself must create - it's annoying to overload the coinbase tx, but if you put it in there it's at least authenticated as being originally from the miner.
@_date: 2015-12-31 06:57:18
Aha, soak moon tits.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:30:08
Leaving the block size at 1MB is not 'free market' - it's regulated supply. If you truly want a free market for fees, remove the cap entirely, allowing miners to decide how much block space they are willing to produce for a given fee amount.

I think the core problem with the term (and most of your alternatives) is that "trust" is generally seen as a good thing by everyone but cryptographers, to whom it is the most horrible of crimes to "trust" anything or anyone! 
Cryptographers: "I want a system I don't have to trust!"  
Everyone else: "I want a system I *can* trust!"
The two are not mutually exclusive, of course, but they're very different perspectives! I think "Provable" or "Decentralized Trust" would probably satisfy both audiences. Or perhaps "Provable Trust", which crypotgraphers will cringe at a little bit, but grudgingly accept as a marketing-ism, and everyone else will read as a *better* kind of trust!

The statement that 0-conf is okay has some extra conditions attached to it (or should, at least): 
 * For small amounts
 * After seeing the tx broadcast back from many widely-separated nodes
Small amounts means the risk if it fails is small (adjust the threshold to taste), and seeing it broadcast back from many nodes means that it has propagated through the network and eventually *somebody* will put it in a block. 
Edit: Oh, and you can't use txid until it's confirmed, until malleability gets a permanent fix.

This makes me think it's possibly a watching-only address added to your wallet somehow (I don't use the blockchain wallet, but I assume it has this feature). Based on the amount, I'd guess it's possibly the address from the break-my-brainwallet thread earlier. In any case, you should probably move all of your btc over to a newly generated wallet just to be sure. And if you're using a brainwallet, pick a better password this time.

Still applies, but the vulnerability that this protects you from is not *currently* relevant (unless you're using bad RNG), it's primarily a preemptive protection against a future break of ECDSA.
That said, you could perhaps make this more secure by putting the roots of an HD wallet in there.

Use any available means (exploits and/or user error) to execute remote code on the android device. In the code that you remotely execute, use any available means to gain root and/or accessibility-service access. Monitor device interaction until the user spends bitcoin on something, but modify the submit form's contents to send the coins to yourself, or to send some/all of the rest of the user's coins to yourself, leaving the original intended spend as-is, so that the user's transaction doesn't fail, and they won't notice right away.
Bitcoin itself is pretty solid, but the machines and humans that surround it are somewhat easier to trick into doing things they shouldn't, so all you have to do to steal bitcoins is stop trying to steal them from Bitcoin, steal them from the device/user.

Or, for your specific example, you want Alice and 1-of-4 of Bob, Joe, Shawn, and Adam. This is actually simpler than a weigthed multisig, as it's simply a logical anding of a single key and a 1-of-4, which can simply be back to back.
This should do it:
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;alicepubkeyhash&gt; 
    OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 
    1 &lt;bobpubkey&gt; &lt;joepubkey&gt; &lt;shawnpubkey&gt; &lt;adampubkey&gt; 4
    OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY
You'll still need to do some work to sign it though. Alice's signature should be on top of the stack, which one of the other four's signature below it, and a junk item for CHECKMULTISIG below that.
Alternately, You can give Alice a 4-weight key, and everyone else (plus one backup) a 1-weight, and if something happens to Alice (or her key), then all four of the others (plus the backup key) could still spend funds if they agree on it. Like so:
    0 OP_TOALTSTACK
    OP_IFDUP OP_IF 
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;alicepubkeyhash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 
    OP_FROMALTSTACK 4 OP_ADD OP_TOALTSTACK 
    OP_ENDIF
    OP_IFDUP OP_IF 
    OP_DUP OP_TOALTSTACK
    &lt;bobpubkey&gt; &lt;joepubkey&gt; &lt;shawnpubkey&gt; &lt;adampubkey&gt; &lt;backuppubkey&gt; 5
    OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY
    OP_FROMALTSTACK 
    OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_ADD OP_TOALTSTACK
    OP_ENDIF
    OP_FROMALTSTACK 5 OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL OP_VERIFY
The stack for this one would be one of the following:
    X &lt;sig&gt; 1 &lt;alicesig&gt; &lt;alicepubkey&gt;  // Alice and one other
    X &lt;sig&gt; &lt;sig&gt; &lt;sig&gt; &lt;sig&gt; &lt;sig&gt; 5 0 // all five others, without Alice

It will indeed be a pretty shitty day. However, reused addresses will be in for slightly more hurt than single-use addresses, since there would need to also be a break in RIPEMD160 and SHA256 to affect them. Realistically a very slight difference, but it is there.
And on that note, I am personally of the opinion that we should be looking at adding other kinds of pub/priv key opcodes to script so that people have options for using other crypto, or doing 2-of-2 multisig with different algos if they are concerned about such things. (Even if it's not a default/isStandard, it could still be used in P2SH transactions for those determined to do it.)
EDIT: It's also likely that an ECDSA break would not happen all at once, so we'd have some warning and single-use keys would be "safe enough" to last through a transition to another algo.

Except for blocks that cover timespans during which more coins were lost/destroyed than were issued in the coinbase for that block!
Edit: or rather, the block immediately after - The block right after a coin-destruction event will see the total number of coins *decrease*, so the rate of inflation drops negative, followed by a block where new coins are issued without an associated destruction, causing a net increase again, so the inflation rate spikes back up to close to slightly above where it used to be (since the total number of coins in circulation is now lower).

Because we (I was part of that 96%) only got to put our vote on one option, and it is clearly the *most* desirable option, because if we just switch to another pool, we'll just have to move again when that pool expands. I strongly suspect that if the poll had been an alternative-vote poll, the result would have been p2pool as first choice, not-ghash as second, and ghash as third place. I also suspect that if they ran a poll for "we're having trouble with the p2pool migration, should we switch to not-ghash in the mean time?" that the answer would be strongly in favor of doing so.

BitPay and Coinbase are transition mechanisms.

Wallet patches is what will actually make this simple enough to start getting people on board in meaningful numbers, and it's the thing most people making alias services miss. If you did submit patches and get them accepted, you'd have a pretty huge advantage over basically everyone else who's tried this before. It would also serve as the wallet maintainer vouching for you/your project, so it would help build some trust.
And while that little snipit is all you'd need on your side, the part that would really make this an attractive service is a patch that recognizes aliases in the "Send Bitcoin" form's destination field, and maps it out to an address directly.

I'm going to assume this example was amount you would be comfortable being handed in cash, in which case I actually *would* have used a phone-wallet, or my reddit tip wallet (since this was already in the context of reddit, and thus already tied to my username) for that example, and then moved the coins to another wallet as appropriate afterwards. I'm probably just not your target audience though, because I also wouldn't want to log into your service (or pretty much any bitcoin-related service) from a device I didn't own (like a company's computer) either!

That was my theory too, and it does make sense, I was just slightly surprised how clearly visible it was in that particular period.


Like those couple of blocks with &gt;200BTC fees? (Damn I wish I could have mined one of those...)
Also, related to fees, I'd be curious to see a chart that shows the relation of block-size to average-fee-per-(k)B in that block, over time, though I have no idea how that could be nicely displayed...

IIRC, you only need the public half of HD wallets to generate the chain of pubkeys, so no need to unlock the privkey, but you do still need to trust the device that is paying you + incrementing the key.

Every block would be too fast, since there is a significant random component to the time between blocks. The 2016-block interval is intended to smooth out that randomness to make difficulty actually reflect the network-wide hashing power, rather than the 'luck' component of the last few blocks.

There's some potential for de-anonymization by studying the blockchain, but beyond that nothing really notable. If you also re-use the address, then it's a pretty sure thing that you're de-anonymized by it.


I would trust an address on an non-user-editable section of a Wikipedia page, because it would be signed by their SSL cert when viewing the HTTPS version of the site. Their DNS zone isn't *as* good verification, but at least it's something.

In any case, that entire comment is an ad hominem against people not present in this thread. How about a real point so I have something of substance to continue discussion from?
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:20:13
Which wallet you use is mostly up to your preference, and depends on a lot of things (features, where you want/need to access it from, among other things). I can't really say what *you* should do, since I'm not you, but I'll tell you what *I* do.
I personally have the following set of wallets:
* Reddit tip wallet (blockchain.info web-wallet with only one key), usually ~0.1BTC, depending on how generously I've tipped recently.
* Both schildbach's wallet and mycellium on my phone, total ~1BTC
* Armory hot wallet, ~2BTC
* Armory 'warm' wallet (with a much longer password), the rest.
Once I convince myself I have a disaster-proof offline key storage system, I'm gong to split the 'warm' wallet, leaving only ~10BTC in it, and moving the rest offline.
I chose Armory for my 'primary' wallet app based on the following:
* It's a deterministic wallet, so I only have to back it up once. I have this backup in multiple places, including one off-site, so I'm not losing any coins to failed hardware.
* It's a local wallet. I take my PC security very seriously (it's basically my job), so I trust it more than pretty much any web service I interact with.
* It's a full-node wallet. I was already running a full node, and have the resources to continue doing so, so I do because it's good for the network. If you don't want a full node (and the relatively large resource requirements that go with that), Electrum might be good to look at as an alternative, it relies on third-party servers to do blockchain verification.
* It makes it easy to only use each address twice (once to receive, once to send).
I haven't used the phone wallets much, so I'm not sure which I like better yet, but when I do decide, I'll get rid of the other one. They both have the disavantage of re-using the same address forever, but that can be dealt with by simply re-keying them occasionally. The reddit wallet has this issue also, but it's tied to my username anyway, so that doesn't really matter. All three of these wallets I keep to small amounts (actual amount varies with exchange rate, but very slowly) that would be merely inconvenient if I did lose them, but I still have backups of all the relevant keys.

If you're careful about it, they probably won't. But if you put "bitcoin" in the transaction memo, for example, they'll kill your account, even if it was just a joke.

Err, just running a full node isn't actually that taxing, if you're not mining. My PC is running both bitcoin and litecoin fullnodes, the two together using ~800MB of RAM (500 for bitcoin, 300 for litecoin), little to no passive disk activity (a small burst when new blocks come in), only short bursts of about 100KB/s total network usage (normally more like 10KB/s), and average cpu usage so close to 0 that I can't give an accurate estimate of how much of a single core it's using. The only thing that's at all resource heavy is storing the blockchains, and storage is *cheap*!
It certainly costs *way* less than $20/month to run.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:19:38

A lot of people seem to miss that the gox TM problem involves at least *three* txs, only two of which make it to the chain.
* You withdraw 1BTC from gox. This generates tx A.
* You modify tx A to create tx B and broadcast it. This one is a double-spend of tx A, so only one of (A|B) can get on the chain.
* If tx B goes on the chain, gox doesn't see it, sees that tx A never went through, and resends your payment as tx C. Tx C now goes on the chain also, because gox didn't properly double-spend inputs from tx A when they generated C to replace it.
The chain now has tx B and tx C on it. This will be recognizable as two txs back to back to the same destination, where the first one has an 'unusual' ScriptSig.
In theory you could TM tx C to make a tx D and continue this, leaving a series of tampered-with txs followed by one 'normal' one eventually.

There are only two things preventing my proposal (which draws heavily from prior discussion on the subject) for flipping the chain from being done *right now*. 1) I don't have time to implement it 2) There are no UTXO hashes in the chain for quick-syncing. (Which I proposed a partial solution for, but haven't had a chance to work through the details. Some others in that thread were in fact helping with exactly that!)

As soon as you spend from that address, you should re-key. Receiving with it multiple times is fine, but once you've spent from it once, the public key and one signature are now included in the blockchain, and could theoretically be used to reveal the private key, either through bad RNG (the old android wallet bug), or through some unknown ECDSA vulnerability.

(And this is the specific vector I was thinking of when mentioning the KT hack, not specifically compiler/toolchain, but bootloader.)
(Just to be clear, I actually *do* trust Trezor, and will likely buy one (maybe two?) soon if I don't get one for Christmas, I'm just following the chain of "It's open source, so we can check!"/"Well...." to the absurd, because that's how these things are done.)

ECDSA won't break overnight, there will be warning, in the form of minor weakenings that only work under specific conditions. Bitcoin will probably drop a few percent when a minor weakening is announced, wallets will be tweaked to avoid those conditions if possible, and suddenly everyone will be working on adding diverse signature algorithms (which really ought to be happening now imho). Coins will move to different algorithms as they're introduced, and if this happened fast enough, the price will recover.
Also, crypto issues aren't the only thing single-use keys protect you from - they make it somewhat harder to put a name to the coins, if you care about that.

And it's a value that everyone likely to be involved in the process will have on hand, or can at least get close to.

Annoyance at best? So I go get any list of email addresses I can find, and pre-register all of them. Now hundreds (thousands?) of people who use their normal (correct!) email address for this system are actually paying me, because they didn't even realize that could be a problem. Sounds like a pretty significant DOS to me.
edit: the root of the problem here is that you have the wrong side of the link protected by the blockchain. You have an address stating "I am &lt;email&gt;", but nothing from the email verifying that this is in fact true. Anyone can say "I am satoshi and sign it with an arbitrary bitcoin address. All that proves is that address has claimed it, it does *not* verify that claim. You need something that proves ownership of the email address, and that's much harder to prove in a small blob of data on the blockchain (unless you add a trusted third party, but that kinda defeats the purpose).

Banks have money. You can get a lot of things with money, including chips, chip fabs, and chip designers. Or maybe it's not banks, maybe it's Visa, or Paypal, or both. They have money and technology! They all also have some amount of motive to either drive people away from bitcoin or control it, since it threatens their niche. But it doesn't really matter who it is, it's still an important question: If there were a serious attempt to gain 51% control and then use that to force 100% and/or actually block transactions, how do we defend against them? The only immediate action I can see (please, point out more!) is to bring any idle mining power online to try to delay them. So, how much mining power could be fired up on short notice to delay an attack? Hopefully it's enough to figure out a more permanent solution...

You still have the problem of the syntax being identical to email addresses, so a user has no idea if that's an email or bitcoin address, or both. And what you described isn't exactly what I intended, but I actually like it better. It still has the problem of being a fixed address though (perhaps some tie-in with BIP70 can help that?).
Also, if the intent is to match the format of email addresses so that you can tie a bitcoin address to an email address, how do users of email hosting services like gmail get their bitcoin addresses into the right place? Do we have to convince google to support this?

A 51% attack is 100% effective against all nodes, regardless of when they joined. The fork that the "evil" 51% mines is just as valid as any other fork, and once it is longer, all nodes will switch to it, regardless of how much it rewrites (assuming it starts after the most recent checkpoint). The only difference between a node joining mid-attack vs a node that was already present is that the existing node will have the "honest"/old fork pre-validated, while the new node will validate both forks from scratch, before picking the longest one.

How is this better than using a new address every time you receive payment? 
Use a deterministic wallet that can create public-only versions, and preferably can branch. Use multiple wallet roots if branching isn't supported. Use a new branch any time you have a recurring payment. Use a separate branch for change. Optionally tumble coins from recurring payment streams into general addresses before you spend them.
What problem does this fancy indexed-access deterministic wallet solve better, in exchange for blockchain space and added transaction validation complexity?

To prompt users to come log in with a compromised version of the software, of course. If I were to hack such a service, that's what I'd do! Inject a little extra code that grabs private keys after the user logs in and phones home with them, then send out panic-inducing notifications to get a lot of users to log in at once, before the hack is discovered!

That's why you give anyone who is sending you a recurring payment the public half of a wallet branch just for them, at the time you set up the recurring payment relationship. They can calculate the next address each time they want to pay you. As long as they don't share the branch-seed for that chain, nobody but you and them knows those addresses belong to you, and they're going to know anyway, since they're paying you regularly.

I didn't say you couldn't, merely that unless the user does they can't be 100% sure! :) 
I meant no offense, I just felt the need to make sure people are aware of that. A lot of people like to assume that pre-built bundles of open source software will always match the published source, which isn't always a valid assumption!


Being redundant is exactly what makes it valuable, and what I was saying I love about it. It's a very clever, yet simple, 'hack' to identify and avoid things that may or may not go wrong in the future! I think it actually solves more than you realize though, because in the case of a fork like the one that BIP I linked described, you might become aware of it faster due to having multiple perspectives to the state of the network. These extra perspectives could potentially also help you avoid other kinds of attacks too, but that one seems the most obvious. Sorry if my praise of this awesome hack was unclear!

There is actually no such guarantee. It's fairly *likely* that this will be true, but there's also a small chance that even with constantly increasing hash power there could be one random 16-day round. Or, with an even smaller chance, a 20-day or 30-day round.

Exchanges are in the second camp by necessity. They deal with the fiat system too, and have to play by those rules too, which means at least a little centralization. Also, they deal with time scales much shorter than single blocks, so it's useful (but not strictly required) for them to be off-chain.
I don't like it either, but then again, I just stay off the exchanges. (If I want to swap BTC/USD, they'll pass briefly through CoinBase before moving off to a wallet I control.)

Clients don't control a fork, miners do. If it's done with a transition similar to the BIP16 change for P2SH (miners put a flag in coinbase, and when enough agree change behavior, the only reasonable way to make any change to Script), then it should be fork-free, though you're right that the clients would need to update in order to actually *use* the new opcode.

It feels so weird to say this, but I've seen more posts/comments from you that I'd consider trolling in the last couple days than I have from who is usually my yardstick for measuring the level of trolling in a thread against (or at least, used to be...)! Particularly in your recent thread bashing the moderators for not doing enough, in which your arguments against those you were calling trolls were frequently of the form "You're (a known troll|getting paid for this)", or other ad hominems.
Just because you don't like what someone is saying doesn't make them a troll, it just makes it harder to listen to them. Many people are saying things that very-positive bitcoiners don't want to hear, but much of it is the equal-but-opposite distortion to counter the positive stuff around here and keep some realism. Bitcoin is great, but it's not perfect - There are a lot of areas that need work. Pointing them out isn't (inherently) trolling, trolling is stuff that actively disrupts useful discussion, like bashing the mods.

Ah, yes, I always forget that layer, because it's so transparent to everything I do! That does seem like a much more reasonable way to count though. I'm not sure exactly how to count how many AS hops it is, so I'll just assume it's &gt;=2 and &lt;= IP-hops, and not worry about the exact number!

It sounds like you're doing it mostly-right. If you have a watch-only wallet that goes with your cold storage, you can build an unsigned transaction there, take it to your offline system with your cold storage key(s) and sign it there, then bring it back to your online system to broadcast. Armory has a fairly straight-forward interface for doing this, but it's also possibly with other wallets.
If you do chose to trust third parties, I would suggest you spread your risk by splitting your coins among multiple different reputable third parties though, at least that way you can't lose *everything* to one third party going to the dark side.

After about 2hours of grinding away on CPU to compress it, it only squeezed about 8GB of "fluff" out of the raw 20GB, and that's with it in pretty large chunks, which makes it impractical to decompress on the fly for use. Based on this, I'd say that compression is not really a viable strategy for improving storage requirements.

I've yet to see anyone actually explain how "send a coin to non-empty address and watch them spend it" is any better than "pick any non-empty address from UTXO and watch them spend it", assuming you always move all the coins from an address when you use it, which you should be doing anyway as part of avoiding address re-use. The only difference I see is that there's a slightly larger change coin at the end.

Ballpark estimate:
* I have 70 peers.
* There is a block to relay every 10 minutes, to make math easier let's assume max-size 1MB blocks.
* It looks like we're at ~60k tx/day, with a high estimate of average size at 500B.
* Assume that each transaction and/or block received needs to be relayed to half of current peers (sometimes you'll be the first, sometimes the last, it'll work out to half or close to it in the long run)
This means your tx relay bandwidth is 60k tx/day * 500B/tx * 70 * 1/2 = 98kbps.
Block relaying bandwidth 1 block/10 min * 1MB/block * 70 * 1/2 = 466kbps.
So, to just barely keep up, you'll need on the order of 0.5mbps, almost all of which will be upload. However, the bitcoin network will benefit much more from nodes with enough bandwidth to do large bursts than it will from nodes that just barely keep up (especially when distributing new blocks), so ideally you'd want to be a couple orders larger than that. I'd say 2-5mbps of upload is probably the point at which it starts making sense to be a full node, based on this very approximate calculation.
Also, if you're on the low end of that range, you can still contribute without dragging your network down by configuring QoS on your router to treat bitcoin as 'bulk', so that it only uses your connection if there's nothing else that needs it first. This makes very little difference to how much you're helping the network, while having much less impact on your own connection from the regular large bursts of uploading.

But since we're talking about a post-checkpoint attack (which would still let you erase all the way back to April right now...), there's no significant difference between a new-joiner vs a pre-existing node, yet you seem to continue to say there is. I'm just trying to understand what this claimed difference is...


But that knowledge is no longer relevant once a longer/greater-POW branch appears. You switch to it anyway, because *that's what the consensus algorithm does*. The fact that the old branch won in the past has no bearing on if it can be replaced now or not when a new greater-POW branch appears. Similarly, you can't assume that "everyone else accepted it an hour ago" means "everyone one else accepts it now". They'll switch when they get the longer chain too!


I'm pretty sure we've said a couple times here that we're talking about an attack who's fork-point is after the most recent checkpoint...

Never said it was perfect, but it's certainly a start. Obviously, if you really were doing this, you'd do something more complex than just emptying the now-public address into a new single address. Maybe you just move it in small slightly randomized reasonable-purchase size chunks to many new addresses, and simply declare that you spent it all. Optionally combine with passing it through mixing services and/or coinjoin, as you see fit. Or put it all in an exchange, buy an altcoin, take it to one or more other exchanges and cash out back to bitcoin.

It's a privacy thing - by having *all* the addresses, and a username/email, you've built up a substantial amount of information about who your users are. But mostly, I don't see the point - My cold wallet doesn't change that often, I *know* how much is in it. If it's changing, I'm at home moving coins. If I'm not at home, the only wallet I care about is the pocket-change wallet on my phone. Also, a merchant won't even get teh public address of my cold storage - they'll get one out of one of my pocket-change wallets that I actually spend from. Cold would only ever be used to refill those, never to pay directly.
Basically, the value your service provides doesn't justify the potential privacy leakage of it, at least to me. I'm sure others disagree, but there are many of us who value the privacy more than the convenience.

Yeah, they sorta steady, unless something new happens to spawn really close (which happens a lot at first, since the UI buttons start near center).


Yeah, I like the stick-in-place, but suspect it might be what's blocking click-for-functionality.


If the whole thing was full-window, the buttons would fit nicely in a row down above the donation address. But the UI-buttons are a fundamentally different class of thing from the address/transaction graph nodes, and shouldn't be mixed in, plus they get hard to find after a while if you just let them float.


Yeah, I've had some fun variations show up while watching it for a few minutes. While typing this reply I got a *massive* one that did the [bitcoin-off-the-corner]( bug again, after which it keeps playing sounds, but the nodes never move.

There are no unused bits in the *binary* form of the address. We're not talking about the binary form though, we're talking about the base58 form. 25 bytes comes out to 34.14 characters in base58, so are some extra "bits" in the last character, which are probably treated as 0s when encoding, and ignored when decoding, which would show up as ignoring that you incremented the last character, until you reach a certain amount of change where you're actually changing the part of that character that *was* in use.

And because I feel the need to bring this full circle here, this could affect bitcoin as follows: 
If you:
1. Used an affected Bitcoin Core/Bitcoin-QT version
1. Used a Payment Protocol link that connects via SSL (Is that required for PP? I haven't studied PP very much yet, since it's not in Armory yet afaik)
1. Through that PP request, connected to a malicious server
Then you could potentially have sent a chunk of your RAM's contents to that server, which could potentially contain bitcoin private keys. It's a fairly narrow attack, but it *is* possible, so people should consider if it is appropriate for them to rekey, which it probably is if they used PP on an affected version.

@_date: 2014-03-11 00:31:59




My basic thinking on this though, is that if it was actually a big enough problem to be worth doing, we'd have FirstBits support in most major wallets a long time ago. The fact that we don't means nobody could be bothered to write what is a fairly straight forward feature for full-node clients. SPV wallets would require someone else to help them out, since they don't have a full chain to calculate from, but they already need that for certain kinds of verification anyway.
In any case, any kind of alias that doesn't also submit the associated patches to wallets is basically doomed anyway, since nobody will use it if they can't count on everyone else (or at least most of everyone else) being able to use it easily. Even P2SH/multisig addresses have this problem still somewhat, I was playing with one yesterday and found that Armory still won't accept them as valid destinations, I had to use the wallet on my phone instead.






I'd love to see how you do this, especially the Armory flavor, but it would probably still be a tough sell to get me to use it. (Most of the same security concerns apply still, and without wallet integration it's still not offering much to compensate.)

Because the thing being hashed isn't actually the whole block, it's the [block header]( This header contains hashes of the rest of the content in the block, but it also contains a 'nonce', which is incremented each time to produce a different hash value. Miner keep incrementing this and re-hashing until they get a hash that's below the current target, then they publish their newly found block, and it becomes part of the chain.

You comment isn't clear if you're day-trading or buy-and-holding. If the former, then coins on an exchange is a necessary evil, and there's not really a way around that. If the latter, you should buy your coins and transfer them to a wallet you fully control.

My point is that you seem to be saying when a node receives a new header that passes checksums, that header is automatically the 'winner' of the race for the next block. The problem is, it can't be the 'winner' until miners can mine on it, and that doesn't happen until they have the transactions too. Are they supposed to just stop and wait when they get a new winning header, or do they keep mining on top of whatever the longest complete chain they have is, even if it doesn't include the new winning header?
I guess the thing I don't get is what the point of propagating headers faster is, when it doesn't actually help any process that needs to be streamlined.

Get an address from your local wallet (how/where depends on the wallet, but it's usually one of the most prominently displayed things), then use Coinbase's Send Money button, and paste the local wallet address in the "To:" field. 
Later, if you want to send some back in order to sell them, you can go to [Account Settings -&gt; Bitcoin Addresses]( and send coins back to any of the addresses it shows you (or hit the "New Address" button and send to the new one, if you prefer). Alternately, you can use the "Request Money" button and either email it to yourself, or leave the email address blank to get a QR code/address.

I mentioned two kinds of problems here, and I'm not sure which you're asking about:
1. The bad RNG problem I mentioned is specifically a bug that was encountered [last year]( with some android wallets where due to poor RNG the signatures from those wallets were leaking enough information to obtain private keys, and many people had funds stolen before the bugs were fixed.
2. An unknown future ECDSA vulnerability that allows recovery of private keys from public key+signature. Obviously there is no good write up of this, because it either hasn't been discovered, or is being kept secret! :)
In either case, the simplest step to mitigate the attack is to spend *all* funds from a given address at once (sending any change to a new, previously-unused change address), and then never use that address again.
Also, the reason spending from an address is the trigger for this is because before that, the address only appears on the chain as RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)), so even the key itself is not known at that point. Once you spend it though, the transaction you create contains the pubkey itself (to prove it's the key that matches that hash), and a signature from that key (to prove that the owner of that key approves of the transaction), which means you've lost your protection from any ECDSA flaws (known or unknown) that keeping your keys hidden provided.
Direct multisig transactions do not get this protection, as all the pubkeys are there in full, but P2SH scripts *do*, since the entire redeem script is reduced to a hash until you spend from it (at which point you should re-key that too, but nobody really pushes for that currently).

Ah, so you're plugging your own site. That makes a little more sense.
Still seems silly though for the rest of us, when we can do the exact same thing on our own with armory or electrum, and not have to trust you to keep the list of keys for a given username/email private (and not have to trust you to protect it adequately from server compromise by malware/hackers/governments).

I was simplifying, because that wasn't really relevant to my point: the operation miners are good at (partial preimage of sha256) is still only part of the set needed for getting someone's keys (full preimage of ripemd160, full preimage of sha256, reverse key derivation of ECDSA)

You also have to never use the payment protocol to be unaffected.

You'd also be able to spot the non-standard representation of the signature in tx (2), or whatever else was mutated to make it not match tx (1). Basically you're looking for a mutated tx followed by a delayed "normal" tx to the same destination in the same amount.

It actually wouldn't be that bad for most of it - for transaction related things, all that would be needed is to add new Script opcodes for whatever new hashes are desired, and people can start using them. This is also part of the reason why an address is RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)), if only one of the hashes is broken, it's still protected by the other one, giving some time to make the needed changes.
Switching the mining algo is somewhat harder, since it pretty much necessarily means starting from scratch in building the mining network, since all the ASICs would be obsolete, but there should be plenty of time to figure out how to deal with that, since a partial weakening of SHA256 would appear (for the purposes of mining) to simply be a faster hashing engine!

I first got in by mining [the block at height 108031]( This was just after we first hit $1 parity, by a couple days. I kept mining for some time after that, and got a few more solo blocks before switching to pool mining. There wasn't a good way for me at the time to actually exchange between USD and BTC, but I did buy a few things using some of my coins from some early shops, most of which no longer exist. I'm still holding most of my coins until I have more local places to spend them though, spending off my fiat in the mean time.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:40:37
As a hold-your-own-coins person myself, I do understand *some* of the reasons people do this:
Those who are actually doing day-trading pretty much have to. Exchanges are the interface to the existing fiat infrastructure, so they have to play by the fiat rules too, in addition to the bitcoin rules. Also, they (mostly) deal with time scales much shorter than a single-block-time, so it's useful (but not strictly required for functionality) for them to manage transactions off-chain between on-chain deposits/withdraws. It's not ideal, but for an interface between such widely different systems, it's surprisingly good.
*Storing* coins in exchanges on the other hand is just plain silly, and people need to stop that.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:50:41
Yes, but if *the rest of the miners* can't actually mine until they receive the whole block (which they can't), but they wait for it because it's per-determined to be the winner, then I can stop *everyone else* from mining with very few PoW cycles, and then while they figure it out I can fork the chain and mine all on my own for a while! Plus, even if I gain nothing from it, I've brought the entire validation network down until somebody fixes it.

This is not true - a 51% can rewrite any and all blocks back to the most recent "checkpoint" block in bitcoin-core (becuase a large enough portion of the network is made up of '-core that anything that fails it's checkpoint test won't be accepted by the network as a whole). It [looks like]( the most recent checkpoint was [Block  so anything after that is fair game to be rewritten, with enough hashpower.
However, the further back you want to rewrite, the longer it'll take you to overtake the "honest" hashing power on the other side of the fork, so if you want to do that much, you'd probably better plan on more like a 70%-80% attack to catch up faster.

I worded that poorly then, but this is a separate issue - when you're arguing a point, you argue the point, not the person opposing you.

We are not the moderators though, so all *we* can do is continue making arguments against the point in question. 
The core difference seems to be that we disagree on what constitutes "actively disrupting useful discussion".

The claim is usually made because they use scrypt which is (currently) harder to attack with dedicated hardware. This argument completely ignores the vast difference in the *size* of the relevant mining networks, and the fact that scrypt ASICs are on the way, and AMD is currently optimizing their next round of cards for scrypt mining, making the point essentially moot. Nothing is immune to custom-hardware forever.

(And by dumb luck, this happens to be a particularly good example for this discussion!)
Which input pays which output? The inputs are all destroyed, and new outputs are created, but there's really nothing that says "this input became that output". The closest there is is the order they appear in the transaction, but that may very well be random, it depends on whoever authored the transaction!
Edit: Also, "is this coin traceable?" is an entirely separate question from "is an old coin more secure than a newly-minted coin?". The answer to the first is "Maybe", the answer to the second is basically "No". (Assuming it's already passed the newly-mined-coin maturation time of 100 blocks.)

Yep, it's pretty clear that the stamp itself is a tx hash in the email header. The tx itself on teh chain would have a hash of the message content and recipient address (and possibly other metadata), to prevent reusing stamps.


Yeah, the most interesting way I came up with for distributing server public keys for a stamp-pays-receiving-server scheme was a DNS TXT record with the key. 


So now the receiving server has to accept and store messages with insufficient postage, and actively work to collect postage on them? That seems backwards. The recipient server's responsibility should be to check if postage is sufficient, and if not reject the message (possibly with an appropriate bounce message, depending on how bad the back-scatter is).


This is a problem that will eventually solve itself as the demand for to to be solve increases.


I agree that the *most* important thing in such a scheme is that sending a message has a cost. However, I think it is only slightly less important who receives that value. Given that we seem to have already agreed that destroying is not great, it makes far more sense to pay the recipient's mail server, who then has to process and store the message (which is a task with some cost), than to pay miners who have nearly nothing to do with the task at hand (and are already payed by the bitcoin tx fee). I also think such a system would be far more likely to get adopted (but still not very likely, based on the history of attempts at making e-stamps) if the recipient server, or even end-user keeps the stamps instead of destroying them or sending them to miners.
It would also do some interesting things to hosted-email services: They could offer reduced pricing, or even free, while taking a cut/all of the stamp payments to fund the service!

So, the way I understand this, it means the following:
1. This only applies to wallets that are sharing a machine with the attacker. (Shared web-hosting with a hot-wallet in the box.)
1. This requires ~200 sigs from a single key/address, so by moving/merging coins quickly and minimizing key/address re-use, you're not affected, or only minimally affected. Ideally, only use each address for one input and one output, but even keeping it under ~20 sigs total should pretty effectively mitigate this threat.
1. This is specifically a side-channel leak in OpenSSL, which may be fixed in a future OpenSSL update.
Is any of that wrong? If that's all correct, then this is noteworthy but not really a major threat to anyone who was already following the common advice to not re-use addresses.

I have read (though not recently, i need to go revisit them...) those threads before, and drew many ideas from them.
The TL;DR of my proposed data arrangement though is this:
* All headers, back to genesis (~24MB now, growing fairly slowly)
* Full blocks back to N time (I proposed putting N at difficulty adjustments, so 2GB for one period or 4GB for two, if we had 1MB blocks for every single block)
* A UTXO blob of unspent coins from before N (I haven't done the math, but I beleive this is now on the order of ~250MB)
This is somewhere between a full-node and a SPV node. It doesn't have full raw block data (before N), but it *does* have full UTXO data, and it has the entire chain worth of PoW headers, making it as hashpower-secure as a full node. However, I was never suggesting that it should replace full nodes entirely, I just wanted to create an option in the 'gap' between full and SPV nodes. It also happens to work out that by doing it this way, the 'flipped' node also would still be capable of mining even!
The only thing missing here is that I/someone has to come up with a way to keep a reliable (and easy/quick to update) hash of UTXO in the chain itself, to then be protected by the PoW chain.

I'm not familiar with the specific inner workings of Trezor (because I haven't read much about it, since I can't order one yet), but if I were designing a hardware wallet, I would make it so that there is no way to request the private key from the device. Instead, the PC can give the device a tx to sign, and the device shows you a summary of that tx, asks for confirmation using one of the hardware buttons. Once you confirm, the device signs the tx, and gives it back to the PC to broadcast. Now all malware on your PC could do is ask it to sign a stupidly large tx, and you still have to confirm it on the hardware buttons, which you obviously wouldn't do, because you're looking at the tx on the device's screen before you confirm it. I feel like the people involved in Trezor know enough about this to design a system much like that, in which case it is secure from malware on the PC, as long as the human denies incorrect txs. Also, since it is open source, if you're worried, you can check and find out if this is actually how it works.

I probably botched that last point because of the way I removed the nested quotes before going through point-by-point. I responded directly to the specific wording of what I quoted, because I missed the context due to hasty editing, and the quote looks like it's describing generic payment, not deposit. 
You're right, someone who is to *hold* bitcoins for me does require a pretty large amount of trust. That's why I hold the vast majority of my coins myself. The notable exception to that being my bitcointip account, which I only half-hold, since the bot has the key to that also, but I keep it pretty small unless I have a really good reason to move a large coin through it. (I actually did yesterday, in fact, because it was the best way to get funds to a friend who needed them more than me!)
Other than the tip bot though, the only time my coins are on deposit somewhere is when I'm expecting to trade imminently, and when things cool down and I'm done, I withdraw them back to my secure local wallet.
As far as alias-service vs deposit-service levels of trust, I'd say they're almost equal, but they affect opposite sides of the transaction. An alias service can redirect the funds before they ever get to me, while a deposit service can spend my funds after they've arrived. It's a very similar level of exposure.

As everyone here has said, No, not as-is. But it is possible to construct such a [Script](
Here's a script that requires either all three of ABC, or any one of them and D to sign in order to collect enough points:
    // the inputs to the script to verify it. omit any sigs by leaving a 0 in their place.
    &lt;sig_2a&gt; &lt;sig_2b&gt; &lt;sig_2c&gt; &lt;sig_4&gt;
    // checks the last sig, leaves a 4 at the top of the stack if valid, or 0 if not
    // if this sig isn't present, the 0 that held it's place remains.
    &lt;pubKey_4&gt; OP_CHECKSIG 4 OP_MUL
    // swap this 4/0 result down one to look at next sig
    OP_SWAP
    // check it the same way, but this one only counts for 2 points
    &lt;pubKey_2c&gt; OP_CHECKSIG 2 OP_MUL
    // now add this result with the previous one, and swap it down again
    OP_ADD OP_SWAP
    // and another check/add/swap
    &lt;pubKey_2b&gt; OP_CHECKSIG 2 OP_MUL
    OP_ADD OP_SWAP
    // and another check/add
    &lt;pubKey_2a&gt; OP_CHECKSIG 2 OP_MUL 
    OP_ADD
    // stack now contains one item, total points gathered.
    // push minimum points needed on top of it, and test
    // [sigtally]&lt;=[minsigs]
    6 OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL OP_VERIFY
I only used one disabled opcode here, `OP_MUL`. Otherwise (as I understand it), this could be used right now for the script which is hashed for a P2SH address. (Though, it may be difficult to get confirmations on spending, since it would be large, and possibly run afoul of isStandard().)
You could remove the `OP_MUL` by replacing the pattern `&lt;const&gt; OP_MUL` with `OP_IF &lt;const&gt; OP_ELSE 0 OP_ENDIF`, but that's substantially longer.

Either I've horribly misunderstood what you're trying to say, or you didn't actually respond to what I asked, and I'm genuinely not sure which...
I was asking about adding a new opcode to [Script]( similar to OP_CHECKSIG, but using Schnorr instead of ECDSA. CHECKSIG doens't even have to be touched, but once you have multiple algos, it makes sense to rename it for clarity.
Obviously old clients wouldn't understand a TX using the new op, but if it's done right it would just be an unspendable output on old clients. I don't see how you got on the topic of forks from there...

Congratulations, you won some free money. It's the new kind of spam, where they actually *pay* you to ignore their message! (Having the extra dust doesn't make you any more trackable than your unspent contents of cold storage already were, don't worry about it.)
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:52:11


Any reason why this can't be added now as another option in Script? It seems like it would just take a new variation of OP_CHECKSIG. Perhaps rename CHECKSIG to CHECKECDSA, and add a CHECKSCHNORR?

Nothing stays unbroken forever! :)


I'd probably say "Address reuse will increase your risk to future breaks in ECDSA". 
Also, there is the minor privacy leak that if you re-use an address everyone can clearly see that those transactions are all related, since you're using the same keys, but this doesn't (yet) put your coins at risk.
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:06:43

Altcoins aren't taking slices out of the pie, they're making the whole pie bigger. Yes, they draw a few users away from bitcoin, but they also bring in far more users who wouldn't have used cryptos before, and some of those users then come to bitcoin. The net result is more users of cryptocoins overall, and that's a good thing!
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:39:56
Who should receive that BTC "stamp" on the mail? The sender's mail server (in which case spammers are probably paying themselves)? The recipient's mail server? The recipient? Miners? How does the recipient of the "stamp" payment claim it?
Or do you intend to destroy bitcoins every time someone sends an email?

When I swipe my credit card at a retailer, they're giving me credit for the amount of my purchase for a few *days* until the money actually moves between bank accounts (or longer, if you count the period in which a chargeback could happen). When that same retailer accepts a 0-conf bitcoin transaction, they're giving the same amount of credit for about 10 minutes until the first confirmation comes up, except that they've actually seen that I do in fact *have* the money at least before they give credit for that money while it's in-transit. If they wait about 10-15 seconds, that unconfirmed transaction will have made it far enough around the network that it would be more difficult to double-spend against than it's worth for most retail-sized transactions (&lt;$500). For large transactions, the associated paperwork will almost certainly take longer than the transaction confirmation.

Or, you can keep some responsible long-term storage practices, by verifying it's still functional once a year, and updating technology as appropriate. If you're storing &gt;100BTC (or other data of similar value), I'd say it's worth a little time on 1/1 to take care of it...

Not bitcoin related, but Trillian issued a client update (and server update too) because they were affected on the client side. I'm sure others were as well, but don't have any examples off the top of my head.
The vulnerability is *primarily* server-side, but not exclusively so. If the server sends a malformed heartbeat request to an affected client (client software using affected versions of OpenSSL), that client would spit back out chunks of memory the same as a server would. The only thing making this variation of the attack harder is that you have to convince a client to connect to you, while for a server you can just reach out and connect to it whenever you want.

ICANN has a very long history, and well documented security practices. You don't.
When I register domains, I work with companies that have similar security records, not some guy who just started a registrar last week. History is important for establishing trust. Maybe you'll have some one day, but right now the only history you've got that I'm aware of is some reddit karma.


And you system is newer still. But more importantly, you as a certifying authority are newer still. 
That said, upon re-reading the description of what you're doing, it appears I was incorrect on the technical point here, and you are in fact signing correctly, you just described it slightly unusually so it didn't make sense the first time. But I still have no reason to trust your vouching for the validity of an alias.


I use cash quite often. But cash is pretty hard to send to friends online, even when I have already verified their identity. Or to merchants, whose identity I've verified by SSL, and wish to buy goods from.


I will wait, and if you're still around in a year, I might look again. But it's solving a problem I don't have, in a way that adds a requirement for more trust than I would otherwise require. And if I did have this problem, I would use FirstBits, which has been around for years and doesn't introduce any additional trust requirement, since it can be verified by anyone with a copy of the chain. Also, a good way to bootstrap a history of trust is to be vouched for by someone who is already trusted and has known you for some time.


The two are unrelated. I am quite willing to send BTC to an address the person I'm paying controls (no matter where they are!) after verifying that it's actually them, and when I have a reasonable expectation that they'll deliver whatever i'm paying for, based on their history. That's how paying them *works*. But using Bitiom to look it up doesn't in any way reduce the verification requirements, since you are just some guy on the internet, with no skin-in-the-game on my transaction. I still have to ask the other party if I got the right address.
If anything, being an alias service requires *more* trust, since they have the ability to redirect that alias at any time.

"I am Satoshi" would be a fairly easy claim for the real Satoshi to prove: sign a message with the key that was used on a *very* early block's coinbase tx, either from among the set that never moved, or from the one that was spent to generate the first non-coinbase tx (from Satoshi to Hal Finney). Short of that, you'll need a pretty nice mountain of proof to convince a lot of us.

It would allow him to mine more blocks before someone else started, because those few days would have actually been two or three more days than it appeared to be. This of course would only be valuable if he intended to actually use those extra coins, and the biggest evidence of Satoshi's intent I'm aware of contradicts this: all the coins we can identify as Satoshi's are unmoved.

I woudl feel about how I felt when I first hear about it in 2011: This is an amazing technology which will change the world in the same kinds of ways that the internet did, but that it's too early to say exactly what the result of that will be yet. To your edit, I'm primarily type-3 by your list, and "Technologist" seems to be a common word for this kind of interest in technology-becuase-it's-cool.

@_date: 2014-11-28 20:19:40
Not directly comparable, since the algorithms involved are different. Mining is repeatedly running SHA256(SHA256(block)) until you find a result with lots of leading 0 bits. Finding the public key for a not-yet-spent-from address is running RIPEMD160(SHA256(i++)) until you get *exactly* the same result as the address. Finding the private key, given the public key is the ECDSA public derivation from private key i++ until you find the right key.

@_date: 2014-01-30 20:00:32
Well, they still have to give you real bitcoins when you borrow, or else it will be difficult to get people to accept them. This is why it requires a larger reserve to avoid bank runs, while those coins are out as part of a loan, some of the bank's depositors can't withdraw their deposits because someone else has them. When it gets paid back, the bank keeps the interest paid as profit, and returns the funds to the depositor. If it isn't paid back, the bank either covers it out of their other profits (from non-defaulting loans, or any other services they provide), or passes the loss along to their depositor(s) and takes a hit to their reputation. If this happens regularly to this bank, they will eventually fail as all depositors take their money and stay far away from this poorly-managed bank. Basically, they just can't offer credit to uncreditworthy people, like fiat banks love to do.

Actually, they're not. However, the properties of bitcoin-the-currency change when separated from bitcoin-the-protocol. For example, if one coinbase user sends coins to another coinbase user, they're using bitcoin-the-currency, but it's instantaneous, rather than delayed until a block. However, it *is* reversible, because it's all still within Coinbase's control. As soon as those coins are withdrawn to an outside wallet, they rejoin bitcoin-the-protocol, and regain the normal properties we expect of bitcoin-the-currency.

Well, if you can dump it, you can just compare it to one built from github, which takes care of the concern that it may not match the available sources, and then all that's left is review of those sources. Unless of course a tampered bootloader (with an admittedly small window of opportunity for tampering) also causes the bootloader-dumping firmware to return data other than the actual bootloader, but then we're in KT/Trusting-Trust territory again, with no good way out...

Technically, accepting unconfirmed transactions is a form of short lived bitcoin-credit, which is settled at the time the transaction confirms enough times to be irreversible. Other forms of bitcoin credit are entirely possible, but I'm honestly not sure what use it is beyond this specific use case. I've never really understood why people want to use credit to spend money they don't have yet for day-to-day purchases either though, so maybe I just don't get it.
Also, credit does not require fiat, it's just currently primarily denominated in fiat. Credit is based on a trust relationship between the lender and the borrower, as long as you can build that trust with someone, you can support credit.
Fractional reserve is also not required for credit, but it does make it significantly easier (by making more money available to be loaned). Fractional reserve is not impossible with bitcoin, you just have to keep a much larger reserve due to the greater risk (of bank runs, mostly) involved, since there's no lender-of-last-resort to save you when you fuck up. It's exactly the same as running FRB and credit on top of a gold (or other PM) backed currency.

I didn't say mine an empty block. I said mine a HUGE block, then never send anything but the headers.

Otherwise what's the point of getting headers to them faster?

A soft fork is when the only thing making one branch of the blockchain invalid is the existence of a longer one. Both sides of a soft fork are built on the same rules. This happens fairly regularly as miners find blocks at nearly the same time, and one side or the other is usually abandoned almost immediately and eventually forgotten.
A hard fork is when the rules change, so the old rules use one side, and the new rules use the other. This would happen at the first block that uses a feature that the old rules don't handle, or handle differently, and will continue until everyone (or a significant portion of everyone, well beyond majority) upgrades to the new rules, or backs off to the old rules. I believe the last time this happened was the event described in [BIP 50](

Errr, it's not really about voting. My vision of this is that you have a small number of keys that are worth more, so you only need these for day to day use, but you also have a larger number of less-valuable keys, that you can use to recover in case of lost "normal" keys. 
For example, you could have three 3-point keys, and ten 1-point keys, and require 9 points to spend. In normal daily usage, you would use all three of your 'primary' keys, but if something happened, you could pull three of your 'backup' keys to take the place of each lost/damaged primary key.
I suppose you could use this for voting, but it would be pretty impractical. You're also limited to ~15-20 keys max, either by the transaction size or by the number of sig ops, depending on which limit you hit first. It's also a non-standard transaction, so you'll have to find a miner who's willing to mine it for you.
EDIT: I just reread your original post, and realized that you could also make a script which has multiple multi-sig groups (say, three sets each 2-of-3), and require that 2-of-3 of the groups must be satisfied in order to spend the transaction, but I don't have the right set of pre-written Script blocks to do that (yet...)

Only as long as you leave it there, but yes. It's a matter of usage how much is up for grabs at any given moment. Some people had a lot on deposit at Gox. I had none, because they had a history that did not suggest they were a safe place to store coins. (No BTC anyway, there was  still $0.25 there because it wasn't worth the bit-dust to pull that out...)
A deposit service can only affect how the coins on-deposit are spent though, and you really shouldn't ever have all your coins on-deposit anyway. The *only* reason to have coins on-deposit somewhere is to use a service that explicitly requires it for speed, like a high-speed exchange or a broker's escrow service while your ACH/Wire clears. An alias service touches a lot more transaction, if you use it universally, and if you don't, what's the point?

TeamViewer can be configured to use a weak password (either too short/simple, or shared with other services). This allows someone who discovers that password to use your PC as if they were sitting in front of it. Install a keylogger to capture wallet passwords, and copy wallet files.

But there are far fewer good uses for single re-used addresses than there are for continually rotating addresses, and copy/paste,  bitcoin: links and QR codes seem to cover all of those quite well. Submit a patch to one or more major wallets adding support for aliases and you might have an argument for simplicity, but until then using an alias is an *extra* step, not fewer.
We aren't using all FirstBits, because it wasn't bad enough of a problem to actually be worth doing. It still isn't. That's my entire point in mentioning

So, do you compile your open-source system yourself from scratch? If not, how are you certain that the compiled binary you downloaded from somewhere is in fact the same as the source that you reviewed? You *did* review the source yourself, right? Oh, and where did you get your compiler binary that you used to build it all? Are you sure it's not tainted?
Don't get me wrong, I love open source (and use quite a bit of it myself), but the assertion that "Oh, this is open source, it must automatically be secure" is just plain wrong. Security comes from being aware of your system and what's it's doing, not from using only bits with the right shape license sticker on them.
More accurate advice would be "For security purposes, you should carefully examine every component you use in the system, hardware *and* software, to a degree appropriate to your application"
That said, I would still trust pre-news (so, 7.1a) builds of TrueCrypt more than BitLocker, but not by much, and BitLocker (when key management is appropriately configured) would be appropriate for some use-cases.

This is only true for the project as a whole. The parts (specific source files) that came from a project under another license can *also* still be used under their original license, in addition to being reusable under GPL. This is especially clear if you used them unmodified from the other project. Where it gets fuzzy is when those borrowed parts are modified when they get integrated to the GPL'd project, but if they're sufficiently separate to be chopped of as a piece on their own, then they can still be copied under either license. The GPL'd project as a whole, however, can only be used under GPL. I'm personally not a fan of GPL's semi-infectious nature, and avoid it myself when I can for maximal reusability, but it's not actually as bad as people make it out to be.

Multiple copies and multiple locations is also part of responsible long-term storage practices, I was just trying not to turn the thread into a mile-long discussion, so I only replied to the one failing being called out in your prior reply.
Also, there's no reason to *move* coins when testing, just sign a message with the same keys (such as "Today is &lt;year&gt;-01-01 and I am testing my backups", signed with each offline key). Do this from an offline device. You need to have that anyway for withdrawing coins when you eventually want to do that, right?
As far as why a digital backup might be superior to a paper one - flash drive(s) with armory wallets for use on a offline device which gets flattened/reinitialized from ROM on each use. USB/SD would be simpler for returning that data to it than QR codes, and if you have multiple copies anyway and check on them at an appropriate interval, it doesn't really matter what media they're on. You should probably be checking on your paper every now and then too, fire safes have a tendency to get mildew on paper if it's not stored correctly! (But do *NOT* put a desiccant in the fire safe, unless it's inside a sealed container with the thing you're keeping dry, the moisture is what makes it fire resistant! Plastic-potted digital storage tends to care less about the moisture/mildew.)

I actually have no idea what that tx was, I literally pulled up blockchain.info and picked one at random from their recent list. It could be an exchange taking a bunch of deposits and paying a bunch of withdrawals, and doing it in one tx to minimize the fee. It could be a coinjoin tx as part of a mixing service. It could just be someone re-keying a bunch of coins, and sending them all back to themself! Yes, you could collect all the data and try to figure out what's going on, if you cared enough, but it gets very tricky very fast with txs like that one.
In any case, the original question I was responding to was:


We got a bit sidetracked from there, but basically, all txs are equally immutable once they're confirmed, regardless of the history before them, so a newly-minted coin is exactly the same (apart from numerical value) as one of the outputs of that tx I linked.

That's a cool trick, even though in theory it's entirely redundant, it does give you a really nice way to catch a lot of simple things that could go wrong. [Long forks]( would probably be easier to catch this way, and depending on how you handle disagreement, you might even manage to avoid double-spends that take advantage of such an event!

Specifically, TXT records that are a subdomain of *your* domain, not the bitcoin address owner's domain.


SHA-256 sigs the way you use them do not verify authenticity, only well-formed-ness. Similarly, your site mentions a public key for verification, but we have no reason to trust that key, and it's not entirely clear what it's criteria for signing something are.




I'll give you that DNS is currently superior to NameCoin, but that's not a really relevant point.










These two statements seem to conflict with each other. No, it isn't easier to use  because my existing wallet doesn't support it (in fact, I have several different wallets and none of them do).

Firstbits addresses are not fixed-length. A firstbits is the the shortest prefix that uniquely identifies an address *at the time of it's first appearance on the chain*. Any later address which also matches this prefix needs another character to make it unique. 15adMq is only a correct firstbits for the first address you linked, the second would require a longer prefix. The firstbits for the address which received the coinbase payment in the genesis block is just 1.

Buy something from a local shop that takes bitcoin. Pay using a fee-to-p2pool (or other small pool or solo-miner) transaction. Walk out of the shop, and release a double-spend of those inputs (back to yourself) with a fee-to-ghash.io (or other large pool) transaction. GHash will almost certainly get there first, so you get to keep both the goods you just didn't buy, and the bitcoin you didn't buy them with. Alternately, for the second transaction, include a large fee but don't specify the miner at all, to get even higher likelihood of success.
Basically, by allowing miner preference, you're extending the 0-conf time, which allows a longer window for most variations of double-spending attack.

If I wanted to sell BTC via paypal, this is how I'd do it:
1. The seller signs the text of their sale listing with the key currently holding the BTC that are for sale. The listing includes the paypal address to which payment should be sent (or a hash of it, if the listing is public).
1. The buyer signs a statement that they want to by X BTC to be sent to Y address, with the key to that address, and includes this signed statement in the paypal transaction note. They include some form of proof in this signed statement that they are in fact the owner of that paypal account. Alternately, provide this signed statement to the seller directly and include a hash of it in the paypal tx notes.
1. The seller sends from their proven key to the buyer's proven key. The seller also includes a hash of all the signed statements so far (and possibly of text describing the paypal tx) in the bitcoin tx data, for extra proof to tie it all together.
1. The transaction between these two keys gets confirmed on the blockchain. The blockchain now includes proof of the transaction itself, and hashes linking to signed statements from both parties.
Now it's pretty clearly provable that you delivered exactly what you were paid for, and the buyer can't realistically claim "I got hacked".
That said, don't use PayPal. It's against their ToS to use them for bitcoin trades.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:49:16
Changing the txid of a tx before it is included in a block can cause problems for simple tx tracking algorithms that watch for the specific txid. This can cause enough of a problem to prevent a (simple) wallet from successfully spending (or at least make it more difficult), which falls under DoS. If you distribute the txid mangling among many relay nodes throughout the network, it becomes a DDoS. The short-term fix is to pay more attention to transactions that come in with new blocks, and notice when your tx's id got mangling and update your records accordingly. The long-term fix is to eventually make txid mangling invalid in the protocol, and have miners reject non-standard forms.

My point 2 addresses this: the buyer's signed statement includes proof of identity as the owner of the paypal account in question (ebay has nothing to do with it in my example, apart from owning paypal). If the proof is insufficient, I would reject their buy offer, not take their fiat, and not send them any coins. I'm not sure exactly what I would require if I were to make such an arrangement, bit it would likely include at least a photo ID, a picture of their face, and a screen showing paypal with the account name visible, all in a single photo, with no obvious signs of tampering. The hash of this image would go into the buyer's signed message, and the image itself would be sent to the seller. Not that it matters though - I'm not fool enough to trade bitcoin for paypal anyway!

Technically you only proved that you *did* sign v7. There is no (cryptographic) proof that v8 was not signed, only a lack of proof that it was. There are however, non-cryptographic indications that it is not an authentic document, notably the incomplete signature.

The history of a given coin has no bearing on how well-confirmed it's move to a new key/address/script is, that is determined only by the number of confirmations on the transaction that caused that move to happen. Once a transaction confirms, the entire history of that coin before that transaction is irrelevant.
edit: In fact, to talk about a "coin" that has history is kind of misleading anyway. Every transaction takes inputs, which are destroyed, and produces new outputs which have the same or less total value (if less, the difference is the miner's fee). These outputs can be used as inputs to future transactions, but in most cases you can't really tell which input coins became which output coins without making a lot of assumptions about the user(s) who authored the transaction in question.

Yes, but most of those accidental antennas are weak enough that they won't develop power that's outside the ESD ratings of the parts they're connected to.

This sounds like a pretty good start, so basically anyone who owns their own domain can manage it directly, and anyone who uses hosted email has to use a hosted mapping service until they get their mail provider on board? It's workable at least, and has a clear path forward.
 






This record format is a bit unclear, but I think you're trying to describe something that can hold either a single address or a chain, which sounds good to me. The chain being public still means that everyone who looks it up can find all the relevant addresses, but the only alternative I know of, [Stealth Addresses]( involves a significant computation burden on the wallet to recognize incoming transactions, and I've never really liked it for that reason.
Also, what happens if I have a CNAME where the TXT record should be, and it points to a different TXT record? Or, since I have * as email, how do I do default mapping for the domain? Would a TXT record for just _bitcoin.justarandomgeek.com be reasonable? This would be used as a fall-back after trying to look at the name pair, so specific names could still be registered under it, but anything else would go to the catch-all entry.


Properly signing/authenticating these entries is the hard part, and I don't see any obvious answers here either. DNS alone isn't quite good enough, until DNSSec gets much more universal, and that'll take a while yet. PGP could help, but it would be messy, and is almost the direct opposite of a usability improvement. Namecoin could help, with almost the same comment.
Figuring out the authentication process is really the key to making this work, the rest is just arguing about the format of records until enough people agree, and then writing patches for wallets.

The history of the person saying a thing is not an argument against the thing being said, so it's irrelevant. Argue against the thing, not the person. (Basically, would your argument stand up in a forum without *any* names at all? If not, you probably need to work on it.)


So, if we fix all the problems they mention, we all end up with a better system. The only part of this that seems particularly bad is when it's about problems that *are* already solved, but those usually get pointed out in the first two or three replies. Honestly, bitcoin *isn't* ready for more than basic/minimal adoption from people that don't understand the underlying tech at this point anyway, and these kind of dissenting opinions push us towards getting the tech to a state where it *is* ready for more wide adoption.
Since you specifically mentioned hard forks: I've seen a hard-fork, and it is a little scary, but you're right, it's not inherently bad, as long as it's handled well. I've also watched "hard fork changes" be made without any damage to the system, and am a strongly in favor of a few more of them (in particular, adding a deterministic hash of UTXO, as soon as somebody figures out how to quickly generate it, and adding some Script opcodes for other kinds of signature algorithms). That said, these events *could* have gone much worse than they did, because it's an operation mode under which the software has had *MUCH* less testing.
Most of the other problems that the group you are calling "concern trolls" point out (that I've seen, at least) are real problems that need attention though, so we might as well go ahead and talk about them. If we solve it, there's less for them to use "trolling", right?

Bitcoin does have a UTXO set though, which is functionally equivelent to the "current balance" of every non-empty address. Full nodes have this set, but afaik, nobody has yet come up with a way (that enough people agree with) to deterministically generate it in order to put a hash of it in the chain, so they have to build it from the chain. If such a hash can be made/decided on, then it can be embedded in some/all blocks, and you could start form a verified UTXO set, plus recent blocks.

Sacrificing the coins would work, to a point. Eventually, the volume of email would cause us to be sacrificing so many satoshis as stamps, that we wouldn't have many left, and they'd be worth too much to use as stamps! Depending on the form the stamp tx's take, this may also bloat UTXO with a lot of one-satoshi payments that can never be pruned.
Giving stamp payments to miners is somewhat easier: the stamp is a tx with no outputs, and including the hash of the email in the tx. The problem with this is that you're paying an unrelated entity for the mail you're sending.
If you pay recipient's mail server, to help pay for the cost of receiving/processing/storing the message, how much of a fee is appropriate? Should it be a fixed fee, or a floating fee? If floating, how do senders know the current fee? If fixed, how do you deal with the fluctuating value of bitcoin (especially large increases which make what used to be a negligible payment worth far to much to be a stamp)?
And again, how does that receiving mail server claim that fee? Does every domain that receives mail have to publish a key to be used for stamps on mail to that domain? If not, how do you verify that that server is the correct claimant when redeeming that stamp?

I verify most sites I deal with by their SSL cert, and would do the same for reddit, if they would actually support https on every page. That's entirely not my point though. Me using an address that consists of a TXT record at justarandomgeek.bitiom.com (which you own) is an entirely different trust relationship than me using an address that consists of a TXT record at bitcoin.justarandomgeek.com (which I own). In the first case, you as the owner of the domain can change the data there at any time with no input from me, and no notice to me. Suddenly my alias doesn't pay me. In the second case, it's up to *me* to change it.
And before you go off about SSL certs: Yes, the SSL system sucks. But it also works pretty well, and this has been shown *over time*. It's not new. Your system is.


Yes. I have to trust the link over which the person I'm paying gave me an address, or they have to trust the link over which I gave them the address. But why should I add trusting *you* to that? What benefit does that give me? If the link is untrustworthy, I can require some out-of-band verification as appropriate, up to and including meeting face-to-face.


I place a level of trust in these things appropriate to their demonstrated history of trustworthiness. You currently have no history, so that's a bad comparison.

They can. That's pretty much the definition of a 51% attack. It would be far more profitable for them to mine and keep the new coins. Also, the cost of performing this attack is [very high]( and has a [general long-term upward trend](

Why would 99% switch off? Why would they do it all at once? I'm assuming this was part of the original bait-post at the top that has since been removed?
In any case, *any* amount of miners switching off makes all other miners more likely to find the next block, *eventually*. The timing of blocks will slow down until the retarget, but all remaining miners are getting more coins than they previously would have, becuase they're not competing as much.
@_date: 2016-03-28 21:57:34
Yes, miners do. But only under the rules that we've all agreed to by using bitcoin in the first place: with new blocks, in the quantity given by the decay-every-four-years curve.

IIRC, the intent was for it to fail-fast, so that if a sig failed to verify it wouldn't bother calculating the rest of them. I don't think I ever got far enough to actually build real transactions with them though, and there wasn't a tool like this at the time, so I couldn't actually test them, so there probably are bugs! Basically, if a check passes, then the script continues on to the next part of that 'block', which adds to the score tally for the final assembled script. I originally used the non-VERIFY versions and switched them after some discussion (which i can't find now) on reddit with more active (at the time - over a year ago) bitcoin devs.
The intent was to use the start/stop block at each end, and one or more of the verification blocks in the middle to build whatever variation you want.
Edit: it would help in finding exactly where this is going wrong if you could print the state of teh stacks after each instruction!
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:30:39
Yep, pretty much exactly my issue with almost every database-backed (and for this one, DNS is just another database) alias service out there. The only secure way to do short addresses I've seen is a deterministic chain-based algorithm like FirstBits, where anyone with a copy of the chain can produce the same results. 
I guess you could also vanitygen an address that has lots of 0's at the end, and then leave them off, but that's not really practical due to the calculation time needed to find those.

The main problem is that PGP and SSL use different kinds of pub/priv crypto. SSL mostly (only?) uses RSA, where keys tend to be 2048 bits (older keys are 1024, but most new keys are 2048 or larger). If we had Script opcodes for RSA signatures, you could use one of these in a P2SH transaction, using the keys as-is. PGP supports RSA and DSA, so a similar answer there.
Currently bitcoin only supports ECDSA signatures, so those are the only types of keys you can use directly.

You can sort of do daily limits only putting a day's worth in the Mycelium address at a time, and holding the rest in a "savings" address in Electrum. If the kids need some out of savings, they can ask for it and give a reason.
The kids could game this by manually creating a second address in Mycelium and slowly drawing coins over to it. That would show up as repeated small withdraws to the same address (with an increasing balance) though, so OP could spot it fairly easily if actively monitoring.

So, if you click the word "Output" next to the input, it'll link to the previous transaction that generated the output being spent here.
The script for that previous transaction was
    OP_HASH256 6fe28c0ab6f1b372c1a6a246ae63f74f931e8365e15a089c68d6190000000000 OP_EQUAL 
This hashes the content pushed on the stack by the redeeming transaction, and compares it to a constant. If it passes, I believe the OP_EQUAL would then trigger P2SH processing to run the script provided in the redeeming transaction: 
    0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003ba3edfd7a7b12b27ac72c3e67768f617fc81bc3888a51323a9fb8aa4b1e5e4a29ab5f49ffff001d1dac2b7c
A "normal" P2SH uses the OP_HASH160 opcode instead of OP_HASH256, but otherwise this looks to be just a slightly non-standard P2SH. If I get bored later I may come back and decode that redeeming script to see what it does...
EDIT: either that or being a HASH256 instead of HASH160 means that it *doesn't* get P2SH processing and it's just "give me the data that hashes to this and you get 1BTC".

Satoshi's brilliance wasn't in inventing any particular part of bitcoin - all the parts already existed. Git is a chain of state-updates that referenced the previous state in the new one. Various PoW schemes existed to prove that someone expended computing power. Bytecode scripting systems existed. P2P networks existed. Public key crypto existed. The brilliant thing was putting those pieces together in the right way to create something that *didn't* exist - a PoW token that can be reliably independently verified by anyone within the P2P network that issues it.

A miner's "Luck" is how many blocks they mined in a given interval (day, week, etc) compared to how many they expected to mine given the ratio of their hashing power to the rest of the network.
So, if a pool had 1% of all the hashing power, you would expect them to get ~1% of all the blocks. But because mining is a random process (with high variance), one day they might mine 2% of the blocks, and then they might only get ~0.5% the rest of the week. So, that day they had very high luck, then the rest of the week they had very low luck. Overall, for the week as a whole then had slightly lower than normal luck.

You should fix the formatting for IPv6 addresses - You're currently displaying them like 2001:15c0:65ff:610::2:8333 (picked from a search for "::"), which is ambiguous as IPv6 only or IPv6+port. The correct way to display this is [2001:15c0:65ff:610::2]:8333, with brackets around the literal IPv6 address.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:19:41

Hrm. You seem to be saying that any large portion of miners switching off would immediately make others less profitable, but I just don't see it. In the immediate term, the other miners are throwing the same amount of hash power at the same difficulty, so they'll get the same results. In the moderate/long term, they're throwing the same hash power at a now decreasing difficulty, so they'll make more.
I'm also not sure why you think that it'll be 99%, rather than a few percent here and there, which is *far* more likely. If 10% turned off today, that wouldn't prompt other miners to quit, if anything it would prompt those who are currently not mining to jump in after the next difficulty change.
The exchange rate dropping is a separate issue from the miners-switching-off cascade you're claiming will happen, and it may also cause some miners to drop out, but it will be a relatively small portion. It also serves to confuse the issue and make it harder to discuss, so let's leave it aside for now.
And for the sake of argument, what do you see happening if 1% were to switch off today? 5%? 10%? 20%? 50%? How would these lead to 99%? What would cause these different levels?
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:12:49

@_date: 2016-03-14 14:56:02
Possibly relevant - the bitcoin application as it is automatically advertises multiple addresses if the system it's running on has multiple addresses. I discovered this because I've been monitoring my home node more recently (due to anti-DDoS measures, notably being IPv6-only), and noticed that several peers were connecting to me twice (or more!), using two different addresses for me. Bitnodes in particular actually had a total of three connections when I went to track down what was going on - one each to my DHCPv6 and SLAAC addresses from their regular node, plus one from their counter node that would jump among them. I also saw nodes at times connecting to the Privacy-Extension addresses that Windows enables by default. It's entirely possible that I'm not the only one with an accidentally-doubled node. IMHO we should probably count nodes within the same /64 as a single entity.

Okay, bugreports:
1. A blank ScriptSig seems to expand into a very large chunk of data, rather than being an empty stack going in to ScriptPubKey. I'm working around this for now by moving my first push to ScriptSig.
~~2.  ScriptSig of `OP_1` and ScriptPubKey of `OP_1 OP_EQUALVERIFY` returns `Invalid (EvalFalse)`, despite only checking for 1==1~~
~~3.  ScriptSig of `OP_1` and ScriptPubKey of `OP_VERIFY` returns `Invalid (EvalFalse)`, despite being a OP_VERIFY of OP_TRUE (though, you don't seem to accept OP_TRUE - I'm using OP_1 because [this page]( lists them as equivalent.)~~
~~EDIT: ScriptSig `OP_1` and ScriptPubKey of `OP_1 OP_EQUAL` passes - are you adding an implicit extra OP_VERIFY after the end of your execution? As I understand it a completely empty stack after the last instruction should be considered valid, do you have something that contradicts that?~~
EDIT2: I reread more carefully and it seems I'd misunderstood the very final step. I'm supposed to leave the last True on the stack.
EDIT3: given the above realization, I've now tested the start/stop block and all the verification blocks except "MULTISIG PUBKEY HASH WEIGHTED SIG GROUP", since that one was never finished, and "CONTENT WEIGHTED HASH" because I'm not sure how to get in the constants easily for it. I've also updated my original link to remove the OP_VERIFY from the end block, which is the change required to make it behave properly. I'm working on testing my hacky multipliers now.
Also, It would be nice if it returned a helpful error if it fails to parse one or both scripts, rather than returning nothing at all.

That would only work if there was an existing signed tx with nLockTime set to your deadline.

SHA256 and RIPEMD160 both being cracked would still only give you *public* keys for addresses, you'd need to also break ECDSA to get private keys from that.
A more interesting result would be a break in double-SHA256, which would make mining very easy until the difficulty automatically adjusts again. But even that is pretty tame, as it would look just like a new generation of mining hardware from the blockchain's perspective - ramp up difficult and continue business as usual.

@_date: 2014-09-18 23:58:12
Well, it's true that you lose some layers - When coins are sent to an address, they're sent to RIPEMD-160 of sha-256 of the public key. In order to spend it, you reveal the public key, and then sign with the corresponding private key. Thus, if at some point in the future someone discovered a weakness in ECDSA that allows deriving the private key from the public key, a re-used address would be more vulnerable, as it's public key would already be on the blockchain, while a single-use address would only have a hash of the public key. (Of course, if the attacker *also* has a hash-inversion attack, that doesn't help much, but it's unlikely that all three algos would break at once!)
Not sure if I'd call it "half as safe", but it's certainly "not as safe"!

If you want some more examples of interesting script fragments to include, [here's a few]( I wrote a while back when I was thinking about building a generator for weighted multisig transactions. I never really did anything with it beyond writing them up, but if you want to do something useful with them, by all means copy them!
Edit: For example, you could use these to make a P2SH address in which 2-of-3 from one group need to sign, plus 1-of-5 from another. Or one where 3-of-8 is enough, or one super-key counts as two, needing only one of the of-8 keys. Pretty much any combination you can think of.

It's usually a thing that happens while I'm preparing for some upcoming event (Conventions, HvZ games, travel, etc), and as I'm going down my checklist, I may have a handful of items I have to buy, but because they're not necessarily together in the list, they each get a one-click order. They handle it nearly equivalent to a single order with all the items in the cart anyway, and it's simpler for me because I don't have to go back and finalize the whole order at the end.

I think the parent point was that attempts to block a particular message being said sometimes mean that the message in question should have more critical thinking applied to it. It doesn't necessarily mean good/bad about either side, but it means there's something else to consider. Notably, who is blocking what message and why? If it's spam/scam, then it's probably okay to block it. If it's just discussion of something unpopular, maybe more consideration should be put into why it's being blocked.

For the record, I do feel a little bad for tearing up your project here, as a developer myself, I do know how that feels, it's been done to me quite a few times.
But you're solving a problem that hasn't really been a problem since FirstBits was published a couple years ago, or more recently, since address re-use started being strongly discouraged by basically everyone, making single-address aliases kind of silly.
If anything, to be useful an alias would have to resolve to "the first unused address in this deterministic wallet", but even that would have pretty strong de-anonymizing properties, since the alias service would know all of your addresses, and depending on how it's stored/published, so might everyone else. I can't think of a good way to do that, but if you come back with a good low/no-trust solution there, I may well sign up for that!
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:10:08
You'd probably want choices like RBF=(Reject|Allow|Require), to accurately express the situation.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:39:40
So basically, even if the limit were higher, those transactions wouldn't get mined anyway right?
@_date: 2016-01-06 20:27:56
I agree, but it's done the way it is in bitcoin for a reason (even if the attack it's preventing is currently a (purely?) theoretical one - a breach to ECDSA that allows deriving privkey from pubkey+sig), and voting on an online petition that won't actually change anything isn't a sufficient reason (for me at least) to go around that. My savings wallet is also just legitimately a pain to access (on purpose!), so the bar for "worth doing" is pretty high there.
If my pocket-change wallets had little enough movement, I'd probably go ahead and sign with those, but there's a pretty solid chance those keys would expire quickly anyway, and nobody would notice that drop in the bucket anyway. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:09:46
Yes, if after all that you have determined it's malice, you then have two separate things to consider:
1. If the filter you're using is broken, how can you fix it?
2. What is the value of the message(s) that got incorrectly blocked, and what (if anything) needs to be done with that information now that you have it?
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:12:37
Amazon. I frequently end up placing multiple (often unrelated, other than timing) single-item orders (with the one-click order button, no cart involved) back to back, and they batch them together for shipping if they're close enough in time. In fact, to deal with people who use the system like this, they seem to wait ~30+ minutes after an order before actually starting the process anyway. They could just give me a payment request that updates the prior transaction for each subsequent order, until the chain catches it, and we start the next transaction.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:31:56
It's interesting that everyone read "They don't seem to be listening" as "they aren't listening", and responded to it that way. If you're going to assume your users are not technically inclined, then the explanations for what's happening that go back to them need to be simple enough that they understand that their request is actually being handled and taken care of in a satisfactory way. Telling the users to shut up because their preferred implementation is wrong (whether the users have the technical merits to actually pick it or not), and generally ignoring the repeated request is not exactly great customer service. A good dev team can communicate clearly with both machines and users, but lately we seem to have teams that primarily do one or the other.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:58:34
Thus starting with the "if" ;)
But you completely ignored the other half of my comment: The *actual* limit to the size of the blocks that get created is how much orphan risk the miners are willing to take in exchange for the fees offered. If miners are currently mining 1MB blocks, then they must believe their profitability balance point is greater than 1MB, but they have to stop there or else their orphan risk suddenly spikes to 100% point due to the current hard-coded limit.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:00:45
Yeah, it's not "This was blocked, it must be right", it's "this was blocked, why? what is this message worth?". Then, if upon review you decide that the message shouldn't have been blocked, then you ask "well who blocked it? why did they do it?", and see if it was malice or mistake!
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:00:23
If that's the case, then it is because teh balance point is above 1MB. Or, the miners who are currently all-inclusive may change their policy beyond 1MB as they change their opinion on what is/n't profitable.

I'm replying twice because I didn't quite get this part the first time. Yes, the headers will get through to everyone faster, but nothing useful changes until the *full body of the block* gets to everyone who wants it (SPV nodes need not apply, they actually *are* helped by this...), which still requires sending all the same data through the same connections. Until that happens all you know is "New (potential) block incoming!"

I would sign this with a few hundred BTC, but that would require pulling keys out of storage, and would then require moving those coins to keep them safe (because signing anything would expose the same information as moving the coins, making it equivalent to address-reuse...)
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:48:55
As I understand it, they have pledged to run a piece of software that meets a certain spec when it is available. If it doesn't meet the spec agreed to (which seems to be fork-to-2MB-and-stop, but I'm not in all the conversations, so I'm not 100% certain on that), I'm sure there will be backpedalling on the pledges, but it currently looks like it *will* match the spec, and thus it seems likely the entities that pledged will follow through.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:48:13
If the blocks aren't already at 1MB, then the limit is not the reason the txs in question are not being included. It will continue to not be the reason when it is raised. Miners reject transactions which are not profitable (fee per byte vs orphan risk per byte) for them to mine, therefore the actual block size settles out to the balance point between orphan risk and miner profitability.
@_date: 2016-01-06 08:44:46


That's pretty much my entire point - If I voted, I'd then immediately have to move the coins, thus invalidating my vote, because...






Signing a statement is exactly the same key/example-signature exposure of signing a tx, and thus in all but the de-anonymizing effect, is the same as address reuse.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:18:33
It's not really mixing, since it's the same coin over and over. My guess is somebody who should have used a sendmany is instead doing individual small payments from a large coin in rapid succession.

Well, it is one of the two primary reasonings behind the advice against address reuse - a signature also exposes the pubkey, which would otherwise be hidden behind the hashing that obscures it into an address. In any case, adding ~10% to the votes on that proposal isn't nearly worth the effort I'd have to go to in order to still be satisfied that my coins are safely stored on never-seen-before keys. It's a rather large portion of my total wealth (it wasn't when it started...), so I'd rather play it overly safe ;)
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:57:08


So why wouldn't miners offer these nodes a small portion of the increased fee to withhold the transactions for a few blocks, and then send it to them first?
Edit: I guess you would just send it to multiple nodes, and assume that at least one of them will behave properly, just like the rest of the system?
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:10:56

@_date: 2016-01-30 06:57:08
As the block reward drops the incremental orphan risk of each additional transaction will matter more, and will require gradually rising fees to make the transaction profitable to include in the block. Miners will not mine unprofitable transactions (unless there is some outside influence that makes them profitable), which places a natural upper limit on block size. No hardcoded limit will be required, nor an event "hitting" it.

1MB is an artificial limit, there is actually code that checks for "is this &lt;1MB". This is relatively easy to change. 32MB is a protocol limit, some fields would need to be made larger to accommodate larger than this. This is a much larger change, so it is better left for a future update, when it can get much more thorough testing.

Actually, that's pretty much what's happening.

By doing it this way, the new coin is immediately useful also, because a large enough portion of the userbase already accepts it.

As I understand it, a sidechain is a second chain which instead of being mined directly, has it's header hash included in the blocks of the main chain. This allows it to serve as extension space, which only needs to be loaded and processed if you need transactions from that sidechain. You could theoretically have multiple sidechains, even going so far as to have nothing *but* sidechains in the main chain, and each node would load/process the ones relevant to it. I might be confusing multiple scaling solutions though.
In any case, this definitely *IS* a good idea for scaling (it has different properties at-scale from a bigger-blocks solution, notably not requiring every node to touch every single transaction), but we have no working code for it at all at the moment (and IIRC, it would require some forking changes to the main chain to implement), so it's not a viable solution for the problem we have *right now*. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:17:24
The 32MB limit exists whether BIP100 acknowledges it or not. Acknowledging it makes it official, so we are less likely to get an accidental fork around it.

I think you're missing a negative in here somewhere
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:55:07
I never said it was in their interests to do it. I was just saying that this is not a new capability because of larger blocks, or miner voting on block sizes. They already control the blocksize, within the 1MB limit, and they will continue to control it under BIP 100 or 101, within the new limits those establish. They already somewhat set fees, as any miner is free to mine, or not, any given transaction as they see fit. Market forces prevent them abusing this, because if they ask too high a fee they're missing out on profit.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:26:06


This is only *technically* needed to show old (coins that have now been spent) history that it did not itself create. Unspent transactions will never be pruned, so it should be able to collect balances and spend coins through a pruned node. It would need a full node at some point to build history, but in theory it could function without history using a pruned node.


I'm not actually low on space, I want to enable pruning because I think that's the way things ought to be.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:54:03
Actually, the way bitcoin multisig works, you can attack keys one at a time until you have enough signatures. It *is* more work, but only linearly more, not orders of magnitude more.

This is not a robust fee market. This is spam forcing a baseline minimum. The only reason this is currently working is because "well, we'll just skip those transactions" is an acceptable solution for now, because "those transactions" are not real users. If this overload condition were caused by real users, we would need a real increase in capacity.
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:40:24
A fork caused by (and double-spend allowed by) version differences affects end users just as much as one that results from any other kind of vulnerability. The only current defense against this is to maintain a current understanding of the status of the network.
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:00:32










So, your solution to reaching transaction-handling capacity is to *broadcast more transactions*. What could possibly go wrong with that plan...
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:07:00
Keep the headers yourself. You can verify the block headers, then if you need the full block you can obtain it from any available source, verify the hash, and do whatever you needed it for. The block payload is hashed in the header, and the header is protected by the PoW chain, and thus can't be tampered with. All of the chain's security guarantees are still valid. The header-chain is small enough that it won't be a significant burden to store for the foreseeable future.

@_date: 2015-07-18 17:43:56


Actually, the test(s)/attack(s) have shown that it *does* break: we've had to resort to simply dropping a large portion of transactions to deal with the load. This is only an acceptable workaround because nobody actually cared about those transactions in the first place. If they had been transactions from real users, the system would be considered entirely broken.

This is my concern - I'd *like* to turn on pruning and reclaim some disk space, but armory is my largest wallet, and I don't really want the long rebuild going back if it doesn't work. I know Armory has it's own database though, and theoretically speaking a pruned node would still contain enough information for it to all function (since it has to keep at least all of UTXO)...
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:48:59


If it takes 10 years it will be too late. We are running out of block space in the next year (two tops), and we need a solution NOW, and the only viable (ready for deployment) one is a blocksize increase. This buys the years needed to work on other solutions, which may in the long run end up better.
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:03:51
Not with that attitude!

I'm on the fence about this also, but the thing that makes me lean towards "they're spam" is that they don't seem to care all that much about waiting in the mempool indefinitely. If they were "real" transactions, then getting into blocks eventually would be pretty significant to their usefulness.

It's hard to say who's right, because both sides have merits, but there are two big things that have me in the bigger-blocks camp:
1. Bigger blocks are ready to roll out now. The other solutions are at least a year away from having code ready, let alone actually beginning to roll out.
2. Satoshi's intent with the limit was pretty clear - it was meant to be temporary, and to be removed entirely (which would actually shift it up to 32MB, a protocol limit) once we are ready. An 8MB or floating limit is the compromise on this intent to satisfy those who say we aren't ready to go that far.

Nothing at all. In fact, this is pretty much the desired result. It's still a hardfork though, as pre-update versions would not be able to handle the post-fork chain.

As I understood it the reason for the wide time window was the potential scenario where an honest miner has a dishonest time source, for some reason. I'm not sure if this is actually a reasonable thing to defend against, though, given that the bitcoin network itself provides a *rough* backup time source (though, again, a potentially dishonest one - it's just your adjacent nodes). 
It seems pretty reasonable to me to shrink the window to +/- 10 minutes (or maybe 5?), which leaves time for slow propagation/validation, but still dramatically improves the accuracy of the timestamping. I would love to see some research on how much this could be tightened without breaking anything, and what breaks when as the window tightens!

Well, with the current state of the tech, to truly be safe, you *do* need to have an understanding of the state of things. Eventually the tech will progress to the point that that's no longer necessary, and for the most part we're close enough that most people get away with not already, but we're not yet at the point where a user could blindly keep transacting safely under fork conditions.

Signing this statement would:

The disagreement already exists. The way to turn it into agreement/consensus is to work out exactly what the disagreement is, and work from there towards something agreeable. For example, the original proposals for various flex-caps where too far, so they were pulled back progressively until the 2MB fork was reach as the point at which agreement/consensus appears to be possible.


BIPs are one of the ways to *propose* changes. Releasing code is another. Either way it's just a *proposal*. Hardforking is the entire process from proposal through to acceptance or rejection (by miners/users, which is why they're involved). The change doesn't happen until it's accepted and becomes the new consensus.
It's just an election. That's all.

Right. I followed my own thoughts too far and forgot my context. Of course removing it would be a hard fork. A soft fork to make it more precise would be much preferable though.
@_date: 2016-02-06 23:56:45
Eh, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's unimportant enough to remove. It's still useful, even though it's fuzzy. There's a window of allowed inaccuracy, so you can still use it to prove something occurred on a given day, for example. If the timestamps are going to change, it would be much better to improve the accuracy of them, assuming that it can be demonstrated that that's technically feasible. I, at least, am not convinced that they're wrong enough to be worth changing at this time, and I suspect I'm not the only one. Also, even if they are, because it's a change that makes rules stricter, it would only be a soft fork anyway.

Time in computing is inherently unreliable. Jumping forward and back in time is a fairly regular occurrence when dealing with data passed among widely distributed systems. The passage of time may be objective, but the numbers assigned to it are entirely subjective.

@_date: 2016-02-04 22:16:19
The desired outcome of a hardfork is everyone agreeing on a set of rules. This happens either by the new rules being rejected, and the fork failing, leaving the original rules, or by the new rules being accepted by all clients, adopting the new rules. Either case is the desired outcome of continued consensus.
Core adding the 2MB jump would be the main holdout dissenting client agreeing to the new proposed rules. Core not adding it and being "voted out" by miners/users (which by your own argument's assumption, support the change) would be the network's consensus deciding that Core is incompatible, and leaving it behind.
Hardforking *is* the governance structure of bitcoin.

Per-transaction, their costs for bitcoin transactions may actually be higher because there are so many fewer of them, and they generate comparatively much more support work (answering these emails). Not 66% higher, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's 20% or so more expensive for them

I discussed this with someone a while back and we came up with using the current block height (at the time you generate the transaction) as an index into the address-chain pointed to by the alias. It's still one linked-together identity, but that's pretty much impossible to *not* do with an alias, and at least you're now less likely to re-use individual addresses. On the recipient side, your wallet just needs to look in each block for addresses that would be valid using that block's index or ~10 or so back (more/less as you see fit, and depending on actual usage).

When you spin the drive, most of the energy comes out as heat from the motor. The remainder goes into the spinning of the platter, and *eventually*, comes out as heat when the platter slows down eventually. It still goes into the room, just not all at once. Similarly, when you change the state in the CPU, a lot of your energy is lost as heat in the transition, thus the large heatsink/fan on your CPU. A little bit stays in holding the state, but only until you turn it off, eventually everything settles back to it's lowest energy state, by letting off all the 'extra' energy as heat.
This is also how/why the eventual end of the universe is the "heat-death" - all the energy has transformed to heat, and there's no transitions left to make gains from the side effects of.

@_date: 2015-11-24 17:41:40
Well, in theory merely weakening SHA would only require a corresponding increase in difficulty - it's exactly equivalent to developing faster ASICs! It's only in the event of a complete break that it actually needs to be swapped out!
As far as how it'd be done, I see a few potential strategies:
1. The most obvious potential strategy, get *literally everyone* on board and do a cutover at some arbitrarily chosen (and agreed on) point in time.
2. Create a new chain and transition everyone to it at their own pace (either with exchanges, or by allowing a 'burn' on the old chain to create the equivalent number of coins on the new chain.
3. Create some conversion between the two types of PoW, and allow both for a while, but eventually discontinue SHA. Possibly by varying the relative difficulties to discourage SHA at the end.
2 and 3 are "smoother" paths, but still require very large degrees of coordination. 1 is the hardest of hard forks, but gets it all done in one action. I think 2 is probably the most likely result in a SHA-is-badly-broken scenario, probably primarily with a burn-to-move strategy, though I would very much like to see strategy 3 in action!

Once they are using it and relying on it, it is in their interest to at least run one or more full nodes, and possibly to invest in some mining.

@_date: 2015-09-09 01:17:53
There is a cost to the miner for each additional transaction they include: increased orphan risk. In the absence of a hard limit, a rational miner will continue adding transactions to the block as long as the fee justifies the increased risk, and no further. This will establish a 'natural' block size at the balance between fee size and orphan risk, so low-fee transactions will have to wait until there is space below the orphan threshold.

I can't answer your actual question here, but as far as how to get there, the QR Code has the address in it, from which you can look it up on any blockchain explorer: 
From there, you can see that it has received one transaction, for the amount shown in your screenshot (and strangely, this transaction has two change coins... did you pay two things at once? EDIT: nevermind, I see your other comments mention you used Coinbase, this is probably a quirk from them. Shouldn't affect anything.).

The rest of the wallet depends on the wallet, OP said they're using coinbase, so that will obscure the linkage a little bit, but still not ideal. I didn't actually follow the "back to merchant" link to see what it was, but if that's the case perhaps hiding things might actually be a reasonable idea! (OP, you should have hidden at least half of the QR Code, and the random-looking tag at the end of the URL too, apparently!)

The protocol does not require miners to include anything beyond a block header. It does, however, allow users to *encourage* miners to include their transactions by offering fees. As the subsidy declines, fees will become more significant to miners' incomes, and there will be actual market competition to get into blocks, which will eventually set fees at a level that is acceptable to both miners and users. (Users won't pay it if it's too high, miners won't include tx if fee is too low, somewhere they meet in the middle.)

Usually special QR codes are made by starting with a QR code with more error correction than it would normally have, and then just replacing part of it with the design. It's *technically* full of errors, but they're all correctable, so it still works.

Nothing is custom-hardware resistant forever. It's an impossible design goal to create something that is - once an algorithm exists, you can always develop custom hardware which is better at that task than a general machine would be. The nature of the algorithm in question only affects what the properties of that specialized machine are.

Perhaps you have a wildcard address in a custom domain, so they still all go into one box, but now you know if you get mail about coinbase and it's not sent to the address you gave them, it's fact.

@_date: 2015-02-10 19:06:34
I think the main issue is that some people are working under the theory that if we increase the block size, then fees will never increase enough to pay miners. This is of course faulty logic, as miners can simply refuse to include transactions in their blocks that don't have enough fee-per-byte, which will eventually drive fees up as needed, under market forces, rather than under an artificially limited supply.

Because you'll check in on your long-term holdings occasionally, probably at the same time as some other long-cycle (probably yearly) maintenance, at least in the form of confirming that technology has not made it obsolete. When this happens, you go ahead and upgrade it with the next 10-year plan.
Also, In 10 years, worst case you can run the old version of armory that you saved with your backup keys and use it to export private keys to use in a newer client, if needed. If you intend anything to last over that timescale, you need to provide the software to use it with, in case software changes make your old data incompatible, this is no different.

Interesting, I had not considered the possibility of a malicious relay trying to attack the now-signed sweep before it makes it into a block (or at least solidly into the collective mempool)! I guess there is a small window of a few seconds in which receive-once-send-once is more secure than receive-many-send-once.

Isn't it technically still safe until you send *from* it? Since that's the point at which the available information to an attacker changes, from a pubkey hash to a pubkey+sig(s), that's the event you want to minimize.

But if the data in the block is encrypted with a key that doesn't become available until an hour later, then at minimum you must wait for that key before the block does you any good, thus extending your 1-block minimum wait to 1-block-plus-an-hour-for-keys.

If you *only* want it to store keys and sign transactions, then it's possible with the larger chips, like on the Mega: the EEPROM is big enough to store lots of keys, and the RAM is big enough to store several whole transactions, so it could certainly hold a TX and all it's input TXOs. From there it's just a matter of the time which mostly comes down to "how fast can you do ECDSA on an 8-bit chip?" [This site]( claims they can do a signature in 12 seconds, and a verification in 24. It'll take a while, but it'll sign.
That's about all you could do with it though, a very optimistic estimate of 2 signatures per transaction, puts the time for ECDSA verification alone (ignoring all other hashing work etc) at over 90 years for the chain so far.

As I understand it (someone please correct me if I'm wrong...), if the miner (or relay node, since txs are verified before being relayed) has already seen the first transaction, and has it in their memory pool (and thus verified it's validity), then the second is invalid, regardless of fee, because it is attempting to spend outputs which have already been spent.

At the moment, yes, all my bitcoins. And that's not a small number. If/when such a weakening occurs, my opinion may change based on how it is dealt with, but I won't know until then. None of the algos used by bitcoin are new just for it, it's just another user of them, and people have been banging on them for a while.
How much are you willing to bet in the other direction (by paying someone to search for the break, for example)?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:08:17
A digital signature is just a hash encrypted using the private half of a public/private key pair. This is how the public half allows you to validate it, anyone can decrypt the signature, and compare the result to a hash they took of the content being verified using the same algorithm as the original signer.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:42:46
Well, the simplest answer is that it would then work the way pre-paying with cash does: you go inside and pay, then go back to get change if needed. This is probably what the first iteration of buying gas with bitcoin will look like.
The next iteration will probably use a nLockTime payment channel: there is a pre-signed but delayed transaction for the full potential amount, then throughout the transaction (or just when you finish pumping) you update that with a valid-now transaction sending how much you've spent so far to the pump and the rest back to yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:46:20
It's theoretically possible for a block to exist which has no nonce that produces a hash which satisfies the current difficulty. However, that particular version of the block would be unique to the particular miner working on it (the 'coinbase' transaction issuing new coins/fees to the miner would have a unique address), and even if all miners managed to make such 'impossible' blocks at once, as soon as the next transaction is braodcast they can add it to get a new nonce-space to search.
There is no theoretical maximum, other than the time to do an exhaustive search of possible nonces, but the odds of it taking a given time or longer decrease as you increase that threshold past the target of 10 minutes.
EDIT: And to answer OP's question: The theoretical fastest possible six confirmations would be if you managed to get your transaction with enough priority that it went into the first block solved after you broadcast it, and that miner managed to construct six blocks in a row which met their difficult target on the first nonce attempt. This would take on the order of a few seconds, mostly for your transaction and the resulting blocks to be broadcast to the rest of the network. The odds of this happening are effectively 0. A slightly slower version would be if multiple miners constructed those six first-nonce blocks, but there would be additional broadcast delays in that case. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:26:17
Miners get transaction fees *on top of* the base block reward, and the size of those fees is determined by whoever created the transactions. Currently a 0.1mBTC fee is useful, but back when I first got into BTC it was not uncommon to put a 0.01BTC fee on a complicated transaction. As the block rewards drop, transaction fees get more important for miners, so they'll settle out (by market forces) at some level where it is cost effective for them to mine, but not too costly for people to use.

@_date: 2013-12-26 00:34:09
A race double spend doesn't require a lot of resources, but requires very good timing within a very short window. Once you (or the merchant) broadcast the first transaction (txA, paying the merchant), you have only a few seconds to transmit the second transaction (txB, spending the same outputs at txA, but sending them to yourself) to have any chance of getting it accepted. Once a node in the network sees txA (and accepts it into it's mempool of transactions for the next block), it will refuse txB as invalid, since it's inputs are already spent by txA. So, if txA is small (payment for a sandwich, coffee, etc), then the recipient just needs to wait ~5-10 seconds and watch to see if anyone tries to broadcast a txB, and if not they can be reasonably confident that their funds are secure, and provide goods/services as relevant. If the payment is large (for a car, house, boat, etc) they will likely have some paperwork to do anyway while they wait for a few (1-10, depending on tx size) blocks to be mined to 'lock-in' that transaction before they accept it.

My current wallet is not as well protected as it should be, honestly, so I'm not going to describe it! But I'm going to rearrange things soon to use a hot and cold wallet, with at least the cold being deterministic, and probably both, so that I don't have to rekey often. The cold wallet will then have a physical copy, probably a QR code physically carved into a block of metal (or otherwise embedded in a physical thing) in a fireproof safe (the primary copy), and some subset of the following as backups (I haven't quite finished planning this out yet):
* another metal block in a Safe Deposit box
* another metal block in a friend/relative's (fireproof?) safe
* a truecrypt volume on an SD card in a friend/relative's (fireproof?) safe
* a truecrypt volume on S3/Box/other cloud providers
Any of those options will require at least a password in addition to the thing, and I may even split it up as M of N shared across such places, leaving only the "primary" metal block (in my possession) with the whole key for my own convenience when I do decide to withdraw from it (to buy a Tesla eventually, for example). Any signing with cold private keys would be done offline, and then the signed transaction sneaker-net'd back to my hot wallet node (or any node, really) for broadcasting.
Oh, and here's a little to get you started!

Such vulnerabilities don't appear overnight, they appear first as a widely publicized minor weakening many years before they develop into a full "break", if they ever even do. This would give us plenty of time to upgrade the clients and move all coins to a stronger algorithm once enough/all of the online nodes support it.

That page seems to describe using a hash function (they use SHA1 as an example, but any sufficiently secure hash works) and then applying elliptic curve cryptography on that result to make it authenticated, unless I'm skimming way too fast! Just because the particular system is specialized with the intent of only doing signatures doesn't mean it's not still encryption. Is that not encryption/decryption of the hash result?

Sure there is. Debt works exactly the same, I loan you 1BTC, you use it for something, and pay it back when you are able. The part that gets weird is *interest*, which is added to account for the fact that $1000 right now is worth more than $1000 later. To compensate, you ask for the difference (or a little more) as interest. Bitcoins woudl turn this on it's head, since 1BTC now is (most of the time) worth *less* than 1BTC later, so you would earn interest on a loan. (If you kept BTC in a savings account, you would probably pay interest on that instead of earning it, but hopefully that interest would be less than the amount of total value gained.)

Single tips work just fine without verify, here, see for yourself:
With RES, you get a little green-check/red-X dot next to the comment header showing if it went through or not, and a stack of coins on the recipient. The verify bot comments are mostly for those without RES at this point, so you can see if that big 0.5B transaction further up in the thread was legit or not.
I think I just confused the bot by trying to do three at once, and it was just like "lolwut, I can only do one thing at a time" and only did the first one of the three.

That's still not safe - it's only in one place. What if a tornado comes through and tosses that fireproof safe a few miles away? I wouldn't want to bet on finding it and the flash drive being intact. What if it floods? Find a second (and maybe third, depending on quantity of coins) place for it. A similar safe at a relative/close friend's house is good, a safe deposit box at a bank would be good. It may even be worth considering keeping a copy of the encrypted file online somewhere.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:36:43
Does that make multiple tips in a single comment work? A normal tip works fine without the verify, it just doesn't add an extra comment with the verification message from the bot, and my understanding of bitcoin-tipping reddiquette is that that many verifies from one person would be considered a little excessive. It appears that without verify it just takes the first valid tip command in the comment and does that, based on what actually ended up happening. Have I misunderstood something?
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:34:39
This is cool, but excessive. The goal is not to make any one copy impossible to lose/destroy. The goal is to make it so that loss/destruction of any one copy is mostly harmless. The simplest and most effective way to do that is to make more copies and store them such that they are seriously unlikely to all be lost/destroyed simultaneously.
Just do what you're already doing, plus an extra copy or two somewhere. How often are you updating this data anyway?
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:08:27
The reddit tip bot allows you to export the private key it uses for you and add it to any wallet of your choice, at which point you and the bot have equal control of that address. Doing this would allow you to sweep those funds out to an address you alone control should you ever start to doubt the bot, or should it vanish for some reason. That's why it uses all public blockchain transactions.
