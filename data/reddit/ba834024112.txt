In what way?
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:32:41
As far as I understand computation is not the bottleneck at all, it's the bandwidth needed to transmit all larger blocks. That's the limiting factor predominantly. 
In order to increase decentralization would you be in favor of reducing the max block size to 750kb?
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:32:35
yes it did. bitcoin is definitely informed by economic theory
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:12:46
Miners have no responsibility to the users
@_date: 2017-03-12 03:02:14
Somehow 1MB is great for decentralization, but 2-4MB is instant centralization and complete failure, without any data showing any concrete relationship between storage, bandwidth, increase adoption, node count... 
It's just this repeated mantra that a one time HF to bigger blocksize to buy time for  2nd later solutions means a total collapse of decentralization. And it gets repeated so often and so ferociously without any real empirical evident in support of this claim. 
If centralization is so completely sensitive to couple MB of Max blocksize, why, in the interest of decentralization, is no one arguing for block size _redeuction_ (besides lukedjr)? This 1MB isn't some happy coincidental sweet spot chosen for optimal network decentralization, it was selected as a temporary value for a parameter that would be increased  as needed and with improvements in storage and bandwidth.

No, the reason we support the name Bitcoin Cash is because of the code base, chain history, and direction laid out in the white paper are sufficiently similar to Bitcoin that inclusion of the name Bitcoin in Bitcoin Cash makes descriptive sense. Bitcoin Cash is distinct from Bitcoin proper, in the same way Ethereum Classic is distinct from Ethereum proper. 
I would happily inform newcomers that they aren't purchasing bitcoin when they purchase Bitcoin cash; they're purchasing Bitcoin Cash. I'm not trying to misrepresent anything. I'm using a descriptive name for BCH that provides useful information on what the coin is and how it's expected to be used.

Sufficient is subjective. Depends on what you think BTC should be. And as far as delaying segwit, it had extreme minority hash support. To say it was delayed or blocked by a single man / handful of men is untrue. 
Segwit _only_ received community support because of the bundled 2x. The idea that segwit alone is sufficient to reduce full blocks, is a minority opinion, although very prominent on this sub.

Meaning the private keys are stored on device, but there's no way to extract them while keeping the seal intact. So you can't for instance write a backup on a piece of paper and still maintain the seal (which must be kept intact if you ever want to trade or gift it to someone).
Essentially if the opendime fails, or burns in a fire,.your funds are lost forever.
If your ledger nano fails, or burns in a fire , you have a seed phrase backup written down on paper. 
Both are good products, but have very different use cases.

Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks, and more recently has become known for its use in bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as part of the mining algorithm. The original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".[1]Later a similar proposal called Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back.[2]

Can you paste your address so we can see it? Transaction fees are determined by size in bytes of transaction, and the size of  a transaction depends on the number of inputs. With a transaction that includes a large number of inputs, you can expect to pay a larger fee, but if you paste your address we can see how reasonable the estimate you were given is
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:21:39
I'm gonna let someone more experienced chime in here but things you can try 
* Send from specific address first with the largest balances to recoup the biggest deposits you've made. Fees on those transactions will be much smaller
* Trying to manually set fee, and sending transactions during a lull when the mempool is much smaller (for instance on the weekends). 
* Using a transaction accelerator like ViaBTCs svice
* If the above fails and you can't find any solutions, you can try auctioning off the private key to your address. Maybe someone will offer something near the 2.5 BTC balance you currently hold in that address.

Predictions yeah. It's all about expectations and risk preference. I get free exposure on both chains. If I'm more risk averse, it certainly makes sense to enjoy exposure in both markets before reducing exposure on, before additional info becomes available. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:21:40
I think it'll  be determined by exchange support and not these otc swaps. I'll definitely be buying 2x with fiat instead of buying 1x with fiat so there's that 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:48:59
Also there is no "you guys" that can be lumped into a single category. I'm just one dude on the internet
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:54:17
It's not about _you_ being able to use bitcoin in your browser, it's about crypto payment support functionality being available by default in _everyones_ browser 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:36:27
I don't care what others do
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:17:18
That is most definitely not the work of a 2 year old 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:48:26
I'm not foolish enough to think I know with certainty which fork will be the dominate chain. If you think you know with certainty, you're deluding yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:28:12
Ignore the maximalists
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:13:25
Time to buy another ledger
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:58:51
Update: definitely decided to swap my 1x for 2x at the time of the fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:34:14
this should be obvious
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:10:53
I never claimed to influence the price. Even if I sold all my BTC, I wouldn't influence the price either. You seem to this notion of all, or most, 2x supporters , and I don't think it accurately reflect the diversity of the community. You keep making these sweeping generalizations and use that to support your claim that 2x will fail 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:38:07
It probably will to an extent, but high volume small orders will be more impactful than a few large swaps 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:36:35
Great news!
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:25:47
That's not true at all
@_date: 2018-04-22 02:24:57
What's wrong with just using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:15:21
you're wildly optimistic / delusional
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:23:07
If everyone follows your advice were back where we started. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:32:40
And your reasons for believing​ this are...?
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:07:57
mostly referring to


@_date: 2017-07-30 03:41:14
I didn't make he claim other coins _are_ immune, so I'm not sure what you're arguing 
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:30:32
good luck with your predictions, i hope they work out for you
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:31:35
You didn't answer the question at all 
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:39:12
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:48:15
And while the maximalists keep spouting this, other coins are gaining developer market share and actually building things 
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:58:48
So what's the take away then? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:44:16
UAHF and UASF are two distinct things 
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:28:41


You are correct. In this case however, it is undeniable this poll will have biased results. I'm not claiming these results are skewed towards a particular position, but you can not deny that willing participants are not representative of the community as a whole. Polling is very difficult, even when steps have been taken to minimize bias. 
1)  I never said  participants were giving luke their login or any other info. By your own assertion


so the poll is obviously biased towards people more willing to  provide access to that information. 
2) 
Although it seems there was confusion as to whether level 0 accounts were/are being counted in the poll. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:23:23
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:16:45
Denying a press pass isn't censorship. No one's ability to  speak is being infringed. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:04:09
Not true at all
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:05:22
But... there will be a fork...
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:41:49
Don't worry, I'll double my shapeshift usage to support their decision 
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:45:38
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:55:13
So you should be happy they're forking off
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:30:32
heres the piece you're missing:
If it costs $1000 to transact, the value wont continue to increase exponentially. Other coins/chains will provide the service of censorship resistant, p2p value transfer, for much less transaction costs
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:57:54
That's not how loans work
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:32:07
2X will succeed because it will have significant majority hashrate. The only reason SW was accepted was because of the bundled 2x.
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:35:48
Oh please
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:22:37
1. You can look at transaction distribution between value-transfer and contract execution, your first point is objectively incorrect. 
2. Ethereum absolutely has first move advantage, if only in the number of developers / private enterprises currently researching and developing for the ethereum network. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:22:33
You're absolutely correct
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:45:39
Perhaps read the response from the pool dev before forming opinions based on false assumptions 
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:56:22
It's subtle but I disagree. It's a temporary change to difficulty retargeting, but the algorithm itself that determines difficulty after that point remains unchanged. 


@_date: 2017-07-21 03:19:23
Can't wait for the 2x!
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:50:27
I would not trust that polling at all 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:46:37
you misunderstood his tweet
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:51:44
Pot, meet kettle
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:26:51
1) the polling is biased towards people willing to sign in with their CB credentials, and won't give a clear representing of communities preferences 
2) It's already been sybilled, as a user documented the successful creation of a new CB and account and subsequent voting 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:14:25
You seem to call anyone who disagrees with you a shill. I'm not sure that word means what you think it means. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:26:19
We're not the ones paying NSF fees buying bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:29:41
Did you even read the comment above yours? He responded to your point exactly
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:42:16
2X will succeed
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:33:51
I never used the word contentious. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:41:38
This doesn't impact customers at all 
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:11:44
Hard forks should not be feared 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:53:15
i dont see any 'crying' at all
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:46:33
The sole purpose for it's creation was larger blocks and no segwit 
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:12:40
Care to wager?
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:24:55
Ignore the maximalists, do your own research on any coin you're interested in. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:05:05
Thank you bitpay
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:32:41
Less available blockspace just makes it cheaper to spam, increasing fees for everyone else
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:37:34
I'd take gavin over you any day
