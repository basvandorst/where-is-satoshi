As a fellow Arizonan that would be amazing.

Litecoin is basically bitcoin only better. Whatever Bitcoin implements Litecoin will do it first. I'm being realistic here.

You can't possibly know with less than one hour of it actually opening. Smart money tends to wait before jumping the gun.

Talk about a pump scam artist, fucking lying on national TV this dude has no shame.

During every crash is seems the assholes come out and try to make other feel like trash because they sold for a loss while the HODLers win again and again.

Thank you finally someone with common sense. I don’t like b cash but this is the truth.

Bought 2 year ether contracts in June I’ve already made my investment with more than 1 year to go.

Poor kid is gonna regret not hodling when he realizes being a doctor is not all it’s cracked up to be. It’s a highly stressful job that literally drains the soul out of you.

Thanks I always revisit this video during every crash

Coinbase getting hacked and losing customer coins is not Coinbase’s fault?

Sympathy plays are no stranger to the stock market.
When one industry does well others within the same industry follow, especially low floats. All "blockchain" companies within the past month have been skyrocketing.

This is the state of crypto sadly.

I’ve made 800% ROI on an 120 mh/s ETH contract since June last year. Stop spreading your misinformation.

Ironic, that’s how I feel when bitcoin maximalists attack bitcoin cash.

You mean to tell me a Bcash was the cause of the crypto crash and not the mere fact the market cap unsustainably increased 25 fold in a very short amount of time?

Long term hold here folks. Put the price app away and know you are investing in something big here.

Lambos are meant to be bought in bitcoin, not rented.

How are you so naive? Companies want profit not potential losses.

The real question is, do I have to pay capital gains tax when  paying my taxes with crypto?

That’s fucking terrible, I wish they would stop selling used ledgers that could potentially be tampered with. They are notorious for reselling, this isn’t a child’s toy some people have significant amount of money to store.
