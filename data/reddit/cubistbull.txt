Ah, that's a shame, it seems like there used to be more camaraderie. But thank you for your answer. It looks like I'll be researching both RasPi and fan upgrades for the next few hours.. It never even occurred to me to try to open it.

Damn did I really underestimate Raspberry Pi, it seems like the best solution. I'll look in to microcontrollers, thank you.

Thank you, I'm sorry. I'll see myself out.

Would you suggest moving the wallet on my laptop over to my mining rig then? Or should I send the majority to a clean wallet on a flash drive or something?

In theory, you wouldn't know the private key, because it's hidden on the bitbill under some sort of tamper-proof seal. If you had broken the seal to copy the private key for your own use, it would be very visually apparent.

I have it on good authority that TrueCrypt doesn't utilize private keys. And by good authority, I mean I mounted a TrueCrypt file on a different  computer and it worked.

What would be the purpose of encrypting it for a physical backup? In case it gets physically stolen?

The whole plausible deniability thing is really only for court proceedings (if they can't prove that you had knowledge of files on your system, they can't be held against you). Sure, I guess it might deter a potential thief if he sees your decoy wallet and stops looking, but at that point, he would have to be in your house, on your computer, holding a gun to your head. How would this "adversary" otherwise *force* you to reveal your password?
I do however very much like the idea of the randomized on-screen keyboard and hope it makes it into the next client update. It might not protect against a bug made specifically to steal bitcoins, but at least it would prevent against simple keyloggers.

Darn, I sent them an email, maybe they'll consider adding support. I'd really like to get one of the games while it's still on sale.
