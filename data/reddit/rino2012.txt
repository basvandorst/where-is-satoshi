He's been out since May: 
"Gavin is right.  The time to increase the block size limit is before transaction processing shows congestion problems. Discuss now,  do soon" - 7:51 AM - 5 May 2015

 "I'm sure there'll be some companies that are like no! We think 1MB blocks are great forever... I know of at least one small company that will say that [smiles]"
Edit: I don't know if I'd consider $21 million in venture funding "small" but anyhow, didn't Blockstream change its position to 2MB now doubling every 2 years until 8MB?
Edit2: He may have been referring to MP, which would make him technically correct.

Could you add a new forum as well? (serious)

The rules are definitely unclear--someone recently had a comment criticizing Blockstream deleted, though that's not written in the rules anywhere. He posted the info in a couple of the other bitcoin subreddits.

I thought anyone could fork the repo, add BIP101, and call it core+bip101?
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:15:16
Could you also show the possible lower bound option for BIP 100 where the max size could halve each time till it approaches nearly zero? (in the case of a 21% attack where 21% of miners vote for zero each time)
Edit: Jeff Garzik recently said there'll be a 1MB floor, so the lowest bound option is now 1MB, so in a 21% attack, the most that 21% of miners can do is keep the max block size at 1MB for each round of voting.

Suppose block size increased to the point that Chinese miners are disadvantaged due to China's relatively low bandwidth. Can this problem be circumvented by placing a pool operator VPS in Hong Kong (or anywhere with good bandwidth) so that found blocks are propagated out from Hong Kong while the mining equipment remains in mainland China (to take advantage of the cheap electricity there)? Or are there other factors to consider?

I think Andreas is right in the long term--Lightning and similar tech should inevitably become the scaling solution of choice as the current protocol ossifies, but that's not the controversy here. This fight is about whether to accommodate increased traffic now or wait in gridlock until off-chain tech matures. Just because a corporate vision wants to delay things with distasteful tactics like censorship and negative PR doesn't mean they're wrong about the future--look at Uber. Either way, bitcoin will be fine in the long run.

but now you know which bank, credit card, and advertisers to boycott and what to tell them when they ask.

probably because those websites' developers can't read Chinese--it'll take some time for them to become aware of these exchanges

Regarding which bank closed bitfloor's account, Roman has confirmed through his twitter handle, defunctzombie, on April 18, that the bank is CapitalOne. My experience with CapitalOne tells me that they are among the most risk averse banks.
