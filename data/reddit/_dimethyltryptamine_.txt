this is not how it works although it is a common misconception. credit creation is not driven by reserves but by demand. you deposit $1000 in a bank and they create whatever amount they want/need to service credit demand. Then they will increase their reserves at the CB.

I know nothing about cars, can you explain why all the hype with Tesla? What makes them so great? If you had the choice between Tesla and Lambo, same price, would you still buy tesla?

congratulaton, you have been successfully educated by the socialist machine.
So if we disagree with theft we have to go live somewhere else? Why don't you keep paying 70% taxes for shitty services and we keep our money and pay for the services we need? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:36:58
Oh yes you are. Try to leave the country if you didn't pay the IRS.

Ask to people from venezuela. Or  cuba. Socialism fails 100% of the times bringing misery and poverty. There are people willing to risk their lives to get away from socialist and communist countries and we are those who should leave? 
Even if 99% of people agree to take someone elses's wealth with cohercition it is still theft. Plus, noone really ever voted to get taxed. The great majority of economically illiterate voters believe the false rethoric of "tax the rich" because they it makes them feel better about their mediocrity. Inevitably they end up worse off.  No goverment is efficient in allocating resources, if you don't see it it is probably because you are a government employee in charge of allocating resources.

ok, have fun on the way to a dystopian world.  government can do what it wants because people think that  government can do what it wants. 
Look at the quality of roads, schools and police and take a peek at the level of debt issued on top of a 50% taxation. Isn't there something wrong there?
Muh road Muh school Muh house burning is the indoctrination that keeps the system going. Bitcoin was made as a mean to resist.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:13:12
Why paying taxes out of sheer fear? If bitcoin has shown something is that govts are not allmighty. Those money will most likely end up paying for foreign wars and other govt. crimes. find a legal way to pay as little taxes as possible or none at all. Keep your hard earned money, had btc failed governments would have spit in our faces. It hasn't so no it wants its pound of flesh. fk it.

Germany, 1934, Reddit: 'Hey, new neighbours just bought the house down the street' ... 'Make sure you report them to the authorities if you think they are Jews! You don't want to be spending 5 years in jail and losing hundreds of thousands of dollars'. 
Consantly repeating the same thing at every post of someone selling increases the illusion that Govt is omnipotent and can do everything. Bitcoin profits are made by taking colossal risks with money that has already been taxed heavily. There should be more resistence wrg the govt theft.

I just wanted to engage in a discussion about the morality of it, and about the necessity to repeat the same mantra to everyone selling. Didn't want to push anyone towards anything. Hopefully your BTC taxes won't end up buying bullets or landmines to be used in some foreign country.

Spot the differences:
Mt. Gox has issued an official statement saying it has found a workaround for its bitcoin [...] problems, which will see bitcoin withdrawals resume "soon". This comes after the team worked over the weekend to begin implementation of a new [transaction] system.
"We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the recent suspension [...]. Fortunately, as we announced on Saturday we have now implemented a solution that should enable withdrawals and mitigate any issues [...]
Thanks to our friends at Blockchain.info, MtGox now has a workaround [...] This will [...] protect the assets of our customers."
At least Karp gave us statements of more than 140 characters.

Now you have to borrow it and sell it. with the cash settled future you will be able to sell bitcoin you did not borrow and redeem them for cash. In theory one could print money and sell the equivalent of 42M bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:10:08
It's all in there people, written black on white. the only reason why their are pulling out the future is to be able to attack and control the price. there is no other method. 
Their excuses are BS: you can already short it, and it is not true that "it only trades up". Once the cash settled future kicks in, Btc can be controlled like silver, gold and other commodities. Ultimately this can lead to legit traders abandoning BTC for other coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:57:40

Âgree on this. That's precisely how market works. we are still looking for max pain
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:17:55
my suggestion would be to buy a trezor or ledger and move the core of your position there. You can always experiment with a buck or two and try other wallets and exchanges. Experimenting while reducing the risk is part of the game to build first hand experience. Listen to all, trust only yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:10:21
There are 384K readers on this sub and 11k here right now.

People will tell you it is impossible because many like to think that what they can't do is not possible. It is. "If it were that easy, everybody would be a millionaire" is like saying that "If you could make millions playing football, everyone would be playing football". 
Trading can be profitable, but it takes an enormous amount of effort preparation and perseverance. Like playing professional football.
I'll give my two cents, in the hope you'll find some usefulness in them. 
Since you mention a strategy, i am assuming you have a system. Let's say it is a trading system you developed. If you haven't one stop everything and put your £1000 and all your energy into developing one. Better it fully automated. Shield your trading from your emotions as much as you can.
Then download price data. Luckily it is much easier to get long price history for cryptos than for other financial instruments. Backtest extensively your system of multiple time frames. Ideally your system should use information from multiple Tfs.
Put all your efforts in the backtesting and make sure you aren't integrating any future information in the rules. That sounds obvious but you'll see it might be tricky. When you have backtested it for a long time and got the hand on how the system behaves on different market condition start working on the software to link it to an exchange. That has to be rock solid. You will be tempted to trade your system and discover that it is a very difficult thing to do because of emotions and double thinking.
Focus on making a rock solid code that sends the order to an exchange based on your backtested system.
Run everything for weeks without really sending orders, make sure there are no race conditions and fix as many bugs as you can. When comfortable with it, put your £1000 and watch the system work. start small. trade small until you get to know your system as your hand. If the real trading results are not inline with the statistics of your backtest stop everything and understand why. 
It can be done mate. Good luck

Government employee spotted here!
And no, I don't believe in any tax rate higher than 0%. Although i could live with a flat 2% tax to fund helpful services like disaster recovery. Every thinking person should start reflecting about how taxation works and he will come to the inevitable conclusion. Governments dismissed bitcoin for a long time but now that more people start believing it has value, government wants to steal it. Taxation will eventually be pushed onto bitcoin. Hopefully the system is good enough to allow many to resist to the abuse.
