Exchanges' revenue is not based on transaction fees at all. The reason the adoption of SegWit is so slow is because if you are an exchange or wallet provider, the cost and effort of implementing SegWit in your backends far outweighs the cost and effort of pushing the higher network fees onto customers while blaming the developers for not providing the scaling solution that is already available to them.

Your &lt;35% is based on market cap though, isn't it? I was calling you out on that. I don't think there is really a viable alternative for Bitcoin in the currency/store of value department. RootStock will give Bitcoin smart contract viability too. I think the future is bright.

Node operators (including miners) are free to use any version of any software they wish. Most versions are compatible with eachother. If they are not compatible, but the node operator chooses to run incompatible software anyway, a fork occurs. Forks can also be planned; if a change is to be made that would be significant enough not to be backwards compatible a flag-day fork can occur, where every participant in the network applies the new rules at once.

When using a third party custodial accounts, you don't actually own any address. The exchange will send from inputs that correspond to other people's deposits.

I used to agree with your view, but consider this:
* A second "hop" is inevitable, it's better to get it over and done with now.
* It leaves a familiar two digits after after the decimal point (at least until sub-satoshi transactions)
* Indicates to public the divisibility of bitcoin and does away with the dreaded "can you buy less than a bitcoin?"
* The bigger the "hop" now the clearer it becomes that bitcoin is a deflationary asset.

You've moved the goalposts. Your initial beef with the lightning network was centralization, which isn't an issue. Now you've got beef with lightning network because it will alleviate the congestion problem?? Linear on-chain scaling will not work. Ethereum's blockchain is growing at alarming rates. Every other garbagecoin (including bcash) would suffer from the same issues, and their only solution seems to be either more centralization, or robbing bitcoin's innovation.
You mentioned in your initial post that the only advantage you see to Bitcoin is first-mover's advantage. You fail to see the Mariana Trench-sized crater between Bitcoin and other altcoins in terms of acceptance, the vibrant development ecosystem, innovation and reliability.

Bitcoin is treated as 'private money'. When bitcoin is exchanged for sterling or for foreign currencies, such as euro or dollar, no VAT will be due on the value of the bitcoins themselves. However, in all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency. Profits and losses on cryptocurrencies are subject to capital gains tax.

It will always continue to some extent. Whether it'll have and value in terms of fiat is another question altogether.


 BTU would never be a token. That would be the actual ticker for the actual coin. Assuming you meant "BCC can become BTU", that is wrong as well.
There are two possible outcomes.
**In the event of a BU hardfork:** BCC -&gt; BTC and BCU -&gt; BTU.
**In the even of no hardfork:** BCC -&gt; BTC and BCU is worthless and destroyed.
At no point can BCC become BTU.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:58:44
"If there is no discernable and incompatible Bitcoin Unlimited blockchain emerges before midnight of December 31, 2017, then BCU will expire worthless and BTC will be given in exchange for each BCC holder. If, however, there is a discernable and incompatible Bitcoin Unlimited blockchain (which we will list under the ticker symbol BTU), then, as soon as we list BTU, we will exchange BCU tokens for BTU as well as retiring BCC tokens in favor of BTC."

Always buy, Never sell. HODL
Legit Answer: The market is trying to agree with itself about the real current value of a coin. I cannot simply continue going up forever. You cannot get worked up about minuscule changes hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute, but instead look at the bigger trends. I still think we can get to $1000 before [the halvening]( but that is my personal view and shouldn't be used by you as a direction of what to do. I would hold your coins, as in my view, in a few years the prices will be in the thousands.

Yeah, bitcoin only works when there are miners.

There is no point at which you can profitably mine bitcoin on servers.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:40:41
After a bitcoin transaction has been included in a block someone would have to attack the whole network to try and remove it. It becomes exponentially more difficult with each subsequent block that is mined on top of the block that the transaction is included in. A transaction with 2-6 confirmations is often considered irreversible (this varies with who you ask).
All you need to accept bitcoin payments is a public address for them to send it to. [bitcoin.org]( has a fairly beginner-friendly comparison of some of the wallets that you can use to generate these addresses.
Because of the pseudo-anonymous and decentralized nature of bitcoin, it is rather easy to spend stolen funds. As a merchant this may or may not matter to you, and depending on which it is you may want to implement some sort of identity verification to your payment system.

There are currently no issues or pull requests open on bitcoin/bitcoin regarding UASF. You would have to ask one of the core devs if they plan on merging it into the next version on core.
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:23:26
1. UASF requires ~50% of hashpower, and a substantial majority of nodes to be "safe".
2. What's the question?
3. If the economic majority are running UASF enabled nodes, any miner that decided not to produce a segwit signalling block will be rejected. Only blocks that signal segwit, and are children of segwit signalling blocks will be accepted by the rule validators (nodes).
4. I believe the current date for UASF on litecoin is June 1st. The date for UASF on bitcoin is August 1st.
5. If UASF happens, segwit will be locked in after 95% of blocks in an activation period (2016 blocks) are segwit signalling. I think it's 75% on litecoin. However it is worth noting that UASF nodes will only allow segwit signalling blocks so 100% of blocks in the final activation period will be segwit signalling.
6. What you are describing is a "51% attack", on which there are already a load of resources.

From what I understand there is likely going to be another, different, "anti-asicboost" softfork.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:29:32
The most likely failure of UASF is if "the economic majority" doesn't support it. BIP148 only works if the majority of nodes (users) agree to reject invalid blocks based on the new ruleset. This can be alleviated by either **getting enough support** or if by August 1st there isn't enough support, nodes can remove the UASF code to prevent forking themselves off in which case the status quo remains. If a significant of users miners do remain on the UASF chain, but they don't have a majority of support, they will end up on a minority chain that is likely to quickly die off.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:10:19
We don't need everyone to actually run UASF. Only major economic players' support, and &gt;50% of hashpower would be enough to reorg the  the currentcoin chain into the uasfcoin chain.

There is no single data source that could provide such a binary answer. It will be clear from the number of people running the UASF code, supporting through uacomment, statements from businesses and individuals and general discussion whether or not people even want UASF to happen.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:13:12
I think uacomments are, for now, the best way to signal support without having to run the code. But you have to remember that this **will not enforce UASF on August 1st!**

No very complicated. There is a [great post]( by that explains it line by line (The code has changed a little bit since then but the basic concepts are still there.) The risks of UASF are fairly well understood and are unlikely to be anything to do with buggy code; no binaries will ever be available until an extremely thorough review.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:02:55
I see. The code was refactored a few days ago, but from what I understand the code is in a *final-ish* version. We are still waiting for even more reviews from trusted members of the community which may or may not bring about more changes. I also think that there is mostly an understanding that binaries will be released when even more discussion, review and signalling of support occurs. The main worry with releasing binaries is that it allows non-tech-savvy users to run code without understanding the importance of keeping updated if a patch was to happen. Everyone wants to avoid having multiple versions of binaries floating around.

This is good advice. *Legit* binaries will be signed by as many trusted members of the community as possible.

If all you want to do is signal your support for UASF then changing your uacomment, without having to download or run any addition software, is sufficient.
Otherwise, if you want to run a UASF enforcing node, then you must download the source and compile it yourself; we are not releasing binaries yet.

I am not sure how to answer your first two questions... I guess it could be said that an economy exists and the majority of it is the economic majority.

There is always a reward (currently that is 12.5, (it was 50 in the beginning and halves ~every 4 years)) for mining a block, and on top of that miners also get transaction fees. That is why miners like AntPool that regularly mine empty blocks (with no transactions) can afford to do so.

From what I understand it was changed to August 1st to account for up to ~85% of miners not following the UASF chain. Only ~15% of hashpower needs to follow BIP148 for it to succeed.

Yes. This is called a "chain reorganization" or "reorg" and it results in all transactions on one chain, since the chain split, to be wiped. This can only happen during a softfork and it can usually happen to only one of the two chains.

This is a great questions. If you have about 40 minutes to spare, I would strongly recommend watching this [discussion with Trace Mayer]( that goes into a lot of depth about why it would be extremely dangerous for companies to not support the BIP148 chain during a potential chain split.
When he says *"They must support both chains, period"*, he is absolutely correct. Because of the reorganization risk that is present only on the legacy chain, any service that does not support BIP148 risk having **all coins and transaction post-August 1st wiped** should BIP148 become the longest chain (this may happen in a few minutes or hours but also months). Would you want to be in a position where a few months of economic activity is wiped because you didn't support the chain that does not suffer from reorg risk?
My advice would be to **not use services that do not support BIP148**; regardless if you are behind BIP148 or not. That said the safest thing to do is always to hold your own keys, and perform your own validation, instead of outsourcing it to a third-party.

BIP148 will never need to be used if SegWit is locked in or active before August 1st. The best way to avoid BIP148 being used, if that is important to you, is to do everything you can to get miners to signal for SegWit using bit 1 of the current BIP9 deployment.

When people say "resolved fork" they mean that either the legacy chain reorganised into the new chain, or the new chain becomes stale and abandoned. If you do not transact between the start if the fork and when it is resolved you will end up with one set of coins (the same amount you had) on the chain that "won".

Just a sidenote that the "backing of country governments" doesn't give a bit of paper (and certainly not entries on private company databases) any value at all.
With bitcoin, it is the combination of intrinsic rarity as well as a process called "Proof of work" that gives it its value. Read more about PoW [here]( but it is essentially what mining (traditional ores) is. The only reason we recognize gold as having value is because there is a finite supply, and it is hard to extract.

BIP148 does not cause a hardfork. It is a method of activating SegWit via bit1 signalling by orphaning blocks that don't signal for SegWit beginning August 1st. **If there is a chain split**, the difference between bip148chain and legacychain will be that bip148chain will have SegWit and legacychain won't. Legacychain is also prone to a violent reorganisation risk that could wipe out days/months/years of economic activity.

@_date: 2017-06-14 06:11:56
You've had the wool pulled over your eyes. Barry's agreement doesn't commit to activating SegWit. Don't get hoodwinked!

It really is that simple. Do you expect every node to always have to care abut your coffee forever? Probably not. On-chain scaling will never give us the desired throughput (Visa/PayPal level) without having multi-terabyte blocks every second.

Yes, it's a hardfork.

Do you get your covfefe instantly, or do you have to wait until AntPool decides to mine a block with transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:58:08
I don't think &lt;$100 transactions belong on-chain.

Yes, on the contrary to August, the pricing strategy for September has been released.

If you can expect to make gains that exceed trading fees then there is no reason why you shouldn't.

Let me try to explain, and if I don't do a good job, feel free to ask further.
Ownership of bitcoin is defined as having access to the private keys associated with available outputs. To simplify, you can only say you own bitcoin if you have a secret key, that no one else knows, that allows you to create, sign and broadcast new transactions to the network. This is done by software called a "bitcoin wallet". There are many varieties of wallets exist, and a lot of the good ones are listed [here](
On Coinbase, you can think of your coins as being in a big pool, where there is a certain number of coins assigned to your coinbase account. This is seperate from the bitcoin blockchain and is much like a bank. This is a *third-party custodial account* because a third-party hold your bitcoin for you. This pretty much goes against the principle of bitcoin which is that you are your own bank.

No, pretty much all of them [do not agree]( that it is a terrible idea.

Many people aren't against bigger blocks per se, but want SegWit and off-chain solutions first. Also, the community is mostly rejecting Bitcoin Unlimited, which is a broken, centralized and profit-oriented gamble by a handful of miners &amp; Ver.

1. Currently: *miner reward = new coins (12.5BTC/block at present) + transaction fees*. When there are no new coins generated per block: *miner reward = transaction fees*.
2. No, there is a 12.5BTC/block reward regardless of transaction fees.
3. The pool gets the miner reward and distributes it to participants according to a per-determined and agreed system.
4. Yes, but it's excruciatingly improbable.

I never said anything about not processing transactions &lt;$100.

It would be tremendously effective! The average user is not going to touch anything behind a horrifying red button that says **danger danger advanced options danger danger**

I am on holiday! Which is why I got so stressed, because I don't have access to all my fiat to buy a shittonne of BTC if needed.

Liquidity. No P2P exchange has overcome the chicken ⇌ egg situation.

To hoodwink you.

I assume by "in my profile" you mean a balance in a third-party custodial account.
*Is it common practice for third-party service providers to move your funds after a deposit?* Yes. Once you send your coins to an address that is controlled by a third-party they will often move them around as they please. If the service is legitimate, upon withdrawal from your third-party custodial account, they will send coins to an address that you control.
If you are using a service like coinbase, where it is possible to send coins to other users of that service, the "transaction" is strictly off-chain as it consists of adding and subtracting from balances **on the third-party's database**. Only upon withdrawal do any transactions happen on-chain.

Gold doesn't get a lot of its value from industrial uses, I don't think. I am not an expert of precious metals, but would copper and silver be a lot more valuable?
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:16:38
Funny how it says *digital* on a physical coin.
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:42:51
[Docs]( say no seed = no coins. Be more careful next time.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:21:25
Found [this]( Are you running out of memory?

You are either memeing or are incredibly dim... The point of this post is that I was not allowed to use a transaction fee of my choosing.

When I say "much like a bank", the only difference I can really think of is regulation. We all know that people getting Goxxed again at some point is more likely than them getting Barclaysed.

$1 transactions do not belong on the blockchain. I'd recommend donating via some other method.
