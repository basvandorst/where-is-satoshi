Another perspective: the currency won't be blamed for the robbery as Bitcoin would be. 
One more: people are never killed in Bitcoin robberies. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:36:50
Bring 50. They can't have that many guards.

Apple Pay is no way a competitor of Bitcoin anymore than Paypal competes with the dollar. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 14:05:15
Where's yours?
@_date: 2016-08-27 14:30:46
I think the risk of forgetting passwords or deleting wallets accidentally is much more likely. 
I doubt all this is holding Bitcoin back anyway. Serious investors would have proper set ups and novices with small amounts can use online wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:59:08
Bitcoins not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 13:58:00
You're not very patient. The last halving didn't have any affect for a couple of months.
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:38:57
Oh dear. You're judging by a change in price? There are some shitcoins that go up 1000% in a day but they will never achieve Bitcoin's level of domination. And if ETC is up that's worse anyway. Looks like it's not going away. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:33:39
@_date: 2016-08-28 13:59:23
Its volatility is overstated. It only appears volatile during bubbles or mini-bubbles. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:25:46
That's not what he's worried about, I think. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 13:56:13
The price is as high as it needs to be. What's this problem you talk about?
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:36:07
Can you prove it's about uncertainty over this event?
@_date: 2016-08-28 14:04:06
Few will have held that long. Anyway, you could say the same of people in 2011 who bought at $30 then saw it drop to $2. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 14:27:04

Why do so many misspell this?
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:16:44
It wasn't Bitcoin's fault per se. It shouldn't really be affected.

Impractical and wasteful perhaps but nice collectors' items.
@_date: 2016-04-03 23:25:30
Nothing right away but rise from $13 to $266 started shortly after.
@_date: 2016-04-23 21:33:38
It shows owning Bitcoin is desirable. Nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:26:42
As a collector's piece yes. This is not practical though. I said that elsewhere.

@_date: 2016-04-03 21:48:50
Are you suggesting there's no innovation on the Bitcoin world? Wrong if so. MAST being the latest. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 01:50:36
It took a few months after the last halving so let's see. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 13:19:27
Wrong guess.

Why do you need to convince them of anything? Just get some. There's no age limit for entry. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:42:41
Surely the point is Bitcoin is unstoppable. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:02:42
You can say that again. Oh. You have. 
@_date: 2016-04-30 01:15:25
Wrong sub, surely.
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:53:57
That's not what I meant. Bitcoin can be marked as coming from disreputable sources, e.g. Silk Road. Gold cannot as it can be melted and recast. Bitcoin needs better privacy/mixing.
@_date: 2016-04-03 00:47:32


Why would he? Assuming he can.
@_date: 2016-04-15 13:05:07
But loose has an S sound. Lose a Z sound.
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:42:32
Bitcoin is all that matters. Not the personalities.
@_date: 2016-04-17 14:51:53
50/50 just means it will happen or it won't. It's binary. It could  be just 1% chance that it will and 99% chance that it won't but it's still 50/50.
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:24:37
Or with a debit card.
@_date: 2016-04-18 20:19:33
Yes there is - to use Core.
@_date: 2016-04-21 16:08:39
He didn't say that.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:23:40
It's nothing to do with Bitcoin. All the restrictions are on the fiat side. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 00:24:12
@_date: 2016-04-04 05:17:40
Why would they buy at that price when they can get it for less?
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:37:06
What is your point? 
@_date: 2016-04-05 02:19:21
So he's worried about money? Which is what Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:35:20
If demand is desperate people will find a way. Localbitcoins or something similar.
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:56:49
Satoshi-like. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:23:33
Why should they use Bitcoin unless they already have some? How is it better for buying food at your tent than cash or a credit card? Do you accept gold?
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:29:53
Most of them are. Or at least money-making exercises. The developers would be better off putting their efforts into making Bitcoin better (and maybe the other 2 or 3 top coins) or the infrastructure around it. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:49:39
Heat can turn the whole paper black. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 02:18:18

@_date: 2016-04-17 00:37:53
50/50 doesn't mean 50% chance.
@_date: 2016-04-07 04:11:19
He bought them in 2009 but yes, this is an old story. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 14:29:16
Considering it required 10,000 bitcoins, next to worthless. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 14:19:40
Not me.
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:13:22
If it's remittances we are talking about then it doesn't really matter what the BTC price is, $40 or $400.

Complacency? Have you checked out how smug the "smart contract" bunch are on their sub?
@_date: 2016-04-04 23:44:14
"gold bullion"
@_date: 2016-04-20 11:45:42
I meant worthless.
@_date: 2016-04-15 09:15:18
Did they or do you use a service that relies on user names to send Bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-04-21 00:26:48
The bitcoins would have been worth about 0.002 each if so. That's worthless.
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:12:56
Satoshi is not a prophet.
@_date: 2016-04-19 20:25:08

@_date: 2016-04-11 14:40:06
Only if you're dyslexic. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 00:25:07

@_date: 2018-01-08 01:37:59

@_date: 2016-04-14 14:00:16
And don't exaggerate. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:58:48
Betteridge would say no, unfortunately.
@_date: 2016-04-18 00:59:55
Well, yeah, because people want free stuff. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 16:14:06
Because it looks ungracious. They weren't going to keep his money anyway - if had done something wrong the feds or whoever would've seized it.
@_date: 2016-04-05 05:11:16
Volume as I write far higher than a certain upstart coin. What are you on about?
@_date: 2016-04-08 21:12:07
IP and crypto adresses presumably he means.
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:20:31
Don't confuse divisibility with quantity. It may be more divisible than gold or silver but those satoshis are going to be worth even less.
Bitcoin can be both gold and silver anyway. There's no need for Litecoin.

@_date: 2018-01-24 16:03:39
I wasn't confusing the two.
Market share is pretty meaningless though.
Bitcoin reached almost 20,000 whilst almost everything else was not moving. Down was the only way it could go. Other major coins are down also. There are far more alts now.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:44:35
Does Bitcoin need that? Anyway, it looks like you just enquire first. After that I don't know.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:13:43
Anecdotal. And you don't even say how much you were sending.

@_date: 2018-01-10 14:24:40
Volatility was cited as the reason.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:36:54
I know that, but if you're sending 76,000 dollars or more, $25 might seem worth it. That first chart makes it look like everyone is paying $25 fees.
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:45:44

Now get lost, troll. This is over.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:17:06
8 years ago no one was aware of cryptos beyond a few nerds. Bitcoin was the only crypto and its market cap was smaller in total I'd imagine than all the TheDAO funds. Bitcoin was not in the news then the way ETH was last year.
There are far more users of BCH than ETC because there are far more users of Bitcoin and because the Ethereum community wrongly or rightly has agreed that ETH is the true Ethereum.
The only thing absurd is ETH's claim to censorship-resistance.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:28:08
Maybe that's what the whales want you to think.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:37:23
Could be right. I do think the last halving started all this. Not ETFs or anything else.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:12:17
Start using
They even list btrash as bcash.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:29:46
Supposedly. Anyway, the markets don't always care about this.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:50:51
No. You sure you answered the right person previously?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:19:46
Points out that .org is a more valid URL though. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 23:26:44
In an even more experimental coin that's not even intended as a store value? No thanks.
@_date: 2016-04-13 00:48:26
It wouldn't be exciting anyway.
@_date: 2016-04-05 01:46:45
The price went up 9000% in 2013. More than a mere doubling. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:52:44
Yes it does. It is also volatile.

This comment is:

@_date: 2018-01-04 15:47:20
That's not what he asked.
@_date: 2016-04-17 00:04:26
Obviously he was flagged (wrongly) for doing something wrong. He got his money back.
@_date: 2016-04-04 22:24:07


Easy to remember. Is it not possible to search for normal names?
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:40:05
Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:43:04
Aw, we're criticizing the poor guys. Give me a break. Fuck the other side.
@_date: 2016-04-17 19:00:26
Maybe because I would. I don't think Kraken are out to get him. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:00:13
The value comes from being useful. Unseizable, borderless money. Short it if you're so sure. Wall Street is on board. A few vendors which nobody ever pays with Bitcoin anyway are of no concern.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:09:32
Oh yeah. Fuck Micro$oft.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:06:04
By Bitcoin core I mean the Bitcoin (core) developers. Don't be pedantic.


Apart from the URL. Don't dismiss the importance of URLs.  has nothing to do with Nissan but they are fighting for it.
@_date: 2016-04-24 11:42:36

@_date: 2016-04-20 11:20:40
It was worth pennies then, though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:36:06


Straw man. No I wasn't. Show me where I mentioned it. I said "Bitcoin Core" talking about the developers and the 9 year old software and you seemed to think I was talking about Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.


Maybe this is the reason for your misunderstanding.
The Nissan comment is not irrelevant. Certainly far less than your bewildering diversion into fork territory. 
Nissan are not happy with that URL being used by someone else just as Satoshi wasn't with Bitcoin.com being in someone else's (anyone else's) hands (other than the Bitcoin DEVELOPERS (I trust that will prevent you from being confused)).

8 years ago. And a catastrophic bug. No comparison. Not even sure consensus could be reached now to undo this type of thing considering things like big blocks and S2x can't even be agreed on.
Not hating on ETH but let's not pretend it's more censorship resistant than Bitcoin.

Oh dear. They’re not.

@_date: 2018-01-30 05:01:48
Because they try to pass themselves off as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:56:38
And ETH stayed at $300 while Bitcoin raced to $7000+
I meant daily anyway. Not long term.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:34:51
yeah. All cryptos are volatile.
@_date: 2016-04-04 05:19:12
On Localbitcoins it could be double that. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:08:07
There are restrictions but they are not censorship. And there are other options. If a movie is censored the makers cannot take the movie to another censor board. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:12:36
The fact that a crypto currency which has not been updated for two years has a $725M market cap only highlights the current madness.
Whether it's working or not it has little future.

Regardless, it's not what the OP was asking.
@_date: 2016-04-14 13:57:11
Doesn't sound like censorship to me. Censorship is removing parts of a book, film etc. that are considered objectionable.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:13:53
Actively? I doubt it.

Far more than any other coin. And miners don't control a much as you think as we saw with S2X.

Thanks. Came to check if this was so.

You're being sarcastic I trust? It's always being rammed down our throats.
Anyway he shouldn't have made the supply fixed and diminishing if he wanted it to cash. Terrible idea. As a gold however...
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:04:55

@_date: 2018-01-31 20:08:47
And Bitcoin is the most decentralized chain so I don't know what the hell you're on about.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:12:10
But Bitcoin was the first blockchain. Alts are the testing ground for Bitcoin. It will incorporate these features if they are any good.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:14:52
I’ve no idea what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:31:57
There are a lot of articles claiming coins are special. They need to prove themselves over 9 years.
You sound like you are shilling frankly.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:48:18


You're not sure?

@_date: 2018-01-09 12:18:51
Trustworthy? Their site was down multiple times recently.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:03:48
Crypto is money. There's no shame in wanting to make money. And pyramid schemes are centralized. You're trolling now.
This quote says it all:
"Bitcoin is a tool for freeing humanity from oligarchs and tyrants, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme."
None of these cryptos would get off the ground if there was no incentive to make money. To say otherwise is being disingenuous.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:24:26
BTC is Bitcoin. The other one is a Chinese knock off.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:23:48

@_date: 2016-04-17 14:47:31
Obviously he did nothing wrong or he wouldn't be getting his money back so he can say thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:03:25
Not sure how you read that into it.
And your earlier argument about places not accepting gold (or BTC) is not a valid one. Amazon and many many others do not accept cash. Does that mean cash is not a currency or a money?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:51:36


Steam made a statement so why not.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:46:14
You are confusing money with currency.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:09:55
I disagree. It’s not just pedantic. Gold even now is a money.

It's all speculative, pal. I don't need to read up to see you're cherry-picking facts to fit your agenda.

"A Microsoft support staffer has told us"?

Indifferent.

Examples please?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:50:10
It was they who had pumped it to 1200 in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:27:38
I didn’t say it’s a problem but it’s far overplayed and exaggerated. Misleading stats are shown and Segwit and lightning are dismissed. 
Bitcoin is not Paypal anyway. It’s a censorship resistant, deflationary store of value. That’s its USP. Not payments. Not yet anyway. 
As for “big named dropping it”. If Bitcoin were a mere centralised e-cash this might be a problem. Those fretting over stuff like Steam or MS are naive. Give me Wall Street and hedge funds any day. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:57:23

It would still be volatile.

Hugeness confirmed.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:17:20


Are you new here? Who's talking about the fork? Bitcoin Core is and has been for a long time the name of the software. For a history expert how can you not know this? You think the term "Bitcoin Core" was invented after the fork?
You ignore my Nissan comment and brought up this irrelevancy.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:49:29
Why the last 3 months? Because it fits your agenda?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:54:04
Bitcoin is updated you know. It's not using 2009 tech only.
A lot of these claims of superior tech from alts is spurious.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:19:53
It's a good money though. Yes, there is a difference.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:57:46
Many here are claiming fees are responsible. It says nothing about fees. Volatility is a problem and every alt including BCH suffer from it. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:20:41
He bought at 9700.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:02:41
Being developed for free and 10-20x rises in price not enough to appease them. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:04:09
But he made it finite and "mineable" like gold.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:00:37
Yeah, that's not volatile.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:40:26


That's some claim. Convince me.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:27:41
It still wouldn't be.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:35:23
You missed the volatile bit.

Know what's nicer? Providing a source for this $30 figure.
BTC's gone 15x versus the dollar last year, so the latter hasn't much to boast about.

When MS adopted it the price didn’t go up. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:09:08
It is a money. And a very good money. I agree it's not a great currency. Few if any of the alts are.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:02:49


They've had 5 years at least. I think there are a few.


@_date: 2018-01-22 16:32:33
You didn't say 3000, you said lower. And in percentage terms no, the 2013-4 drop was lower. And it went to 160 not 250.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:17:12
It was a rhetorical question.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:21:14
You need to check your wallet settings.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:11:29
ETH was rolled back. The Dao smart contract should have been honored. ETH not only proved it is not censorship resistant but also that their smart contracts are pointless.
And please spare me the old spurious comparison with the Value overflow incident. The two cases are philosophically completely different.
With the DAO a smart contract was buggy and someone got access to the funds - funds owned by the like of Buterin. They should have accepted the loss and moved on.
184 billion bitcoins were accidentally created. There were always only intended to be 21 million bitcoins. This was early in Bitcoin's history and had to be fixed.
Tell me. Where was the roll back after Mt Gox? Nobody dreamt of doing such a thing.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:07:20
I said 10x to put things into perspective. Bitcoin is above $10,000 and people are worried about other alts butting in?
And don't blame me if you are ambiguous. Dominance is the term commonly used if not being specific. State market share versus ETH, BCH or all alts.
And spare me the smartarse tone if you can't argue in a civilised way. No I couldn't give a shit about Stripe. If you understood Bitcoin you'd know it was much bigger.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:19:55
Ah, ok. Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:58:21
Interesting juxtaposition with the truck.
Didn't Charlie Munger once say Bitcoin is rat poison?
...and the bankers are the rats.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:30:53
There's a consensus that Bitcoin is the most valued one. Being the first mover, market leader. Simply cloning it does not make another Bitcoin. The clone does not have the developers, the community, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:02:07
It's a price we pay for the best security and decentralization at the cost (currently) of scalability. All alts will have scaling problems.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:35:01
Think again.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:53:22
No. They’re all volatile.

That would be fine if the other side wasn't spouting propaganda on CNBC and bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:31:38


TheDAO roll back put a stop to that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:19:43


But less secure. And other coins will have scaling problems.


You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin.


Don't be a drama queen.


You seem to think Bitcoin is a mere Paypal. These sites don't accept gold either.


Are you serious? 2X would have been an unmitigated disaster. Had only one developer and they had a serious bug when they eventually tried to fork.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:55:58
Segwit and 15x rise is 0 progress?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:56:27


And what would initiate such a thing? It had been in a bear market for two years. It had been hanging around $200 for ages after hitting $1200. It did not look like a get rich scheme mid-2015 to mid-2016.
Only a sudden decrease in supply would initiate a new bull market.
And anyway - there's nothing wrong if people think it will make them rich. It fosters adoption. No one is buying Bitcoin or any crypto to buy stuff on the web.


New tech like lightning, MimbleWimble make these arguments redundant. And Bitcoin is still the most decentralized and secure Blockchain - which is most important.
Stuff like Raiblocks and certainly bcash fall well short of Visa anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:24:00
Most coins will not go to zero.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:17:10
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:47:37
Lightning and Segwit makes this a non-issue. Fees have been exaggerated anyway. $25 and the like cited but no mention it's often for people sending tens of thousands of dollars worth.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:26:02
Monetary doesn't necessarily mean currency.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:51:21
And again why the last 3 months? Like I said because it fits your agenda/bias. Presumably that Bitcoin only is in a bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:03:43
Why is it childish? It's not Bitcoin. But its users are claiming it is.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:47:17
Of course it's an attack. Ver is on CNBC every chance he can to rubbish Bitcoin.

But not as secure or decentralised. That’s the point. So why use Litecoin? 
Oh and “lol”? You’re easily amused. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:59:02
No one was using Stripe with Bitcoin. No scape-goating. All coins are volatile anyway.

Doge knew its place.


I meant the counterfeits. Ones called iFone and the like.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:14:33
You might want to check the formatting.


ETH, for example, already has had scaling issues. Network clogged by ICO launches and Cryptokitties.


Exchange fees? Isn't that normal. And shouldn't you compare with forex not stocks? Your Bitcoin returns are more likely to be far greater anyway.
Bitcoin is a money just as gold is. It's not a very good currency. Not yet anyway. Currencies should not have a finite supply. Not sure what Satoshi was thinking there.


@_date: 2018-01-08 02:05:34


Strong argumentative skills. Congrats, kiddo.
You forget people don't buy Bitcoin just for the rises. They are using it to store their money. Where it safe from thieving governments. And I don't just mean tax.
It's not a bubble. It's a transfer of wealth.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:17:43
Another fee-obssesive. Use Segwit, Einstein. Fees in any case noting to do with the topic. Will the USD give you 15X returns in a year? No. They because the supply is not fixed.

The part that secures your money safe from censorship and seizure - more than any other coin at present. And any fiat currency or gold for that matter.

@_date: 2018-01-08 15:01:45
It all depends on how much you send. ATMs can charge that much for small amounts when you are abroad. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:10:43
I have some also, but predominantly BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:50:30
That much? And without a chance of being halted? And to anywhere?
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:17:39


Sure, there are coins that have gone up more. I mean when Bitcoin takes big dip they usually all do. Everything is red.
I am diversified anyway. Mostly in BTC though.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:36:33
Bah. When Bitcoin falls they all do. The only advantage is some of the cheaper coins have more of a chance of 10-50 x-ing.

Vendor acceptance does not define if something is a money. Or even a currency.
Stores don't accept currencies from other countries but they do accept vouchers. Vouchers are money?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:41:31
It only has to be accepted by other users to give it value. You give vendors far too much importance.
You didn't answer why the Euro is not invalidated as a currency.
I don't see how your next paragraph is relevant to what we were talking about. Bigger blocks do not stop BCH from being volatile. Plus it makes it less secure and decentralized. Segwit gave Bitcoin a safer block size increase. It might be good if more used it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:43:13
And too volatile - like btrash. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:04:48
It’s completely inconsequential news. If Bitcoin depends on a few vendors then it’s no better than PayPal. Those fretting over this don’t understand what Bitcoin really offers.

It generally does dip when Bitcoin does however.

But Btrash is Satoshi's vision!
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:19:41

Even Peter Brandt recently conceded holding was probably better.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:59:52


Just like ETH. There's no great demand for smart contracts.
There are plenty of new Bitcoin technologies. Segwit, Lightning, MAST, schnorr signatures, atomic swaps, etc etc. A sheer myth that Bitcoin is standing still.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:21:18
Yeah. let's give up, curl up and die. Or wait for lightning.

That’s not an answer. I know these currencies are not accepted in the US. That’s obvious. Point is just because they are not accepted does not invalidate them as currencies.

I didn't know he was with PayPal. Longtime BTC fan. Got sidetracked by that 2X nonsense though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:18:10
And parasitic alts. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:02:26
Market cap is a possibility. Mainstream adoption? Don't make me laugh. There's no wide spread demand for smart contracts - which are probably not even workable anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:25:30
XRP is owned by a company though.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:20:32
Bitcoin has smart contracts. Simpler ones but they are there. And more sophisticated ones can be added with second layers.


No, it's not. It gives the impression (wrongly) to some that Bitcoin is not scarce and can just be copied. How many different golds do we need?
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:23:59
The problem with that is your money is not your own during that period unless you keep it in cash.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:39:12
What on Earth are you talking about? There are many coins have jumped much percentage wise than Bitcoin last year.
Thanks but it's not my birthday.

Yes. But the higher the better anyway. It’s all relative.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:47:26
Fine. But don’t make it a fee only thing to push your agenda. Volatility is a problem. And all coins suffer from it. 
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:40:45
Ltcbtc down from January 2018
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:49:29


Rather a misleading stat since the Avg. Transaction Value appears to be over $100,000.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:31:54
If Bitcoin's success depends on some vendors, yes it is. Luckily Bitcoin has a lot more to offer.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:04:09

Because now it is been used, for nefarious purposes. The .com is being touted by some as making it more official. .org is preferred by tech projects.

Don’t blame Bitcoin. Blame scammers.
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:21:43

But you can't toss it like a coin or roll it up to snort coke.
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:33:27
They started from single figures though most of them. And Bitcoin had a run in 2017 while the alts stood still.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:44:25
They didn’t specify that as a reason.

I don’t give a shit about crypto. Only Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:16:52

Bitcoin is a reasonable store of value at least.

Ah give it a rest.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:42:53
What's in it for the vendor? And I read once when you gave a customer too many payment options they can put off buying at all.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:27:41
Compared to what?
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:18:31
It might be abused.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:31:17
If you sell Bitcoin to buy back a few months later it obviously has to be in another currency.
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:29:26
Whatever. You’re stubborn. Point is was a great time to sell it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:50:54

@_date: 2019-07-13 11:35:31
Bitcoin doesn't care.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:14:58
Nothing stupid about it. It's obvious when Bitcoin drops (especially) or rises most of the alts do.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:34:46
It has to be a store of value first. Why hold any if the price will plummet, even against Bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-07-09 21:31:49
Beginning of the year would have been more appropriate.
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:08:53
Some are better holding. They just panic sell. Not the best reason.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:39:20
But Bitcoin is nowhere near prevalent enough for them to care. Only vendors who want Bitcoin for itself matter at this stage.
@_date: 2019-07-25 00:05:59
You’ve held since then? Or didn’t buy at 3K to even it out?

@_date: 2018-01-31 00:36:06
Not how I read it. Not a question of optimism. It isn't worded as implying a total ban. They've lawyers looking at this shit. It cannot be ambiguous.


Then they would hardly ban other coins. The buying frenzy affects all of them.

It doesn't matter if they are hobbies or not. Many buy art and comics especially in the hope that they will go up in value. Saying they're hobbies is a cop out. I could say Bitcoin is a hobby.
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:11:31


That's bull for a start. No one spends gold and yet it has value, not to mention the other things I listed. There's this misconception that spending gives a currency value. It's vice versa if anything.


That didn't help the Venezuelan currency. A finite or limited supply coupled with a large market cap keeps a currency stable.


You're not quoting me.
By the way, do you keep the Bitcoins you receive as Bitcoins?

Don’t use this story as a flimsy excuse to push your agenda. Bitcoin and the alts for that matter are all too volatile. Lightning wouldn’t make any difference in this case.

If he's not even sure I doubt it. I bought BTC 6 years ago and know exactly how much I have.
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:14:33
Maybe because the dollar is so weak now in comparison.
Anyway, check your client settings.
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:58:37

@_date: 2019-07-02 20:05:42
But muh karma.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:02:00
But why should the vendor want the Bitcoins if he'll just convert them? Most people with BTC also have credit cards.

They are both bought and sold.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:54:02
Buying Bitcoin is adoption. So if people are buying it for future returns? No governments to force us into using it like for fiat.
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:01:36

Did you sell at 60 cents?
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:49:40
Just think of it as a bank account. If your money is still 2K in a few years is that a bad thing?
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:33:29
And the puny hashrate.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:51:45
Coinbase won’t be around then hopefully.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:40:16
It’s meta. I think.
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:20:16


Peer to peer cash just means sending money without an intermediary. So Ethereum is that.
If you mean Bitcoin (or Ethereum) is not a currency, it cannot become a currency until it becomes a good store of value. A very volatile currency is problematic.
ETH is a competitor in the sense that people can either buy it or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:30:10
That’s easier said than done. Usually if I sell I just keep the fiat.

He got the MtGox yubikey. He good.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:55:55
You’re suggesting holding is easy or that many want to take profits on the way.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:43:45
It’s all their shitcoins had over Bitcoin. With Lightning and perhaps Libra they’ll be redundant. Even more redundant.
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:29:40
Not so good from January 2018.
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:57:42

Ok. Gold dropped 13% last summer.
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:26:38
Yes. That’s my point
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:16:10
They're desperate to get rid of it no doubt.
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:46:31
Something for the future maybe if Bitcoin is ever prevalent in paper form. Probably not though. Too controversial for an international base. Euros have no people on them.

The XRP tokens are not actually needed to transfer value. It is indeed a scam.

Bitcoin cash and others are the digital equivalent of museum shop prints of works of art. They might look almost as good as the real thing but they are worthless.

@_date: 2019-07-01 03:41:42
Not to mention the cost of the US military backing the dollar.

I don't remember LTC doing 5x when Bitcoin was "doing nothing". It did better than most alts. But has fallen against Bitcoin last month. It's easy to 5x anyway when you're starting from double figures.
Bitcoin's biggest challenger, Ethereum, appears to be on its knees. It doesn't have ICOs to help it out this time.

Why “sick”?
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:46:38
Hold. Or DCA. Or if you trade you need to buy when it looks terrible and sell when it looks great. Bitcoin is fairly predictable in the long run.
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:47:22
A broken spring.

A school of whales. And the alts are getting schooled.

If it’s still around you’d imagine so.
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:15:48
You seem to think forget gold is susceptible to third party risk. Bitcoin is more akin to an offshore account. And don’t give me the old “let’s not argue” as if you’ve already won.

Sooo... what?
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:46:33
But as a digital gold?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:44:43
It is a money - what do you expect? It's the attraction of making money from Bitcoin that stimulates adoption.

Short, then.

Completely invalid. And very presumptuous. No guarantee Bitcoin isn’t Facebook and the others aren’t Google+. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:33:53
Gold as a money has zero value in that case.

Disingenuous is the word.

Even if true then obviously Bitcoin has found another niche - as an asset/a digital gold.

It's too volatile anyway, fees or no fees. All the cryptos are. This fee concern is a red herring.
And this has nothing to do with centralisation anyway.

As a store of value it works perfectly fine.

What you’re doing now is fine. Just keep the paper wallet after you move the btc. The shitcoins will be on there. ie associated with the private key.

They feel threatened by this. And by Libra.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:05:31
This rise started a year ago because, I believe, of the halving.
The demand for Bitcoin bled over to the alts. They are the ones benefitting, the ones in a true bubble. There's no real raison d'être for 98% of these coins except to enrichen their developers.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:41:22

I guess you haven't seen it go to $20,000 recently. That looks like adoption to me. It doesn't go to that price by magic.

If they can't be arsed to use Segwit, yeah.

Gold is valuable because it’s rare and durable. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:35:44
Lots of posts saying this is petty, etc.
It's the community's job to defend Bitcoin.
No one's asking us to kill anyone over this. Just criticise bcash misappropriating the Bitcoin name and riding on its coat tails. And that's fair enough.

That scared me and I bought below 200.

Unlikely. It would be snapped up in seconds anyway.

Segwit vs Segwit2X  proved them wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:04:17
The point is though that gold is being used as a store of value. And countries are not doing it in case they want to make more jewellery.

In which case why should Bitcoin lose out to something else?


I quoted myself to remind you of what I said I wasn't reinforcing a point. We've been over this.
You're arguments about jewellery v. holdings are dubious. Just because there is more demand doesn't mean there is more gold in jewellery. If there is a demand that suggests there isn't enough.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:27:18
Then they cannot complain.

@_date: 2017-12-25 13:52:00
Since Bitcoin is finite in supply and production of bitcoins half every 4 years it’s a no brainer it will rise long term.

Bitcoin started from zero.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:11:53
It is an alt coin. It doesn't matter if it's technically similar. It's not fungible with Bitcoin, it doesn't share a faction of the trading pairs Bitcoin has, it's not recognised by exchanges as BTC, etc etc.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:01:10
That’s Steam’s doing. Not Bitcoin’s. Do they accept gold?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:08
Neither does gold in that case.
As a competitor to Visa or Paypal it doesn't work and neither does bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:08:27
Billions are being stored in cryptos already that are not being stored in banks. That's competition.

If you want to compete with Visa you have be capable of sending 2000 transactions per second. BCH handles nowhere near that so being a bit faster than Bitcoin won’t cut it.

US dollars only have value because people agree that they have. 
Bitcoin is just speculation? Who gives a fuck? If that encourages adoption that’s what matters. In 2015 it was at 200 dollars for months. What kept it at that? Speculation? Or faith in it?
It’s not simply speculation anyway. It had a finite, diminishing supply. The US dollar is printed at whim.

If you truly believe you might even enjoy it.

Let's nipple this in the bud right now.

It could down 90% and still be higher than a year ago.

He did cry about it on the other place.
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:12:22
Dictionaries are updated constantly now. 
Anyway, "alegal" suggests that something that is or may be illegal. "Amoral" an "atheism" are more or less the opposite of "moral" and "theist".
I would use "legal" or "illegal" or "unknown".
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:17:17
Some profound misunderstanding of Bitcoin on here. As if it exists only for transactions. Or is a kind of a stock.
Bitcoin stores value free from government intervention. It's like having your own private Swiss Bank account. You send money anywhere to anyone at anytime without fear of it being reversed or seized. Some other blockchains (ETH) cannot even guarantee that 100%.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:35:28
That’s no guarantee. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:33:34
Oh dear. You should have done the opposite. I don't understand anyway. Surely you got free BCH during the fork. Why buy more?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:29:14
Why not. Bitcoin keeps its good name.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:04:02
It's obviously a fake.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:05:02
That comment in itself is propaganda. Comparing a technology sub to an evil dictatorship. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:30:15
A much bigger market cap will help.

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:23:41
I then said: The value comes from it being scarce and durable. Most gold is stored in vaults collecting dust.
Perhaps we were talking at cross purposes slightly.
I see, by the way you made a reference to Myspace and Netscape Navigator.
Switching from browsers or social networks carries 0 financial risk.

And they wanted the S2X fork with no replay protection.

If ETH had stuff built on it people would be drooling. I can't understand the qualms about Lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:41:40
Are we supposed to believe Andreas doesn't own at least 100 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:13
When enough people have bought it and the likes of lightning is out and the market cap is so high it is less volatile, then it can function better as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:02:40
And it was not Bitcoin's fault. You're the one playing games.
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:41:24


That is not what makes Bitcoin valuable. It's the fact that is secured in this way that it is valuable.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:22:33
And this one?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:46:44
Jurassic Park?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:13:33
So is it or isn't a currency? If it isn't then it's a digital gold, a commodity. And I don't see anything wrong with that.
Segwit and lightning will make it a better payment network in time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:21:16
Who says you can't buy things with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:01:56
Nothing compared to the price rises.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:01:05
Come on. You credit memes and Reddit with too much power.


Just like any money nowadays. Money is construct of society. You think aliens would accept US dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:07:29
In 2050.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:21
So you know what you are doing?
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:39:11
Yes, and where's your response to that?  Are you seriously saying gold is more useful than water?
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:39:21
The comparison with gold is as a store of value - which is where gold gets most of its value.

I'd a feeling the top comments would be people defending the dollar.

Wasn't this posted recently?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:58
Let's stick to BTCUSD, otherwise what's the point?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:56
@_date: 2019-07-01 03:25:28
Then accept Bitcoin because you want Bitcoin and not like you be idiotically obsessed with the current exchange rate. If I wanted it converted to fiat I’d do it myself. 
I wouldn’t spend my precious coins on shit like this anyway. The last time I bought something with Bitcoin it was worth $40. Which makes me glad I didn’t buy more stuff with it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:48:57
Maybe the market puts security and decentralization first. Not transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:56:41
People in this case are not buying the software or a license to use it. The software is an enabler. They are agreeing that a unit of Bitcoin has a value, just as people agree that a $100 paper bill is worth $100 or the equivalent in services. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:23:24
"Stolen". I don't like these emotive headlines.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:43:31
I meant Bitcoin obviously. The usual argument being it isn’t used in jewellery or electronics. As if that’s a reason why gold is so valued. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:59:29
Social networks carry no financial risk for users.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:31:23
You don’t think keeping your assets safe from being seized and safe from inflation and borderless is not useful?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:39
15,000 would suggest it is being adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:32:55
Ah, OK.
I did buy a few dozen ETH at 80 and below. Disappointed recently. You think it will take off?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:25:13
Except they haven't stopped using gold.
@_date: 2018-09-19 00:42:16
You’re here only 3 months. Get with it. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 19:44:04
They outlawed exchanges.

God forbid anyone should ask for proof.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:11:09
Bitcoin chuckles at Steam and keeps forging ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:40:56


That's the not only thing though. And there are other reasons people put there money into Bitcoin. They don't want it to be seized by the government or they want to send money to anywhere or to anyone.
Blockchain is worthless without the incentive of a coin behind it.


That's what gold is.
If the power goes out we're all doomed anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:26:18
We've seen that vendor acceptance has played only a tiny part in BTC's success so far.
None of them are good currencies at the moment. All too volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:33:59
It might solve some congestion but it makes the network marginally less secure.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:59
A meme is born.

They said it could go 40x a few years ago. Looks like there are right so far.
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:30:43
They sell Samsung products now?
Same according to this (starting price). In fact the Samsung a dollar more.
@_date: 2018-09-15 23:01:37
Bitcoin has a history of recovering though.

You are lucky it's only "impeach".
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:06:35
I think they have a shitload of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:48:21
And the others are too volatile.
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:58:36
BTC's price drop is not related to diluting the supply etc. It's due to greed and then panic selling.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:29:17
Bcash, you mean.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:24:54
2015 was like that at 200.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:34:52
Yes, but why accept Bitcoin if you don't want the Bitcoin for itself?
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:35:51
Me too. Although went even higher.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:16:32


Hodl. That's all you can do now. Or sell at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:13:37
Like Segwit and Lightning? Making blocks a bit bigger is not good enough. BCH transactions are still very puny compared to Visa.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:31
Have a source for this? And Segwit is included?
You're here a week anyway. How would you know what's changed?

It already has a killer application - censorship resistant, deflationary sore of value.

Hard to tell if joking.
Anyway, just wait 5 years or so.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:57:18
But it is going up. Long term at east. It could crash 90% and still be higher than a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:00
Adoption will be slow anyway. Like Segwit. Is the demand really there for low fees? Looks like FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:39:55
Platinum is too scarce.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:50:17
I was wondering. Did the last halving contribute to higher fees? I've rarely seen this considered.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:54:59
However, they are not Bitcoin. Not fungible, not compatible and the markets know which is the real thing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:41:47
2013. And I wish I hadn’t. Bitcoin was $40. I spent two. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:52
Hearing that all year. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:37:33
And volatility - which they all coins suffer from.
You seem to love Steam more it seems if them dropping it worries you. It's only one vendor.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:59:37


Such as???
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:44:25
Not to mention your straw man replies.

I know it isn't the same. But we can see where most of the gold is.

Well, has it crashed? So there you go.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:13:17
Selling doesn't help Bitcoin's volatility. And if they can't keep the Bitcoins as Bitcoins (why else accept them after all?) then maybe they shouldn't accept them at all.

Didn't he make Bitcoin finite and deflationary? Bad move.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:52:41
Political reasons. They supposedly wanted lower fees thus the S2x fork but now won't adopt Segwit. Perhaps the planed fork was not over fees.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:55:56
I prefer Safari.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:39:24
I would be happy doing this especially for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:20:49
Many would pay much higher fees just to be safe though. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:35:36
Have to laugh at those using this as an indictment against Bitcoin.
Like the guy would know about the fee situation or even what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:57:53
Because it’s one single vendor not accepting an asset that does a lot more than be a payments network. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:30:15


Any reason to think that is likely?


That seems another matter.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:47:08
You're not supposed to hold everything. And the rest for a few years.
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:59:49
I know water isn't rare - which is exactly my point. Gold is valuable because it is rare (but not to rare). There are far more useful elements or compounds than gold (like water) but they are not as highly valued because they are plentiful or too indefinite.
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:57:49


Source for that?
And how much energy do people, say, waste going to lunch everyday instead of eating in the office?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:35
If it doesn't go down in price it would have to be pegged to the dollar, the way Tether is. "Doesn't go down" is relative. It might go down relative to Bitcoin.
I'd rather you gave me real example.
Going up means there's less chance of BTC losing value obviously.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:12:20
Not directly related to the blockchain. Yet. But anything that has faster txs there has to be a trade off.

It and every alt are and always have been poor currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:13:17
They mentioned volatility as a reason also. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:21:44
Why do you think txs should be a gift and not paid for?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:24:50
Do we? Never felt the need to use one.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:49:45
Up 180 million per cent in 7-8 years is hard to argue against. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:03:16
First mover advantage, better security, more decentralised. You might as well ask, since Bitcoin was created first why were the others needed?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:20
It will still rule as a digital gold.
@_date: 2018-09-24 03:43:00

Really? Worked with the Russians to get Trump in the white house.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:07:25
It can be but Bitcoin has greater longevity, more scarce and has the network effect. Why choose Litecoin if something better comes out? Where does it end? One coin has to be chosen for the role.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:01:58
They'll be bloated as well. And be challenged by newcomers.

It's more widely accepted than any other crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:33
Doesn’t count. USD equivalent. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:45:46
Yeah. Of the future. ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:24:52


Because that's not what gives it value. Why should people accept it in the first place unless they desire it? And why should they desire it? Because it's un-seizable, borderless, on an immutable blockchain. And scarce. That's what gives it value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:15:13
This is why it so important to call it Bcash. I'm disappointed at exchanges listing it as Bitcoin Cash.

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:38:40
The future.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:30
Cringe at $13000. Looks like the markets don’t give a damn. BCH meanwhile is dipping. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:06:42
Your coins would still be safe till it comes back. If it doesn't then it may not matter.
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:45:09
But it's primarily Venezuela. As you say there are already ways to pay for a latte.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:11:39
Just as you heard about Segwit for years.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:00
Not Segwit txs as far as I can see.
Nobody is using BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:50:39
You pay anyone anywhere. (Wikileaks for example).
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:50:39
He thinks Satoshi is Craig Wright. Perhaps not the best to comment.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:59:07
Sounds like bullshit to me. Since when were they averse to money? And as if religion would stop them anyway. They are not above drinking alcohol behind closed doors.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:35:59
10X the Mt Gox high in 2013?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:36:06
McDonalds is shit. I wouldn't waste my Bitcoins in there - especially if they have the potential to go 10x.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:40:54
It's your own personal Swiss bank account, it can used to send value 24/7 to any country without fear of being seized, sometimes anonymously. That's the point.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:34:06
Ho ho. Better to get instead of rushing things like in Eth for example.
@_date: 2018-09-18 04:42:38
Shows the potential is there though.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:57:54
Or a currency not susceptible to corrupt dictators.
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:08:27
No, it's not. Just don't lie about dead children.
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:20:37
No worse than Samsung’s top phones. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:48:20
They are all too volatile to be good currencies anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:59:17
Who supported it?
Anyway, Bcash has no Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:05:01
It never was a good currency. Who wants to spend something could be 100x in a few years? The alts are the same, or most of them.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:33:13
Alt simply means alternative to Bitcoin. Don't get worked up over it in a Ver-like fervour.
I own some Monero by the way. Not to mention a dozen others. So don't assume anything.


Does it even have a GUI wallet yet?
@_date: 2018-09-17 04:48:54
There are always apologists on here when banking or fiat currencies are compared unfavorably with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 17:28:48
Your retort isn’t. Explain. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:14:43
It’s Spanish not English. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:00:02
We had 13% drops even last year.
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:26:36
Traditional pie charts can be misleading.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:37:02
They can use Bitcoin Cash, but we’re just as free to call it Bcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:59:14
Unfortunately he's more likely to on the dark side.
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:22:12
So it's up to you to hide the key in a way they cannot get it. How hard can that be?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:30:05


It IS called r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:41
But not of centralisation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:33:51
So therefore it means something.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:19:04
In 6 months could be 20,000 or 5,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:58:02
You’re assuming the guy knows which ones are currencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:43:59
You're a troll. It's storing billions of dollars of value safe from seizure. That's a use.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:01:49
With less security.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:55:00
TheDAO was related to a solidity bug. And forking killed ETH's credibility.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:00:31
Bitcoin doesn’t need Steam any more than a Rolls Royce needs a bumper sticker.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:12:44
Better. Andreas won't bash bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:00:32
If you're stupid enough to believe this is real and have no sense of humour, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:23:52
You have a source for this?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:41:54
2X? What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:56:19
Bitcoin probably has made him rich. He's worried about fees?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:43:19
Read the comic anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:34:21
The non-monetary reasons add very little to its value. There are metals more useful industrially which are valued less. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:30:11
Should a money have to be backed by a military? And they say Bitcoin is wasteful. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:26:30
They do seem rather snobbish about it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:37:06
It was going for 9 years and an alt was going to take its place overnight?
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:39:19
I sold my alts. Or the major ones at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:58:33
I didn’t say it was better. I said it was faster - or claims to be. Still has had problems with empty blocks and so on. Doesn’t have Segwit etc. 
My point was BTC’s network effect/first mover advantage is so strong that BCH has to be vastly faster to supplant it. 
In any case lightning will blow BCH’s puny transactions per second out of the water. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:32




Exhibit A
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:38:11
There are however many other things that "waste" electricity that get a pass. Why isn't video-gaming or any leisure activity considered a waste of resources?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:09:00
They're not trying to dangerously fork Bitcoin, obstruct Segwit or claim Bgash is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:04:25
If it's increasing it's a good thing surely.
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:51:53
It's valuable primarily because it's rare not because it's used in circuits.
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:16:29
So we keep nearing but if it’s higher all the better for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:44:56
If that's CGI I'm blown away.
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:42:27
It did recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:47:45
It works but not the way you want it. Storing value in the most decentralised blockchain is a thing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:30:24
Adopts anonymity you mean?
Bitcoin is still more desired than XMR however.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:34
Fewer weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:36:16
Unpredictable investment scheme?
Definitely on an upward long term trend regardless of crashes and bubbles due to it's finite and reducing supply.
Its strength? Store of value. On an immutable, decentralized blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:28:47
If everyone is doing it on chain all the more reason to do it off chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:25:38
For 9 years it’s been on an upward trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:53
And yet they won't use Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:51:04
Maybe people are not buying it just for the sake of owning one. They want to store some of their savings there for example.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:29
Nobody on here has said this. Better than gold maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:37:09
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:12:24
Not sarcasm I hope. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:14:08
Coinbase is shit. That's not a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:33
The constant dismissing of Segwit is fishy.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:50:24
I bought throughout 2013. And sold for a similar price to recoup investment. But this year! I might as well have waited. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:00:52
Is that like the White Paper?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:36:14
He wanted primarily no third party having control. That's still very much the case.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:15:52
Pity he was bitching on rbtc about paying fees for shifting 86 million dollars.
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:26:38
The only one? Good luck surviving on gold in a desert. Perhaps you should read Dune.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:02:16
Gold can be seized easily. It cannot be sent to anywhere over the internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:32:05




@_date: 2018-09-05 22:00:21
Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:01:53
Because a finite, deflationary money won't go up anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:12:22
Nothing in history has risen like Bitcoin. Anyone who has bought and held at least two or three years has made a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:38:51
And your aunt will become your uncle when she grows balls. If if if.

As opposed to your dumping/FUD strategy?
@_date: 2018-09-23 19:52:53
3K unlikely. Market is a bit more mature. Even now there is a fear of losing out in a few years.

You must be Swiss or something. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:58:43
Ireland. Not Russia or China. A completely free society.
Who said anything about taxes anyway? Some countries seize your money even if you've done nothing wrong. 


Your words not mine. Maybe I just want my own personal bank. A cryptocurrency allows that.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:13:37
It’s gained market share in the last few months. 
And market share should not be a preoccupation of developers. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:09:54
They store value in way safe from governments. They are not just stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:52:41
More like Xbox versus a cheap Chinese knock off. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:57:16

Who’s upvoting this?
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:43:14
Clueless comments as usual on this type of thing, defending the banks.
Bitcoin is valuable exactly because it is secured in this way.

It's made him rich.
@_date: 2018-09-20 17:26:15

@_date: 2018-09-22 05:15:02
Yeah, he is such a nice guy.
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:41:53
Txs do not give something value. Gold is barely transacted.
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:52:07


He says nothing incorrect there.
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:07:56
You don't have any arguments. You certainly don't understand the concept of rarity.

@_date: 2017-12-24 01:55:42
If it's holding value it's like a bank. And one open 27/7 and unseizable.

As opposed to your ad hominems and evasiveness.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:19:55

@_date: 2017-12-01 03:11:32
And drools over the overhyped ETH.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:05:16
USD equivalent. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:31
Did you miss the word "recently"? Nowhere near 500%.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:00:33


Not true at all.
The value comes from it being scarce and durable. Most gold is stored in vaults collecting dust.


That doesn't create more Bitcoin. It's not fungible with Bitcoin. It doesn't have its infrastructure, developers etc.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:02:22
If the supply affects the fees it can only be because of the last halving's effect on miners.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:40:18
Should have used Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:11:53
And how would r/all littered with mindless memes and gifs know anything about economics? And how would bitcoiners not be able to brigade their own sub?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:07
It'll go back at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:58:51
200 million per cent rise in 7-8 years says otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 02:16:42
Yeah, the problem with fiat currencies is that they have to be nursed. Not just with a military, but the issuance etc.

ITT: Captain Obvious’s saying it’s not the real Satoshi.

Crashing or rising hundreds of dollars in hours has little to do with transaction speed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:05:01
He may have meant "your" in a plural sense.
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:49:25
Maybe you should try elaborating then, instead of churning out lazy answers.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:15:37
Nice, but the white paper is already in danger of being turned into a manifesto or holy book.
Better to use some economic or philosophical work that inspired Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:36:49
Because they don't suck up to the bankers?
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:45:40
Me too. Perhaps when the market cap is a lot bigger it will be more stable.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:35:22
Even with small blocks it can be a digital gold. Spare us the death hyperbole.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:48:54
Crypto-anarchists don't suck up to the IRS.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:20:03
Didn't even recoup your original investment?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:17:08
Long term it is. 14-15x since last year.
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:14:22
Old enough to remember the seventies, runt.
And of course your money and be seized. If not by governments then debt collection agencies for example. Unjustly in my case once. Long story. Would never trust a fucking bank with a large amount again.
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:24:17
Certainly. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:28:23
That’s not what I was saying. Anyway to take your point, a currency shouldn’t be susceptible to a country’s legislation. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:28:58
This is cringeworthy. Why are you on here?
Perhaps if the government seized your money you wouldn't so pro-establishment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:03:15
Holding it as far as I'm concerned is using it.
I want more money from seizure. That's a utility. Not buying video games. There are plenty of ways of doing that.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:46:39


Not much good if BCH is centralised. And doesn't have Segwit.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:56:27
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:51:42
Shouldn't have "diversified".
Anyway, you could sell this as a stock image and get something.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:46:19
Really? Looks like one shot to me. :-P
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:19:45
Get those who rant about fees to use it.
@_date: 2018-09-21 15:44:20
Speak for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:13:08
He's posted on this page.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:22:01
Ladies would not appreciate this "joke".
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:54:44
Bitcoin has RSK. Smart contracts are a dead end though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:27:12
If you put so much importance to this how is BTC anything better than a credit card?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:16
It’s nothing. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:30:33
I said other unfair practices also. Loans are not intrinsic to Bitcoin. Yeah, I know and nor are they to the dollar - but it doesn't have to take the blame re:loans. The stupidity is repeated all right.
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:01:10
I should have said even in a bull market these dips happen. They think Bitcoin is stable?
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:41:54
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:56:20
With Bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:31:35


We cannot do both?
It's the developers' jobs to improve Bitcoin anyway. The community's job to defend it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:24:52
Can run him down.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:13:09
How can they be enforced and what's to stop Buterin rolling back again like he did after theDAO fiasco? Anyway, Bitcoin can do (simpler (and therefore safer)) smart contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:49
Why so much? I sent 20btc for 9 dollars recently and I only paid that high to be sure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:05:47
Wiping your butt?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:36:36
I thought it was the 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:26:52
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:09:14


Now you’re being silly. 
The whole fee thing has been overstated. Most of it stemming from new users not knowing how to configure wallets properly, Coinbase and like being sluggish at adopting Segwit and general gross exaggeration like yours above. 
It was cheaper a couple of years ago because it was $200 and had fewer users. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:38:04
Stubborn lot. Only Satoshi's vision (i.e. software) will do.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:05:49


You are allowed to draw the line you know. Don't be afraid. And most of the media thankfully are nothing like him.


Give me a fucking break. Tell that to the parents who have had to move house several times because of harassment.
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:22:24
Yes, but email has been pretty much supplanted by messaging services.
Not every country will need Bitcoin but those that have restrictions on sending or storing money will.
The physical music industry put up a fight but the pirates and then Spotify, iTunes etc won.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:13:23
The old Myspace argument.
Bitcoin is a revolutionary protocol not a mere website.
And switching between social networks carries no financial risk.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:23:58
He said decentralization not anonymity.
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:31:10
Or no one cares - as should be the case.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:53:22
Pray tell. Which ones?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:57:05
So how much would the Eth be worth now?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:48:22
You have had it all that time and you only saw it as a currency?
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:30:16
I remember Bitcoin at $13.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:03:24
And gained several million per cent in 9 years.
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:07:02
Closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. They have to have because they are more easily stolen or seized - the latter by some governments. 
Anyway we are talking about keeping your money away from the authorities, not just from thieves. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:53:43
Good thing for him.
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:24:26
Who said anything about nations?
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:11:28
We don't make gold but arguably it's invented to as a money. We all agree it has value although it's only of use to an advanced society. It can't be eaten of course, or keep you warm.
@_date: 2018-09-17 02:01:32
I don't think it is whataboutism. Many claim it's the US military that helps "back" the dollar.
And how better to secure Bitcoin? There isn't one at present. Perhaps more effort should be made to develop greener energy?
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:48:47
Bitcoins are intended for humans are they not? A money free from the central banks and secured in the best way we have so far.
Where's the hullabaloo over power wasted manufacturing, maintaining, dismantling military weapons performed by the governments of the world?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:51:13
Centralized, inflationary, seizable, with borders? No. None of these.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:45:47
At least can send to any country 27/7. Anyway - Segwit.

Or maybe they own Bitcoin because they think it will happen. I don't think their word is enough to drive the price up.

The euros I exchanged for Bitcoins in 2013 are not looking so good now in comparison.

Good luck with your premined centralised coins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:57:29
They use Segwit. Did you?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:33
Hope so. Want to sell my bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:00
That doesn't make it OK.

Thankfully consumers are not developing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:08:37
How much power is that consuming/wasting? We don't hear anything about that.

Well, it's not. Not yet. And neither is the forked coin.

Stop apologizing for them. It’s embarrassing. 
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:12:20
Plus whole thing is a gimmick. No one uses dapps, it’s not censorship resistant and centralized databases are vastly cheaper.
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:51:04
It's more safe than the alternatives.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:49:39
There's still the 10 minutes at least. Probably more - even with BCH's supposedly faster txs. Bitcoin could've crashed or risen a few hundred dollars in the current market.

Why use them you could argue if Bitcoin is good enough? 
Anyway Bitcoin is the most trusted, longest running, most decentralized and most immutable blockchain.

@_date: 2018-09-17 01:31:23
The problem with fiat currencies is that they have be nursed and supervised by a government/central bank. They can't sustain themselves. Bitcoin can. And I mean by that the protocol takes care of the issuance, supply etc.

When it was stuck at $200 for months? Less volatility and lower price means fees will be cheaper but if we want more people using the price will have to rise substantially and there will be growing pains.

If you’re buying Ethereum for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:48:55
Pure FUD.
Bitcoin has carved a niche at present as a digital gold.
Lightning will bring faster payments for those who want it it.
Bcash is nowhere near fast enough to compete with Visa.

Maybe overbought.

Well of course there is always some doubt. Human nature. Anyway I know they’ll get it back if it doesn’t. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:49:21
They weren't talking about the price.
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:42:00
You stating that doesn't make that true. Most of gold is lying in vaults.
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:14:53
So it'd be much easier to take from a regular bank account.
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:40:51
Why does it have to be accepted (by vendors I presume you mean) to be valuable?
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:34:37
Technically it can be much higher.

Balderdash. It's simply untrue that Bitcoin is standing still. This a myth perpetuated amongst many alt users. Segwit, fibre, Schnorr, MAST, TumbleBit, MimbleWimble, Lightning to name a few technologies in the works.
Even without this Bitcoin is the most decentralized and secure coin. This is more important than fast, cheap transactions - which will come anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:42:24

When comparing Bitcoin with gold obviously we’re comparing their monetary aspects. Gold anyway is not so valued because of jewellery and electronics (recent development only). It’s valued because it’s rare and durable. 
As for what Bitcoin was intended as, it’s irrelevant if people want to use it as a store of value then they will. 
Satoshi appears to have been inspired by gold anyway. Bitcoin has parallels. And not just symbolic or nominal. It is mined in a way that mirrors the competition and the   production in the real world. And it is finite with diminishing returns over time. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:12:34
There’s nothing wrong with measuring it in dollars. It’s one of the main reasons people hold btc - as a hedge against fiat devaluation 
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:00:51

That's not a fault with Bitcoin per se. Simply need to sort out the infrastructure.

So what would be an alegal act?

Current problems didn't stop it going to near 20,000. A lot of it is FUD caused by people not knowing how to use their wallets, blaming BTC for Coinbase's fees and not using Segwit.

Ok, my bad. But general dismissing a comment as by a two year or my comparisons as silly is fallacious. You need to demonstrate why. You haven't always done that. There's nothing wrong with comparing water with gold. Sure, water is very common. We take that for granted. Saying gold is more useful relative to its availability is not an answer.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:21:37
Small market cap leads to instability. The instability is not intrinsic to Bitcoin. Anyway, it's been pretty stable for most of this year.

It's a bear market. What are you expecting?

Straw-manish and evasive.

If certain conditions are met, I'm sure he said. If it takes a small percentage of gold's market cap etc.
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:24:37
Most of those things very unlikely to say the least. Lack of fungibility is hardly a Bitcoin-killer.

Still far better than gold in that respect.

Not worried about mass adoption. The masses ignore gold except as jewelry.
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:33:55
So you're saying Bitcoin's dominance is even higher?

Nothing to do with the price. Problem was there in November 2013.
@_date: 2015-06-19 09:21:32
Quite stable last few months. Would be just a short term solution for some anyway. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:57:29
Sure, the technology is the same as it was in 1994. Whatever. If you say so.
There are Kenyans sending Bitcoins from the cell phones. The average Americans didn't have the internet in 1994.
In any case, buying bitcoins is pretty easy - any difficulties are usually caused by legal reasons. Nothing to with infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:07:44
Percentage-wise it's quite big. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:44:11
If you're day-trading it's a gamble. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 01:00:49
I've been in it since early 2013. So, no, not new. Sure people want to make money but a lot of people but like having complete ownership of their money. It's not just about profits.

As opposed to dump dump dump? Either way would suit him. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:28:42
I doubt that very much. Anyway, luckily it's software, and so can be modified.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:43:52
It's lost some its holders. Bitcoin itself is doing OK.

His point still stands, then.
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:05:18
Newsflash: that's not due to rampant money-printing, or other unfair practices. There's a fundamental difference.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:29:01
How is it hard to understand? Do you actually own any? If you're fully in Bitcoin it's usage is practically free and unhindered.

@_date: 2018-09-17 17:56:40
Bitcoin mining: Useful who anyone who wants 100% control of their own money.
Gold as I have stated is not valued so highly because of its industrial uses. This is a recent thing anyway. The ancient Egyptians did not make laptops. And steel and aluminium are far more useful.
Bitcoin's consumption of electricity is nothing compared to the US dollar's backing by the US military. Trillions wasted?

Except for the dumbass Deutschmark comparison. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:42:30


In which case why do we need Bitcoin?
Being a digital gold is nothing to sniff at.
It dropped that low due to new weak ends. It didn't stay at 11,000 for long.
It's 16 x since a year ago. Zoom out more.


You seem to think Bitcoin is only for txs. A glorified paypal.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:45:43
Well, at least BTC won't be seized or frozen and is borderless.
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:58:19
He could tell everyone to sell and buy in cheap causing the price to rise again. He can't win. Or rather he can.
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:01:50
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:38:26
Unlikely. He could sell before it goes that far anyway.

Not worried about mass adoption. The masses ignore gold except as jewelry.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:01:31

Don't blame us for your reckless speculating. Anyway you can make money trading if you're sure the price will drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:45:12
If you think Bitcoin is just another Paypal you’re free to think that. 
Bitcoin couldn’t give a fuck. It’ll keep marching on. It has bigger fish to fry. 
Steam could have accepted 0 confirmation or green addresses. 
I don’t buy this transactions too slow bullshit in this case.

No ETA on the ETF? WTF?
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:06:19
All you need is the internet, a PC and a bank account or debit card to buy bitcoins. Surely you have them? If you don't then buying bitcoin is the least of your worries.
@_date: 2015-12-18 10:18:30
The infrastructure is already largely in place for Bitcoin so that cannot be the case. Late 90s more like.
@_date: 2018-09-17 02:12:48
Which add little to its value. There are more useful metals in industry. Obviously Bitcoin is only similar to gold monetarily. Although its lack of physicality allows it do things gold cannot - like be transported instantly across the world.

Evolved or from creatures which evolved.

You have a point. Even on here there's often too much caring about stuff like vendor acceptance, as if that's all Bitcoin has to offer.

Yes, they wanted your coins. Why? So when they pump up the price again.

The market is not moved by news. People thought the Starbucks element was more important anyway which shows what they know.


The last year rejection of the Winklevoss ETF at $1200 didn't stop us going to 20k, so I'm not buying that at all.

But no one wants it.

How long was it at 500? A few hours. It's been at about 220 for months.

I don't think ETF will change things short term even if approved.

@_date: 2018-08-06 23:39:51
The problem with the dollar is that there are far more units in circulation and the supply CAN be changed. Can't even change the block size in BTC. I can't see any sane reason to increase the supply.
Bitcoin is useful (censorship-resitant means of storing and sending value anywhere without fear of being seized) and rare. That's what gives it value.
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:45:30
He's trying to scam people.
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:27:07
They didn't the push the price that high. That was due to people foolishly taking out big loans and going all in.

Neither are bitcoin's fault. Get a better bank. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:40:16
What I meant is we have technology like Wifi, cell phones, fast computers, fast connections, slick interfaces, etc. that the early internet  did not have - which would benefitted it greatly. In other words, everything is already in place for Bitcoin to flourish.

Maybe because it only has 10% of total crypto trade. Hopefully things like this will rectify that.
And you have a source for this figure?

No. Christmas lights are a big waste of money but it hasn’t stopped adoption. Mining, anyway, is securing the network so it’s not a waste.

Anyway, he did say "gambling ". 
@_date: 2018-08-05 18:43:31


Well obviously. I don't believe the price is sentient.
What I meant is if we're in a bull or bear market, no news will stop the rise or fall. That will only when the bubble pops or when the bottom has been reached.
Bitcoin had a fair bit of bad news last year. China banning exchanges, Winklevoss ETF not accepted (previous time), but the price kept rising with a few dips only.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:47:36
Wouldn't be that surprising. To condemn it all likelihood.
Vatican itself tweeting about Bitcoin would be more improbable.
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:35:06
I'm sick of hearing about the handful who bought at 20K. Fuck them.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:45:38
Bear market. Why didn’t up with the Bakkt news?
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:17:22
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:40:43
Looks manipulated a bit. Or just post bubble bearish. No good reason for the price to go down. ETF decision was just postponed, the Winklevoss one wasn't even on the radar, Bakkt was very positive news.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:59:22
What are yours?  It’s dead. It’s going to zero etc?  
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:05:36
Then be careful when you buy. Don't do it out of FOMO in the middle of a bubble.

I think censorship resistance is one of important foundations on which Bitcoin must be built. 
I’d question how useful smart contracts are when they can possibly be reversed as we saw two years. Also I don’t see they’ll be enforced in the real world. 
Bitcoin can do smart contracts anyway. Not as sophisticated but at least with fewer points of failure. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:05:29
The longer it lasts the stronger it will become. Something having supposed better tech won't cut it.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:51:29
It can handle a lot more though. And it isn't there just for transactions. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:11:30
Or it needs to replace money supply to hit $213,000?
They'd still call it a bubble anyway.
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:13:55


They do? An ETF will not affect Bitcoin per se. Just the price.
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:25:10
You told me this already. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:43:14
BCH? Really?
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:52:29
Not it is not an issue. Unfortunately there is no better way to secure a blockchain at present. 
And it is not a Whataboutism. It might have been if I had said what about all the electricity banks used. I say might because I don't think even then it would be. 
There are many things that "waste" electricity but which for some reason get a pass. Although it's up to individuals how they use their own electricity. How about complaining that there aren't enough green ways of producing power?
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:33:08

A fork is an attempt to replace/update the current coin with a new version and for that to be accepted as the same, updated thing. Bch is not accepted as Bitcoin except by Roger Ver and a few others. I’m not sure they believe it. It’s an altcoin like Litecoin. Also derived from Bitcoin.

It's a good way to get people to adopt it.

Because nearly all of the coins will have been mined so as to make little difference. And if Bitcoin isn’t $ 1m or more by 2030 it will be because it probably has failed.

More or less. In since 2013. But in truth no one like to see the price go down - unless you want to buy more.

@_date: 2018-08-13 04:55:55
The fact that it stopped being backed by gold - that savers were at the mercy of the fed - shows that the public were wise not to hoard dollars. No one expects the supply or whatever of Bitcoin to be changed in a few years. 
Even if it were widely accepted I think people would prefer to pull out their credit card instead of spending their precious Bitcoins - which have bigger fish to fry.

Fiat by definition is government approved. No one is forcing you to use Bitcoin therefore it needs a "come on". The idea of it rising in value is mostly what makes people adopt it.

Dude it's a well known term. It's not like bollinger bands or shorting or bear market.
In any case the word "fiat" on it's own is not a financial term. As I said it means "a decree". Thus, currency by decree.

It depends on how define its utility. Since it can be used as a store of value simply keeping as much as you want in it is itself useful. Don't think of buying the bitcoin so much as storing value in it.

But everyone will not sell all their crypto in one go so it's a silly hypothesis. Anyway coins can be auctioned or sold face to face without anyone knowing and not affect the market.
Right, I'm sure they are not worried about crypto. Just as the music industry wasn't worried about Napster and Pirate Bay. They are fools if they are not concerned.
The crypto market is just starting. There's nothing technically to stop it going to trillions.

Paper = gold circuits, Shakespearean literature = Bitcoin. I don't understand how you don't see the analogy.
My point is (some) golden circuits making Bitcoin software possible to run does not make gold more important. It's important for other reasons.
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:27:59
A very naive example. There are still only 100 using the coin even after Amazon accept it? And how is the price going to rise to $200 if 90 decide to hold?

Storing, sending and verifying Bitcoin is far more convenient and far cheaper than storing transporting and assaying gold.


It is if you want to send it to anyone anywhere at anytime.
Banks and cards at present may be faster but you have to trust them with your funds.

Trump may be immune from prosecution. Also Mueller may be playing games with him. 
The link is months old anyway. The results are already in. 
It wouldn’t matter if Trump himself was the target anyway. Clearly there’s been collusion. Although it’s chilling the way the way he sucks up to Putin.

It may cause dips, or whales might want it to appear so, but if the price wants to shoot up or plummet no news will stop it.
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:02:39
Then why be interested in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:32:31
It’s not the only factor that matters. And you’ve gone from rarity to something with no limit. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:46:55
It was last posted a year ago. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:27:03
It's a joke.
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:01:47
And that's Bitcoin's fault? Or you choosing a bad time?
@_date: 2018-08-16 18:04:55


That's virtually where all their value comes from. People missed out on Bitcoin and want similar returns from an alt.
But I think there is very little chance another coin will de-throne Bitcoin due to its headstart and maturity etc. But even if one did, who would trust it not to have the same fate?
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:14:58
That old Bitcoin wallets will ignore the modern network?
An alt is an alternate coin to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:03:23
Leave, then.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:25:21
Do they have Starbucks there?

Not having outages. Not suddenly trading BCH without prior notice. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 20:20:31
If you care about payments.
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:58:37
You mean it's stable?
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:39:41
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:28:55
Long term Bitcoin is unquestionably better.
Gold is stable because the price is manipulated or capped even in a way Bitcoin's cannot be.

That's their press statement in a picture pretty much.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:23:19
Not old enough to be posted again.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:27:17
So was posted correspondence and carrier pigeons.
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:23:13
I said they had said. And they did. How can I myself prove it conclusively?
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:09:29
Same difference. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:58:28
Who knows but 25 is a nice stash. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:25:18

@_date: 2014-11-26 02:20:37

I think we'll see more bubbles. I think too much is being read into this report.
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:16:14
It’s not a whataboutism. Where are the people complaining about this waste? It’s purpose is purely decorative. For Bitcoin the power is used securing the network and giving jobs. Complain that there aren’t greener forms of generating power anyway. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:07:20
No asset will ever keep going up. 
Anyway maybe I didn’t make my point clear. It already has a use.  As a censorship resistant way to have your own bank. It’s not like ETH which really reason doesn’t have a use at the moment just potential. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:47:22
This is not suppression or prohibition. It’s one guy removing a few posters. And he’s making a statement also. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:06:41
Aw. Poor btrash. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:38:10
Panic-selling is better, I suppose?
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:25:18
Because your gold will be safe from looters.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:39:09
That’s the closest to one.

The Turkish government can print more lira at a whim though.

But still depreciating v Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:44:00
Bitcoin has and still does face a lot of hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty etc. And yet it still blooms. If it were "banned" outright it would just be used by the black market and that's a sizeable market.


No, not everything. And a lot of it would be fuzzy guessing. The supply of Bitcoin makes such estimates easier.
@_date: 2018-08-16 17:57:29
They won't die but they will dwindle away. How many coins in the top ten from 5 years ago are still in it?


The team is more concerned with decentralisation and security, etc at the moment. Anonymity was not built into Bitcoin. But there are efforts to make Bitcoin anonymous. MimbleWimble for example. And there have always been mixing services.
In any case Monero is not 100% anonymous. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:07:00
It’s money. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:08:26
The markets are not really driven by news. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:48:12
Considering they supported s2X at one point, fair play to them.

He's not even a billionaire. Won't release his tax returns anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:48:55
I didn't say that but it still may not be enough. They still have so many hurdles.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:07:06
That's uncalled for.
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:53:44
For the same reason you don't give your kids all the same first name - it leads to confusion.


SEC might have something to say about that.


I use XBT also sometimes, but that's beside the point. I meant at some point the authorities will hopefully sort this out.


It's not explicit though is it?
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:51:41
Then he should have the sense to use his regular account for posts like this.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:49:48
What do you think?
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:45:36
Not significant but not meaningless. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:42:18
Some did. But panic sold. Thought it went up in a straight line. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:15:36
Like this one. At least some are pointing out fraudulent stuff like wrongly listing bch as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:26:43
You or someone (one is not reading the things in context) said gold was better because it was“real”. 
I didn’t say gold was trash.

That was the argument he was making. I shot down other arguments he a few others made. i.e. gold getting its value from use in circuitry.
@_date: 2018-05-06 22:28:10


And, pray, why do I have to? You'd be better to skip the tiresome condescending and make your point. You sound like a bitter refugee from r investing who got into crypto too late.
As I said if they're not scared they're fucking stupid. Whether it's 4 billion 40 billion or 400 billion that's not in their hands.
I've been reading disparaging comments like yours on here for six years. If you don't think Bitcoin or some crypto will not transform finance you're sorrily mistaken.

Who's making up bullshit? I didn't say they were any plans. Spare me your straw man bullshit.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:30:39
No, I don't but I've been in crypto for six years.


That's why they have average and close of day price etc. Anyway, you could argue the other way. Someone bought ETH for ten cents or something last autumn but that did not mean ETH's market cap was obliterated.


All things being equal you could say that about any money or asset. Gold has a trillion dollar market cap but using your logic if everyone decides to sell it all...
My original point still stand. I'm sure the banks are not happy that, to pick even one individual to avoid your obsession with market cap - one the Winklevosses or Tim Draper, say - that his/their assets are not being stored in a bank instead.

You missed where I said "heaps more incompetence".
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:28:22
They probably said that when it went to a dollar.

That's a 24 hour view. 45% now.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:41:03
Market cap is too small. That’s the main reason. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:08:57
Not you obviously. Man up and use your real account - if you have one.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:39:43
Because you have lots of Bitcoins? I think the interface doesn’t matter.

The Winklevoss ETF was rejected last year at $1200. It didn't stop the rise to 20k. The Winklevoss ETF wasn't even the horizon this time.
I think it's because of bearish sentiment this time round.

At least he blamed Gox and not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:08:52
I don't think so.
BCH is not really a fork, it has no chance of becoming accepted as Bitcoin. It's an alt.

@_date: 2018-08-02 19:01:00
Reputations still matter. Some sources are unquestionably more reliable than others. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:11:49
That's more deceptive. On a linear chart a rise from $1 to $30 barely shows up beside a rise from $100 to $1000 and yet the former is a 30x increase, the latter only 10x. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:16:34
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:53:06
You could use both.

I'm talking about last year also (and previous years). BTC is volatile only when there's sudden adoption followed by a crash. Then stability for several months. May to October last year was pretty stable and it's starting to adopt the same pattern now. 
I can see from the down votes I was misunderstood. I said *the* year, not *this* year.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:24:23
Not really. The price would drop when there’s no safe way to guard it. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:14:49
It all depends on when you bought some and if you sold it.

Well, it's hardly mostly seniors buying crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:01:21
You are muddying my original point with straw man tactics. The point is all that value is not in a bank. You're obsessing over how much it is exactly.


So you mean you didn't buy back at 6000 and sell at 11000? 


You honestly think it's going to 2000? Now who's the noob?


If it's in crypto it's not in their possession. Stop being an obtuse cunt.
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:33:42
Hardware one preferably.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:57:07
You have a point. When the price is high there are complaints that Bitcoin is in the hands of the few; when the price is falling many want to get rid of it.

And she has no been made an editor. She’s on the editorial board.

Put your tinfoil hat on. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:51:47
Well, that's why people entrust their BTCs to an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:17:28
So it could go to a 100,000?
@_date: 2018-08-06 04:55:06
An educated person would know what fiat means, at least in the non-financial sense. And downvotes only prove, as I said, that you are not alone. Anyway, it just shows that ignorance is celebrated on here. You thought it was a car, you comment is considered the "best".
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:33:18
It might but who knows? Maybe we hit the bottom.

Some of those apply to putting your Bitcoins into the hands of a third party.

That was not my point.
In any case Bitcoin is more than just a currency.

I doubt there's anything better in crypto.

There will be consequences. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 03:37:26
Bitcoin is volatile because of its tiny market cap. The ruble has no such excuse.

What has that to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:07:34


No, it's not. It's due to its rarity and durability.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:47:39
A legal thing requirement to state that isn't?
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:30:01
Much easier to find. Bitcoin cannot be seized if people don't even know you have it, where you store it and don't know the passphrase.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:12:59
Was that meant for me?
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:52:02
Well, there's definitely some bias involved. My posts were reasonable but are being downvoted.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:42:57
And you suggest launching Bitcoin again? How would that work? And you think thefts wouldn't occur again?
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:23:04
Bitfinex high also.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:32:12
There would have to be consensus and there wasn't so it would be fraudulent selling BCH as Bitcoin.
BCC was Bitconnect so it is an issue. The sooner these tickers are given ISO approved tickers the better.

@_date: 2018-08-06 23:18:15
The difference is there is no good reason (can you give a good one?) to think that car would rise in value and no one would dare to predict that.
Due to its supply and issuance, predictions of Bitcoin hitting tens or hundreds of thousands are common.

That's a lot of ifs and it still might not go to $10.
1) Fatal would have to be an irreparable flaw which seems very unlikely.
2) I don't see how the US or the EU banning would have a vastly worse affect than China's supposed ban.
3) They would likely be private auctions. Wouldn't affect the markets.
4) Doubt that would have any effect at all.

Why is it easier? Which is more ridiculous: thinking that something worth 50 cents will one day be worth $1200 or something worth $450+ will be worth $1,000,000? Both require about the same percentage increase.
In any case, if Bitcoin succeeds it will have to be worth at least 100,000s per unit. How it can it be used for serious transactions otherwise?

And I'm not shoving my opinion down anyone's throat. Although I would prefer that to your panicky comments.

We're not all in the US.

I don't think one can even draw an analogy between Mt Gox and Google. Google is more important to email than Gox is to BTC.

Your dream is to own $450?

One of the first sensible comments I've read on here.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:33:24
Depends on if they have enough fiat to buy more.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:35:01
Read this for perspective. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:55:12
No harm in saving it. Most services who receive btc will convert it immediately to fiat anyway. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 17:06:06
Yeah. Poor little Western Union. Let's not be mean to them. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:49:52
But barely a letter.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:28:15
No, you shouldn't. We need more reliable exchanges of course. Or a decentralized one.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:17:17
Although that's no justification for killing anyone.
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:42:14
Roseanne Bar**r**. Could spell the names right.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:10:23
See the front page. That'll teach the downvoters. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:49:29
Nothing like the analogy he made.
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:33:13
Hardly the hugest.
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:52:30
Trading volume is declining because many are preferring to hold now.


People would have to be willing to sell.


The market cap is still tiny and therefore easily manipulated. Fairly stable at the moment though and was for 5 months last year.
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:15:57
I bought for 180 in April 2013 only to see it rise to 266 and then crash to 60. But I held. Still holding. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:46:29
You really thought it was going to zero? I'd buy them all up at 50 cents.
@_date: 2014-01-31 10:19:47
That's the spirit. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:10:41
$10 I bought in January 2013 still looking good. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:27:42
If you're worried about it supposedly being banned just back it to your desktop computer.

Too much like a bank.

Some disappointingly ill-informed comments from Cary about Apple's relationship with Google.
Google maps licence had expired and Apple (as they have every right to) made Apple maps the default. Google maps app is now in the app store. The part about banning Gmail on the Apple platform is rubbish.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:04:54
Or as a store of value or for sending value abroad. Both more useful than buying a frappucino. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:50:28
As a hedge against inflation? Sure price has dropped but over the long run you might be better off with a few bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:43:18
Andreas Antonopoulos mentioned in a podcast recently that a satoshi could be used as a colored coin to represent ownership of a car. Could it really be just a Satoshi or would it have to be the full price of the car in Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:37:31
She reasons like a 14 year old. Basically says we cannot eliminate Dorian so he's Satoshi and that the whole concept evidence is subjective. The rest is side-stepping and bullshit.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:05:32
We cannot assume it is not him. Not that I care really as long as this Dorian guy is left alone.
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:23:28
If you're buying and holding reasonable amounts. You're doing your part. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:24:19
Like MtGox and other heists/blunders. It's doing well considering.
@_date: 2014-12-23 12:50:49
Speak for yourself.
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:38:11
Unfortunately they usually only do it when the price is skyrocketing.
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:57:29
*farther. Freudian slip?
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:03:39
Not at all. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:10:46
Right now? Last 2 months more like.

How many times has this been posted?
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:32:53
It's valuable because it rare and durable not for the reasons you stated. There are far more useful metals industrially.
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:33:45
Who said it was ready for mainstream use?
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:33:34
You don't have access to one; well that explains it. Stick to what you know.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:28:17
It's little to do with Bitcoin. These wallets are not competitors to Bitcoin. Certainly not directly. Bitcoin's competitors are the likes of Visa and Western Union. And as a replacement for gold.

This guy's a dork.
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:27:24
OK. 10 or 20 upvotes would be enough. I've seen more important stuff ignored.

You mean you bought high and sold low?
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:50:56
And I still think the global warming comment is not comparable E Voorhee's Tweet. Snowing in the US suggests a causation or lack of causation with Global warming. Gox/bitcoin is not linked to the Ukraine situation. Apart from some people supposedly moving their funds Into bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-31 17:30:58
"Asshole" is OK, though?

Thank goodness they're not called Bit- or Coin- something.
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:55:19
It wouldn't need to go mainstream to reach that  price by any means. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:03:59
Good news alone is not enough to make the price rise. People buy when they see the price rising.
Anyway, there's still nervousness over Gox, China, the last big crash, etc. Another bubble is months off.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:39:38
Hopefully this will put an end to some of the misguided sympathy the Newsweek reporter has been getting and remind a few on here of Dorian and his family's plight that she helped to cause.

blockchain.info needs to change the name of the site. Confusion for the uninitiated is understandable.

People selling to make a fast buck. Did you really expect new all time highs? That won't happen for a few months.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:28:02
This is embarrassingly bad from her. Dorian can't be eliminated therefore he's Satoshi and the concept of what is evidence is purely a matter of opinion, she's basically saying. I've heard better reasoning from creationists.

Didn't occur to many it could be the bank that's to blame. Which would be more of a win for Bitcoin actually.
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:30:09
Perhaps some are waiting for it go up in value more before they spend it. 
It is a store of value as well as a currency anyway. Nobody needs to keep spending gold.

And that's why I'm questioning you.

I've read that a good number of them (several hundred thousand) may have been lost.

@_date: 2014-05-15 14:33:03
Bitcoins are not Apples. People who bought Bitcoins for fractions of a cent would think $50 was laughably high. It all depends on how much someone is willing to pay. You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin anyway.

Bitcoin's lost dominance because there are so many coins now. But the chance of them holding value of another 5 years is slim against Bitcoin due to the network effect, Bitcoin acquiring a lot of their functionality and the novelty factor for most of them wearing off.

@_date: 2014-03-15 20:39:13
If there were, say, a 100 million bitcoins they would still need to go up in value to be useful enough for serious use. The limit does not really matter. That there is a limit does admittedly.
The main part you don't seem to understand is that the market cap has to rise to accommodate seriously large transactions and purchases. It's all very well saying no one would buy something with 20 billion dollars worth of bitcoins. At the present, no, of course not. You seem to think the price rises only due to speculation.

You really think a revolutionary internet protocol on which many applications can be built - the first of which is a way to send any amount of money anywhere at anytime to anyone for practically free is less valuable than an iPhone app? Please.

It was a very snarky question directed toward someone who has lost a quarter of a million dollars and came on here to give words of encouragement about the future of Bitcoin. He's spoken many times about Bitcoin at conferences and no doubt has done his part in promoting it.

So they'll just make another fork. You think Visa and others never have problems? Namecoin was found to have a more serious flaw but recovered. Anyway, I can't see another fork driving Bitcoin to $10. Knock a hundred off maybe.
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:40:09
Not sure where you're going with this. 
Your arguments are a bit straw mannish.
I brought up the blockchain to compare how adult and trustworthy the currency is some ways compared to the dollar. 
There's no place in a scientific age for twaddle on banknotes which certain parties latch onto as at least partial justification for religious meddling in legislation.

The question used to be why would anyone spend if the price is going up.

"There's an app for that". Anyway, this appears to be a copyright problem.

It hit 55%?  When? And I don't think the price was affected when it was close to 50 last time.

@_date: 2014-02-28 22:12:32

Nothing to do with trading. You just hold. Those who've had the balls to keep their bitcoins and not panic sell them deserve their reward. Nothing to do with luck also.

On the contrary. Bitcoin is designed to thrive in such conditions. Perhaps not as far as helping the price but in most other respects. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:08:21
Well that's now the task the Bitcoin community has over the next 5-10 years. No one said it is ready for mainstream use.

That's how it felt between May and October last year when it was just going sideways. Wall St will get involved soon. Many predict another bubble June or July.
It has to go up substantially to succeed anyway. How can one, for example, buy something for 20 billion dollars in bitcoins when the market cap is less than half of that?

1- Credit card customers can claim a chargeback up to several weeks. A Bitcoin payment can be instant if the merchant doesn't insist on confirmations - OK if buying coffee for example.
2- With a good long passphrase your wallet should be secure. Apparently a quantum computer can't even crack it if the address was never used to send.


[We also don't hear about the many people whose funds are safe](
3- MtGox's problem was it's too much like conventional financial institutions. Did not stem from a fault inherent in Bitcoin.
4- You may be right but there are escrow services inbuilt in the tech which can be used in the future.
In addition: you seem to be hung up on bitcoin as a currency. It's also a commodity and a store of value, although many here won't want to hear that.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:56:59
I doubt it very much. Why not ban Visa, Square and Paypal while they're at it? 
iMoney's existence is sheer speculation anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:11:45
Takes a few minutes on Circle.
@_date: 2014-05-27 10:23:42
No. Still.
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:46:37
48 % increase in a week is a small price rise?
@_date: 2014-12-02 09:56:13
In your imagination everyone on thinks this way. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:14:06
A transaction is not a purchase per se. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 01:41:15
Fine if you want to spend it soon but for long term saving it's not much good versus gold (or Bitcoin).
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:20:40
If you buy high and sell low, yes you get fucked. Try holding if you don't know what you're doing.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:04:37
Still the place to ask. Front page getting crowded with these "How do I buy" posts. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:12:15
Holding is not trading. Go and tell them it's trading on - they'll laugh you out of the sub.

@_date: 2014-04-26 13:53:33
Something nice and friendly like "Napster"?
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:04:12
It had a better headline.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:31:57
The usual "Oh I won't buy Apple products again" stuff on here. As if that's going to make any difference.
I didn't like the petty sour grapes tone of Blockchain's response. If Apple were just interested in profits why don't they remove PayPal's app and countless other payment apps in the store?
Blame the regulators for creating legal uncertainly in the states and elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:43:35
This is actually good news.

I don't think was talking about a Mad Max scenario merely the collapse of the fiat economy.

Can you give us examples of negative posts that have been down voted unfairly?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:49:55
If you believe in the future of Bitcoin, yes it would appear to be a good time. Buy when there's blood on the streets they say. Although the Bitcoin protocol is as healthy as ever.
Don't spend more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-08-22 14:15:40
No comparison.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:11:37
I don't get it. You're a Bitcoin developer and you just found out about this 51% problem?
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:05:51
Haven't they already?
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:41:26
A million isn't cool. You know what's cool?
@_date: 2014-03-29 13:48:20
I didn't. But I bought at 180 during last April's bubble and after it crashed to 60 I decided to hold. 180 of course now seems cheap.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:01:26
To be fair I just saw him once. But found him hesitant. Maybe he had an off-day.

Yes, it would be "dead" if it plummeted that "low" in 10 years.
@_date: 2014-03-29 13:40:43
Doubtful. It was a bubble. It couldn't be sustained. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:19:44
Don't refer to it all would be better.

Where did he say Bitcoins were better?
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:20:02
Oh, they just lost 100 billion that taxpayers pumped in to bail their asses. That makes it OK then.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:12:08
Blood is too bright but otherwise yes a good job.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:41:30
This is big - the SM Bitcoin Investment Trust, I believe, was the real reason the price took off last fall. Then the Chinese jumped on board.
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:02:01
How was this upvoted?
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:54:23
There is one. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:53:41
Off topic. What's it doing here?
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:29:27


You're a bit naive to think just spending and receiving bitcoins will be enough to increase its value.
I see your account is new. If you're not a newcomer why use a throwaway account?
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:53:13
No harm done.
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:03:50
It's wildly swinging upwards though.
@_date: 2014-10-05 08:38:40
What has the average citizen got to do with it? Does the average citizen buy gold? And we've seen vendor adoption has not helped the price.
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:45:34
I might be wrong, but the Blockchain just needs two networked computers to keep running?
@_date: 2014-11-28 10:37:11

Too much trust of new users as far as I can see. Every "hey I just joined the club and bought my first .00000001 worth of bitcoin" story gets tipped.

And a bitcoin wallet doesn't bitcoins. Just the keys.

That's just the most secure way.

I'm not predicting it. See Wences Casares and others. Anyway $100 was once considered laughable.
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:19:51
I heard all this last May-September. The smart people bought then. Not when the price was confidently rushing past $1000.

@_date: 2014-08-18 17:12:51
It was the same in November. Even more so. This is not the reason for the price drop.

A rise of 270 to 400 is not to be sneezed at.
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:27:58
It's not clear at all that the price was affected substantially by the hearings. It was 900 prior to the **second** day of the hearings. There was a big sell off at 900. Crashed to 500 and then went back up.
My original point stands anyway - the hearings had little effect on the price. They certainly didn't initiate the bubble.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:15:37
Peter Schiff?

Enlighten me, then, if you're so smart.

Well if it went from one cent to $1200 in a few years anything is possible.

They could insist that Bitcoin transfers are transparent. And I don't see how PayPal is different. Not to mention numerous other similar apps that are allowed. Bitcoin wallets are banned probably because of legal/regulatory uncertainty.

Bitcoin is being forced to grow up fast. The arrest last week on money laundering charges of Charlie Shrem, a leading Bitcoin champion, coincided with a regulatory hearing in New York to consider what on earth it is – a virtual currency, speculative asset or a means of exchange?
The best answer is the last, although most excitement has been generated by its wild swings in value and the libertarian promise of a cryptographic currency replacing fiat currencies such as the dollar or the euro. In the end, the old laws affect everyone, including Mr Shrem, who has resigned as vice-chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation.
Payment sounds like the most mundane use for Bitcoin, or other tokens of value, yet it has the biggest potential. It is a challenge to the banking system and may allow the quick and cheap exchange – and transfer of ownership – not only of currencies but also of other assets, goods and services. It fixes a fundamental gap in the internet.
This potential is becoming clear, through the confusion and alarm created by Bitcoin speculation, and criminal uses such as trading drugs on Silk Road, the former online marketplace. Benjamin Lawsky, New York state’s superintendent of financial services, who called the hearing, wants to issue “bitlicences” for virtual currency businesses.
Mr Lawsky is right to create a legal order for virtual transactions, rather than trying to stamp on Bitcoin, as some governments are starting to do. It would be feasible to push Bitcoin and similar initiatives underground but it would also be a wasted opportunity.
The temptation is to dismiss Bitcoin as being weird and easily abused. The fact that its inventor used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and that deals are authenticated by a peer-to-peer network of software “miners”, makes it hard for ordinary people, or regulators, to take seriously.
The other disincentive is that Bitcoin’s most-publicised use, apart from Silk Road trading, is as a spec-ulative asset (the price has risen from less than a dollar in 2009 to about $920 this week). A virtual currency with no central bank backing and no yield is worse than a casino chip.
Look beyond this, however, and Mr Nakamoto’s invention is very useful. He called it “an electronic payment system” and the innovation is that Bitcoin allows one person to hand a token of value to another securely, with no intermediary such as a bank. The deal is authenticated and recorded by the network.
The best way to think of Bitcoin, or other such tokens, is like the data packets that carry information on the internet. They are valued because of what they allow, not for their inherent qualities. Most people do not want Bitcoin but they do want a fast, cheap way to make payments in their own currencies.
People can already use Bitcoin for foreign currency payments in this way, swapping dollars into Bitcoin and out again into euros. Ripple, another peer-to-peer currency network, emphasises such real-world uses rather than the value of its own XRP currency. “The world is not going to adopt a new math-based currency,” says Chris Larsen, Ripple Labs’ chief executive.
Swapping in and out of Bitcoin sounds complex but is less so than a typical foreign exchange transaction via a bank, which passes through correspondent banks, exchanges and clearing houses, all of which are regulated. This adds layers of extra costs compared with a peer-to-peer network.
Payments are also a profitable activity for banks, compared with the risky, capital-intensive business of lending. The average cash flow margin on global transactions was 38 per cent in 2010, according to the International Payments Framework Association, a bank group. It is, in other words, ripe for some peer-to-peer competition.
There are already signs of payments across borders being disrupted. M-Pesa, a mobile payment system developed by Safaricom, the Kenyan operator, was partly inspired by Africans using airtime minutes as a virtual currency. TransferWise, a London start-up, uses an exchange-like mechanism to make low-value currency swaps.
Old-fashioned financial services are thus an obvious target for Bitcoin-like networks. But there could be wider applications in the future, as the technology evolves. Nakamoto’s use of cryptography to assign and transfer ownership of online tokens creates possibilities that reach beyond payments.
One is the idea of “smart contracts”, suggested by Nick Szabo, a computer scientist and former law professor (Mr Szabo is among those suspected of being Mr Nakamoto, which he denies). They would be completed with cryptography – for example, by giving a person who buys a car digital keys.
Another is that people could gain ownership rights to digital goods similar to physical ones – lending or trading them as they want. At the moment companies tend to restrict digital rights to online goods because they are so simple to replicate – one item can be copied millions of times from the original source.
Bitcoin solves this for currencies – it provides a method for the effective transfer of ownership. Once a Bitcoin is handed to someone else, the first holder cannot spend it again. If the same kind of transfer were achieved for other digital items, ownership would be meaningful.
For now, these are possibilities. Fred Wilson, a partner in Union Square Ventures, said last week that virtual currencies reminded him of the internet of the early 1990s and had similar innovative potential. The wild days of Bitcoin should not blind us to what it could become.

It isn't gambling. Crossing the road is gambling in that case. Gambling has a very large element of luck. If you buy at 950 and sell at 1000 where's the luck? Because the price went up? If it didn't then don't sell.

If you're from the future you might know of better times to sell. Hopefully there will be better.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:20:05
How about two years ago?
@_date: 2016-03-28 12:37:47
It's about a certain alt however.
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:05:19
Who gives a shit what they think?
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:17:41
$1000 is meh? Shows how spoilt we've become.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:46:46
Why are you here?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:56:52
Wasting electricity? Troll. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:17:59
China "banning" Bitcoin is unpredictable? The very volatility of Bitcoin makes it easy to trade.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:54:43
Sheep upvoting the top comment. Nothing new on reddit.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:50:53
2014 wants its joke back.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:37:46
Didn't Gox hold people's dollars too?
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:51:15
I meant successful hacks obviously. Not mere attempts.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:44:56
I think they just like the entertainment factor.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:37:28
There has been bad news but the likes of Butterfly Labs and Vault of Satoshi should really have no effect on the price.
@_date: 2016-03-26 13:47:32
They were sent intentionally to an unusable address in exchange for Counterparty XCP coins.
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:06:49
Full of smartarses. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:13:52
If Bitcoin succeeds they're both cheap. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:58:31
It's funny how there's always a bubble a few months after a halving. I don't think the ETF if it even happens would be enough to cause this rise in price. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:31:26
Of course there are risks but it's less dependent on third parties to guard and deliver.
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:15:40
What's this preoccupation with adoption?
@_date: 2015-01-07 09:58:21
Bitcoin withdrawals are not done automatically on Bitstamp. And big ones are done manually. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:53:59
It would be surprising to see the last bubble completely wiped out.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:34:39
You need to work on your punctuation. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:23:26
Not likely the whole of the last bubble will be wiped out.
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:50:46
Aren't you guessing as well that it could go the 100s?
Also, weak hands are just as prone to panic buy. So more than likely they've been selling low and buying high and repeating this all the way down.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:09:15
I thought it was about oil? Not "let's invade just so we can kill innocent people". They could drop a nuke if that was their aim.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:17:52
They could send the price up if they really wanted.
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:09:50
Sell a little. Then you'll want it to drop to buy back in.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:31:47
I take some of Snowden's revelations with a pinch of salt.
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:39:19
To be fair, since there will be only 21 million of them, 1 bitcoin should be worth a lot more than 1 dollar - or even 200 dollars.
edit: typo
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:50:39
Maybe. But it's all relevant. That period was not as nearly as volatile as most.
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:20:13
But doesn't believe in evolution or climate change.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:59:50
That's for trading. They don't necessarily care what the price is. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:10:05
I don't think much of the "flaws" listed.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:45:29
Who said I wasn't being sarcastic?
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:12:01
Why would $50 be overpriced? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:17:45
Apparently shady.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:32:54
Moonguy doing a pump and dump probably. No wonder he got banned on @_date: 2014-05-14 22:54:32
Not just good will. Everyone has something to lose.
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:22:49
Surely it helped to make them famous?
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:16:08
It wouldn't be so volatile with a much larger market cap.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:53:54
Only time will tell. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:42:03
I don't think those I mentioned would consider it overvalued at the moment. Anyway it's not being manipulated now (i.e. by bearwhales)?
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:55:33
Your point being?
@_date: 2016-03-30 08:53:15
Last halving was November 2012. We know what happened in 2013.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:19:35
Fair enough. I hope that's why they're taking their time.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:13:42
Gee. Never saw that coming.
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:55:43
Why not? Looks like no one's trying to kill him. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:16:51
When you believe it won't, it will.
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:57:33
Just need a network of two computers.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:40:08
OP just said he's bullish. How is it a "pump"?
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:04:23
calling it a bubble.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:27:33
[CEO of Xapo.](
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:03:18
In the traditional sense. You could call the blocksize debate a war if you wanted. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:05:39
If you're holding Bitcoins you're supporting the economy. Somebody needs to own some.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:14:16
The Ƀ doesn't read well at small font sizes. And it's ugly. Forget it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:28:52
You think other currencies are not traded?
0? Really? What are doing on this sub?
The ability to send any value over the internet without permission, interference or even anyone knowing gives it value. That and its relative scarcity.
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:36:52
It was a relevant point. You seemed to think utility mattered. It's a very minor reason for gold's value. Gold is valuable because it's scarce and durable.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:46:53
They still screwed up and lost 5 million dollars. Let's not give them a blow job just yet.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:12:48
r/buttcoin needs a suicide hotline. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:24:22
Nobody? Really?
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:40:14
Everyone has the right to refuse the coins though. Or not.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:32:15
Nonsense. Why should merchants accept Bitcoin if no one wants to even hold any?
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:00:15
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:17:32


close.. That's why it gets stolen so often.
You could say that about anything.
@_date: 2017-02-19 18:54:01
Was looking for a pun. I get it now.
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:15:13
That's not why gold is valuable. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:11:08
It's nice if there's a cushion though.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:35:06
It depends on when the bitcoins were bought. Just because they end up being worth $100,000 doesn't mean they cost that much to buy. I think it's a fair bet.
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:30:20
So you've just added to it.
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:48:14
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:36:36
That chart on the right looks ominous.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:26:48
If one is stolen he can at least access the wallet and empty it before the thief does.
@_date: 2016-03-13 01:58:47
No, it's an erection.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:43:28
And how is this Bitcoin's fault?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:17:18
Or not.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:35:07
I wasn't suggesting that gold in vaults is lost, merely that hoarding it is not necessarily deleterious to its value. And the same applies to BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:38:36
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:48:54
They do?
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:17:14
More anonymous.
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:37:21
It's not Bitcoin per se that's to blame.
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:56:50
Never mind the doubters. Good for you.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:21:55


I didn't say that. That's not how charts work.


My logic? Supporters cannot affect the outcome of a game to that extent. That's not what I said at all. I was talking, for example, about taking advantage of nervous noobs panic-selling during a correction. Buying when things look bleak. Selling when everyone thinks it'll go to the moon, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:17:22
Don't put your life savings into an experimental currency.
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:33:08
Surely most will buy coins to get them out? Which would send the price up.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:02:53
It'll be sorted out eventually. I'd rather they made sure the chose the best option carefully without rushing into it. What have DDOS have to do with it? And they're nothing new. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:24:49
And QR codes are? How so?
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:11:00
Relatively high compared to what?
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:18:19
Fucking better.
@_date: 2017-02-14 18:10:39
In G00dAndPl3nty's dreams.
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:28:10
It went from $13 to $260 first, not $1000.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:57:14
Altcoin is short for alternative coin ( i.e. an alternative coin to Bitcoin). I don't know why he's being downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:02:55
There is a wallet on the app store. Not sure how safe it is.
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:07:33
On Kraken.
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:48:39
All it takes is a whale buying 10,000 or so bitcoins to start another bubble. Fraud is not necessary.
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:15:59
Stunning debating skills you have. I'm in awe.
@_date: 2016-01-13 17:17:24
No one expected anything sensational. The comments were as cynical as fuck on here (as usual) after the teaser tweet. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:41:29
Over the internet it does not cost nothing. In fact it's often worth only sending large amounts.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:44:14
If they're bitcoin users they can probably tell the difference.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:04:34
I meant (I prefer) the one with the single bar, as used in the title above. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:16:06
Use an insured exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:24:59
Then every company is incompetent. If they got hacked by that much they're incompetent.
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:42:30
They must think highly enough of Bitcoin to create a sub to denigrate it. Does Litecoin have one?
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:31:13
I thought you were leading up to saying  some coins are more equal than others. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:12:39
How mature is buttcoin? The name itself...
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:56:28
It hovered between 80-110 for weeks. Not terribly volatile by Bitcoin standards.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:26:48
They are all cheap if you plan to sell them again at a higher price.
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:39:35
Which are not enough to warrant its high value.
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:16:44
Even one bitcoin could be enough in theory.
@_date: 2016-03-28 22:06:13
Are you sorry you missed out on the 100,000%+ return on BTC? 
Buterin was sorry he missed out clearly. You can see it in on a YouTube interview where he says it was unfair that he hadn't heard of BTC till 2011. Explains why he created his altcoin. In fact that's the primary reason for the creaion of nearly all Alts - $$$.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:26:35
You do get the impression the whales are trying to snatch up all the cheap coins from weak hands before another bubble.
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:53:07
That's not due just to inflation, though.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:22:47
Transporting and guarding gold is full of logistical difficulties. Reliance on one more other parties necessary. Bitcoin requires little very little space and can be transported without serious cost or time.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:20:14


Where'd you get that figure from? You think the last two bubbles will be wiped out?
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:33:05
Not over several months.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:23:21
And the ruble?
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:20:13
Cue, even. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:37:29
Looks like bullshit. The price is driven mostly by speculation at the moment.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:36:24
I didn't say that. No one's obsessed with gold's adoption. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:27:10
Hopefully no need in the future to convert.
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:40:31
Who said it was ready for mainstream consumers?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:39:38
The market is not driven by news.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:46:32
Why should it be those cryptocurrencies when Bitcoin has a head start? They offer little advantage over it.
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:29:02
Actually, I'm not too confident.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:42:37
The very same people can have cell phones though.
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:23:58
How can it be giving bitcoin a bad name if you've never heard of it? ;-P
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:44:25
Not saying it'll happen but no crazier than 0 to $1200. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:13:50
Level-headed analysis. Will this end up on the front page of r/technology? Will it fuck.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:58:04
Yeah. Fucking lame.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:01:09
Nice piece. There is a typo: "Stockhold-syndrome"
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:31:10
Incredible as in we can can't believe this has happened again.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:39:39
No they didn't. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:56:36
Gox did something similar on at least one occasion. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 12:03:50
Buying altcoins. Don't worry - just tiny amounts. :-)
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:32:18
It was harder in November 2013 to buy bitcoins than it is today. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 09:09:26
Why would it happen so quickly? It would take a month at least.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:18:51
Underpriced at the moment, if anything.
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:43:59
Very communicative? I wouldn't say that. 


Awesome apart from being incompetent enough to lose $5 million?
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:30:28
Falling below the previous ATH may have helped to damage confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value. Why didn't the Winklevoss twins or someone with equally deep pockets step in and buy several thousand XBT before this happened?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:08:21
I doubt it'll go or stay as low as a 100-120. There are plenty of people who bought before the first 2013 bubble who would still be in the black and therefore not prone to panicking.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:32:18
Instant for me.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:36:10
Would they even have a clue what it's about?
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:50:28
They supposedly have no censorship on r/btc but they definitely have an agenda.
@_date: 2016-03-28 23:07:06
I didn't, smartass. I've been on this sub since early 2013. And if your alt is the second coming as many seem to think surely it's still early days?
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:24:05
Joe Average is not going to help Bitcoin take off. He'll be the last to get on board. Anyone seriously into buying Bitcoin will know perfectly well it's divisible.
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:30:47
Not TCP/IP, but:

She's 65. Good luck, asshole. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:55:19
So why not just buy a few million dollars worth?
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:42:42
Likes to be efficient.
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:05:12
What's so dumb about having it in a language most understand?
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:48:33
Like what? If the king of cryptos is vulnerable what chance have the others?
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:28:47
Should change their name to r/ bitcoinclassic.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:22:50
I think they've benefited more from Bitcoin than vice versa.
@_date: 2017-02-02 11:56:26
@_date: 2017-02-20 13:24:12
Maybe you should check the news more regularly for technical developments. Not to mention the price being $100 shy of the all time high.
It's not boring. It's never boring.
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:18:20
But you don't say why.
In any case, gold was been considered valuable long before the advent of electronics.
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:40:15
Going from 1 cent to $30 is about a 300,000% increase. 1,000% is nothing.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:42:26
Remittances is where it's at. Screw the merchants.
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:23:57
It's all FUD in my opinion. Bitcoin will keep running. r/technology is not exactly a bastion of common sense anyway. And since when have they been experts on the block size debates? I've been following Bitcoin for 3-4 years and I don't fully understand it. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:42:30
*3D-printed guns
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:00:28
For normal transfers and payments, yeah.
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:42:35
They banned Bitcoin wallets to be precise.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:43:45
Bitcoin was first. It doesn't have to be the best. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:47:36
Sounder than yours: every company is hacked* so that makes it OK.
*Which is not true anyway - even for Bitcoin ones.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:50:42
Can it be that difficult?
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:35:06
Or even in a book. Hopefully one a thief wouldn't take.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:34:20
There's nothing wrong with holding (i.e. saving)
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:07:25
So now you can buy more even cheaper.
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:14:21
You could skip being emotive and provide me with some reliable links. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:21:51
Is that supposed to be factual/funny?
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:42:55
Mostly its scarcity. Water is infinitely more essential but far too plentiful to be worth much.
By the way, I don't know why you keep down-voting me just because you disagree with me. You know I'll do the same.
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:54:16
Serious currencies he meant surely.
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:47:46
Ignored? It's all we hear of. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:16:54
Like it'll never have problems down the road. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:05:41
At its height though it was 9000%. You should make it clearer in the Infographic. I haven't checked the other figures. That one I knew already.
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:54:58
Based on its usefulness.
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:49:56
If people are willing to pay $1000, then it's real.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:53:18
Thank fuck.
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:13:35
Solid investments indeed. ;-)
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:03:36
No one accepts them though. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:00:44
Well done for not losing our money.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:35:30
Don't confuse Bitcoin with (untrustworthy) services surrounding Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:30:10
But badly-phrased.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:33:14
Rydan being Rydan. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:23:31
Obviously the recipient can cash out if he or she so wishes. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:30:13
Like for example?
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:53:07
I've been on this sub for about 3 years and I don't really understand it.

There are far more useful metals. How many cars, bridges etc. are made of gold?
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:36:49
Circle is quite easy if you've a credit or debit card. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 11:21:22
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:47:54
Perhaps. But it depends on when you bought it.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:40:31
Give me yours if it's worthless.
@_date: 2016-03-24 02:39:01
Not really. It was stable for most of last year. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:13:20
What are doing on this sub? Troll elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:20:36
You can deposit and withdraw in Bitcoin, apparently.
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:18:52
Altcoins being even worse of in that case.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:22:56
Sure. But you don't have to accept it as payment for something.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:28:06
Are you suggesting they are intentionally killing thousands of innocent people in poorer countries?
@_date: 2015-01-07 09:55:28
He didn't say it. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:28:23
Wrong decision. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 13:36:08
It's not controlled by Americans though is it?
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:22:10
Speculators are going nowhere I'm afraid.
@_date: 2015-05-02 07:06:33


Isn't that called having your own car?
@_date: 2015-05-08 03:10:08
Hero worship? Looks like a piss take to me. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:01:18
Surely if it's an old video the issue would've been even more relevant.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:42:08
Act on them how?
@_date: 2016-03-26 13:51:15
Only Hearn left Bitcoin per se though didn't he? And it's "lose".
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:50:11
Short it if you're so sure it's going down.
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:26:46
You can't loan yourself money obviously.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:37:40
One man should not be deciding what happens to the coin. How more centralised can you get?
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:00:05
This creator is irrelevant so let's name this principle after him.
@_date: 2016-01-05 13:55:12


If we're worried about downvotes in some shitty sub.
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:55:34
Apple pay is an interface for a payment system. Bitcoin is a lot more but lacks the snazzy interface as yet.
@_date: 2016-01-13 17:16:21
It was just a tweet. I didn't notice any nationwide campaign. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:22:02
I don't want another ETH/ETC scenario. No thanks.
@_date: 2016-03-29 22:32:10
Don't expect it to go to $600 just because they believe it should be $600. They buy (if they do) when there's a dip.
@_date: 2016-03-30 11:57:03
Whether they are murders is highly debatable. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:51:17
Not a stat that would worry me.
@_date: 2016-03-14 00:37:34
@_date: 2016-03-13 01:59:24
The sub is not that bad.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:55:38
Or spent the same amount on Bitcoin which surely at some point during the same period has gone up $11.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:17:15
Links to bit in the middle but watch the whole talk.
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:08:41
Well, anything could be stolen. How is this pertinent only to Bitcoin? The blockchain itself cannot be hacked in any case.
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:37:42
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:56:37
So what?
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:42:37
@_date: 2014-05-25 23:56:21
Aren't all bubbles "fake"?
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:24:46
He didn't mention money either - in any form. Except for using the term "Swiss bank account". Money/gold are usually better protected than most things. What other expression could he have used?
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:39:55
Yawn. Not a big deal.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:58:35
Better one person is not in control. How more centralised can you get. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:51:19
I never said they should be held indefinitely.
I'm not against spending either, but there's a certain mentality on the sub that thinks buying and selling stuff with bitcoin is all that matters.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:33:18
Just let us log in and trade already. Worst timing.
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:14:36
First bought around $15. Too few though.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:23:52
It has its own sub for this. I think everyone is tired of this alt being spammed and shilled on here especially the rash of PMs many received trying to pump it.
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:09:17
bitcoin.org is one of the first pages if you search for bitcoin because bitcoin(.org) is in the url.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:15:29
Vendor starts accepting bitcoins because he wants bitcoins and not just more business. Makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-10 19:20:30
Who said it was ready?
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:58:14
Just reopen the damn thing. Even a bare bones site.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:47:18
Why shouldn't r/Bitcoin stick up for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:11:24
Not that it really matters much.
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:48:07
And some people really thought this guy was secretly Satoshi? Sounds like a petulant quitter. I'm sure he made a small fortune out of Bitcoin being an early adopter.
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:48:38
You pay for porn?
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:17:39
Their knowledge is bound to be very milk and watery. I doubt most of them understand what Bitcoin is never mind the block size debate. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 13:58:32
Poloniex. It helps if you have Bitcoins to buy them.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:41:27
Just if it happens.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:22:29
Says the day-old Redditor.
@_date: 2016-03-24 20:10:01
Even on the internet?
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:23:47
Or he wasn't patient enough.
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:30:33
When and why?
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:27:29
Especially if the OP was correct.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:37:01
That's not to say it may not continue to rise for a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:43:40
The dollar rise clearly a bubble.
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:55:15
Bitcoin rose 9000% in 2013, didn't it?
@_date: 2016-03-28 15:10:36
Start mining yourself, then. (Assuming you're not in China).
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:38:01
Costs too much to maintain? How?
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:55:17
Big tits not so big. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:19:51


It's not holy scripture, man. Or a manifesto. Stop being so dogmatic - it's software. It has to be updated and improved.
And wrong. Segwit txs are a lot cheaper. Lightning will make them a lot faster.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:19:34
Then make a fake video about it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:00:40
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:11:01
Competition where? Between Core and Classic or Bitcoin and alts?
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:39:54
Or buy now with the expectation that it will be. Or sell now expecting the contrary.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:31:38
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:28:10
Atari is a company/product. You can switch to Sony next or whatever. Moving thousands out of one currency to another is something else. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:03:15
OK. My bad. OP should've kept it simpler though.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:38:38
Competition in what way? Last time I looked they had no coin of their own. More likely it's due to regulatory uncertainty.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:19:39
Have you a source for this?
@_date: 2016-03-30 11:58:02
Try telling r/btc that. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:08:03
Not much good if its blockchain is mutable.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:55:41
Good question. And Bitcoin is far more traceable.
@_date: 2016-03-26 13:54:14


The first two sites are not and never have been popular.
There are now two popular bitcoin subs. How is usage on Reddit declining?
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:31:39
So having more than 21 million coins say should be easy also?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:45:10
Nobody is going to buy bitcoins just to buy something at this stage. Except drugs maybe. More than likely they'll have held them for a while. Long enough probably for their value to have appreciated, greatly in some cases.
As for merchants, Microsoft and others appear to be interested. Remittances and micro-payments are where Bitcoin's strength lies anyway. I really couldn't give a damn about merchants. Credit cards are good enough at the moment.
@_date: 2016-03-28 15:13:21
They were probably alienated by the idiots who were PMing everyone a month ago about a rival coin.
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:28:48
He didn't say that.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:30:48
It went from $13 to $1200 - that's a 9131% increase.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:46:18
He said longterm. And why something an investor said a couple of days ago affect the markets now?
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:41:52
The Bitcoins will still be there when the electricity comes back. It's disappearance a very unlikely event anyway. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:40:53
Merely stillborn.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:09:40
Can they fork unilaterally?
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:50:03
The poll says nothing about spinning off an altcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 12:45:44
Why not X? As in XBT. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:28:46
The fact that most are mentioning the price shows that they are ignoring the fundamentals. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:42:41
It's not a scam though is it? So your point falls apart. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:04:23
Did you watch the video? Anyway, no one really cares about altcoins no matter how supposedly superior. They're mostly pumped by late-comers to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:10:43
There'll probably be services to handle this type of thing. Some people will never be ready to be their own bank - at least not with large amounts.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:56:31
Hearn is so passionate he's given up. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 23:21:11
Compared to the others as good as.

Ooh. Bitter. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 15:44:41
I tried to send them my passport photo once, encrypted, to re-verify my account. We/they couldn't get gpg/pgp to work so I eventually had to email it unencrypted.

Apple use open source software also.

Doesn't Reddit frown on "Brea" in a title?
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:23:40
Traders often sell when things look good.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:26:47
Most of these things mentioned are online attacks. They would not affect Bitcoins in cold storage - the thing most analogous to gold in a vault.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:38:49
Whatever people are willing to pay. Considering there are only 13 million $50 does not seem like much though.
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:16:06
You've been quiet lately I noticed.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:39:30
Electronics industry is not enough to give gold anywhere near the value it has. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:14:43
It was not good. ETH users are happy enough at the moment but what if ETC siphons off more of ETH's market cap? In addition they're not happy with the name Ethereum Classic. Also rolling back theDAO theft nullified the whole idea of the immutability and autonomy of smart contracts.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:47:05
They're an impatient crowd.
@_date: 2016-03-29 23:06:47
Again, you don't know that. It could be at $350 if it weren't for them. Or perhaps they haven't bought a single satoshi. Who knows?
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:12:01
You believe what a government tells you?
@_date: 2017-02-08 11:28:54

Saving it is using it.

All the competent exchanges use workarounds. The Silk Road coins might have been taken by the site's admins - it hasn't been made clear yet.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:43:21
What are these facts?
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:03:28
You introduced the $3000 shit. $13 to $1200 is a 9000% increase. Stop being an ass.
@_date: 2014-05-07 23:33:20
I see no mention of removing an app remotely from an iPhone. Looks like it's about removing apps from the store (which we know they do).
As I said, I still have my copy of the Blockchain app on my iPhone (no one's explained to me why mine is intact while the OP's was supposedly removed).
If you want to be uber-cautious you can always back up the app to a PC and put it on a USB drive.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:45:12
Don't put words in my mouth.
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:20:11
It's not clear he was talking about crytocurrencies at all. Has anyone read the article? He was referring to the security used on phones to prevent access.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:52:34
Whales scaring the weak hands.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:47:03


You sound like you know the reason.
@_date: 2016-01-26 12:31:25
The masses (i.e. the laggards) will come after Bitcoin is successful. They will not make it successful. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:44:45
I'd be happy if a few billionaires interested   
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:15:08
That would be thieves and terrorists, surely?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:43:00
You think it'll never go higher than this again?  But if you have enough money/profit sell some. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 20:37:54
Joe Bloggs didn't know once that you didn't have to send letters. Give it time.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:32:10
Even the Ethereum crowd say ETH is there to compliment BTC not replace it. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 03:12:57
Have you built one?
@_date: 2016-03-27 18:20:58
2013, no?
@_date: 2016-01-01 19:21:43
Bitcoin has to or it won't be much use.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:28:47
There should be cap on these kind of users.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:18:58
Why must a joke always be top? We get enough of that on other subs.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:47:49
As long you praise Ethereum and Classic you're safe there. Relax.
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:48:36
I wasn't asking you.
@_date: 2016-01-10 01:01:17
No, this story about Cryptsy. Are you a native speaker of English? :-P
@_date: 2016-03-28 18:08:16
You're right. My bad. The spammers had no guarantee the price would rise however. Indeed the spamming and posts about spamming no doubt contributed to awareness.
@_date: 2016-03-30 12:24:16
I don't deny some innocents are killed, but morally there's a big difference between intentionally bombing civilians and ones killed in so-called collateral damage. I'm sure Obama, whatever his faults, is not bent on doing the former. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:27:49
Don't keep all your money in it though. It's still an experiment.
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:14:34
It doesn't matter what it says. They're indebted to Bitcoin. This gives Bitcoin even more credibility.
@_date: 2016-01-03 06:08:28
Can't you use a Bitcoin debit card?
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:30:00
So why cause all this shit? Perhaps he can make more money with insider trading. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:48:32
There's no election or referendum here.
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:55:39
Well, they would say that, wouldn't they? They want things their way.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:51:08


Uh, not it's not. 


That's fine if the price keeps going up long term. A savvy trader can easily make money trading in the market and it doesn't require luck or crystal balls, just an ability to read charts and some knowledge of mass psychology. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 12:25:07
Leave this shit for Facebook. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:18:39
A democratic decision is not prudent for this type of matter. I'd rather a handful of very smart people resolved it.
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:14:52
Why the tag?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:06:30
Ethereum has too many points of failure. It's trying to do too much. Also their all too mutable blockchain is not conducive to smart contracts.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:05:01
Like theDAO you mean?
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:09:13
If it survived MtGox it can survive this easily.
@_date: 2016-03-31 23:14:03
Greenwald is an asshat. 
Maybe you should more. Or read less tripe. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:47:41
Certainly applies to r/technology re:Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:29:40
On the other hand now may be a good time to buy, not when things are looking great.
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:49:09
Bitcoin will be quite unrecognisable then probably but still be called Bitcoin. Don't expect it to stand still. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:16:47
And so?
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:28:41
I'd wait a bit longer. It *could* go to 800-1000 due to this BU FUD/alt hype.
i.e. for no good reason.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:44:30
Doesn't mean they are right.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:11:43
Just misery over there as far as I can see. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 15:08:11
I said originally 9000% or something. Don't nitpick. It was about 9000% on the average exchange not just local bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:17:15
The status quo. Transactions may be busy but secure as fuck.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:53:29


This won't affect the price.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:53:08
Over 700,000 Bitcoins were stolen from Mt Gox - then the most popular exchange. It was no small matter. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:30:51
You make it sound reasonable. A bad implementation of them.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:03:30
It's a debate not a war. It will be resolved by hook or by crook.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:23:48
So they don't know what the plans are. Even worse.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:17:31
It hit the ATH today let's not forget.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:39:39
It's pretty tame compared to some subs.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:46:21
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:18:03
Because it was faked?
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:22:04
Didn't it go up 9000% or something that year?
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:47:06
You're the damned fool - can't admit you were wrong. You're bending over backwards to prove otherwise.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:14:37


Satoshi is gone. We shouldn't second guess him.
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:32:31
A blockbuster movie isn't cool. You know what's cool? A franchise.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:32:18
There should really be need for one currency though. We have enough trouble converting fiat currencies. Why replicate that?
Most if not all alts are money-making schemes. Their capabilities could be added to Bitcoin with sidechains or whatever.
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:05:31
I bought first about that price too. So? And what's significantly different?
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:40:37
He didn't renounce Bitcoin though. And there's no certainty he has quit.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:56:38
Bitstamp hit 1350 also.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:47:25
It was much cheaper to mine when it was $2 a coin.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:23:55
How is it a personal attack? I've named no names. Core has far more and better developers. The other side are not content with the status quo and are a ragbag. I suggest they start their own coin. But of course they know it would never take off due to network effects.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:04:26
Well, the original comparison was with gold. Gold has third party issues also.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:39:11


You're only here a month.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:49:22
Great band.
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:07:30
The black market will use it if necessary. That's a multi-billion dollar industry.
@_date: 2016-03-13 14:07:15
That sounds contradictory. Surely disagreement means there is more decentralisation.

Your BU friends won't help you. A ragtag of developers. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:10:40
I need a summary of this summary.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:56:47
The counter-flippening!

Skip the nasty ad hominems and just make an argument.
Would it help if I called you a clueless shill?
[Supposedly the hard-fork was a decision by ‘community consensus’, even though voting on the issue only occurred during a 12 day window, during which owners of less than 6% of the Ether in circulation actually cast a vote.](
If many were happy ETC would not be thriving now.

Monero is more deserving. Dash basically a clone.
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:13:26
How likely though is it that he would pay that much?
As for your point about selling 100k coins - you could just as easily ask what if someone bought 100k coins? Or 1,000,000 coins?
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:43:05
I'm sure they couldn't shit about that. It's all about money.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:16:30
That was a great trading opportunity. Wish I'd had more coins on my exchange.

Well, read the story above for starters.

Unlikely. But even if it happens nothing to stop ETH being flipped.

Not me. The whales will I bet. Then buy back in.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:17:58
It's only a possibility. It probably won't happen.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:03:58


Arguably proves my point. Email also might not have a future.


It's more transportable and store and harder to forge, easier to assay.


Not sure I understand. Then surely it's better to hold?
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:10:48
Try doing so over the internet. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:19:38
And it's because their currency has gone down the shitter so why shouldn't they worry about their assets?
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:45:03
I see! Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:08:36
That ends well.

He did it without a middle man.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:02:43

You specified a period of time. My comment was relevant. Now fuck off.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:12:38
Holding it is using it.
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:51:03
Some will still complain it's difficult to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-01-09 23:40:01
And the site is still running. Is this much ado about, as is the wont on here?
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:17:11
Mt Gox didn't have the highest standards. 
Gox's price was pretty much imaginary. 
Also the dollar is much stronger today than then. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:39:50
Bitcoin has the network effect and greater security. With RSK why need ETH?
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:56:15
If you bought at 10 cents it might be.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:32:41
That's not a source. And seizing control makes it sound like they infiltrated the premises. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:05:19
Pointless might be a better adjective. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:24:56
Because they don't know what they're doing.

@_date: 2017-03-26 04:02:31
Why does he assume the people clapping haven't made up their own minds? Enough of this political correctness and giving BU the benefit of the doubt. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:54:01
Presumably nothing illegal happened. The market cap is currently so small it's susceptible to this type of thing.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:33:36
That's an android surely.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:08:33

@_date: 2017-03-17 18:26:34
It'll be considered an altcoin. How is that a win?
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:35:50
I think the other side want alternative bitcoins. Period.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:48:18

You have a source for this?
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:47:14
Where did he say take it down? He said trolls attack the community.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:28:53
...to stop BU.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:58:44
He defended Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:11:21
We shouldn't try to second guess Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:48:48
The last one of course. A future halving would have little if any effect.
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:36:37
After seeing the spurious comparisons with these in the post about ATMs with $3 fees: These are for buying Bitcoin. Not withdrawing. Buying. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:26:14
Don’t tell me they don’t get a cut. Yes. This is the thing. It’s to withdraw a physical item. Rather unnecessary item in a digital world. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 05:43:58
If Bitcoin were just a (standard) currency you might be right but it is also a store of value and a payment network and a hedge against inflation and a digital offshore account and a personal Swiss account - a money free from government meddling. 
It is being used for all of the above reasons. If it were just another currency it wouldn’t stand a chance as no one is forced to use it unlike fiat currencies - where spending is encouraged and saving discouraged because the powers-that-be just want rampant consumerism. And fuck our future selves. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:29:51
That's the argument I heard against Hillary and Trump.

@_date: 2017-03-18 12:10:56
Exactly.

It did not coincide with ETH rise.

The volatility is due a small market cap. It's not intrinsic to Bitcoin. At times it has been more stable than gold.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:09:02
Not to mention the contentious hard fork to get back the Dao funds which questioned the validity of having smart contracts at all.

You mean against talk about altcoins - like the proposed BU one.
@_date: 2019-03-25 00:59:42


The ransomers wanted to be paid in Bitcoin and yet waiters are shunning it? Those ransomers wanted it because it's desirable. I don't see how Bitcoin is in any way to blame. You can buy drugs with cash then use a note to snort coke. And later launder the money. HSBC and other banks have been caught doing the latter.


Elsewhere in this thread I posted it's the same as the people who leave religious tracts as tips. Their heart is in the right place, but it doesn't do anybody any good.
Forcing people to use a crypto to get the fiat money that they currently need in their pocket negatively affects the crypto, the worker, and the community as a whole.
A tip is going to pay the rent? You can use it for other things.
You can buy "real money" (i.e. worthless paper) with no backing or supply limit with this "fun money".
Religion is belief in something for which there is no evidence. This guy was giving an optional tip in the hope of introducing someone to a money that is not controlled or mis-controlled by the government.
Forcing people to use a crypto? Haha. That's a good one. No one is forced to use crypto. And yet many want it. People are however forced to use fiat currencies by their respective governments who have decreed it has value.

Great. But why is this worthy of the front page?
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:33:25
Ethereum is mostly hype with a mutable blockchain. It may go up in price but the idea of a world computer is a pipe dream and unworkable.
Anyway, why not hedge your bets?
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:21:34
Theymos always said Classic/XT/Unlimited was an altcoin. Looks like he'll be right.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:25:57
That was yesterday. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:58:01
They are certainly not coy about it. It's something it's better not to remind people of.
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:52:11
Most of them don’t hold gold either. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:34:06
It's still there. Although two laptops with an network connection could keep it running, I believe.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:45:57
Why do we have to be united? Surely that's the antithesis of decentralization?
If you know about ETC then you know it has siphoned off part of ETH's network effect and market cap.
This is not a good thing.

You got a link?
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:37:55
The only thing censored on here is altcoin talk - which now is clearly what the other side want, an altcoin.


So why did he clearly model it on gold? Miners, limited supply etc.
In any case sticking to a supposedly original idea is dogmatic and stagnant. Let Satoshi return if he wants to enforce it. Also you're ignoring segwit and LN.


BU are a bungling crowd with naive ideas and little code of any value.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:51:39
Technological tour de force sounds better.

They won't manage anywhere near enough transactions.
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:09:46
I know because it's more of a monetary thing than it is technology. Gold is very low tech but is *the* store of value. There's a massive incentive to keep Bitcoin at the top. If Bitcoin is replaced what is to stop the usurper also being replaced? We can never have sound digital money at that rate.
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:25:37
A little moderation is a good thing. Some people can't conduct themselves in a debate unfortunately.

I've already addressed this over and over. It doesn't matter if the tech is similar. It doesn't have Bitcoin's pedigree, infrastructure, network effect etc etc.
The man on the street is genetically almost identical to Mozart and Einstein. Is he on the same level? 


You're confusing divisibility with supply. If you could buy things with gold atoms it wouldn't mean there's more gold now.
As for your Citcoin, I could argue the contrary and with better reasons why do we need it if we have Bitcoin?
Another problem with the alts is they are too centralised. Once people saw Bitcoin worked and accrued value developers started to launch their own coins and couldn't help having control over them. Only Bitcoin started in the fairest way possible. It took it years to get to a dollar. A new shitcoin can do that in a few days with enough hype. So most are basically scams to enrich their creators.

That’s not begging, silly. Are you paying attention?
@_date: 2019-03-30 17:25:51
You're the one who is fucking dumb, my friend. Or at least very naive.
You and many others have gotten it into their heads that Bitcoin is just a currency. You do know it it is a payment network also? And a decentralised one free from government control, no fear of seizure or  blocking of transactions. With an issuance rate that has fixed and deflationary. These are the things that give it value. Not being able to buy groceries with it. Why would that give it value? Vendors should desire it first for itself.
First I was just making a point that something can have value without being a (good) currency. Cars are valuable because they cost a lot to develop and make and they are very useful. You could use a car to buy something but it would have to be of equivalent value. It's not really divisible. You could tear it apart I suppose. Bitcoin is divisible up to 2.1 quadrillion units. Even gold is not that divisible unless you want to fool round with atoms.


So you admit it can be used as a basic currency? Shooting yourself in the foot there.
Gold has other uses yes but these are not really monetary and add little to its value relatively speaking.
It's valuable because it's rare and doesn't corrode. Most of it is being "hodled".

They are not identical in every other way. And copies are not accepted in the same way. You just refuse to accept this fact. Other examples are stamps or comic books. Originals of these can be worth millions; excellent copies a few dollars. Copies no matter how good will never be worth the same. Bitcoin is top not just for tech reasons. The reasons are also monetary. You create a Bitcoin clone and see if you can get .0000004 cents for it never mind $4000.

Why do you think Bitcoin should be widely accepted when no fiat currency is? Can you spend Euros in the US? Or dollars in Europe?
Furthermore no one is coerced into using Bitcoin as we are with fiat currencies. And yet people use it. At least as a long term store of value.
As for volatility it's only to be expected in an asset with such a relatively tiny market cap. The volatility is not inherent to Bitcoin. It's bought and sold - as gold for example is.
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:21:34

It wouldn’t be a convincing argument. Few were using Segwit and the UASF caused more panic than excitement. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:55:19
It should have never have to 20k. You can blame that on get rich quick fools. But why has it dropped? Is it because the supply has been diluted like the dollar or because the aforementioned fools have sold? In other words it isn’t Bitcoin’s fault. The volatility is not intrinsic to Bitcoin. It’s a market thing. 
However long term the trend is clearly upwards as is evinced by BTCUSD rising several million per cent in its ten years.

Disagree. Has been working non-stop for 9-10 years non-stop. You're missing the importance of decentralisation. The security. Don't get hung up on 10 minute tx times etc.


You mean the alts? They are not Bitcoin. You can replicate Rembrandt paintings but that doesn't make them Rembrandts. Bitcoin is the only crypto that was initiated in the fairest way possible. All the alts are too centralised and basically scams to enrich their creators. It took Bitcoin a few years to get to one dollar. Case in point: a shitcoin with some hype can go from 0 to one dollar or beyond in a day, or hours even.
In any case you argue the opposite: why use alts when you can use the vastly more secure Bitcoin?


How can you not use it? To buy stuff? Can you pay with Euros in the US? OR with gold anywhere? Why do you assume Bitcoin, without being forced by a government, as fiat is, should be accepted everywhere?


Hm, better.. Yes, pieces of paper which can be printed at a whim. It's only better for the governments as they can hold onto the gold while we have to be content with IOUs.

@_date: 2019-03-30 23:27:14


Are you saying Bitcoin has value because others believe it has? It has value because it's scarce and useful. It doesn't matter if the scarcity was artificial to begin with - the supply is irrevocably fixed now.
It doesn't have be efficient so far as speed goes (if that's what you meant) second layers can handle that.
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:21:22

And yeah. The only reason the dollar is accepted is because it’s foisted on everyone.

You think the miners or exchanges should be a charitable organizations? Come on.
Anyway, if you're taking Bitcoins from your wallet obviously it is 0. You don't need an ATM since Bitcoins are not physical.

I'll come back to this post in a few years when one would hope Bitcoin is up substantially and ram this not so little tip down their throats.
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:51:22
So how is Bitcoin up several million per cent since its inception?
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:31:58
Because they want to stimulate industry and commerce.
How is the warm body going to lop off a 50 cent piece of gold from his nugget to buy a newspaper? And how will the vendor be sure it's real gold?


No, it's not. It's certainly not replicable. (I hope you don't mean the fool's gold of bcash and others.) Nakamoto's genius was introducing digital scarcity.
Gold needs electricity/systems etc. to be stored, guarded, transported etc. And usually in the hands of a third party.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:06:48
But gold is not that volatile. And neither will Bitcoin be when the market cap is big enough and it cannot be swayed by whales or buying frenzies. Have you notice how stable it can be once it reaches some sort of bottom?
I don't think that's the reason gold is not used as a currency anyway. The governments prefer to keep the gold for themselves and fob off the public with paper and inferior metals.

It’s far lower though. And technically there’s nothing stop it from being higher. 
And what is the good reason you allude to? Surely it’s sound money. It has many of the characteristics of gold. Don’t tell me vendor adoption is not high. I couldn’t care less about that.

This is how Bitcoin works. You’re naive if you think everyone will adopt it otherwise. It’s not legal tender or pushed onto the public. Its deflationary aspect is what draws people in.

So post your credit card details here. Something easily accessible when you hand a vendor your card.
The private key of your bitcoins is never revealed. 


Just a not so simple matter of getting the key. If you use a trezor no one is defrauding you.
And your mental if you think a card with all your details is more secure than say a trezor or even a good phone wallet.
Stop apologizing for an archaic system.

It's not absurd. Why accept it instead of fiat? It's not legal tender, no one is forced to use it. You should only accept Bitcoin if you want Bitcoin for itself - at least until the day comes when many have it and it's an inconvenience to the vendor not to accept it.

@_date: 2019-03-17 01:44:32
Last ten years says otherwise. The dollar has in fact fallen several million per cent vs Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 17:02:46
Seems to be running ok. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:38:01
You can use it as a hedge. Electricity won't be gone forever.
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:16:07


I couldn't give a damn about it's supposed reputation. Although this is 2019 not 2013. It's featured regularly on serious financial media. There is Bakkt, hedge funds and ETF submissions. Silk road is history. People know Bitcoin is neutral.
Supposed impracticality will not stop someone trying to get something worthwhile.


A $50 tip? Ah so if the price is high enough the trouble is worth it. They won't care if they don't value it anyway. There is a market price. A joe could find an old trinket worth a bit of money but not care for it himself. But he'll value it because others do.


I think you underestimate the intelligence of the average person. And as for people who work for tips having more important things to do than learn about crypto I beg to differ. It might open their eyes to economics and finance. And realise we don't need to use a government to tell us what has value while they sit on their gold.


You've got all kinds of platitudes, many of the laudable, but you fail to grasp the problem that slipping crypto into a tip jar does more harm that good, and can add one more problem to the lives of people who have enough already.
They can sell it for fiat. They're not forced to use it. And why are you downvoting me if some of my platitudes are laudable?
@_date: 2019-03-30 01:17:21
Has it ever?
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:12:10


All the more reason to have Bitcoin. Piracy of software and media is illegal too but they are powerless to stop it.
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:54:56
[No, banks will not necessarily reimburse you if you get hacked, a favourite defence of the fiat-heads.](
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:23:32
Because it’s controlled artificially? Although it hasn’t stopped it falling several million per cent vs Bitcoin since 2009. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 04:07:25
For the same reason he calls bcash Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:11:22
The US president gets away with it.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:01:07
Why does there have to be news?
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:37:35
Shitcoins/alts are fiat basically. An attempt to print more money.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:19:48
If you have enough fiat in reserve you should welcome the drop.
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:57:50
@_date: 2019-03-26 05:30:34
Only Newsweek.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:09:19
I couldn't give a damn about the dollar. And the dollar wouldn't have to fail for Bitcoin to go to a million anyway.
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:24:58
Tone Vays said he was short term bullish before this rise. So clearly not everybody.
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:53:52
Fiat is a scam.
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:25:11


Then why are you making a big deal about it?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:40:42
It is, apparently.
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:33:00
Unfortunately you're a fossil.
@_date: 2019-11-09 01:09:53
All the more reason to own some.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:02:40


Switching between them or even keeping several accounts cost nothing and was risk free. Not a true analogy.
@_date: 2019-03-09 03:41:10


I meant just like a literal fork in a road. Not backwards compatible in this case. Also calling them forks gives them sort of undeserved validity.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:01:04
You resort to violence?
@_date: 2019-11-01 15:34:23
I'd still give it a couple of weeks to be fair.
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:47:06


Because better it's one no one wants to hoard.


Come on. Clutching at straws now. You know gold is nowhere near sufficiently divisible or verifiable. Bitcoin is leagues ahead in this respect.


What has this to do what we are talking about? You can lose keys to anything. And lost Bitcoins means a lower supply anyway.


It won't be accepted as Bitcoin - anymore than a perfect replica of a Rembrandt will be accepted as a real Rembrandt. And Bitcoin will be infinitely easier to verify than the replica or forgery.
Gold certainly needs third parties for serious amounts at least and this is its biggest problem. Not your keys not your gold. Ask Venezuela.
@_date: 2016-06-19 10:53:41
Even the ETH devs say it's not really a currency.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:06:05
I was polite. Fuck you.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:58:11
That's what she said.
@_date: 2016-06-12 07:58:37
No. Wait for a dip. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:43:06


That's beside the point. You're going off on a tangent. My point was that a copy does not give it the same validity. A Bitcoin clone does not make another Bitcoin.


They won't find it. Or even know you have it. And if it's a hardware wallet or protected with multisig? Good luck.
Apart from fungibility (at the moment) Bitcoin trumps gold in every respect.
@_date: 2019-03-19 02:16:10
Yes, and they are as bad as banks. 
If only we had a way to store value without a third party... Oh wait...
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:18:25
Are you defending it? It sounds like it. 
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:42:18
It's pseudonymous.
@_date: 2019-03-27 02:48:13
In some way, but theoretically bitcoin could be used instead of fiat.
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:21:07
Satellite has been used for Lightning.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:46:12
Like they're a bastion of fairness.
@_date: 2019-03-17 17:48:20
With Bitcoin you are your own bank.
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:39:48
Only by buying a hell of a lot. News won’t do it. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:20:06
I used to live in London. I never saw anywhere accept Euros or dollars. Maybe street vendors. But then they could just as easily accept Bitcoin. And certainly no one accepted gold (something you evaded). 
It’s not doing nothing sitting in a wallet. Holders bolster the economy and are rewarded by Bitcoin being a hedge against inflation or even economic collapse. It’s use as currency will come when everyone desires it for itself and not just accepts it as an alternative. A larger market cap will make it more stable. 
Anyway why do you take it for granted Bitcoin should be accepted internationally when no currency is? Also Bitcoin has to contend with not being legal tender and not being required by law in  each country.  It has a lot to fight against. I don’t consider vendor acceptance as a criteria in any case  as to whether it’s a currency or not. 
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:44:25
They might be more likely to tolerate Bitcoin to avoid anonymous networks.
Of course Monero's more centralized. Every alt is.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:13:58
I know it’s also the baht symbol but who outside Thailand uses that? The dollar sign is used for other currencies anyway. It would be obvious in the context that it’s for Bitcoin. 
Kraken are foolish if so. Can only lead to confusion. 
And certainly no one uses Ƀ. 
@_date: 2019-11-27 23:02:42
So you're a shit trader. :-P
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:43:02
As others said, there should be enough denominations. The decimal point can be moved if need be, with a soft fork I think.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:21:21
Screw the merchants.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:34:01
I think he meant core.

The rally began well before the ETF was in people's minds.

OK, boomer. Good to see the cypherpunk spirit is alive and well.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:56:01
Not sure that is so. Those bitcoins had to be bought - money was still introduced into the bitcoinosphere.

It can be volatile. Hodl.
@_date: 2016-06-12 08:02:08
Assuming he doesn't day trade. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:46:17
We’ve never seen anything like Bitcoin before. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:27:16
No, let's gang up and fork BU.
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:44:57
You'd have this problem even with a foreign reserve currency. Or with gold.
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:52:31
@_date: 2016-06-18 10:24:52
The problem is not the DAO so much as how they're planning to rectify this fiasco by hard forking.
@_date: 2016-06-01 04:57:02
You want us to hug and kiss them or give them actual information?
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:54:46
What is false?
@_date: 2019-03-18 06:51:05
So you’re talking ATMs in stores. Well, it doesn’t matter. Someone is pocketing the big fees. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 05:25:20
2015 went to about 165.
edit: wrong year
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:40:04
More centralized. And more likely to be banned outright.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:39:12
Cool. But not that it matters. Bitcoin has bigger burgers to fry.
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:02:06
Bitcoin will remain volatile as it siphons off value from rival assets. That’s the only way it can grow financially. With a big enough market cap the volatility will diminish. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:37:08
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:47:20
So the sanctions are helping?
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:19:44
They also don't accept foreign currency. Is that funny money?
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:15:57
Yeah. They want people to spend. Not save. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:47:44
That's a problem for developers and UI designers. It's not unique to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-08 14:02:03
Heh. He's not too bright. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:35:43
Think Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction.
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:22:44
That must have been during a crash.
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:04:33
That's the point.
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:05:43
$0.003 is the first recorded price.
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:10:02
It’s actually billions and billions.
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:29:43
So you’re saying paying for proof of work is what gives Bitcoin value?
You only have to look at the ten year chart to see that the value of the dollar is down severely in relation to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:03:21
Even from one dollar it's up about 400,000%
And starting from zero anyway and going to $1 or $20K is nothing to sneeze at.
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:05:18
Why? One man shouldn't have the last word.
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:17:00
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:02:04
Since the early 1930s really.
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:21:16
I'm not talking about the technology so much as the developers' integrity.
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:44:03
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:50:44
Sorry, just deleted my comment before you answered because I decided to respond above instead.
@_date: 2019-03-25 02:32:58
There's precedence, although this had a key in it apparently and Bitcoin was $13,000 then.
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:05:16
Any profit is a good thing. You can always buy more later.
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:24:31
Please. I don’t care. We’re more interested in making things better for the public. Not a handful of vendors. ATMs are still needed only because cash is physical. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 15:35:48


Yeah. At money exchanges. 
I mentioned gold because you seem to think vendor acceptance is what gives something value. 
There’s no question Bitcoin was modeled on gold anyway. Satoshi even mentions gold mining in the white paper. 
Dude, Bitcoin doesn’t have to do anything to rise in value. Inflation alone can do the job. An immutably limited and deflationary supply guarantees that. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:00:12
You hold the coins yourself. Mind you, I use Bitstamp and they certainly don’t charge $3 or anywhere near it for a withdrawal. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:58:37
This implies 100%. All 7 year olds are too short. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 05:36:47
But then it would probably end up like alts. Too centralized. And therefore fail.
@_date: 2019-11-02 05:16:19
So DCA $50 a week until 2030.
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:50:28


Pre-mined and not censorship resistant (theDAO). Centralized. Also now not even scalable (ETH 2 now needed). Many broken promises or delays. No real monetary policy. More buzzwords than anything else.
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:47:59
He's admitted to owning some ETH though. So he's not completely unaffected.
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:23:36
I doubt it was many or it would have kept rising.
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:40:53
But you bought at 14k :-P
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:07:09
And why not use a banker or politician in the rain not some nice lady (who doesn't appear to be one of them)?
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:47:32
What if you use multisig or timelock?
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:24:50
On Reddit. Late 2012.
@_date: 2019-03-19 16:12:02
Then you’re not paying attention to what I’m saying. You even say yourself crypto will make this all redundant. Cash should not be needed. It belongs in the era of physical music recordings. 
They’re running at a loss? So they’re incompetent as well. Fuck them. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:11:20
Bitcoin too is rare. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:19:20
Ethereum has its politics too. Ethereum Classic and the debacle over the hard fork to retrieve the DAO stolen money.
@_date: 2019-03-14 00:30:36
Within 5-7 years one would hope.
@_date: 2019-11-16 19:17:27
Is Monero even 100% anonymous? I've heard the contrary.
@_date: 2016-01-01 13:27:12
People being people. FTFY

He uses Trump's spell-checker?
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:05:39


Secured by, not backed by. Although what good is the military against Russian nukes?
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:07:33
But Bitcoin is doing that.
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:43:54
He said in his book it was advisable if they did if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 02:10:21
I answered you elsewhere. All alts are centralized.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:25:27
Tell him that.
@_date: 2019-11-07 01:28:35
Only now? They were one of the NYA signatories. The warning signs were there.
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:31:32
No one wil buy Bitcoin for this though. Great for those who own it however.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:16:28
If you were around longer than 3 months you’d know.
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:25:29
Too risky. Even if Bitcoin itself is not hacked can reflect badly on btc. ETH pice tanking now.
@_date: 2016-06-19 10:39:50
He could still be making valid points.
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:29:13
We still have all that.
@_date: 2019-11-17 03:36:52
For the same reason you don’t post pics of cats on a sub for dogs.
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:26:49
If you do you’re a sucker. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:27:29
So cash only? What about online or gold?
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:57:34
I hope you still have some. Some people thought they were lucky selling during the bubbles of 2013. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:21:21
We might down down again before the next bull run.
@_date: 2019-03-24 04:51:14
About what?
I suppose sticking it up his ass is better. Jesus Christ, some people...
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:50:20
Is there a hurry to cash out what is after all an optional tip?
@_date: 2016-06-19 15:13:27
Well, he's anonymous, so it doesn't matter too much.
@_date: 2016-06-12 08:04:10
They wouldn't need this much to buy a few alts. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 11:58:43
It's been around 500 for a few days. It was around 200 for literally months. Few wanted to buy it then but there were plenty of opportunities.
@_date: 2019-03-20 05:22:58
It’s siphoning off value from somewhere. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:55:02
I first bought at 13 dollars. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:06:29
Would they go easy on the schadenfreude?
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:25:53
I notice this story has not been posted to ETH-friendly Censorship?!
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:45:01
Not judging by the first couple of lines. Didn't read the rest.
@_date: 2019-11-11 01:52:37
It was always like this.
@_date: 2019-03-18 17:33:33
Lightning is not centralized. 
And with Segwit the fees will never be as they were in 2017 - if people use Segwit.
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:11:24
What is speculation? The price?  No one knows how much a Bitcoin should be worth. Although compared to other assets the market cap is tiny so the price could be many magnitudes higher. As for whether it’s thriving: look at the volume and transactions. Look at Segwit and Lightning adoption. Look at nodes. Look at projects like Schnorr signatures and Mimblewimble. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:39:58
Keep still, Andreas. You're driving the cameramen mad. :-)
@_date: 2016-06-04 07:07:14
I salute him also. ಠ︵ಠ凸
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:39:21
I like it. Not the first time I’ve seen this suggested though. The bolts in the example could be angled more though. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:43:17
But why? Was it because the supply was changed? Or because get rich quick fools had been buying it throughout 2017 and it couldn't last?
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:32:31
Your source for that? And why trust another government issued money?
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:31:08
So is gold.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:03:56
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:25:30
But Bitcoin is as good as ever. It's psychological.
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:43:22
User name checks out.
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:46:42
The least of its worries. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:38:35
Yes. But it’s convenient. But keep most of your coins in cold storage. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 04:06:00
And they store keys not coins.
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:41:58
More like an AFM. Fishmonger, not teller.

Between 4-6 pm DC time.
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:30:38
The last ten years says Bitcoin is better as a store of value. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:08:17
Someone sold some coins. That was why it fell. 
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:22:17


Then they never understood it.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:20:14
Maybe he hopes to buy more?
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:55:21
Unless you mean a few of the 21M units.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:24:59
And way faster than gold.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:52:17
Then sucker them into thinking certain alts with replace Bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-06-02 08:54:08
Lock them up.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:43:56
He did say something like that, to be fair.
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:38:02
Looks vaguely Neanderthal.
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:01:16
 I love the smell of ~~napalm~~ Bitcoin coffee in the morning.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:22:14
Some think, erroneously I believe, that Tether is used to pump the price of Bitcoin. There are Tether/alt pairing also but it doesn't seem to "help" the alts as much.
@_date: 2016-06-04 07:18:11
Then the big fear was the 51% attack. Whatever happened to that?
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:07:09
That's like complaining it's stormy today on your tropical island. Think long term.
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:43:05
One is held by a third party. If you don't see this distinction it's probably why you don't appreciate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:46:06
You either want Bitcoin or you don't. Anyone who desires it is not wanting to convert it instantly to fiat.

And you ignore my arguments, iamverysmart. The Rembrandt point for example. You started off on the wrong foot by using an ad hominem at the very beginning. You prefer to argue using opinions. So don't tell me who's out of their depth.


It's already superior to gold, fungibility aside.


Recreating doesn't mean shit if it doesn't have consensus, network effect, infrastructure etc.


Meanwhile your precious dollar has fallen several million per cent vs Bitcoin since its inception. Lol.

@_date: 2019-03-18 22:55:32
No, but you expect the miners to work for free. And banks are viciously greedy never mind being charitable. With Bitcoin we don't need to use an ATM. It's always digital. Just withdraw from your Bitcoin wallet. Surely the point of the meme.

They don't have a history of coming back. Bitcoin didn't crash because of a fault inherent in Bitcoin anyway, so these are spurious comparisons.

You present a counter argument or you come across as an adolescent.
Even the Visa network is not as reliable as Bitcoin's. It was down there recently. Bitcoin has been running non-stop for 9-10 years and never been hacked.
I don't deny credit cards are useful but don't tell me with a straight face they are secure or more secure than Bitcoin.

When did you first buy? If you made a profit don't complain.
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:44:15


But not due to screwing around with the supply. It was heavily overbought late 2017.
You can do do whatever you want but a money without a fixed or deflationary supply is not a sound money.

Yes you were. I wasn't talking about using paintings as a money as you implied. 


Again with this? Just as there's nothing unique about a Rembrandt painting supposedly? It can be copied. The problem for you is that there has to be a consensus. These things are valued by people. Rembrandt's are accepted as Rembrandts and Bitcoins are accepted as Bitcoin. Which is why bcash is worth far less and has a puny hash rate and no infrastructure, few trading pairs etc.


If if if. Maybe the sun go become hotter and melt all the gold. /s So holders will become rich. Bitcoin is highly divisible so there's no fear of there not being enough to go around.

I can’t buy toothpaste with it in the corner shop? Who gives a fuck? I wouldn’t anyway. I use fiat because I know it will lose another several thousand per cent in the next 5 years vs Bitcoin. Why? Because the supply cannot be diluted. You people just don’t get it.

Well, obviously people have confidence in Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:58:45
Because they prefer the public to buy goods.
Bitcoin will be a good currency once it has become more proven, with a larger market cap and every vendor desires it for itself and not to convert it to fiat. Gold is desirable but it's too difficult to handle, verify, transfer, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:17:46

@_date: 2016-06-12 21:21:17
You've got it the wrong way around. The price is going up because they're buying.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:20:04
We weren't a few weeks from the halving. And there is no real problem this time. An exchange hasn't been robbed.

Or if the dollar goes down. So you're protecting yourself from inflation. Also your money cannot be seized. Transactions cannot be stopped.
You really think the price going up is all there is to Bitcoin? You would need more than that to get the ball rolling.
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:59:08
You didn't answer my question. Is it the coin starting with N and ending in O? is not a niche sub.
Decentralization is not required for fast or cheap txs. And if txs gave something value Visa would be worth a lot more than gold. Or emails even.
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:08:43


If it happens it's not because of the monetary policy, as in fiat.
It's risky but at least in your own hands.

Really? Credit cards often have a charge for using.
Apple Pay is just an interface. Bitcoin could be used with Apple Pay - or with cards.
In truth, this is not presently where Bitcoin's strengths lie. Rather as safe haven/store of value/hedge.
It may be more expensive (debatable) but it's returns over 9 years are unsurpassed. And it's the deflationary aspect that will cause adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:28:59
I don't understand the question. Are you saying BTCUSD is more likely to fall?

This whole business is a disaster for ETH. ETH itself not hacked but this guy can hold them to ransom which is bad or the devs can hard fork which is bad. If he keeps the coins he can flood the market. If the devs hard fork no one can trust ETH or smart contracts again. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 06:54:50
Or he could have bought 30 dollars worth of Bitcoin in December. It’s the amount you buy not the price that matters.

Lightning is not centralised either. Anyone can run a node. 51% attacks are theoretical at this stage. They would be far too expensive to launch and would not be worth it.


I'm sorry it does matter which came first for the reasons I outlined. It's not just about tech, there are financial reasons. A consensus have agreed that Bitcoin is the crypto standard. The digital gold. You can see bcash and others have failed despite being supposed copies. Floundering around $100 and with puny hashrates. And only have any value at all because they are riding on Bitcoin's coattails.


If you mean using a credit card, well you could use a Bitcoin debit card at that rate.


But horrendous as a store of value.

Don't be absurd. With a lottery ticket you more likely just ending up with a piece of worthless paper. Odds of winning being 20-300 million to one against of winning, depending on the country. 
With Bitcoin it will still have value even after a crash. And long term a high chance it will 10x at least.

Bigoted? Please. Trump and Pence reject climate change, Pence also rejects evolution. There is no generalisation here. 


Gravity is a theory.
Try jumping out a window and see what happens.
*Theory: a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained: Darwin's theory of evolution.*
It does not mean just a guess. These theories have been verified. Musk's theory (not his actually) hasn't been.

If Trump wants restrictions on muslims entering the US he sure as hell won't want cryptos entering or exiting the US that supposedly could be used to aid terrorists.

You haven't heard of altcoins? And look at what happened to Ethereum. The "original" fork (Classic) is worth over a dollar. However in general network effects preclude new coins from being successful, not because they don't have intrinsic value.

1. Almost everyone, even older people and those with little money have smartphones now. Not sure what your point is here. This has little to do with Bitcoin. It does its part. It's up to others to produce slick software and systems and interfaces for it.
2. The drop in price is mostly emotionally-driven. No one has suddenly started "printing" extra Bitcoins, diluting the supply. It's often a victim of its own success. It passes 10K everyone jumps on board, it crashes from 20k to 15k, the weak hands or those who invested more than they could afford start panicking. Longterm there is unquestionably an uptrend.
3. Does the average person use gold as a store of value?

Bitcoin is the only coin that was created spontaneously in complete obscurity and with zero expectation. There was no guarantee it would ever be worth anything. Now every alt is expected to reach a few cents at least. They are created to enrich their creators. Therefore they become centralized.

Not every or even many countries would ban it. And causing it to fall in value is not banning it. Anyway, limiting the purchase of Bitcoin or other alts would increase demand.

Bitcoin is fungible, not as much as gold - because it's not anonymous. Yet. But you can exchange one bitcoin for one bitcoin. The only problem at the moment is the possibility that one of the bitcoins might have illegal provenance. But a stolen Rembrandt would have the same problems.
Your paintings would not be valuable unless that have enough artistic value and you become well known or famous. It's not enough that they are rare. Paintings can be forged anyway. Especially modern ones since carbon dating can't be much good.
People adopt and demand Bitcoins because they believe they will rise in value because of their rarity and deflationary aspects. When enough people own them commerce will follow.

It allows you to store and send value without an intermediary. Traditional systems don’t offer this. It’s un-confiscate-able. Your money in the bank can be seized. Even gold ownership has been illegal in the recent past.

@_date: 2017-08-25 17:49:14
It clearly was. Limited supply, mined, deflationary. None of the characteristics of cash. Which by definition is physical only, anyway.
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:35:17
Nothing more prominent than that? A post at least. This doesn't even have a plus karma, so not many agreed with him.

Not that it matters. It wasn’t a manifesto or the Bible.

It was stable for months in 2015.
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:07:24
@_date: 2019-11-03 12:57:32
That’s what I said.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:45:32
And Bitcoin doesn't? You're assuming the stuff being pirated has intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:33:22
To be fair it's also gone many weeks or months of stability.

In that case surely one coin would be better? We have enough hassle converting fiat currencies as it is.
And surely there enough alts extant for this already?
The second part of my answer could apply to the rest of your response.
@_date: 2017-01-17 10:58:23
Frictionless transactions?
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:52:32
Never saw that coming. /s
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:58:01
Price drop. Happy now?
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:10:31
Long term it's ok.
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:21:12
If you mean its immutability, yes.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:53:34
There's no replay protection and the developers are dodgy as hell. No thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:22:10
Don't worry about it. �� It was a while ago.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:19:37
To sell it when it peaks.

PSA? Anecdotal account does not make it necessarily so.
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:05:00
Completely different situation. Can they ban you carrying Bitcoin on a plane or in a restaurant?
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:38:18
Too many weak-handed noobs who bought in recently doesn't help.
The wily traders who snatch up their coins are not displeased.

@_date: 2017-01-04 23:46:51


[You sure?](
Anyway, I think the OP's warning is a little hyperbolic. Bitcoin is rallying because folks are trading - on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:38:31
They hadn't previously gone to $1200 though.
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:18:07
But 9 months is?
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:30:46
Then you don’t understand it. It’s the first time in history we have full control over our own money. The dollar is used far more for criminal activity, so this part sounds like desperate trolling. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:03:35
Fine, but it's clearly modelled on gold. Mined, limited supply, increasingly hard to mine, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:27:05

The last one was meant to cause chaos too.

Your vision. There are already satisfactory solutions for purchasing things daily. Bitcoin has more to offer. This will be just one of them - eventually. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:54:38

Yeah, like tulips are durable, fungible, unforgeable etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:32:37
So why did Satoshi model it on gold? And why respect the supposed vision of one man? A potentially disastrous thing in technology. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 13:33:56


No. Next!
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:48:17
Not agreeing with that guy, but the price rising does not disprove what he said.

You're still evading the point about copies not being the same thing. You said Bitcoin can be merely copied. I'm not talking about currencies. Forget about currency for a second, will you? It's not the point here.
In any case comparing Bitcoin with a rare painting as money is very silly. Bitcoin blows it out of the water for the reasons talked about before. Verifiable, transferable, fungible, not too rare, convenient etc.


No, they aren't. And you know fine well they aren't. As I mentioned elsewhere (to you?) you can't just cut off the exact amount of gold off your nugget and give it to the vendor. And then expect him to instantly assay/verify it. And that's just in person. Forget about online.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:37:18
No it hasn't. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 03:02:01


My bones doubt we'll go that low. Market is a bit more mature now.

I'll say whatever hell I want about Monero here. Shouldn't even be discussing it on this sub.

Be careful what you wish for. Anyway for those who bought a few years ago it's still great.
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:27:42
Is any traditional payment direct? Apart from cash?

@_date: 2017-08-23 16:16:49


So why should miners prefer it, if so?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:48:09
Yet he modelled it on gold. The white paper is not the holy bible anyway and Satoshi gave up. 
Bitcoin should play to its strengths. Censorship-resistance, limited supply etc.
It will have a fight on its hands to usurp Visa and Mastercard.

A completely sensible investment. Providing he has the money to spare. Nothing has returns like Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-01-17 16:21:47
Yes. It might go down a bit again but hold. Don't try trading if you're not experienced.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:57:08
You miss the point. What need for a cash to be rare?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:32:40
But no replay protection and BCH makes 2X redundant.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:04:02
True, gold is also physical but few use it as a currency nowadays.
I don't dispute the last bit.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:10:14

Quality is no guarantee of greater popularity. That's my point.
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:10:03
You won't get killed investing in Bitcoin. 
Secondly, the statistics for car accidents are horrifying. Bitcoin has risen every year except in 2014. And up a million or so percent since its inception.

@_date: 2018-10-05 00:17:32
It's not just denominated in Bitcoin though is it? "Bitcoin" is just the best known denomination because it shares the name of the protocol. There are 8 decimal places. Anyway, is it so hard to price something at, say, "10,000 satoshis"?

12 year high.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:42:08
There was nothing wrong with including Segwit. It featured a fix for the malleability bug for one thing.
The ticker BCC was taken from Bitconnect. That was nothing to do with opponents. The name Bitcoin Cash is unimaginative and confusing. It's far from being cash, and there already is a Bitcoin.
Some miners don't want Segwit because then they can't use asicboost.

@_date: 2017-08-01 22:01:33


I'm well aware of that. I think you misunderstood me.
I was talking about Satoshi's design for Bitcoin. If it were a cash substitute why model it after gold?
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:13:41
You have a source?
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:35:21
Not exactly original is it?
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:07:52
Yeah? Why aren't people willing to pay for said pirated items if they're so valued, then? They just want them for free. Easy to say they have value for you if you're getting them for nothing.
Bitcoin has value because it has utility and it's rare. People cannot pirate Bitcoin; cannot be counterfeited - that in itself is very valuable.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2016-06-16 10:20:08
Why cash out?
@_date: 2016-06-12 07:47:57

@_date: 2017-08-01 20:07:03
You wouldn't think it from the downvotes I'm getting. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:30:52
Pretty well known.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:22:45


It depends on how they were acquired. And it depends on each recipient whether to accept them or not. They cannot be frozen by the miners or devs. Use a mixing service and you're fine anyway. Or wait for MimbleWimble and the like.
People buy bitcoins because they want to be in charge of the own money also. Paypal is not a currency and it's centralized. Not everyone uses it anyway.
@_date: 2019-11-17 03:36:01
Drop dead, jerk off.

It's a pity they couldn't just start from scratch instead of hijacking the btc blockchain.

@_date: 2017-01-06 02:56:59
He's talking about a year from now. Many believe that Bitcoin could be 3x by then.
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:58:10
Can you give examples? New users treated well I think unless they come across as arrogant or pretending to know more than they do.
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:52:14
The price goes up and down like an elevator. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:49:58
Who says it just a currency?
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:18:30
And rob Bitcoin proper of some its network effect? No way. Let them create their own coin.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:42:54
He also called it Bitcoin. It's not a coin.
Clearly Bitcoin is not just a mere cash replacement (cash is physical only, anyway), since it cannot be seized or stopped and you own all keys, it is also your own bank. If Bitcoin were just another cash substitute it wouldn't stand a chance against PayPal or credit cards.
@_date: 2016-11-25 13:42:46
It mimics real world mining though, the name is not just a bit of marketing like "digital cash". 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:19:14
How did you post this?
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:58:44
A certain kind of rarity is valuable. Why is gold valuable or Action Comics No. 1 or a Penny Black stamp?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:55:50


That's debatable. Blocks are either mined very slowly or empty blocks are being mined. And nearly all by only one mining pool.


Again it's debatable this was the proven plan. Bitcoin even as BCH is not a very good currency. It's certainly nothing like cash.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:30:48
Cash by definition is physical and has a limited number of denominations. So "with vast efficiency" may be overstating it.
@_date: 2018-10-15 04:00:23
Ha, those idiots who bought high at $28 in 2011.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:58:50
The exchanges will choose the names not 2x-ers.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:55:58
OK. Good!
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:07:43
Yeah. Never has an alt been given this much publicity or this much undeserved validation. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:08:56
Why waste your precious Bitcoin on this crap?
@_date: 2017-01-16 13:00:51
Understandable even if it were mainstream.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:38:40
It doesn't matter.

@_date: 2017-01-06 16:18:35
Fake news caused by traders wanting to short I reckon.
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:58:03
It broke the previous ATH as far as I'm concerned. Last time was due partially to Willy bot. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:36:21
No, because there's support at around $740. Falls below that and it could go well lower.
@_date: 2018-10-04 03:08:57
It's not exactly cash, but yes.
@_date: 2018-10-25 05:07:30
I think it may be consolidation. Of course it could go down more but eventually it may be stabilize for several months. It's what happened in 2013 and 2015.
@_date: 2016-11-01 00:06:43
I'm not talking down to but don't blame Bitcoin itself for the shoddy infrastructure around. Bitcoin has never been hacked.
@_date: 2016-11-01 00:16:11
But Bitcoin is trying to ape gold's rarity not its market cap (or amount traded). The latter hopefully will come in time.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:00:51
You missed the "more than any other crypto" part.
As for not caring, I don't think being a currency or a Visa replacement is Bitcoin's strong point.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:38:29
What effort? It went to $4000 without the likes of Amazon accepting it. It doesn't need to be a payment mechanism at this stage in its history. That will come later.
@_date: 2016-11-05 02:17:36
Some do obviously. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:08:00
Why has it got a long way to go?
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:27:59
They want only "Satoshi's vision".
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:00:48
Depends on your time frame.
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:42:30
That’s the bcash version. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:31:12
So why should the miners care?
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:13:49
There'll still be chumps who think alts offer something different. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:57:28
Was your comment a ploy? :-P
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:12:43
There's nothing to stop it matching the market cap of the dollar or gold.

Don't sodl your digital godl.
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:38:49

That's lightning, no?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:03:28
Big blocks at any cost it seems including at the cost of backward compatibility and security. Very rational. Let them use bcash. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:18:49
Tolls, (micro-)payments for exact distances travelled, parking etc etc.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:50:08
Dogmatically sticking to a supposed early vision is a sure route to stagnation. 
It's equally arguable anyway that Satoshi intended it as a gold substitute (rarity, diminishing returns, mining analogous to the real world etc. )
@_date: 2016-11-20 01:57:55
There as more or more who'll accept seg wit.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:20:57
Credit card transactions are not instant. Only appear to be. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:14:24
Or a very old photo. ;-)
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:46:15
People also said it would go to 100. $770 is nothing? Tell that to people who bought when it was a few cents, or even below 100.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:21:52


That's debatable.
I will keep the BCH I have yes. Sell at a good price. Won't make the mistake ETH people made selling off their ETC to early.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:35:52

Good sign.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:43:49


Or through Bitcoin rising? Probably not.
Bitcoin was not designed for this type of thing anyway. As someone once it's like using Concorde to go to the corner shop.
Hence the existence of a Lightning.

Aren’t you just as bad as the people last year who  thought it would rise forever because it had done so for the last 12 months?
@_date: 2018-10-04 03:11:15
Does anyone take bcash seriously? So why compare it with the dollar?
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:35:12
I might get more if it drops bit lower.

Buying in 2013 was easy if you knew where to go. Blockchain.info sold then and it was a piece of cake.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:50:19
Despite the cash blurb Satoshi used he obviously based it on gold.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:34:04
We heard it would go to 1500 before the last fork.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:50:11
Nor does mainstream adoption. Patience.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:10:29
Only the network breaking irrevocably could send it to zero. There will always be fans of Bitcoin, if only for nostalgic reasons. Therefore I don't believe it will ever go to zero.

If Trump helps Bitcoin it'll be because the dollar will have plunged because of his incompetence.

It's also risen several million per cent in 9 years.

So does leaving it in the hands of someone else. I don’t know why all the crocodile tears over a foolhardy millionaire. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 14:11:38
Because they buy when things look rosy and sell when there's blood on the streets instead of doing the reverse.

It can be but it's overplayed on Reddit.

That'll be the price after it crashes from 10,000.
@_date: 2016-06-30 21:32:53
A serious threat of a hard fork, even for supposedly beneficial reasons, would probably tank the price.

Is it that unpredictable?  It’s often a period of consolidation followed by a rise and a bubble then a crash followed by consolidation. Short term it can be tricky all right. But day traders like that.

That's nonsense. They are currencies with larger market caps which are more volatile.

They wouldn't make as much money. Network effect would be further diluted.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:41:17
And why should they want your Bitcoin? They need to desire it. If they do it's because they want to keep it.
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:42:01
They've turned their attention to Ethereum. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:56:26

You held? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:23:27


And it NEVER will.
Very brave assertion. It already has in various currencies. The dollar is on a 12-Year high otherwise the ATH would've been breached already. The market cap has reached a ATH - despite there being more Bitcoins than 3 years ago. 
Currently only a few hundred dollars off ATH. Very foolish to think it'll never be breached. Technically there's nothing at all to stop it from happening.
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:35:22
Broke ATH in various major currencies, pound, euro, etc. And the dollar is on a 12 year high - which was almost breached.

Aren't they getting it in fiat?
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:27:47
That's not meaningless. Both pens (if the same obviously) have equal value. Sure, they are just pens.
Your pens however are not rare though to be used as money. Nor can they send value over the internet without fear of seizure. Nor can they buy dollars.

@_date: 2016-12-23 17:09:14
Not true at all. It's primarily a store of value, like gold. But unseizable and borderless. If it's value derived from it being a currency it would be worth just a few dollars at present.

@_date: 2018-06-26 00:50:18


There have always been risks. The whole thing is experimental. But there will always be risk-takers.


I mentioned there were new buyers also. Anyway, obviously, with it going to 19-20k someone was fervent despite Bitcoin bottoming out at 87% or whatever just a couple years before.


Is that necessarily a bad thing anyway? Bitcoin would benefit from less FOMO which lead to it being wildly overbought leading to large corrections or crashes.


Bitcoin had two bubbles in 2013. Willy bot had something to do with it but how could people have forgotten about it crashing to from $220-250 to $60 just six months before?
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:46:03

@_date: 2018-06-20 19:12:39
No they are not. They only appear to be. The shop only checks you have enough funds but it takes days or weeks for it to be cleared - which is why the tx doesn't appear on your statement for a while.
The miners are securing the network - they are not just wasting power. You think gold mining etc. doesn't use up resources?
Lightning is working now. Do keep up.
And don't confuse disagreements over block sizes with interfaces. I've never seen any controversy over this. Anyway, I already mentioned there are Bitcoin debit cards.

@_date: 2016-11-01 00:22:10

$20? Have you a source for this?
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:10:39
Many don't know about Bitcoin of course or how to use it.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:56:03
Didn't Theymos on here the other day say no one doesn't want bigger blocks at some point?
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:53:01
They probably take cash also. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:16:21


It's by far the most decentralized crypto. And that what matters. And the miners don't have the control you think they do. The nodes control Bitcoin.


LOL! Seriously? This is like saying making a replica of the Mona Lisa makes it less scarce. Altcoins are not Bitcoin.


It is if you mine it or mix it.


A very small window.
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:12:21
He could have. In any case Bitcoin has bigger fish to fry.
@_date: 2019-08-31 04:45:52
Even if he’s happy with it?
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:24:00
Is that your hideaway?
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:27:24
Since the halving?
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:22:34
Down is down. There was a lot of traffic but the network still was working. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:23:06
The other coins are less volatile? I think not. Except for Tether - in which case just use dollars.
@_date: 2016-11-20 03:39:56
No. Just looks odd. Bit odd you're here too. Sockpuppet account?
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:10:57
Sounds like he wants his cake and eat it.
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:36:04
Nearly all alts are doing this more subtly one way or another. Promising the returns of Bitcoin, or to be better than Bitcoin or be the next Bitcoin. Scams all.
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:20:02
You’re as bad as the people at the end of last who thought it would keep rising forever.
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:32:14
Trying to predict what large groups of people might do is not in any way comparable to believing heavenly bodies affect our lives.

Being stagnant isn't.
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:34:05


I assume you mean about $1,200? The market cap of gold is much higher though. So 1 btc wouldn't really equate to an ounce of gold.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:04:33
They don't. Satoshi didn't develop bcash.
@_date: 2019-08-22 00:02:02
He meant next we hear about it.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:55:06
And you think they will hold their value long term?
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:51:42
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:35:15
And yet if merchants don't use Bitcoin we complain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:52:59
Don't believe the blurb. It's clearly modelled on gold. It's absolutely nothing like cash. Even BCH isn't.
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:00:37
Also, there was a warning pinned to the top of the page telling people not to invest more than they afford to lose. It wasn't saying buy buy buy.
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:37:30


500% in itself is good but not if you invest too little. There have been plebty of shitcoins that have done that last year anyway. 500,000% or invest a lot more than Greg did would be a lot better.




You rather obnoxiously keep questioning my knowledge on things but you foolishly seem to think that you are inscrutable.
All of your answers have been cop outs. Or if you prefer non-answers, non-argumnets. You still have yet to address the point about Bitcoin's (reducing) supply being a reason to hold. There, I used simpler words for you.


Wrong, as usual.
No doubt I could find older ones but I'm not wasting any more time over you.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:07:07
So hold or get out.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:46:58
If you think it's going to 700 or even if if did might have trouble reversing you need your head examined.

@_date: 2019-08-20 01:34:35
I would certainly take Nano over bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:20:37
Now you're talking.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:31:12
You say potatoe, I say...
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:00:06
@_date: 2017-01-18 00:13:52
If you're willing to buy at 1100, around 800 should not be a problem. I'm sure he's thinking long term.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:19:12
155.3 % ;-)
Why the downvotes? This correct if nitpicking.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:06:46
Intriguing idea. If this were possible and sanctioned.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:06:04


It has several aspects of gold. It only falls short as being less fungible because txs are traceable - at the moment. In every other respect it trumps gold monetarily.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:10:03
And when the price hits a new ATH the non buyers will bleat “hindsight is 20/20”
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:03:44
Try carrying over 10,000 dollars or whatever across some borders.
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:38:26
They can take your money also.
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:29:06


Cash is physical anyway. Digital cash makes no sense.
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:25:41
For its tiny market cap Bitcoin is amazingly stable.
@_date: 2019-08-01 02:36:34
Doesn’t he have to give a speech?
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:37:49
As far as we know.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:19:52
There was a crash from about 250 to 60 dollars early in 2013 then 90 to 1250 later in the year. Nothing like that happened last year. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:24:54
Don't make more of it than it deserves. Just some trying to produce a new alt. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:31:40


Was it? Why does it ape gold's rarity and mining, then?
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:21:27
They can do whatever they want. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:57:16
But only you know when it will stop?
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:05:47


It's still more secure than a bank account. That's the point. You can use this government will torture you argument for anything.


There are, as you suggest legal means.
Obviously the best security is not letting people know you even have Bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:56:52
On the other hand you have a supremely immutable censorship-resistant store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:59:09
I thought that bullshit was behind us (bcash). 
Anyway 2x is not backward compatible. Did you read it?
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:06:02
Methinks they protest too much
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:06:32
Or you could hold off from buying and it could be 6500-7000 next week or this price for the next 6 months. Who knows? People say buy the dip because no one is sure when it’ll level off. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:59:40
I know that’s what I’d be doing if I had a few thousand coins. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:45:06
Cash is completely untraceable, fungible and physical only. Whatever Bitcoin is it is not cash, however the creator wanted to market it.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:14:12
People who've been through all this before are chuckling at these predictions of doom.
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:53:00
Perhaps it already has all been sold. Possibly another reason for the fall in price. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:33:44
Not just governments, debt collectors, failing banks etc. And what do you mean only? One is enough. Bitcoin gives you 100% control over your money. Being able to buy coffee is something that already be done satisfactorily.


If you secure it properly, of course.
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:59:20

Because this sub is to promote Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:27:58
That's how Bitcoin was designed. Live with it.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:55:07
Well, in your analogy it would be like comparing the unpleasant developments in the US to North Korea. It’s still better than North Korea. 
And you know fine well Bitcoin has many merits. We are merely comparing a slump in Bitcoin price to a national currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:23:04
The last drop went to 160. And yet two and half years later 20k. So, no. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:04:47
Snapchat is frivolous though compared to what Bitcoin is capable of.
@_date: 2016-12-24 14:28:40
If you made a profit, maybe 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:22:19
If you’re just obsessed with the price. Zoom out anyway. And remember those who got in at 10 cents, 10 dollars etc. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:06:47
I'm not selling. Especially since I bought much lower. Just sold some alts I don't care about. 
But yeah, it's a good attitude to see it as a chance to get cheaper coins. Might buy more BTC too, with an eye on the next halving in two years.
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:24:17
Unlikely but what's to stop it?
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:46:29
There are insured exchanges (Coinbase) and Bitcoin vaults (Xapo).  
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:12:37
JUST for buying things I said. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:29:01
Some are just obsessed with big blocks at the price of everything else.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:03:24
Empty headed more like.
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:55:57

They are so sure it probably won't happen.

It's risen to $20,000 without hardly anyone accepting it. It doesn't need merchant adoption. It's also a store of value.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:28:37
A dollar could have fed a whole family once. So it won't buy you so much now.
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:20:55


Straw man, my hat. You were implying one person would be bringing 16 billion dollars. Why mention the market cap otherwise?


They believe in bullshit one way or the other. Let's not split hairs.


How the heck is this a straw man argument? I'm not putting words in your mouth here. Pence and Trump and a few of their cronies are anti-science troglodytes. End of.

Many make fun of MtGox's Magic the Gathering roots but these cards can be even pricier than a Bitcoin:
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:17:46
Of course the government could take all their bank savings. Which has happened a lot more than lost or stolen bitcoin wallets. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 17:38:44
Gold's value comes from its rarity, not so much use in jewellery.
@_date: 2016-12-14 02:01:06
Which ones?
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:18:10
So if they're harder to get wouldn't that increase demand?
@_date: 2019-08-22 00:02:38
Or they want to protect their money.
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:55:26
500x? Surely a gross exaggeration. 10x more like.
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:16:29


Because they can all be seized and cannot be sent easily over the internet.
If Bitcoin is successful it will be used eventually in commerce. More people need to own it first.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:02:19
Can you carry millions of dollars over borders without it being seized or you being questioned?
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:53:32
Yeah. I’ve been hearing that since Bitcoin was $10.

Behind the scenes, yes it does.

It's not news though. It's olds.
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:08:47
Bitcoin is not crappy though.

Intentional? Moot, surely. :-P
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:40:43
To be as fungible as gold perhaps, yes.
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:24:56
Lighten up.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:50:21
30 minutes? 10, joker. And 0 if the vendor accepts 0 confirmations. 


And who pays during a ride?
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:10:10
And when the next ATH comes you'll be crying hindsight again no doubt. It doesn't take a genius to see long term Bitcoin is an upward trend.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:13:42
Maybe because they bought it with fiat. 
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:08:52

@_date: 2018-06-22 19:30:09
Not necessarily. Depends on the size of the exchange and if it's not due to the native currency rising independently.

Outrage over the NSA snooping is fair game though. Would you mind if your emails were posted online? 
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:17:44
As it should be. We don't want another DAO. Anyway, there are services like Xapo.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:50:41
Exactly, there isn't any. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:31:11
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:07:11
You forget that the event itself is the halving of the reward miners get. The issuance is reduced so supply is reduced. Demand is not met so the price rises. No, I don't think it's priced in by any means. 19-20K was not justified admittedly, that was the product of fomo and other factors.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:22:40
That January 2015 was grim.
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:23:07
I think that will be the last stage of adoption if it happens. Needs to be a big enough market cap and a thorough infrastructure in place first. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:38:53
You are a master in the hodling arts
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:13:15

@_date: 2018-06-21 17:10:09
Whatever this is showing I'd rather buy Bitcoin than the tickets.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:55:35
Still up 10x
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:08:07
This is a problem with selling. People often don't buy back in, preferring to keep the money.
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:38:03
Early days yet.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:28:36
That would embolden them to hold btc to ransome in the future.
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:06:33
It wasn't worth nearly as much. They had slave labour to mine it. It was easier to guard because no one else had electricity or power to help steal it.
Anyway, that was then. This is now. Gold 5000 or 500 years ago certainly wouldn't compete with Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:22:47
There are still many in the black though. 
Anyway, as I said there were plenty of warnings. I'm just surprised the bull market lasted a year.


Don't let the door hit their asses on the way out. It's not for the faint-hearted.
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:37:33
Bitcoin already is more stable. Just not as fast or as cheap - yet.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:57:19
Never regret a profit. You did well. But try in future never to go full fiat. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:51:39


It's censorship resistant, very secure and deflationary. Those are good enough reasons for me. Some people do actually feel safer keeping their money there. Not everyone is investing. 


This aren't monetary features.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:10:06

Digital gold, then.
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:16:59
Philosophically it’s not a fork I don’t care what programmers call it.
@_date: 2016-12-24 14:29:30
So it'll go up once again. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:58:40
No good reason.    
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:40:33
Go to if you want doom and gloom.
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:03:05
What is in these that is sensational? Open borders?
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:01:25
The things I mentioned are valuable because certain pieces of each are rare due to being by a certain unique artist or because they weren't valued to begin with and just a few copies remain now.
You could argue these have historical interest and Bitcoin doesn't I suppose. But many collect them just as investments. However, Bitcoin has more utility.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:04:11
Witness. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:17:19
Still far from gold's market cap though.
@_date: 2019-08-01 23:08:48
Sounds like begging.

I’ve been on this sub six years. 
I didn’t see many seriously predicting 100k BTC. 30k was mentioned and seemed possible. But there were indeed warnings on here from some. 
The most ludicrous prediction I saw that was taken seriously was on the ripple sub where a few predicted $1000 xrp. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:59:08

This is misleading though. How long was it at $20,000? A few hours. $15000 would be a fairer comparison. Plus you're cherry-picking a recent bubble. Anyone who has bought Bitcoin in the last 9 years before the autumn has not lost money.

It's a copy and paste. That's not a fork. It has its own timeline.
It's a monetary matter also. Bcash did not deserve to start valued so highly just because it was a copy, albeit with some backing by leading miners, and some exchanges.
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:14:24


Because it's HARDER to seize it. Hence the higher mark above. No one says it's impossible.
As well as a key being much easier to hide than gold (it, a seed, can even be stored in your head) you could use multisig which relies on more than key. The Bitcoins could be timelocked - so released at a defined later date.
This is if they even know you have the coins or haven't sent them to someone else.

There was nothing to stop you investing $20,000 then. I don't what "bigness" has to do with it. The problem with crypto is that there are still too many noobs and weak hands in it. If and when it's mostly only Wall St then it will be big.


That's a very narrow example.


You underestimate how short memories are. Not to mention new buyers in the future who won't be aware of this crash. It looked like the end when it fell to 160 in 2015. Just two and half years later...

True, but Bitcoin is more analogous to gold.

@_date: 2018-06-20 16:39:58
Everyone who bought in the 9 years before last autumn has not lost money. 


There's no demand for Bitcoin? Really? What do you base that on? And how is a growing supply gold-like?
The price of gold is manipulated and the market cap is far bigger than Bitcoin's which is why it is more stable. Plus there are far fewer noobs trading it.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:05:20
If you are sending money, say $58 worth, in the form of Bitcoin to someone then it doesn’t matter what price it is. 
If it dropped to one dollar (highly unlikely of course) sure, people would lose money, just as many have gained, but this would be as high as the price needs to be to function. 
The price is dropping now because a lot of the buyers were interested in short term profits and do not care about or are not aware of Bitcoin’s strengths (censorship-resistance etc). 
Some will become fans and will hold. Which will help to create a floor. 
$1000 by 2020, the year of the next halving seems very unlikely. But why do think that because it has been falling for 7 months you think it will last forever? It kept rising for one year. Did you think, by November, it would go non stop eventually to a million dollars?
I saw it crash from 1250 to 160 over a similar period. It looked like the end. It consolidated at 200 for 6 months. Then after the last halving went on the bull run. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:48:03

It is not impossible. A larger market cap alone would bring stability. Whales would have little affect. Even now between large swings Bitcoin remains stable. Hanging around 950-60 at present. For most of 2015 the price stayed around $200.

"an instance of avoiding a commitment or responsibility" 
That sounds like your attitude.

I didn't say. The price of gold has skyrocketed in the last century. Do you deny that? Do you deny technological advances have helped in the processes I mentioned and it wouldn't be worth as much without them? Gold for example being far easier now to verify/assay than it was.

Gold cannot be sent over the internet and without fear of seizure. It's costlier to transport, guard, verify etc.
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:03:40
It’s more harmful to Bitcoin than healthy. Scammy coins can give Bitcoin a bad reputation and forks make some erroneously think Bitcoin is not scarce.
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:50:53


There's no question its recent rise was in part to technological advances. Which you didn't address. Also the ability to trade gold online or non-physical gold.


I did say Bitcoin was an ideal money. Or currency at least. Just better than gold.


What hurdles apart from fungibility? Even scaling doesn't matter if Bitcoin is content with being a digital gold.
Gold is easier to counterfeit, harder to verify and guard and transport. And easier to seize.

If you made a replica of a Rembrandt painting and said it was the true work wouldn't that be a scam? Or if you claimed it was better?
Alts are chiefly launched to line the pockets of their creators by claiming they are the next Bitcoin or better than Bitcoin or in this case the true Bitcoin and sucker in those who missed the Bitcoin boat.

@_date: 2018-06-25 17:37:42
Maybe. Judging by the last crashes that sounds like the absolute minimum. But I think it would be brief if it happens.
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:35:16
So why did Satoshi apparently model Bitcoin on gold mining? Gold mining is even mentioned in the white paper.
It's been considered a digital gold for years.

@_date: 2019-08-22 23:11:55
BCH is purely riding on Bitcoin’s shoulders. 
But they are all pretending to be better than Bitcoin or being the next Bitcoin. Bringing a lot of expectation - and thus money for their creators. Therefore scams.

Of course. Why do you think this post is here?

True. Although Bitcoin is harder to stop in this situation.

You can never have too many coins.
As I stated elsewhere, it's the negativity over Bitcoin vs gold that's mystifying. Or perhaps not - since Bitcoin is bearish at the moment. It will almost always be below its ATH.
@_date: 2019-10-16 14:07:51
You’re assuming Bitcoin will shared fairly and that it’s not very divisible. 
 What else is there besides gold that matters monetarily?

Gold is chiefly valuable because of its rarity. Water is far more useful. Even animals can use it.

Adoption is not buying lattes with it.
It already is being adopted as a censorship resistant store of value. A digital hedge against (hyper)-inflation. 


They seem to have no trouble buying $1000 phones. 


With a fixed monetary policy and no chance of going of its Bitcoin standard, why shouldn't it? 
It already has gone to the moon for many. Even if you bought this January.


I said five years plus. Don't buy in the middle of a bubble obviously.

@_date: 2019-08-27 16:59:19
That's why I don't like to call them forks. A fork (in a road for example) is retraceable. As well as it gives them some sort of validity in the eyes of some.

@_date: 2018-06-26 23:18:57
But it's mostly arbitrary.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:22:29
No, you're confused. You keep stating they started at the same point. That is not a fork. A fork is a path that splits in two, like a Y. What you are describing is like two paths - two parallel lines - ll.
Bcashers and others (not saying you're one) want people to think of bcash as a fork as it gives their shitcoin a faux pedigree.


Obviously the chains aren't scarce, the coins are - which is what gives the chains their security or lack of it due to the miner's financial incentives. Two separate chains. As I stated already - if you believe they both started at the same time - not a fork. If you believe bcash started in 2017 and think it's a fork then you believe it's another Bitcoin.
It's obvious you are a programming nerd. Try thinking in terms of money.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:23:12

It was above $15K for a week or so. As opposed to ten years. They even had a chance to sell at 14K this year and cut their losses - if they held that long.
And of course some lost money - I'm talking about those who have the stomach to hold.
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:14:35
This drop must be getting to you. Why compare it stuff like Enron which as said are not comparable?  We can only compare it to other Bitcoin bubbles and crashes and Bitcoin always shown resilience. 
Even if Bitcoin dropped to one dollar it would still be an excellent means of securing and transferring value. 
@_date: 2019-10-20 02:52:25
It sounds more like you bought at 20K judging by the salt.
You seem to think it will never exceed 20K again. I heard all these arguments after the December 2013 bubble and the subsequent bear market.
Long term Bitcoin kicks gold's ass.

@_date: 2018-06-13 19:45:21
Products that require tech.
It's not mere perception. Every year that passes infrastructures improve making it easier for newer tech to integrate. Bitcoin has it relatively easy thanks to smart phones, wifi, cell networks etc. It would have been very difficult 20 years ago and impossible before that.

It would still count.

For 1% of people the current system works perfectly. Prevent fraud in the first place. Improve security. Don't use refunds as an excuse to have people tinkering around with our funds. The banks are often bigger criminals anyway. HSBC laundering billions for example or Cyprus seizing their customers funds.


Ahh no you’re just so wrong. We moved to a new system because the new system allows the economy and country to grow faster. Creates more jobs and opportunity for people. You don’t see countries changing back to gold standard do you? No because it’s a step backwards like going back to horse and cart.
I don't get your horse and cart analogy. It doesn't apply in this case at all. If it did it would be like using a vast army of imaginary horses and carts to wage wars. Gold is far better than cash. It's no horse and cart. Come up with a far better analogy please. 
You can only afford so much with gold, it being limited. Once you can print as much cash as you want however...


You were boasting about how it was all online.


If you can off the gold standard anything is possible.


You don't make it easier for people to get murdered! Like giving psychos assault rifles. They don't care about laws. Don't make fraud easier.


And you've been drinking too much of the Keynesian kool aid.


How, when all Bitcoin txs are traceable? How when exchanges use KYC? You can safeguard your money but you can still go to prison or be fined.


So how the fuck do they manage in Monaco and the United Arab Emirates? You were talking about income tax anyway. You fibber.


Why is the US $22 trillion in debt anyway?
 I managed to have a debate like this with  a user called Toyake without him once throwing insults and being fucking arrogant. Calm down.

Why would the high volume bother me? The liquidity is much better now than in the past due to more currency pairs and more, better exchanges.
Some people got burned but just as many made a lot of money.
There were plenty of warnings on here (and no doubt) elsewhere that it could go pop any moment so December buyers have only themselves to blame. And of course - you should not to invest more than you can afford to lose.
Anyway no doubt there are very few holders from 20k. 
At most they might have lost 5-10% trying to make 5-10% or more.

If he bought enough coins in 2013-4 he can. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:47:16
Depends on what you use Bitcoin for. If it's as a hedge against government's meddling with fiat it's fine now.
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:35:15
That’s easier said than done.
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:23:03
Is it?
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:56:12
It is in crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-31 16:14:07
And held?
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:15:53
To be fair, it's not really. Yet. 
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:58:44
Huh. Right.
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:05:48
Charlie Munger said it.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:05:16
Fear of the new.
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:20:04
Maybe, maybe not. It's not services like this Bitcoin was designed to replace anyway. Chiefly as way of storing your money without an intermediary.
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:38:39
Not the logo. Makes it look like another coin.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:25:46
Thanks. ;-)
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:37:07
They've accepted it for ages.
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:39:48
They can still use it but they make much money from it.
@_date: 2019-10-19 20:28:34
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:42:17
Because of this type of thing. Plus listed bcash on date without warning and supported Segwit2X.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:27:04
And has risen millions of per cent in a few years.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:25:20
It's not that volatile but I take your point. I think it will be more stable if and when the market is more mature and the market cap is much bigger.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:51:51
That’s what people like you say when you get it wrong. 
A finite, deflationary and immutable currency will rise in value in the future. Who’d have thought it??!
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:30:04
It didn't get consensus so it's just an alt.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:23:05
Ha ha.  Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. It’s designed to siphon off value from other assets. And yes we were talking about returns here not stability. Bitcoin will be more stable anyway when its market cap is much bigger. 
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:57:55
BCH and BSV are altcoins pure and simple, just as Litecoin is.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:21:25
It’s not his coin though. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:44:37


That's the whole point of a good store of value - to protect against debasement of fiat currencies!!! 
It's all relative. Whether it's because BTC is stronger or the pound for example is weaker it doesn't matter. 
There's absolutely nothing special about $1200. It will breached. Just as there was nothing special about $1, $100, $266 etc. 
@_date: 2019-10-09 00:12:37
Good. It'll stop them putting their life savings into it and be a bit more cautious.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:48:16
I would question it has problems with centralization. The S2x fork could not be foisted on Bitcoin despite powerful backers. 
Lightning fixes the tx issues. 
Other prime movers have not been as revolutionary or had the network effect Bitcoin has. It will be difficult to usurp. I don’t see any other coins immune to this bear market for example. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:06:39
That will come. No reason other services or layers couldn't do this type of thing.
Anyway, even if it doesn't the world's first ever and best SoV without an intermediary is nothing to sneeze at.
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:53:34
As I answered elsewhere: 
If you made a replica of a Rembrandt painting and said it was the true work wouldn't that be a scam? Or if you claimed it was better?
Alts are chiefly launched to line the pockets of their creators by claiming they are the next Bitcoin or better than Bitcoin or in this case the true Bitcoin and sucker in those who missed the Bitcoin boat.
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:25:49
There's no question that in general Bitcoin has produced far better returns. Even if you bought Bitcoin at gold's price as it was 20 years ago, about $300.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:02:53


"And they shouldn’t have, make money and get out, buy back in with less stress."
That's sounds like you think he did well.


I used it in the way I intended. Once again you are skirting a point. Would you prefer I produced my own dictionary definition?


You haven't rebutted a thing I said. Just tiresome diversionary tactics.
As for being aware of Bitcoin's characteristics, I've been in it for 6 years you honestly believe I don't know it's finite, deflationary and censorship-resuitant? Give me a fucking break.


Now you are getting boring. And unquestionably quite wrong. Greg done fucked up.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:03:23
100? Seriously?
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:36:00
These are all generalisations.
And why should a Bitcoin forum support another coin?
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:25:40
With Bitcoin you don't need mortgages.
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:21:58


@_date: 2018-06-13 17:36:13
For a moment I thought you understood the post. Bitcoin can proliferate very fast because the infrastructure is already in place (wifi, cellphones, etc). It just needs killer apps, better interfaces etc.
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:27:02
Fat chance it'll go that low.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:47:25
Let's get everything else right first.
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:30:57
Tell me what has given better returns in the last ten years?
I've done very out of Bitcoin. (And check my post history if you doubt how long I've been in Bitcoin).
Buying two or three grand's worth now will not kill anyone. Fucking drama queen.
@_date: 2019-10-15 06:22:03
How long would it take for gold to be transported and assayed?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:37:01
Some not so reluctant - like in Venezuela. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:27:00
Because banks don't have fees /s
With Bitcoin you have sovereignty over your money.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:19:40
Where did it go to 5k?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:08:39
We won't become more technologically advanced with Bitcoin constantly upgraded or exchanged to a totally new version if need be?
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:20:24
So if you are sending a set amount like $10 what does it matter what price Bitcoin is? And at least Bitcoin will be more secure.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:16:02
That is using it.
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:57:29
Not exactly news though is it?
@_date: 2019-10-20 02:34:42
Gold is still a mediocre investment in comparison, even if you make a more conservative comparison. Not to mention, it's harder to buy and sell, harder to guard and transport etc.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:40:46
It was at around $200 for many months. Then was a good time.
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:11:01
Better to mine it, then.
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:24:42
Isn't the Bitcoin network now more powerful than any computer?
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:11:22
Is that condescending twaddle the best argument you have?
It doesn't matter if it's their intention or not it's clear that is having an affect. Any fool can see that.
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:08:19
The Apprentice makers have hours of tape with him shooting his mouth off. Can they hack that?

@_date: 2019-08-10 21:17:51
Why are you buying if you don’t understand it or don’t know what to do with it?
@_date: 2019-08-01 13:58:36
The bcash of the MTG world.
@_date: 2019-08-27 02:29:03
Which is all that currently matters.
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:28:49
Even if that were so what possible what financial incentive would they have?
@_date: 2019-10-01 00:54:37
They will have to be at some point in the future when there are fewer Bitcoin's rewarded.
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:37:21
Why November 2015?

@_date: 2019-10-20 02:31:09


You are being prissy. It wasn't a personal attack.
There have been 4-5 burst bubbles in Bitcoin's history. They are exceptions. Bitcoin is on an upward trend long term.
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:33:34
I did recommend at 1-2K in 2017 to a friend. Anything over 10K would seem extortionate for someone who first bought in 2013. Frankly, though I just keep quiet.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:56:52
Are we comparing monetary features or you want to tell me gold is shiny and you can touch it? So there's demand for these things? Who cares? Let's compare them solely as money. You can't transfer gold over the internet.


Then perhaps Bitcoin is not a currency.
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:34:42
I remember these memes at 300
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:42:57
Only works if you've not secured it properly.
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:19:26
A replica is a better word, as we know Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited. But bcash not really a fork. A fork is retraceable. Bcash is not backward compatible. And a scan of the Mona Lisa (or a MTG card etc) is a direct copy. But that doesn’t give it much value.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:33:47
Anyway, needs a NSFW tag?
@_date: 2018-06-01 02:00:48
Depends how long he wants to hold.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:29:08
It's also a store of value. This is an actual use.
@_date: 2019-10-22 05:34:37
You mean one that kisses the anus of the Fed?
The US is $22 trillion in debt. THAT is ridiculous.

Too centralized (VB), not censorship resistant (e.g. the dao), not as scalable as claimed, promises more than it can deliver.

Don't confuse Bitcoin with the markets. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:45:26


If you believe this, Bitcoin may not be for you.
Anyway, could use smart contracts.


Bitcoin is certainly not for you.


If you use multisig (more than one key necessary) or timelock (released only in the future) no force will get them.
If they even know you have them.
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:11:54
The value comes from people holding. Those who spend get their BTC converted to fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:41:49
It take just a few seconds if the vendor supports 0conf or something similar. Plus there are Bitcoin debit cards.
I prefer to see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a censorship resistant store of value.
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:21:55
Just stick to arguments and stop being fucking obnoxious.
How is any of that Bitcoin's fault? Improve the infrastructure.
I've been to places where cash was not accepted.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:18:27
That's because he is.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:37:06
No. Certainly not. They were saying before the last one when Bitcoin was about 400-500 dollars. Then a few months after the halving Bitcoin started its big run.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:19:02
Are you joking? It’s the early adopters who take all the risks. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:56:30
You don't need the internet. Any kind of network or way of transferring info will do.

The Polystation of crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:33:25
Why is it silly? It's a national currency. And we were comparing a "weakened" Bitcoin to the bolivar. Long term Bitcoin is better than any currency if you are considering returns. Apart from stability it's better than every respect than the US dollar.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:52:07
Cynical. Or he bought it because he believes in it? He's right anyway. He's not just saying Bitcoin is better, believe me. He gave good reasons.
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:55:46
All promises. No substance.
@_date: 2016-12-17 12:52:30
Monero fell again a bit though didn't it? And ETH.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:59:48
It is no more analogous to cash than it is to gold or anything else that holds value. It's closer to gold in fact. Aping gold's rarity. 
Cash can be printed at will and has in cases become worthless. See Zimbabwe, early 20th century Germany etc. 
Bitcoin has millions of denominations. This is not at all like cash. 
The last point concerns fungibility not transactions. The FBI or whoever still cannot see if I hand you a marked note and then you hand back to me or hand to someone else.
@_date: 2019-10-01 15:02:10
Not sure about the second one. Although it's funny people expect (nay, demand)  Bitcoin to be accepted everywhere when no other money is.
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:42:11


First rule of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:12:34
Smart contracts can’t enforce anything legally.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:54:29
Don't think you're a fool but you seem to think it will keep crashing and ignore the fact that most people bought in the 9 years preceding December.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:56:21
By the time the young adult has paid it off he's a very old adult.
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:20:40


Are you saying you can make new BTC from thin air without mining? And no, a "fork" altcoin is not BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:48:43
There are many hedge funds, etc involved now also, don't forget. It's not just individuals.
@_date: 2019-10-29 18:58:34
He tried to use it fraudulently.
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:24:18
It matters if they get Bitcoin and then sell it. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:01:08
If they include the price shift over 9 years also.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:55:06
Yeah. And I’m tired of hearing about the minority who bought in December. They were warned not to invest more than can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:15:14
Anyone who bought and held five years ago could have done it.
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:08:01
By tomorrow at this rate 
@_date: 2019-08-02 03:15:41
A fork (like in a road) though is retraceable. These are not compatible with clients of Bitcoin. Even old ones. 
And basically they are just printing money and doing Bitcoin harm by making it seem to some that Bitcoin isn’t scarce.
@_date: 2019-10-16 19:29:19
Then you have to wait. Don't expect to get rich quick.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:35:51
I'm not trolling. Bcash doesn't have a history of running ten years non-stop, or of having to start from absolute 0, price-wise and from complete obscurity.
You're acting like they have the same history. They don't. Sharing some code doesn't give the same history.
@_date: 2019-08-01 23:21:30
Or just use an s. S100 for example.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:30:46
You're talking horseshit. The cost of mining has gone up drastically. No one could mine profitably at one dollar now. And the number of miners won't drop that low.
@_date: 2019-08-22 00:03:17
How much will it cost? Everything.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:58:18

@_date: 2018-06-26 04:43:42
1250 no? And you could be right but it's wise not to be too sure. I never expected the last bubble to last so long judging by previous ones for example.
@_date: 2019-10-02 03:25:21
If you bought December 2013 you had to wait 4 years.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:29:10
Easier said than done. Most probably keep any profits.
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:48:37
Someone said they’d put their life savings into it. Not necessary that early.
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:49:40
Whereas you're advocating panic selling.
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:54:43
There are mixing services. And it can be sold for Monero say then re-bought.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:37:34
The market determines the price. But if you want to send or spend $10 worth it doesn't matter what the price is.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:14:33
One that people care about are. 
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:26:27
At least I'm not a rude asshole.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:08:49
Monero or a similarly anonymous alt would be better, no?
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:35:06
The market cap is still very small and there are a lot of noobs trading.
@_date: 2019-10-19 20:30:59


You must be joking, judging by the comments. "oh, if you bought in December 2017, blah blah". There's cherry-picking of the highest order. There've been 4-5 bubbles in total.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:26:53

And politics has no effect on development.
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:30:51
The safest way is to buy say $50-100 a week. Evens out then.

Don’t agree they think half of that.
@_date: 2019-10-29 19:41:36
He chose the amount.
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:40:15
It says course of action.
@_date: 2019-10-01 15:36:34
I'm not the one coming up with stupid scenarios.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:48:10
Depends on when he bought. Maybe he got them for 50 cents. 
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:58:46
Why do you need to understand how half of that works?
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:58:11
 Buy some and hold. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:21:06
Jesus, what a rude cunt. You're assuming enough people will stop mining. It's not going to happen. The reward has dropped to 12.5 coins also. Good luck on your shitty old mining set up.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:38:24
But it's ok to cherry pick the last few months? Most people bought in the preceding 9 years.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:47:40
21 btc.
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:40:16
Halving mostly I think.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:24:32
Newcomers with pocket change won't make much difference anyway. 
@_date: 2019-10-02 04:22:28
Or gold 2.0
@_date: 2019-08-12 21:01:14
Or for making more Bitcoin. If you play your cards right.
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:40:50


I'm arguing it's not a fork.
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:10:10
And are still holding.
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:26:03
Buy a little every week or month
@_date: 2019-10-19 20:27:15
Doesn't it disprove his point? Or his comment is childish?
@_date: 2019-10-01 23:10:11
*Could* go above 10k by then but 16 looks very unlikely.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:52:39
2,100,000,000,000,000 arbitrary units. Theoretically they could be divided more.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:47:36
Will you buy back in? The problem is there’s always a temptation to keep the fiat. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:13:55
He compared them a few times. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:24:14
Once? If you mean offshoots like bcash - they are not forks as they didn't achieve consensus.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:13:28
It has to start somewhere. No need for the over the top sarcasm. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:35:28
1K? Good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-10-29 01:32:41


Unless they are lucky or wise enough to invest well...
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:48:16
Because you couldn’t do that with a credit card.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:45:41
More than 10% if you count from 9K.
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:35:01
For most people yes, but stuff like price support is not bullshit. Anyway, anyone who believes Bitcoin will drop or rise is guilty of some kind of analysis.
@_date: 2019-10-20 01:14:54
Look at a log chart for the last ten years for some perspective. I'm tired of people bitching about buying at the height of bubbles. Fuck them.
@_date: 2019-10-20 04:23:08
You’re not going to ignore ten years of data for an asset with a finite supply.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:23:58
Why do you need to do any of those? Gold cannot be spent at shops and why shouldn't Bitcoin remain Bitcoin? These are different matters anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:53:44
So there are different people buying in that case. It still applies.

He also put "coin" in the name. I don't care what blurb he put at the beginning of the white paper.
Cash is physical, not limited in supply, untraceable, has limited denominations, usually is limited to one country. If he was trying to make it like cash he did a poor job.

Most people who bought Bitcoin during its ten year history and held are in profit.

It has longevity also.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:00:34
Still has to be verified. Most people can be fooled with fake or partially fake gold.

Nah, it didn't make any sense. It's an altcoin. Why go there? And calling it a "Fork" gives it too much credibility.

Your call. So far even those who done well out of it have usually wished they had bought more.
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:00:05
I think Bitcoin needs these bubbles to encourage adoption. The lure of making money makes people buy it and then hopefully learn to love its other qualities.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:29:49
How could even newcomers be unaware of what had happened in early 2013? I myself bought coins during both those bubbles.
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:02:06
Why wouldn't it just be as useful?
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:32:51
Because they will see it as a get rich quick scheme and then fall in love with its qualities like immutability, security, etc.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:57:31

I tried to buy then but couldn't. Was very hard.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:08:23
Goes without saying.
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:01:35
It depends on how much they bought. They might still be holding some from then. Certainly are plenty from 10 dollars.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:32:26
It isn't. Or they aren't. More like a spin off. As I said a fork is retraceable. And calling them forks just gives them credibility. Aren't they using a copy of the genesis block?

Too much December 2017 stuff. You didn't have to get rekt buying then.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:44:13
You were wrong about not investing in Bitcoin earlier. Just admit it. This hindsight bias stuff is a cop out. As I said already a finite, deflationary and immutable currency rising in price in the future was a no brainer.
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:05:21
You can already do that with cash and a credit card, how would another way be revolutionary?

They cannot change the protocol or anything else without the nodes.
It's far more decentralized than any alt.


Neither does gold. Cannot be mined, smelted, guarded, transported etc.

Also don’t forget the reward to miners halvens every four years.

Over its 9 years Bitcoin is the greatest performing currency in history. 
Edit: Oh boy. Is this really being questioned? Up over 70 million percent versus the dollar in 9 years. Almost every year (apart from from just 2015 I think) has seen 5-10x returns.

If you don't see value in Bitcoin - that's your problem. It has censorship-resitance and security that any currency would envy. Maybe you're just into buying coffee though. That's fine.


Hyperbolic bullshit. No one's paying that. Certainly at the moment. Fees at a yearly low. And there's Lightning. I sent 20 bitcoins in November for $9. And I only paid that much to be sure.


I don't know, but it's up and running and the option is there.


That accepts the Bitcoin debit card? Anywhere that accepts debit cards.

The tone was too derisory, as if it were a penny stock - obviously from someone who did not understand the monetary policy and history of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin could crash 100 times over before Timmy reaches 18 and still be far higher than it was 5 years ago or even now - if it's still thriving (and no reason why it shouldn't be).

Depends on the context. "how much bitcoin do you have?" sounds right. Like "how much gold do you have?"

are you serious???
no really... i mean it: did you seriously just compare a controlled money supply with pirated music????
Of course I am. No doubt Governments would love to stop millions of dollars lost due to piracy, but they cannot - once something is in the digital realm it's out there. Especially if like Bitcoin it is peer to peer. You only have to look at non true peer-to-peer examples from both areas like e-gold and Limewire (a company) that were shut down to see that.

Censorship is used in a more general term nowadays. Get with it old timer. 
Why is Bitcoin described as censorship resistant? Was that even answered? Because the blockchain is information. Transactions are entries in the blockchain which cannot be undone or prevented. Transaction of gold is analogous to this.

Of the value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:41:13
Did it even go to 20k except maybe supposedly in Korea which doesn't use USD pairs?
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:24:42
@_date: 2019-06-06 23:28:48
Aren't they regulated now?
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:22:02
I remember Bitcoinity showing this at 10k
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:16:35
Then collapse.
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:36:20
It's fake. Does it rank as any kind of news?
@_date: 2019-10-16 19:29:59


You should do vice versa.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:25:39
To 10x?
@_date: 2019-10-21 05:53:09
And every alt.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:35:59
Once you're in the Bitcoin system you can't be stopped.

NEXT, FIX YOUR CAPS LOCK...
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:20:50
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:48:32
And the price has been rising all year. And the alts?
Can you explain exactly how printing more Tether makes the price of Bitcoin rise?
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:32:35
Not just. Old news.
@_date: 2019-10-29 18:47:50
It's not hindsight. Even ten years ago Hal Finney thought Bitcoin could reach $1 million per unit IF the right conditions were met.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:12:15
Next, sentience. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:59:28
Inaccurate yes, but no question these things are happening faster and faster.
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:22:36
Yes. When most people are using it hopefully.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:37:01
Hospitals? Cost a fortune. Roads? Many have tolls. Schools? Best ones are not cheap.
@_date: 2019-02-08 01:15:35
But these same idiots can use online banking and credit cards payments online? Why shouldn't Bitcoin be as easy to interface? 
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:01:55
There are Amazons and pets.coms in crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:25:30
Not a log chart though.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:47:41
If you looked at the txs for that period mostly it was very large amounts that were being moved on average. People will pay higher fees if sending large amounts because they think it’s worth it. I doubt anyone in his right mind was paying 30-40 dollars to move 50 dollars. I sent far more for 9 dollars in that period. And that was just to be sure. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:25:11
Real money as you call it is not under our control. Bitcoin doesn’t need to go to 100k to work fine anyway. 
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:52:38
We don't want debt in Bitcoin. I meant just for payments.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:05:22
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:04:21
For the price to return above $1000.

Can you make an argument without resorting to juvenile ad hominems? Thanks.
Have you been living in a cave?
@_date: 2019-10-09 05:20:07
It gets off too lightly if anything. Some are regrettably under the illusion that it’s at the very least another flavor of “Bitcoin “. It’s just another alt.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:32:37
So there'll be layers or a Bitcoin 2.0

Seems only like yesterday huh?
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:00:33
Worth it for what?  Unless it’s 2009-10 you won’t get rich. Need to buy at least a 500-1000 as an investment of some sort.
@_date: 2019-10-14 05:33:48
Like gold?
No one wants money that has not been produced spontaneously (alts).
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:57:33
At least your original investment. Anything less is stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:30:37
You mean it was seized? Well, there you go. Try seizing Bitcoin that has been rigorously secured.
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:57:06
Sure. If he wants to play with it and grasp the idea of sending value without a middleman $10 is fine.

And you have a crystal ball? Stop giving trading advice.
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:08:22
It’s no good the tech being decentralized if the protocol can be changed, txs can be rolled back, or if it’s under the control/being marketed by one or two people, etc.

Obviously the point is that even in a "weakened" state Bitcoin is still better than some national currencies. If you want to compare it to the dollar however let's zoom out.

Except Bitcoin has been behaving like this for years. And you refuse to answer why it doesn’t affect the alts in the same way.
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:52:56
On what grounds? Gold has a precedent. 
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:59:21

IF Satoshi is alive and IF the coins haven't been lost why would he undo his work of distancing himself from Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:57:46
Not to mention it hasn't earned its value the way Bitcoin has. It's still wildly overpriced.

You mean do my best to toe the line and declare a certain shitcoin the second coming? And shut up about calling out any rampant shilling?
No, I will not be doing that. 
There's no question it gets far more coverage than it should for an alt with its low market cap and small user base.
Plus I will defend Lightning, the mere mention of which there gets jeered at and downvoted. Mostly by bagholders of payment network shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:27:00

The block size was far more controversial. It would have made Bitcoin just that bit more less secure. Blocks would need to be far bigger than 8 mb to be much good anyway. I don’t see who would mind anonymity except governments. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:37:45
So why hasn’t Tether done the same for the alts? And Bitcoin has been rising all year. More likely institutional buying and Chinese restrictions on transferring money abroad are responsible.

It wasn’t for this reason.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:39:55
I'm talking about the average person who buys some coins, then sees the price fall a few dollars, panic sells, then buys back in at a higher price. Usually only in a bubble is the price constantly rising. If you don't what you are doing either don't buy at all or hold. If you can take a quick profit great. But as the post above says don't be like Greg. Always hold some at least.

Ha. Bitcoin is probably the best investment in history. Look at the all time charts. 
It means a great being first. It is the only coin that was initiated with 0 hype and without anyone expecting it could go anywhere. It had to earn its value the hard way. It took a few years to get to a dollar for example. A shitcoin can do that in a few days now - because everyone expects it. So basically they are scams to enrich their creators.

Uh, right. Pre-mined you. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:20:39
So explain exactly how it works. It sounds like bullshit. Tether even runs on a Bitcoin layer.
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:20:27
That could have been 200,000, now worth 235,500.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:33:17
Perhaps temporary while they check what made that other machine spit out cash.

Either you printed it in reverse or the software flipped the photo.

No. The frog panic sold at 11000 and never got back in.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:36:52
A lot of people want to get rich quick. It’s possible to make a profit eventually even buying at 20K but people don’t want to wait that long and will anguish over not buying it cheaper. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 14:39:30
You’re supposed to buy the dip in a bull market. Anyway if they were dips why didn’t you sell as soon as it went back up again?

Oh, excuse me.




Bitcoin never was supposed to replace mortgages and loans. It has enough on its plate. (Although perhaps somehow will create a layer for this?) However, I'm arguing with the great returns it is capable of producing, buying at a good time and holding for a long time and you won't need loans and mortgages. Sounds too simple doesn't it? Holding is not easy. You buy at 9K and it drops to 7 do you keep holding? Or buy more? It goes to 12K you take the gains now? There's a risk but long term Bitcoin has proven itself.


I'm not sure why you've chosen to concentrate on the phone example. I wouldn't buy the phone with that money in their position (or ask the parents just fr the money), I would buy Bitcoin and hold it for 5+ years as I've already stated.


Then perhaps people will stop buying stuff they don't need. And not get into debt.


That's because at present they are using a money that loses value long term. We have no control over the money.


My "interlocutor" started being obnoxious so I won't be re-reading anything by him. I addressed his points anyway. Once is enough.
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:10:57
So use a licensed insured exchange.
@_date: 2019-02-17 16:20:52

@_date: 2019-06-22 00:28:20
Why are these kind of posts always popular? You never see "I just bought $100,000 worth of Bitcoin".
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:56:01
All the worse.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:40:41
So buy more at 3k. If you’re buying at 20k you’re probably fomoing anyway or buying a small amount using DCA.
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:29:45


You cannot ban the use of the Bitcoin network. Just as they've failed miserably at stopping BitTorrent piracy. Only exchanges.


No. You must have dreamt this.
@_date: 2019-02-01 01:28:30
Problem is the "was" bit.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:06:20
There's no whatever. If you'd bought BTC a year again rather than ETH you'd be better off.

You still have to store the gold safely, transport it etc.
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:18:29
Doesn't mean you need to go all in.

@_date: 2019-02-05 15:04:28
And the money.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:19:37
It can't compete with Bitcoin's censorship resistance, the complete control you have over your money.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:40:33
Bitcoin started the last bull run in 2015, not the alts. And even in 2017 I remember it going to 7K while ETH was stuck at 300. Anyway it's easier to 10x when you are starting in single or double figures.
Not that the markets tell the whole story.
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:50:43
I’ve seen the same. This one. Numerous times.

Hey, there's no need to be a fucking prick. We were just talking.
And if you want to throw your money at a cutthroat bank that's your problem. If you've been paying a mortgage for the last few years work out how much you would have gained DCA-ing Bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:56:44

gold and most other metals have practical applications in things we use in our every day lives.
what practical application does bitcoin have other than a massive energy hog?
ask AAPL the monetary value of the metals used in EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE of their devices....
ask HOV the monetary value of the metals used in EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE of their homes....
ask GM the monetary value of the metals used in EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE of their cars....
etc ad nauseam.
These are not monetary characteristics. Most precious metals are collecting dust. 


That's your assertion it's an energy hog. Christmas lights, ACs, unnecessary car journeys, heated swimming pools etc are not energy hogs? Bitcoin uses over 70% renewable energy anyway. Who else would love free electricity more than miners?


The genie is out of the bottle. It will happen one way or another. Just as it's out for the ability to pirate music. That will never be stopped now.

@_date: 2019-06-03 09:33:48
Maybe not the central banks but if you store your money in the Bitcoin system instead of in a bank account there’s bugger all the latter can do.

That’s why some of them are rare. Comic books especially were not valued when they first saw print. Most were thrown out.

There are fewer coins in circulation now if anything anyway.

Why on Earth not? And you could use a sidechain anyway. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:47:36
Oh, bitchy. Not only not needed but it looked like it was pointing to something else. So confusing also.
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:18:07
You have 4 subscribers, though.
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:50:51
It’s never mentioned that the average value sent then was about $140,000. 
Yeah I know that you don’t need a big fee for a big amount but this figure above does make a difference. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:24:45
And you get a money that governments cannot seize or stop. That's a utility. Banning exchanges would only help to justify its existence.


If you buy and send $10 in Bitcoin to someone it doesn't matter if you bought it at $100 or $10000.
@_date: 2019-02-11 14:41:36
It’s not completely. Or it wouldn’t still be in the thousands. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:54:32
Of course they'd be useful - even more so since txs cannot be stopped. And a mixing service could be used for anonymity.

@_date: 2019-06-16 01:33:39
Dominance high too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:13:15
You’re right. Let’s call it bcash. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:22:45
Yes we need something like this but perhaps with a few numbers included to stop sending to the wrong joe stevens. So, joestevens or something.

Or have money to spare. Even true believers cannot always buy.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:04:22
It was a gag.
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:51:55
You kidding? Banning drugs and alcohol only made them more desirable and far more expensive. 
China banning Bitcoin made the price tank or it was whales selling off during the news to scare weak hands?
A month ago U.S. Congressman Bradley Sherman suggested banning Bitcoin. Since then the price nearly doubled. 
If the government is trying to ban txs of any kind it gives more of a reason for Bitcoin’s existence.
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:04:52
But they should support censorship resistance.
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:16:04
Tell them to be less obsessed with the exchange rate?
By the time of any major adoption Bitcoin would need a far bigger market cap and would then be less voaltile.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:55:18
You don’t seem serious. But if so... 
How long was it at 20k? A few minutes or hours? You were unlucky. 
And didn’t decide to sell at 19 or 18k and cut your losses?

For Bitcoin everything for an alt trying to be cash nothing.

Problem with people like you is you think just because the US is strong now (although horribly in debt) you think it will last forever. 
And economics is not a science in the way physics etc.  is.

You go learn to be less arrogant and patronizing. 
20 years? Really?
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:03:56
That’s not holding. The whole point of Bitcoin is you don’t depend on third parties.

Maybe because too many were sure we were going to 5K.
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:52:13
Even if it were any good it would only give more credibility to Bitcoin.

Don’t forget banning something can make it more valuable. Look at drugs.

It doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the same as Bitcoin. It took BTC years to reach above $100. It earned it the hard way.
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:53:23
Yes I remember this being posted at least twice last week or so.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:13:43
But long term?
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:46:10
The only advantage is that it will be coins with no history.
@_date: 2019-02-17 16:22:10
Which is why they're worth the same and fungible with Bitcoin. Oh...
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:57:13
There have been plenty of posts like this over the years.

What’s that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:54:45
It doesn't explain how the coins were accessed? Maybe a deal was done or the owner was incompetent. Use multisig, timelock etc and even if they beat the shit out of you they can't get it.

No they're not. If it were easy to transport you could do it yourself.

People who have sold in similar past scenarios have ended up regretting it. Someone has to hold anyway or it goes to zero.
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:12:02
No. But it still would be called a crypto.

We don't.

@_date: 2019-06-28 03:22:01
Tether is not Bitcoin. And there are replica and fake artworks. 
To say it’s all speculation is nonsense. Many like having complete control over their money. And so what if it attracts investors. Wtf is wrong with that? If it helps adoption all the better. It can’t be forced on people like fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:14:22

Sounds defeatist. Your strongest currency has lost several thousand per cent against Bitcoin even since 2013.
Bitcoin will itself do what it needs to do. It's siphoning off value from other assets. Empires don't last forever.

Anonymity can be brought into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 16:24:19
Dollars etc had their value decreed by the government. Bitcoin had to earn its value despite not being legal tender etc. And proof of work ensures Bitcoin is not created out of nothing or easily.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:27:35
A few cents to a few dollars is outrageous? Anyway he doesn't want Segwit which you bring lower fees.

@_date: 2019-06-04 18:18:33
Person to person it wouldn't matter. Few companies accept cryptocurrencies at present anyway.
You're ignoring the fact that most people use Bitcoin as a hedge anyway not for buying stuff.

Only Mark and others' pockets will be lined.

@_date: 2019-02-17 16:28:13
That's alright. Bitcoin doesn't care about @_date: 2019-02-08 22:16:14
That wouldn't do it.

It will teach you not to leave your keys with a(n unlicensed, uninsured) third party.


You're overstating the case. Use a Trezor with recovery seed backed up or use multisig.

@_date: 2019-02-11 15:32:24
Define using it.
Circumventing government restrictions, preventing seizure or as hedge against fiat currency is not using it?
@_date: 2019-02-17 16:18:46
Chill out. Maybe you should try being a Bitcoin person.
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:17:24


Those seem like social media things.
Crypto has wifi, 4G, smartphones already in place to utilise at least not just slow modems.
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:18:49


Whatever that means.
What has the all time high to do with it? I said all time charts. Are you a dumb fuck?
Everyone wants to get rich quick? So why weren't they doing that 2009-2012? You've just proved my point. People now buy because they know it has proved itself and know that the supply is fixed and the issuance deflationary and it has lasted 10 years. Meanwhile you haven't really addressed what I said in the 2nd paragraph so I don't know why I'm bothering.
@_date: 2019-02-17 18:08:25
Zero correlation? So what else can you bas future trends on? Anyway of course it isn’t certain. These charts deal with probabilities. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 22:10:23


And even that might not do it some day.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:36:33

Kill off the alts. Somehow. There will always be people who think Bitcoin can just be copied and the copy will be valid (it won’t be). This confusion doesn’t help though. Not to mention most of them being scams.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:20:20
You think the top is in when the public hasn’t even gotten involved yet?

Not just what makes Bitcoin better.


Will they even know they are using a crypto?


Here you could be right. But for other reasons.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:52:32
It is quite normal. But it isn’t intrinsic to Bitcoin. The market cap is still tiny and therefore easily moved.
@_date: 2019-02-09 11:02:18
No idea what either of you are on about. The price of the alts is up also. Vs the dollar or Bitcoin. That’s indisputable. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:11:58
That does not make it Bitcoin. It’s not fungible with Bitcoin, it doesn’t have the developers, it doesn’t have the infrastructure or liquidity etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:19:18
It’s better than gold though. Better to go after that market then. Not payments.

The bank or government can seize your money or stop a transaction. They know how much you have and what you spend it on. The central banks debase the currency meanwhile.

For SegWit2x futures anyway.

How many people are drug dealers? The government won't care enough if you have a few million dollars worth of Bitcoin. But having that in a bank account might draw suspicion of money laundering. Someone could be in debt and have their bank assets seized.
You don't have to have broken a (serious) law.
Sure, there's some chance your Bitcoins can be seized if you're not careful, but your bank assets and gold can be seized or transactions stopped far more easily.

The whole fear and loathing over fees strikes me as being manufactured.
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:42:20
You can say that again.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:57:14
Yes. But be careful with the term printing money.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:02:58
You have to ask why it has gone down this route anyway. People at the moment are clearly still happy enough with the likes of Visa and MasterCard. 
Bitcoin has to bring more to the table. A lot more. Lightning hopefully the solution. 
It’s certainly not bch. A bit faster and cheaper doesn’t cut it (especially if marginally less secure and decentralised). 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:32:46
Well, none of the other cryptos are any easier. At least Bitcoin has more of an infrastructure.

Because some want the price to drop to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:57:22


Not because of the fees. No one wants to spend an appreciating currency. They're all the same.
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:21:36
Why would you buy it when it’s free to Bitcoin owners?

Lose how? By buying high and selling low? If you're worried by that use DCA-ing as a few here suggest.

No. If the price is rising that's a sign of adoption and trust in the technology. The price needs to rise for it be of any serious use anyway.

@_date: 2019-06-23 02:46:26
They didn’t give a date. Lawsuits and accusations of insider trading ensued. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:01:03
Then defeat the altcoins. A cunning plan.
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:57:40
They themselves sell refurbished stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:44:24
No guarantee two chains would have survived. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:13:45
Better than gold, though.
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:05:33
So's gold.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:49:13
Perhaps not but it is.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:41:44
bitcoin.org comes up first for me.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:33:08


Not to mention BTG.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:00:26
It's completely censored here, didn't you know? /s
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:16:38
Can't you treat it like a fraud-resistant currency?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:10:10
Deflationary, mined, limited and diminishing supply. Of course he did. It’s nothing like cash anyway. 
I see I’m being downvoted by the rbtc crowd 
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:19:18
Okay. Should sell enough to cover your original investment anyway at least.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:23:15
i.e. he fucked up.
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:40:09
Indeed. His tweet could've been seen as positive for Bitcoin anyway. A threat to the status quo. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:18:18
.org addresses are the only ones that matter in this case.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:04:50
Centralised and just as prone to scaling problems as we see during ICO launches. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:37:41
Do you understand Bitcoin and all the coins are experimental software? That such things happens is not a surprise. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:33:08
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:18:40
Hee probably sold his BCH for BTC at 2800.
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:56:44
Or vice versa.
@_date: 2019-02-21 18:58:47
Who has the staying power though?

Quadriga was basically a bank also. Keep your own keys. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:39:28
A new coin taking off won't happen, because of the network effect, and even if there were a chance people would always  wonder what's to stop the challenger also being replaced.

Lambo? I thought this was an ETH thing?

Don’t be so sure.

It might crash leaving with just one million dollars?
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:00:43
I think they would prefer credit cards anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:48:16
Better. But “USD for a” overkill.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:22:04
When he was starting on Facebook though. He wasn't just clowning around at a frat party.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:09:02


If anything.
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:02:09
Not at all. If we've reached the bottom anything after that is a bull market.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:50:31


You mean you can't? That's highly debatable. Anyway it still could be used as an offshore account. Bitcoin was designed to be unstoppable so banning won't make much difference. You're not considering its use on the black market. You think they would care it's illegal?
Piracy is illegal but it's thriving.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:23:28
Which you neglected to invest in.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:19:19
Because BCH isn't really doing anything that Bitcoin can.
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:17:35
You lose any fiat they have also.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:32:11
You really just look for old memes to repost?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:14:17
Nor censorship resistant though is it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:48:02
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:23:13
Because the price is manipulated. In a way Bitcoin can't.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:07:45
Or you could present a counter argument.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:39:41
No need to be snooty about the newer comers. The early miners were taking very little risk.

A weighty tome.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:10:57
No, much worse. Look at the charts for last two or three years.

Did he say that?
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:54:22
In a few years you’ll be called lucky.

Or use Segwit or stop being a cheapskate.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:48:21
Just traders trading.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:51:39
Well, at least it should hold its value at the very least.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:14:19
Still gone up over 10x in a year. And far from nothing. 70x is doable. There’s nothing technically to stop it from happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:33:33
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:30:34
They outperformed btc like in the past though. Maybe because the main ones are in triple figures now.
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:02:18
It's often about the falling price.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:32:41
Nor do I. Making money from Bitcoin a no brainer though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:06:02
I call it bgold. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:48:16
After, perhaps, will go down. Briefly anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:37:14
Of course there are ups and downs, that's why most people are advised to hold rather than trade. From 0 to $7600 doesn't convince you it's going up longterm? What will?

You’re joking. A grandma or a baby can use the iOS. If anyone cannot then they are beyond help. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:21:21
Problem is blocks would have to be a whole lot larger for BCH or BTC to compete with the likes of Visa.

You said it there. It's not ready yet for that. And same goes for alts.

No, let’s not. He disappeared for a reason. So that one person one not appear to be in control. Enough of the hero worshipping. The community only matters. 
If Satoshi wants adulation then let him reveal his identity.

Just blurb. So if you want it to be like cash make the supply unlimited, completely anonymous and fungible. It’s none of these things. 
Here he is comparing with gold:
It’s even in the white paper:
“The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.”
Edited 2nd sentence for clarity.

People making lots of money off Bitcoin can afford it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:39:47
Where did I say it had to have high transaction fees?  It started by someone being sniffy about it being a mere store of value. 
If physical at least, cash has NO fees, is not limited in supply and completely fungible and anonymous. So despite the subtitle it doesn’t quite achieve these aims. 
Nobody wants small blocks but not at a price (less secure or less decentralised). 
Segwit and lightning will bring cheaper faster fees - but some don’t want that,  which makes you wonder if they want Satoshi’s vision or just 9 year old software. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:29:56

They muck about with it too much and promise too much. Also too centralized.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:02:30

Doing more is not enough. Not if the monetary supply of the alt can be changed or if it's too centralized because it was created after people saw Bitcoin was workable and therefore the creators etc seized control too early.

It costs nothing to switch between social networks. This analogy should be shot and buried.
And BTC has more than just being first going for it. It's the most liquid for example.
@_date: 2019-02-17 22:07:32
His old post he links to is rather telling also.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:40:49
That's less than 10x, and with a halving on the way.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:21:49


Why not use some other precious instead of gold? Some are rarer, many are more useful.
A newer coin will despite its best attempts be more centralized than Bitcoin because BTC started from zero in price and expectation. Now every "serious" crypto creator assumes his coin will go to a dollar at least and therefore seeks to control and market it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:55:21


Bitcoin is so divisible it doesn't need this from Litecoin.

It's designed to be a deflationary currency. It will go up. Halving every four years and a limited supply see to that. Not to mention inflation suffered by fiat currencies.

Your only concern should be accruing as many coins as possible. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:07:05
Gold is fine but it’s very hard to buy and sell whilst having complete ownership. Everything is going digital and online. Newer generations will think gold antiquated as a SoV or investment.

The price of gold is artificially kept in check which would suggest it’s manipulated.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:22:12
It's on an upward trajectory longterm regardless of crashes or corrections. Anyone can see that. If it can go up ten times in a year why not go up another ten times in the future?

It can be done away with again though. Bitcoin's "gold standard" is permanent.
@_date: 2019-02-17 20:19:04
It certainly can replace some traditional financial services. Thinking it will have no affect is short sighted.

You're not thinking hard enough.

No it hasn’t. Barely any headlines like the last time. This is institutional buying. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 19:03:41
Even if the gold standard were still being used the fact that it could be stopped at any time is a reason to worry. Bitcoin has a perpetual "gold standard".

Purely for trading. Obviously you want something pegged to fiat currencies.

You've been answering a similar post I made. You know perfectly well where. Your point about electricity and the internet is so fanciful as to be ludicrous. What if gold could suddenly be synthesized you might as well argue.

Over transaction speeds? Did you learn nothing in the last year? Investors value Bitcoin for its security, censorship resistance and network effect and no alt can compete with these things.

No, it needs to dies. It and all the alts.

You're a rbtc user... There's surprise.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:19:48
That was supposed to "haven't" by the way. 
And can't you start an argument without calling the other party delusional? Just make your point.
Many here, especially the Bitcoin-is-only-a-currency crowd, forget Bitcoin is also a store of value. It's your own Swiss bank. Perhaps many people believe their money will be safe from governments or anyone else seizing it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:38:37
Perhaps. I think we'll be seeing $1000 rises on some days in the future. And drops.
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:14:52
Like gold?
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:22:08


Fiat currencies.
Anything you can't buy with fiat or credit cards.
Name 3 practical things you can purchase with gold on February 4th 2019. 
Or name anything you buy with Euros in the US?

@_date: 2017-11-26 14:18:23
I'd be happy with it as a gold substitute.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:47:56

Monetarily it isn’t. And that’s what matters.

You may not be able to thrive if Bitcoin were banned but others would.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:57:42
Peak surely, not a trough.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:45:02
Because we’ve seen it before. Plus it’s immutably limited supply and deflationary nature.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:02:12
You don't mention bcash was created in the confusion during the Segwit2X fail. Or that Bitmain wanted their juicy fees that Segwit would deny them.


Please. We have Litecoin in that unlikely event. Bcash is an out and out scam. All alts are really to some degree.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:13:34
Only? If things had been quiet in the Bitcoin world...
@_date: 2019-10-28 22:30:32
Not now with rising house prices and mortgage rates. Cheaper to rent. So no, I don't agree. Put 5 grand in Bitcoin for 5+ years and you won't need a mortgage.

Secondary interest should be "trying to destroy Bitcoin", followed by "ripping off people".

I bought some at 180 in April 2013. Then it went to 266 and crashed to 60.  I held anyway. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 01:02:35
This if somehow successful would only give Bitcoin more credibility. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:30:53
Even if a gold standard is brought back it can always be done away with again. Bitcoin is on an eternal "gold" standard.

It's not mentioned in the white paper interestingly.

Yeah, blame auto correct. ;-)

I wouldn't be using Coinbase myself anyway on moral grounds, because they're partly responsible for this. Exchanges can lose your money anyway. Sure, if Trezor have a way of splitting the coins and you can get one that would be preferable.

He was the chosen one but turned evil.
@_date: 2019-12-29 19:36:45
Of course. Used a middleman and not sending the actual asset or its keys.

I don't think you should be storing all your BTC funds on your phone. A few dollars worth maybe. It's hardly Bitcoin's fault.
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:13:44
Even Satoshi thought scaling would take years.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:55:00
So why did he model it on gold?
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:07:43
Longer term Bitcoin is unquestionably a better investment. Most timeframes are in its favor. Including YTD.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:43:02
Fewer weak hands and swindlers in it now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:22:07

@_date: 2019-12-03 16:22:53
No one held the altcoins which is why they dropped in value so much even vs Bitcoin. Holding is important for the Bitcoin economy. And holders are rewarded in the long run.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:19:17


I heard that before the last halving. It would be much higher than 7k if it were priced in.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:14:59
The bitcoin supply halved a year ago.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:51:21
Also in the white paper:
“The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.”
I don’t care what the title said anyway. If it quacks like a duck etc. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:16:24

BTC has too much of foothold though. BCH can try but it’s doomed to be another alt. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:45:02
Well, almost no one accepts gold as a form of payment in shops. Certainly not online.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:18:29

By "using" you mean transacting.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:42:50
Somewhere in between the two might be ideal, not right after one or before the other.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:05:10
I'm neither surprised nor care.
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:25:51
Well, Bitcoin needs further adoption first anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:58:21
Bitcoin has first mover advantage and most of the industry behind it. Cloning Bitcoin does not make another Bitcoin, never mind a better one.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:04:44

@_date: 2017-11-02 14:42:53
So can buy more. Great.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:19:37
Because it was an unplanned contentious fork. It's an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:14:27
Bitcoin neglected to buy you did.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:01:37
Yeah, I had bought some. Will sell when it goes up a bit now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:18:31
It's besides the point. I didn't say Satoshi tried to ape gold in every way imaginable. Just as a store of value obviously. You're going off in other directions.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:12:36


Unlikely in the extreme.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:12:48
So why didn’t Satoshi start off with bigger blocks?
@_date: 2015-07-25 00:26:07
Mass adoption, if it happens, will be the very last stage. Bitcoin's success is not dependent on it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:53:52
As if he's under any obligation to meet the condition.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:26:31
Too late maybe.

Bitcoin is paired with every other crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:59:08
They could accept 0 confirmations just to get the ball rolling.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:14:41
It’s an altcoin. It doesn’t have Bitcoin’s infrastructure, liquidity, trust, developers etc etc. Crying over it being called bcash is petty, as Ver showed recently when he flipped an interviewer on a podcast. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 03:29:14
We just need a few billionaires interested.

It's not how gold is transported because it's too expensive, too much trouble, and too slow. Not a problem for Bitcoin though.

@_date: 2019-12-29 06:36:35
If people have to pay they’ll pay. Bitcoin just seems expensive because of all these cheap alts which make trade offs. Compared to moving gold it’s a steal.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:57:32
It’s more stable because its market cap is much bigger. The volatility is not intrinsic to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:11:18
Are you saying Bitcoin has not been a better investment?
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:13:52

@_date: 2019-12-03 16:27:00
Altcoins are too centralised since they were created after in the knowledge that Bitcoin was workable. And really they are just another fiat - an attempt to print more money. Not one of them improves on what Bitcoin brought - censorship resistant store of value.
Alts are like other metals competing with gold.
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:37:38
They just put that in advertising for legal reasons. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:26:08
It has unique qualities but there are far more useful metals.
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:55:12
You would be equally foolish to be certain that because something has been around for a long time this will continue.
Gold will always have a place but so will horses - but they are nowhere as indispensable as they used to be.

@_date: 2017-11-11 01:20:34
Only one of them has the liquidity and infrastructure etc. Bitcoin is paired with almost every alt, for example. BCH no.

And modest. ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:00:18
It's the miners I was talking about. Although it wasn't necessary to invest a lot. Some got lucky/saw the potential and bought a few thousand coins with $20.
No need for the "bullshit", btw. Just make your point.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:43:25
It won't be priced in really.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:30:52
We and scammers?
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:46:32
The dollar.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:13:42
Controversial post I see. Funny. At near $10,000 and some are still skeptical.

Waterford is in Ireland.
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:54:11
Better than losing it to 90% drops in value - even in value vs Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-09 11:17:36
Especially with the shitcoins rallying too. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:49:12
I didn’t say I could time it. 
So $200 to $1,200 in 2015-16 was not a bull market?
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:50:03
You can pay tolls for roads. Preferably using autonomous payment systems. There’s no need for taxes. You’re the one living in the woods, luddite.

Bitcoin is harder to seize and no relying on someone else.

Which is illegal.


If they did they shouldn't have to worry about it being seized.
@_date: 2019-06-08 03:09:57
Ten year bull market.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:32:40
It didn't happen though did it? Because the consensus wasn't there. So Ver and Wu decided to pump BCH.
A slightly faster Bitcoin won't cause Visa to lose any sleep. Only lightning will do that or another solution. BCH is no better than Litecoin.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:35:08
So long? Patience. Gold took thousands of years. And still not everyone uses it as a store of value.

7 years. 
MtGox only - and that was because it was by far the biggest exchange at the time. 
News may move a price briefly but in a bull or bear market it does its own thing. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 01:22:26
And you don't think that will be solved within 20 years? Anyway, it works the other way. Having completely unseizable money is highly appealing.
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:11:55
And get shafted.

It's still the dominant coin, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:48:10
Folks mostly care about it being un-seizable and deflationary. Most don't care about fees and so on despite the FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:39:56
To be fair it's probably not their aim.
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:12:13

There are insured exchanges. 
@_date: 2019-12-31 01:59:38
Which implies you don’t think it will rise, therefore it will.

Yes, r/personalfinance, which you frequent.
And posts from your type (fiat apologists always get upvoted on here somehow) contain the usual guff:
This sub is delusional and banks are cool.
They should be afraid of Bitcoin. People can not only use it as a currency but as a bank. And one that cannot seize your money or freeze txs.
And normal banks *are* phasing out large denomination banknotes.

There's third party risk though.

@_date: 2019-12-21 02:24:18
Merely a matter of timing. Bitcoin still up 70-80% this year.
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:01:54

Because it promises more than it can deliver. It has no monetary policy. It was pre-mined. It's centralized and not censorship resistant as the DAO showed.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:27:10
They are not his links. Unless it's another account.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:26:59
Woah there. It's still in development. And strictly speaking it doesn't have a blockchain - a term that's been around for years anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-06 19:05:59
This wouldn't drive the price back to 20k.

You'd think the guy from AU would.

@_date: 2015-07-12 14:54:42
It always finishes higher than it was.  Even after a crash. Higher price = higher adoption. 
@_date: 2019-04-26 04:54:05
People dump because price falls not because of news.
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:49:17
Won't find out elsewhere?
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:19:41
Of course it can survive, as can be seen by its price and hash rate etc but that doesn't make scams all right.
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:09:13
Fuck that.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:27:52
I'd rather a dozen billionaires were interested than the general public. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:32:24
It had two bubbles.
@_date: 2019-04-26 02:18:04
Not really. Why should Bitcoin care?
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:04:44
So $200 to $1200 in 2015-16 wasn't a bull run?
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:31:40
New account too. You might be right. Although little sympathy for his target either.
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:57:52
I’d prefer that to paying taxes. Not everyone orders stuff online. 
Perhaps if they stopped funding wars they would have plenty of money for sidewalks.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:11:56
And $200 for most of 2015. So?
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:56:20
Are you American or not?
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:14:11
So plenty of room to grow.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:16:00
They are all scams.
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:02:09
If the real bottom comes looks like it will have to be soon.
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:41:23
Just need some billionaires interested.
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:03:34
That was advice to buy at e.g. 166 and sell at 300. Not a promise that it's going to the moon.

You can buy fiat with it. Eventually.

Trump probably would since Wikileaks helped him get to the White House.
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:32:56
Because Bitcoin is the only crypto that started from 0 without any expectations or hopes. No one hoarded it then, even its creator apparently, expecting it to go to one dollar and beyond. Its issuance was completely fair. You can't replicate that. Now a shitcoin can go to one dollar in a few hours. Bitcoin took years to do that. So the alts are too centralised also as a result.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:35:13
Perhaps says more about you.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:28:11
All the trash up also. This won’t last.

I see your point but maybe he has many of them.

Again with the MySpace analogy. First it's a false analogy. Social networks can be used without financial risk. And second Bitcoin is still currently the king of cryptos.

No shit?

Bitcoin is not a payment network. It's for settlements and a store of value. Layers are better suited for payments.
Fiat is sent using IOUs via a middleman and alts are sent using trade offs and can't keep value.
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:34:52

you're being silly. Of course it's predictive and deals with probabilities.
A simple example is an asset plummeting on a chart. You naturally assume it will continue.


Bitcoin has a limited supply and is deflationary however. Not to mention being the world's first and best censorship resistant store of value. You ignore the first ten years of its price uptrend at your peril.
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:54:37

They were at 30-50 dollars at their height in December 2017 but that was people sending hundreds of thousands of dollars. I know the amount sent shouldn't matter but perhaps they thought it was worth it.
The gold or aluminium part was an analogy. Just because something might be cheaper to send doesn't necessarily make it more useful or valuable. How secure/decentralized/immutable/not prone to 51% attacks is Nano or Litecoin for example?

Bitcoins code can be replicated. Not the network. Its the network thats real.
Bitcoin solved the double spend problem in computer science.
Nor can the integrity of its monetary policy or the fairness of its distribution.
No one then knew it would amount to much. Now every shitcoin can hot a dollar in days. And is centralised by its creators because of this.
A good analogy would be Action Comics No. 1 from 1939 (first appearance of Superman) compared to Action Comics No. 1 vol 2 from 2011. No doubt everyone bought the second one thinking it would rise in value.
The 1939 version ended up mostly in the trash or was not well cared for and so is very rare - especially in good condition. And is very valuable.

"Banned" is not the right word. They would be withdrawn from circulation not banned per se.

Good news but not very big. No one's going to buy bitcoins just to buy stuff on Steam.

They are all scams including ones without the Bitcoin name. There's no good reason for them to exist except to fill the pockets of their creators. Maybe XMR, Litecoin and one or two others are justified. For now.

Better tech will not be enough to usurp Bitcoin. It's not just tech that has Bitcoin where it is now. And Bitcoin is better tech than gold, does that mean it will supplant gold?

Bitcoin had low volatility in most of 2015. So not that unusual. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:26:59

You have a point. Most predicting future high valuations were mocked also.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:37:49
It’s not a question of what is fake or not. Would you like if they released your emails and then hampered your life?  Not everything needs to be made public. Also why a supposed liberal would want a demagogue in power in the US is mystifying.
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:36:09
Bitcoin has the network effect and better liquidity. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:57:22
You think the banks have say in the matter?
And cash is used much more for money laundering.
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:03:29
You’re the one who must be new. No sensible Bitcoin user would be digging out their hardware wallet to sell coins because Bitfinex was doing something shady. News doesn’t drive markets. There was tons of bad news in 2017. It didn’t matter.

It only deals with probabilities not certainties which perhaps you assume. 
If you look at a chart and see the price falling do you assume it will keep falling? I’ll bet you do. So even you will try to interpret a chart.

It helps obviously. And not just one person doing it of course.
There's no demand for your toenails. They are not rare or fungible or easily verifiable, nor can be transferred over the internet (and without being seized).

@_date: 2016-09-19 19:25:55
I'd rather the "stubborn" developers got it right instead of rushing it. Bitcoin is far from ready for mainstream use in other respects anyway so I don't see the hurry.

Buying above 15k is what made people lose a lot of money.

Must why it has fallen several million per cent vs Bitcoin in 10 years. 
FrankerZ_123 is a lousy trader and is blaming Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:04:14
There will be only 21 million so that’s arguable.

I can see that you picking a time frame of an asset right after a bubble burst. Zoom out.

Isn't it supposed to go to either 0 or an astronomical figure? I think 0 is out.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:24:08


Even in the crypto winter of 2015 there were buyers.


What does that mean?


The reward has been reduced anyway. 
What are you saying anyway? That it's going to zero? Give me a break.
There will always be people who think it will be of much greater value in the future. It will only drop so much.

@_date: 2018-11-27 21:08:38
In the following post I then said: "There will always some demand for Bitcoin and always be some who will never sell low."
I thought it was a given there would be some demand for the best existing way yet of storing and transferring value without a third party, but since you are so anal, let's say we stick to just "some will never sell" - every copy of Action Comics No. 1 or every Rembrandt is owned by someone. Does this mean there are potentially worth zero?

If you're storing value in it it's replacing a bank. Of course it's not a bank in the traditional sense. The energy secures the network. It's not being wasted. How much money do banks waste securing their cash, gold etc?

You’ll notice it was a question, looking for clarification. I didn’t say you made the point. 
You say critical thinking all I see is you bitching on every positive post about Bitcoin. 
It’s true. You don’t know what to say. Maybe you should just shut up. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:05:36
Might not go that low but percentage wise it would be in line with the last crash. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:25:26
Yes, holders are the pillars of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:47:48
As happened in 2015. Oh.
There will always be people who have the balls to buy some.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:28:43
You cropped the part that shows Bitcoin dominance at 54%. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:15:18
Calm down. The asset was wildly overbought by Joe Average. It's not Bitcoin's fault many suck at trading.

He has more balls than you apparently. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:02:39
What does it matter what it costs? That's a problem for the miners. The question is it done in a sufficiently or reasonably green way. Although why Bitcoin gets so much grief when people  probably waste a lot more energy playing graphics intensive videos games.

4 days is nothing. It was rising for over two years anyway before the crash. 6000% at least.
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:12:20
Well done! You seem to know what you're getting into so don't be fazed if the price drops more. Maybe reserve fiat to get more if it does?
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:27:26

Is that the best you can do? A one in a million chance and something we cannot control. We cannot stop lightning hitting people, we can improve money.


Then your understanding of Bitcoin is minimal. It can be sent to anywhere at any time to anyone. Other examples of ineptitudes in the current system: a bank site may be closed for maintenance in the early hours, and I've been told that Brazil ATMS close at 10pm because of fear of criminals coercing customers to withdraw their money.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:16:49
I didn't say it increases value but it mitigates further depreciation of the price.
I explained why there would be demand - it's the only way or the best way yet of securing or sending value without a middleman. That's a utility worth something. Plus it's deflationary or it will be in the future.
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:46:12
I meant on here. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:37:14
...at the height of a bubble. Many have done well. I'm just wondering what you are doing here anyway?
@_date: 2018-11-19 03:07:45
Had a halving then, though.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:46:40
Like from $30 to $2. This analogy is falling apart.
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:50:07
Meanwhile BTC dominance at 44%
@_date: 2016-09-25 00:13:45
Well, it's not as if folks can't find out what they need to in other subs on this site.
@_date: 2018-11-09 16:54:36

Who gives a shit? Who accepts gold?
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:19:14
The last bull run was very prolonged though. I couldn’t believe it was lasting so long. So perhaps now is a protracted “deflation” or cooling off. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 22:57:51
Are you implying emails can send parcels? Obviously it's posted written correspondence that has suffered.

Past performance no guarantee etc.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:20:45


Rise surely?


God knows. I don't rule out below 3000. But it could be just as easily be above 5K-6K. Although not saying it would stay there. Depends on the ETF etc.
Just know as long as it cannot be debased, and is deflationary there will be other bull markets.
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:28:02
"ICOSs, regulations"

You make it sound like it's the fault of crypto - it's their own fault.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:58:22
I think. It's still a nascent market. Even gold dropped 12% last summer.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:39:47
Lucky you called it. Oh.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:10:03
And what if Facebook shares go to one cent? Don't be daft.
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:29:49


For safeguarding you own money it can more than compete with anything.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:49:19
Who uses gold to buy things? Cash has value because someone (the government has told you it has - hence the word "fiat", by decree). That's not real value. Bitcoin has had to earn it.


Gold dropped 12% in the summer. Shit happens. But at least with gold and Bitcoin the price does not drop because more are produced out of thin air like cash.
@_date: 2018-11-04 22:00:32
Amount of comments matter I think.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:02:30
That's easy to say. You could sell at 6000 then it goes back to 8000 as it did at one point. Then panic buy in again at a loss.
Some of us are in this for the long haul. Anyway I did take some profits in case you're wondering.
@_date: 2018-11-30 01:58:43
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:23:04
It's not unpopular on here.
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:26:41
Like those in 2015?
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:53:46
It will be less inflationary than gold after next halving. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:01:02
How far back does that line go?
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:15:59
It's the much-maligned holders that keep Bitcoin afloat. I doubt it's used very little now for buying drugs anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:43:28
Well if you think I shifted my statement that’s your problem. Perhaps I didn’t make myself clear. Now that I have what’s your argument?
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:49:52
Let's forget the preceding two years you could have taken profits.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:08:18
Cobblers. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:42:02
Looks like a normal part of the cycle to me. So far. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:08:53
You’ll be forever waiting. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:09:56
What has investing got to do with it? Are you talking about the tech or not? Tech-wise Bitcoin can compete with gold even now.
There will be something that replaces email. It will probably be still called email. Just as phones are still phones.There will maybe something in the future called Bitcoin that shares little of the code it presently has. It's just a matter of keeping going. No doubt there will be transitional phases.
Bitcoin is not for you to get rich. It's so you are in charge of your own money.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:44:41
You suggested as much.
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:24:23
If it’s all bought that means it’s highly in demand. Therefore valuable or priceless.

@_date: 2018-11-06 15:22:07
How are they stupid examples? They are obstructions to people accessing their own money.
As for cards they're only good for in person txs or buying on the internet. You cannot use a card to transfer money. Anyway, what have cards to do with what we are talking about? There are Bitcoin debit cards. So what? You just basically saying all these things do what one thing (Bitcoin) can do on its own.
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:24:25
It does because fiat will not go up in value long term.

Shitty traders have only themselves to blame. You don’t know what a pyramid scheme is. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:23:03
I didn't change my argument. You said Bitcoin was just a currency. I said it's more than that. It's your own bank, it's money, it's a network.
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:47:21
Well, it is old. There's a brand new OS and brand new phones. What do you expect Apple to do? This hack above would be above most to accomplish anyway.

Heh, the comments in the 240 USD thread.
@_date: 2016-09-29 19:24:03
Not by itself, no. Bitcoin has to be easier to use. There has to be enough of a reason to ditch your credit card.
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:11:06
A few have said it - if you're happy with Bitcoin as a gold substitute and not another Visa.
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:36:58
Get back your original investment at the very least.
@_date: 2016-09-17 12:35:31
If you keep it as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:56:27
How likely is that. Ask yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:36:41
It would be less than it was before the bubble started. Seems unlikely. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:07:58
Highly debatable in any case it would not stop another bubble. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:56:58


Then you have very little understanding of the idea of censorship-resistant money. (2 week account. Should I be surprised?) Being able to send value to anyone anywhere at any time without fear of seizure or downtime is not something ordinary money can offer, never mind a lottery ticket.


If your aunt had balls...
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:54:26
Why use it for that when there are perfectly good alternatives? It’s not what Bitcoin is about.

@_date: 2018-11-28 20:24:34
Yes there is.
@_date: 2018-11-05 23:26:38
Yes it does. I'm storing value in Bitcoin I could be storing in a bank. And for free. And without fear of seizure.

How is it any more stupid than buying at 19k? Buy when others are fearful.

I didn't say that. Although I do believe long term it is a good store of value. If it rises even better.
I just used 80% as an example because it was symmetrical.
In 2017 Bitcoin rose 1900%. So much for 80%.
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:16:08


Does it? If there are 12 one offs one - and there probably have been, do they get the coverage the Thousand Oaks shooting will get? No way.


There are many new users. And several posts on this page say along the lines "oh, you can confiscate Bitcoin too".
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:31:03
Doesn’t that make it self fulfilling prophecy?
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:42:50
Or at least they could be a bit more patient.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:00:19
It is when it went up 1900% the previous year.

@_date: 2018-11-27 13:53:53
It’s a payment network also. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:36:25
Because it came down in a straight line. All easy with hindsight. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:05:18
They saw it rising and started putting their savings into then panic sold when it dropped leading this crash.

Yeah, it's all crystal ball stuff. Whatever you say. Don't pick on me anyway. It wasn't my prediction. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:06:33
Yep. Once you hear ordinary folk talking about it's time to sell.
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:17:50
Did merchant adoption drive the price to 20k? Of course not - get rich quick fools put in their live savings (then panic sold when it dropped in price - tarnishing Bitcoin's name on the way). So did Bitcoin drop because it had been debased or because it had been severely overbought? Several merchants adopted it in 2015. It didn't make any difference to the price.
The price has nothing to do with merchant indifference because this does not matter a jot to Bitcoin.  It's not where Bitcoin's strengths lie. It's more of a digital gold. You can already buy things satisfactorily with cash and cards, so what need for another method?
I said cherrypicking because long term it doesn't matter. You just have to look at an ATH chart to see where it is going.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:52:14
They share many of the same characteristics. 
10k to mine Bitcoin in some places so hardly far cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:25:05
Bcash dropped 10x at least. 
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:23:54




Ha, sure you're not. BCH has fewer txs per day than Dogecoin.


Because it's the only crypto that dragged itself up instead of riding others coattails.
You're a shill.

@_date: 2018-11-26 00:27:09


That is clearly not so. And I pointed out the reasons. Points you ignored.
Cuba was an example. Paypal can freeze your account at a whim, so not the best argument.
Collectibles are physical. Comics can be scanned but people will pay thousands for originals.
Bitcoin is neutral. It cannot be a scam or a fraud. It can be surrounded by scammers. Fiat is a scam. 
I didn't downvote you. Probably someone else. Not surprisingly. Probably because you couldn't be more wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:28:17
But it’s the chart that matters. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:02:06
Mass psychology.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:44:07
As a 2013-ner also, I concur.
Nothing so far we haven't seen before. Actually the bull run was unprecedentedly long so what affect that will have remains to be seen.
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:01:57
You're really comparing Bitcoin to the bolivar? Bitcoin hasn't lost value because extra coins were unscrupulously produced. It was vastly overbought at the end of last year.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:08:12
I linked to this earlier. :-P
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:06:17
I completely agree with everything you said so clearly you've misunderstood my post(s)/point(s).
By one-off shootings I meant single fatality.
Also think Bitcoin is much safer to transport than gold regardless if story is bull. There is a limit you can bring anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:50:11
I would think $500 is highly unlikely. It was that before the last bubble and just after the halving. More holders now and fewer coins issued. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:45:30
It is for the whales and early adopters. They’re gobbling up these “cheap” coins. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:59:36
At least he has a pair.
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:14:57
Because they did just that - put their life savings into it (supposedly). It wouldn’t be money they could sacrifice. And then probably panic sold when it went down to 18k or whatever. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:13:47
Don't confuse the markets with Bitcoin, troll.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:59:59
Which is why yours is the top comment. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:07:34
That would depend on the reasons for the drops. The issuance of Bitcoins did not suddenly change.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:51:58


You missed my point. Despite a crash in April of that year people still FOMOed 7-8 months later. 
And percentage wise the crashes are no different to now. Anyway you think something will rise 1900% in a year (2017) and there will be no pullback?
@_date: 2016-09-03 19:56:10

@_date: 2018-11-30 01:57:35
Just go here: 
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:46:33
Fiat wouldn’t gain 80% either. BTC lost that because it was overbought not through debasement. Long term it’s rising. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:39:48
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:59:23
What you call a bit less shit is, despite this year, one of the greatest investments in history. And as a money far superior to the bolivar. Bitcoin will recover because as I said the crash was the result of an overheated market, the bolivar has no chance.
And stop being a fucking pussy. Bitcoin is still far more stable than the Venezuelan currency. Don't confuse the markets with currency policy. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:44:10
Yes, they take your money bit by bit with annual fees. They can seize it if they want on behalf of some government or other body. They know all your transactions. They can stop a payment to an unauthorised person or country.  They waste money and energy protecting physical items could be purely digital. Stop defending this dinosaur.

Or use solar or something. POS completely unproven.
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:35:08
Maybe but It still dropped about 80%. And people weren’t wary after that?
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:02:07
If it fell from 1250 to 166 in 2015 it can recover from 3K, lower volume then or not.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:04:53
So far anyway.

I would say enlightened countries like Canada, Holland etc. are more likely to take up the baton. The US, China and others will become technological backwaters.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:36:20
You need to get over subservience to governments. Bitcoin is the first money that doesn’t need them. The governments merely decree their money has value. Bitcoin has to work at it.

No you cannot. There are a number of countries that are banned such as Cuba. And those that aren't can be subject to delays because of fears of money laundering. ATMS where I live are shut after 10pm and banks online can be shut for maintenance late at night.


It takes 10 minutes not a week. And the funds won't gain 20% either.


Bitcoin's value has been hard earned. The dollar has had its value bestowed on it. You think BTC is a collectible because you don't seem to understand this.
Fiat is debased, can be seized etc.
I think you're confusing Bitcoin, the world's first means of transferring value without a middle man, with Cryptokitties.

How is it intrinsically valuable? It’s only valuable because we humans have agreed it is. And there were no electronics in the past. So citing this is irrelevant. In any case gold is useless for stuff like building bridges or airplanes. 
And why the hell are you on here if so cynical?
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:29:53
That’s purely your opinion. 10k is not a small amount of money. 
Edit: reading your comment again it makes no sense. You say first says it's easy to earn 10k. Huh? 10k is the investment. Secondly you fail to notice the 10k is a gift so there's no risk.

There will always be buyers and at a certain price those comfortable with their holdings in Bitcoin will not sell too low.

You're assuming the Venezuelan customs are doing anything out of the ordinary. Are you telling me you can carry as much gold as you want across any border? Keep dreaming. Usually there's a 10k limit in local currency. And it has to be declared. Why would this be reported?


That's unprovable. Because unreported shootings will not be found.

Cash is physical. And not finite in supply or deflationary. 


The crash is the result of that incessant buying. So if it's cherry-picking so is your example.
The developers want to put decentralisation and security above everything else and good for them. A payment system (if you want that) needs a strong foundation.
The rise in 2016 I think was due to the last halving.
Many countries beside the US have credit cards and certainly cash.


I don't debate that.

Because it's down from a price that was caused by greedy people wanting to make a fast buck?
There's no such as it not being profitable to mine. If there are fewer miners it will be easier to mine.

You don't actually have the coins just the keys to them, so your wallet is more like a bank or a safe.

@_date: 2018-11-01 01:39:25
And as I mentioned earlier everyone who bought in the first nine years is still in profit. Short term buying is a risk but as I’ve also said, at least you’ll have something of value, both monetarily and in a utilitarian sense. Of course there will be some losers. But 99.99999% of lottery tickets are losers.

No chance it will go that low.

Was 1900% last year.
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:56:02


Copying code does not make something as good as Bitcoin. There's the network effect, number of nodes, security, infrastructure etc. Why use them when you can use Bitcoin? Sending $10 costs the same in each.
Just because there are scammers as you call them does not make bitcoin a scam. The vast majority of scams involve credit cards etc. No one is pushing you to buy Bitcoin in any case. But I guess it's only a scam if you don't make a profit huh?
By the way, before last December there were two full years of the price rising when people could have taken a profit so please spare the scam shit.
I don't why I'm arguing with a "Redditor for six days" anyway.

@_date: 2019-01-04 22:49:26
A Bitcoin is the standard unit though. People want a whole Bitcoin. A Satoshi is not the smallest theoretical unit anyway. They could move the decimal point with a fork to allow for more.

@_date: 2019-01-13 23:05:21


Where did you get those figures? And what's technically to stop that from happening? It went from .000-whatever-was-the-first-recorded-price to 20K and you doubt a million or several million dollar bitcoin?


Here come the insults. Define low? £3K+ would have been ridiculed a few years ago.


That was a conservative figure. Even from a cent (it started lower) to $3500 is 35 million percent increase. You must a fancy house.
Your rant about Bakkt and Lightning is purely your subjective take. Even without these things Bitcoin is the world's first and best protocol for storing and transferring value without a middleman. If weren't clueless you would see that.

@_date: 2019-01-13 18:25:35


What, are you the moderator of this debate?


And how do you know this cannot happen? Even in its infancy it's already far sounder money than any fiat currency. Where's your evidence banks are not interested?
Bakkt is coming. It's not like the ETF which needs approval. And whether it's a flop or not is pure speculation on your part.


A ten year chart says otherwise. Obviously it's not easy or everyone would make money off it.


Says who?


Don't confuse Bitcoin's "central bank" with ease of buying Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin is successful in the long run the average guy will be practically forced to use it just as he's forced to use fiat currencies. Forced out of necessity hopefully though not because it's legal tender.


It was $200 before the last bull run.
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:40:51
Bitcoin is a money that has not be forced on people and given a decreed value (like fiat) and yet people chose to use it - because they appreciate the censorship-resistance and the freedom from governmental control. Yeah, that is revolutionary.

Bitcoin has value too. It’s scarce and useful. Gold is in no way suited for the internet age, it can be seized, you’re too reliant on third parties, it’s not easily verifiable, it’s not programmeable and its price is heavily manipulated so it doesn’t rise as it should. 
Bitcoin is still up millions of percent in its nine year history. Sure there are crashes, but nothing in history has the same returns.

And that's not an argument. I didn't say it would become a reserve currency. However a money that was once only good for buying alpaca socks and drugs on silk road is now being taken far more seriously by the likes of Forbes and Bloomberg.
Your fiat currency is a worthless inflationary crap which people only use because they are forced to.


There's no reason it shouldn't go through. Government shutdown not helping. Bitcoin never shuts down by the way.


Short term, yes. Of course fewer are buying it. They are people like yourself who don't really understand it and see it purely as an investment.


Fundamentals are fine. Don't confuse market emotions with Bitcoin. Lightning's success show that the markets don't know shit.

It's perfectly ready. Even 5 years ago you could secure your money in your own "bank", send to anyone, anywhere at anytime.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:48:02
It has no utility? Really? Be able to send value anywhere to anyone at anytime without fear of seizure is utility.
I like the Action Comic reference though. So you understand rarity and desirability is important.

Why not? They will have a financial incentive to continue.
Why should they accept your gold in an apocalypse? As I said, too hard to guard and transport. If considering its physical aspects, it cannot be eaten, it's too soft to be used to make weapons.

I dunno. I think holding on the way down is harder. Even if you bought at $10 you're going to keep asking why didn't you sell at recent ATHs and buy back in.

Define global scale. It could take just a few billionaires or central banks.
Percentage wise there's nothing tiny about it. And if you indeed think it's tiny why shouldn't be plenty of room for growth? You also forget that Bitcoin has had to earn its value it hasn't been decreed to have value by a government. No one has been forced to use it.


And that's not a bubble of course? Anyway that was 50 years. I actually bought ten bitcoins in 2013 for £600. And that was during a bubble. Lousy investment that was huh?


Not everyone trusts banks. They know with Bitcoin their funds cannot be seized. It isn't just speculation.


1 to 100= 100% 1 to 3500= 3500% Are you a retard?
From 1 CENT (.01) to 3500.00 is 35 million per cent. Are you a stupid cunt? And it started below a cent.

The miners have to make a profit. They will try at least to break even when selling new coins. In this way the coins are given a "backing". And a currency should not be too easy to create.

I don’t like the term because it gives a validity to the altcoin  (which is what it is) that was produced. Bitcoin had to start from 0 and did it in the fairest way possible. No one knew it would take off. Bcash launches and is instantly on prominent exchanges and valued at $300 or whatever it was. All thanks to some perceiving it as another Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 02:39:52
But a central bank is producing more copies of a currency that already has a market price. It doesn't have to start from scratch.
Bitcoin *has* had to earn its value. Bank notes only had some value to begin with because they were supposedly backed by gold. By the time the gold standard was dropped the currency had been "bootstrapped" as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:06:37
Merchant acceptance is not a criteria for whether a currency is valid or not. The school lunch place (presumably in the US) also won't accept Euros, the Yen, Sterling, gold etc.

@_date: 2019-01-06 16:08:57
You're confusing market emotions with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:39:38
You expected it to go up in a straight line? :-P
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:25:23
Both really.
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:57:07
Reeks of manipulation. No reason Bitcoin should be dropping so much.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:32:09
Fool's gold. They don't have the traction etc.
@_date: 2019-01-18 01:26:19
Then maybe that's why he hurried to get the .org url.

A deleted scene from Annihilation. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 15:09:37
Immutability. So that guarantees consensus won't change.


This was asking about those gold properties you mentioned.
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:56:21
Don't worry. You're blocked, asshole.
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:09:35
I don't think a version with crayons counts.
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:02:04
Some analysts say yes. But then below 3K. Let's see.
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:21:26
Touchy, aren't you?
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:34:41
Let's see. Memories are short. There were even two bubbles in 2013. Don't underestimate FOMO. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:40:24
I wasn't saying which is best. Just thought it would have been better as an example than using Apple.
Bitcoin's bear market started long before the present stock market woes. Anyway, Bitcoin and others are doing OK at the moment.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:19:30
Partially because the supply is indeed limited - and, importantly, immutably so.
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:25:50
Money, finance? Semantics. 
The first time in history we have a money/payment system that's out of the hands of a middleman. The first time digital scarcity has been realized.
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:47:54
A fork is not Bitcoin. And no one will want to increase the supply. No one would benefit. 
Name gold’s unique properties. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:05:50
Explain why not.
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:24:38
What was professional about this?
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:17:12
And yet if someone on here makes a post saying banks are under threat from Bitcoin he gets downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:59:52
Look at the comments. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:02:57
Who cares about adoption? No average guy uses gold as an investment.
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:56:51
The amount is clearly rising despite the crash. It had 965k one month ago according to archive.org.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:42:06
Because it's better if the value is earned than bestowed.
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:14:23
Any shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:15:42
I don’t percentage decrease is a reliable indicator. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:37:44
Yes they are. Because to change the block size you to hard fork to change the protocol. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 15:05:30
He's been seen since then tbf.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:42:10
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:20:16
Anyway, yeah, it was funny. They thought it was an exodus from BTC to BCH. It was a trap.
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:39:38
Why do you say that?
Never mind, I just saw your name. :-P
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:10:59
You didn't understand his tweet did you?
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:11:40
Huh? You think all those hard forks help Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:27:28
It could but going to 10000 again doesn't look as unlikely as it did a few days ago.
There were plenty of dips on the way up.
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:37:56
It's already happening. Coin mixing has been around for years, then there's MimbleWimble and the like.
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:44:36
And get rekt. Why are you getting so upset over it? Are you one of his sockpuppet accounts?
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:23:41


That doesn't matter. And how would people know for sure they are the same?
I said a better analogy. It's a very very tenuous one.
@_date: 2016-09-04 02:10:39
I'm over 40. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:40:12
So Satoshi screwed up, then, making it finite and deflationary. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:29:40
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:47:24
I was going by the earliest price I could find. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:01:21
Because if it is happening regularly it will not be the news all the time. How many one-off shootings are in the news? Or low fatality road accidents?
Anyway, even if the story above is not true it has happened - even in the US. Remember Executive Order 6102.
Bitcoin is far harder to seize. Impossible if secured properly.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:36:25
But it doesn't start from zero as bitcoin had to.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:31:02
Someone else said $500 elsewhere on this page.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:08:27
True, but nowadays it can only go down so far or no one will be able to mine it. Plus some will never sell.
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:13:52
You would have to imagine if Bitcoin is still around it would be partly because it's valued for its stability (not the price). So, probably.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:29:50
Spare the imbecilic beanie baby comparisons. I heard all this shit 3 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:41:31

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:08:33


They had no affect. It couldn't be carried through.
Fees didn't stop Bitcoin from rising to 19K. And that was before lightning. People will pay large fees anyway for a truly censorship resistant and borderless money if they think it's worth it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:56:27
You delusional if you think there's no chance of it happening.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:51:35
You must be fun at parties.
Where are your sources for these percentages?
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:13:18
Not (yet) the dominant payment system.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:07:22
Gold is valuable only because we agree it is. It's not intrinsic.
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:43:22
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:14:13
He knew there only be 21 million.
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:42:26
How hard can it be to hide a few words?
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:07:44
No, that would suggest they can just change it again in the future.
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:23:03
It was China. Warren Buffet has rubbished Bitcoin to little affect. One man’s words would never have cause this. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 13:56:18
He didn’t argue for them to stop. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:58:59
Artificially stable.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:00:21
Huh? The dollars? Who cares about that?
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:51:38
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:57:43
Doubt it. Not so soon anyway. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:43:33
Yeah. I made just made this point. People on here apparently think you can take as much gold as you want across borders. The people in the tweet may have brought too much or didn't declare it.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:51:59
You need electricity to mine it, transport it, guard it, trade it, assay it etc.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:20:37
Percentage-wise 1 cent to 3500 is a lot more than 3500 to 1 million.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:17:34
No, I meant to store your money safe from malignant governments etc.
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:33:21




Desirable is not getting rich quick. That's just the markets going crazy. Anyway, long term the trend is upward.


It was always the case. Perhaps more people should hold instead of letting it all fall into the hands of the well off.


And a comeback is not guaranteed.
If it weren't deflationary that might be the case.
Crypto is the future and Bitcoin looks likely to reign for the foreseeable future.
If there's no supply the price would go up surely? You can't compare it with your coin which has no history and has not broken any ground.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:27:40
Someone argued the minimum amount of capital tied up in transactions at any given time — is just $3 billion. I knew it was 3 something.
@_date: 2019-01-16 01:29:50
Like you'll hold through all that.
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:40:56
A digital gold, a money if you prefer.


Excuse me? It's the opposite surely? Governments love inflationary currencies because (amongst other things) they encourage spending.


That's called saving.
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:34:02
It’s not showing the bars percentage wise. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:08:45


Millions? We were talking thousands. [Anyway, yes, they do.]( Admittedly this was his very first appearance, not his own title.


@_date: 2018-03-27 22:44:03
Who said anything about currencies?
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:57:50
Overdue if true. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:19:13
Banks are already phasing out low and high denominations. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:07:51
I wouldn't consider them forks. Clones yeah.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:29:43
It is. You can now send one Satoshi for nothing. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:22:37


Because it's a red herring. Stop justifying the government's actions. 


You missed that bit? Not that it matters. They seized the gold - that's all that matters.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:46:02
Thought it was obvious from the point he was making.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:45:47
I read once giving too many options puts customers off.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:19:05
The currency itself is the incentive to keep it running securely.
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:40:44
The opposite of the opposite sex.
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:16:26
It's incumbent on you to prove your point.
See you at your next throwaway account.
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:45:41
That sounds like you're being digital just for the sake of being digital.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:35:33
Not sure why you’re downvoted. Will live free?
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:05:52
Then you missed his point. Anyway, it already innovated. Digital scarcity, decentralized money, etc. Every other coin is basically just copying this.
edit: the tweet doesn't preclude innovating anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:47:06
ITT: price falling equates to a weakness in Bitcoin.

We're not seeing enough hodling at the moment. People suggest hodling anyway over risky trading.
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:53:14
It is very much a big deal. Bitcoin could go to $500 and still function. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:12:53
Because it's trying to do too much, and theDAO showed code is not law.
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:33:14
If true then you should know better.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:56:13
Because it’s decentralised. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:34:51
Who says it has to be a currency?
The Silk Road founder genius use  the username "altoid" on SR and another forum. So he was not so sophisticated.
The Silk Road was a huge (illegal) target anyway. Why would they devote their resources chasing me?
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:46:12
Many predicted very high valuations for Bitcoin years ago.
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:05:30
It wouldn’t be an innovation. It wouldn’t be earning its dues. It wouldn’t be starting from 0 conceptually or in value. And it would be centralized as it would self consciously copying Bitcoin. Furthermore it could never hope to gain the network effect, infrastructure, hashing power,  security, decentralization, recognition etc etc. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:55:30
Even better then. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:07:05
Can't predict but you can say what is more likely.
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:41:32
It runs on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:20:37
Then why are you here fool?
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:12:37


If you want to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:07:23
Only the "government" of Bitcoin knows no debt.
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:03:20

Do a version as the monolith on the moon. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:10:12

@_date: 2019-01-20 17:14:44
And how likely is that?

Perhaps not yet at fungibility. But getting there.

No one cares about your soap. Or even know you or it exists. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:20:28
Holding is using too you know. You are saving your money without relying on a third party. Miners surely make enough from mining at the moment.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:51:54
Why? He's right in this case. Bitcoin doesn't owe you anything.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:09:59
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:21:19
So it's like a premine. That's centralized.
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:44:09
ETH used to seem so strong but yes it's not looking good. Glad I sold all mine months ago. Not at ATH but did OK.

@_date: 2018-03-30 18:28:47
But the returns can be spectacular. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:55:11
If you're allowed to keep gold.
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:45:24
Because Bitcoin cannot be forged and is easy to verify. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:59:19
What’s proof of stake to do with it? And why switch to an unproven system that makes coin creation less secure?
I remember people complaining about fees in 2017 despite 10-20x. Never happy.

I don't buy that. But I was wondering about your own situation.
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:13:23
And to kill off any supposed rivals. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:57:39
That’s not through debasement though is it? Also up several million per cent vs these currencies in its ten years. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:58:15
Then you haven't lost money till you sell also.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:53:33
Like the one on the moon (supposedly).
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:54:06
These are not monetary features though.
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:08:37
Long term.
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:10:36
It was worth far less though.
What if there had been no manpower or horsepower to do those things? These are also silly arguments
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:08:13
And without a money pertaining to it's useless.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:15:41
Now if they just had some products in stock.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:36:49
As opposed to trolling cunts like you two?
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:47:57
What’s that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:23:12
What a drama queen. Yes, that's exactly how it works. I bought in 2013 so I'm not getting out.
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:05:29
That was from $300.
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:09:10
I know that. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:30:25
Good man. Sold mine too. But not quite that high. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:48:29
You're talking rubbish, man. Kidnappings? Bloody hell.
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:37:42
Because once it’s been shown to work the first time anything else that copies it is going to be self consciously imitating it and centralized. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:30:06
Out and out scam. As is the coin itself. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:14:54
In other words overbought.
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:49:39
There were two bubbles in 2013.

Did you read the article?
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:15:48


It's encumbent on you. I heard nothing about this event in 2018.


And you are exaggerating.


That sounds like something an altcoiner would say. They have even less of a chance.


Why would Lightning need POW? POW is for securing the Bitcoin network and creating new coins.
POS is liable to be hijacked by large holders of coins.
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:24:37


You mean spending? Not necessarily. Any profits can go to towards buying things you really want.


Not sure I follow.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:01:17
That's a middleman service. Bitcoin couldn't have this?
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:32:52

Just drawing an analogy with your headline.
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:49:11
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:05:57
I think you're reading too much into the original post. The point was to be skeptical of those who dismiss promising technology.
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:24:59
He’s not allowed to change his mind? Obviously many value immutability over txs. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:47:53
I'm not an Ethereum fan but apart from ETC's supposed immutability ETH is better.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:48:35
The important thing is that the price is higher than the last bear market. So the long term is upward.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:01:42
Really? All I hear on here is spend your bitcoin and holders are fools. Despite the fact that spending doesn't add value and holders prop up Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:56:08
You've held it that long and still don't get it?
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:25:07
Screw them. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:33:10
Maybe you’re right because most of the comments are snarky. They perhaps prefer a story of someone who accepts Bitcoin at his hotdog stand. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:31:10
I see you're under the impression Bitcoin is a mere currency only. You do know it's also the protocol for issuing the coins? And therefore in that sense analogous to the Federal Reserve and in a sense to a government.
@_date: 2019-01-16 04:05:01




Where were your answers last post? Just a sophomoric comment. I'm middle-aged btw.


I don't care what the reasons were. A government should not have the power to seize gold like that. That wouldn't happen now of course because there would be outrage - in the US at least. But things can change.




Oh, aren't you smart. If I supposedly lack knowledge then you should patiently explain and argue. Not act high and mighty. I've been on this sub 6 years fyi.

No, it's not. You just chose to send using Segwit in your wallet.


It's the world's first and best money that needs no third party to store or send value. And has been for 10 years. How is it not working? Because Walmart doesn't accept it? They don't accept gold or the Euro either.

It's predominantly in the hands of governments' central banks.
It's no more a pyramid scheme than gold. Bitcoin was started very fairly. From 0. No one knew it would take off unlike the alt creators who are confident their coins will garner some interest and gain some or even considerable valuations.
Institutions and banks can buy Bitcoin. It doesn't need the average guy to help it. The average guy doesn't know what he wants. Would he have wanted a phone with no physical buttons ten or so years ago?
@_date: 2019-01-02 03:12:20

So copy the code and launch Bitcoin 2.0. If you even can. I'll bet you won't get more than a few cents for it. There has to be a consensus otherwise forget it.

Don't be disingenuous. You know what I meant by people. The average man. The governments own that gold and let the average chump use the unsound paper money that they issue.


They would be unwise not too were it becomes a reserve currency. I didn't say it was happening yet necessarily. But they have been Bitcoin hedge funds and the like for years. Bakkt is coming etc. Hopefully an ETF.
Joe only wants to buy when the price is sky-rocketing. Not in bear markets or even periods of consolidation. That's why they are Joe Averages.
The average man wants his hands held. He want the government looking after money, his money. He doesn't know any better.
Bitcoin without decentralization (and immutability) is worthless. These are the things that matter. Not tx s per second and so on. These can be added to the form foundation later. Already are in fact with lightning.

The other part is don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:01:00
Being in control of your own money and being to send to someone else without a middle man is indisputably useful. If you think that's an opinion so be it.

Actual use of a currency is the most meaningless metric of all. Fiat currencies for example are forced on people.

Who says I'm defending that type?
Anyway, his Bitcoin would still be worth something and have some chance of rebounding. The S2X futures are now virtually worthless.

I honestly believe holding is the foundation of the Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin is not legal tender. Why should anyone want to accept it as payment - unless it’s desirable? You want to own it.

@_date: 2018-11-24 23:10:58
The fault is not in Bitcoin itself. The markets are too small and illiquid. Too many bit players. People shouldn't be selling because they are worried about savings. Hopefully Bakkt and an ETF will will bring in big players.

Of course there's risk. But nothing has ever given the returns. Perhaps because I bought in early 2013 I'm sanguine now. I believed in it even it crashed from $260 to $60.

That's not what the article said at all. There's nothing wrong with manning up though and fighting a clear scam.
@_date: 2019-01-04 05:33:42
Sounds like bullshit. Just because of the tenuous connection with Bitcoin it’s worth up to 100,000? Much more than a Bitcoin itself? Pristine copies of Amazing Spiderman No. 1 don’t go for that. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:27:31
Well that does not reflect well on the alts either. 
Anyway, Bitcoin is tanking because of supposed clamp downs in S Korea and India. And probably because the bubble has run its course.
Bitcoin shot to $19000 before lightning came out. Lightning is now released so

You’re assuming it has to challenge other currencies directly. There are offshore accounts for example. 32 trillion dollars in total. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:33:04
It crashed to 60 anyway not 75.

Legalese bullshit. What else are you going to base future performance on? Although it's not the only thing. The fact that Bitcoin has a limited, deflationary supply is a big consideration.

No, because you're still storing value without a third party. And something like debit cards are just a workaround for now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:53:50
9 years isn't long enough? And, as I write, anyone who bought at any time in its history before November or October is still in profit.
Store of value alone not enough, but censorship resistant and borderless and programmable, etc. help.
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:38:19
It wasn't a bullshit prediction though was it? He took many factors into account such as Bitcoin's immutable supply limit.
@_date: 2019-01-17 03:20:44
Might break?
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:23:19
All offshore and Swiss bank accounts have bags reputations in that case.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:48:36
I don’t remember anyone being called a weak hand for selling at 15k. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:09:36
So even then very high valuations were proposed. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:36:14
It's not decentralised. Bitcoin itself has never been hacked.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:10:03
Except those who sold high and want to buy back in.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:05:33


Yes. You can acquire it in a way that does not connect it to you, you can use mixing services etc.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:58:12
And still up 700% in a year.
Of course it all depends on when you bought.
And you know I'm just reciprocating your downvotes. So why bother?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:06:47
No excuse. The s is pronounced like a z.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:51:31
What pretentious drivel.
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:20:13
Those down a lot are more vocal. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:05:47
Long term it is a great store of value. Volatility is not inherent in Bitcoin. The market is small and full of noobs.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:24:58
So why not stuff your paper wallet there?
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:33:52
You pretend to be intelligent and yet you act like a petulant cunt.
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:13:43
Because that's the name Satoshi gave it.
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:03:07
And how would the price start at 20k?
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:13:48
Presumably he means the ETF.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:48:35
What's an international bank account?
Can't you use Bitstamp or Bitfinex or something?
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:17:33
That's not what I said either. I'm saying that we now have a fantastic way to store and send value without a third party but most people are too ignorant to see it.
Bitcoin is the fax machine in your analogy? Closer to email. Twenty five years ago most people were sending written correspondence or phoning not sending emails however, now it's done entirely with email, messaging services and voip.
@_date: 2019-01-24 00:16:31
This is bullshit!1!
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:19:54
Yes, his risk is now zero really.
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:54:36
Some people said there was a chance. This is not an argument anyway. 500 would make it lower than or as low as it was before the last halving and the bubble. There’s no chance. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:17:42
Very easy in hindsight to say when the top was. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:13:14
It might be still a good price to sell now. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:41:49
Just testbeds for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:02:25
Surely then the alts should be rising in price as people sell their btc for alts.


It is updated you know and still the most censorship resistant coin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:37:53


And they will do that how?
People are already using it to store their money instead of in bank accounts.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:41:55
Disingenuous comparison. People have no control over the heavenly bodies (or vice vera). They do however have an affect on what is bought and sold. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:42:12
A bit of both.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:15:00
1. You implied it by casting aspersions on people showing that the USD is a truly shit store of value, which it is.
2. It's precisely because it usually is compared to USD. What are you on about? And what's wrong with the cunts on here? Can't argue without name-calling. Fine I'll do it too.
3. 80 million per cent was a conservative figure. 1 cent to $8000 is about 80m%. Of course it started at less than one cent.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:16:28
The miners couldn't get 2X to go through. I don't think they have as much say as people think.
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:55:14
What's this from? Reminds me of the old Jim Carrey skit.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:53:57
Having weak hands suggests they sold at a loss and probably won’t buy back in. There are many still in profit and will hold till the next bull run. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:31:18
You mean that they couldn't get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:58:57
Scam my arse. There were two full years to take profits. If you fucked up so badly that's your problem.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:14:40
Funny how pessimistic predictions are accepted without proof on here judging by the upvotes.
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:07:27
All these are human errors and interventions.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:16:24
Yeah and you knew perfectly well what I had meant too.
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:11:23
I meant single fatality shootings don't get anywhere near the same publicity even though collectively they can numerically exceed the massacres on the same day.
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:57:01
Of course, being rare also helps which is why I chose those examples. 
I said "not selling" I didn't say "owning". When some will never sell (at least not for another 5-10 years) it helps to reduce the number of sellers slowing down the drop in price.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:45:22


If if. And if it goes to million dollars you'll be rich. If gold or the collapses you're in the shit also. This is not an argument.
Try sending your friend in Venezuela gold in ten minutes and make it easy to verify that is not counterfeit. Gold belongs in the Stone Age.
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:39:00
Holding does not necessarily mean just speculating. Many like Bitcoin for its censorship resistance and its independence from traditional markets and central banks.
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:38:27
It has transparency. But not really other layers.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:38:49
An upside down text converter website. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:08:22
But if holding is so desirable why aren't there more vendors accepting it (assuming they use Segwit and lightning)?
I agree that it isn't a great currency at the moment. Better as an asset.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:19:08
I presume you've taken some profits and not just held for 8 years?
edit: missing word
@_date: 2018-11-09 03:17:56
Not 100% fungible, you mean.
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:16:23
Over losing $200?
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:47:15
One satoshi was being compared with it. Don't get your knickers in a twist. And the bolivar wasn't always this weak. Fiat currencies depreciate over time. As will the US dollar. Only things like gold and Bitcoin will maintain or increase in value.
Bitcoin is already better than gold anyway so it doesn't need this comparison in any case.
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:57:47


Foolish investing was not mass adoption.


The average value was 150K. Which makes a difference.
Storing is using Bitcoin too. You know. Why does it always have to transferred to be used?
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:53:26
Just an image in Photoshop would do it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:54:22
Looks like trolling to me. Why is on here in the first place? Not just this sub but any crypto sub.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:08:04
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:36:40
Which is why they carried through with S2X. Oh...
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:59:23
Because it will bury the shitcoins also. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:56:18
Then stop reposting. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:33:31
Bitcoin has owned the dollar last ten years. Why not again?
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:54:30
The markets happened. Bitcoin stronger than ever.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:33:25
Do people honestly think JP Morgan had any affect on the price? It was all China. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:32:36
You were probably one of the ones who said it was going to 3000 a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:26:44
Don't blame Bitcoin for incompetent exchanges.
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:30:15
Seriously? It looked like he was bending over backwards to show Bitcoin prices at their most sedate. And 2015 suggests that the price could go lower this year.


Perhaps he was being hyperbolic in this case?
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:47:32
That would suggest we go $106,000 next?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:40:48
Straw man. Where did I say they were?
I thought it was obvious - that they too have replaced or are replacing ages old systems - Written correspondence, bricks and mortar shopping, landline phones and payphones.
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:06:54
Well enough.
@_date: 2018-11-04 02:50:35
Unless you're the president.
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:51:53
Some us are looking more long term. It could go to 2k and still go 20x in the future.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:51:55
No he doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:26:13
Says the guy who naively thinks Bitcoin is just a currency.
@_date: 2019-01-21 04:55:31
Well surely it was better it was resolved before it was revealed. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:36:58
Did you miss the point of the above Tweet. Copying the code doesn't work.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:17:41
So many salty comments. Too many still too obsessed with the price.
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:25:03
That's 30 years earlier than he mentioned.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:41:13
Calling Bitcoin, and only Bitcoin, a pyramid scheme on a Bitcoin sub is trolling. You're the one with problems.
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:20:21
They don't even have to go through security. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:42:07
Figure pulled from ass.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:08:18
Bitcoin is still up 700% v. the dollar from just a year ago, so his is the moronic comment.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:50:51


He was making an argument. We could say you are bullshit FUD dumping.
Define adoption. Simply owning is adoption in my book.
Bitcoin has nothing to fear from the alts. Each one has tried to flippen it and failed miserably.
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:39:49
It's also a store of value and a payment mechanism. And it's programmeable.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:03:42
He doesn't mean the price.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:06:36
Smiling at your predictions if that's what they are.
@_date: 2018-11-08 15:52:50
It’s far more difficult. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:23:47
And they warned many times it was a bubble and not to invest more than they could afford to lose. It was pinned to the top of the front page.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:12:09
OP was warned.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:57:57
Isn’t this one?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:18:39
Stunningly close so far.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:07:39


I didn't say there would be demand for Bitcoin because people would not sell. I said it would stop it from going to zero or would keep the price at a certain level. Stop straw manning.


The product has to be useful. Your toenails is a silly example.


It might have some - due to speculation. But it will never prevail over Bitcoin because of the network effect and not being able to do anything of use that Bitcoin can't do. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:20:14
This message is a year too late perhaps.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:03:44
Not if you bought high and sold low. Anyway bag-holding implies Bitcoin won't recover. If it can recover from falling to $166 in January 2015, $1500-$3500 or wherever it bottoms out should present no obstacles.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:44:15
You can't have a blockchain without a coin behind. Bitcoin is currently the most venerable one.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:20:21
Why wait?
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:17:32
You can do that now. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:01:51
At 19k it was clearly vastly oversold. No one was believing these prices. Even at 10k. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:58:42
Another paradox: Why would anyone want to accept your Bitcoin if even you don't want it?
If holding is desirable is that a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:05:13
That would still make it a 80 million per cent increase, smartass.
And if you had the balls to hold, which from your attitude I doubt, you could have sold at 19,000. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:13:21
If it's primarily a store of value any figure is fair.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:49:33


Which is why BCH and BTC are worth the same. Oh...
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:32:41
It's not an illusion.
@_date: 2016-09-08 08:02:01
iMessage also sends sms. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:01:58
Legalese bullshit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:59:46
Some people. Assuming they are still holding. And now intend to sell. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:27:33
Week old account I see. Maybe you just want my coins. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:58:23
Because of Amazon? Have you stats showing more parcels are being delivered nowadays? Anyway if so Amazon has killed other mainstays like certain bookshops and record stores. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:01:41
It already does work even if it were 1 cent.
@_date: 2019-01-17 03:23:18


Whatever that means.
Long term the trend is upwards. Bubble or crashes notwithstanding.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:13:00
If you hold for 3-4 years I think you have a good chance of making a profit at least at some point.
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:34:37
You're just as bad: The price is falling therefore it will continue.


Sure. Like anyone else is following this.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:34:47


That didn't last 9 years.


That a silly comment. A money has to be easy to verify as real and cannot be too rare.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:41:48
It has the most hash power, it hasn't been hacked in 9 years etc.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:27:48


@_date: 2018-02-05 16:27:15
If there are a thousand other coins it's inevitable. But most of them rising in valuable is from late comers to crypto wanting to make money.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:18:02
Lighten up ffs. It's a cartoon.
And I listened to people like you after it crashed in 2013.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:46:57
$50? It didn’t even go to that after the first 2013 bubble. Steady on. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:48:20
It went up way too fast. It was wildly overbought, mostly by South Koreans looking to get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:47:02
In glory though no?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:36:54
But Bitcoin rose to 7000 while eth was stalled at 300.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:24:48
Enough buyers to keep it around $200.
The majority haven't a clue.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:03:19
That wouldn't help the price.
@_date: 2018-11-02 15:43:18
7% hashrate!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:05:39
Yeah, like it was somebody else.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:12:22
Tis but a scratch.
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:35:07
No reason to see why not. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:56:58
Real money is paper that can be printed at a whim?
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:12:15
So only you know where the bottom will be. Anyway IF it were to go to 999, why not wait till 800 or 500 etc? Not that I think it'll go that low.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:25:20


What else should you base it on?
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:46:32
Only if you seriously believe there will not be other bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:28:03
Ignorance of the fundamentals more like. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 17:08:40
It cannot be DDOSed. What are you talking about?  And the 51% attack is theoretical. And even if achieved the attacker would spend more than he would earn. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 18:35:23
I knew you'd say crypto. All riding on the back of Bitcoin. And none has risen as high as Bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:41:05


That does not mean they are right. Only one side can be.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:52:31
Three years then. Next halving.
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:24:02
Why do people keep upvoting this old joke?
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:04:50
Was it? You have a source for this?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:15:31
They can come knocking but if the coins are on a Ledger in another part of the country or another country there isn't much they can do. You can use mixing services to hide txs anyway.
In any case this is not a good argument. You are basically saying it is not perfect. Give me a better solution?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:37:15
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:42:01
Cannon fodder. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:00:01


And too many noobs buying.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:25:18


In a bad way I presume you mean.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:44:58
It's not a great currency anyway. Nor are any of the cryptos. Too volatile. Better as a long term store of value.
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:18:38
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:01:43
How is it Bitcoin's fault? Use multisig anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:05:29
I meant long time holders. Not around for two weeks like you. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:41:44
You’re comparing the laws of a country with the laws of physics? One of them can be changed. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:55:30
Btrash in some quarters.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:03:57
At 15,000 or so was the time to sell. Perhaps too late now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:03:11
It has a record of being stolen outside of exchanges though.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:25:44
The first sentence is not an argument anyway. He should jettison the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:59:05
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:20:26
It is if you have a lot of Bitcoins. And anyway it is a short term bullish sign. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:08:37
That’s going to be worth fuck all. Someone else could carry millions on a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:59:12
Not done. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:13:17
He said stability makes it valuable. He didn’t say a stable price makes it valuable. That wouldn’t make sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:33:09
Many big names missing.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:50:11
Great for a gold substitute though.
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:21:42
The markets decide, not the miners.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:32:14
He can also do more harm for Bitcoin than we ever will.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:15:14
You’re the one giving trading advice. If you don’t want to risk trading it’s safer to hold. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:24:06
I knew the top comment would be from some fiatsplainer.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:10:30
No, the same as $29000 to $3000.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:17:43
A lottery ticket has zero chance of recovering however. Bitcoin has crashed numerous times and then gone onto new highs.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:05:30
Kind of suspicious in light of what OP said. I don't think there's a conspiracy but there's definitely newcomers causing mischief.
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:57:39
Always called only "Andreas" because no one can be bothered to check how to spell his surname.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:07:47
Aren't you being just as dogmatic?
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:33:54
So's forex in that case.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:52:48
How do we know you're not a Chinese whale who wants our coins?
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:19:15
Namecoin etc.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:56:28
A large enough market cap would nullify volatility, Bitcoin then merely needs a way of making payments and txs more intuitive, faster and cheaper. A combination of lightning, and clever UIs and gadgets could fix that.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:42:48
And subsequently went to $19000. That "staganation" time was the opportunity to buy. Not December 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:42:37
You just read the headings apparently. He said for instance that Bitcoin was the MOST secure network.
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:35:05
So why did the price drop?
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:30:42

Cash is useless on the internet though. And it loses value over long periods. Bitcoin despite volatility is on an upward trend.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:15:47
Cheaper coins?

In relation to people trying to pass it off as Bitcoin, yes. Do I have to repeat myself?

16.6 million (currently) are not many at all compared to how many dollar bills are in circulation. 
70 billion coins and notes of $1 or more according [this source.]( 11.5 billion are 100 dollar bills.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:40:37


And why would anyone accept that? They can't even agree on block size. Now who's being naive. The point is the supply of the dollar is easily changed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:08:14

It's that price because people are using it as a store of value. Tulips and beanie babies are not rare, fungible, counterfeit-proof, censorship resistant or transferable over the web. Don't be disingenuous.

@_date: 2018-02-05 15:46:49
You don't get it do you?
No one said it is ready for mainstream.
It's new and contrary to the old system because there is no central party, it censorship resistant. It is outside the banks and government.
How your comment, with the usual piffle about fees, is at the top shows that this sub is going to the dogs. They've forgotten what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:16:51
And that would still not be Bitcoin's fault. You need to buy and trade the Bitcoin somewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:28:39
One man unrelated to Bitcoin or any government caused such a dip? I think not. It was all China.

@_date: 2018-03-31 15:04:54
Your first sentence just list vague characteristics. 
Bitcoin can send any amount anywhere at anytime without fear of seizure. If you see no value in that you never had a bank account. I sent 7k euros to a friend in Brazil. It took them two weeks to clear it.

It dipped many times last year.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:20:10


I didn't say that.
Hoarding leads to a lack of demand? How do you figure that out? Is that why gold and copies of Action Comics No. 1 are cheap?


If you believe in that crud what are you doing here?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:38:54

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:14:29


No more than any other story.


That wasn't my point. Fees didn't stop the rise. In fact the rise caused higher fees.

Then it's no better than anything else.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:30:09
An unnecessary one.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:51:41
When the other side plays dirty...
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:46:21
It would only give further lustre to Bitcoin if they adopt some form of crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:19:34
Not if you're Japanese.
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:10:33
You’re assuming the buyer or buyers would then sell them. 
There would be a big damage demand for Satoshi’s coins simply because they were Satoshi’s. 
I don’t think they’ll ever be moved now either.  
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:24:28
Then you don't understand what third party means. They were selling it themselves. It doesn't make Bitcoin dependent on third parties anyway. You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of the protocol.
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:46:09
Well, I was downvoted. I assumed it was you.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:21:28

Well they are the ones who foolishly pushed it to near 20k, a price it shouldn’t have gone anywhere near at this period in Bitcoin’s history. 
There were plenty of warnings on here and elsewhere not to invest more than you can lose. 
If you hold long term you shouldn’t be worried anyway.

I like Woz but he hadn't contributed for years.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:57:29
I didn't say you weren't into Bitcoin a while; why worry about a 3 week old account getting banned?
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:11:59
You didn't mention gold being indestructible so far. You said it was impossible to hack. If a trezor etc is incased in any case in a indestructible case how is it any less safe?


Theoretically. I could theoretically hack into the computerized network securing the gold's vault or theoretically have the ownership of gold transferred to me.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:12:27
OK. Have a upvote. ;-)
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:44:58

A store of value should remain the same at least. If it's going up even better. Volatility in Bitcoin has actually decreased over the years. It is not inherent to Bitcoin, its small market cap leaves it vulnerable to big shifts in value.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:14:27
Hmm. Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not. Of course it can and will crash but long term the trend is upward.

In its 9 years Bitcoin has fared spectacularly well against every fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:43:26


Because it has other uses, which I have stated. Use as a currency, if it comes, will be the last stage. Everyone has to have it first - there's no legal requirement to use it so people need something to coax them to have some. Expectation that Bitcoin rising in value is that incentive. Or one of them.

 The dollar and others are no longer backed by gold.
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:20:13
Many reasons. 
A major one being the unfortunate perception by some that Bitcoin is duplicatable (so-called "forks") or is easily replaceable by an alt with more txs per second or other features not dependent on security or network effects.

These bubbles are caused by greedy people not by Bitcoin. But it has to take the blame when it is overbought and then oversold.


Well, it didn't stop people who remembered in 2015  it dropping to $160 from a high of 1250.
And if people are more cautious in future that can be only be a good thing. Bitcoin shouldn't have gone anywhere near 20K at this stage.

Who's saying this? A good currency cannot be volatile.
It's obvious Bitcoin (and the others) were way overbought. A return to 3000-5000 will restore some sanity.

If there were no markets or people not trying to get rich on it the whole thing would never have gotten started. No one is forced to use Bitcoin. There has to be something to stimulate adoption.
All money is traded anyway.


Why do they use offshore accounts? Or Swiss bank accounts?


The market cap is still tiny. It's still subject to this. This will change. Again not intrinsic to Bitcoin.
Why are so bothered by the whales? Fuck them. They became whales because they held. Hold no matter the volatility and you will be rewarded. The whales can't take your money be force. You only lose it by panic selling.

It went from $200 to $20,000 in three years. That's not impressive?


True but Bitcoin has a habit of coming back repeatedly. And the limited supply and reducing reward to miners guarantees some deflation.

So you concede now that banks are not a safe place to keep money.


All countries have stores of gold.


A long time ago indeed. There's a new and better way now. And free from corruption and money printing.


It's not simply because it's digital. There's no intermediary. The current system only benefits the oligarchies. Not the people.


You don't need all that smoke and mirrors shit with Bitcoin.






You've already conceded money is not safe in a bank. Not all governments are just. Accounts of political dissidents can be frozen for example. The citizens in Cyprus were innocent.


Oh Jesus. Mt Gox was practically a bank. The whole point of Bitcoin is your have sovereignty over your money.
 


And you're a prick. Just stick to arguments.


What about the road out the front of your house how much did you pay for that?
How about the train station, or using buses or trains in general? You really think they make profit from public transport? You think that’s not a huge cost to the state?
How about FBI, CIA, NASA, FDA are you paying for all of these too? Dude you don’t have any fucking idea about the world you are living in.
Yeah healthcare is expensive where you are coz republicans have convinced y’all that public healthcare is socialism. The rest of the developed world has free healthcare and we love it. And yes our taxes pay for it but we don’t pay crazy taxes you might think.
Even in primary school books and uniforms, if any, have to be paid for. Most education is very expensive.


A toll couldn't cover this or congestion charge? Which is often already the case. We don't need taxes for this.


All very expensive.
None of this has nothing to with Bitcoin anyway. I'm not saying do away with government altogether. Just control over our money.


Lol thanks mate I’ll hang on to my paper that I can go down to any shop and buy shit with. You’re the one clinging on to worthless internet coins that can drop to $0 at any moment and the world wouldn’t give a fuck.
Yeah. A ten year bull run. Your paper trash is going down the drain.

Yeah, no more nerds! Oh... ��
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:35:10
Yours is the politically correct viewpoint.
They're the ones not implementing replay protection. There's no moral equivalence here putting millions of peoples' money at risk.
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:54:40
In other words, don't save your money. Consume consume consume. Have you read Brave New World?

Toxic. If ever a word was overused. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:32:34
If it's a bubble then it was overbought. The reasons you stated are excuses for selling or at best just helped to spark selling.
@_date: 2018-07-09 00:59:54
We heard that at $400 before the last halvening.

Value of dollar is being squeezed?
@_date: 2019-09-05 03:32:36


It's not what it was designed for. Anyway - that's up the supermarkets. They get to decide what is money? I think not.

Regular basis my hat. I doubt even half use it regularly. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:57:28
If you mean it's only good for spending how is it any better than cash?
Owning it protects you from inflation and fiat debasement. That's a use.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:57:58


Well, that's the excuse anyway.
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:51:04
You don't need a loan with Bitcoin. Just hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:23:53
They are working on something according to a developer on here.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:05:16
Don't fall off that fence.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:36:25
Like the film industry did against piracy. To little effect.
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:40:36


That's not why gold is valuable. It's even too soft to be used on its own in jewellery.

Your digital godl.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:52:03
That you get upvoted for this shit on here is troubling. No doubt upvotes by regretful buyers.

How on Earth are credit cards totally irrelevant? It's the only option for paying on Amazon at present. Users seeing Bitcoin as an option will not make them cast aside their cards.


That's conjecture. Enough people need to own BTC for it to be any good to Amazon.
@_date: 2018-07-21 12:12:36
I’ve seen one. Or Moto least. 
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:41:06
Because Bitcoin is a money. And it was the first to do this. It wasn't riding on something else's shoulder.
Your alt has a token to make money for its creators, that's why.
And fair criticism is not tribalism.
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:13:13
It could apply to people still in profit.
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:08:21
They were burnt in 2013-5 also. (Although those who bought at ATHs then and held were rewarded.) People have short memories and there are always new buyers. Bitcoin doesn’t have to do anything anyway. Bitcoin makes inflation evident.

No 5 dollar wrench attack will work if you use multisig or timelock.
@_date: 2019-09-06 22:01:52
The misguided perception that Bitcoin can be duplicated with "forks" or can be bettered by shitcoin with X feature(s) that Bitcoin doesn't have.
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:20:00
Probably used a few rubles also.
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:43:26
Now you're being silly. Where are the flying cars or time machines or anything near them?
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:19:51

Its chart v BTC in the last 9 years looks miserable though.
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:02:25
It's all about people. The price hasn't fallen because a flaw was found in Bitcoin or some similar such reason. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:32:35
Sarcasm, I hope.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:11:14

Perhaps he meant you are dependent on third parties.
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:55:59
If you mean people trust fiat despite it not being trustworthy. Sure there are a lot of stupid people. Many don't trust fiat. Or Bitcoin wouldn't be $6000.

There's room though for an anti-establishment view of traditional investments and finance even if it's naive or jokey.

I thought people were supposed to be buying because of the fork (free money)?
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:00:14
Yet if a price keeps dropping on a chart what do you assume will happen next?

When Bitcoin was cheaper? Kind of proves its point.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:19:02
To catch the next ATH? That's a different matter. It could take as long as you suggested.
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:05:28
Most of the other examples went up as fast as they fell and the one in 2014-15 lasted over a year.

What did you expect after 20x rise in 12 months?
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:56:04
No, but with a limited supply which halves every 4 years it's almost a certainty the price will go up. The last 9 years attest to this.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:39:11
Well Facebook is the pits nowadays so that's not saying much.
Anyway, switching between social networks carries no financial risk so this analogy needs to be shot and buried. Also your statement is highly presumptuous.

Without "hoarding" there would be no rise, or very little. It works both ways.

Quite right.

It is now.
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:07:09


Honestly I'm sick of hearing sob stories about people who bought at the ATH. Fuck them if there were stupid enough to buy in a very obvious bubble.
The vast majority did buy before then and price will hold at some point because they bought low enough.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:59:18
So why should that affect Bitcoin with 90% hashrate?
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:21:30
Not against the bolivar it hasn’t. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:30:26


You have a source for that? And is less susceptible to spam, quick changes in the protocol etc?
You keep insisting on a USP as if other coins are anywhere close to Bitcoin. You can buy any other crypto with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:49:18
Can there really be many who have done this?
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:45:50
Why is living with your a parents a problem in this case? Surely you will save money.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:45:19
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:47:11
No. Better to leave it to the likes of Grayscale or Coinbase. Users doing it is a bit scammy.
@_date: 2019-09-17 22:13:04
What has evidence to do with it? We know the dollar went off the gold standard at least 50 years ago. Or you think there's no evidence for that happening? I don't think we need a meme.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:35:46
If you mean the chips. They are developing their own now though.
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:48:38
Whatever makes the actual writing process easier.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:45:10
And to think Bitcoin has been called Monopoly money by detractors.
I see the usual misguided defenders of the banks are here in force.
The dollar and other fiat currencies are highly susceptible to a change in supply either by being printed or digitally - whether it is common or not.
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:22:03
Probably used a few rubles also. But no will know because they are truly untraceable.

Yes! *coughs*

Waiting for a billion tps.

No we don’t. It’s purely theoretical. And at this stage looking very unlikely. It’s no longer 2013.

You have a source for that?
Being able to send money to anyone anywhere at anytime changes things.

Air conditioning in buildings that should have been designed to not need it is doing far far more harm.

@_date: 2019-09-02 01:14:28


And sharding.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:09:57
That's not an argument. Tell me then smart aleck why they would opt for Bitcoin if they already have a credit card. Anyway when Microsoft adopted it the price barely budged.
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:24:15
Three years from when? Bitcoin started rising in early 2015. I’m hopeless? I’m not the one defending shitcoins.

@_date: 2018-07-17 01:38:41
Nothing delusional about the chart. The line maybe.
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:26:09
But the papers were physical obviously. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:23:23
Technically it may be the same, but that doesn't mean it's just as difficult to change the supply or block size. If it's too centralized this can be accomplished more easily.
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:37:38


And no source. Take with a pinch of salt.
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:28:02
Yes, that's what I did not say.
@_date: 2018-07-04 20:38:21

He said "trust". He didn't say "trusted".
Not to be trusted meaning the supply can be changed at anytime and your assets can be seized at anytime.

Who said penis sucking was involved ?
You’re going to be disappointed. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:51:50


It was the world's first decentralized ledger. There are other coins but that does not make Bitcoin less unique. Why use them and not Bitcoin? Who says they won't be quickly supplanted?


Just like with crypto.
Gold does not have mass adoption - if you count use by the public. They have jewellery but they don't really see that as an asset.

@_date: 2019-09-05 21:07:51
And even if you admit Bitcoin is best as a store of value they won't accept that either.
@_date: 2019-09-18 19:56:40

@_date: 2019-09-21 20:51:34
You should be grateful I debated you and not just reported you for alt shilling.
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:38:23
Well there are Apple ones, therefore...
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:28:57


At least you're under no delusions. There are mixing services for Bitcoin anyway and have been for years if you want to risk it.
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:35:16
Where's the third party in this case? You're clutching at straws.
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:31:38
I don't trust the euros I exchanged for bitcoin 5 years ago.
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:12:18
I think Bitcoin is more akin to TCP/IP. Some of those examples were companies and websites.

Try handling and verifying it though.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:41:08
Wouldn't be big news anyway.

Bitcoin *has* risen at least 600% last three or four years.

NSFW and not suitable for here.
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:08:08
You have a good point, if could have been better expressed. Grouping Bitcoin in with the alts gives them a kind of validity. Like saying Tennis and three-legged race are sports.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:24:07
You trust a third party with all your money?
@_date: 2019-09-15 22:22:16

@_date: 2019-09-01 04:23:22
Huh? They are still being mined.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:15:07
Most people. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 19:54:09
Calm down. Bitcoin gives people back full control of their money.
I'd rather "libertarian pseudoeconomics trash" than governmental ass kissing.

Why not? At least with many alts. It must be very wearying for bagholders to see their shitcoins are still in a bear market in relation to Bitcoin.

Nor can you pay with a foreign reserve currency or gold.
Sell for fiat and send to your bank account? It's not rocket science.
Or use a Bitcoin debit card.
Anyway, if you bought the Bitcoin recently why would you want to?
If you bought it a few years ago it will have appreciated enough to make paying the rent easier.

Because better tech will not be enough. You can't better the network, effect, the security, the immutability and so on. It's more a money thing than tech.

The gold could vaporize. Or be inaccessible. And you're forgetting Bitcoin can be backed up. I could have the same wallet on a hundred Trezors. Or the seed in my head. I suggest you drop the "which one is more indestructible" angle and concentrate on the hacking.
The care and guarding of gold is controlled by computers at some level. And if I've already smelted the gold and recast it how will it be found as it cannot be traced like Bitcoin?
Bitcoin per se has never been hacked. Saying its theoretical is like saying gold could be synthezied, theoretically.
@_date: 2019-09-14 06:37:16

Well, thank you for your incredible service to the newbs. Maybe you should be more concerned about the billions of people who have fiat currency forced upon them. A scam if ever there was one. No one is forced to use Bitcoin. 
Everybody’s money should be beyond reach. It doesn’t matter what they’ve done. You can’t have half measures with something like this. The fact you’re suggesting banks can seize certain person’s money makes nonsense of your earlier claims about money being safe in a bank. 
I didn’t say Bitcoin prevents fraud. I said better prevention from being stolen is better than worrying about getting it back again. Although properly secured your money is far safer in Bitcoin than in a bank. 


Are you being intentionally obtuse? You know debt collectors can have funds seized from your account? And Cyprus has done so?


Printing money with abandon and relying on third parties is a million times better - only for banks and governments. The people get shafted. 
Why don’t you stop kissing the governmental ass?

Anyway, anyone who bought in the first nine years or so are still in the black.

@_date: 2019-09-17 21:26:21


Of course it is. And you're confusing exchange rate with security. And so far it's far outperformed fiat currencies anyway.


Not true. I wouldn't trust a bank with a large amount of money. It can be seized by them or the government. Transactions can be stopped or delayed. Inflation is enough for them to steal your money anyway. Country doesn't have to break down.


You must be new here. Bitcoin can be traced. Every transaction. Fiat is used far more for laundering. And the likes of HSBC have laundered far more than the value of all BTC in existence.


Properly secured a bitcoin wallet is far more secure and untouchable than any Swiss bank or offshore account. There's no third party.


Ethereum has no monetary policy. As money it's garbage. And too centralized.

I can't take this comment seriously.
This is gold's only strength over Bitcoin actually - its fungibility. 
You're being equally totally ridiculous to suggest that Bitcoin is likely to be hacked.

Your box cannot send value to anyone anywhere at anytime without fear of seizure. It cannot be stored and transferred easily (without fear of seizure). It's not a hedge against inflation. Its genuine-ness cannot easily be verified. How can you prove with ease and beyond doubt that your box is the same one Ferrari (for whatever reason) wants? No one wants your box anyway. There are plenty of boxes.

Not being narrow. I have alts. Just being realistic. An altcoin being supposedly more "advanced" may not be enough. Bitcoin has the head start and it can just incorporate the notable features of alts.

Why would they increase the supply? There’s absolutely no financial incentive to do so. It’s becoming harder and harder to change Bitcoin’s fundamentals. Even the block size. 
As for gold, what if someone finds a way to synthesize it?

The several million per cent figure is assuming a starting price of one cent. It’s up a lot more than that. 
In two weeks? Really? Are you sure about that?
From a year even it’s still up v the dollar.

We don't need that shit. Fiat money can be laundered anyway and is untraceable.


Legal measures can be taken. Pressure put on the criminals. But, yes, the money shouldn't be easy to access. No doubt if it were an ETH ICO a hard fork could be done to retrieve the funds. :-P~~~ 


And if they demand gold which they will store themselves? [Are you against gold ownership also?](


We now have governments, banking and stable currencies. US government even recognised in the early 1920s the economy was having too many crises and created the Fed to help calm things down. For the good of everyone.
We should have evolved beyond the nanny state being charge of our money. 100 years ago was a disaster - countries started going off the gold standard.


It happened to me. And unjustifiably, to make it worse.


Half of those things are already paid for with tolls and fees. Stop spending billions on defence and we wouldn't have to pay taxes. Although with the US still $22 trillion in debt they'd still insist on taxes probably.


It's to further enrich the rich.

The initial creators of summercoin arent involved with navcoin anymore, the community survived and is still working on it with new developers. Those developers get paid via navs community fund. A portion of the minted coins get locked away and can only be used after the community has agreed to do so.

The fact is there was a big enough community of people who wanted bigger blocks and a supposedly more cash-like Bitcoin. No one had to bow to it. It could have gone to zero. BCH is not considered Bitcoin by the vast majority and that is reflected in the price.

Who decides who is law-abiding? And as I demonstrated, money can be seized unfairly.
Prevent the crime and don't compromise on trustless money.


Proven not to work for governments who want to be able to afford to wage war etc. Gold was holding them back.


I'm not denying most of that. But the things you listed are due to tech and infrastructure, not benefits of fiat currencies. Anyway, you have fees, txs can be seized or held, ATMs can close at 10PM in some countries due to fears of being robbed when seen using a card, bank websites can be offline in the early hours for maintenance, can send money only to a handful of countries.
And wouldn't it be better if your card wasn't used fraudulently in the first place? Security on PCs etc is still very basic because people just think "we'll refund their money", which is why Bitcoin can be susceptible. Security has to be improved significantly.


There are electric cars now. Fiat is a model T.


Keep hanging around the subs hoping to come across someone who does get how economies and the world works and they can explain to me how they see a bitcoin future working. But seems everyone in here who is keen on bitcoin has zero understanding how an economy, government or country already works and just thinks anarchy is a great idea. Complete fucking morons, I’m sure we have monkeys that are smarter than you.
Monaco and the UAE manage without income tax. How do they manage, Iamverysmart?
I went on to say anyway the money needs replacing not necessarily the governments.
You can still have your taxes anyway while the government continues to spend trillions on defence and to wipe your ass because you can't looks after yourself - if that's what you want.

Basically you are saying we should not have sovereignty over our money - so we should just leave it at that. I disagree vehemently. Saying criminals might abuse it is not a reason to deny the rest of us this right. They can store their funds in gold or cash in their own possession anyway. Or offshore accounts at least. So they will have control over their money one way or another.


Most countries went off the gold standard between 1918 and 1930. Right after the Great War. The current system just gets by with tinkering with interest rates and the supply and so. Bitcoin just works.


Garbage yourself. Did I say otherwise? How do you access your account at that point?


Just as yours had nothing to do with fiat. Bitcoin could use this infrastructure.


To seem to be happy getting your card used fraudulently. Stop idiocies like putting the details on a card (as Apple started doing) and this will happen less - this how arrogant Visa and others are. Then refunds won't be necessary. And you won't have to cancel your card and wait for a new one.


There's nothing to stop Bitcoin at some point using the infrastructure fiat and credit cards are using. There are already Bitcoin debit cards.


You mean tax on goods? Didn't I pretty much make that point about toll fees and so on? Obviously goods and services would be more expensive. You were clearly talking about income tax. Don't backtrack.


Better that they spend less. And you know Bitcoins are divisible up 8 decimal places don't you? Theoretically more with a fork.

You're being downvoted (supposedly) for calling the hardest money yet devised shit.
Vendor acceptance is no criterium for judging if something is money. Do shops in your country accept foreign currencies or gold?
They only accept the local currency because it is enforced by government fiat. Hence fiat currency.

No denying that. But it's not a feature intrinsic to Bitcoin. The market cap is tiny and easily swayed, and there are many noobs investing in comparison to gold.

That's the way it should be. Prevent the fraud in the first place.

That's not what I said. Fiat already makes it easy to break the law. Bitcoin is traceable as you admitted yourself. Fiat money can be laundered.


The Bahamas has just been devastated. Try to be more topical. These criminals have offshore accounts anyway.
No, of course it shouldn't be hard forked. You're obviously familiar with Ethereum and the DAO. Skip it. Prevent theft and you won't have to worry about getting funds back.


I thought it was a ransom situation?!? Aren't all those kids going to be executed?


Of course they shouldn't - but not at the expense of compromising Bitcoin.


Governments did it because they would be able to afford to wage war ad infinitum. They keep the gold and the populace is stuck with pieces of paper with no supply limit.


This is funny coming from a luddite like you. Bitcoin is a spaceship and fiat is a horse and cart.


It wouldn't matter if it were justifiable or not. In Bitcoin it would be safe. Anyway, I knew was pointless recounting an anecdote. Cyprus and the Venezuelan gold are enough to make the point.


They have money to spend trillions on nukes though? Even hospitals in the states at least cost a fortune. What exactly is free there?


USDBTC has dropped several million per cent since Bitcoin's inception. Which is the more awful and who is the brainwashed one?

Not at all. Maybe it's a phrase you're a bit too fond of. 
Having the price factored in is not a result of the halving. Merely traders speculating on what will happen. You would expect a real reduction in the reward to push the price up a bit. It didn't happen. What is it, almost $3 now? Just a few cents more than it was in January. Zowie. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:45:32
The price would be 0? Not so. You're ignoring Bitcoin's use as a store of value, as a speculative asset etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:25:11


Since the price is near $7000 obviously they are being adopted. Putting the price all down to speculation is disingenuous. Obviously many feel that their funds are safer in a money beyond government control. Anyway, whether they are widely adopted or not is beside the point. You're putting the cart before the horse.

Bitcoin started from nothing with zero expectations. BCH is a clone riding on its shoulders and therefore is too centralized having being seized control at a late stage. It has no network effect and barely any hashrate. Plus the way it started is not right if you want a fair monetary policy.

I think you don’t know what you’re talking about. The quote you start with- how is that relevant to Visa or what Visa is capable of?
The pdf I linked to says:
If we use an average of 300 bytes per bitcoin transaction and assumed unlimited block sizes, an equiva- lent capacity to peak Visa transaction volume of 47,000/tps would be nearly 8 gigabytes per Bitcoin block, every ten minutes on average.
I didn’t say block sizes per day. Clearly I meant if you did the math that it would add up to (over) 1000gb per day if 8 gb per block. 
The original point stands. Bch would need absurdly big blocks to compete with visa. Lightning or something else is the way to go.

A lower price will be attractive to some and a higher price to others. Someone will always be happy. Not saying I am but some are relishing the lower prices believe it or not.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:08:58
It's about 8000. And many thought it was going to 1-3000.
Do what disingeneous means? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:07:45
So why did the price rise $2000 last couple of weeks despite many thinking it was going to 5k or lower?

Obviously you don't invest if you don't know what you are doing. No one in their right mind thinks Bitcoin is ready for Joe Bloggs yet. Although I think you are bordering on hyperbole with your doom laden scenarios.
Funds on hardware wallets are recoverable with seeds. Just keep a few copies. Gold, sure, is durable, but why keep valuable art or anything susceptible to fire you might as well argue.
Bitcoin is more akin to gold than fiat currencies. It can fill niches the yen can't.

That’s an old draft. It says 8 GB per block every 10 minutes.

A nine year rally? 
Gold can drop in value once you've bought some. Not as much granted - but it won't go up nearly as much either.
Gold can be much more easily seized (even governments have been none to do it) and usually has to entrusted to a third party. Plus of course it's untraceable once melted. At least you can track your Bitcoins if stolen. 
You can't keep blaming Bitcoin for the nascent infrastructure. Bitcoin itself has never been hacked.
And I would question it's so easy to steal Bitcoins if the user password-protects the wallet (using anti-keylogging input of course). And writes down the password in a few physical places. Can't be that hard.

@_date: 2015-11-14 16:00:03
Do I really have to elaborate? It's also a commodity and a store of value. It's use as a currency is pretty limited at the moment - due to lack of acceptance, etc.

Then so do your dismissals.
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:19:18
...a story not about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:27:14
Like religions don't use violence to enforce their ideologies...
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:25:32
Perhaps he meant as a store of value.
@_date: 2016-10-09 03:13:53
Why the tag? It is secure. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:37:06
Can't always be wrong. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 14:54:41
None of the dumps are artificial of course, huh?
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:11:12
Arguably they already are superfluous. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:12:22
It's more like vice versa. It's prized as jewellery because gold is rare.
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:29:48
Eu acho que nao.
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:13:04
I said "as soon as it happened".
@_date: 2016-05-17 20:12:05
That's Classic development, surely?
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:21:34
He's mentally unstable if he has. He's had an easy ride.
@_date: 2017-05-16 02:33:41
So open to manipulation due to its complexity.
@_date: 2016-05-23 06:46:22
This is true. E-commerce perhaps would've been a better example. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:51:01
Just needs to be easy to use.
@_date: 2015-03-22 13:28:26
You did what?
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:49:17
Yep. And "shi" makes you think of "shit".
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:49:03
And yet Apple Pay is often considered (wrongly) a rival to Bitcoin on here.
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:28:14
My bank's site is serviced in the early hours.

People. Not silly people. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:59:06
And is censorship-resistant. Even Ethereum has doubts in that area.

"The blockchain", i.e. blockchains.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:33:47
Why? He's no longer an important player.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:14:51
Not for that old joke I won't.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:03:20
And others. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:19:30
What about voat? Did that catch on? Not much mention of it nowadays.
@_date: 2016-10-09 14:57:46
Although it doesn't occur to many here that Apple might be full of nerds. Nerds like stuff like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-27 07:54:44
Yes. He's wrong. There were a few posts about eth on r/bitcoin lately and no one on the mod side batted an eyelid. Try shilling though and it's a different matter. Unless you're on r/btc. Over there it's de rigeuer. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:36:53
If you mean own. No way. Gotta be more than that. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:14:35
Perhaps but at least you have to option to or not.

@_date: 2018-04-20 15:50:50
"Prepare the anal probe!"
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:20:39
It's virtually what he has said in recent interviews.
@_date: 2016-05-29 08:16:53
Downvoted by r/btc-cers no doubt and ignoramuses unfamiliar with ISO currency code practices. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:07:55
Because it's predominantly about Segwit, not shilling LTC.
@_date: 2015-11-17 09:20:17
Have you a source for this?
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:48:51
The voice of treason. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:31:42
A false idol.
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:12:40
He might favour it as a gold substitute, in which case the blocksize not too important.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:53:00
Not really. You should've done it when it was (for months) at 220.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:44:40


Bullshit. So why look for even more exposure?
@_date: 2016-05-29 11:49:39
I'll use whatever the fuck I want.

Bitcoin finishes higher after crashes.
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:43:09
Halving didn't have much affect on Litecoin as soon as it happened. Appeared to be priced in. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:42:32
What is this shit?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:56:08
Drama queen. So is Bitcoin better now because its market cap is higher?
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:43:15
Silly comparison. At least the Model T is locked up securely and won't have to be bailed out if stolen.
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:51:46
Orwellian names (I presume you mean 1984) are usually euphemistic (e.g. Ministry of Love).
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:44:51
Most of the 21 million will mined though in the next 30 years or so. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 12:45:12
People will not risk switching though, so don't expect it to supplant Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-31 22:42:02
Shrem is not that fat. Anyone hirsute though will do.

"Censorship-free" but I can post only every 9 minutes there.
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:15:46
That's not much of a raise.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:18:54
That’s been ling dismissed as FUD. Trump is using his own phone all the time to tweet. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:39:17
They've been weeding out all the weak hands (amateurs).
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:28:34
The bad variety. Dump to follow.  
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:46:15
As opposed to an established one like MtGox? Age is no guarantee. At least Gemini is insured and doing everything by the book etc. Anyway, are you proposing we don't trade during a bull market? Get real. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:01:52
But why?
@_date: 2015-11-14 00:11:00
Get poor quick - when they panic sell instead of holding.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:52:38
I don't doubt he had ideals.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:40:54
No, warnings. You thought the bubble would last forever?
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:03:14
Dave has more sense. The sloth wants to panic sell because the current price is lower than when bought?
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:02:10
I don't think that's why it went back up.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:24:48


If it wasn't blocks the alts would be boasting about some other supposed advantage.
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:23:04
How long was it at 1200?
@_date: 2015-11-03 03:34:19
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:36:41
Based on a 9 year chart. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:27:36
Obviously some fork that calls itself Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-13 19:51:09
I don't think people were talking about the States.
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:41:19
Everyone knew it was a bubble and that it wouldn't last. How many actually bought at 1200 anyway?
@_date: 2015-11-26 15:23:55
That's not strictly speaking internet speed.
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:36:54
What's wrong with argument 1? What are the other side basing their arguments on?
@_date: 2016-05-07 15:04:59
It went up 9000% the year after the last halving. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:20:27
...a very tenuous one.
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:38:49
Obviously Myspace wasn't big enough. Anyway, a few rebuttals:
* Facebook was not based on Mysapce as the altcoins are based on Bitcoin.
* Those social sites only really need to worry about gaining users, the altcoins need to win over venture capitalists, investors, programmers etc.
* Social network sites are free services. Little risk switching.
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:09:15


That doesn't make it OK.
@_date: 2015-11-21 03:43:10
And who's making the US? Cant keep blaming the west for their problems. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 14:15:25
Why should we believe anecdotes from one anonymous person?
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:02:05
A week or two? I don't think so. A few minutes more like.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:49:43
Or $1000. You never know.
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:57:38
It will - at some point. Hopefully at a high enough figure.
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:32:40
What could happen? Nothing. It will keep going anyway.
@_date: 2015-11-06 00:12:39
I have a problem with this meme. Wasn't the king wrong?
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:00:29
It was at 500 for, like, several minutes. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:00:03
Oh no, the jinx. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:24:59
Hitler was elected.
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:19:57
There are always police outside this embassy.
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:43:41
Because of Gemini, I presume, not because of a $10 rise.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:51:36
Not so different. Two coins could also be the result. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:10:34
I understand some Portuguese. They just described it as a virtual currency, which doesn't really mean anything.
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:47:57
You are assuming he meant buying just one Bitcoin at $30. What if it's $10,000 worth 
@_date: 2015-10-10 03:33:38
Maybe it's from an alternate Earth. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:06:06
There's no *easiest* way? This doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:11:58
And yet I can send you a 1000 bitcoins now and no regulations can stop it.
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:18:45
Not if they're secured properly and in your own hands.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:39:05
How is it being hypocritical?
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:03:22
His fellow skeptic Michael Shermer mentioned Bitcoin in a tweet a while back. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:54:43
Rare comic books and stamps.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:33:49
The Queen has no power. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:08:32
Maybe they mine also?
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:58:48
And the other half making a bigger deal of it than it deserves. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:27:24
Probably had nothing to back it up.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:53:28
Also, and this is assuming the price coupling with the major alts continues, I can't see ETH going below 300 for long - as would it probably would if BTC dropped. It was 300 for ages last year. There should be good support.
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:52:44
And yours is sophistry. Look at a nine year chart, that will give my argument context.
@_date: 2016-05-30 02:36:55
And eth supply is not limited. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:16:55
So buy a few thousand.
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:46:09
They need to be scarce otherwise what's the point? Would you adopt the leaf as legal tender as in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy? Of course not. They're too plentiful. Bitcoins get their value from their scarcity and their utility.
@_date: 2015-03-20 14:44:51
Why do any of them have?
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:53:51
Store of value. Hedge against inflation. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:46:06
A correction. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:54:16
He imitated GA in a video also?
@_date: 2016-10-31 13:29:02
An exchange is just like a bank. If a bank is robbed it's not the currency's fault. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 01:11:13
Oddball name.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:07:22
I had considered the less available content and swapping arguments but thought these were not deal-breakers. Anyway, I agree with your reservations.
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:16:16


You're storing value with it.
If you want to pay me in Bitcoin why should I want to accept it? It has to be desirable. People must want to own it. No one is under any legal obligation to accept it as payment.
It's all very well to say spend it - but if no one wants to own it it's useless.


Who have a source for this?


What an alt? Don't make me laugh. Bitcoin's network effect is so strong that a coin adding a few features is not going to cut it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:42:48
Not always behind people’s backs. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:43:25
Owning it in my book is using it. If no one owns or desires it it cannot be used. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:08:24
Because you fell for r/btc propaganda?
@_date: 2015-03-13 11:11:24
They're not against people who supply costumes, no. :-P
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:37:30
They don't really explain what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:27:01
Appears to be instant. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 22:58:43
Letter-writing didn't though. Parcels and bills etc. still need to be physical. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 02:13:30
Bitcoin is not centralized in that way.
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:30:17
Even all the money-laundering isn't helping.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:46:28
They use it themselves and so also want it to succeed?
@_date: 2016-10-09 03:12:35
They're not blocking it either. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:39:06
Segwit and lightning will fix that. Spare me the "lets blame Core" rhetoric.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:47:55
I think he's just being tongue-in-cheek.
@_date: 2015-11-15 20:19:16
Up a point. Why do kidnappers etc. ask for unmarked non-consecutive bills?
@_date: 2016-10-11 14:45:45
It ain't nothing. It's been stable for weeks.
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:53:49
You know fuck all. The queen has no power. Hitler's party was elected democratically. Trump is already a liability. This Assange story doesn't belong here.
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:54:52
There's nothing to stop doing this with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:06:51
At least attests to its immutability.
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:17:05
All the more reason. If it had the same properties there'd be no point replacing gold. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:15:27
Baidu was massively overplayed. Had little effect.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:38:27


That sounds like trolling.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:54:38
If and when it's implemented.
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:05:43
Gavin uses Reddit also.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:18:42
Attempted ban.
@_date: 2016-05-19 01:38:39
There's generally only one email. Or that's how it seems. There are many coins and blockchains.
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:59:59
At least it shows there's a demand. ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-05 04:16:34
Blocksize not important if it becomes a gold substitute.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:29:24
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:49:23
Percentage wise. They won't find it so easy to triple when they are above 1000. If they make it that high. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:37:55
I could be wrong but I feel I've seen this screenshot before.
@_date: 2015-11-06 03:12:21
Yeah. It happens all the time. Examples please. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 02:36:21
But they know about internet payments already. Could have gone into it a little bit more in depth. They don't explain the difference between Bitcoin and Monero and Zcash, i.e. more anonymity.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:34:58
OK, so now it is cheaper. Buy more.
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:52:17
If you're preoccupied with the ATH it might not look significant no. Only in the long run will we see if it's significant or not.
@_date: 2016-05-05 04:22:15
He's Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:20:13
Same as usual as far as I can see. Was mostly doom and gloom a month ago anyway. The price rise itself is the hype.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:47:01
Something to cheer Charlie Shrem up today of all days.
@_date: 2016-05-01 03:35:05
A retweet is not necessarily an endorsement. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:41:10
Isn't there a Reddit rule about not using "Breaking" in a title?
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:11:27
Careful or he'll hard fork you out of existence.
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:10:47
So China are buying because they're China?
@_date: 2015-10-30 00:50:04
It wasn't all due to supposed Mt.Gox manipulation. I think the Chinese had a big hand in it the last time also.
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:50:39
And bitcoinity.
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:24:41
Well, at least it was at the price for a while.
@_date: 2015-03-22 03:05:03
This seems to be a hindrance to thieves rather anyone else. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:39:18
The good doctor wasn't into flowery prose.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:46:46
And I asked what else are you going to base it on? Base it on a 9 year chart that clearly shows undeniably a long term upward trend - regardless of big crashes.
The FOMO anytime there's a big rise in price is unreal. Bitcoin is becoming better and better known through pop culture and the news. The next halving is in 2 years or so. I see no reason why the rise shouldn't continue if Bitcoin remains healthy.
edit:added un- to deniably
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:53:23
Didn't the real one post something during the Dorian episode?
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:55:25
Just buy what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:14:09
It'll be ready when it's ready.
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:27:33
Bitcoin is open 24/7.
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:01:45
The masses? What have they to do with it?
@_date: 2016-05-25 00:28:33
They have the best developers. In that sense they own it.
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:39:36
With more coins though. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:02:19
It's doesn't matter if Hitler was not directly elected or not. His country allowed it to happen through democratic means. The Nazi Party was elected. No one is moving goal posts. Don't try to be smart. 
Robert Mugabe was also elected. Talk you way out of that one.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:17:15
Best doesn't matter. Try starting a and see how many subscribers you get. 
(Actually, someone did.)
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:19:46


Why would he? Probably owes money. Or MtGox does.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:34:18
Straw man. I didn’t say he was a genius. He is a billionaire though. And he’s certainly a canny businessman as far as Bitcoin goes. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:47:56
BTC is not available. I see nothing wrong with using XBT, unofficially or not. Not sure why I was downvoted either. Said nothing controversial.
@_date: 2015-03-04 13:43:53
Nice. I think I'd have made the ฿ white so that the name scans more clearly.
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:32:58
You don't know his track record obviously. Price usually plummets when he posts.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:26:16
A nice change from those damn Hitler videos.
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:21:06
is in private mode. heh
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:25:35
Not related to that.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:44:28
Or you could just hold. Those who sold expecting it to drop to 600-700 a few weeks ago now have problems.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:37:07
Or zero, he says. But worth the risk.
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:36:04
Me too. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 05:21:16
Or "Nazis on r/bitcoin have censored my eth pump post". Good idea. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 04:48:56
So much for everyone buying a certain alt instead.
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:38:16


Posted correspondence? Bills and the like yes but hardly anyone is posting missives to their friends and family.


Gold has never gained 20x in 12 months either. The bubble was not intrinsic to Bitcoin. Everyone was buying because they thought it would keep rising then sold because they panicked or they wanted to take rewards.
However, it shares many characteristics with gold.

The halving was enough of a reason. News rarely changes the price like this. If Amazon started accepting it would it rise like this? Never.
And Bitcoin is a very safe haven. There doesn't have to progress so much as censorship resistance and immutabilty.

I didn't downvote you. Eth does not have a fixed supply and is not really designed to be a general use currency or a digital gold. Plus it's currently a lot less secure than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital gold even with the lack of scaling.
@_date: 2016-05-19 01:27:02

You are greatly mistaken. Gold is valued primarily because it's scarce and durable not because it's used in electronics and jewelry.

I'm talking about losing funds very easily. I don't think it's as common as you seem to think.
Storing bitcoins will become easier. How hard is it already to keep a software wallet on your computer and back up the wallet to a few places with a password? Not the most secure way but you're not likely to lose your funds. Or on blockchain.info with 2fa and download a backup of the keys.
Your point about Japan only proves it's better not to have someone tinkering with the supply.

Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust is poised to become the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, with approval and assignment of a ticker symbol by the financial industry’s main self-regulatory body paving the way for trading on an electronic platform operated by OTC Markets Group .
The BIT, which was first launched in 2013 as a private fund for accredited investors with annual incomes greater than $200,000 or assets of more than $1 million, has been racing against a rival offering by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their lawsuit against Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg .
Whereas the competing Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is going through a lengthy Securities and Exchange Commission process to register a formal exchange-traded fund, the BIT as taken a backdoor route to public listing. By exploiting a rule that allows holders of a private fund to sell their shares publicly after a 12-month lockup period and completing a less arduous approval process with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, some of those long-held shares in BIT should soon be available to investors of any income or wealth bracket. The BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which he established last year to hold the digital currency interests of his broker-dealer SecondMarket Inc.

Because there can only be on Bitcoin. As there there can only be one Mona Lisa. You can't make an exact replica and say that is the same thing. Bitcoin had to earn its value. Bcash coasted in on Bitcoin's back, and got onto reputable exchanges like Bitstamp and Gemini because of it.

Why did it make more sense?
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:13:53
Why is a definition required? You think only people who buy or sell with bitcoins are users?

Basically anyone who criticises the Ethereum shenanigans of the last couple of months or buys ETC.

There still can be dips. Even 2017 had them.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:59:38
Not at all. There shouldn’t still be trust in the alts after how much they fell in relation even to Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is the crypto standard. The alts superfluous clones.

Bcash is an altcoin. It's like fooling people into buying fake gold. An assayer will know it's fake gold.


That's not instant, especially with large amounts. And if you have no device you wouldn't be using Bitcoin in the first place.

The bills can be marked but that doesn't necessarily traceable. That's if they are marked to begin with. Cash transcations are invisible. If I give you a dollar and then you give it back to me no one but you and I know that. On the blockchain that transaction would be recorded.
And don't be a cunt.
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:42:58
But you don't say why.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:35:18
It's costs money/energy to mine the coins so I guess that's a foundational price structure.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:25:25
Because everyone should sell all their coins for fiat? God forbid anyone should save money. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:12:26

They are not Bitcoin. They are altcoins. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:43:34


So does Bitcoin. Such as transferring value quickly without a middleman over a network.


What special properties do other coins have which can't be replicated by Bitcoin?
This is what you should ask.
They don't have the security, the network effect, the developers, the infrastructure, the liquidity etc. You only need to look at the dismal bcash coins to see that copying most of the code does not make another Bitcoin.
By the masses I meant the man on the street.

To do what?

What fallacies? Perhaps you could stop using sophomoric arguments.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:21:50
He might not have the nerve to buy sub 3000. If it rises substantially in the future 2500 or 3500 won’t make much difference. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:24:51
I doubt it will drop another 5x.
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:00:08
No one wants your cat's shit, jackass. Even you or your cat. Cook up better arguments.

Hm. It's gone up literally trillions of percent v the pound. Anyway, small market cap is the reason for any volatility. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:14:09
His point is Bitcoin itself is often blamed for hacks. Us dollar is "hacked" the dollar is let off.

Deflationary by design yes. The volatility had nothing to do with anything inherent to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:10:52
In a year then. That’s how long it took to drop. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:04:17
It took me weeks to send 5k in euros to Brazil because they were worried about money laundering etc.

Dodgy design. Could be mistaken for bcash.

Well, you know how to boost morale.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:41:04
Well, if prefer. But the miners produce/are rewarded with the coins which they sell and then which enter the economy. The "wasted" energy you could "backs" Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:08:10
ICOs selling off because of SEC. Plus Faketoshi and others perhaps trying to harm Bitcoin. Plus some owners capitulating. The Bcash situation though should have helped Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:07:58
Thank goodness. A disastrous idea.
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:00:18

@_date: 2018-12-06 03:27:03


That's not the point here.
Everything is prone to $5 wrench attacks but some more than others. Bitcoin a lot less than many.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:49:04
I see what you mean. No, doesn't appear to be an option.
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:20:25
It would cost a lot more to mine than any gold found they might find.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:41:55
Well, presumably the idea is of removing the middleman from storing and transferring your money. That's a good idea.
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:17:32
Depends on if the bottom is already in. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:04:40
You're assuming all holders bought a year ago.
@_date: 2019-05-29 16:22:33
Even starting from 2013 dollar has lost a shitload.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:26:39
So what?
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:32:51
What news? That people are buying?
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:49:24
In other words, don't criticise scamcoins.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:31:54

They don't believe in TA but if Bitcoin is falling in price then they believe in charts.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:46:40
I said it was during a bubble (in 2013). But it so was for Bitcoin and it's higher now.
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:58:59
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:58:24

They'll only want to buy at 30K.
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:05:19
I think it refers more to corrupt bankers and politicians rather than rich guys with guns. White collar criminals often going unpunished or under-punished for crimes that would land a common thief in jail for millennia if his sentence was adjusted to the amount that his well-off friends defrauded.
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:12:12
You’re always guaranteed of having something to put in the trolley but otherwise,,, yeah, a rip off. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:01:51
Because it fell almost as much as it did in 2014-15? But let's see...
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:33:25
And then blame Bitcoin if it crashes.

If buying now. Not from mid 2017 or so.

Prove it's not a coincidence, of course.
Quite serious.

It's been assayed. Supposedly anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:52:13
True. Your concern should be to get as many Bitcoins as possible, not their current value.
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:35:07
Very true. Bitcoin owes them nothing. Those complaining about the crash need to look at themselves or like your be patient and wait for better times. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:16:50
pets.com went bankrupt. Bitcoin is as healthy as ever. One was a company the other a payment mechanism. Bitcoin has a history of recovering.

Nobody is expecting a quick rebound. And those figures, especially ETH seem over pessimistic. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:18:39
You're just as bad as the moon boys. You think because the price has dropped it will drop forever.
How am I being overly bullish anyway? I said it COULD go to 1200.

I’m not sure it’s a good sign. Bitcoin only should start a rally.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:25:30
Why would this harm the price? And Trace Mayer is a Bitcoin uber-bull.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:51:20
Because there are more users and the miners get fewer coins as a reward. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:39:28
I didn’t say Bitcoin wouldn’t achieve new highs. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:24:48

He's right. If you suck at trading just hodl.
Oh, and try not to buy at the tail end of a bubble. DCA perhaps.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:26:12


Optimistic bottom? Haha. You're having a laugh. What's your source? Your butt?
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:51:29
Ivanka is not a hag.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:51:09
You're assuming every held or didn't sell at a profit. Since the price went down obviously not.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:05:31
If they were true holders they would have had the nerve to get in sooner.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:58:54
He's seen things you people wouldn't believe...
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:02:34
Why only now if that was the case?
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:03:22
He has called it a technological tour de force in the past. And since when has asking a question constituted "badgering"?
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:40:54
mercadobitcoin was bigger, no?
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:54:22
Still better than an exchange.

Moronic comparison. Your cat's shit is not rare, fungible, verifiable, censorship resistant etc.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:31:31
It doesn’t do gold any harm. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:18:27
His analogy is a good one. Digital images cannot be rare. Bitcoin introduced digital rarity. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:46:40


It may be but I think it's been blown way out of proportion, mostly by people (I'm not saying you) who think miners are simply needlessly solving math problems. The waste as I said elsewhere is not intrinsic to Bitcoin. Push more miners to use solar etc.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:42:20
Ha, Look at Ethereum and a few others.
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:18:46
I speet on your puny 20k.
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:44:56
Bitcoin loses on fungibility though. For now.

Self-driving cars are here now. You're the one who introduced the inane car analogy.
Look at the all time chart, wiseacre. This is a long term game. Obviously you don't buy at ATHs though. Ask those who bought between 2009 and 2016, early 2017 even, if they are suckers.
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:43:36
Unless you bought 2009-early 2017.

@_date: 2018-12-10 19:57:40
Because the Euro has lost several million per cent v Bitcoin in 10 years?
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:09:24
Yeah, don't hold your coins, put them on an exchange. /s
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:04:31
Owning it is using it. You’re escaping the traditional financial system. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:00:43
It's not to be taken that literally. 
Anyway there's no doubt the rich are treated differently when they do something wrong. Fraudulent bankers may get a rap on the knuckles, a common shoplifter may get prosecuted, certainly their crime will not be considered glamorous.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:10:24
If it was so minor why change it?

Not necessarily.
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:00:49
It was still not certain then the previous ATH would be reached again. And the bear market was still fresh in the memory.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:27:37
Tree fiddy
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:12:42
News doesn’t affect the market. If it’s rising it’s rising. And if it’s dropping it’s dropping. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:58:24
No, it's not. 
Most alts are as low again as they were two years ago or even three. Not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:02:41
Some analysts were predicting 1500 though.
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:44:13
Just a rumor.
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:13:25
the divine and sole purpose of all alt coins is to enrich their creators.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:15:32
His butt.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:23:31
No, 200k at least. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:53:27
Don’t blame Bitcoin for scammy websites.

We ain't 'fraid o' no crash.

For the future?
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:51:02
Couldn't you put these onto one post? They're littering up the front page.
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:58:30
Looks like you’re nitpicking just for the sake of nitpicking . For example an exchange is just another bank. It’s not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:25:03
Probably panic sold at 10 cents.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:01:31
It’s relative hashrate is higher though. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:58:02
So poor you don't know how to hold a fork properly.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:51:55
Probably isn't but makes me suspect it's fake.
@_date: 2019-05-29 18:56:49
You shouldn’t have bought shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:16:28
I'm no buttcoiner. You seem to think finding a fault (if it even is a fault) with Bitcoin makes me a Buttcoiner.
I'm a Bitcoin maximalist if anything.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:47:51
May take a few years but yes. Certainly 12K anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:59:08
Yeah, just put them in cold storage and forget.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:10:52
Try being less fixated on the price. Bitcoin works just fine. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:24:00
Looks tacky for After Effects
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:35:46
More like 2016.
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:18:45
Where did you read that? They are pseudonymous. And it’s not the entire draw. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:22:40
I would wait to see if it goes a fair bit lower or for an uptrend.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:15:06


That would still be taken place within the traditional financial system. You seem to think Bitcoin is just a currency. It's the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:36:38
I bought in 2013. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:31:42
Yes, but as I pointed out elsewhere, at least the posioner can be found much more easily. And those things you mentioned are usually regulated or monitored.
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:54:16
Another bail out for the ETH crowd.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:25:31
The nodes control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:07:30
I think you're just reading the title. And there's a lot not in the white paper. The 21M limit for example.
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:51:33


And what's wrong with that?
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:29:48
Also where are you supposed to keep the dollars waiting for the price of btc to drop? Doesn’t this go against the whole idea of guarding your own money. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:47:40
I find that hard to believe.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:26:26
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:46:12
Thread and scissors very artfully displayed.
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:22:26
100 divided by 20 is 5. So you suggested it might drop 5 times more. Maybe you're the confused one.
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:43:35
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:45:06
Not easier to sell at 18,000?

Riiiight. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:30:58
Only on here would a comment like this be downvoted. Never mind these asses.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:09:18
Exchanges banned in China. Bitcoin still alive. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:16:59
It’s in the tweet. Someone posted it here also. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:28:15
Sounds awfully vague. So vague to highly improbable.
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:08:15
Define hack in this case.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:15:00
Why would that stop you? Software piracy is illegal and no one cares.
@_date: 2019-05-24 05:36:57
Cute. But why are these things upvoted far more than serious content?
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:12:10
That's what you're supposed to do.
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:20:55
Look at the ten year chart. Obviously some times are better to buy than others. Not everyone can win.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:43:29
More likely now though.
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:21:45
Not between cryptos it’s not. Bigger market cap means more users.

I don’t agree with the last paragraph. It’s not that simple.

You assume they only a Bitcoin and nothing else.

Too late. :-P

Even Ver and co. with all their coins couldn't compete.

They should have just bought a handful and try to understand it first. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:10:09
It was oversold. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:50:02


If people consider it a bank alternative then it's as high as it deserves to be.

@_date: 2018-12-18 23:26:57
Ah, ok. I thought you bought around 2012 or still had a chance to buy then.

@_date: 2018-12-12 02:56:12
Now who's being too precise?
Anyway, it went 100x recently after recovering from a three year bear market. Nothing to stop it doing that several times.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:29:58
It’s not 95% down. And those who bought years ago don’t care.

Did he? He owns some doesn't he?

11 months? Pah!
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:18:42
And why should the price go up apart from bubbles? Because fiat is losing value year by year.
How is it ignorant? I don't trust fucking banks.

These things can be made fool proof with good interface design.
@_date: 2018-12-01 04:12:31
That's your dogmatic opinion. What make you think Bitcoin can usurp Visa and others anyway? There are already satisfactory ways to pay for things. Bitcoin's strength lies in it being a censorship-resistant distributed ledger.

When they have the sense you mean? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:47:25
Well, I did give an extreme example. Point was there was nothing to stop it from happening. And could be done with impunity. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:54:19


Why? Apart from it be wrongfully attributed.
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:53:14

Naive. The FBI can do that.

It's where we ask you why you invested more than you could to lose. And if you did why you expect a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:30:14
They summarise in the tweets though.
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:29:51
You're suggesting that I want it though. I don't. But holding sufficient Bitcoin would mitigate it. And I didn't say "I", I say "you" as in "one wouldn't care".
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:20:49
That's what I thought anyway. But with no price info can't be sure what he's trying to say.
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:47:31
How with no electricity? Face to face?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:46:23
At least you know it won't be hard forked out of existence. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:43:45


You mean dumping?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:40:20
People are buying because the price is rising. The technology is far from ready. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:32:49
Ok: entire history. How much has Bitcoin risen in 7 years v the pound? 
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:08:56
Like using Concorde to go to the corner shop as someone once put it. I may be paraphrasing.
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:05:30
Isn't Coinbase insured?
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:10:52
Politically it may not be considered money. Technically it still is.




Gold *fell* 12% last summer. If you're so smart fill in the blanks if I make a typo.
Ethereum's rise is not an argument. It's piggy-backing on Bitcoin. Anyway it's fallen 93% this year.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:06:32
If it kills all the shitcoins it might be a good thing.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:08:26
Far fewer coins will be rewarded, Bitcoin a hedge against traditional markets/money, more people will see the benefits of holding Bitcoin etc.
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:07:10
Rubbish. Not if secured properly. If it is it’s completely unseizable. That’s if people even know you have it. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:24:00
Ethereum I suppose? Mutable, unlimited supply, no real world use as yet, over-dependent on one person. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:54:30
Another smart arse I told you so post.
Those people (if there were any who said this - you don't link to any comments) probably bought 5-7 years ago.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:20:05
It took 35 months to reach the last ATH from the bear market low.
@_date: 2016-07-15 17:24:01
Lot of scepticism. If a chart shows the price going down then people are quick to fortell doom. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:01:09
100 divided by 20. You know fine well what I mean. We were talking about a possible crash from the current price. And you're just pulling figures out your ass anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:54:38


And what's wrong with that?
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:44:57


And what makes you think it will stay like that? Or tolerance of money controlled by a third party?


That's why they are suckers.


I don't believe in holding forever and never selling a Satoshi. You take some profits obviously or get back your original investment at least.
You wait for 3-5 years unless you time it during the start of a bubble.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:48:40
Might be another rally before the probable bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:31:25
Bch was at $4000 at one point. That’s not happening again. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:49:04
That's likely at this stage. /s
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:24:27
Bitcoin doesn’t have numbers to misreport. It’s completely transparent. The btc price is falling because it was way overbought and there’s also much profit taking going on. Bitcoin itself has not changed. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:58:19
The markets move on rumors not news. You need to work on your attitude. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:31:43
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:02:10
No, because he could have sold it for millions
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:13:06
No coin can nowhere near match Visa at present anyway. All of them fall short. Or will, in this respect.
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:15:06
Indeed. No one was sure Bitcoin would ever be worth anything. It was totally off the radar. A shitcoin can now go to a dollar in a few hours. Something which took Bitcoin years.
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:42:52
You clearly don't understand Bitcoin. You're storing value in Bitcoin as opposed to it being in say a bank. That's using it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:00:35
Statistically unfair. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:32:09
Tell us when to buy o wise one. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:54:58
Perfect answer for those who say we all could have sold in January and bought back in months later.
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:36:19
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:42:17
Where does it say anything about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:46:37
You’re making it look like I thought these were the only things that matter. I clarified it for you - although it shouldn’t be necessary if you’re in Bitcoin for years. You should have picked a less silly example.
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:45:39
If you had Bitcoin you wouldn't care about government collapse.
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:46:42
No one is saying you should. But the disparity between gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s is immense considering the latter’s qualities.
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:32:22
...time to buy.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:51:53
To be fair they are so rich they don’t have to work so hang around Reddit all day.  ;-)

"redditor for 2 weeks"
I'm guessing you are crypto viking.
Anyway, it could be exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:12:20
It's a currency and network. Cash is physical.
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:46:55
Cash needs the temperature not to go above fahrenheit 451 or it’s useless.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:06:43
Only just. They’re parasites.

Whilst slagging off Bitcoin on r/btc. Anyway I didn’t deny his good work didI?
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:11:38
Many were predicting 3K.
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:53:20
Bet BTC will hold its value better over the next 12 months or so.
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:45:31


There are not money. Money is not displayed unnecessarily.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:23:59
Love the way Bitcoin is casually mentioned along with gold, bonds and stocks.
@_date: 2018-12-14 01:54:04
Enough buyers to keep the price relatively stable despite it being inflationary at the moment?
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:17:29
Do it every 2 weeks or so.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:00:55
Woah dude
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:59:07
An exchange is basically a traditional bank.
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:32:29
It will.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:28:51
Someone will do it though. And be richly rewarded. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:00:50
You're here a week. What would you know?
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:39:26
Because you don't want to kiss the governmental ass?
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:52:20
A safe cannot transfer money. Anyway you were talking about the storage of money. 
Exchanges are regulated. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:06:29
Agreed. ;-)
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:12:57


Speak for yourself. Many keep their money in Bictoin because it cannot be touched by governments.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:42:15
If it's a pyramid scheme, so is art and comic collecting, etc. Calling it a pyramid scheme is basically you admitting, anyway, that the returns can be incredible. 
You're so cynical about investing in general I fear there's no much hope for you.
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:43:16
It says "King of Saudi Arabia declares bitcoin the new national currency"
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:22:12
Not a great likeness and the eyes look vacant.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:51:36
I'm not saying you're wrong, but if he made a stupid investment it's his own fault. Not FUD against Bitcoin per se.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:01:38
So Bitcoin will use satellites as is becoming the case. Good luck stopping that. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:28:08
At least the speculation encourages adoption.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:01:32
In ten years?  No they don’t. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:50:59
I didn’t say it was. I’m just saying if you have Bitcoin (or gold etc. ) you will suffer less. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:52:38
Free lunch?
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:53:39
OK, but the Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:31:03
Six months I think.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:56:19
That has no bearing on BTC's monetary policy.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:45:02
Or 1900% depending the year.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:10:36
So, you couldn't have bought more at $12?
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:20:13
Should have kept if at former. It's the network that matters.
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:43:37
If Silk Road could ship drugs...
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:56:55
So emigrate?
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:52:22
There’s no reason to it won’t repeat. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:04:30
Sam Harris HAS accepted Bitcoins. Not sure if he still does.

100k is ok if you can afford to lose it or are very patient.

So no wife, kids, mother-in-law... Wait, you're having a ball.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:04:11


@_date: 2018-12-09 19:56:46
That doesn’t prove either way. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:14:12
Not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:34:17
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:28:55
Well, you could say that about anything. The nuclear go codes or whatever. Credit card fraud is far easier than hacking a wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:09:41
Well, that have to don't they, with this shit security?
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:35:16
It was prescient was it not? 10 BTC won't make you rich yet but I can imagine a lot of these early users having a lot more than 10.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:44:13
AKA throwing your money away.
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:58:34
Not much of a prediction. 
This is a solid prediction:

If Ethereum were all it’s cracked up to be. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:53:44
Ethereum mentality of late.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:38:28
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:03:41
That would take it lower than the last bubble percentage wise.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:52:11
£2600 would have been enough. Foolish.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:44:03
And that's why you have a post karma of one.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:18:59
It went to 260. That second bubble was influenced by MyGox’s shenanigans though. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:13:57
They don't know it.
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:20:43
Any currency with such a small market cap would be volatile. Nothing to do with the design. There were weeks of rock solid stability even so. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:52:56
Neither does the current situation in that case. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:53:34


So Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme now? OK. Now you're trolling. You're also assuming I've taken no profits.
Still nothing about the 12% drop in gold price.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:32:17
If there is a fork. Is it a certainty?
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:21:43
And sold them high I hope.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:02:49
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:01:15

Hodl is static fomo.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:35:48
Really? Tell me how. There are wallets for Eth for example? More vendors accept it? It's been around longer? It was the daddy of the cryptos? The exchanges have more Eth-other alr pairs? Etc etc. No on all counts. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:35:00
Bitcoin is money. A sound money, that has had to earn its worth, not just decreed value like fiat, hence the name. I didn't say it was energy efficient. Perhaps all this will spur some onto produce solar powered mines and the like.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:33:11
Try looking where you sit. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:36:55
The price isn't just speculative though is it? A certain percentage of owners trust it more than their countries' banks.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:24:07
Hodl for 10 years.
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:59:06
That’s not what he asked. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:09:31
Don’t be silly. If it didn’t fall to zero in the last bear markets it will hardly now. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 18:01:44
Literally trillions? Talk about hyperbole. Completely undermines your point. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:28:38
No, but have visited.
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:10:31
The fed is more analogous to Bitcoin itself rather owners of coins.
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:29:09
Bullshit. If it went from $300 to $20000 in 3 years. 3K or whatever to 30K is nothing.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:19:46
But it was over 9000.
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:45:00
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:49:49
It’s not going to zero so you’re the dumbass. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:39:07
If you're thinking of selling your coins in cold storage despite still being well in profit, buy.
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:48:23
My uncle. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:58:18
It's not up a million or so per cent. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:32:12
Parodying you, smartass. And it has nothing to do with the other point.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:58:59
Surely shitcoins performed worse. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:08:43
Trader Tone Vays says about 3000. His calls have been good.

That joke doesn’t quite work. :-p
@_date: 2018-12-13 04:20:38
Did I say white collar crime was more prevalent? What are you talking about?  And I don’t think the Washington Post indulges in wild conjecture. Are you really saying white collar criminals aren’t given a relatively easier deal than petty thieves? Give me a break. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:00:55
And it doesn't owe you anything. So don't cry if you bought at a bad time. Just put up or shut up.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:22:16
If you say so. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:59:16
What unforeseen circumstances could want them to lose money? And they can't even agree on the block size.
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:46:02
That's DASH.

Something far rarer than a dollar should rise in price.
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:21:20
Lol yourself. I didn’t say that. Wouldn’t it be much better to sell now at 3700?
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:35:45
You didn't mention the Twitter founder tweeted this.
edit: typo
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:59:15
It is him.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:00:40
It could be that in a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:23:02
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:28:16
If you lose it it's your fault.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:15:33
Which report?
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:39:25
Calm the fuck down. You’re clueless about natural selection. The people in the cartoon are dead or dying. And you’re assuming they haven’t already reproduced.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:02:24
I thought the same in the bleak 2015 bear market. I was proven right. A money with a fixed supply with the miner reward halved every four years. The best way existing of sending value without a middleman. It's a no-brainer.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:07:52
Did you complain about volatility when it went up 6500%?
Traders love volatility anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:17:22
Which is why this is on the front page.
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:53:25
Bitcoin itself is not to blame for Mt Gox. And what do you mean invest in it?
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:24:39
With one bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:47:40
It was a stupid analogy anyway. Tape formats are not protocols. 
Here's a better argument - TCP/IP has stuck around despite there being better protocols. Don't assume the supposedly better protocol will prevail. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:09:13
It would still have value. Most of the value would be transferred from off shore accounts and the like. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:32:54
No one who put their savings into it, that is. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:19:55
They short it because things are bearish.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:11:03
Isn't this the first year?
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:35:52
It was just a snappy comeback. However you can emigrate (and will have no problem bringing your money with you). 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:10:05
How is it crippled? It's a lot better than it was when he introduced it.
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:57:19
He should have seen all this before. He should be more optimistic long term.
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:23:20
He could already be.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:22:51
Isn’t it bloody obvious? You tell me why it isn’t. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:50:01
Let him just save it if he wants. Saving is not a dirty word.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:01:24
Apart from the who’s behind the crypto bit he made sense.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:57:53
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:41:43
Over two years of a bull run and then people lose their shit and post stuff like this.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:44:40
And for buying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:07:45
And those things are even worth more because of it. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:46:31
Apart from 2018 so far any other year he would see profits.
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:04:03
Where's yours, genius? Look at the all time charts. Look at the finite number of coins. The deflationary nature of Bitcoin. The increasing number of users. The probable incoming financial crisis. Simple FOMO when Bitcoin goes up. Look at it recovery from a 2015 low of $166 after crashing 87% only to recover in 2016-2017, rising 6500%.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:57:17
If you've been in since 2011 you should know better.
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:22:06
Probably because for centuries the rich have been getting away with murder (literally and figuratively speaking) and the poor have been treated like shit. If that doesn't get you angry maybe you're the one with problems. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:08:19
No one said we’re in a bull market yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:51:09
We've had several 500 dollar drops this year already. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:36:56
Accused of.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:38:43
That depends on the miners. Many use renewable power according to the coinshares report. It's not intrinsic to Bitcoin. Your coins can be stored on a paper wallet which uses 0 energy. You cash, gold etc has to mined, printed and be stored in a physical building and be guarded. To be transported requires using fuel and electricity. Bitcoin can be sent online or any medium which can accept numbers. Which ultimately is more wasteful?
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:25:19
Says the guy on here 4 weeks. mikef1015's talking about in 2-5 years.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:35:59
Show me the TA or the figure us just from your aforementioned ass. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:43:39
Fools will always lose money. That's not Bitcoin's fault. Let's drop it. You have nothing to say.
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:48:36
That's not fair, you're picking the lowest points.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:42:05
It can use satellites as well. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:45:46
Cyincal af. 
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:49:04
Not accepted anywhere. And horses have been an accepted form of transport since the beginning of history...
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:53:29
Glad I sold mine many months ago.
One good thing about Bitcoin dropping is it might help to kill off these pretenders and others like Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:56:16
So use fiat for that. You should have both at the moment. We’re transitioning. Hopefully. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:48:22
All markets are manipulated.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:49:15
Show me an asset with the same returns in a similar time frame. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:02:27
You need to know when to hodl. Or not to invest so much it's a problem.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:33:51
It's easy if you got in below $100-200.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:04:27
In 5 years (one would hope) buying at 6K or or 3K or less won't matter.
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:07:25
This was posted a few days ago.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:04:54
That wasn’t adoption. That was gambling by fools.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:34:37
You should some understanding of what you are buying though.
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:37:32
The fuck is this doing here?
@_date: 2018-12-01 04:57:26
His post was neutral.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:31:07
Because he’s protecting his wealth against inflation and recession?
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:10:36
And probably sold at 16000. I doubt many held till now.
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:57:34
On the other hand there’s MtGox. Get a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:31:01
Both would be massive gains.
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:27:23
Clearly you won't. Maybe he has balls.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:29:22
It wishes.

Was it? Earlier than that I think.
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:17:52
The old ad is too vague.

No, advice.
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:54:41
Only censorship resistance matters.

Which was an amazing buying opportunity.

Betamax was better (supposedly) than VHS but VHS prevailed.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:56:39
It's not doing anything it hasn't done before. Maybe the bias is yours.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:43:07
Why is your site inaccessible at the moment? Also, shouldn't you stop admitting new members for a while?
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:42:02

What about the bcash and other airdrops? Aren't they dividends?
@_date: 2013-05-29 01:51:36
Multibit and blockchain.info.
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:03:03
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:22:09
If Bitcoin is replaced then that new coin can be replaced also. Bitcoin will either rule or they'll all perish.
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:51:11
Cash is untraceable. Bitcoin is. How do you not know that?
Edit: and by cash I mean paper money. So many on here don’t know the proper terminology apparently. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:09:29
It’s not maximalism to say something is better when it is.
And Bitcoin has smart contracts.

Supply and demand. Who said anything about charts? - which can be read anyway whether you like it or not. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:10:24
Surely this is exactly what it was designed for. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:11:07
It hasn’t capitulated yet?
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:51:44
Thought it a coincidence at first but not with the ‘09. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:18:12
With hardly any users.
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:38:21
Use a hardware wallet they said.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:10:09
Infrastructure in place now though, with wifi, 4G and phones etc. Should be faster.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:41:36
What business receives only one form of payment? It's not ready as a currency yet anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:50:49
Doesn't it have to become a store of value before it is a currency or unit of account?
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:15:32
Certainly more trolls on here. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:59:34


And Litecoin is worth less now than in December 2013 (admittedly during a bubble).
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:24:01
The problem with things like Silk Road is because they're not regulated anything could be posted to clients. I'm sure most vendors were trustworthy but what's the stop some psycho sending drugs laced with toxins?
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:30:13
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:56:26
Big enough. Taking forever to synchronize.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:49:12
But their coins mooned. Not all bad. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:06:39
You have 0 arguments or rationale. Bitcoin still up 2000 per cent since last bear market low. Suck on it.
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:18:38
Not necessarily. The current site looks a little friendlier though.
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:58:46
Yep. Glad to be wrong. Things seem to be different now. I can't see this one stopping at the moment. ...though I could be wrong. ;-)

Well, obviously is going to say it is completely anonymous.
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:03:47
The suckers bought in late because the people who really cared about it started the bubble.
Most currencies do not have a fixed supply.
What do you expect from a currency that rose 1900% the year before? Or 6500% since the last bear market low?
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:58:29
Less inflationary than gold by then I believe.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:06:26
Didn't find it funny. Maybe it has to happen to you.

The market cap is still tiny and therfore easily affected by market forces. There's nothing inherent in Bitcoin that causes the volatility.

Stop quibbling. You know it’s impossible. Every government everywhere would have to ban it. They ban drugs and that still doesn’t stop drug use. In fact they’re worth a lot more because of it. 
People would use Tor, decentralized exchanges or other methods. Bitcoin can be sent over any network not just the internet. 
Those already in Bitcoin would be untouchable.

It wouldn’t necessarily. But you have to distinguish between Bitcoin users and Bitcoin as a central bank or self-contained “government” in itself. It itself cannot be in debt.

Define intrinsic value. What intrinsic value does a dollar have?
It's the same get rich quick idiots that caused the bubble and crash. It had been rising for over two years so someone made money out of it. Newcomers could not accept the sudden price dips then started panicking and Bitcoin gets blamed for that.
If you're so clueless about the benefits of Bitcoin why are you hanging around here?

@_date: 2018-12-06 03:53:27
No I don’t. You really think the average buyer sees a ban or whatever and thinks damn I’m selling my Bitcoins? They sell because they’ve made a profit or because the price is falling and they panic or they just need the money.

The idea of the meme is to change that. Lighten up.

They are talking about selling the Bitcoins not about spending them. Selling them certainly doesn’t help Bitcoin.

Then it's all relative. The alts will fall even more. They will die. I'm not sure what your point is.
You're just guessing it will fall a lot more anyway. It's already near percentage-wise of the 2014-15 drop.
It's too much in its infancy to be a good currency. That will be the last stage.

Not at all. Otherwise it would have crashed after the Bitfinex business. Tether runs on a layer on Bitcoin. So it owes more to Bitcoin. In any case it’s not the same as the situation with fiat currencies.

All other things being equal, then, Ethereum's market cap is not as high as people think. And certainly the market caps of fiat currencies aren't as high since a lot of it is printed out of thin air.

Enough to replace Bitcoin in any way. Or to deserve high valuations. Ethereum was pre-mined and is too centralized due to Buterin’s influence. Monero really just has privacy going for it.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:44:06
No, it isn't wasteful. The miner spends money on energy (a real world thing) which creates the coins and secures the network. Therefore it has real world backing.
If you mean it's not green enough, 70% of miners use renewable energy. Where's the uproar over Christmas lights etc anyway?

Then so is gold in that case and none of it has any value.
Bitcoin is not produced out of thin air. Money and energy has to be devoted to mining it (so much so that people make such a fuss over it). And the supply is mathematically fixed. This is not the case with fiat money.

The monetary policy is.

Okay, but that was their problem. They should have researched especially past bubbles and crashes.
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:29:44
They were supposed to have a key to a Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:20:12
You suggest they use magic? And why is only Bitcoin held to account for “wasting “ electricity?

@_date: 2013-03-31 13:23:57
Go for it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:10:35
This post is a load of balls. There are a number of Bitcoin apps on the App store. Just shows people are content not to check facts. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:04:30
There were no accounts, so anyone could access your BTCs if they knew the URL. It was like Mailinator to blockchain.info's Gmail. Convenient but not safe for storing big amounts.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:04:03
This is not inherent to Bitcoin. Just greed on the part of Exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:42:56
Cool. Some hate the rising price but I like how the 10 dollars pocket money I put on my phone a month ago is now worth 60 dollars. I think I'd be more inclined to spend that.

The $ sign is used by lot of countries and no one gets confused or bored. The Ƀ sign doesn't read well at small font sizes.

It's not an analogy it's a comparison.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:59:10
Yes, it is a bit like a big Kickstarter project.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:16:05
Now that people have seen how high it can go you can be sure people will buy shitloads if it plummets in price.
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:03:43

@_date: 2019-05-26 20:23:33
2017 you mean. And that ultimately started from $200 in 2015.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:02:31
Very nice.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:14:06
Doesn't like? Why? Al Gore is a fan of Bitcoin and on the Apple board of directors. There is a fully-functioning wallet - Blockchain, not to mention other payment apps such as PayPal. My guess is Coinbase just fucked up with the TOS.

Not everyone is into porn you know, however, uh, friendly that might be.

Doubtful to say the least that they would devise such a thing. If Bitcoin becomes more acceptable, however, Apple could lend their expertise in making the user interfaces more user friendly.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:01:13
Whereas you want cheap bitcoins. Stop manipulating us.
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:52:15
No, because of his general behaviour here.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:27:55
Can mining really continue until 2140? Surely Bitcoin will have been supplanted by something better by then and may even look antiquated?
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:23:05
Too soon.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:15:01
Two weeks ago? Check a chart. And then it could have gone to 2K? Who knew?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:22:17
No, but I'm in the former only for the money.
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:00:29
Well, people will get their Intsawallet money back. Most of them anyway.

I'll bet you won't panic-sell it if the price of gold drops.

If you have the passphrase you should have no problem. It’s just basically a text file. The private key is inside.

Still seems like a lot of trouble and time-consuming.

I still don't understand how it works.

We heard that at 900. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:41:41
I don't buy that. They could've prefaced it by saying they're playing devil's advocate. Someone who's been on here while would have raised more original points anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:39:08
It hasn't even dropped.

Of course anything could happen.

They are an investment product also, and there's no harm in using them so.

I dunno. "Plan B" suggests it's something that wasn't good enough to try first.
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:08:04
It's not priced in. But there's no question some are buying with an eye on it.

Piss off.

This happened even in 2017. Several times.

And she sucks - like this joke.

Or it could be above 3000. You can never be quiet sure. Just remember though it did hit the ATH less than a week ago. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:15:34
*eyes glaze over*
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:04:59

So you're saying Bitcoin is more decentralised?
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:02:55
OK, they facilitated the selling of drugs etc. I'm not sure where you're going with this. The first poster in this thread defended his supposed dark side. I merely posited that there was some morally questionable goods on his site.

What are you basing it on going to zero tomorrow - or any time? Some imaginary major flaw which has yet to be found yet? Or a country banning bitcoin? (Something they'd find impossible to enforce.)

I like to think of it more as half a thousand.

If it was done simply because Bitcoins were illegal? There'd be an uproar. In any case they would need to know you have them and be able to find them.

That's what the BBC scornfully said, as if it was BTC's doing. The FT are responsible for that cheesy graphic.

Ask for their thoughts on branding. The names of many of the startups (some of which they run) sound the same. Shouldn't they be more imaginative coining names (no pun intended) for these companies to give them more unique identities.

You can still sell the bitcoins at that price and buy back more if the price goes down. So it's not quite fake.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:17:46
Because you know it's lost value. Or been seized.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:16:32
Worry? He may be hoping it does so he can buy. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:46:24
Lightning and Segwit are the solution. There won't be another bubble for a while anyway.
Besides which it's not just a currency, it's the only serious way of storing and sending value without a middleman. No bank or credit card can do that.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:09:30
That's not an argument, who might have said what. 5000 was still far above than it was around the halving. Everyone might as well shut up shop if it goes to 500.

@_date: 2013-11-20 11:26:05
We heard that in April.
@_date: 2013-11-02 04:53:41
Agreed. I suggested this in another post. This and "bitcoin" would be enough.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:09:50
"UK Bank deposits are currently disabled" it says. I hope it is temporary.

2013 or 2017?
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:10:44
There are other charts.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:56:02
Bitcoin is doing what it's supposed and has to do. The market cap is too tiny for serious use. It has to rise and thus bitcoins will have to become more valuable.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:29:41
Mostly balderdash, I thought.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:43:36
Not for long perhaps.
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:22:10

It wouldn't be true parity as there are far more ounces of gold than there are bitcoins. BTC would have be worth a hell of a lot more.

@_date: 2013-11-17 16:55:48
You say first that it's overvalued then that it lacks stability. It can only become stable by becoming more valuable.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:54:35
If it succeeds, yes. One bitcoin could be worth $100,000+.
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:27:13
$100 might be chicken feed in 6 months. Still not too late.
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:06:59

What if teh interweb suffers a power outage? Does it disappear forever?
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:51:39
Looks kind of geeky and abstruse. Perhaps a Satoshi could be a bitcoin and we start from there, so the current "bitcoin" would be written as 100,000,000 bitcoins (or whatever it is). And leave out this millibit, centibit nonsense.
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:37:40
It could be a string of unrandom letters or words if you have a brain wallet. But I guess that ultimately is a key to a key of random numbers and letters.

Don't care for it, sorry. At least I can change it back.

Use the Blockchain info app or jailbreak it.

It's rare now. Maybe always will be.

Don't get so emotive. Keep this fanboy-calling crap out of here.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:52:19
You bought at 1200 or something? Relax. It'll go back up.
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:53:14
Or keep it simple and just use the Bitcoin and the Satoshi.
e.g.  *10 Satoshis, 1,000 Satoshis, 100,000 Satoshis.*
Perhaps using the dollar sign: *$10, $1,000, $100,000 etc.*
The dollar's going that way anyway.
@_date: 2013-06-21 10:40:34
Where are you getting these figures? Also, Apple haven't been hostile to Bitcoin - the wallets were against their general restrictions.

That's an insult to chimpanzees.

The quality of the sub has gone down however.
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:30:55
It needs to offer something other means of payment don't. The ability to pay very tiny amounts with almost zero fees is a big plus. Someone suggested once, for example, it could be used by motorists to pay other motorists wirelessly for their place in traffic. Or something like that.
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:16:53
Would set a very bad precedent.

I'm sure he could handle the death threats.

Great. They accept Bitcoi- ...oh.
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:15:09
Not crazy about it either but I can't imagine grandmothers using millibits and centibits and remembering which numbers they pertain to. Perhaps just "bits" could be used for any denomination below a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:37:23
No. It happens.

It was Samuel Clemens who said it. :-P
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:47:14
It was for a DDoS protection service which probably a handful of people paid for in BTC. Not worth crashing 400 dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:49:40
Until Gox is DDOS-ed again.
@_date: 2013-12-23 12:28:07
Because you didn't search?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:11:26
Meh. Like the Chinese were buying up bitcoins to pay for some DDoS protection service on Baidu.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:12:30


Nah. Not your mouth.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:04:37
Or come out of the closet.

I meant no, not too late. But you got the drift.
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:46:48
Drop the "The".
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:30:06
I think it is far-fetched. You know there are a few decent people working in LE believe it or not.
As for making drug-selling safe - that is still not going to go down well with the most people. There's far too much stigma just in using drugs never mind selling them - even for stuff like cannabis. Being a "drug-pusher" is almost the lowest of the low for some. I'm not saying that's my view.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:41:27
Very good. Now learn how to use the shift key, simpleton.

Mentioned he was going to make a phone call. Probably asking his friend to buy a few dozen bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:28:27
I was referring chiefly to supposed tweets that were deleted.
Oh and yeah a DDoS protection service from Baidu that only a handful of people paid for in BTC was reason enough to crash Bitcoin 40%. Give me a fucking break. The cynicism on this sub is a joke.
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:14:05
Moronic comments abound on that page.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:34:02
These guys need some decent PR. At least they could've worn a couple of suits and met the reporters in a cafe.

So it's not through a supposed fear of not getting a cut. But tell that lot in here. Probably Coinbase broke some TOS.

I dunno. I remember asking someone to help me set a hotmail account in '98. Hard for me to believe now.

The one with the least downvotes, judging by what I see so far. (Not saying this comment passes muster).
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:25:02
Over the long run Bitcoin has clearly an upward trend. There's no point despairing every time there's a crash.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:53:46
It probably wouldn't be practicable at the moment.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:28:55
Do you really think the average person in China knows about Bitcoin? Those buying are probably educated and with reasonable incomes.
 What's more, I heard nothing about any suicide attempts after the last crash.
Nobody here is forcing them to buy anyway. We've nothing to feel guilty about.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:03:13
To paraphrase Steve Martin "Used emoticon to buy karma."
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:10:02

@_date: 2013-10-25 19:28:30
You watch too many movies.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:29:20
And most attempts to show Bitcoin in a good light are tiresomely dismissed as circeljerking or delusional. Cynical cunts half of them.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:33:37
This was probably sparked by traders selling off some to make short term gains and then buying back in cheaper.
Edit: PotatoBadger no doubt explained it better.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:01:15
And there are a lot of nerds on Reddit (hardly surprising) judging by the downvotes.
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:52:27

@_date: 2017-06-16 21:00:50
Agree with the no leader part but not the greed part. Greed helps to drive Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:46:26
Aye. So many look at one Bitcoin thinking it must be a small unit. They don't seem to understand how scarce Bitcoins are. There are only 12 million, there will only ever be 21 million.
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:20:27
It's thrilling.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:31:49
I'm tired of people coming on here asking it's too late to buy - I'll bet these are chiefly the ones doing the panic selling.

You just have to worry about your account being frozen.

1. Bitcoins have to rise to increase its market cap. No one can buy anything for 12 billion dollars in bitcoins.
2. Hoarders will spend more freely when they feel they're bitcoins have appreciated enough in value.

Perhaps "bit" could be used for anything smaller than a bitcoin. "ƀ" as, you suggested, could the symbol for the bit.

**Bitcoin Price Hits New Record High**
Bitcoin's price vaulted above $400 on the Mt. Gox exchange on Wednesday, touching a record as the virtual currency continues to be buoyed by growth in China, limited supply and new investment products driving demand.
Bitcoin is a four-year-old virtual currency that isn't backed by a central bank and can be traded on a number of exchanges or swapped privately. A growing number of merchants also accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services, because the transaction costs associated with the currency are generally cheaper than those with credit cards or debit cards.
Bitcoin's price has been extremely volatile. The virtual currency started the year trading at $13.55. In April, it touched a then-record high of about $265 as interest in the currency continued to build. But in early October it fell back to about $90 in the wake of the bust of an online drug-trafficking website that used the currency. On Wednesday morning, it was recently trading at a high of $419.99.
There are a number of factors driving the virtual currency, according to Nicholas Colas, a market strategist at New York based global brokerage company ConvergEx Group.
He says Bitcoin's price is continuing to benefit from a bitcoin investment trust started in September by Second Market, the New York-based business known for trading pre-IPO company stock. Mr. Colas notes the trust has been "very popular."
The trust invests solely in the digital currency, and according to Mr. Colas is beginning to help lend bitcoin credibility among more traditional investors.
Another factor driving bitcoin's price higher is more interest from China, says Mr. Colas, who notes the biggest bitcoin exchange is now in China. The currency continues to see a boost from Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc., BIDU +1.02% which started accepting bitcoin as a payment method for its online security and firewall services in mid-October.
In a note to clients earlier this month, Mr. Colas also highlighted bitcoin's limited supply as further driving interest in the virtual currency. "Why is bitcoin seemingly minted on Teflon?" he wrote. "There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins, and there are only 12.0 million currently."

They might hold, one hopes, knowing now it won't go to zero if it crashes or even below 50-60.
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:47:50
Just because no one invites you...
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:52:56
Rather an oversight though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:38:00
High of $118 today. Could be two weeks or less.

Maybe I didn't make myself clear. I didn't mean to say the encryption had been broken. But if an owner writes down his password somewhere or uses a dodgy brainawallet passphrase or someone installs a keylogger on his PC the laws of the universe are not going to help much.

Around $1,000,000 according some peoples' calculations.

So how do you know what the valuation is? You don't. No one does.
For Bitcoin to succeed the market cap has to grow so it can be used by an owner to buy Pizza Hut if need be and not just pizzas. Therefore a bitcoin will need to be worth thousands or millions so overvalued now simply means not as cheap to buy as it was in July.
Edit: added bit at the end.

It's still as high as it was a few days ago. Who cares.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:40:17
Fair enough. It'll be nice to buy coffee in Starbucks with it but I think BTC has bigger fish to fry, can do so much more.

For those who think bitcoins are overpriced now, even then they thought they could rise substantially. In the next message:

the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.

I'm not crazy about these weird names. Just my two Ringos worth.
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:24:27
Self-righteous user name too.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:02:00
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:06:56
Well, that's why users try to jailbreak stuff - to circumvent restrictions. Apple are hardly going to make it easy to do, are they?
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:50:56
How can anything of any great value (i.e. in the billions) be purchased with it if the market cap is too small? It has to go up in value.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:50:43
Not if someone decides to sell a few million dollars worth of bitcoin and some start panicking when it drops. It happened at 900. Anyway don't take my above post as trading advice. It could keep going up after 1000.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:20:07
You should've held onto them for a year or two. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:29:46
Just jailbreak it. No need to be a drama queen.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:13:42
Sub's going to the dogs.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:58:20
Even a bottle of water is seen as a threat.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:19:03
What are you 14?
@_date: 2013-06-05 00:09:11
Just need to add a DNS no. into your network settings. Not that hard.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:25:14
Paypal, however, own ebay, which has tried to clamp down on the sale of bitcoins on that site.
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:51:20
£100 worth I bought a month ago is now £179.6. Nice.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:04:09
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:29:29
There are plenty. Well-known Bitcoin figures are much more bullish on BTC's future price than the average Redditor. On here you're considered a circle jerker if you think BTC can reach even 100,000.
@_date: 2013-05-28 10:11:35
Use the blockchain.info site. It's more noob-friendly.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:18:14
A real crash usually takes a while to recover from though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:07:59
He still can. And 100 is very unlikely.
@_date: 2013-05-30 22:30:56
He was probably being conservative if anything.
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:11:49
If it's grandmothers talking about it, ok...
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:32:20
Max pumping and dumping.

I must burn more money on Bitcoin-24 later.
@_date: 2013-06-29 21:53:33
He'll have a moustache next.
@_date: 2013-05-14 10:04:52
Rather daunting for new or non users.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:11:23
So could the dollar.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:10:21
Reality4u is 10.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:13:19
Lot of beginners here today. Over 1000 readers. I wonder if that Reddit front page story has had an effect.
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:02:06
These two may be the main factors for the current rise. Sure, the Chinese are getting into it but I don't think some Baidu service accepting XBT would make much difference.
@_date: 2013-10-24 09:44:29
MoonGuy can do no wrong apparently.
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:41:02
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:35:46
I see Guinea is there so we're not the only coinage. ;-) Will BTC's market be worth all these put together some day or just say China's? 
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:31:38
It didn't secure DPR's coins.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:21:48
Free as in "free".
@_date: 2013-10-26 00:16:48
That's fair enough, if you can track them.
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:05:29
No, but it was nominally for a long time.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:16:33
Soon pass the 100 mark.
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:08:59
Takes one to know one. Since the SR price is pegged to the dollar it doesn't matter if the value rises.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:27:43
It's going to be confusing to most people. Perhaps the denominations and where the decimal point sits need to be looked at again. The Satoshi could be the equivalent of cents, 0.000001 could be the new Bitcoin and anything higher is tens and hundreds etc of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:21:07
Where is it exactly?
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:40:56
It's 206.7 equivalent on BtcChina.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:59:40
I'm not sure these negative ads are a good idea. Explaining what Bitcoin is to Joe Bloggs might be a better idea.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:19:58
So Paypal is tolerated because they're a big company? I'm not buying that.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:04:01
Are you begging?
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:51:31
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:39:27
Like the droll Reddit comment despite the downvotes.
@_date: 2013-06-20 23:23:03
Only now?
@_date: 2013-10-19 22:49:19

@_date: 2013-11-29 18:46:27
mBTC is just so geeky.
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:27:00
No, they just don't understand it.

Cool. I have some skeptical Brazilian friends. I need to show them this. Para a lua!

I bought 10 for $180 in April before the crash. Glad I held.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:42:01
Over the long run and barring a calamity, yes.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:28:18
Back to the Future reference, I think.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:39:15
Just hold.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:09:29
No, not too late. It depends how much you want to invest and can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-06-01 00:43:12
Seem like a decent bunch.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:37:03
Tells it like it is. Baidu "debacle" big fuss over nothing.
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:56:04
Thanks! Maybe doesn't fit in with the perverse anti-Apple ethos here on Reddit.
@_date: 2013-10-20 19:33:53
Does it send 5000 volts of electricity to your groin area?

Not go haywire again.

Nah, you're just addicted like all of us, ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:51:50
Try Bitstamp. Easier to get verified using them. Utility bill not needed.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:39:35
Didn't crash that low.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:12:22
"Articulative"? ;-) You're right though, should've been upvoted more.
@_date: 2013-06-01 15:44:29
Fair enough.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:22:40
witcoins' trolling is misinterpreted as humour judging by the upvotes.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:46:03
The price between them (as units) has never been greater.
@_date: 2013-06-14 23:15:37
Enjoyed this talk but a lot of the questions were pretty dumb.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:17:11
There is no such thing as an accurate price.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:36:11
Bitcoin will never go to zero because I'll buy them all up at $1. ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:28:35
He even looks like a dork.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:08:58
On Bitstamp.
edit: downvoted for stating a fact.
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:47:19
I'm in Ireland also and use Bitstamp. Try that if you want. Getting verified easier too.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:29:14
They had plenty of warnings on here that it could be a bubble, not to invest more than can lose, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:14:48
Whilst ignoring the fully functional Blockchain app in their store. Right.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:11:31
So you condone panic-selling?
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:46:32
IRL? Couldn't you just say you met him?
@_date: 2013-11-13 10:23:55
We get this question several times a day.
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:26:25
Yes, but we haven't seen it rising like this daily since those heady days in April.
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:52:20
Can't you just say "I think".
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:55:50


It looks more like HAL 9000.
@_date: 2013-06-09 11:24:00
That's supposed to be much much higher than it is now.
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:12:38
Did it ages ago.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:09:16
All these denominations will get confusing for the average user. Perhaps a Satoshi could be a cent, 0.0000001 or whatever's next could be a bitcoin unit and anything higher is 10s or 100s etc. of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-23 23:30:17
It'll practically be all mined by 2040.
@_date: 2013-04-06 10:34:58
That safe looks pretty safe.
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:09:49
Wouldn't it make mores sense to buy from other exchanges (cheaper) and sell at Mt Gox?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:07:14
It  doesn't usually go below the previous bubble's ATH.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:02:53
And that they won't shut it down. Not they could anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:50:32
He completely skirted the BTC remittance factor in China.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:53:00
OK. Go for it - if you can afford to lose it. Not likely you will but the obligatory caveat emptor on here. It's gone up 3000% this year already. If it's even a fraction of that next two years you should get a nice return. Barring a disaster.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:50:50
That'll teach the panickers for selling.
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:35:38
Can someone do a TL;DR/ELI5 summary of the filing?
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:07:39
Bitstamp accept bank statements.
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:01:17
A rittle.
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:46:16
I tried with TOR Browser. "How do i buy bitcoins" came up 3rd.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:10:33
Or you could have just downloaded the Blockchain app. Bored of these anti-Apple posts.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:23:22
Not really a surprise considering it's the Guardian.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:54:44
Those who bought at ten cents are probably asking those who bought at $50 the same question.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:09:36
And 46% of Americans think the world is 6000 years old.
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:14:45

@_date: 2013-11-01 00:42:49
Unlike most Bitcoin sub-reddits (often superfluous) this one is a good idea.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:35:55
Could use this:
Bit extreme perhaps.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:42:34
Perhaps, but they need to know about it and have some money to throw around. I don't think these sweatshop workers you mentioned would fit the profile.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:47:09
Working now.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:41:48
It can use Bitstamp.

@_date: 2013-11-03 18:53:04
Reality4u has another new account I see.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:09:09
Buying at 100 is a no-brainer.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:22:39
And you're not biased because you have neither? It was a valid rebuttal.
Edit: Ah, I see. You were being ironic.
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:24:22
People who can search instead of posting stuff like "should I buy Bitcoins?" over and over again.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:28:25
You'll have to prove how much you had.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:58:31
Now who's being defensive?
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:01:52
I doubt they were acquiring it to buy things with anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:53:48
@_date: 2013-06-01 21:58:28
Is this a commission?
@_date: 2013-10-23 05:45:12
Why would they allow it in the first place if that was their stance?
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:17:20
I'm saying don't go crazy and put your life savings into it. Or if you do make sure you're in it for the long term.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:11:28
"Mt. Gox is happy to announce that global account withdrawals have now fully resumed as of today"
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:48:21
Or maybe he will. ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:31:16
This does not look in any way staged.
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:13:50


That was a few weeks in Bitcoins nascent history, not over a hundred years.
@_date: 2013-08-14 15:13:24
@_date: 2013-10-29 11:05:32
With some reason admittedly.
@_date: 2013-10-09 12:53:38
Even if true, point still stands.
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:45:06
Are you new? Or you didn't have the balls to use your usual account?
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:10:09
I can't understand why people do this. Surely you can just buy more if it goes down and wait for it rise again.
@_date: 2013-10-20 12:26:41
Understandable confusion.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:15:05
The honey badger doesn't give a fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:29:27
Perhaps you could buy 500 now and then another 500 if it drops. But it's your call.

[It's a repost.](
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:01:54
That's one small step for a bitcoin, one giant leap for a litecoin...
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:28:19
That's more like it.
It was your manner in the other posts. Not so much what you were saying.
There's no need to get so emotional over some pieces of hardware.
A boycott of Apple's products will have very little effect and not everyone can afford to switch even if they wanted to.
Every other company's caution regarding bitcoin is given the benefit of the doubt on here - except Apple.
"Oh, let's get x-company to accept bitcoin".
When it's Apple-related it's: "Let's boycott Apple".
I see few calling for boycotts of Paypal, Amazon or can-do-no-wrong Google for not accepting bitcoin.
In any case, it's not as if there's a blanket ban on bitcoin apps on Apple's store. There's a wallet and numerous tickers and other apps.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:58:35
If it's only going be a store of value all the more to reason to hold.
@_date: 2013-06-10 21:45:42
They state that Bitcoins can get stolen. No shit? So can anything.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:12:00
Just a sell off and some noobs panicking.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:28:19
In what way, may I ask?
@_date: 2013-11-05 11:30:34
Mt Gox quoted here, so $245.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:04:11
Yeah, like the way they gave their latest operating system away for free.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:17:48
Makes no sense. Several terrorists could bring a small amount each and combine them anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:23:58
A bit like Litecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:17:04
I think it's a great store of value - if you're not judging it how it performs over a few hours or days.
@_date: 2013-10-18 01:00:28
Funny how the miner is a dwarf.
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:34:57
We're crashing upwards.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:17:31
Sorry, Albert. You tried. The miserable lot on here still can't get over some little-used service in China no longer accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-07 23:39:42
You've been here 2 days.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:46:25
Or we could use another exchange that doesn't insist on verification.
@_date: 2013-10-21 01:00:17
China waking up now (literally). We should see some more action.
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:25:53
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:15:45
Add to that list. They're probably all the same person.
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:51:23
Where can I get the Litecoin one. Thanks?
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:13:42
Must be a few forumers on here. Twice as many users than normal.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:55:34
You're a brand new Reddit user. There's a surprise.
@_date: 2013-07-18 00:27:29
Postal services have been around as long, but I'll stick with email.
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:10:37
Funny reading through the reactions to bitcointipping on there.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:10:22
Nice. Alien still looks cute too.
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:19:42
It's a strange love.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:03:38
Here we go again. zzzzzzzzzz
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:27:42
Could a long way to go yet.
@_date: 2013-06-22 21:14:49
The world ends... or moves on.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:22:07
Fuck off.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:26:32
There are other exchanges than mtgox.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:16:43
Upvoted 800 times? Who says bad news is never upvoted?
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:31:23
Thanks. We'd never have known.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:37:57
"But in early October it fell back to about $90 in the wake of the bust of an online drug-trafficking website that used the currency." That's not right, is it?
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:55:08
Yes, I received such an email a few times.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:30:39
You could buy a little now and if it drops buy more.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:30:17
Nice app this.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:04:15
Went back up to 160.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:05:04
There must be chart showing the correlation between the BTC price and rise of memes on @_date: 2013-04-10 20:21:19
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:12:41
That Eeglecomo guy in the comments is always begging for bitcoins. Seen him on Forbes' site too.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:20:33
I think there could be a daily thread here like on where people can discuss this type of thing, i.e. the current price. The title would include the date.
Wouldn't have to be about trading necessarily, but anything financially-related.
Folks can then stick their "zomg 300!!111!" posts there.
It would tidy up this sub a bit.
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:15:51
Litecoin? WTF is that? ;-)
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:15:52
Confirmation bias.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:51:17
It's not anonymous enough.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:51:19
Buy more.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:15:54
@_date: 2013-06-25 17:37:31
It'll never catch on.
@_date: 2013-06-01 13:34:31
I don't really like it either. Why do we have be against the dollar for Bitcoin to succeed? Also "Plan B" has negative connotations (not good enough to try first time).
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:05:40
China did so already.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:19:21
Very nice idea, but execution could be better.

I bought 10 at $180 last April before the big crash and have held onto them since. Need to play it cool. Nothing wrong with selling, just don't panic sell.

No way it'll go down to 10. Something catastrophic would have to happen.

Yes. Or there'll be a crash/correction.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:48:41
Especially when the price was so high. Confidence should have been high too.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:27:52
Aye. That was a crash. It didn't recover from that for months. Back up to 789 on Gox as I write.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:57:44
Yeah, whatever. You don't seem to have much belief in it. What are doing in this sub?

If Bitcoin is so mighty why should it worry about China?

The government can take our Bitcoins? I don't think so. If they think they can take our assets with impunity all the more reason to get away from assets that are seizable - e.g. traditional bank accounts.

You need to stop thinking of a Bitcoin as one small unit. There will only be 21 million of them. The market cap has to grow to be of any serious use. Try to think of it as 100,000,000 satoshis. $700 is still dirt cheap.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:20:04
Jailbreaking was made legal in the states recently.
You seem to think users own the software they install. They don't. They only own a licence to use the software.

It's not ready to be used as a currency anyway.
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:27:50
You saying it so doesn't make it ethical.


...and in Zyklon B by the Nazis.
It's not ethical to sell weapons, poisons and highly addictive drugs to unknown persons of questionable mental state. If it's to be legal (which I'm not against) it has to regulated. You can argue better than that.
And a kitchen knife can and is used for other things, these aren't on the whole.

It's not merely speculation that's pushing the price up, Bitcoin's  adoption and thus its market cap is growing, as it has to if it's to be used for serious purposes. How can someone buy something for $6 billion if there isn't even that much in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:30:32
Yes, it's by invitation only now for some reason.

The market cap has to rise at some point for it to be of any serious use. Yes, the problem is that it is too much of a cult - but in the sense of it having too few users.

We hear a lot about lost coins increasing the value of everyone else's. Obviously the owner knows, but how and when can everyone else be sure these coins have been lost therefore leading to a supposed increase in value?

The higher it goes the faster it will rise. It might be rising hundreds of dollars a day at some point in the future.

I just said it wasn't working. Where else can I get it?

So it's a great investment then. I thought you said it was going to crash? You're talking through your hole.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:22:25
I think most would prefer to receive the bitcoins.

On the contrary, it could be how they got to his coins.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:20:45
Not convinced. There are other payment apps on the store also - including a fully functional Blockchain app. 
Bitcoin's tiny user base wouldn't cause a dent in Apple's sales. And in any case you can jailbreak your device.
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:09:36
No one knows what's going to happen it could go to 300 and crash or vice versa or both.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:18:56
Not as bad as many expected though. A few thought we'd hit below 200.

It's OK for the name of a company. I wish Bitcoin companies would learn from it and use similarly memorable names instead of confusingly prefixing everything with Bit- and Coin-.
