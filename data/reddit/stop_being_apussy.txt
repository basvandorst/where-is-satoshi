yeah I thought that but I wanna give it to her this weekend and I don't think I could get one in time
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:48:13
Haha goddamn, that's a lot of articles with people talking out of their ass

This makes sense and seems correct. That is definitely the purpose of the Etherium network. I was thinking more along the lines that he meant the currency itself, and that the Ether coin is better for buying a house than Bitcoin.

Don't know about Philippines but in USA absolutely yes
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:56:57
Can I ask why you say this? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:51:07
Haha that was a well placed Michael Scott quote
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:08:06
yes...here is the original thread: 
his post is bottom of thread

here is the original thread (his comment is bottom of thread): 
it was a discussion about transaction speed, and Satoshi referenced a former thread regarding how a vending machine might work

With coinbase you do not control the private keys for your Bitcoin. Any withdraws and transfers are done by making a request to Coinbase. If for some reason they are compromised your Bitcoin could be lost to you.
With your own wallet, like Mycelium or Electrum for example, you control your private key and have full control over your Bitcoin no matter what. (Just never lose or share your private key)

haha yeah it really has nothing to do with the above picture quote at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:49:10
yeah definitely
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:27:13
Why would ETH be better for that type of purchase? I'm just curious, not saying right or wrong
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:52:21
Thanks that's a good idea
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:51:56
Yeah I figured this was best way, thanks
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:52:40
That's pretty cool...it's out of stock and the birthday is tomorrow, but I'll keep this in mind for future Bitcoin gifts. Thanks

If you end up writing the letter would you mind posting a template of it here? It could be something others end up using to get businesses in their area interested in Bitcoin.

There are lots of different wallets out there where you would own your private key so you would have complete access over your BTC. The one that I've decided on is going to be Electrum. It's very popular and gets a lot of great reviews. You can check out others too like mycelium. I purchased a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S) but it does not come in until September so I will need to store my coins elsewhere until then.

Yeah I think I got that email, but I still wanted to move them off just to have them secured in a wallet where I own the private key. I was just worried if what is going on now would affect that move.
