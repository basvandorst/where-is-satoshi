Sorry I ment what merchant or plugin you used but seen you answered another comment. 
Love your site and glad to see a site promoting and using it properly and not accepting through a merchant like shopify who just process fiat and mask it as a crypto.
P.s. I think it would be really awesome to have everything priced in btc, just like we all will be doing in a few years �� great work

What method do you use for accepting payments, and do you keep the funds as crypto or have it converted.

This title pissed me off so much.

Yea I agree, take this stupid chart down.
Not just where it starts, but everything else is wrong and misleading.
Fucking laughable!

We shouldn’t really be supporting payment processors that intervene in the vendor getting the bitcoin or alt. instead they take the bitcoin payment, sell it for fiat and give to the vendor after the nice fee is taken.

The very reason I despise vendors that uses the likes of shopify to sell. it’s not sending bitcoin, it’s converting to fiat. Most vendors know this and don’t care as they are just accepting bitcoin for the novelty.

Suppose that’s the point of off chain transactions when the main layer is congested. No messing with exchange rates or waiting for sell orders to be completed. 
But it’s great that we are free to use an alternative to an alternative.
