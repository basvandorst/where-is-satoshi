I read this and just hope the general population aren't dumb enough to take this dribble seriously. The author even went as far to say that Bitcoin is limited to $21 million. Doesn't even understand the basics.

I think the draw is that they are swapable outside of an exchange.

I'm trying to leave but I can't even get my coins out. Just sits stuck on the sending screen. Can't do it anymore and I'll consider myself lucky if I even get them out.

My dad just told me he sold. A lot of people are fearful and tons of brokers are advising people too lazy to do their own research to sell. He's going to listen to his broker over his son.

That's true, and I don't blame him. There is a huge amount of information to research. Reading my comment now I kinda seem like an ass. But I do think after all the Thanksgiving conversations that a lot of this going to occur.

It seems to me that it's almost certain it will be implemented at some point. Hopefully 2018. And yeah, litecoin will definitely get some major exposure with news like that dropping.

When a fork occurs, is the price of the new coin reflective of bitcoins price at the time of the fork? I've never experienced a fork before and can't seem to find any solid info regarding them.

The coordinated attacks on Bitcoin are obvious to me and I'm only a month into crypto. Unbelievable. Who would support BCASH when the spokesman behaves in such a way?

Cool, thanks for the explanation.

You are saying exchanges should not be regulated and held to certain standards?
