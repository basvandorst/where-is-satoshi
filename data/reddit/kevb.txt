Dear "redditor for 2 years". Your account was created years after the invention of Bitcoin. Stop spreading misinformation, you don't know what you're talking about.

I defer to my trainer when I'm in the gym. I pay him to do that and it's consensual. He is the expert on exercise but I am the expert on me, on what is in my best interests. He no more has the right to force me to work out than you have the right to force me to pay for wars overseas.


Then they should provide value and people will pay them. I'm guessing you work in the public sector...


Yeah, I do. We follow moral principles such as not taking things from people by force and go from there. Also, use better arguments... slavery was imperfect but practical and very much worth abandoning.

Or if you're a libertarian and against fiat, no?
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:41:29
But, forgive me if I'm mistaken, the overarching principle of liberal democratic government is that every person is participating equally in the decision making process?
How many government agencies or schemes do you think would receive near **zero** funding if people were free to choose or choose not to fund them?
In my book, that's a true vote.

Awesome work guys, it's really exciting to see this happening in the Phlippines :)
Do you ever mingle with the other (not necessarily BTC) startups in Manila? Have you met Mark and the Tagcoin guys? Might be some interesting discussions there.
It's inspiring to see what you're doing, I'd love to be working on making Bitcoin a reality for everyone. I'm not a VC, just a developer and entrepreneurial expat in Manila. If you're ever looking for extra pair of hands to get involved I'd love to talk :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 14:01:08
Yeah, I posted on there. It was my first time on the forum and yes, same as you, I noticed the sheer amount of posts about cheats and scams!

Yes, it is discrimination. Women discriminate between Bitcoin and other ways to spend their time and money... and choose other things.

When business want to be evil, they use the government.
They'd pay lobbyists to petition for legislation to ban or otherwise impede Bitcoin.

Look around you. Maybe everything's cool where you are, but assuming you're in the US your government is waging wars overseas where real people are dying. People are rotting in prison cells or learning to become real criminals after being locked up for possessing substances that harm, at most, themselves. The NSA is spying on everyone's phone calls, police are becoming militarised, shooting the wrong people, dogs and throwing flashbang grenades into babies cots.
Some people look at Bitcoin and see a way to finally get control of the money supply away from the psychopaths that manipulate it to pay for this insanity. More than an interesting technology or a great investment or a way to improve the way we buy shit. Some people look at it and say "huh, if we all used this the government wouldn't be able to inflate the currency to fund this shit and they wouldn't be able to borrow. This has the potential to end wars and reign in the out of control military, police and spy agencies. This has the potential to bring **real** accountability." For some of us, Bitcoin is nothing less than revolution.
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:28:22
Wow, interesting. So it's kinda like the free market where you can choose where you spend your money. Except you have to choose from a few pre-approved recipients. Whether you agree with them or not. Whether you can afford to or want to or not... Even if you're completely opposed to all of them. Even though they're a monopoly lacking any economic incentive to deliver what they promise. And except that if you don't pay, eventually some armed guys in costumes are gonna come looking for you.
Basically what we have now but with a lot more illusion of choice.

"Let's get serious" isn't an argument, my friend. You don't get to just side-step people's considered arguments with a trick...
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:02:29
The fact I don't see liberals addressing is: if you let people freely choose whether or not to pay for government, at all, in part or in full, most people will choose not to. There'd be some money, of course. But if there was no fiat inflation, no debt and 100% voluntary taxes, 90% of government would go unfunded and disband.
Isn't this the true will of the people? Voting with their feet and with their money?
@_date: 2014-06-26 07:57:33
Right, it's the only viable non-fiat currency. So politics enters into it if you're against fiat.
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:17:47


Sounds like "we'll eventually point guns at you if you don't pay us" to me...
@_date: 2014-06-27 03:22:55
Yep, Bitcoin has the potential to be big because people will find value in it regardless of politics or ethics.
But all new technology has moral and political implications, questions and possibilities. I don't see the harm in discussing them in a forum where everybody understands that technology.
War, like every other state program is funded by inflation and debt as well as taxes. Inflation and govt. dept would be impossible in a bitcoin only world. Tax and bitcoin is another discussion but I think it would make taxation a hell of a lot more difficult, considering the roles banks and other institutions play in informing the state about the movements of money.

Then why are dollars less volatile, despite more conjuring?

Still better than LocalBitcoins price and (potentially) cheaper / more convenient than making international transfers to use an overseas exchange.

Maybe it wasn't Karpeles fault, but we won't know unless he starts answering some tough questions.
There are too many mysteries surrounding the Mt Gox fiasco. If they were holding people's fiat, the legal system would have been much more effective. Because it was Bitcoin, it's all breezed by with a bit of handwaving and talk of security breaches.
Yes, maybe it wasn't his fault. Maybe maybe maybe... The guy owes the people who lost money some answers, for starters. Real answers that conform to the other evidence people have posted on here and what former employees have said. You want to talk about unprofessional...
Don't blame the victim. Sure, avoiding dark allies in shady parts of town at night is good advice. Maybe you're dumb if you get robbed when you could have avoided it. But the robber is the criminal and that is who we blame.
I'm sorry you lost money on Gox. I didn't. But it's definitely a 'there but for the grace of god' thing for me... I didn't even use Gox and I don't leave money on exchanges. Except if and when I do... because everyone makes mistakes, or takes risks and get caught-out . That doesn't make you a bad person or even an idiot necessarily. Stealing people's money or 'losing' people's money with no explanation does.

Me too. In fact I think everyone pays tax for this reason, regardless of what they claim.
If a mugger holds a gun to your head and asks for your wallet, you can tell me you're giving it to him because 'he needs it more than me' or some other reason but I wont believe you... The gun is a little less visible with taxation so it's easier to rationalise.

I think the solution to BTC loans lies in the value of a reputation.
If we can establish a good enough reputation model we should be able to attach a rough BTC value to a certain level of reputation.
If you have a reputation of X, I might estimate that to have a value of 10 BTC based on my estimate of the minimum you'd stand to lose if you were to lose that rep. That means that I might now feel comfortable loaning you up to 10 BTC.
The cool thing about this is that it doesn't actually matter who you are or where you live. All I need to know is two things 'juliohm has a reputation of X' and that 'you are juliohm'.
Just my 0.02BTC ; )

Seriously, why not post something like: "I find bitcoin too difficult to understand and I wonder if I'm alone", rather than claiming to speak for every non-'magic the gathering gamer nerd' and insulting your audience?
Perhaps it will, in fact, turn out that Bitcoin is incredibly simple and you are just an idiot...
I'm saying this with the best of intentions...

In 2003 between 8 and 30 million people worldwide participated in anti-war protests*. How did that turn out? Asking your govt to behave differently does not work. If we had the ability to withhold taxes then we'd have the ability to truly withdraw consent.
