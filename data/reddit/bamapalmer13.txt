My like 45 bucks I invested not too long ago is now 90. I know it isn't much but as a high schooler still very very happy.

oh boy Gdax seems way more complex, if I start investing more I will look into it more, for now the fees are minimal and its much simpler.

Alright, so it seems once my bitcoin transaction clears Coinbase I should at the least move all of it to mycelium? (Is this a good one to use) and hold it there. If I'm wrong please let me know.

As someone who bought in now through coin base bank transfer should I just as quickly as possible move to breadwallet? Granted, that won't be until the 20th.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:26:47
Alright, based on this:
And this:
It seems breadwallet may not be the best wallet for the split, as they will only follow one chain, and users may be unable to tell if they are doing transactions with BTC or the SegWit2x fork.  
However, it seems breadwallet is fine as long as you don't make transactions until the dust settles, which is probably the best thing to do regardless. 
Edit: if you're serious (which would be great, as that's lunch money for a week) And you don't get a better response or you have more questions, PM me and we could work out a transaction.

alright got bread wallet now.

As someone who only has pending transactions on Coinbase (should go through on the 20th or so) what should I do, I'm a new investor and confused.
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:10:27
Yeah I'm confused, where should I buy at this point and where should I store it? I'm working on investing like today so I want to know what I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:41:34
Yeah, I set up my account and bought 20 USD last night, now waiting, if there is a dip I'll put in some more.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:14:11
Alright, thanks this seems like sound advice, though I thought I heard something about Bread not taking the fork and only showing the dominant block or something?
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:08:13
Yep I've done that now, I guess I should leave my ETH AND LTC in Coinbase for now right?
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:49:36
I bought for the first time, so I guess I'm part of this club! Woot woot all about losing money for a bit then having more.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:40:28
Never too late, I bought some for the first time last night, already made back the transaction fee. If there is a big dip soon I may buy a bit more.
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:36:42
Thank you that's incredibly helpful, will do.  Also, what does this fork mean for prices? Is it a really good or really bad (or neither) time to buy?
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:03:17
Yeah I'm setting up my wallet today, coin base is fine right, no worries about using them? Think I'll go that route I found somewhere on this sub about consistently putting in a solid amount so over time you don't feel so bad riding the market.
Edit: after reading more on this sub it seems some kind of fork is happening? I read through the FAQ but am still confused, can anyone give me a general idea of what I should do to maximize my safety while not tanking earnings?
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:44:19
is blockchain any good? Breadwallet seems to get sketchier reviews on iOS at least.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:57:03
You should have told me there was a referral option I happily would have referred you.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:46:51
I love looking back on this only two months later.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:05:18
Should I use breadwallet or block chain as my local wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:42:04
Really well written, but I wish you would just send me 5 bitcoin :). No really, as a recent investor, I came to basically the same conclusion just later down the road, and appreciate the clear thought you put into this.
