No, it's really not. 90% of conversations I have about bitcoin are "What are bitcoins? What is it useful for? Is it illegal? How do I get it without going onto The Dark Web? I can't afford to buy a bitcoin!" As others have pointed out, awareness ≠ adoption. 
We are currently in the equivalent of the "lol why would I want to send an email when I could just send a fax?" phase of internet adoption. Bitcoin is still in its Usenet phase, and the Eternal September of Bitcoin hasn't begun yet. I think it's close, though.

You deposit fiat to an exchange. You buy bitcoin with it. The exchange keeps it in their online wallet which belongs to you. They don’t expose the private keys to you. If you want the private keys, you need a wallet on your computer (or a paper or hardware wallet, etc.) and you need to transfer your bitcoin to that wallet from the exchange. Some wallets support multiple coins.
Does that help?

Yeah, I get what you're saying. But I've also lived in countries where simple things cost thousands in the local monetary unit. So like a cup of coffee would be 10,000 "dollars" for instance. It didn't take long to adjust.
Anyway, it doesn't really matter if we settle on a naming convention if Bitcoin continues to be so unstable. I don't know if .00033 BTC for a cup of a coffee is a rip-off right off the top of my head because I don't know if Bitcoin shot up 200% overnight, for instance. (Assuming I'm buying coffee, that means my brain isn't working properly yet.) 
If Bitcoin ever stabilizes and people start using it for daily transactions, it won't take long before people adjust to thinking about monetary units in a different way. Just like I can move to China, for instance, and get used to paying over 20 yuan for a cup of coffee. Whereas paying over 20 dollars would be a giant rip-off. 
I get the logic behind adopting mBTC, I just don't think it's going to really do anything useful except cause confusion. 
Besides, it wasn't really that long ago that we (in America anyway) were used to thinking of things in fractions of a cent. Back when we had a deflationary currency: 
You might have even been able to buy a cup of coffee for $0.005 back then. I'm just doing some research and it looks like you could buy coffee for $0.25 per kilogram. And if it takes 10 grams to make a cup of coffee, that means enough coffee to make a cup would cost $0.0025. So if we had Keurig machines back in 1857 a K-cup might cost $0.005. :) 
I know that seems like a bit of a rant, but do you get what I'm saying?

If you install a wallet on your computer and generate an address, you have both the public and the private keys. You need both in order to access the funds. You only need the public key to send funds to an address. 
For a paper wallet, for instance, when you generate an address it shows you the public and private keys. You need both in order to control the funds. 
Online exchanges only show you the public key. So in order to have control over your funds, you need to transfer your money to a wallet that you control on one of your devices or a paper wallet, for instance. 
I don't know a whole lot about which wallets are the best. I use bitcoin core, etc. You should consider looking into hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger Nano S.

I like how he mentions diamonds even though diamonds are well known to be an unscarce resource that has been artificially inflated in value by a combination of marketing and artificial limitation of supply. If diamonds are inherently worthless and they can have great value, so too can Bitcoin based on that logic. The difference is that Bitcoin actually has inherent value and utility. (Diamonds do too, particularly in manufacturing, but you get my point.) Bitcoin is commoditized trust, among other things. 
I also love the gold argument. This seems to be the favored anti-bitcoin argument of old people who watch too much news. Gold is only valuable because we think it's shiny and we've decided that it has value. "But gold has practical application." Like what? Satellites, crowns for teeth, electronics? Then why has it been valued for literally all of human history before any of the practical applications were invented? 
I also also love the "USD is backed by the Federal Reserve" argument. What is the Fed going to do if everyone decided the dollar is worthless? They can't do shit. USD is backed worldwide by the faith that it'll continue to hold its value. It can be replaced.

Meh, I get the argument that people don't understand immediately that bitcoin is divisible.
But you also have to be an informed investor. One of the first things that you learn about Bitcoin is that it is divisible, and that the smallest unit of a Bitcoin is called a Satoshi. 
It's just like gold. You don't have to buy a whole gold ingot. You can buy fractions of ounces. 
The vast majority of people are financially illiterate anyway. A simple change to naming convention is not going to solve that problem. In fact, it might cause more confusion. "Now what's a milli-bit-coin? I barely understand what a regular bitcoin is!"

Coinbase, for all its flaws, is still a pretty good step in the direction of "the facebook of bitcoin." It makes it super easy for regular people to buy, hold, and transact with bitcoin. 
Any service with an exchange and a mobile wallet like Coinbase, once they implement segwit and when lightning gets going, will allow real everyday transactions with bitcoin to be as simple and seamless as current monetary transactions. People are already getting used to paying with an app (apple pay, android pay, etc.).

Opportunity cost isn't necessarily relevant here. Opportunity cost is when you put money into one thing and it prevents you from making money in another thing. So, like, buying a car has opportunity cost because you could take that money and invest in bitcoin. But you still need a car, so you buy the car. That money is tied up in owning a car, and thus has opportunity cost.

I'm not offended at all, I appreciate the discourse. I just think that you majorly underestimate bitcoin itself as a world-wide game changer, something that could truly alter the course of human civilization specifically *because* there are (almost) no mechanisms in place to allow established power systems to control it. The only thing "they" could do to stop it would be to shut down the entire internet, but we have satellites and shit now... 
I do disagree with you about what critical thinking means. I don't think it means basically 'entertaining all possibilities, however silly.' It means considering ideas and applying logic to see if they hold up to scrutiny. It is perfectly acceptable in critical thinking to abandon a hypothesis if it doesn't stand up to a few initial tests. The idea that "bitcoin could have been created by shadowy elites to basically trick people into continuing to be subject to their power" just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. 


You've flipped from your original statement here. Your original statement was (emphasis mine): 


You're now saying:


Which was basically my first point, which is that nobody knows who Satoshi is but it doesn't make sense for him to represent global elites. 


No offense, but I think it's terrible form in intelligent conversation to tell the other party that they need to "do research." Granted, it may have been unfair of me to question your critical thinking skills. However, I've been following Bitcoin and crypto since 2011 and I think I have a fairly strong grasp of what it is, how it functions, where it came from, what it's useful for, what problems it solves, and where it is probably headed. To that end, I think you might be the one who needs to do more research. You posted 6 months ago that you are "fairly new in the crypto space." I don't pretend to be a be-all-end-all expert, but I have definitely "done my research."

That's not OP's address, that's the address of the person who originally made the graph/predictions.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:59:55
If bitcoin hits USD $1M that would put 1 satoshi on parity with 1 penny. That would put bitcoin's market cap at around USD $20 trillion. That's equivalent to the USA's nominal GDP, which is currently about 25% of the entire world's gross product. By some estimates there's only about $60 trillion dollars in the world, so that would mean Bitcoin would be 33% of all global currency. I'm not too sure about that. 
It is entirely possible that Bitcoin will never hit $1M. The implications are, to my feeble human brain, unimaginable. And I am afraid that only a global financial and environmental disaster of unimaginable proportions would cause Bitcoin to have that kind of market dominance. You're talking about basically all of the world's major currencies becoming insolvent. That's not really a world that I want to live in... 
Now, $100,000? That's not so hard to imagine. That would put Bitcoin at about twice the market cap of one company: Apple, Inc. There is a **lot** of room for growth between $100k and $1M, and it may take "forever."

Yeah, I don't think anyone would fault him if he cashed out a little bit (just like nobody faults a CEO for selling some company stock to buy a yacht), but I do think it would cause mass panic if he suddenly sold off all of his coins. It would also effectively immediately end his anonymity. 
His account was active in 2014, so it's possible he's still around and hasn't died. (Unless he was Hal Finney all along...) 
Personally I think it's most likely that he represents a group rather than a lone genius. But it's possible that one of them had access to the keys and who knows what happened to them. 
It will be very interesting to find out if and when the truth surfaces... 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:05:16

If Bitcoin were created by shady private elites, I don't think the code would be open source or allow outside contributors to the core code by a democratic method. Rich private interests always keep control of things. This is not in their control by any stretch of the imagination. 
Nobody knows who Satoshi is, but why would he represent a conglomerate of global elites? There's still an unimaginable amount of money (trillions upon trillions) in private banks that *real* shady back-room anonymous elites control. Bitcoin is a threat to that establishment. Why would they seek to provide an alternative to an already extremely profitable system that they control? 
There are many conspiracy theories about Satoshi, but this one doesn't make any sense at all. 
Edit: Also, trust in banks has absolutely **not** vanished. Look at the number of people who don't trust Bitcoin specifically because it's not backed up by a bank or government institution. Yawn...

What mechanisms exist that would allow "them" to control Bitcoin? There are no secret backdoor levers to control the price of Bitcoin or anything about it. "They" can do some market manipulation--but only because Bitcoin is still in its very early days and is barely worth more than a large company (versus the institutional wealth "they" control which is greater than most large countries, so "they" can throw their weight around). 
The hypothesis just doesn't make any sense.

You totally flopped your original argument, and now you're attacking an argument that I haven't made, citing presuppositions I haven't addressed, attacking logic I haven't used, and making personal attacks. You're also completely misconstruing your own argument, reframing it so that you can continue to say things in a different way in order to save face. Your original idea and the ensuing arguments you've provided don't make any sense, and that's about it. I haven't addressed the problem of mining monopolization, and in fact this is the first time I'm using the word. So, you're basically arguing with yourself now.

You have a few options: 
- Does your country have bitcoin ATMs? Those can be a good place to purchase. 
- You could use a market like - You could use a bitcoin escrow service and set up to buy from an individual. Google "bitcoin escrow" and look into it. 
Unfortunately if you don't have an exchange that operates in your country it puts you in a bit of a vulnerable position, because it opens you up to being scammed. But, it also opens up people who sell to you to scams. If I sold you bitcoin, for instance, and you used paypal to send me fiat, there is a possibility that you could cancel the transaction from your end and I'd be screwed. 
Another option that I might suggest is for you to find a real person you trust who you can buy bitcoin from in person with physical currency. You can sit in a coffee shop or something with them and have them send you the bitcoin, then you can hand them cash once you've verified that you've received it. You might want to wait a certain amount of time to verify the transaction. 
It's not easy yet in most countries, but it'll get there. Best of luck!

Yes, you're right. Coinbase makes it super simple but also has higher fees. GDAX is more of a real exchange with buy and sell orders and stop loss and etc. It's frankly kind of complicated unless you have experience with stocks. You can then transfer USD from Coinbase to GDAX and make your transaction on GDAX with lower fees. 
Have fun!

I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like you've already decided how you're going to proceed. And that's fine. 
When it comes to a technical startup, you either know how to code, have really good friends who know how to code, or you have to pay somebody to code for you (sometimes a combination of 2 or 3). There's really no getting around it.

Welcome! I love your username. 
Where have you read that coinbase is bad? I use them and I have never had any trouble with them. I also personally like that they are incorporated and operate in the US, and have funding. They seem to me like the most trustworthy exchange, and personally that makes their fees worth it.
If you don't like their fees, you could also use GDAX which is operated by Coinbase and has lower fees. 
Definitely do your research about wallets, though! I will personally never trust an online wallet again after what happened with Mt. Gox!

Articles like this show exactly why you can't trust the vast majority of journalists and media corps to report on cryptocurrency. The same institutions that have been unable to do quality reporting on even the most basic science news for decades now have absolutely no hope of understanding crypto or doing a fair job reporting on it. 
This title is unbelievably horrible. The article itself isn't that bad, but you can tell that the copy editor who titled this article has no clue what they're talking about and should probably retire, or ask a younger editor to title it. It's as bad as giving the title "Microsoft investors could lose all their money" to a hypothetical article about how $SNAP is a shitty stock that has lost IPO investors a lot of money.
Leave the crypto reporting to people who at least know how to use a computer.

Did your CS major son-in-law take any economics classes? A lot of CS majors are very smart, but it's also a "safe" major. Nothing against CS majors; I'm sure he understands the technology but I don't think a CS degree alone is enough to back up his speculations. At this point you're better suited to understanding the future if bitcoin if you understand economics and people. There are a lot of very smart computer scientists working on solving the problems with bitcoin that computer scientists understand. 
Also I googled that professor. He seems to have some very valid criticisms of bitcoin in specific and blockchain technology in general, but he's also very passionate about it. Because there are valid criticisms doesn't mean it's a bad thing or will never be successful. 
There were a lot of technologists who didn't see a future for the internet, or the personal computer, etc. Put 100 ivy league CS grads in a room and I'll bet you that the majority of them would be optimistic about bitcoin. Not that their degree makes them any more qualified to make that prediction, of course... Then put 100 ivy league finance majors in a room and then it gets interesting... 
As to the matter of missing coins, I don't see how it's any more relevant to the overall value of bitcoin than missing gold would be to the value of gold. In fact, I would think that permanently destroyed coins would only increase the value of the remaining coins. Maybe I'm overlooking something here.

@_date: 2017-09-03 18:15:36
I see what you're saying but I respectfully disagree. 
I have had a much better experience explaining it to non-bitcoiners and getting them interested in it by explaining it as a digital commodity, like a "digital gold." They get it immediately, and it's a good explanation. You know we used to buy and sell things for precious metals which are inherently worthless, right? There's nothing special about gold other than its scarcity and difficulty of attaining it. Ah, yes, this is the point where the eyes light up. Then what if you had a system where you could instantly and securely send gold anywhere in the world? 
I've had much more difficulty explaining it as money. And I think this is because people then start to think of bitcoin as a foreign currency. And it's not. There's no predictable exchange rate. In the past 10 years or so, for instance, Canadian dollar vs. US dollar has fluctuated somewhere between 70% to 130%. Bitcoin is a totally different ball game. I wouldn't trust a foreign currency with as much volatility as Bitcoin, and neither would most lay people. 
I also think you show people that you know what you're talking about if you give them a more honest comparison. And I don't think you know what you're talking about if you think Bitcoin is more like money than a commodity. You can *use it like money*, but you can also use gold like money if you have enough people who are willing to transact using it. Same challenge that presents bitcoin. 
Besides, the IRS taxes Bitcoin as a commodity. So capital gains tax applies. And lay people care about that. If you don't explain it up front, you might scare them off. 
I've personally convinced dozens of people to invest in bitcoin, and have at least piqued the interest of dozens more. They are all currently seeing a really nice return on their small investments. I explained it to them all in terms of a commodity.

Not sure I agree with your logic. I see it more like leaching on the bitcoin community. Vendors who accept bitcoin as a form of payment is great, but it also defeats the purpose if they only intend to exchange their BTC for fiat. 
What I want to see is a BTC economy forming, where vendors accept BTC payment and they use it for their own necessities from vendors who accept btc, forming a loop. A politician will *only* sell their BTC for fiat, and that doesn't accomplish anything for bitcoin. 
Would be different if we were talking about a major politician, because that would really generate awareness.

Since you've bought a little over 1 BTC, that puts you in the top 3% of bitcoin holders (about 600,000). And that doesn't account for holders who distribute their holdings in multiple addresses.
To put things in perspective, there are only 3M addresses with &gt;100 USD in them. Only 1.2M with &gt;1,000 USD. Only 300,000 with &gt;10,000 USD.

Nothing sophisticated. I just pay attention to what the community is saying, volume of buy and sell orders on exchanges, bitcoin in the news, and my own gut feeling. I do dollar-cost averaging so I don't make rash decisions, but I do feel like it's okay to hold off if it's clear that prices are in a free fall. 
One thing I'm going to be paying attention to is the news about the bitcoin ETF and the SEC. If it's looking like the ETF won't get approved, I think there will be a major price slump. But it's only a matter of time before bitcoin goes truly mainstream. And at that point it's going to be yuge. If the ETF does get approved, I think there will be a modest-to-major volume inflow and thus price increase. But I'm just going to continue doing DCA and hodling. 
Edit: I should clarify that I don't treat bitcoin as a means to generate fiat, my singular goal is to accumulate bitcoin and some altcoin. If you look at it as more of a day-trading thing, you probably shouldn't listen to me. I just try to buy low and hodl.

Don't feel like an idiot! This stuff is pretty complicated. I've been following/investing in bitcoin since 2011 and I am still unclear on some things. 
Transactions take a fairly long time to confirm in bitcoin. Basically, in this situation, your mining pool has "discovered" X number of blocks worth Y bitcoin, and it will take a while for the Bitcoin network to "confirm" these discoveries. It takes a while. Once it's confirmed, your mining pool will make the payout to you, which will also then take a while to confirm. 
Bitcoin takes some patience!
