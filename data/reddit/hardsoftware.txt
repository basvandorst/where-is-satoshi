Is that an order ?

I heard that entire comment in Comic Book Guy's voice.

It's like that episode of Cheers where everyone begs Norm to let them in on a tanning salon and then they all get scared and pull out but it's successful anyway, and now they're all pissed at Norm.

They'll have about the same success suppressing crypto currency as they've had with bit torrent.

This argument assumes the regulators' goal is to benefit citizens and society. It is not. The goal is career advancement and protection of the status quo at any cost. Facts and logic are not effective weapons in this case.

It's a metaphor mister literal. Like "burning cash", "flushing money down the toilet" or "I went on stage and killed last night". Using "extant" instead of existing in a non technical context is literal pedantry. (I.e. being a wanker (in popular parlance)).
May one be so bold, dear reader, (you) as to enquire - are you a virgin ? I.e. (in essence) have you engaged in sexual congress with a human ? (I.e. person). 
My apologies for any potential miss-placement of commas or question marks, indeed any syntactic errors are attributable to my abject failure in the pursuit of my dream of becoming an electrical engineer.
Would you be so kind as to clarify how the common person's understanding of "wanker" differs from "tosser" ?
I suffer from a modicum of naïvety in the "Umgangssprache" one encounters contemporarily, however my avocation as a so-called "comic book retail assistant" in a popular mass-media animation or "cartoon" (as it is commonly framed in contemporary parlance), remains secure.
Beware dear readers !  "Comic Books" do not contain an actual "stand-up "comedian"" !
Beware dear readers ! Always ascertain that all open parentheses are nullified by an equivalent integer ("whole" number) number of close parentheses. If not, immediately disregard any assertions made by the author. Think !
On a personal note, I very much enjoyed your "so-called""think-piece" in the "New Yorker" on the flagrant abuse of the "so-named" "Oxford comma", I agree. It's an affront to our very humanity, ethicality, and indeed élan vital.
"Thank" you.
