*- Don't buy a hardware wallet from anyone other than the company who makes it, i.e. do not buy one on Amazon, it is possible some third person hacked it and could steal your coin*
So I did this. I bought a Ledger Nano S off of Amazon. It passes Attestation each time I've used it.. but I don't want to take any unnecessary risks. Am I good, or do you guys and girls suggest I buy a new Ledger Nano S directly from Ledger, and move my bitcoin from the old to the new? Thanks for any help you can offer.

Mine was Back Bay Outfitters. No, they didn't express concern directly, but it was enough for me that they said they weren't an authorized reseller. They sent me this URL for authorized resellers;

Hey man- I wanted to let you know that I reached out to Ledger with our concern. They asked me who my Amazon seller was, and I told them. They told me they were not an authorized Reseller. I transferred my crypto back to coinbase, wiped that wallet, and returned that wallet to Amazon. In the meantime, I got one straight from Ledger's website, and my crypto is now on that wallet.

Yeah, I'll edit my post. My post is confusing.

You got it

Thanks for the advice! I contacted Ledger customer support, and they asked me who the Seller was on Amazon. I told them, and they informed me that they were not an authorized Reseller. I wiped that wallet, and returned it, and my crypto is now on a Ledger purchased directly from them.
