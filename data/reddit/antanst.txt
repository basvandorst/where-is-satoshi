Indeed you didn't; my apologies for this. Nevertheless I believe the arguments made by the devs replying to you at that thread still stand.

You posted this at the Monero subreddit, and you've been debunked multiple times by two Monero developers:

Yeah, not to mention that you must backup your wallet on every transaction. Very usable.

Miners will always have the need for predictable returns, this being the primary incentive to merge into pools. How does the decreasing ASIC hardware efficiency help on that front?

Works for me. Try refreshing your browser cache.

Privacy. Bitcoin is a privacy nightmare. If you thought that banks are not private enough, wait until Bitcoin gets mainstream.
The problem with privacy is that it's very difficult to add as a feature. It's an all-or-nothing approach. Wasabi-like solutions are half measures at best.
Don't get me wrong, I believe that Bitcoin will continue to be the most stable and dependable crypto-currency in the near future. But there will be great need for another solution as well.

Most altcoins are crap and cheap clones, but there is a small number of coins that have critical innovations compared to Bitcoin. Such as Monero. And satoshi would agree: [
So yeah, Saifedean is wrong on this one.

May I suggest also taking a look at Ad Nauseum?

And why do we still keep giving merit to this charlatan?

This is by far the most usable and well designed wallet I've used. No delays, multiple wallet handling, intuitive interface, Payment Protocol support...Couple those with the fact that both the client and server parts are open source, and you've got a winner.
Thank you Bitpay.

I recently bought a Trezor. I can't recommend it enough.
I'm waiting for third-party clients to get better, the only one that's working right now seems to be Electrum 2, but it doesn't support multiple accounts afaik.
myTrezor wallet works fine, but it's a bit limited (for example, it doesn't allow descriptions in transactions)
This thing has a bright future. Give it some time.

Enough with jl777's crap.

Amen. I wonder how much crying and yelling could have been avoided if this came earlier.

By the way, all articles from CoinTelegraph should be flagged as spam.

Bitcoin decentralized payments, OB will decentralize trading (hopefully).

This article, while having some valid points (re the toxicity and censorship of this community for example) on the whole is actually sounds quite naive and immature, like coming from someone who has his priorities completely messed up, and/or intends to act prematurely.

Thanks for the suggestion. My concern is what you mentioned, and I'd rather continue to avoid touching Chrome at all. I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on the desktop version that's coming (thanks @_date: 2016-07-27 16:52:58
Do you plan to release a "true" desktop version of GreenAddress? By that I mean a desktop app that's not a chrome extension. Currently that's what deters me from using GreenAddress.

Cool. Σε ποιό γυμναστήριο είν'αυτό;
