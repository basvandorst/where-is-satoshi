To compare crypro is now what internet was 1992 ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:15:13
It was only a little calculation based on what i read yesterday. You never can consider all variables. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:41:44
It's a ecosystem we need the miners and the miners need us. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:44:36
Sure it will change your live. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:53:52
The crypto eco system is very new and all time moving. You can compare the crypto ecosystem with the internet in 1992. There are many changes coming. Small transactions will get handled by sitechain's maybe. 
Notice the idea behind bitcoin is a safe storage for money and not a currency for every day life. 
For me the best concept for microtransactions at the moment is IOTA.

Haha this post is really funny. No dumps anymore. I tell you when the big whales begin to sell the FUD is instantly there. many traders sell there Coins for alts after the 2x fork. At least many new guys in the market begin to panic and sell to. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:00:26
I dont think so.
The better question is how worse are the current systems in energy terms. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:06:29
Bitcoin Gold already have replay protection implemented 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:08:36

Split your money in 5 parts, invest one part now. After the 2x Fork another part. The remaining parts in one week rhytm. That would I do. ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:57:42
I am 19 young years to and i know that feeling. But now i am the one who laugh. ;) 
I buy 12 btc in December last year with all my savings (yes i know the rule: only invest what you can 100% loss). Only one Friend was interested and put little bit money in. Now he says thanks to me.
But slowly my trust in btc gets smaller and i buying tons of IOTA. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:55:14
Split your money in three or four part's buy with one part NOW. One part after the fork and the last when it dips. Maybe invest a little part in ETH, XRP or IOTA.
Thats the way i would do it. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:09:37
Okey that is comletely my opinion
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:21:14
TenX Card is the best 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:49:53
Yes i know. Since i am invested in crypto i inform myselve to this theme. Cause knowledge is power.
I spread my portfolio in 5 Part's. Two major part's = BTC and IOTA and three smaller part's of XRP, PAY and ETH. ;)
