Are many people selling btc at the moment? I’ve been away for a while and now it looks like there isn’t much for sale.

What’s going on? I thought we were about to zoom past the ath and head straight for the moon.

I wish I’d discovered that guy. Look at all those free pills there, can’t afford my own.
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:37:10
But.. I thought the bounce was gonna shoot us to Mars. I’m so confused.

Damn right, the quickest way is to burrow straight to the earth’s core until the heat and pressure catapults us to the moon at lightning speed.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:08:54
Moon soon
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:15:15
It’s climbing back up now, moon soon.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:10:56
Sold half bruv.
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:47:20
So when we gonna zoom past the ath and head to the moon? Can’t be long now.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:08:17
Their words.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:15:30
One btc per band?
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:46:11
Of course, I’ve taken out a 20k loan to tie me over until moon.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:11:31
I've got about 150% what I started with. Not sure whether to bail or not.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:56:56
It’s going down to under 800 dollars.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:04:33
Predictions for the next 12 hours?
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:39:46
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:12:39
About right.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:00:08
It is, we’ll hit ath next week, or early new year at the latest
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:42:13
It didn’t stop me.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:44:14
What do all those fingers mean?
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:26:18
Right around the corner.
