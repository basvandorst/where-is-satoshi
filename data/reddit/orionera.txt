Dratel seems pretty well prepared but ran into trouble with Kiernan today. He kept trying to get Kiernan to say certain things--for instance, that running BitTorrent was essentially asking to get hacked because of the open ports--and Kiernan was visibly shaking his head. It got combative.
Dratel has said a few incorrect things. I don't think he's the most tech savvy dude in the world. I do think he's immensely prepared in that regard, and most of what he's said has been spot on.
The judge hasn't said anything to read really.
The prosecutors have left most of the tech explanations up to the witnesses but when they do speak on that, it's spot on.
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:03:40
When Dratel would say something to the effect of "Don't open ports mean you can hacked?" Kiernan would shake his head and say "That's how the internet works, you open ports for programs, it doesn't mean you're unprotected."
(that's not verbatim except "that's how the internet works" which kiernan said repeatedly)

I think you and are bringing up what a lot of people have been thinking. 
I wrote in  about many of the mistakes that were made but the list is even longer than that. There were a lot of mistakes made and every day seems to point out new ones. Today we learned about just how many people Ulbricht confessed his role in SR to, for instance.
Kind of amazing.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:35:50
No but there's a lot of trial yet to go.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:17:03
My own opinion to him has been stuck with so many qualifiers, so many what if's, for so long that it was vague as hell to begin with. My opinion now, based on the evidence that's been presented, is that he was ambitious and creative but got in way, WAY over his head. 
I think we sort of knew that before but the trial has really driven that home. In particular, the Variety Jones and Richard Bates information show just how much Ulbricht relied on others. For a project of this magnitude, that doesn't seem like the right move.
On Variety Jones: 
I'm thankful that, like a normal 20-something, I come up with big ideas that I never follow through on. Laziness pays off again.

I agree, that possibility definitely exists. However, forget the profits, maybe he thinks he can keep the identifying details about the trades more secret/protected on his own platform? Just guessing and really that's all we can do. 
Whether or not that's really what's happening, though, is a different question.

Ubuntu, I can't remember the exact version but it was relatively up to date at the time of the arrest so that's not hard to look up. I saw a virtual machine in the directories, which made it seem like Whonix was also run at least occasionally.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:13:32
I dunno but what we all have been noticing is how Dratel dresses him. Ulbricht is a young looking dude, baby face and lots of hair, and he's dressed very proper. He looks like he's fresh from a boarding school, albeit he may have been left back a few years. He looks early 20s, not mid or late. I have no idea how that plays with the jury but it's interesting to wonder how Dratel presumably (bc lawyers dress defendants with a reason in mind) came up with that.
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:20:10
Yes and yes
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:43:32
Well, it is evidence, but it's not proof. You've basically summed up a big part of what Dratel's case seems to be: A second DPR saying all this would get him off the hook. Dratel's cross examination of Kiernan today was (somewhat indirectly) about the possibility of Ulbricht being hacked and, for lack of a better word, framed for a long time period--i.e. the logs were on his laptop but who created them, who put them there?
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:50:43
yes, the judge handles her other work on Fridays.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:56:09
That's the big question, right? A blind guess is investor, he got a %, since he wasnt listed on the payroll docs shown. But that is, like I said, a blind guess.
Actually, here's something I recall: The prosecution popped on I think a payroll document from late 2013 listing several names. One was redacted. Don't know who it was, didn't get a chance to count names and see if anyone obvious was missing, but the redaction sticks out in my memory.
We only get to see /some/ of the evidence and only for brief time periods before they're taken away, so don't take too much from the fact that we haven't seen something.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:51:04
The initial estimate was 4-6 weeks and no one thinks it's going faster than expected, so probably another 4 weeks.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:40:39
My understanding is that she certainly has a reputation as such.
I'm not a lawyer, so it's hard for me to really dive in depth on some of the decisions she's made, but she's definitely made a few mistakes. For instance, now allowing Dratel to question Kiernan about Ulbricht's computer was legally the wrong move (as far as I understand it) and could open the case up to appeal. Then she seemed to tell Dratel, in front of the jury, that he should bring his own witness for that. That's a big no no too, and she had to backtrack and tell the jury to disregard that.
Other than that and maybe one or two other moments, it seems like she's trying to keep an even hand. Definitely reasonable and no one is perfect.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:31:06
Kiernan, the FBI computer scientist, pretty clearly knows what he's talking about. However, he's also very clearly concerned with explaining things in a way that the jury will understand. That causes him to kind of drone on, repeat himself, and be less clear than he should be. It's weird.
Jared Der-Yeghiayan, the Homeland Security Investigations agent and undercover agent who ran the Cirrus account, seems to be mostly an average ability computer user, so he is definitely out his depth when it comes to the more complex questions. But that's why they brought Kiernan in.
There is very little technical discussion when the jury is absent, so I haven't had a chance to see what they'd say without that in the mix.

cannot confirm nor deny
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:11:26
Ideally, yeah I'll get or help get more transcripts. I'm working on that now, more info asap.
I think the defense strategy wasn't perfect to begin with but has run into a big obstacle in the form of the judge's decisions. Dratel hasn't been able to approach cross examinations in the way he wanted to bc the judge won't let him. That's a big problem for the defense.
Variety Jones is huge, at least in my mind. I do wonder what offers if any the govt made. It seems increasingly likely that they made none, that they want to make Ross an example. Maybe the trial was an attempt to win a few years back on sentencing? I have no idea, I'm just guessing in the dark, but we're all waiting for Dratel's next big move.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:20:35
When the judge asked Dratel directly something like "Is it your position that Karpeles was DPR?", Dratel responded "It's our position that he could be."
With that in mind, plus the rest of the trial, it seems like he won't be producing much in the way of solid evidence that Karpeles was really involved.
Another noteworthy moment from yesterday: Chat logs showed DPR recommending against using Mt Gox to staffers. One could fathom some kind of situation where Karpeles wouldn't want staffers on his site but the simplest explanation suggests it wasn't Karpeles or an associate talking.
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:05:46
And that's with a relative discount, if you're actually party to the trial it actually costs around $7k. nuts, huh?
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:10:59
Oh, yeah, after the trial they are free to do whatever they want and anyone can reach out to them.
Actually, on the contrary, I see things the jury doesn't. The judge gets them out of the room to discuss issues all the time, everyone else can stay and listen.
no, the defense can and has introduced evidence.

@_date: 2015-01-23 02:22:27
I've been thinking about Variety Jones a lot. Now, I've only been able to read a small portion of their chats but I'd hesitate before calling him evil or manipulative. Maybe the latter, maybe, but from the small portions of chat we've read, he seems more like a smart partner who gave Ross good advice. I could be wrong though, there's a lot more to learn about him.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:34:49
That's one way to go at it. As a member of the media, I would suggest an alternative is to just choose wisely, because we're not one block entity.

Thanks, means a lot coming from you.
Most of what has been said in court about him I published here: 
He is incredibly intriguing, I totally agree. 
Here are his SR forum posts, I've looked over a few: 
Like I posted on Twitter, it seems that two people contributed enormously to SR: Jones and Bates. From mid-2011 all the way to the end, Jones was playing a big role. When Smedley, the highest paid SR staffer, would build security for SR, it was Jones who was tasked with testing it. He was the final bar to cross. So that gives us a good idea how the level he continued to maintain throughout SR's lifespan. And the chats proved he played a huge role in the beginning too.

Actually, she's relatively good about that. There are like 3 breaks per day and jurors can have drinks and small amounts of food, like a candy bar, in the box, which is not always the case. It's still probably not easy.

@_date: 2015-01-23 16:48:12
My background is journalism, I don't claim to be very tech savvy. That said, because of the area I cover (this stuff) and the fact that I've done it for years, I would say I've become much more technically proficient than a lot of my colleagues. Low bar to cross but still.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:09:30
I don't know about that but one thing I'm impressed with is how positive Ross and his mother seem to be in particular. The family is there and lots of his supporters too but those two in particular seem, from what I've seen, to be holding up remarkably well all things considered. Both smiled at Richard Bates today as if to let him know they didn't blame him while Bates could barely look at anyone.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:08:04
Well, I can say that you could feel the air being sucked out of the courtroom today as some of the evidence was presented.
The prosecution first got Richard Bates to say that Ross told him he sold the site in 2011. Then we went to break. There was a lot of conversation: "Why did they do that?"
I figured another shoe would drop eventually.
After the cross examination, the prosecution said they had one more piece of evidence to publish. They were the chats with Variety Jones where he basically allegedly invents the DPR name and in which Ulbricht allegedly says he lied to his friends about selling the site.
It was quite a moment in that room, you can imagine I'm sure.
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:14:51
Karpeles didn't say he knew, iirc, he said he would offer who he *thought* was the owner of SR. The actual name was never given because a deal was never struck.
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:04:38
It's impossible to know what the jury is thinking but there have been comments made by trial observers that they thought Dratel's strategy here could backfire: Many of the jurors are older, minorities, and not particularly wealthy. It could be the boarding school look doesn't play at all. But people were just guessing.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:46:02
If StExo == VJ then my fucking head will melt
I want to look over the VJ chat logs more for sure to get a feel for his writing style. I'm not sure it seems similar to StExo. StExo, as you know, was a lot more self-aggrandizing.
Also, on a personal note, the more I read about StExo the more I realize he was telling me the truth about a lot of crazy stuff back in our private conversations in 2013. And it's really surprising.

@_date: 2015-01-23 02:17:04
I'm very much in the dark in regard to what Dratel's plan is at this point, so every time he gets up to cross examine a witness, i'm on the edge of my seat.
As far as who is left to testify, I only know some of the prosecution's witnesses and I don't know any of the defense's, so I can't give a complete list. I don't think any media really knows it.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:12:23
Good question but hard to say obviously.
He has a lot of supporters and  people here, I don't think they think he's anything but a hero from what I've heard. A lot of others have sympathy for him because he's facing a huge sentence obviously and the evidence is hitting hard.
If you're asking about the jury, that's something we're all wondering about but it's really hard to read. Some smile, some seem to nod off to sleep, but none are really giving anything away to us.

For all that Dratel has been criticized, I think he did a good job spinning doubt during closing arguments. I'd be shocked if a few jurors weren't seriously considering what he posed, i.e. digital evidence is unreliable.
Some quotes from Dratel that sum up his argument: The evidence could have been planted, "fabricated, distorted, moved, manipulated"
"The impenetrability of the computer screen has deprived us of certainty." 
 "The internet is not what it seems."
Internet fraud is real and, more importantly, there's a lot of people who are made uncomfortable in the digital world because of it. Dratel zeroed in on this and put almost the entire case on that notion. It seemed like a smart play given what he had, but I don't know that it will be enough to get Ross off.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:05:43
Like you said, it could've been a red herring. No one mentioned anything but I'd be shocked if it wasn't looked into. He talked about a lot of real life shit but I'm not sure it was enough to solidly ID him or anything like that.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:43:01
I'm not saying I believe one side over the other, I'm saying it seems like both sides agree/concede the fact that others played a big role in SR. Both sides agree on Bates and probably VJ. Defense probably does not concede that Ross was around during Smed's time though.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:27:03
If they're not there, I doubt they exist
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:00:56
Good question. It also seemed like Dratel changed the story during closing arguments, saying Ross's bitcoins were from Silk Road but they were given to him by the real DPR. In essence, they were an investment by the real DPR in order to complete his getaway and stay free, an investment that paid off when Ulbricht was arrested and BTC skyrocketed in price.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:37:48
he had 3 roommates, and the rent may have been 1400, i can't recall exactly at the moment.
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:58:42
Judging by the evidence, Ross lived closer to ramen noodles than royalty. But he still did pay over $1k rent in SF and went on vacations and worked out of net cafes. He wasn't exactly living in poverty, in other words.
I dont think he personally knew the other DPR because the defense was all about "possible" DPRs, with no certainty on any one potential alternative (even Karpeles). I'm not sure what your follow up question is here, can you clarify?
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:48:25
Oh oh, this is good. I'm going with Variety Jones and Smed. The mentor behind a lot of big moves at SR and the highest paid staffer and a programmer with direct access. In terms of who played the biggest roles behind the scenes, these two seemed to be major played with the smarts to get me the flags.
I assume we're talking Def-Con style CTF btw. If real CTF, Ross seems pretty athletic!
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:55:28
Quite a bit, actually. He talked about Karpeles a lot. He said Mark had motive, not just as a potential real DPR but also as someone who would profit when BTC prices skyrocketed following SR's closure.
I was surprised given, like you said, Karpeles talk had been clamped down on.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:25:29
I've found that trying to predict BTC's price is a sure way to look dumb, so I have no idea. I certainly didn't predict what happened when Ulbricht was arrested.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:03:20
I don't think the feds have mentioned anything publicly. I'm open to all theories at this point.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:28:30
It does! I haven't had a chance to dive into it as deeply as some others already have but I agree, there are interesting bits.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:09:34
He was living with 4 people but yes, it's not a big price considering SF being hugely expensive. My point is, though, that's a pretty nice city he was living in, he took vacations, he wasn't living inside his house like a monk.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:08:14
Dratel almost certainly has appeal in mind. He's filed for a mistrial five times. The judge, in her own letters, has made clear she sees that Dratel is trying to rack up "appeal points." I can't say whether or not it will be successful but I'd be shocked if that wasn't a big big consideration on Dratel's mind right now.
There's also the question of money. This is really expensive for the Ulbrichts. Can they afford another round?
As for Ross telling his whole story, I'm not really sure. I can't fully figure out why Dratel didn't tell more of the story, call more of his own witnesses, and publish more of his own evidence this week during the defense case. But there is more they'd like to say, so if they get a second shot maybe they can succeed to get it in.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:26:04
Extremely little. Basically, she ran down her resume and then said she reviewed text files on the laptop and email files from the gmail account from between 6/18/13 and 10/18/13. She never specified what they were at sat down. It was bizarre.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:04:22
Ross is probably the least emotional looking Ulbricht. The mom was demonstrative, the dad looks stoic, the extended family and friends are wearing their own expressions. Ross, during this period at least, didn't seem to give away much.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:32:32
About a day in total. He called four people who knew Ulbricht personally and one investigator named Bridget Pierce. The testimony lasted from 5-8 minutes each, extremely quick.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:26:57
For the most part, pretty attentive looking. 
I've seen some with what look like closed eyes but I've closed my eyes once or twice during this trial and I'm personally very interested.
Judge gives them ample breaks, coffee, tea, snacks, etc. They're paying attention as best I can tell.
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:51:53
One thing that comes to mind is that it seems he played a smaller role at Silk Road than I had previously thought, no matter if you believe the defense or prosecution.
Of course he started the thing but, according to the government, Variety Jones was behind a lot of what was happening. Richard Bates played a big role in the initial construction of the site. Smed and other staffers handled major tasks a few years on. 
Obviously Ulbricht played a huge role but I'm still surprised to learn how big others were in the creation and operation of Silk Road, to the point where it seems like the site never would have lasted as long without, for instance, VJ to close some major security holes in 2011.
More on the subject: [The secret mentor of Silk Road's mastermind](
