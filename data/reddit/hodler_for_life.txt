I just got out, kinda had the same thing, but with a different bitcoin business. YOUR FUCKED SON! Seriously your lawyer wont have a clue, neither will the judge or jury, but they will lock you behind a cage like a fucking animal. FUCKING THUGS!!! GO AT IT ALONE! YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER SHOT THAN YOUR FUCK FACE LAWYER WILL! Its going to be hard you gotta get the jury to understand bitcoin. The fucking judge will try to stop you. DONT LET HIM! seriously just keep talking. He will tell the jury shit like "ignore, what he said" but you and I both know that people cant do that. 
Good luck wish you the best.

Attorneys dont know shit. Okay maybe they do, but they are part of the same system. They go out and get all chummy with the DA and judge, and dont give a shit about the client. They will tell you shit like "I got a good plea" Oh I'm sorry I didnt realize 1-3 behind a cage was a good deal!!!!!!!!! Maybe if the attorneys were advocates for the client this wouldnt happen but as it is, they are part of the same corrupt judically process bullshit!

Is anyone sick of the constant. "This is bad for bitcoin, this will death the ded bitcoin died" bullshit. We survived Gox (that was like a nuke in a downtown city). We had to roll back the blockchain once. Nothing is going to kill bitcoin, until the heat death of the universe, which should be delayed with all the ASICs running by then. :P

Why not both? Fucking deserves it in my book. Certainly better than Paul "I love dbet" Krugman, and miles in front of Obama Rama ding dong.

Its fucking battered wife syndrome. "Oh we didn't do X right so its our fault" Bullshit, you didn't do anything wrong, Paypal is the bad guy here.

I guess so, congress can no longer sit back and ignore bitcoin. They are going to be forced to accept it, its the will of the people, and for too long congress has forgotten that the will is what rules, not there corporate overlords

This post is so sweet it gave me the diabetus! Op is spot on


A long way is the understatement of the year. Bitcoin has turned on its boosters and the only people left questioning it are those who are pissed off they missed out on this glorious journey.

Im reminded of the saying from *men in tights* "you don't pay no tolls, we dont get no rolls". Gotta pony up man. Dont worry about increasing the fee a little bit. It helps keep the miners in business. Plus you can help the poor, they cant really afford it, so its basically charity.

SR is just as legit. People meeting to transact with other people, sounds like capitalism to me. Oh its not the right type of capitalism. The type that allows THEM to win, the type that allows THEM to profit. Oh now I see how we messed up.

Fuck Paypal, why should VOAT put up with this shit? Name me one other industry, in which you can shit on your customers and get away with it. This is like a customer eating a whole meal and then calling the manger over and slapping him in the face, and walking out without paying. Fuck paypal, eventually people will get sick of this shit, and realize that with bitcoin none of these problems will occur. I'm donating to VOAT with bitcoin, who is in? 
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:36:03
nah the old SR
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:54:30
The play on words isn't bad, but it does sound like something you catch after a night of banging prostitutes 
@_date: 2015-12-04 04:07:27


too long and not snappy enough. Why not just "Change the world" with a bitcoin symbol in there somewhere.  
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:19:02
Oh but i thought no one could sell off tons of bitcoins without crashing the price? So much for that talking point
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:48:46
Whats your conf? 
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:31:17


Thats why it will be so awesome once hes there
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:30:28
No,  that's the point. Tons of coins sold, price held relatively stable. This is a good thing
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:28:29
While it is awesome that a company is willing to assist with compliance, we shouldn't need it. Thats the ultimate irony 
@_date: 2015-05-14 01:55:26
Awesome. I don't know what a rails app is,  but good for you
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:03:52
This is good for bitcoin. People will see how expensive they used to be, and how relatively cheap they are right now, and then they will buy in. Its like apple stock, people didnt want it at 700, but then it became 100 and more people jumped in.

Ponzi? I think your teacher knows more about Fonzi than a Ponzi... Ya dun goofed

Moron slaves. They here something about bitcoins and the thinking part of the brain shuts down
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:35:24
Yes, yes, yes. Now if only I can get a hover board i can die happy

Good,  take away the power from the FED. Stop selling us to China

I'm so there. Whats the over under on getting roger ver to speak? Is he banned from Canada as well? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 03:24:57
Realistically, I say 1k easy
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:04:24


Gee stellar research fellas. See this is what happens something comes along that someone doesn't understand, and they ban it. Happened to ever important invention ever. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:14:38
Oh please, plenty of people accept bitcoin. This is nonsense, but you're probably right most people don't use bitcoin because most don't know about bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:25:32
I said maybe!  Its possible, it happened before. 1000 isn't really that far. With all the awesome bitcoin development happening now, its getting more and more attention 
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:30:16
Value is subjective, you assign value. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:09:22
Who knows. Realistically I would say much higher than now. Not 40k per coin, god no thats just ridiculous, but 1000? Maybe. Look at all the good news coming out. Nasdaq, new regs, etc...  This shows that the states know the status quo cant last and they are getting in now. Plus now that the block limit debate is behind us, we have less uncertainty. Good times

Ive never heard this ¿ what's wrong 
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:17:39
No man, its a damn plot, a coup, is what it is. NY is the supreme financial hub in the world. You didn't think those fat money cats were going to go down without a fight did you? Sucks the only people looking out for our freedom is the Chinese. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:56:51
Theymos is a freaking scam artist. We have needed this for a long time! Theymos, Starmaged, et al. Are all in control of bitcoin communication! This is not the way it should be! THESE CHANNELS ARE THE MOST IMPORTATNT LINK TO BITCOIN! THEY SHOULD BE FREE AND CLEAR OF UNDUE INFLUENCES FROM THE LIKES OF THOSE THAT WISH TO DO IT HARM! Someone needs to set up and new website, and a new sub, I will donate to help get it off the ground! CENSORSHIP IS BULLSHIT!!!! 
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:58:37
Yeah well I have called for a balanced budget oversight, but that doesnt look like its in the cards! DOWN WITH REGULATION!!! 
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:08:18
WHAT THE CUNTTING FUCK! OP PLEASE TELL ME YOU REMOVED THIS POST AND NOT THE BITCOIN CENSORSHIP BRIGADE!

What is the difference between greece and the Titanic? No one starved on the Titanic
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:14:05
Fucking right. If miners wanna get paid, they have to keep bitcoin chugging along. If they go against the will of the people, we can put them outta business. Unlike the Fed, the will of people rules bitcoin, not some Rothschild demon spawn.
