99% of people in the world are probably not thinking "I want bitcoin" right now.

Somebody find him!

This just in. We're pivoting ZapChain to become a decentralized ambition exchange.
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:02:39
I think he can be a powerful voice in the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:31:43
I guess you're doomed forever.
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:28:50
If you worked hard you could make a positive impact too.
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:35:48
You are the reason people hang out on ZapChain.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:30:49
This is crazy.
@_date: 2015-08-08 15:41:40
"No I didn't..."
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:09:28
You aint seen nothin yet!
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:56:58
I think the community + the media talking openly is a good start.

Founder/CEO/"Work for them" :)

This has been one of the coolest parts of ZapChain - the non bitcoin communities (like VR) who are now sending/receiving bitcoin tips on ZapChain and learning how it works / growing to appreciate it. 
We're just going to keep adding categories and keep bringing this same experience to as many people as possible.
@_date: 2015-07-29 01:23:13
Looking forward to this.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:24:45
We went through Boost VC (I literally started ZapChain day 1 of the Boost program. No code, no website, no registered company, no nothing).
We haven't announced additional funding...but...I will say that we're not going anywhere.
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:16:37
As an added bonus, if you ask a good VR question you will appear on the left side of UploadVR.com one of the largest VR publications in the world.

Hey Cuteman ;)
1) Typically a fund doesn't return a profit for a few years. 
2) The accountant would never have found it - you may not realize this but secretly Boost VC is working on an iron man suit and purchases like this happen all the time. I can't go into anymore detail on this.

Check out [ZapChain](

Ok - Jay-Z, on it. :)
No but really, on it.

Hey reddit!
I am the CEO / co-founder of ZapChain. Previously I was employee  at Ustream where I lead all social products, YC alum, and Forbes 30 under 30 for helping the music industry go viral online (most notably helping Lil Wayne).
Expect to see more artists, and celebs, using bitcoin in the future. This is only the beginning.
At ZapChain we have found that by combining content, and social interactions, with tiny amounts of money, you can increase engagement and quality of interaction. Instead of likes, or upvotes, people on ZapChain "tip" or "reward" each other with money. We have tested our community product for almost a year now with great success, with some communities getting over 100,000 people a month, and some members earning enough to buy school books and phone plans.
Now we are enabling everyone to use it. We believe there are a tremendous amount of people out there who can grow even more interesting communities than we can and we can't wait to see that happen. Apply to create your own community here: 
We've been working on this for a year and we are funded by Tim Draper &amp; Boost VC.

You can't earn bits with crap, only if you post good content.
@_date: 2015-11-21 01:33:23
We've noticed people actually try harder to post quality content when they know they could potentially get tips. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 01:36:31
We're definitely fascinated by the idea of a decentralized community platform, but at the moment we're just focused on making a product that has mass appeal today.
We can build decentralized functionality later.

Hey, Matt here (founder)! Send me an email at matt
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:28:32
Thanks for loving this! :)
Keep in mind that the average Talib fan doesn't have bitcoin or a wallet, but they do have a Twitter / Facebook account. That's why we did it this way.
Re the bug: Could you send me an email matt
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:41:29
Come join us on [ZapChain]( We have founders of bitcoin companies answering questions every day. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 06:33:22
Absolutely. Up until now we've been focused on getting the chore functionality of ZapChain up and running. Optimizing for mobile/tablets is a major focus of Q1 2016.
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:41:58
Yep, coming soon.
@_date: 2015-11-20 20:21:06
I added a few links to discussions and content on ZapChain so you could see examples.
I think stuff [like this]( and [this]( is really cool.

1. Making a crypto currency as successful as litecoin is impressive. He has a lot of unique insights because of this experience.
2. Charlie's ultimate goal is to make blockchain applications successful. Bitcoin has more adoption so he is focusing on that until it goes mainstream, once it goes mainstream he can spend time on litecoin.
3. Charlie works at Coinbase, the most funded bitcoin company in the world. This alone makes him a very interesting person to interview. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:50:42
I'm still collecting them :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:42:40
Ok, will do. Is there anyone specific you want me to get to answer that question? List of speakers &gt;&gt; 
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:57:18

It's ok, Brock Pierce was in Mighty Ducks.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:01:36
No, [I won a minion though!]( 
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:16:23
First video I have put together with answers from the conference! 
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:52:04
This is huge. Big congrats to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:52:55
Great question. Added to the list.
