I'm probably wrong but if I had to take a guess they probably hold bitcoins and convert them to fiat when needed, I believe the payments themself are not done through BTC (which would be quite impossible since not that many stores accept bitcoins yet, even there).

Honestly if I were a mod in this sub and saw this comment I would delete it. Conspiracy? No, just completly unrelevant and troll-like.
Same thing on the other subreddits. If you talk about unrelated stuff all the time why should you be allowed?

Good guide for beginners, something I always wondered is "is there anyway to autoselect the current sell/buy value?" I actually type it by hand everytime but site like bitfinex allow you to fill it just by selecting on of two buttons.
I know that selecting the graph on the price you want to sell/buy autofills the Limite price but that's just so unprecise

I'm conflicted, on one hand I know they are having thousands of support request everyday, on the other hand I had to open two request in 2 months and the answer have been borderline useless, waiting 1 week to have some generic suggestion that I already told carefuly in the description I had already applied was underwhelming.

Yes, the important thing is to get it off any exchanges or any wallet that won't let you have your private key.
I'd go with Electrum as a desktop wallet if you don't have much cash, otherwise paper/hardware wallet are the best choices

Banks and payment companies might try and fight it, but you'd be surprised on how many governments members actually invested in bitcoin and will try to make it rise.
Here in Italy several lead political figures clearly spoke about bitcoin and cryptocurrency as the unevitable future as a global currency, Matteo Renzi itself was very clear about it.

Honestly I feel like 50% of those are mine, while I tried to avoid the weekly limit on Coinbase (spoiler, I couldn't)

I'd love to understand why this happens, it cant be just fees right?

The podcast hints at the fact that if you buy BTC before the fork you're actually buying them on both chains, granted you have access to your private key.
If you buy or move BTC on one of those chain (let's say the one which will be valued less) you risk of loosing all your money, since after the fork the two coins will be different entities and even only moving them to an exchange that support only one of them you could have them "converted" in the "loosing" coin.
To put it simply: move your coins to a safe and private wallet, wait before moving them, see which "coin" will survive and after some days/week you'll be free to make your own choice.
Not to upset everyone, but I believe the stronger coin will be decided in hours, not days. Which of them I THINK will survive I will not tell not to anger anyone, but preferences aside you'll have both coins and will be able to decide.

I got my first bitcoin shortly after that, at the time I had not an opinion anyway. I'm not saying one is better than the other, I'm just saying "if I could choose, I'd go for replay protection".
All the "which fork is better" is nonsense for me (I understand it, I just have nothing to say about it!) :D

Exchange usually require your ID, plus most of them require debit and credit card to be protected by an additional security mesure (3dsecure for example).
I have to credit card, one sends an sms code to confirm the transaction the other doesn't. I had to apply the other one before I could buy bitcoin with that one.
Sadly, I believe that's something that's up to exchanges.

When I joined the bitcoin comunity 4 months ago I tried lot of exchanges, coinbase was the easiest to use, graphically appealing (giving you the impression you knew what to do) and the app was great aswell. When you start buying bitcoin you usually start with a little amount, and coinbase was one of the few exchanges to give you BTC immediately ready to be moved into your wallet (that was a good feeling for me).
Looking back I do not regret the 4% fee at all, sure it's not the most convenient way but it's a nice way for users to take their first step into BTCs! (Plus Gdax comes with it, but that's not something I knew back then).

I'm glad of the decision, whether or not I agree with SegWit2x replay attack protection is a must in every fork.

I only tried with Electrum desktop but yes, removing the portable or installed edition removes the password and let's you install it again with the same exact currency in any other computer.

If you actually earned something from that transaction I say good for you, no one could have known they would grow so much so quickly. Just look at those people who paid thousand of btc for pizza, 4chan access and that stuff.
~2000 dollard wouldn't have changed your life, you would have probably already spent those in things you didn't need! 
Don't let these things bring you down, if we all knew the future we'd all be rich. You could have invested in a dying cryptocurrency and lost much more.

I asked something very similar and got good replies here!

I don't see how this affects my personal opinion, not to mention I find Luke Dashjr a questionable man. As a BTC comunity member I just said that it makes no sense to me not to have replay protection, a tweet with no explanation whatsoever won't convince me, I'm willing to understand why it's good but so far nothing made me decide towards it. I'm not looking to argue but I would love to know more!
