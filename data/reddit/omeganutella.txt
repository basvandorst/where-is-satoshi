 Also helps that if those OG BTC ever moved it would collapse the whole market.

 All that crap to promote bitmax? 
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:13:12
100% agreed!

 Who even uses this anymore just install peazip or something

Anyone want to confirm this?
Note: I don't personally use Coinomi.

but what would that change? will you then blindly follow his vision and support BSV, or will you just be "satisfied"?
What i want to say is, why do you even care, you should support the "version" of Bitcoin you like most and think scales, regardless of who promotes it.
For me, i really like the idea of metanet and can understand the "datacenter" endgame. Its fine for me i like it, i dont really care if csw is satoshie or not. it would not change anything.
This whole debate is only about people and not about the tech, the Bitcoin space became a gossip show.
It should not be about who promotes best, or who do you like most, in the end it should be "what tech is best for miners, so they will continue to verify no matter what comes?" (thats just my opinion)

 0.25% per hop sounds absurdly expensive.

Should be archived forum posts then. Cypherpunks tend to be archivists often enough.
Could you produce these feuds?

because you think it's fueling the economy and creating jobs?
just imagine the extreme and you'll realize it's not the case if you actually have the sane assumption the economy is there to meet peoples needs and not the other way around.
If you have a inflation of 100% per day you'd be prone to spent your money immediately. Any purchase of choice would be better than holding cash. Means your marginal utility per $ spend will tend to go near zero, means you are wasting ressources (materials and most importantly human time). Inflation is only good for creditors and those who leverage their business with it.

 It's really not that complicated, there are simple custodial wallets that you can use like "wallet of satoshi" and "bluewallet". Lightning is super fast and fun to use. Raspberry pi is for those that want to run their own lightning node.

I get your point, but it increases the screen-to-body ratio which looks good on the specs.

 Those buying cryptos wont be gone, they will shift. Bank that is dying like DB might try buying btc and announce it to spike price up, and earn zillions of euro effectively rescuing itself from insolvency. It is very easy to pump BTC up and write profits in books, you just need to keep on buying BTC and price goes into infinity.

 No. The only real good explanation is that he worked for a company that likely would have claimed Bitcoin as Intellectual Property. For example, Google is a company that openly states that they likely have ownership claims against any side projects you work on even if you are just adding on to a personal project you worked on before your employment.

Not a bad thing, if you don't care about price and thus security, truly. Goddamn is this place a bubble or not? Being delisted from any rebuttable house would be a catastrophe in most places ... not here "wE'Re chAngIng the EconOmiC systEm wholEsale"

 I agree, almost stopped it because it's so crude, but glad I kept watching. Genius writing and comedy. I even felt sad when B cried.

 What do you mean? From my understanding of it, it doesn't allow for full recovery of channels, it only allows you to force close channels from the backup so that you get funds back.

I think it's still popular until though the site has gone through three different phases: Primedice, Primedice 2, and Primedice 3, with nearly 3 billion rolls through December 2014. While it may seem a bit underwhelming for a player to play at a site that only features one game, it is continually praised by players as one of the most enjoyable games involving Bitcoin. With a strong user base, and more players visiting regularly, Primedice may not only be the first, but also be the last Bitcoin gaming site to be online.

From what I know,  Silk Road was a .onion site that was sort of store for drugs. Primary method of purchase was crypto.
