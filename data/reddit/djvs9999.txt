This is so dumb.  You're comparing him publicly supporting a Bitcoin fork to government officials threatening to ban the entire system in order to game the market?
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:04:00
It's the intuitive solution.  Bitcoin is basically a sequential cryptographic ledger of transactions flowing at a given rate - you increase the rate to allow more transactions.  I've said it more than a few times, either you increase the rate, shrink the data stored, or don't store it on the blockchain at all (at least until you can shrink what you would have recorded).  It's not rocket science.  The big innovation behind LN and other L2 stuff is simply to record less stuff, which is cool but still requires more throughput than the network even allows for the system to be booted up on the scales we're talking about.  And since that there is a congestion problem *now*, while LN is *not* in production, and since we're not actually at a point where a significant block size increase would threaten the network, centralization-wise or otherwise, that means the prudent course of action is to increase block size.

Hash difficulty adjusts due to miner presence.  On Core that's every 2016 blocks, on Cash that's every single block.  So miner presence is more than anything else a product of relative mining profitability.   And fees are a consequence of block space being outstripped by demand, which has not happened with BCH with 8x the block size (not counting SW discounts), which is why the fees are like 400x higher on Core...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:40:07


It can increase bandwidth usage, sure.  Let's run that math though.  8mb block every 10 minutes, on an average connection let's call that 5 seconds.  So that's (60/5) * 10, 120 propagations per block for each node.  Are they syncing and raising like 80-100 other nodes every block?


See my other comments in thread ([example](  It's not necessary for all nodes to retain the blockchain tail indefinitely if you can simply reach network consensus as to the current UTXO state.


Let's reframe that.  Bitcoin is meant to be a global digital asset, a currency accessible to all.  *That won't work if you only allow 5 transactions a second to be recorded on its ledger,* even with fancy tricks like LN that can help simplify what state changes are recorded (the best thing they can hope to accomplish).  In the absence of actual demonstrable problems with increasing that limit to a specific number, it must be increased accordingly when a congestion ceiling is hit, or you start seeing "price gouging" on fees due to rising demand and static supply.  If you actually start hitting those problems, then yeah, you're forced to deal with the pricing of block space as a scarce commodity, but neither BTC or BCH is actually at that place.

I'll grant you quadratic hashing time.  Not storage costs though, storing the entire blockchain right now can be done on a 200gb HD from 2006 you find lying in the garbage.  And my claim was that a block size increase to 8mb doesn't create non-negligible centralization, not that centralization doesn't matter.

Block space flows at what's ostensibly a constant rate, something like 4-5 tx/s.  As soon as the on-chain transactions waiting for a block start appearing faster than that rate, miners are immediately incentivized to take the highest fee transactions, which starts a bidding war to get space on the chain (to have your transaction appear in a block and begin confirming).  This is basically the reason BCH increased the block size.  Hard to scale to have more transactions if you can't have more transactions.

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:31:25


First, I take issue with the claim that large blocks cause node centralization.  It's trivial to form consensus on a UTXO u at a given block height n, with block T, T(u_n) -&gt; T(u_n_plus_1) being the only transformation a validating "floating" node has to perform.  And with an 8mb block size, the maximum capacity is about 400gb/yr, which is an expense of about $100 every 10 years at current HD pricing (double that for a simple RAID).  
As for miner centralization - what is latency on a high speed connection for 8mb?  1 second, if even.  Versus 10mb time between blocks.  Nope.
edit: Oops - I mean T(u_n) -&gt; u_n_plus_1.

My experts on what should be called Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:23:22
Yes, sorry, that is, the mysterious presence who has admin control over github.com/bitcoin decided that their implementation wouldn't hard fork, despite the network being unable to meet demand for 6 months or to actually onload people onto the only major 2nd layer solution on the horizon.


I don't know what their deal is.  I know they refused a simple block size increase which the network could clearly tolerate, as it's in production implementation now without any serious miner centralization (actually having more hash power than BTC at one point).   And the network's congested and with skyrocketing fees, so you tell me.  I've been using it since 2011 and have never seen it this crippled.  It's obvious to me as a developer than you need a combination of on-chain and off-chain scaling, and likely something more radical like sharding or a DAG approach.  Hence I'm no longer keeping any money in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:21:52


It's not actually, check the dev updates.


It's storage space, CPU time and bandwidth.  Also, LTC's 2.5min block time is basically equivalent to 4mb blocks (with Segwit, so let's say 6-7mb for tx equivalency).   


Even Satoshi said, your average 10mbps connection user doesn't need to sync the transaction history of the planet (he was AFAIK the first one to mention light clients/SPV).  
There seem to be rampant misconceptions about what L2 can accomplish.  On top of the base layer of BTC, the best thing they can accomplish is reducibilty and non-immediate commitment of a state change.   So for an indefinitely recursive u_n = T1(T2(T3(T4[...](u_m)))), a summary transaction of the state changes from u_m to u_n, and/or a layer of transactions that haven't been committed to the chain.  I can't emphasize this enough.  LN and other L2 techs aren't magic, they can only simplify what gets committed and retain things in an uncommitted state.  Wild guess, maybe a 1/2-1/4x  relative  rate of increase for chain size.  So you need both on and off-chain scaling.
Of course this is L2 in the proper sense.  We're not even touching on issues like sharding, which again, are topics of investigation currently for BCH devs.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:38:24
Right, but the primary repo maintainers decided not to change it,  so here we are.


Not to get off subject, but yeah, what's the actual largest block that's been mined?  I ask cause the network looks pretty congested atm (119k unconfirmed transactions).  That 4mb number would require signatures to occupy about 3x the other block data, which is not usually the case.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:07:23
I think you're overstating how difficult it is to spin up new nodes with, what, 130gb of data?    And last I checked, BTC needs full nodes too.  It's not something inherent to BCH's protocol that there's a bunch of nodes on Alibaba hosting, looks like just a symptom of adoption being more prominent in China.


I do like this approach for any chain.  Less bloated.

@_date: 2017-12-07 01:39:52


Mmn, so the developers de-facto set fees by setting the block size limit and  constraining supply...well I do like your reasoning.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:51:22
It scales quite a bit.  The issue is that 1mb is an inappropriately low value - BTC is prioritizing the very unimportant time to do a full sync over its core value proposition, which is to act as a decentralized payment network.  8MB or even 100MB+ blocks don't seem to pose any significant risk to centralization, they simply allow more actual transactions to be recorded.  When you start running into issues like blocks being too big for other miners to get before the last block's miner mines a new block, sure, they're too big.  But one block every ten minutes, versus the download time for 8mb?  No way.  That's not even a single second on my home connection.
When you actually hit the limits of that basic, non-invasive, non-protocol-changing scaling method, then it's appropriate to discuss protocol changes to facilitate L2 stuff (assuming the proposals have a good value proposition).  If they're worth the tradeoff before then, sure.  But that's not what's happening.  BTC core is currently incapable of scaling and a simple constant tweak on a fork lets it scale for the foreseeable future, at the oh-so-horrible cost of increasing the amount of storage to record the entire history of transactions for a currency (currently costing, uh, $40, $50 total? What is that, 2-3 transaction fees now?).  And if you want to talk about long, long term scaling - the blockchain increases *infinitely*.  You have to cut off the chain and form a consensus system as to the current UTXO state eventually, with something like btree+DHT for storing the then-unused legacy chain.  I've been describing this like functional reactive programming - replayable transformations T(s1) -&gt; s2 that transform one state into another.  If you know s2 is valid, you don't need to know s1.  Each block is an instance of T, transforming UTXO state.  If there's network consensus on UTXO state at block height h (obtainable through hash + statistical sampling), you can just download that.  Not as strong a security model as everyone being a fully validating node, by a sliver, but that's what scaling is like, you make tradeoffs based on pros and cons.
The really important point to get - the blocks just contain transaction data.  Saying we want to limit the block size to X is just saying, we're only going to allow this many transactions per block (given consistent tx size).  You can't get around that issue.  You can find ways to avoid committing transactions, or merging transactions, stuff like that, but those are just little optimizations - the network is still rate limited.    The unresolved question is, how much do we value having more transactions vs. the technical risks and limitations?  Right now things are grossly imbalanced in favor of limiting transactions.  It has not been shown that 8 or 16 or w/e MB is a risk, there's a multibillion dollar blockchain operating just fine on that premise, but it has been conclusively shown that 1mb right now is causing the equivalent of fee price gouging because of static supply and growing demand for the scarce commodity of space on a block.

@_date: 2017-12-20 19:41:08

No, Segwit is stripping the witness data, moving it to a new data structure, and not counting it towards the block size.  You can achieve something like 1.7x-2x increase in tx's with it, and it's not doing the trick right now.  Hard block size increases (S2X and BCH) were met with extreme hostility and resistance that's ongoing.

Takes only a few hours to download that amount with a checksum, like over BitTorrent.  See above re: consensus/checksum validation of past blockchain.  The time+resources to download and validate any chain just grows infinitely if you don't "take it for granted" at some given blockheight.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:49
At the 1mb point around July/August, it was not appropriate to put off a block size increase until LN deployment, which still hasn't happened on December 21st (and *cannot* cover the network for months to years due to the requirement of each user opening multiple payment channels).  Congestion started hitting hard back around May, when average block size ran into the 1mb limit.   
There is a runaway congestion problem on the Core chain, with average fees spiking dramatically up to about $40 today, and the mempool hasn't been cleared for a *month*.  The damage caused by putting off a blocksize increase is substantially worse than anything avoided by  not raising it to 8mb or so.
LN is also experimental.  1-&gt;8mb block size increase is guaranteed to result in an 8x capacity increase (give or take some small amount from 'externalities'), while LN's performance improvement for actual economic usage hasn't been established.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:09:39
I've spun up a full node like, 8 times?  I know it takes forever.  It doesn't have to.  And on the note of culled chains - there's no reason this couldn't be user configurable and also it seems to be it'd be quite secure with as small a history as 8-24 blocks.  Remember you're relying on the entire network's consensus and verification, you can poll a hundred or a thousand nodes for the hashes of a given subset, just like with BitTorrent.  It's a nifty trick.

You've been conflating full nodes and miners through this whole thread.  Miners have technologies like FIBRE (and some thin block technology IIRC) for rapid block propagation which minimizes block propagation latency, and they also tend to have significantly higher connections (can't give you a stat but it's pretty obvious anyone investing &gt; $10,000/mo in mining isn't going to skimp on an internet connection and risk mining invalid blocks).  OP's post wasn't even about miners in the first place, full node latency is a totally different issue.

Rolled my eyes so hard at the word "suspect".  OK dude.
First, I'm not arguing against the fundamentals of Bitcoin.  Second, Satoshi himself said full nodes just have to be prolific enough for network stability, not every user having one.  Bitcoin's use case is as a currency, which is used to *buy stuff*, not speculate on changes in value relative to fiat, which is what most people seem to be using it for - the same people whose demand made it skyrocket like that (as anyone can see from the homepage of this sub on a given day).  Bitcoins are just a useless, expensive piece of real estate on the moon if you can't actually use it to transfer value as a currency, that's the most fundamental thing.

I should say, full node centralization isn't the worst centralization threat.  Without a mining majority, all they can do is relay invalid blocks.


Seems like a lot of people are claiming that, as people around here are constantly saying things like "bcash centralized chinese shitcoin".  And Andreas when talking about BCH constantly starts talking about terabyte and petabyte blocks - why?

No, there aren't.  The  claimed reason is miner decentralization, which clearly isn't a problem because at one point BCH had more mining power than BTC, and for the more obvious reason that downloading 8mb doesn't take a hundredth of the time it takes to generate a block, leaving the miner of the last block with essentially no advantage.  The  claimed reason is keeping the blockchain sized down, which is meaningless because the UTXO is the only metric that has to be maintained by most nodes.  The  claimed reason is the keep the UTXO set size down, which is meaningless because it's already incentivized by transaction fees and could be further incentivized in a billion ways that don't require restricting the capacity of the network.  All the arguments are bunk and counterintuitive to the obvious stated goal of Bitcoin, which is an ongoing transaction/balance ledger to cover the entire world economy.  There is an argument for limiting block size to the extent that it *actually* comes at a cost greater than increasing it, with alternatives exhausted, but until then. it should be increased.

No reason you can specify the depth of retention - could be a thousand blocks back.


Just sha256'ed a 13mb file (CPU).  0.08s, so 0.16s for a double.  Latency from China to U.S., well, they set up a great firewall, they could choke it to 1kbps if they wanted (and you can certainly achieve decent speeds).  Is that really an excuse to degrade the Bitcoin network, that latency over a massive packet inspecting firewall might make a block take an extra 5-10s to propagate into China?

You said you weren't interested in hearing the opinion of people who copy and paste code and change constants, well guess what, that's pretty much what they've been doing since Satoshi left, as evidenced by a critical fee and congestion problem and crisis of legitimacy for the currency.

I've set up a node more times than I can remember, admittedly I didn't sit there each time dividing the time to complete over the block height.   But I'll do that right now.  We're at height 500,000, and it takes on average about 3 days to sync a node right now, right?  A bit lower now I think, even.  So that's 259200 seconds, or 2 blocks (2mb) per second.   Those UTXO lookups are stored in memory IIRC, or at least btree or similar on the filesystem, so not very expensive.  Really doesn't change my point much.


Yes, well that is a chunk of the reason there's low bandwidth between the U.S. and China, the other big reason being China's crummy ISPs.   This kind of gets into the sharding conversation, but I'll leave it there.

S2X and BCH were two completely different forks.  It was one guy who started BTC too, some degree of centralization of developers is almost impossible to avoid, but doesn't really matter much in an open source project.  The only real issue of substance is which protocol and client implementations work better - and Ver isn't even "at the helm", there are several client implementations of BCH, same as BTC (as you'd expect, since they share most of the same codebase).
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:59:43
UAHF was [proposed by Bitmain]( and first implemented as BitcoinABC by I'm not even clear what Ver has to do with it besides being a vocal supporter and the mod of 2 months ago I remember he wasn't even all in.  It's literally just 2015 Bitcoin with a new difficulty algorithm (the 2nd iteration) and 8mb block size limit.
IDK what's going on with GDAX, they gave me a startle this morning.  Although not as bad as noticing my crypto dropped 30% in value.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:56:41
First, BCH came months before S2X, second, pretty sure he stated planned adoption of BCH a long time ago, third, BCH has had majority hash power compared to BTC before, so clearly not that centralized, fourth, I don't know what you're talking about re: BCH fees being manipulated (they are very low), and fifth, no, the same traffic on BCH would not produce the same issues BTC has, that is the entire point of increasing the block size.  You seem very confused about a lot of stuff here.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:54:10
That's pretty much all the Core devs, lmao.  None of them even developed the software dude.  Deadalnix IIRC actually came up with the new DAA for BCH, which is actually a lot better than Satoshi's.  Half the changes Core made were garbage like RBF or Segwit (a hard fork trying to pretend to be a soft fork).  They did like, some database optimization recently, that was nice.

subscriber here, I actually do not care and wouldn't waste my time on that.   I also have the facts from the handful of convos I've had about this, and know average fees on BTC chain are floating at around $7-8 right now, while they're somewhere in the low cents for BCH.   So...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:32
You realize to fill blocks they would have to spend money *on* fees?  Otherwise their transactions would be less attractive than transactions *with* fees to any other miner.  That's an unstable equilibrium - any conclusive evidence of that ever actually happening?

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:56:51
Seen it and disagree.  Block size increase = transaction capacity increase, full stop.  The blockchain is just a chain of linked transactions - if you want to add more, you have to have the capacity to add more.  The only thing Lightning and similar can do is find clever ways to reduce the # of transactions that end up on the chain (not to downplay that this can help).  And I've found Andreas's usual reasoning to be a slippery slope fallacy - that 8mb is a bad idea because 1gb or 10gb blocks would cause centralization (which is honestly debatable, I reckon there are some clever tricks you can use to safely scale up to huge blocks).
Full node centralization (as in OP here) isn't a decent marker of centralization BTW.  Miner centralization is the real concern, which honestly only seems to emerge as an issue with BCH because of variance in mining profitability and miners switching between chains.  And seriously - Alibaba has cloud hosting, just like AWS EC2 etc., is it really surprising a country with a billion people has a bunch of full nodes running on a popular cloud provider?

Full nodes just relay blocks.  Altered blocks are invalidated by other full nodes.  The only threat is to SPV wallets, which last I checked no one around here even cared about, and (forgive me for not having brushed up on SPV) I assume checks a couple nodes for current state.  Creating malevolent yet "valid" blocks that don't result in an orphaned chain requires a 51% attack.


Well, a bunch of people agreed on 8mb, and have a working crypto which just shot up to 25% of BTC market cap, so.  Segwit isn't being ignored, BCH forked from pre-SW code on purpose out of not wanting to use it, and used on-chain scaling for the time being, while BTC has activated it with relatively low user adoption.  And there isn't some sudden magical transaction increase, you can look at graphs of actual block size over time and see a clear linear increase from ~2011.

Personally I moved BTC-&gt;BCH at the 0.05 point because I perceived BCH as relatively undervalued, and then I made money off of it.  The market movements long, long term have plenty to do with the project fundamentals and which is better, but blaming anyone but yourself for buying in at the peak of a wave of trader FOMO in a little 24 hour trading window is just stupid.

It's gonna be very hard to put the trade history of a currency on a frigging consumer hard drive.  But that's how blockchains work.  Only ways to scale that besides some neat tricks about abbreviating the history are to either share the load or to start forgetting the past as time moves forward.

But don't take my word for it.  Let's see what the [Segwit BIP]( says.










So the block size is still 1,000,000.   Wow, fascinating.

Assuming by "deflation" you mean price deflation - that's not permanent.  It just means that while the market is correcting for the existence of the currency, it's owners (typically) see a larger benefit in holding it.  Both options are (generally, with the exception of people who went short and lost money due to holding it in a decreasing-price period) superior to it not existing at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:24:59
That's true.  Not sure how that will compare against price inflation with the sort of value-added economic growth we'll be looking at when &amp; if cryptocurrency becomes the primary type of currency.  But if so, it will probably spur adoption in other cc's that have inflation baked into the protocol, like Ethereum or whatever.  Since a hard fork of BTC to introduce inflation is probably impossible.

The market's gonna decide on the best solution.  It'd be ideal for the market player with primary adoption to make the best set of choices technologically, but if it doesn't happen, the market will eventually migrate to whoever does.

I see where you're going with this, but there's a fine point - the second layer would allow consensus on the first layer to be established, and then it could be discarded after the first layer was committed to the blockchain.  It just lets you say, "OK, we've all seen and witnessed what went down", and have a stable reference for that until the issue of malleability is gone because the transaction is committed.

You could say all that in reverse about Blockstream and Segwit.  The technology's completely different, has major drawbacks, and their $70m business model is predicated on L2 solutions.
BCH works fine, I've been moving it around for months.  Anyone can mine a block, and half the miners have.   Plus it's got plenty of transaction capacity. Not sure what everyone thinks is so illicit about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:13:15
The inflation from EDA is over, it's been stabilizing at a block every 10 minutes.  Wasn't much of a jump in the big picture.  And re: fork - the fork was what's called "non-contentious", e.g. no one actually  cares about the old chain, so it doesn't really matter if a few blocks are mined on it.
The big picture is which chain has the best future prospects.  Believe it or not, it may not be clear cut BTC, because transaction malleability fix without Segwit is certainly possible, which would leave BCH a distinct capacity edge - and 8mb wasn't a tenth of the centralization/etc. problem people think.

Better idea.  See what different developers have to offer, educate yourself on the topic, and make the decision yourself.  
"Let the Windows developers decide!"  was (and still is) a thing.  People totally unfamiliar with the space assume Microsoft is the cutting edge, best option for computers in general.  As a developer, I know better, and it's Linux or BSD pretty much for everything in my life besides dealing with other people's systems.  Mac OS X gets a little pass, being vaguely based on a BSD kernel, but not really.  Blind trust would get me a closed-source system full of security holes, shitty OS APIs, and viruses. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:38:35
It actually sounds better than what a lot of exchanges do, which is to tell you to get bent if you send BCH to a BTC, or ETC to an ETH, address.  Additionally it sounds like the only risk is if you manage to *send* BCH to a BTC address (*or vice versa), which is...well, a separate UI problem.  I am of course assuming the wallets share keys.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:41:49
It's not radically different, it's just signature checking for the original witness data so that you can be sure it's the agreed upon version pre-"consensus".  And the original witness data is still non-segregated.
For the general case of 1 &lt; t &lt; n...mmn...think that requires a deeper rework.  You'll forgive me if I don't have an answer off the top of my head.

Technically, that is what it is about.  The politics are another story, and apparently leave quite a bit to interpretation.

@_date: 2017-11-16 23:15:00
The issue is whether or not the witness data is in the merkle tree.  From what I understand Segwit removes (segregates) it and puts it in the coinbase "message" instead as a hash, so then miners can potentially skip downloading and verifying it without downloading until a catastrophic failure.    Not really sure what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:23:04
If you manage to command non-negligible value for your fork, sure.  Rule of thumb, if they're worth over $5 each or so, then yeah, if you're an exchange then grab your private keys, check the balances, sell it all, put it in a fund and credit your users proportionally for it based on their holdings at fork time.  The reason they do this instead of enabling trading is because it's way easier.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:41:24
Looks like it does? [Check this out](  Needs a fork, but looks nicer than Segwit.
Block size increase needed to be done before the chain hit congestion.  That's why you're seeing a market movement.  The theories of BTC manipulation are getting really ridiculous, reminds me of Mao's campaign against sparrows (although most things in my life do).

Miners incur costs by mining, and BTC and BCH have various systems designed to reward miners (not too much, not too little) for mining blocks, while keeping blocks going as close to a constant schedule of 1 block per 10 minutes as possible.  It's designed to dynamically adjust to price and usage for the currency over time.  But the town isn't big enough for both currencies, so now they're having an automatic war, which will eventually turn into a robot battle fueled apocalypse reminiscent of "Terminator" and "The Matrix".

BCH sat at 300 for a month or three, then blew up to 2800, crashed, and stabilized (so far) at 1250 over about 2-3 weeks.   That's in an established market with uncertainty about which tech's going to take the throne.  Note that roughly the same thing happened when it came into existence back in August, but with a peak under 1000, and a short-term stabilization at something like 600 (sorry, going from memory).

BCH isn't run by anyone any more than BTC is.  It's a cryptocurrency with a consensus protocol and some reference implementations.  Ver runs and promotes BCH, and probably got a truckload of free money when the fork happened, but so did every other whale.  If you think a block size capacity upgrade is necessary, well, there's a coin with one, do you have an actual non-hand-wavy reason not to use it?   Keeping in mind the L2 prospects actually seem to be better, cause BCH chain can do malleability fixes without having to deal with legacy Segwit, which was not a very pretty change.

My scheme retains witness data and piles on a second layer to ensure non-malleability.  The Segwit scheme segregates witness data as its second layer.  The witness data could be discarded in SW, but not in my scheme, where only the secondary witness data could be discarded.  The potential invalidity would only extend to an invalid block ID and the likelihood of that would decrease exponentially (?) with every additional block layered on top of it, requiring something similar in essence to a 51% attack.  I'm not saying dropping the secondary witness data would be encoded in the protocol or anything, just that there are limits to its usefulness, as some have posited about Segwit meaning witness data could be pruned if it was buried enough (you've read that too, right?).

Great, so then anything that eliminates script/signatures from txid (SW/FT/etc.), anything that repairs signature/script malleability at the source (including eliminating unnecessary variability in scripts, see above 'declarative/functional' comment, and maybe including changing sig algorithm to ensure determinism), or anything that reliably extracts a confirmation of which txid is to be used (various network/protocol schemes come to mind).   


It's network/CPU overhead (not really disk space, as they can be safely deleted after some short length of time), but with the benefit that the txid manages to cover witness data reliably.  Cost-benefit analysis, this is just an example of a trivial solution for that case.

Basically a linear increase until May/June this year, when (*it hits the 1mb limit and) people started exiting towards alts.  If you follow the best fit line, the average would be going around 1.18 right now.  But it hit the 1mb limit, and has only inched up to 1.05 with some SW adoption.
So no, doesn't look like spam, looks like congestion.

It's the way you said it - "automatically cedes control of the Bitcoin codebase and Git repo" - that's not how it works.  All the fork does is implement new consensus rules - anyone can create a client implementing those consensus rules, just like anyone can create a browser implementing HTTP(S).   is still controlled by the Core team and will continue to be (unless they give it away or shut it down willingly), and they're free to update their implementation to support 2x (or indeed both 1x and 2x, which would be nice), they just don't want to.  There's nothing in the consensus rules that says "you have to be using  or, "this software has to be signed by jgarzik", it just specifies a 2MB block weight limit.

It's subjective in how you choose to define "Bitcoin".  Bitcoin Cash is almost identical to ~2015 Bitcoin, the changes being to difficulty adjustment and block size consensus rules - you could probably produce a BCH compatible client changing less than 40 lines of bitcoin-core from then.  Segwit is a huge change that revises the definition of the Bitcoin blockchain, seeing a few hundred or thousand lines of code changed.  Despite being the implementation ostensibly compatible with past consensus rules, I'd characterize it as a different technology, with BCH being more like a parameters tweak.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:14:55
The issue is whether or not the witness data is in the merkle tree.  From what I understand Segwit removes (segregates) it and puts it in the coinbase "message" instead as a hash, so then miners can potentially skip downloading and verifying it without downloading until a catastrophic failure.

Right.  You changed the topic to this multisig wallet issue citing the necessity of Segwit.  I demonstrated an alternate solution for that case - a signed consensus from each party as to the signatures of the other parties.  And you reply with this?
txid is a "proof".  It's a collision resistant hash.  And it's a nice-to-have for it to be a single source of truth, covering the entirety of data in a transaction, and solutions to the sources of malleability ideally should be exhausted first before that pattern is discarded.  Sorry this makes you so upset.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:29:01
The "cast of characters" is irrelevant.  We're talking about decentralized cryptocurrencies.  The only point that matters is the pros and cons of the separate chains weighed against each other.   There's a whole narrative here, and there's another whole narrative in whatever - what this boils down to is one chain with 1mb blocks, 2016 block DA, Segwit, a bunch of stuff on its roadmap (MAST, LN, Schnorr, etc.), and another chain with 8mb blocks, 1 block DA, and a bunch of stuff on its roadmap (TMF for MASt/Scnorr/LN/etc., sharding, etc.).

Well, it seems to have quite low capacity improvement, while not the only transaction malleability fix, so I wouldn't agree it's "necessary", which brings us to the issue of its security - 


This is the issue - they're not *forced* to check signatures, now it's speculation about risk and incentives.  They can get away with not checking signatures, which can eventually culminate in a much lower threshold for a 51% attack based on how many miners weren't bothering.   That can result in a chain split - I'm still looking into whether or not it's even a recoverable one.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:26:55

@_date: 2017-11-20 19:14:17
How does it not work and not fix malleability?    All the multisig wallet signatories sign off on the signatures used to create the txid.  You have a stable reference for the transaction agreed upon by all parties.

I really haven't seen any of this substantiated, and most of it conflicts with my expectations technically.  The download time for a mining operation to get 8mb (~2 seconds?) versus the target block time of 10 minutes, not seeing the centralization threat.  Disk space?  Don't even link me to an Andreas A. video.  They all seem spurious.  Correct me if there's another concern.
Now Bitcoin Core, where fees start increasing exponentially every time the mempool is full - miners actually get those fees.  I think the average was $6 a transaction about a week ago - that's (7 * 60 * 10 * $6 ) $25,200 in fees per block.  BCH scales up a little less than 8 times that amount before the fees behave like that.   Then if you made the argument they want to keep TXs on-chain instead of LN or similar - well LN is possible on BCH, as there are various non-SW TM fixes around if there's demand for it (or technically even Segwit, if one were so inclined).  Then the same principle still applies, even with onboarding LN transactions there's 1/8 the capacity before that type of sharp fee increase.  
I think Core hasn't really shown that centralization is a threat with an 8MB block size.  I'm more  concerned about allegations of Blockstream limiting blocksize to furtheir their stated off-chain business goals.

Right.  When BTC/BCH ratio is going up, it's the market rejecting an evil crypto.  When BCH/BTC ratio is doubling and tripling, from 0.05 to 0.1 and now like 0.18 of BTC, it's an orchestrated scam to give the illusion of demand.  Nothing to do with a crypto with an average $6 fee right now, and the only block size increase fork vanishing, being unusable for small-scale online commerce.
I'm not partial to either coin.  I've been in BTC since 2011/2012.  But it's obvious to me the market is just gonna go with what works now.  I've done PCI compliance and payment gateway hookups for businesses maybe a dozen times now, and guess what, they want the credit card processor that charges the least, and certainly don't want 6-48 hour congestion delays.

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:35:53
This is the big error I keep seeing around here.  BCH is a blank canvas, but BTC has Segwit now and forever, basically.  Second layer solutions on top of BCH may require a fork for malleability, but no one cares as long as it's not a potential threat to the security model a la Segwit.  So we're looking at two chains, one with one about 2-5x capacity the other, and one with currently implemented malleability fix, at the cost of the guarantee that miners will validate witness data.   The calculations for TPS should be based on either mean/median current capacity or an inclusive and reasonable view of future capacity.  Saying the Core chain supports a bajillion TPS based on projections of LN isn't very honest.

They were consensus rules (in the truest sense) until the consensus broke and a ton of people forked to a new coin.  Ethereum Classic is also an example of retained consensus rules, but Ethereum's creator abandoned that chain due to an outcome the community didn't like.  Avoiding hard forks isn't any kind of badge of honor, long-term you want to end up with the best software.

(a) Let us know when you figure out an Ethereum exploit.  (b) No, it doesn't.  Monero, ZCash, Dash, and (gasp) Ethereum  all have better security models.  If you ignore some possible faults, even IOTA (quantum-resistant encryption). Only serious advantage BTC has is hash rate from its first mover advantage - it's the MySpace of crypto, hate to say it, with a stubborn dev team that refuses to hard fork to improve *anything*.  Ethereum hard forks when it has to, and its technology is better than BTC's by leaps and bounds - only consequence of those forks being one minority chain with just about zero development.
And re: OP - all these currencies are Bitcoin variants and have forked (soft or hard) from the original, playing favorites for the name is childish and out of anyone's control.  All this talk about BCH trying to confuse people is nonsense, its main community (explains the difference constantly.

First, arthroscopy is through an incision.  The idea is to cause as little damage as possible.
Choosing different k, secret key?  I'm out of the loop on how multisig is being implemented, but can't you just have each signatory sign each other's private keys in a roundabout layering to establish which keys are being used, which reduces the viability of the attack you mentioned to the collision likelihood of the algorithm?
The opposition to SW is partly because of the data structure change (re: how it alters economic incentives), but also the soft fork maneuvering, the politics of holding off a block size increase with SW as the de facto replacement, the fact that it introduces technical debt forever, etc.. And it doesn't sound like the worst idea to have a txid hashing *all* of the information in a transaction, either - the signature data is after all an essential proof of the validity of a transaction.  You can imagine why people would want to have it guaranteed to remain intact.

Well, the energy usage is basically a function of total hashrate...which I think really only changes significantly in relation to total demand for Bitcoin (all variants included, with their somewhat-fixed supply)...so the question probably boils down to the influence of the algorithm on price...so if it improves the performance of the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, generating popular demand, it would use significantly more energy as a result.
Unfortunately, the energy efficiency of PoW systems leaves a lot to be desired (usage actually increases as the systems scale), that's part of why there's a lot of research into PoS lately.

Not accounting for Segwit, BCH has 8x the transaction capacity.  Overly generously accounting for Segwit, 2x.   Just the facts.    If a coin works better, expect the valuation to reflect that, and expect miners to follow mining profitability, which is a function of price and difficulty.  Core chain's maintainers pretty much refuse to HF over anything, so looks like it's gonna be  stuck with a 2016 block DAA while BCH has a block-by-block DAA.  You can draw your own conclusions about the outlook there.

Besides that a reference to a transaction can be guaranteed to pertain to a specific instance of witness data?  I admit I haven't thought through every possible scenario, but that certainly seems like a useful guarantee.  Then there's the side issue of witness data being omitted reducing network security by introducing a new potential class of non-full-node, and potentially making it more economical for miners to ignore witness data entirely...




Segwit is not the only change that resolves TM, it's not even the only change that removes witness data from txid hash.  There are certainly issues with disadvantages of SW as a soft fork as opposed to a hard fork, which remain even if you concede the usefulness of omitting witness data from the txid.

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:18:33
A hard fork means the protocol adopts new, non-backwards-compatible consensus rules.  I think the term "chain split" may only apply if both the new and old consensus rules continue accruing blocks.  A chain split may also occur with compatible consensus rules but miners building upon different series of blocks (which is disincentivized by the mining rewards + tx fees being rendered worthless on the opposing chain - see 51% attack).
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:44:19
It wasn't "spam" because it was the same commodity for the 5 years this block size increase was under debate.  Now that the blockchain split over it and it's a new commodity, it's suddenly "spam" the second you disagree with anything in Core repo in favor of BCH approach (but we can discuss basically any other crypto in existence).  
The thing this keeps reminding me of is Maoism.  Crop failures getting blamed on the West = congestion and hashrate loss getting blamed on BCH as an "attack".  Exiles, purges etc. = hegemony about who can discuss what and what opinions are acceptable, as if they come from "the people", but just come down from on high (Greg, Luke, Andreas etc. say something, it's gospel) = Mao's "Little Red Book".   BCH's price spikes, it's a "pump and dump" although no one seems to be able to prove it.
The one thing nobody seems to discuss is the technicals.  Everyone's constantly talking about LN as the fix-all solution, but it's not here, there's congestion and high fees now, blocksize increases up to a far limit are safe, but it's topic-non-grata to have any fork whatsoever to change it.  That's seriously bizarre to me.
And the worst of it?  This whole "which is the real Bitcoin" thing.  Satoshi can't weigh in, a popularity contest or control over the core repo is a ridiculous measure - if you go by similarities of the protocol, it's BCH.  But you guys insist it's BTC like gospel, even with the fundamental change of Segwit.  Why?

I've done my share of declarative/functional programming and have a pretty good sense that you could require a signature "script"  to follow one of several "most reduced" patterns in a hard fork in the case of a non-Turing-complete DSL, and implement a parser to prove the correctness and pattern-following of that script.  You say it yourself, "short of doing something [awful?] like eliminating script and DL signatures".  Maybe the fundamentals behind Script should be revisited.  In any case, if the script or signature are the sources of malleability, therein lies the problem.

Wow, yeah, I took a deeper look at Flexible Transactions.  Let's see, point by point.  (a) I don't care if X plagiarized Y or Y plagiarized Z.  Tech is the issue.  (b) "Outdated and surpassed" [...] - *really?*  It seems like quite the forward-looking plan which is NOT surpassed now, namely moving to a key/value data structure, and this is something I've implemented hundreds of times on APIs, as in those cases (and similarly here), there's is fantastic benefit to having a layer of abstraction allowing you to specify arbitrary keys, namely in that you don't have to revise the contract between client/server (or format and parser) every single time you change anything.  (c) Bugs - dude, I do not care if a single implementation of it had bugs, there is nothing inherently buggy, *period*, about parsing a binary key-value store (d) Statistics - I'd like to see a source for this, but even if it's less performant CPU and network wise, or even disk space wise (which would surprise me), it'd almost definitely be worth it for the flexibility it'd afford the protocol.  And (e) re: malleability (which I assume you're getting at re: "nothing to do with SegWit") - it is one of the modifications, in his sample formatting, which removes signature data from the txid, meaning it would remove malleability.

If that were the case, I doubt there would be consistently full blocks  at all, the network would have at least forked to a different scaling model ~6 months ago when that started (eg a miner consensus limit with a hard limit a little ways up).  Not to even touch on some other telltale signs which aren't welcome discussion around here.

It was announced two weeks ahead of time with details, everyone agreed it was a good idea because the EDA was too unstable, and nobody assigns any value to the old version, so for the most part no one is mining it.  IDK what you guys are talking about, you don't seem to know the story.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:23:18
Yeah maybe, but he jacked my idea.  It actually applied when I did it.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:53:59


the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.
All EDA does is tighten the process by specifying an "emergency" 20% reduction for each block for which there are &lt; 6 blocks in the last 12 hours.   It's not a huge change, it's just causing oscillatory behavior because of how the market prices for BTC and BCH landed, causing them to compete to be the most profitable chain to mine.  Honestly, it makes a lot more sense than BTC's simple "reevaluate the difficulty every 2016 blocks" mechanism, but it had a real bumpy landing, messing with both chains a bit.
If it was an issue of "each chain is pegged to the difficulty of all other chains", minority/lower-value forks would be impossible.  That wouldn't be a good idea at all - sometimes good ideas take a while to catch on.

@_date: 2017-11-01 02:42:04
In case you didn't get what I just said, normal difficulty adjustment already does that, just a lot more slowly (2 weeks).  The slowness wasn't really an issue pre-BCH, since it was the first notable fork, but since it did enter into direct competition as a nascent entry into the market, it needed to rapidly adjust difficulty based on highly volatile price.  It's a certainty Satoshi understood the idea of incompatible forks with different difficulty, ultimately the market sorts out the relative value of each long-term, and difficulty adjustments just make sure each chain is viable.

Yes, so they'd probably be stored in memory for 20 blocks or something.  But again, the first layer signatures are the only ones that are persisted, the second layer ones are just used to promote a stable reference until there's some sufficient amount of consensus as to what the first layer ones were.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:55:04
I understood TM as an issue of *peers* modifying the signatures 
- in that case it sounds like the transaction spender(s) could simply sign the txid, which would eliminate malleability initiated by peers.  I'd have to think about malleability coming from Alice, but is that even an attack vector?

I'll admit I had to go verify it was the header of the block that gets hashed, and what the transaction/witness data structure looks like. But on doing so I verified it removes the burden from miners to validate the transactions they mine, as the actual unhashed witness data isn't required to compute their block's hashMerkleRoot, they can simply receive the transactions with signature hash alone and just assume it's valid.  Thanks for being civil and helpful. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:45:21
Segwit alters Bitcoin to no longer ensure that miners validate witness data, which actually breaks the definition of Bitcoin.  2016 blocks (exactly 14 days at avg. rate) and 1mb were round numbers Satoshi pulled out of his ass, not metrics he intended to be forever unchanged.

You seriously write this huge, disrespectful reply and gloss over this key point? 
Your question is, what's wrong with eliminating the requirement of cryptographic proof of financial transactions being kept intact, let's just hash it and store it somewhere else, to saves us the trouble of having to have a public, established agreement of which signatures were used in a multisig wallet?   The point of a "roundabout layering" is to establish which keys were used, if you simply require the parties to demonstrate consent to it - then you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

A non-centrally planned, free economy based on people doing things for the sake of doing them.  You seem to have forgotten my original point.


Ah, so now it sounds like they didn't have a choice.




Again, you seem to have lost track of what we were talking about.
The point is that we're currently based on an economic model where people are given some kind of token of value in exchange for work, such that they can redeem that token for future work, and that this model is ultimately based on a very dismal idea of human potential (which you seem to share).  You immediately jump to the example of "no one would do jobs X and Y", but this demand in and of itself represents a human need, which there is some drive to fill, whether the "compensation" is monetary or just the satisfaction of having filled that need.  It is a lower level of human interaction, where both the expectation exists that someone will not work without being paid, and where someone will need to be paid to work - it represents a failure of a functioning community based on autonomous contribution.
If that point is lost on you, and you need to jump to the assumption that autonomous participation without the expectation of payment can only occur based on central planning, I don't know what to tell you.  I did my job explaining it, I can't do your job of understanding it.

That's just the thing.  It's a consensus ledger, but a disagreement/schism has arisen on which ledger format/protocol is valid.  The man who created the name has vanished and cannot arbitrate, and all present forms have diverged from the form he created.  So no one has a claim to it.  It brings to mind the story of King Solomon being asked to decide who the real mother of a baby was, to which he decreed that the baby should be cut in half and split between the two, eliciting the true mother to cry out in horror and prove herself.  Time should ultimately tell, on the technical merits of the projects, and if it does not, then they should split the name with a suffix for qualification.
edit: I should say though, to be accurate - if you took a [diff]( of the code, looking for line-by-line similarity to Satoshi's code, I believe BCH wins that metric (ABC is the reference client, right?).

Hi Luke.  Couple questions...
* Why 85%?
* How long does it take to verify the 0's at the beginning of the hash plus the hash validity of a few MB block?  2 seconds?
* Doesn't the latency of downloading large blocks only run a few seconds as well on a fast connection?
* Finally - though I see your post is 6mo old - wouldn't you agree [this chart]( (admittedly pre-SW, pre-LN) demonstrates the block size limit was getting hit for half of this year?  
* Don't the mining fees vanish if a block was mined on top of an invalid block?

It's called that, but new money isn't really entered into circulation that way (unless the currency is actually manually inflated to back bank reserves by the government, like via bonds, which is a different thing).  It's more like, 100 people think they have $1000 in a bank account ($100,000 total), and ten people take out a loan for $9,000 each ($90,000 total), and the bank is counting on their depositors not taking out more than $10,000.  For big populations that often is the case, but when it isn't, you end up with catastrophic bank runs.

I don't let money dictate my words, thanks.  Do the math yourself - let's say 3 node connections per node, 1 billion people, at Segwit-1x's transaction rate of, say, 28 tx/s - that's 107 million seconds, or 3.4 years.   Now let's say you want to resettle the accounts of that that population, given the radical idea that their balances have all changed, and the settlement is distributed among all three of their connection nodes.  That's another 3.4 years.  Correct me if I have some fundamental misunderstanding of LN here.
This is why I mentioned IOTA, in spite of the scarier aspects of the project (roll-your-own crypto, 'copy protection', etc.).  Namely that the model starts with the idea of decentralizing validation itself.  Naive blockchains have some fundamental scalability issues, and offchain transaction layers aren't a very compelling solution.

Our current paradigm of "garbage" is very poorly thought-out - we're jamming food waste, plastic waste, etc.. into "garbage" and having someone haul it "away" (to a landfill).  This won't last forever.
To the greater point though, things need to get done no matter what.   Usually there is even a disparity between the "cushy cubicle jobs" and the more difficult manual jobs, in that the cushy cubicle jobs pay more - someone cleaning bathrooms at McDonalds is probably making minimum wage - so your theory that compensation is linked to the unpleasantness of a job is wrong.  
Consider the example of an Amish barn-raising.  It's manual labor, but they're not being compensated.  So there goes your other theory, that people have to be compensated for manual labor for it to be done.

It could be called a crime if that's taken as accurate.  It could conversely be described as libel if not.
Let's look at the text of one of these laws, the "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act":
(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) all explicitly say "accesses a computer" in some form.  Not applicable.  (a)(5) says "knowingly causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or command", but qualifies that with the consequence, "intentionally causes *damage* [emphasis added] without authorization". No damage done besides minor processing delays due to incompatibility.  (a)(6) is about faking authentication, like passwords, to gain access to a computer.  (a)(7) is about defrauding valuable things through threats or demands.   (b) follows up (a) to say the punishments are defined in (c).  (c) defines punishments.
"Network" is not a term used in this law, and "system" is only used sparsely in a non-specific sense.  The law deals with specific attempts to access restricted computers, damage information contained therein, online threats, etc..
Looks like a real stretch to call that applicable.  At best you could claim a temporary disruption to the availability of data, which is kind of a stretch considering we're just talking about two incompatible versions of a protocol.  Since neither chain has replay protection, and an operational, adopted version of the upgrade doesn't cause any kind of damage in and of itself, you could similarly accuse 1x of interfering with the 2x protocol - the "damage" would basically be the transfer of value from one chain to another in the inevitable event of one of them failing, which really is self-nullifying and a risk that's inherent to the Bitcoin protocol itself.   Ultimately you could claim the 2x nodes are not responsible for advertising whether or not they're compatible - the 1x nodes are equally to blame for rejecting blocks exceeding the 1mb 'weight'.  The fact that he committed a change - authored by someone else no less - to a Github repository, which when compiled and ran, could allow users not to be courteous enough to advertise they're not always backwards-compatible - doesn't seem like something that would hold weight as a criminal charge.  My 2 cents.

Yes, this is a good example of the kind of self-centered thinking that makes a society like our own default to a market economy, based on the sort of game theory-esque thinking of individuals as selfish actors.  Meanwhile, many other societies are composed of people who are focused on the needs of others, allowing higher levels of sociological functioning - "I'll do X so that I can get Y" vs. "how will it affect my community if I act like Z".  Ultimately it's a question of how culture trains individuals' motivations.

I don't agree a doubling or even octupling of the transaction rate/blocksize is a significant risk re: centralization, nor that a large blockchain must cause centralization more than 1/n (hash-sharding), nor that anything under about 40mb/10min is very concerning bandwidth-wise.   I think storage is very cheap, I think the human population constrains  well-pruned blockchain/UTXO set size in any well-incentivized system, and I think bandwidth just gets better and better, but that we need to be realistic about the sort of data integrity and storage requirements of a system which in its maximally-scaled form globally represents who owns how much - it's not a "must" or a current possibility that that fits on a cellphone or Raspberry Pi that isn't modded to the gills at the moment.  It is, however, something easily achievable by any business with maybe $300 to blow on making their payment system have all the niceties of Bitcoin (including hopefully, to be usable re: their business receiving payments).

A node can even review the entire history of the network but arrive at a compressed history by simply discarding the expired (empty) outputs.  It'll have seen it all happen, and decide only to remember which ones are still alive.  I think Satoshi himself said that exact thing, not sure what you're so taken aback about.
But even if you don't want to do that, you can fall back on consensus through network sampling. You'd be surprised how reliable that is. Basically, that's just a form of sharding.

I'm saying you store the distributed history like you would a torrent.  You can use hashing to rapidly verify a chunk of history trustlessly - it's a slight cheat, but relies on the same security methods used to make that initial validation, just over a wider area of data - namely, the protection against hash collisions.  Get it?  You take an SHA512 hash or whatever, of a 500mb chunk of the chain, you can say, OK, this is likely to be valid to the probability of an SHA512 hash collision.  Apply it again over two subsets of that data like a binary search, now you're really safe.  Insofar as the hash algorithm is safe to begin with.
Same basic security the protocol already relies upon, just a little lazier.

I've seen this statistic debunked - I think the LN paper it came from originally cited a *peak* throughput of VISA's network.
Your conclusion seems to rely on the idea that Bitcoin's blockchain size will grow endlessly.  But as Satoshi himself said, expired outputs can be safely pruned from non-historical full nodes.  In that event, the size of the blockchain is constrained by the size of the world's population * the average number of outputs per person.  If each output is 1kb, averaging 2 per person, that's only 14 terabytes.

A 51% attack and a hard fork are completely different.  A 51% attack is generally an attempt to enforce false transaction history for the benefit of the attackers.  If you don't like losing hash power over a fork, fix your difficulty adjustment algorithm.

Fractional reserve banking is possible with Bitcoin.

First, you can prune as you download.  As soon as an output is emptied, you can ignore it (at least until you see it reopened).
Second, you can just compute hashes for arbitrary segments of the chain, distribute them among all light nodes, and use that to validate the data supplied by full nodes.  Basically the same way we've been verifying downloads (esp. software downloads) for decades, and very much the same way Bittorrent works.

Neither solution is going to compete with VISA's peak volume until we have quantum storage or at least massive protocol-level sharding.  The fact remains that the main chain has hit the 1mb limit and couldn't onload enough transactions to have widespread Lightning adoption in the first place, and if you're looking to have transaction volume like VISA, the idea of everyone running a full node is ridiculous, you're taking about gigabytes of volume daily.  And even then, guess which chain will be more suited to on-chain volume?

I'm pretty much just following both and I'm not really in either camp, but noticed Bitcoin has been jamming against capacity limits, and I only got a message about one of the two subs (this one) deleting my comments.  There is certainly a substantial community of people on both sides.
Regardless, as a developer, I personally don't really care what anyone who isn't a developer (and also pretty good with economics &amp; game theory) thinks is the right move for the protocol.  I'm not taking a community vote on whether to use OpenSSL or GnuTLS for a job.

If it's your voice as 5 developers, you shouldn't really phrase it as "We, the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup, the largest bitcoin community in South Korea, founded in 2014 with more than 1600 members, would like to voice [...]".  It makes it sound like the membership took a vote.

This is your understanding of the situation, other people have different understandings.    From my perspective, it's obvious that a blocksize increase should have been adopted 6 months ago, because I actually went and looked up this chart: 
But to fix this, Core adopted Segwit as a "scalability increase", separating essential witness data on a side chain, screwing up the incentives for miners to verify blocks and weakening network security, which scales up only to the ratio of the removed data.  About as persuasive as the idea of disabling HTTPS to save on web server resources.  And what after that?  Makes other coins look like a better option in my world.

That bug was certainly serious, but so is this.  The lack of transaction capacity is apparently causing a decrease in usage and % of total crypto market cap, both of which also threaten the long term viability of the project.  Market share relative to other coins has a lot to do with their relative merits and commercial viability. Once you lose enough market share, you lose hash power, and you can probably fill in the blanks from there.

Both "sides" here are accusing the other of a corporate takeover.  says Blockstream wants to take over, says Jihan and Ver want to take over.   I'm more interested in figuring out the general merits of the various chains (including not only decentralization, but also efficiency, censorship resistance, etc.), for the sake of a general risk analysis.
The code itself, though, is open source.  No one can actually take it over - I think a proprietary, closed source release would meet with great resistance and be rejected by the market.  Anyone can take the open source code, fork it, make their own chain, whatever, the viability of any of which depending on community/miner/market support.  That is the ecosystem here.

I wouldn't be surprised at all to see tons of the BTC investment eventually going into a few different alts - Eth, Dash, Aeon, whatever (hell, maybe even IOTA or a work-alike).    Bitcoin has 70bn in market cap or w/e from first mover advantage, but the tech seems to be stagnating.  I think it'll enjoy its primary status for a while, maybe even a few years, but it's gonna need some major changes to compete with some of the up-and-comers.

That's not the idea.  It's that it's possible for an individual (and hence, a society full of them) to be able to work for the sake of performing a role itself and helping people, rather than in expectation of compensation.

It sounds like you really haven't looked into this much - check out the [ERC20 standard]( and [Plasma](  The ICO boom is demonstrative of how much can be done with the technology under Ethereum - but much like the internet, its actual use is reflective of human psychology.  Ultimately they essentially enable any form of deterministic, purely functional (IIRC) reasoning to be used in the context of a financial transaction.  
The simplest example is probably escrow - a smart contract can implement and enforce that a third party holds funds in escrow for a first and second party, until either the third party approves release of funds, or a time window expires.  The fact that this is implemented in-contract mean it's impossible for anything except an entire chain fork to invalidate it, if implemented without bugs.  Here's some examples of Ethereum escrow contracts: [1]( [2]( and an entire escrow platform: [3](  This is the tip of the iceberg.

In open source world, if we like a change, we merge it.  If there's a fork, go with the fork that works better.  If the devs are any good, they'll go with the fork that works better, ideally without throwing a tantrum about it.   
The price does not dictate which fork works better or which fork is the 'True Scotsman.'  The price is a function of what people like.  People have herd mentality, so following price trends alone to determine long-term outcomes, while it can be reliable, is not a universal indicator.
The lack of objectiveness around Bitcoin forks is really making me sick.  This is a general thing that gets on my nerves in this society, people just divide into groups and throw mud at each other, instead of working together and reaching a consensus, or agreeing some things are better for different applications.
*All 2-3 of these currencies are 'Bitcoin'*.  They're all forks of the original Satoshi code - dialects of the same language.  No one is committing fraud, this is just childish bickering over semantics.

Well, it's been under discussion for years ([here's]( the earliest one I bothered to look up just now), and the limit started getting hit hard [a few months ago]( yet the Core team is risking a potentially catastrophic fork instead of raising it.

I just told you how.  You prune expired outputs.  No money in an output at current state, no need for the vast majority of nodes to remember it.  Just like garbage collection in programming.
It's not just increasing costs for no reason.  It's that the usability of the network degrades when there's a transaction limit getting hit.  It's like saying you shouldn't upgrade your internet because a 56kbps connection is good enough if you just wait long enough for your packets, and you should only be looking at text pages anyway, not HD images and video.  When there's demand for HD images and video and a network that can support them, that's what people will end up using.

Satoshi made it so that difficulty equilbrates over time according to hash rate, to ensure a stable rate of blocks (1/10 min).  A disparity in price causing a fallout in hash rate will cause a big decrease in difficulty at the point of the next adjustment.  So that's not accurate.

That "97% of scientists" figure you're referencing is *based on a survey*.  I'm saying a survey is missing here.  You guys are using this statement as evidence of widespread community support, when it's a statement authored by five people claiming to represent 1600, with no concrete details on how they even made that leap more specific than "we reached out through multiple media".

I always read people in (I read both subs) saying Blockstream is trying to sabotage BTC for their own business interests re: off-chain transactions.  What do you think about that claim?
It seems to be that it's up to the community to ultimately do whatever it wants with Bitcoin's open source code.  And re: forks, it always struck me as a community issue - a highly contentious, not-replay-protected fork is going to create two chains, one of which has to rapidly wither and die to allow liquidity in the space - so it's really up to the users to decide which chain is valid.  That's the market we're in - can't get the rose without the thorns.  So the question really boils down to, which chain has better technical merits?  You're also free to fork bitcoin/bitcoin to work on 2x yourself - this is **open source**, you're not stuck with any implementation.
Hence, my question.

@_date: 2017-10-01 16:11:30
Wouldn't they continue the spam attacks if they were trying to promote adoption of BCH?  Sounds more like a migration of interest to alts, which the market caps seem to show.  Not surprising, with a contentious hard fork.

I think my comment dealt with this article's points pretty directly.  The 6th paragraph in this thing strikes me as very lazy reasoning - he thinks the block size is basically just the derivative of the function governing UTXO growth, but that's only ever true if the block size is the *limiting factor* of UTXO growth.  Ultimately this is a sociological question that falls back on issues like profit seeking, and even the slightest incentive towards generally consolidating transactions mixed with the fact that it costs money to make transactions to begin with is enough to discourage UTXO &amp; unpruned blockchain growth beyond discrete economic transactions ('buying a cup of coffee').  Then he goes off on this whole thing about MAST, Schnorr etc., which to my understanding are only tangentially related to Segwit.
