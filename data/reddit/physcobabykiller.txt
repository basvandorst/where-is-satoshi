It's done it. Get a yellow one.

Exactly. Those with the biggest stakes hold the most swing in any system. Unless you distribute an equal amount of the wealth to every person on the planet and make it illegal for one person or a group of people to conspire to hold or control more of the wealth than any other blah blah.

Very very wise words and an excellent guide.

Any moment now :)

Yeaa, cause banks never implode, especially in the last ten years.

It's moving money offshore (probably) to avoid taxes by making a deliberate loss to a company that has some connection to the depositor. Illegal of course.

Our governments will make it illegal to hold cryptography in unofficial non government validated wallets, probably within the next three years. They'll sell it on the premise of helping us keep our money safe from bad people. If you die, your wallet will be administered by ypur government. Either that or the amount of cryptography in circulation dwindles over time.

Possibly the most important bitcoin question ever asked.
Without OPEC the US Dollar is worthless (this is why Trump hates Iran)
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:10:09
Any idea when this is likely to happen?

There's more than one agenda behind the ethos of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:22:02
Yes. I use Trezor and its pretty idiot proof which in my case is paramount.

Single dad, three young kids, self employed. At 10K GBP my mortgage is paid and I can breath again. Cancelling the fork has made this real.

Looks like the mosts recent korean pump and dump is drawing to a close.

After the Vietnam war, the US owed quite a lot of money. Nixon did a deal with Saudis (1/3 of global oil is Saudi controlled) to trade all oil in US Dollars. This deal kept the currency going, the promise was taken off the note and lots of US dollars were printed and the war debt was gone. Opec continues to prop up the US Dollar, which the US Dollar would collapse. Iran refuse to play this game and sell their oil in other currencies. This is the reason Donald hates Iran (and Bush, etc)

If fiat becomes worthless then the blockchain will be the last thing on your mind.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:35:40
Yeah, until it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:04:42
OPEC is an american thing. Unofficially.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:31:42
Million dollar question to which absolutely nobody has the answer. To quote an earlier post, bitcoin always goes back up, except when it doesn't.

too many passengers, not enough drivers. Welcome to capitalism.
