Bitcoin's market cap is meaningless. I can't stand this rampant stupidity anymore.

Absolutely pathetic and delusional. I hope all you degenerates get burnt hard. I've got no more sympathy left for this level of stupidity.

Congrats. Now watch the smile do a 180 when it swings down. Stop tying your emotions to the price action. This is classic gambling degenerate behaviour.

Title alone makes me cringe. Too much emotion. This is going to end ugly.

I'm already rich, my net worth is \~$1.5m. I've made about $100k in crypto. I made my money with a real business, and some strategic investments. Unlike you idiots who just want to get rich easy and dream about lambos and going to the moon. You expect to be rewarded for being ahead of the curve, yet in reality you're already way too fucking late to the game and will ultimately be fucked because you're essentially degenerate gambling addicts with no edge in this game. The funny and sad thing is I've probably sold btc and other shitcoins at highs to people on this sub :D

Who said I missed out? I made 5x returns by trading the late 2017 spike and unlike the hodl retards I sold in Jan. I watch crypto closely, but I'm not dumb enough to fool myself into thinking it's anything but bullshit. What pisses me off is the self deception. None of you fucks will admit you're in it to get dollar rich.

My net is almost entirely liquid, and it's actually higher now, but I don't like to get too specific :) Most millionaires have it tied up in property, which I predict will collapse following a stock market decline which will happen in the next 1-2 years. Also, I did it all from $0, with no loans or financial help from anyone. Just straight hustle.
I exited exactly when I meant to, instead of hodling like most of the morons here. I have enough experience to know euphoria in the markets when I see it. And I was exactly right. I watched people on this and other related subs have emotional breakdowns over their lambo dreams collapsing.
All I'm really saying here is 1. its fine to make money in crypto or anything else, just dont lie to yourself and believe in the bullshit and 2. exercise risk management and dont get emotional in your investments. People on this sub are failing these two points BADLY. And it never ends well for MOST people like this.

I've made 6 figs with crypto and stocks. $1mm+ with my own online business. I have good intuition and foresight which has served me well and contributed to my success. I just loathe stupidity. I have nothing against making money from crypto. But the grand delusions expressed on this board are not only pathetic but a warning sign that humans en masse are stupid and say and do stupid things - and it's fueling this whole thing. It will come crashing down and it will be ugly.

Yeah, hard to imagine its significance when you're dealing in peasant money. Enjoy trying to become a millionaire by 'going to the moon' with your $1000 'investment'.
