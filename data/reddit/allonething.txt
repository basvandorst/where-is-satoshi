You might want to rethink using that particular analogy. At least in an American context, there are few activities with a lower success rate than armed resistance against the Federal government. The romantic fantasy that pointing guns at the Feds is going to help defend our freedom has gotten more than a few people killed.

If nullc's time was really an issue, he wouldn't be spending hours a day futilely arguing with people on r/BTC.

It works like this: everyone who agrees with you is genuinely supporting bitcoin, while everyone who disagrees with you is deploying armies of sockpuppets to manipulate events to their own selfish convenience.

My friend, I think the next few years are going to be emotionally difficult for you. Banks aren't going anywhere. If bitcoin continues to grow, more bitcoin banks like Coinbase will appear, and existing fiat banks will integrate bitcoin into their own systems and continue operating normally. And for most potential BTC users, this is good! The vast majority of people have neither the interest, spare attention or technical competence to be managing their own private keys, etc. The average user of financial services is far, far more likely to lose their BTC by trying to store it themselves than Coinbase is to get hacked or steal it from them.

$7 a vote? Peanuts, my friend. Pretty sure the going rate is over $30.

If you already knew the answer and had a strong, pre-formed opinion, why did you ask the question? Why not just be honest and say what you really think right away rather than pretending to innocently ask questions?

Because the two teams have wildly differing visions for where the development process should be headed longterm. Don't ask me to explain all that in detail -- I don't have time to write a 10,000-word essay -- just use the mind Google gave you and read any of the many, many, many, MANY Reddit threads, message board arguments, Medium posts, etc. that have amply covered the topic over the last several months.

Have we spoken? i think you've mistaken me for someone else.

It's allowed here because although its creator is publicly anonymous, insiders are aware said creator is a prominent Core developer, hence MW's widespread promotion here and on Core agitprop news sites like bitcoinmagazine.com.

Who knows? Different exchanges may handle it differently. You don't need to worry about it though, it's simple and easy to just pull your BTC off exchange during the fork. Use Electrum or another local wallet that gives you access to your private keys and you're good to go. You can always send them back to the exchange once the dust settles.
As a bonus, so long as you record your private key, you'll be able to access your coins on both forks if there's a persistent chain split like with, you know, that other coin.
