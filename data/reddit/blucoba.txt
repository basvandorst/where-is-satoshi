the beginning was a mess. Jimmy seemed to me like a drama queen. That said, Jimmy's first 10 minutes were brilliant! When he said that bcash was a text book FIAT currency, a light went off in my mind. He is exactly right. bcash was premined and airdropped. The market price is extremely manipulated. Then he spoke of the fighting between bitmain and nchain and proved that to be an example of centralization. 
Hat's off to you Mr. Song. Your talking points are perfect, pin point accuracy.  Please, next time, try not to let that little shit stain get under your skin.

Yeah, I read this...


and stopped reading.
You obviously suffer from a learning disability. It's the only reason I can find of why you are defending such a nonsensical, simpleminded thread that zig-zags between deranged conspiracy theory and socialist snowflake propaganda.
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:59:55
I can. First your context is here in a bitcoin forum about bitcoin. Nothing you said has anything to do with the bitcoin POSITION and everything NICK SZABO the person. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:23:24
So, you're quoting Satoshi, completely out of context. Wow, that's low.
Something needs to be explained to you... slowly. Your nick says Fin Tech but I imagine you're probably a low level helpdesk tech at some local bank or insurance company.
If you will, allow me to show you how what you are doing in this thread would align with your shitty job if any of your demons escaped the closet. None of the end users you talk to on a daily basis care that you dress up like a forest animal and hang out at all male chat rooms on the weekends, they just want you to change the fucking password and unlock their profile. What ever disgusting incel furry crap you do on your own time makes NO amount to how fast you can get their passwords changed and their profile's unlocked.
That's what AD HOMINEM means. You're attacking the person and not the work. Now, if you suck at your admin skills it's a different story, with some funny furry incel shit to go with it.

who asked you?
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:34:31
he could have made the same statement without the snarky "I love how" shit. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:27:55
If I did... I apologize. My bad. 
 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:07:05
this is the best. Man, I hope so :)

32 MB blocks + 1 Block every 10 minutes = 320 MB a day.
320 MB a day + 365 days in a year = 114 TB (that's TeraBytes) 
why tf would I want to download a 114 TeraByte chain?

I'm not good with wild "what if" statements... one could "what if" themselves ad infinitum.
Your analogy means that before Henry Ford invented the automobile the highway infrastructure should have been complete and ready. This is a false narrative.
I disagree 100% with you on this particular instance. Normal transactions would be just fine. I was using the network just fine 3 days ago. Plus, any new tech is going to have hiccups and growing pains. Cellular phone service comes to mind. broadband internet service falls into those category as well.
THIS is something else. something malicious. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:35:07
wow. don't tell me what to do internet tough guy.

This is the most informative comment in this thread BY FAR! thank you for this eloquent post.

I'm sure the way Roger Ver and Jihan Wu implement their version of pruning... also Craig "btfo" Wright... will be fraudulent.
anyways, I'm not subscribing to their default chain why the fuck would I mess with their molested chain? lmfao.

and felon who doesn't even care if an unsuspecting postal carrier  gets blown in the face with illegal industrial grade explosives designed for big agriculture pest control. He even tried to play it off like they were just "firecrackers". He's an unscrupulous capitalist and a serial grubstaker.

this is a misleading statement. This is nothing to "bank" on. While a smart or savvy investor should be and will be making their decisions on ALL of the available information. A "might not" situation is the last thing smart money should count on.
I assume that EVERY block will be 32 MB.
edit: P.S. b is not B iow bit is not Byte. there are 8 b's in one B.

I need my $1500 worth of BTC to confirm... it's been over 5 hours!!
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:00:36
I didn't know what to think. Perhaps you may have missed the part where I had asked if this is what spam looks like. I totally understand how you may missed the question in the original post. I do know that it took 14 hours yesterday for my btc transaction to get its first confirmation. 
Thank you for your question to my question. I hope that I answered your question to my question in an appropriate manner. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:09:52
do you have proof that 1MB blocksize is the exact reason for this?
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:45:41
it's not necessarily the "network's" fault I imagine as it is the maleficent players who have an advantage to spam the network. 
I mean this is not normal dude... My transaction alone has been "stuck" for over 7 hours. I can see that there are larger fee tx's still in mempool.
