When I said April, I meant [Tax Day]( which is almost always in April.

You mean arrested for tax evasion? Arresting someone is different than kidnapping someone, you don't see headlines reading "Police Kidnap Drunk Driver."


Relax, it's an analogy.


By living in the US, you live under the terms and conditions of US laws. If you don't want to accept that, you can go ahead and move to a different country.
EDIT: The 14th Amendment says: "persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

The IRS doesn't hit us over the head with a baseball bat and steal our wallet every time April rolls around, so I wouldn't call it violent.
Taxes are how various state and local governments stays running. It is also what pays for road maintenance and other services. Without taxes, the government can't function and the nation transitions into anarchy. While we may not agree on how our tax dollars are spent, we can agree that having a government to hold our nation together is better than chaos.
Imagine the US as a giant apartment building. People living in it need to pay their rent, otherwise they will get arrested for theft.
