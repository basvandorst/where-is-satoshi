I'll give what i've got for someone as generous as you.

Very helpful, thank you!

I'm so unhappy. I wanted more than anything to buy a bitcoin when they were at about $100 each. I knew it was something... I knew it. But I was getting my hours slashed at work, trying to pay off student loans, fixing my vehicle; just life in general had me broke.
It's awful to think back and know I was right, and that had I had a little bit of financial freedom, I could be sitting in a much more comfortable spot.

total income - bills = roughly zero up until recently. I'm recovering.

And so your argument is that if all electricity fails and we don't have any internet connectivity, you can't spend your BTC. You win this round.
Try going to a convenience store when the power is out. They can't open their registers. You still can't spend your cash.

I worked at a CVS when the power went out for a few hours. We were not able to do any sales at all, even cash, because we couldn't record inventory and sales accurately. I don't know what stores you go to, but a power outage rendered ALL forms of currency in my store temporarily useless. I'm assuming you've shopped during a power outage and have experienced otherwise?

You can't use your cash wallet if you don't have access to it.
You can't use your BTC  wallet if you don't have access to it.

I'm almost there! I see the light at the end of the tunnel. New boss, overtime, got my vacation hours paid out... I need to brace myself, money is coming.

I haven't had the financial freedom. I'm in a cheap apartment where I pay only rent, so I've been running faucets like it's nobody's business when I'm in que for DOTA2. 
EDIT: I'm considering using my steam wallet + steam inventory to try and trade for BTC. I'd just be trading cosmetics from DOTA2 and items from TF2 I don't need/want; things I wouldn't mind losing.

That's pretty much what I was worried about, but I couldn't find that phrase. (maybe I should have just asked that...) Thanks!

Sure, it could have been done, but my store choose not to. I don't know any of the legalities of the pharmacy, as well as how easy/hard it would be to balance out the cash after the power returned, how we could have accepted food stamps/WIC, checked people's credit card and debit card balances to ensure they had enough money in their account, and straighten out our inventory afterwords. 
Having said that, a store with significantly less unique products could probably handle a power outage a little easier. Maybe if you walk into a gas station and purchased a Coke or candy bar, it would be easy enough.

And does this mean BTC received in transactions won't be spendable until 4-6 confirmations?
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:13:04
I entirely disagree. That would give me enough breathing room for a while. That's 4 weeks pay for me. That's an entire bill cycle and then some.

If you drop your wallet down a sewer drain after 5pm or on a weekend, how would you pay for your goods and services?
