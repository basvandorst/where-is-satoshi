If you need a dispute system protected by third party like Paypal, dont use Bitcoin to purchase online or in store or in real life.

The meth is correct if you follow it form the top, the CNY total is excluding the Paypal fee.
To make it more clear it should say:
* Paypal: Buyer pay = 405.3 USD seller get 2315.69 CNY
* Bitcoin: Buyer pay = 388 USD seller get 2385 CNY
Sorry, is it more clear now?
So using Bitcoin buyer **pay less, seller earn more** , i know it sounds like bad math but prove me wrong.

Yes, im aware of the possible escrow services within Bitcoin.
This calculation is just showing the possible lower payment costs using Bitcoin.
I actually believe that a trustworthy seller would more likely give better dispute support for a Bitcoin payment then over Paypal, as 50-80% of Paypal disputes are lost in favor of the buyer.
A seller would get a much worse public publicity not solving a Bitcoin dispute then a Paypal dispute.

Use Paypal or credit card protection at higher cost if you buy from an untrustworthy seller or part, but why pay 17.3 USD if you dont need the protection ????
With Bitcoin you have a choice.

0.5 % of 2385 CNY is ~ 12 CNY.
Seller has a 69 CNY more profit with Bitcoin so 69 - 12 = 57
Means seller still has 57 CNY (~ 1USD) extra profit while buyer pay 17.3 USD less, or am i wrong?

Thanks for pointing this out, i have now updated the original post.
I could not believe the numbers my self, so i recalculated few times to make sure it was correct.

Please read is again slowly.
In both cases the product cost is exactly the same before the Paypal fees, in Bitcoin case buyer pay 388 USD instead of 405.266 USD.
So again using Bitcoin buyer pay 17.3 USD less
Seller earn 69 CNY (11.3 USD) more.
The total saving is 28.6 USD
Correct me if im wrong.

Currently there is no Bitcoin integration for our store software, we are waiting for something be become available to try using Bitcoin.
One big obstacle is also the complicated process of using escrow service, it does not looks possible at the moment as the payment has to be converted to fiat to protect us from the volatility.
