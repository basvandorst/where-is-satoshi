I have used this platform to purchase via national bank transfer without any problems. You should be aware of different payment services and their fraud services.
Credit/debit card: 3-5 days authorisation hold; you could buy XBT and then report the transaction as fraud to your bank defrauding the merchant.
PayPal: Similar to above, can do chargebacks. Ergo higher fees due to merchant risk.
National bank transfer: No chargebacks; once sent it's final!
Using the platform.
1) Initiate purchase with the seller
2) Wait for them to provide bank details; price is confirmed during initiation.
3) Once you have sent the funds from your bank to theirs, notify the seller. (Mark payment complete)
3.5) If the seller specifics for you not to "mark payment complete" and/or cancel the transaction after you sent the funds STOP! You will lose your money.
The sellers XBT is locked in LocalBitCoins escrow until you cancel the transaction you initiated.
4) Once you receive your XBT leave feedback, this is a community.
FYI, LBC will require KYC, as is expected. However, some merchants also do their own KYC, and sometimes extended verification (government ID, utility bill and webcam call).
Now move your funds from LBC into cold/hot storage. Enjoy and be safe.

I have been successful with the few trades I have made so far this month, although the hard fork and Bitcoin Gold have made trading more cumbersome. I will continue though, I am also using some extra BTC I had for investment trading, and will use this for a week to give myself higher returns. However, ultimate I will only invest on the initial from what I have earned down the road. As an additional bonus I have found zero fee trading platforms, which make returns on a 1% increase feasible.  
Thank you for the input and support.

Well I had already started this trading method, so without taking this particularly seriously I have already made ~20% of the initial investment this month: With the exception of one bad trading losing 2.6%. So maybe check back by the end of November and see if I'm earning 40%+ of the initial investment, or if i'm in the red.
Happy trading :~)

You can "sweet" the private key, which will transfer the Bitcoins to an address controlled by your master key (seed) using Electrum.

I should clarify, when I say 'Bitcoin network split' I am referring to the SegWit soft fork. Where the nodes which did not accept this upgrade kept the pre-SegWit blockchain. This pre-SegWit blockchain is what underwent another fork for Bitcoin Cash 8M block variant (then BCC, but later changed too BCH).

Not until their CEO's agenda is proven to be malicious. And despite this frustrating me, I am seeing more stop advising bitcoin.com as for new users it can be misleading or provide propaganda.
I am a firm believer in the concept of digital cash which DASH and Bitcoin Cash have implemented. Besides that the Bitcoin network split at the SegWit soft fork; it split for a reason.

Something similar on the wallet section of bitcoin.com, with listing Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core", despite that being the name used for the group devs of the reference implementation.
By that logic, Bitcoin Cash should be renamed "Bitcoin ABC".
I get BTC and BCH are unregulated, but this only harms the two by spreading confusion. Which further confuses new comers to the cryptocurrency community.

That probably would be the case, I discussed this in the reddit below. That with this logic Bitcoin Cash should be named "Bitcoin ABC".
I discussed this further @
