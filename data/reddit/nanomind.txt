I think they handled it very nice. I see this as a win for Bitcoin

substantial amount ; not too worried... if they handle this well; will keep them there. If this is indeed the internet in 1994 ..then these things happen. I hope to look back on this as an other milestone in Bitcoin adoption.

So in a world full of competing products, operating-systems, programming languages, asset classes and currencies;for some reason just in the crypto-space, we will have one coin to rule them all.....

Hi Chalash,
Thanks; yes that is what I try to figure out.
To me it now looks like the race is on every 10 minutes for just 1 Mb and enormous resources are thrown at it "just" to have 1 winner every 10 minutes. I was looking for some sort of "parallel" proces in which a lot of miners could mine 1 piece of the puzzle (1 Mb of transactions) and every 10 minutes these pieces would form 1 "full puzzle" that would then offer the 25 BTC reward and split it over all the miners who solved a part.  Since I can not comprehend the network effects / distribution; I am not sure it really solves anything. But I am just wondering if this would make a better use of all the nodes out there and could solve this Block-size issue.

Yes I understand this. But I try to figure out if you could use an other payment method to increase "the amount of transactions processed" without raising the 1 Mb block-size and give more (small and diverse) miners a chance to have a piece of the action. Very well possible I am missing something. 
If miners can offer 1 block per minute of 1 MB and only the 10th Block will "lock the payment" for the last 10 Blocks. Don't we then have 10 times more transactions processed in 10 minutes without increasing the Block-size; but by sharing the load. There would be a lot of Blocks that won't make it. But overall in 10 minutes 10 Mb of transactions would be processed. Should the need arise; you would split the partial payment even further. So that there are even more transactions. The Mb's that need to go over the network would be the same; but I am wondering if it would be more spread out among more miners (worldwide).
So pools could mine "partial payment Blocks" but only when the "key stone block" (the last one) is in place (every 10 minutes) the chain with all the partial-payments add up and the "race for the next sub-chain" starts
again...just thinking out loud :-)

Thanks for this.
Learning as much as I can, thinking about the Block-size debate and the distribution of miners. Just thinking out loud; what if you would split the fee in a few equal parts and the "last block" in this "miner payment line" would be the one that makes the "payment of the mining-reward whole". Would this not increase the Block-size relative to the 10 minutes of time.
So for example : the reward is split in 10 pieces. The first miner adds (unique) transactions, adds a 10th of the reward and publish this Block, The second miner checks this Block and adds new transactions also for a 10th of the reward. etc...
The last Block in this (sub) chain would need an additional check to see if all previous Blocks have the 9 correct partial rewards and includes it's own. 
My idea would be that these "partial reward" Blocks would be mined a lot faster; so the overall difficulty would stay the same only there would have been mined 10 times more transactions and (maybe) more small miners would have a piece of the pie.
I am probably missing something :-)  ..but I just keep wondering if this Block-size "thing"  can be spread out to all this enormous power that is already there.

Hi Jesset77, Thanks for the reply. Regarding point 3 I also saw a lot of mail about moving blocks around (bandwidth) so this was also one of the things floating around in my head to see if there would be any way in which you could have a race in a race where a market of smaller files would get more transactions done for the same reward and have some "better" use of all the resources.
Thanks again; a fellow armchair observer with general coding experience (though C++ is nowhere near my favorite language ;3) who's been around the concepts not long enough; but enjoying the company of people who are and are willing to explain. :-)
