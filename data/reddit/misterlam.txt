Just do it, I'm from Australia and back in High School I had the chance to buy a couple of Bitcoin for a few hundred dollars but I didn't because I though it was a fad. This was about 5 years ago.
Biggest regret.

I'm getting a Windows Defender popup when I try to open Electrum 3.0.0, says publisher unknown and I did download it from the website directly.
Didn't get this error when I was using 2.9.3
Any ideas?

I've only been using the standalone executable.
Might have to hold off for 3.0.0 for now, I guess

Only 0.12 for ~5 months of mining? That's so little..
I've got over 1/3 of a BTC from a 5x1070 rig mining since June using nicehash

Mining is fun, just another hedge if bitcoin ever becomes worthless then at least you still have hardware to sell.
For me, I like the tinkering so its more of a hobby

AMD cards are better at mining, especially the RX580/480 but almost impossible to get a hold of. If you have a look at the [profitability calculator]( on the nicehash website, the GTX 1070 isn't far behind making similar amounts per day. Also look at the algorithms each GPU mines and you can see nvidia cards are much more diversified in algorithms so it depends what you want to mine as well.
I personally went for the GTX 1070 purely because of the multiple algortihms.

Well [this]( was posted by the developers, so you seem pretty correct.
