Yeah, I think it was someone getting into my wallet. I had set up all levels of security so that I'd receive notification of any wallet access, but somehow they must have got past that.

I will check when I get home, but I know I setup two step authentication with the google Authenticator app and I made a note of my memorable words in the physical realm, away from the digital realm. I did get a quick reply by blockchain as follows...
Hello, and sorry to hear about this. You may have some type of malware on your computer that resulted in your funds being stolen, because your private information was somehow obtained. One of the most common types of these are browser extensions posing as bitcoin price tickers that are actually stealing your account information. There's also the possibility that you visited a phishing site posing as blockchain.info. We've also heard of computer viruses that detect when a bitcoin address is in your clipboard, and replace the one you wanted to use with an address controlled by this malicious party.
By design, Blockchain.info never has access to users' accounts or bitcoins. If you keep your password and private key backups secure, then your bitcoins are safe with blockchain.info. You can read more about how our wallet works -  Since this information has been compromised, be sure to never use this wallet or addresses contained within it. I'd also highly advise against using the same password again. Sorry again that you had funds stolen from you. That certainly must be an extremely frustrating experience.

I set up a blockchain account on my home computer which is a mac and I also set up the app on my iPhone. I purchased the bitcoin through blockchain using a company called coinify.
