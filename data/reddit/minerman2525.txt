Thanks for the ELI5 that helps a lot. You get an upvote!

NP, guess it's a win win because I get money too! LOL but as I said, I'm just mining a bit of Peercoin until I can get this rig properly moved into where it needs to go. You can thank me in a couple weeks!

No, I just got offered these miners by a generous person in this sub so I thought it would be proper to post in this sub. As I said in the title of this post "shoutout to the amazingly generous community here". here beigh this subreddit.

Please don't post here with ludicrously simple questions that you could answer yourself.

I bought the U3 to learn how miners work and to get them set up, but since it's worth practically nothing I don't want to sell it. I'm looking for a slightly more powerful miner.

As I said I'm only mining PPC until I can get the miners moved into their permanent home. Thanks for the advice though :)
@_date: 2015-05-02 03:41:22
tried that and most other easy stuff like that. got anything else?
@_date: 2015-05-02 12:51:01
ok ill try that thanks
@_date: 2016-01-03 03:31:06
This is awesome, if you ever start to sell these I would totally add these to my mining rig just so I can keep an eye on the prices. Super cool and super useful.
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:35:02
I got it working but thanks for the offer.
@_date: 2015-08-29 20:27:53
I think that's for the S3, not the U3.
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:29:10
i've looked at those and they are too expensive i am looking for something unter $100 so if you could suggest anything else that would be great
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:40:21
yes i know that antminer is the way to go i was wondering is rou could name a specific model or two
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:06:08
ok thanks for the feedback i am now to reddit so the feedback is very helpful.
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:00:49
ok but thanks i looked at an antminer s3 would that be reasonable to get me started even if i wont make any money from it?
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:48:16
i know i wont make much money i just want the satisfaction of knowing i mined a fraction on a bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:38:34
thanks i am selling some junk on ebay to get one or two of the U3s so i can start gaining the tiniest amount of bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:07:21
this was just an opinion sorry it it such a big deal for people to make a mistake
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:53:24
is there room for me to get some bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-04-27 23:39:53
i am a kid so my dad pays the power so what i take from your last response is that if i have no power costs it is worth it?
@_date: 2015-04-28 10:46:13
