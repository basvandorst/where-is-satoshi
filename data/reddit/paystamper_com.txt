If someone offered me $1000 for a bitcoin RIGHT NOW (1/24/2015 1:26p est), I'd sell and sell and sell and sell and sell....
Buy more coins for appr $250, and sell those for $1000, until I couldn't sell any more. Then its back to hoarding/saving

Hey. This was a nice idea. We have something similar. Similar as in you basically use your bitcoin address as a form of a communication channel.
It goes like this:
1) A sender enters your bitcoin address.
2)The sender enters in the minimum amount of bitcoins set by you. This could be 0.0002 all the way up to whatever you like.
3) The sender types in their message &amp; sends the correct amount of bitcoins to the service.
4) You recieve the bitcoins immediately, and if they paid your minimum requirements, you'll also receive a notification.
We are still working out the kinks before its on paystamper.com.
But you can take a look at it here:

I had to laugh. Yes, once the bitcoins are gone, they are gone. However, many bitcoiners use an address to send payments to automatically. And if those bitcoins leave that address unexpectedly, they will get notified, and can prevent future payments to that address. 
Another case, not security per se, is to monitor the address of a loved one to make sure they aren't spending bitcoins that they aren't supposed to be spending. You can get a notification when that happens.

This is interesting to me. Ive never used coinbase before, after several failed attempts. But do they document who pays the transaction fees, the buyer or the seller? Or are there no fee until withdrawl/conversion? I wonder if your buyers bitcoin was shaved as well?
If my memory serves me correctly, the old mt.gox charged a flat .25 cents. But i cant remember who paid or when this was paid.

Way to go by getting your supplier to accept bitcoins as well. I think I  remember your website from a while back. I was searching to see if there was a laser powerful enough to heat up an object from afar. I believe your website shows a laser popping a line of balloons.

As long as bitcoin and gold exist, Pete will always have something to talk about.

Thanks for the post. I think this is very relevant. This highlights that when using exchanges, money transmitters, they must comply with so many laws, many unbeknownst to the end user.
What im wondering if the same outcome would happen if the same parties would have used bitpay/coinbase?
I believe that bitpay and coinbase are in the same boat as paypal.

This is nice! I honestly tried to use my bitcoin address as my user name last week. But, its too long.
Before viewing this post, i was thinking of asking reddit to allow people to use a bitcoin address as a username.

This! I was listening to max keiser's guest, who is in mexico. He says that Mexico asked Us for their gold back. US told Mexico that it was somewhere in Europe, aka, US doesn't have it!
Not only this, but it gets deeper, imo. I've noticed some companies that are no longer accepting gold. Why? Because they claim that the gold market is quite fraudulent. They said that it was getting more complicated to tell where the gold came from. Im not a gold expert by any means, but i thinking that if you dont know where the gold came from, affects its value.
And like i've been saying all along, gold can be counterfeited. Even some of the top gold merchants have been fooled  more than they would like to admit to. This is why i dont forecast gold as being the alternative/back up when the currencies crash. Atleast not for the masses..

I understand your perspective. However, if you look at localbitcoins.com, you'll notice that prices vary quite significantly. And thats their right to charge however much they would like to for their coins/service.
But for you to say that btm are ruining the wide spread adoption due to their high price is rediculous, imo.  Thats just like saying rolex is ruining it for the watch industry because of their extremely high prices. All watches have the same function, but prices, styles, quality varies. 
My point is that the market will decide if these btm and their "high" rates will survive. I imagine if someone really needed some bitcoins in a hurry, BTM's seem like a plausible solution. Whhat did your buddy do in the end?

Im not the type to give a knee-jerk response. The best storage option for a noob is a very subjective question. Is this short term storage or long term storage? Are you a noob with bitcoin or with technology? How much trouble would you go through for extra security? Would you be able to download a file and run that file on an offline computer? And print out a paper wallet via an air gapped printer?
If so, go to bitaddress.org, download the github. Run it on a computer that isnt and never will be connected to the internet. Run the file, print the paper wallet. Send funds to the address on that wallet. Keep that paper wallet secret, and share it with NO BODY!

I totally agree, in the general sense. They can do unlimited amounts of misdeeds... until its proven that they did it!  At that point, we'll have a mt.gox 2.0. 
However, being that im for free trade (not to be confused with "fair" trade), let them hang themselves. If we as bitcoin users, try to ban exchanges from certain behaviors, we are shooting ourselves in the foot.
They wont last long if they get too currupt in the land of too much information.

Paystamper.com is the BEST. No registration, no signing up, no gimmicks. 
Bitpay is an EXCHANGE. It takes bitcoins and converts them to fiat  then sends it to the business, merchant. Bitpay clients, as you mentioned, dont really need to accept or see ANY bitcoins.
If you want to accept bitcoins, not fiat, use paystamper.com. All you need is your bitcoin address! We dont ask for your name, or anything else.

There was someone who posted on here, a few days ago, about running an operating system via the blockchain. I don't think I chimed in, but I thought it was a brilliant idea. I imagine it as a blockchain, but for an operating system. It wouldn't be much different than bitcoin for the most part. It would start off as a simple (subjective), open-source, free, program. Lets say 20 or 30 TRUSTED people (of course, this would be subjective)  downloaded and used this exact same operating system. These 20 or 30 people really believed in this OS. They allowed anyone to download the version they were using; and when you download it, you are connected to the other users of this OS so they could verify you indeed had the same system. And lets says they find a bug or a vulnerability in the software, if the majority of the users agree that it needs to be patched, then its automatically patched on all the users of the OS. And, if you found a vulnerability in the system, and the others didn't agree (or if you were an agent), you could either:
-exploit and profit from their ignorance 
-create and start your own OS from that point
Once it got up to 4-5k people, it would either be all good, or still in the 'wild wild west.' But at least, everyone was on the same playing field and it would even out over time.
Maybe Satoshi is working on such a project. I don't think the establishment has had enough of him yet ;)

Thank you for your thoughts. It is 100% up to the user as to how many addresses they would like to use. They could use one or one thousand addresses. We presume that people want to start accepting payments immediately instead of signing up and registering with a third party to begin accepting.

Define "mass."
what about the time until we reach "mass"?  And even then, if they pass a bill that regulates bitcoin, mass or no mass, they can still end freedom.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:53:31
After giving this question some thought, my answer is i dont know for sure. But ill speculate that this couldnt be possible. Why? Lets begin by honering the fact that they have the same origin, only differing by the hard fork split. And you have one wallet with coins. Keep in mind the each blockchain is  constantly being updated by confirming ALL transactions. If you spend some coins on the new block chain first, that transaction will eventually reach the other blockchain, the original. So both blockchains are aware of that transaction. So if you tried to spend those same coins on the original, it will be denied because it already has confirmed that the coins have been spent.
Another situation is that if you tried to double spend simultaneously, it would be a race to confirmation, and one would eventually be confirmed, and the other denied.
This is the reason double spends cant ultimately be successful. Every coin has a history, even if its no history, therefore, mathematically, a coin cant have two different histories for an extended period of time.The only way i forsee anything like this happening is if some protocol drastically change and a whole new coin was created and the two chains wouldnt be able to communicate with eachother.

This could start a race:
A race to free software
A race to honesty and copylefts
A race to hide deeper in computers
A race to prosecute whistle blowers
I think the race will be determined by one thing, where the consumers send their money. If consumers continue to send their money to those companies believed to be willing participants in this spying, then it will be a race to hide deeper within. But if the consumers spend with the free, open sourced programs, then it will be a race to honesty. I believe it will be the former.

I understand what you are saying about more options are better for the consumer. And this is my point. Right now, the only option to pay governme t taxes is using the notes from the private company the federal reserve.
If the US citizens want to choose a different fiat, or continue using the same one is up to its citizens. However, other private entities should be able to create their own money, and citizens can choose to use it without any regulation from the government.

The stamp page is where you enter in the address you want to send funds to, it could be your own if you would like to test for trust. In the description, you put whatever you want to be stamped into the blockchain.
Then put in the amount, and send the payment to us. We stamp the blockchain and forward the payment to the address put in by you.
Our goal is to be the pay as you go, no sign up, no registration bitcoin payment processor.
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:59:47


100% correct. Thats what you get when you have 100% control. A bank doesnt give you 100% control, therefore you arent 100% responsible for a lost or stole card/funds.


Educate yourself then use common sense.
