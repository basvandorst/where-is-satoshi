For years I was a huge bitcoin supporter when I lived in Erie and nobody knew about it. Now everyone seems aware of this ATM like Erie has become a bitcoin hotspot. Drives me crazy.

We cashed it out right before the fire, which thank god was clutch as I had the keys for it kept at my house. It was $4000 total which paid for some outstanding vet bills and about 100 kitten vaccines and some other essentials like food and litter. It saved the life of a cat who needed an echocardiogram as well as some other guys who got treatments for eye issues that now arent blind, so thank you!

Apparently the company she works for had them made for a promotion. She used "  (40 cents a coin, like time travel to 4 years ago!) but I found a number of places on the internet for a little cheaper like  and some others. Can't speak for the chocolate quality though as I haven't eaten any, I'm Hodl'ing in case they increase in deliciousness over time.

Poor shibe
No stickers
Such dissapoint
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:36:20
add them to coinmap!

I would take another pic but shortly after this my cat went screaming across the floor and scattered them everywhere. I'm just done now.

I think normally they arrive pretty reasonably, but holiday mail season internationally is always a nightmare. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:02:55
This is excellent advice, I don't even think its safe to keep even one in my hot wallet. Its just too warm in my pants.

It's an Angry Orchard Hard Cider for size comparison, and it was delicious (but did not come with the stickers)
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:26:44
They do!

I just realized why the sweetimpressions ones were more expensive. The other side of these is her business' custom logo. The ones on gocandy are just generic chocolate bitcoins.

They're pretty legit. My package hadn't arrived after like a week (I didn't realize it was coming from serbia during the holiday mail slowdown) and I emailed them about it. They actually offered to completely resend the entire order + bonus stickers as an apology if it didn't make it by yesterday.  It actually arrived that afternoon. Case in point though they had my BTC and still were cool about customer service. Would def recommend.

So I'm working on this project currently and needed some crypto stickers. Ebay was crazy expensive but I heard about bitstickers.net so I tried it. 
For the record, I have literally nothing to do with bitstickers.net. I'm an american and this package came from Serbia.  The whole process was easy peasy and I paid in BTC. Total cost was 0.01623750. 
Just when I actually got the stickers I couldn't believe for one how many stickers I actually ordered, and for two how little I paid for how many I ordered. They're really nice quality too. Some of them are literally only a penny for a sticker. 
In any case I wanted to share this with the BTC masses. I know there are tons of "X place is accepting BTC" but this was the first time I actually bought anything online with BTC and the whole process was pretty smooth.

I've been carrying the extras around with me and placing them strategically. I found an excellent place for one in a public bathroom today, lol.

Thanks for the advice here everyone. Jcoinner helped me out with a password recovery tool he wrote for me and eventually I did end up getting my coins back. He got some btc out of the deal, I got mine back, everyone wins. =)

0.1% at most, maybe a couple a year. mostly just supporting the system and the one random person who asked.

We do, but those patients have no copay. This is strictly for patients who cash pay (no insurance) or want to pay their copay this way. I had one ask (which admittedly I was pretty shocked but pleased about). They heard I was into tech stuff, I'm not sure if they were totally serious, but it sounded cool. The person had some on their android wallet too. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 20:09:17
Me too, I think we have the same problem 
@_date: 2016-12-14 20:10:06
This is a major reason right here.

In regards to Tibanne I think he's probably set for life on his own island somewhere.

Its about the fact that we created a cat cafe which takes bitcoin, and we welcome it for adopting cats, coffee, or in donations. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 22:50:23
Thanks so much! Here is the usual schedule: 
Sunday – 11am to 4pm
​Monday &amp; Tuesday – CLOSED
Wednesday – 10am to 4pm
Thursday &amp; Fridays – noon to 6pm
Saturday – 11am to 5pm
Though its definitely good to call and make double sure as we're all volunteers and every now and again we simply can't keep it open on a scheduled day due to not having enough staff yet. This schedule is valid about 95% of the time though.

We've been working hard to develop the Catfe and do what we can to help the cats of Ferndale and greater Detroit. 
The Catfe is the culmination of years of work, and we're just getting started! We have yoga with kittens, coffee, treats, 
and cats galore for our visitors to enjoy. We're currently hoping for donations to purchase some IP cameras so we can live stream the Catfe and what we do to the entire world. We hope to soon expand into a larger space and be able to foster far more cats and have a lot more space for people to come and spend time studying, enjoying a hot drink, and enjoying some cats. 
Visit our website at  or visit us in person at 821 Livernois Avenue - Ferndale, MI 48220
We also sell outdoor cat shelters at cost of materials to help your local ferals survive the Michigan winters. We're also very involved in Trap-Neuter-Return efforts and are a 100% no kill shelter dedicated to humane treatment of feral colonies.
We welcome all donations, especially at our bitcoin address which is: (Removed to comply with post standards, sorry!) 
We love the transparency of bitcoin donations, and will let everyone know exactly where they go. 
If you'd like to make your donation tax deductible, please let us know and we can provide you with the proper receipts and form.  
Thanks so much for checking us out and for helping us save more cats!

Admittedly we have been accepting Bitcoin for 48 hours now, we hold a total of 0.2 Bitcoin. I'm one of 6 board members and I just convinced them to do this. I'd love to see the project advance and have even more Bitcoin integration but for at least our first week taking it for food/coffee/cats was a big deal. I'm not sure if there is anywhere else in the world you can pay to adopt a cat in Bitcoin and so I think that's a first!

So I just personally got back from japan and posted about my bitcoin experience here: 
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:02:06
We were pretty disappointed in coinmap though, it led us on kind of a wild goose chase and I couldn't figure out how to actually remove the bad nodes for all the places we tried to go. We literally went to every bar in roppongi (except hackers bar) that said they accepted it and all refused us. Sucked. 
Numazuko was fucking delicious though and didn't even seem excited for me to pay by bitcoin, they seemed like it was a pretty usual thing for them. Sometimes retailers make a big deal of it when you do as you're like the first person in a month. I think its pretty common for them, and they had a lot of bitcoin stuff up.

I'm a family doc and I'll be accepting it in about a year in michigan

I would like my tip to go to the charity agency that helped me get my cat Sirius! They just started accepting bitcoin for adoptions/donations, I've been meaning to make a post about it. They accept it right on their frontpage!
