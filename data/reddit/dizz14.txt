Come on man, I'm here for the same reasons you are. I'm doing as much as I am comfortable with. Every day I'm changing how I do things to be more private and self-sovereign and everyday I do more and more to support the space. But I can't change all at once. Going from 0-100 real quick isn't helpful.

Yes it doesn't look great. I'll get a case at some point.
Any tips? What kind of channel management practices should I follow? Lots of small channels? A few bigger channels? How do I pick a good channel? I don't have a bunch of capital so the biggest channel I could resonably open would be about $100. What about peers, should I collect as many peers as I can? What kind of information is shared between peers vs channels? Should I set up autopilot? DynamicDNS? UPnP? I have a very basic idea of what these options mean but not enough to really make a decision...
I turned on the RTL web interface and it looks great. I'd really like to get to know the ins and outs of the whole system so I can manage it effectively and tailor it to what I like

I spend and save just as much as I normally would with fiat. I have a spending wallet and a savings wallet. I "hodl" with my savings meaning that bitcoin will not be spent until I'm ready to retire. 
Idk if I totally buy into the hodl meme. I mean, its just savings. I won't spend it until my time preference. I don't necessarily see my hodling (savings) as doing a service for bitcoin adoption. I see treating it like I would treat money as a service to bitcoin adoption.

I'm just wishful thinking. It'd cool if amazon and my local coffee stand could accept it. I'm not necessarily saying every Tom, Dick and Jane should actually use it. Just that those who already are opsec concious have the option. Where's the harm in that?
@_date: 2019-11-03 08:20:25
Almost certainly I think. Our entire technology ecosystem will likely have changed so dramatically that we treat money and value wildly different. More than 100 years away I can't even hope to grasp how weird things would get. If it is still a cryptocurrency on a blockchain or something similar it will be very different from what bitcoin is now.

Worked for me when I used it a few months ago. Won't be using it again though, too many risks. I'm hoping paywithmoon fixes their amazon problem soon.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:31:25
Mostly about people recieving stolen goods. Idk how much of a risk it actually is but its more than what I'm okay with.
Honestly having a person who doesn't work for purse fulfill my order kinda makes me uncomfortable. However I think if you select a discount less than 5% I believe purse fulfills it themselves.
In any case paywithmoon seems better since I can use my own account but it hasn't worked for amazon payments for a couple of weeks now.

You reek of self-importance and entitlement. You must feel so much better than people who haven't had the same opportunities to learn how to be safe and self-sufficient. We shouldn't be throwing people's lives into the gutter because they need help. Learning to be self-sufficient isn't as easy for some as it was for people like you or me.
Obviously, we want these people to be able to take care of themselves instead of needing help but a massive majority of the world's population is not ready to control their own keys. If my parents wanted to get started with bitcoin, it would take me a long time to explain it to them and I definitely would not trust them to understand enough to be safe with it with what's currently available. Does that mean they should be poor? Absolutely not. They're still valuable human beings.
@_date: 2019-11-20 18:27:21
The github page for raspiblitz has a walkthrough in the readme. I just used that. I sprung for the pi4 with 4gb ram so that I could download the blockchain and verify it myself directly with the pi quickly. I had a pi3 laying around that I was going to use but it would take way to long. The 4gb pi4 took around 3 days.
The SD card was 32gb but you don't need a card that big. I just had this one laying around.
I got a 500gb ssd. If you don't mind spending a bit more maybe consider getting a 1tb one.
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:11:21
Mobile wallets shouldnt have very much money on them anyways. I'd say less than .01 at a time. Any more than that you should keep on hardware. I like Green for newcomers because its fairly intuitive, open-source, supports segwit, has RBF, and is actively developed. Once that newcomer is more familiarized though they might want to switch to something with more features like Samourai or Electrum.

The upfront fees is an important topic. I think Joost is right that they should be a last resort.

There are other ways to fix the bandwidth waste and upfront fees is a step in the wrong direction.

I'm for sure not saying we would remove money as a concept or that we wouldn't have a system for value exchange. Just that it would be so so weird. Like who knows maybe we'll have timers on our arms that count down till our deaths and we pay each other in minutes of life.

I think it's morally reprehensible that you shrug this off so easily. You never know who's on the other end.

What? No way. My needs passion and ideals are repressed because if I don't work more than half my waking hours and spend the other half desperately trying to not spend any of the money I just made.... I won't have a roof above my head or food to eat. I'm constantly in a state of thinking "is the next setback going to put me in a position where I need to ask for someone else's money?"
You're speaking of nature like there's some driving force that's pulling us back to the way we used to be. To basic instinct. There isn't. People are becoming more intelligent and mindful everyday. The brain finds a way to be sad whether it has money or not. Difference  is that if a wealthy person is sad, they have more options to remedy it.

I got a referral of $5 when I used Dax Shepherd's code when I signed up. 
Their KYC process was pretty clunky. Took me about a week to be able to buy more than $50 worth of btc. When I contacted support they basically said "yeah that can happen, wait a week and see if you get cleared ��‍♂️". 
I had the perception that their bigger spread was well known. It's because they don't have fees. (The fees are in the spread, essentially). The price they show on the chart isn't the buying price. The buying price is shown when you try to buy and on the confirmation screen.
Despite all this, I find I prefer it over coinbase.

Well put. However, I do think whales are a bit more of an annoyance rn. When a whale sells and drops the price, they cause a bunch of weak hands to also sell dropping the price further. The whale can then turn around a buy back what they originally sold with a bit of profit on top. 
The larger the market cap the less ability they have to do this so I think it is an increasingly smaller problem. But I think to say "whales can only sell once" is a bit of an overstatement.
Tbf, I'm not sure if my understanding here is what actually happens.

I use it. I'd rather use a non-kyc option but its extremely convenient. Someone here did the math before they raised their fees and said it was marginally cheaper with cash app. Not sure if it has changed since then. To me, it feels better to buy from a larger spread than to pay fees in either case.
@_date: 2019-10-19 02:08:13
Yeah that's kind of a work around but if amazon accepted bitcoin right now it'd be preferable. Most of my amazon buys are less than 50 bucks and the discount doesn't offset the inconvenience of using purse.io. I like it for bigger buys though.

In countries where the government oppresses a vast majority of their citizens having access to private transactions is a necessity. Should I deny them that right?

I wish bisq and other p2p exchanges were as convenient as cash app. I'd rather buy from actual people without using kyc but its honestly kind of complicated for me. I don't really wanna get Zelle and the escrow thing is confusing and I don't wanna mess anything up. Like, I have to use btc I already have in order to buy more btc. Also, its really convenient to be able to buy such a small amount at a time. I hate kyc but like... its so much easier :/

I think its important to parent your own kids and teach them the values you care about. If you want them to have a respect for value and money, give them an allowance and don't break from it just because they spent it all on one game. 
When I was a kid my siblings and I all got an allowance of like a few bucks a week. My brother always spent it on small things like candy or whatever. I saved up and bought an ipod touch (also did extra chores and mowed lawns for extra money). My brother of course was jealous and thought he should get one too but my parents didn't cave. Well eventually my brother saved up and got one too. He earned it and that taught him not to throw his money away on things that had no value.
I think it's wrong to put responsibility on other people saying, these games are teaching our kids to waste money. Instead, teach your kids yourself to know what has value and the value of delayed gratification.
Would I let my kids play this game? Sure. Would I let my kids spend more money than they have? Of course not. When my kids ask me if I will buy them something, I'll tell them to save up and show them how to do that.

Now is a great time but if you're interested in bitcoin you should buy on a schedule without thinking about what the current price is. Also known as DCA or dollar cost average. This basically eliminates loss and helps you save for the long term instead of panic selling when the price dips like it is now.

Privacy is a major concern. Lightning could use an extra year or so to simplify channel management and improve route finding but the overall architecture is almost as elegant as base layer bitcoin. The next soft fork coming up will do a lot of good too. 
Tbh I'm of the opinion that a very steady pace would do better for bitcoin than mass adoption would. Obviously I would love to get paid in and pay for everything in bitcoin. But I'd be worried about how many bad actors we would very quickly get in the space. The amount of people who would know the difference between some shitcoin and bitcoin in the world right now is a big yikes. Education is another pillar of bitcoin I would love to see some growth in.

All of your channels are opened to nodes controlled by Acinq. BUT the privacy concerns will be somewhat better soon with Trampoline.

This ep and the last one are the type that I look forward to. Improvements and implementations of lightning are the most exciting aspects of the space right now. The more reliable and easily usable it is the more we can expect lightning to be bitcoin's p2p payment platform.
Glad to hear RTL is moving forward with some UX changes. The easier it is to manage a routing node the better.

I think you'll be hard pressed to find something like that. Setting up a full node takes time. You'd probably have to incentivize someone into walking you through it step by step and the fact that they would be doing it in a private space would be extremely unsafe. They could scam you or give you bad advice without anyone else there to call them out on it. I know some of these topics are difficult to grasp but its important to do your own research and experiment.
That said, there are some companies that are trusted plug &amp; play node sellers like the ones listed here under plug &amp; play.
If you want to ask specific questions you can do so in a post like this one and people will generally be helpful. Or make a post on r/bitcoinbeginners

Its pretty fun :) worth a few minutes of distraction at work haha. I would recommend making the doors require pushing a button to go through. I like to collect everything from the level before moving on and a couple of times I went through on accident. On that same note, I'd say when the printer prints the bank notes, those extra notes shouldn't give any bitcoin. Otherwise I could just sit there shooting until I've racked up more than 21 million ;)

Try out these ones. I usually recommend sending a small amount between each of them to get an idea of which one you like best. You'll pay a bit in fees but finding the right wallet for you is important. You should only use wallets that are non-custodial, open source, and actively developed.
Samourai is another one worth checking out but is not as beginner friendly.

Assuming you've funded the lightning wallet section in your Bluewallet app.
1) In the comment that the bot just created click deposit, it will auto generate a message from you to the bot. 
2)In this message you can specify how many sats you would like the bot to invoice you for (default is 10000) then click send.
3) The bot will respond with an invoice that you can copy.
4)In the Bluewallet app lightning wallet section click send.
5)Paste the invoice and click pay.

Is a decentralized social media feasible? It'd be interesting to see something like that but I imagine it would have its fair share of problems.
Ideally this new standard they're looking for should have an expectation of privacy and direct control over our own personal data. and it will need to find a balance between censorship resistance and having a way to combat disinformation otherwise bot farms spreading propaganda will have a larger influence over the masses than they already do. Fact checkers and censorship are centralized and won't work in a decentralized system.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:44:29
It would be rather confusing for a wallet without amp to be receiving ten 10000 sat peices of when the invoice they generated was for 100000 sats. Payer and Payee both need to support it.
Edit: Doh. I misread your question. I'm also pretty sure they original sender would need to support amp. I don't think a routing node could split it up on behalf of the sender.

Why don't cannabis dispensaries accept bitcoin? Or at least have bitcoin atms? Seems like since they can't get bank accounts and visa won't handle transactions to their business that bitcoin would be an obvious solution but I only see cash. There's gotta be a reason for that right?

I'll have to take the time and actually look into it. I think I just read too many grumpy reddit posts not unlike mine lol.

I do believe that it's everyone's responsibility to put into the system that everyone benefits from. The gap between the people who go to work 5 days a week (or more) and the ones that don't is enough to make me complain about something that I'm admittedly not educated enough about so I end up saying things that might not be true and sounding stupid

It seems to me like the biggest issue with taxes isn't the everyday joe schmo. Its the major corporation loopholes and hidden offshore accounts by the top dogs. I bet most tax fraud that is committed by the lower class isn't intentional. The US tax system is needlessly complicated and I'm sure turbotax would like it to stay that way. I'm not saying bitcoin shouldn't be taxed but there are bigger fish to fry.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:53:24
+1 for cash app. They price the bitcoin a little higher than other exchanges but there aren't transfer fees. You'd have to do the math to figure out if it ends up being cheaper or not but I personally prefer paying a higher price without the fees. Its also very easy to use. One thing to keep in mind, after doing the KYC with your driver's license/account info it might take a while to confirm you. I had to wait about a week before I was able to buy more than $50 dollars worth of btc. 
In the future I'll be looking into using an exchange that doesn't do KYC such as bisq since I'm of the opinion that KYC doesn't reduce crime and excludes a lot of people from participating in the space. Money shouldn't be the LEO arm of the government. The problem is that diving into anonymizing yourself takes a bit of time, effort, and research right now.

Not on cash app. It's more expensive than the average market price but there are no transfer fees.
EDIT: Hypothetically let's say we're doing DDCA. You load up $70 on sunday and start buying $10 worth every day. Well price drops to 9k on monday. Would you spend the rest of the $60 on monday? Or continue the daily buy?

I've been trying to understand hashcash and proof of work with some struggle. From what I think I understand...
A hash is taking an input and putting it through a function to turn it into something else in a way that can't be turned back into the input. An analogy I saw was putting strawberries in a blender to make a strawberry smoothie.
Apparently it takes a lot of computational power to do it and in the case of hashcash the difficulty changes so that it should only take around 10 minutes. If it took more than 10 mins the difficulty is decreased, if it took less the difficulty is increased. 
The first miner to complete the hash gets to add a block to the chain? The block consists of transactions and the "header" of the block is the hash that they completed? Also, what are the inputs and outputs of the hash, are they just arbitrary? Do they mean anything or are just a way to make it purposely difficult to add blocks?

So basically the whale has a shitload of bitcoin and if they were to sell a bunch of it the price would drop.
Now they made a bet with CME saying, "I bet you x amount of money that the bitcoin price will not be more than $9000 on Tuesday, Sept 24th 2019". When that date actually rolled around and they were about to lose the bet, they sell enough BTC to drop the price below $9000 and suddenly win the bet. 
It works out in two ways too because a bunch of people panic sold and now the price is closer to $8000. So when the whale buys back what they had to sell to win the bet, bitcoin is cheaper than what they sold it at. Making them even more money.
Is that how it works?

People will use anything for any reason. If you focus on what everyone else is using that thing for, you'll continue to be confused. Bitcoin offers options. It's not only about price or only about the technology or only about something else.
