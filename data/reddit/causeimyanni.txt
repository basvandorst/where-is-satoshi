woahhh cool!

Hey - absolutely! We're using BitPay and Coinbase as our payment processors - alleviates us with all of the risk ATM.
For large purchases (anything above $10K) we ask for identification for AML and KYC regulations.
But other than that, we have a very health relationship with our bank(s) and have not had any issues yet. Even if our accounts "freeze" all products are paid for within twenty minutes of you sending the BTC... meaning that your product is already purchased.
Let me know if you have any more questions - you can always reach us at mail
Thank you so much!

It depends, but for the most part yes it will include rent! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:13:08
Correct, but we're working on a work around for this :) Should have more news about this in a couple days.
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:44:56
Already service China! :)
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:21:35
Yanni here :D - we're ordering away!
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:43:37


@_date: 2014-01-16 00:21:07
Yup, we've had order from NZ. If the website ships to you, then we can handle the order.
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:30:31
Hey, I pasted a list here: 
If the website ships to you, we can ship to you. We also recently started reshipping services - where we ship the product here and ship out to a different address that the website doesn't service. Not a main priority, but it's something that a lot of people have asked for. More information to come for that :)
Let me know if this helps. Thanks!

Hey, sorry about that.  It's important to note that we do NOT store wallets on our database/website. We simply send you an invoice that you can pay on your own time from whatever wallet you choose.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:42:58


Nope. We're charging a flat $10 fee for this service.
Let me know if this makes sense! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:41:10
Although I tend to agree w/ not storing your wallet to dropbox, there are things that you can do to secure your dropbox.

Yanni from snapCard here :) Really had a great time completing this purchase - thanks for the post  WOW, I still can't believe how awesome that car is.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:12:51
BitPay or Coinbase... depends what payment method you choose on our website.
Thanks for the question!

Hey, Yanni here from snapCard. We understood that this may be a concern to many people so we ended up launching an invoicing option. You order the product and then we send you an invoice (BitPay) where you can pay using your wallet.
Let me know if you have any more questions.
 - it's coming soon!
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:10:51

Hey! Yanni here from Snapcard. 
The bookmarklet business was some really good fun! Mike's 100% correct - we've pivoted a bit ago. We posted a video about the entire "Bookmarklet" product and how we started!
[Check it out]( if you haven't already.

@_date: 2013-11-25 22:51:24
snapCard is all for this! We have some really cool things that will help us [hopefully :) ] not become obsolete.
Thank you for all of your comments!

hey, thanks for the questions.
We have two options, (1) attach your coinbase account to be automatically debited for the transaction, or (2) receive an invoice within 5 minutes of the order processing. You will receive an address for the order that you can pay however you'd like.. So nope, you don't need a coinbase account! :)

Hey! This is Yanni from snapCard. I designed those ads. Definitely not trying to suggest anything about the people in the bitcoin community/subreddit page.
Typically I just design things that I think are funny. So if ANYTHING make fun of me because I like memes. YOU GOT ME :(
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:59:39
hey! you forgot about things like gyft ( &amp; snapcard (
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:18:00
Hey, send us an e-mail at mail We'll take a look to see if we can get this re-applied. Thanks for the comment!

When I heard the news this week I was literally jumping up and down!! 
Booked a trip back home using BTC! AMAZING. :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:26:30
Actually, I noticed that it was just you! So, a very big THANK YOU to you.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:20:48
great work guys!
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:06:10
Gyft has a great rewards program (and an excellent product). What we do is a little different. You can automatically buy anything on the Internet using your Bitcoins... not just focused on gift cards.
You're correct though, the 2% transaction fee is added on top of your order. We're looking at ways to decrease this :)
Thank you for your comments!
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:10:17
Hey, did you try 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:29:01

We agree! See my comments to  -&gt; he/she mentioned something similar.

But, Gyft is awesome too!

Oh no! I'm going to look into that! Thank you for the comments!
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:03:01
Hey jerguismi, you're right this is currently a waiting list.  We've built a working model (as shown in the video) and should have a beta out by the end of the month.  My name is Yanni, I'm a product guy here at snapCard.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:05:28
We're working on it! Should be there within the next two weeks!
Thanks for the question!
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:11:14
Thank you :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:11:01
AWESOME! Thank you sooo much!

this is so cool! Good work everybody!
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:09:33
Hey, this is Yanni from snapCard. Just came across this post! Thanks everyone for the comments. Really appreciate it.
 thanks for the comment! Our service is definitely not the first one out there, thanks for pointing that out! I believe we're all working towards the same goal though :)
It's important to note that there are a few things that are different with snapCard. (1) I believe our fees are less expensive than any other service out there. (2) We take customer service very seriously... We have live customer support where the founders are in charge of. (3) Our shopping experience is a little different than other services - it's more (4) We're backed by a great investor that's heavily invested in the Bitcoin community.
"Works on every website" might be too "markety"... I just changed it :) You're absolutely right... our bookmarklet doesn't work on every website... BUT we're trying really hard to fix this.
Ping me on chat if you want to talk about the product! Cheers!
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:25:50
Thank you both for the comments and errors. Fixing them now!
