yes rvem, it makes me feel worse that those bitcoin were sitting happily in my Trezor for years. I would look in only occasionally to check up on them. :)
There was an emotional attachment too. I now feel like someone who has traded in his adorable babies for some bastardized devil-children with 666 engraved on their foreheads !
Anyway, it is what it is; what's done is done. I genuinely only posted to try and deter anyone else from being duped into exchanging their bitcoin for junk.

Nik, what they were saying did seem to be corroborated and substantiated by the ( at the time) increasing value of Bcash and the plummeting price of Bitcoin.
I was beguiled and persuaded both by the r/btc shilling and the market movements.

I not a tech-savvy guy, I'm embarrassed to admit ................. so I really didn't understand the engineering arguments for or against. 
I just got spooked by the dropping price of BTC and the corresponding rise in Bcash. And in conjunction,  I swallowed the propaganda over at r/btc hook-line-and-sinker.

Yes Womble, I had an amount from the fork. 
But I also went all-in to Bcash on top as well because, like, you know, they told me legacy Bitcoin was ded. DED, they said.

goody, I didn't see them as scammers at the time. I was bewitched, I saw them as good actors in the space -- fool that I was. It has to be said that they do "talk a good game". It can be persuasive because it is so repetitive over there.
Now that I have taken the red pill, I can see what the truth is .......... and what is the lies.

Yes indeed, that is a consolation.
They still believe the bullshit. Even as and whilst they are losing money hand-over-fist.

Transferred my Bitcoin to Polo on November 9th when it was around $5,900. It took a day or so to transfer and be credited. Three days later converted BTC to Bcash at a rate of approx B0.29.

Many thanks, Burglar. That's great. Much obliged to you, indeed.

Gents, may I ask ............
Would a hard fork, if it were to come to pass, happen suddenly or would there be advance notice of same. And if so, what kind of timeframe of notice before happening would we be given?

Could somebody ELI5 why you consider it a "given" that Chinese investors are gonna divest themselves of Bitcoin in light of the coming exchange ban? Is it not equally possible that the same Chinese investors would HODL their coin seeing as it will be far more difficult to buy them post-Sept30? In fact, is it not feasible that Chinese folk might be predisposed to buying even more coin while they still can?

Careful how you tread if considering that bitcoin-a-trade platform.
It does not enjoy great reputational standing.
If something seems too good to be true, then, it usually is.
