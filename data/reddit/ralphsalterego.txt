I don’t know much myself but a friend was purchasing for me and while we were purchasing we hesitated for a few seconds before initiating the buy. Upon initiating the buy, coinbase said the exchange rate had changed so the amount we had to pay for the same amount of crypto changed.

1) An exchange is where you buy/sell cryptocurrencies. A wallet is where you keep cryptocurrencies you’ve bought or have received.
2) No, an exchange cannot be a wallet. However exchanges usually come with a wallet. 
Coinbase, for instance, is an exchange and the account you create with them already comes with a wallet from them. This wallet is controlled by you but “owned” by them. I say owned because if they’re website crashes you have no access to “your wallet”. That’s why most people suggest you create a wallet using example [MyEtherWallet](myetherwallet.com)  where you are in complete control.
3) No. You need an exchange or interface to send or purchase cryptocurrencies. However you don’t need any of these to receive cryptocurrencies from someone who is sending to your wallet address. You don’t even need to be online. It’s rather that person who needs the interface to send to you.

This looks like some corporate bullshit. It’s like wallstreet wants to short it and you can only join the club if you want to bet against them. 
I think bitcoin is low enough now for you to go long though.

Yes. Your wallet only stores your crypto. It’d just be a reference point for the exchanges telling them that send x amount from wallet 111 to wallet 222. Or you buy a crypto and instruct them to deposit in wallet 111.
These would explain in more detail.

The process to transfer your fiat would begin even when the other hasn’t yet gone through. If by some reason, not caused by you, the order fails they’d need an account to return the funds to. I think you’d be at a greater risk if you removed your bank account.

Yes it happens when the system is down. you can check the status [here]( It’s working fine for me though.

Most of the top 10 cryptos generally follow bitcoins movement closely. However this past week it was all mayhem, bitcoin was sucking in all the other cryptos. Today it looks like other coins are back to following bitcoins reach to all time high, although bitcoin is going down now.
Edit: I think I answered a different question. The rates do not match up exactly because the exchanges also use demand for that currency to determine prices. USD is the most fluid.

[GDAX]( , it’s owned by Coinbase.

You need miners to compute your transaction. I doubt there’s another way.

There is a backlog of transactions. They will process the most rewarding transactions first. That’s why if you want your transaction to go through quickly you should be paying a higher fee to jump the queue.

I’m wearing red, is that fine?

Sorry, all “experts” are unavailable at this moment. There seems to be a correction in their predictions.
Just kidding, trust no one, trust your guts. When you bleed you bleed alone, when you lambo you lambo alone.

a contract for assets (in this case Bitcoin) bought at agreed prices but delivered and paid for later.
So if I entered into a $15,000 March 2018 Bitcoin futures contract with you, I agree to pay $15k in March 2018 for 1 bitcoin from you no matter the market price of bitcoin. You also agree to sell at this price no matter what.
If the price in March is $20k, I’ve made a gain of 5000 because I can buy at 15000 from you and sell immediately on the market for 20000.
If the price in March is $10k. You would make a gain of 5000 because you can sell to me at $15k when the market would have bought from you at just 10000.
