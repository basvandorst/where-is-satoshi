If you're not a fan of reading, as I am, there are a lot of youtube clips by Eckhart Tolle, Adyashanti and Robert Adams on youtube. Essentially they all talk about the same thing; living 100% in the present moment.
If you dont mind reading, Eckhart Tolle has a great book called ["The Power of Now"](

I'm not qualified to correctly answer this, but I don't think Moore's law has anything to do with that. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Apparently you'd need a 256-qbit quantum computer to do that. If I recall correclty, currently, the best one is less than 20-qbit.

Maybe people will think the bullrun has started. It'll rise above what the billionaire pumps it to.

What's an example of a controlled risk? Isn't that the same as manipulation?

This was before the crash. Sometime in 2012. Bought at under $8. Got scammed by fake MtGox support. Did sell some right before, so didn't lose any $.

1000 BTC to MtGox back in the day.

Fiat currency is never lost to scammers or stolen.

I lost a total of 1000 BTC to mt gox back in the day. First I got scammed, then the second time when they got hacked. I didn't get back into crypto until 2 months ago.

I hope that btc/crypto will be the preferred payment method for everything in the future. That I could by groceries etc.
I'll just hold everything (on my private wallets) until then.

Lost faith in it. Kept kicking myself all the time when it kept rising. 
"What if I still had my BTC, would've been rich. Eh, no use. Not worth getting back in."

Does that mean you'll get a 2X wallet at coinbase, as well as your original BTC wallet? With the same amount of BTC that you already have?

I mined with my GPU in 2011. Somewhat of a difference, no?
