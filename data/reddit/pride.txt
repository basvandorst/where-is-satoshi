Sure people looking to buy things off the record would hardly be affected, but the government would tout bitcoins officially as helping gangster, drug dealers and "terrorist".... completely squashing all legitimate use - that is beneficial.

Questions I have for the general reddit community.
How can I tell how many people are selling there bitcoins in a given day. I took a quick gander at the stats of the homepage - but want sure if I am looking in the right place to see sales / buying volume.
If I had 1000 bitcoins, what would be the best way of redeeming cash for them? Selling them on Mt.Gox, or trying to exchange for gift/visa cards?

wait. 36000 cards ontop of the usual demand for gaming hardware is quite significant to me - even more so that not a drop has gone to Nvidia presumably. 
I don't think total income on the cards is that impressive. in that regard this is insignificant. The biggest advantage AMD now has is cleaning up all of there old stock - forcing gamers to buy newer 6xxx and 7xxx series gpu's when they come available
@_date: 2011-06-12 06:45:03
and you don't think people would do that if they put in a 15$ buy order (bitcoins are at 10.4 atm)
or even a bunch of small ~11$ orders as to not look like a single entity 
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:51:24
I agree, but its something to look into.
I will be sticking to bitcoins, interesting analysis however.
One last thought: I would argue that cards bought on craigslist still creates demand for newer cards purchased at retail...
@_date: 2011-06-14 02:57:17
every 5xxx card is gone. Plus who would want the 5 series when the 6 series are vastly oversold (even if they dont sell out) and the 7xxx are on the market?
Secondarily, the scenario is if bitcoins go bust...if they go bust like they could have done this weekend there would be no pre-warning, just 30$ then down to 0...would create such an influx on gpu's there is no way the number of gamers in the market for new hardware would ever absorb that.

I think the divisibility of bitcoins will through a kink in that idea. When they are divisible by a billion, there is no real demand for anything.  if 0.0000001 bitcoin (a satoshi) equaled a penny - then from that point you would see price grow based on supply.
Right now price rises or falls based on whole bitcoins, but once people are used to spending .005 bitcoins the price will just shift

xeons will give you nothing.
Just needing the video cards will mean you might be saving $100.
The cpu requirements are so low for mining. MicroCenter has a sale on motherboard processor combos that were going for ~100$ (4pci slots)
- all you need is a 700 watt power supply 
 + 20$ worth of ram....
6950 video cards, which are about the best you can find right now - are 250 - 295 a pop.
@_date: 2011-06-12 01:36:32
which would kill bitcoins use as a currency, cause people to start holding it as an investment. Then you could constantly buy and sell your 1$Million and cause the market to fluctuate and shift so much, pricing anything in bitcoins would be meaningless.

Thanks for the input, I have yet to start mining anything - but I guess ill get to understand how the pools differ. What are the biggest improvements MtRed needs?
@_date: 2011-06-08 13:04:12
why has all this capability joined deepbit? Is it just , "everyone else does it" type of mentality?
Why don't we talk more about our own mining team? [r/mtred]( (have hardware on the way and seriously need some understanding here)
As a bitcoin miner, you would like your bitcoins to remain valuable as well as you investment in time and equipment. The last thing I could see someone wanting, is for DeepBit to be able to do something crazy with the currency.... why would a miner even be a part of DeepBit as they approached 50% is beyond me.
@_date: 2011-06-08 14:57:52
but variance over time - week/month tends towards a constant?
do you mine with Mt.Red? How active is its development (as I am starting to gather, development of a suite of apps and add-ons is the biggest draw for a particular group)

@_date: 2013-03-06 11:57:31
I think the concern is that someone is pumping and dumping, or simply trying to disrupt bitcoins by buying and selling repeatedly.
If someone is simply buying and holding...then they are more or less just investing in bitcoins. Someone buying with the intention of selling (assuming they put in a significant portion of the market cap) is the problem
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:37:27
sure, but someone pumping and dumping repeatedly could greatly disrupt bitcoin's adoption...or like we are seeing now - cause the price to spike and then plummet quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:46:39

You could sell your bitcoins on mtgox - then cash out on bitinstant - which will send money to paypal.
