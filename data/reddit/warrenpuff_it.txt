you have no one to blame for a wrongful purchase other than yourself, either throw in the towel or stfu and learn from your mistakes. im long bitcoin, but to go on the internet and complain about it instead of taking action and progressing is retarded. how about you sell them, and have a stiff upper lip about it. or how about you hold them, and stfu anyways. what did you hope to gain by whining? someone to come along and assure you it will recover? or someone with privy knowledge to explain to you what all the charts mean and economic trends? nobody held a gun to your head and said ''buy these at this price, or else!'' you had a reason for buying them at that time for that price, or did you just blindly hop into a fiat currency with pipedreams of making it big off something you didnt understand? why not sell them, put that money into ANY OTHER CURRENCY, and have the same results? at least then you cant blame bitcoins, you'd be able to lay your blame in a countries government, so you wouldnt feel as bad about buying something you didnt understand in the first place. if you did understand, you wouldnt be whining about the price, you would have owned up to your decisions.
