I don't care, I haven't even sold during the spike. Most of my coins are for long term storage... like I said I cashed most of them during 2017 top so I have more than enough FIAT to last years ;)

Let's revisit this thread in 30 days.

What is your electric rate?
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:41:23
No worries my friend =)

The thing is that most western people have lived all their lives in a very peaceful/safe environement.
For exemple, peoples in Latin America understand the use much easier than us since their currencies always are printed to oblivion.
What western people fail to realise it that we're currently sitting at the top of a monstrous house a card, ready to blow anytime.

Yes, I've been sharing it to friend and family. Only thing I am not 100% in line with him is that he should put more correlation with the Halving cycle.

This is my business Reddit.
We're running an insect farm heating with ASIC miners.

The salt is real my friend.

Well, I can see wealthy individual edging the market.
Also, there is the 4 year cycle (part of halving cycle);
Seriously, I don't know what is going on... very bizarre.

Go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for this all to blow over.

Bitcoin is nothing new I agree but most people still don't understand it's concept and uses.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:17:32
Do you have any links supporting this?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:41:26
Depends if you sold a major portion of your stack at \~15,000$ ;)
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:54:56
Yeah, there are lots of industrial processes that could uses BTC's heat. I find it pretty counter productive to pay for cooling or dump the heat outside when you can use it.

Most people don't eat the powder/crickets raw, they make recipe with them. It taste pretty blend so it takes the flavor you give it. NAAK makes amazing bar, you should check them out. [

I was skeptic at first when my partner pitched the idea to me. After reading UN's report I was sold. 
You should really try a cricket protein bar, some of them taste delicious. The one I personally tested where from: [

@_date: 2019-01-20 23:28:04
Yeah, got some good old S9 for next to nothing. Electricity is dirt cheap in Quebec too, 0.05$USD/kw so I should be able mine for a while.

Thanks for the info, I need to get grammerly ASAP. Making these updates in 3 languages is killing me.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:39:46
Yeah, it kinda is. Get a while to get use too. Fortunately, the product we want to sell is the powder/protein bar =)

At some point in the future, steak will be considered a luxury.
You should have a look at this: 
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:54:30
Clever idea, will try to set it up at some point.
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:57:50
Are you located near Montreal ?
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:59:00
Mining is only going to be \~10% of our projected revenues. Bitcoin price could go to 250$ and we'd still mine since we have to heat them at 30c.
We do have a plan but to be quite honest it still is a new industry so we're in the unknown for lots of things. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:12:26
We never know.

There are 3 big reasons why I don't think it is viable in our situation:
1) Quebec doesn't receive enough lights per annum
2) Electricity is the cheapest in North America
3) I don't know anyone with expertise in this field, probably due to those two reasons above
Fortunately, roughly 97% of Quebec's power come from renewable, hydro-electric barrages. Great idea nonetheless.

@_date: 2019-01-20 23:29:24
Cheers mate !  
We can always use some help, where are you located ?  
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:24:56
Never heard of them.
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:52:35
Amazing name mate, you should TM it right now =)
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:55:23
My pleasure =)
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:57:06
Yes, it absolutely is ! 
We don't want to heat using anything fossil fuel related &amp; electricity is cheap.
