Virtual machine, yo. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:49:34
Hmmm ok thanks. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:33:56
Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:37:04
Yeah, I'm sure you're right. They responded on Reddit pretty promptly, so fingers crossed!
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:48:46
Huh, that's a possibility. Thanks!

Hmm, and if they reassign my phone number because it's been inactive too long, I'm just fucked? Fortunately I don't need that money for travel funds -- but it's frustrating to lose access like that.

Hey man, no need to be a dick. I'm not storing the bulk of my coins there; I just wanted to use gdax because I didn't trust bitfinex. I'm mostly hoping this gets their attention so I can get this resolved. Thanks for the "help."

Will do -- thanks, Rosie!

TFW I appreciate a post but I'm afraid to upvote in case it looks like vote manipulation and gets the whole thread blocked.

I mean, sure, it's not optimal. Can you suggest a better alternative if I want to place limit orders?
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:28:44
I guess all I have is anecdotal evidence, but everyone I talked to seemed to be in favor of it. It's possible that opinion is souring now that the economic impacts are more evident, but I didn't hear anyone speak unfavorably of the move while I was there. Just a lot of "yes, it's an inconvenience but I think it will be good for India."

I can certainly see why. I'm in India right now, and the Prime Minister just announced that all 500 and 1000 rupee bills (the current highest denominations) would cease to be legal tender at the end of December. Total surprise. People have until then (or March with an extension) to trade in their old bills for smaller denominations. New high-denom bills will be printed "soon." We waited in line at the bank today to get rid of 1000 rupee bills that no one wants to take and it was nuts.
A good reminder that fiat is really only worth anything as long as a government says it's worth something....

The Indian PM, Modi, announced last month with no warning that, effective immediately, the two highest-value bills (500 rupees and 1000 rupees) were no longer legal tender. Everyone thus has spent the following weeks in line at banks to exchange old bills for lower denominations and at atms to withdraw usable cash. I was there for two weeks if it and it was rough. The population on the whole agrees with the move, as it will punish many rich people with piles of cash sitting around as unreported, untaxed "black money," but it's a clusterfuck now and has hurt their economy in the short term. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 01:06:07
Yeah, everyone is waking out of the bank with these fat stacks of cash that only total like $40.

I'm against 2x, personally, but I find it funny that if this were UASF the angle would be more like "UASF has reached 30% support!"
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:00:07
I would rephrase it as "don't put in what you *can't afford* to lose. I don't *want* to lose $100, but I wouldn't be totally screwed if I did.

I love this! But is there any reason you've made it so hard to pay with btc? I have to connect my FB and deposit coins....why not just give me an address to send my bits to? Also, the option to change name and photo in the user account settings do not seem to work. Anyway, I really do love what you're doing here.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:16:05
Yeah, I thought it was just my phone. For a few days I thought the price had just completely stabilized lol. I don't know how to fix it, though.

Seems like the title is saying the opposite: that the Ledger represents self-sovereignty, as opposed to the status quo of relying on the government's monetary system.
