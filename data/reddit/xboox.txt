Joe Biden is supposed to be the creepy one in this campaign, what with his stories of children playing with his leg hair at the pool and munching on his wife’s finger and all, but ABC News managed to catch 2020 candidate Andrew Yang celebrating the opening of his Manchester, New Hampshire campaign office by playing with some whipped cream and what we assume are staffers.

A couple of AFP officers stopped at a property west of Canberra and talked to an old Aboriginal standing on the road. He told the old Aboriginal, "Morning sir, I need to inspect this land for illegally grown drugs."  
The elder reluctantly said, "okay, but don't go into that field over there...", as he nodded his head towards the location.  
The AFP officer verbally exploded &amp; said, "Look sir, I have the authority of the federal government with me!". Reaching into his rear back pocket, the AFP officer removed his badge &amp; proudly displayed it to the old Aboriginal. "See this badge?! This badge means I can go wherever I want, whenever I want................on any land! No questions asked, no answers given! Do you understand mate?"  
The elder nodded kindly, apologized &amp; went about his business. Moments later he heard loud - fearful screams; he looked up &amp; saw the AFP officer running for his life, being chased by a large Bull. With every step the Bull was gaining ground on the officer &amp; it was likely that he'd sure enough get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified. The old Aboriginal threw down his tools &amp; ran as fast as he could to the fence &amp; yelled at the top of his lungs...... "YOUR BADGE! SHOW HIM YOUR FUCKING BADGE!"

Crypto ICOs as the new railway bonds
By: Izabella Kaminska  
    It was now that there began the systematic practice of stagging — applying heavily for the shares in new companies with a view to selling them immediately at a premium — and Punch that year had plenty of fun satirising ‘Stag-hunting in Capel Court”.  
That’s from David Kynaston’s City of London: The History.  
It refers to the railway mania of the 1840s, an investment bubble that collapsed in 1846 after a corn drought forced the Bank of England to raise rates. The hike put an abrupt end to the preceding period of excessively cheap money, which eventually meant more than a third of the railways the government authorised were never built. According to Wikipedia:  
    …the companies either collapsed due to poor financial planning, were bought out by larger competitors before they could build their line, or turned out to be fraudulent enterprises to channel investors’ money into other businesses.  
A related factoid from Kynaston is that by the peak of the frenzy hardly any resources were needed to set up a railway firm venture: “A solicitor or two, a civil engineer, a Parliamentary agent, possibly a contractor, a map of England, a pair of compasses, a pencil, and a ruler, were all that were requisite to commence the formation of a railway company.”  
The lawyers and contractors servicing the needs of the boom were in the end the ones to really profit from the mania.  
That was then, but what about now?  
Well, now we have the latest fad that has gripped the cryptocurrency community: the near-exponential rise of the initial coin offering, informally known as the “ICO”.  
Judging by this reporter’s inbox, ICOs are now propagating at an unprecedented rate, fuelled in part by the cheapness of setting up such systems and in part by the growing abundance of unmaterialised paper profits in the sector. To the casual observer’s eye, all that’s needed to make an ICO investment “a go” is a website, a white paper, a PR agent, and possibly a coder. The reward? Potentially unlimited access to a pool of similarly contrived liquidity already circulating through informal dark economy. The fact much of this funding — due to the growing complexity of cashing it into the official realm — lies trapped within a closed informal network does little to quash the appeal of the investment case.  
The rhetoric is also uncannily similar. Crypto offerings are not investment schemes based on vapourware: they’re opportunities to invest in the digital rails of the new decentralised financial system.  
Admittedly there is one notable difference between now and then: the glaring absence of staggers (also known as flippers). For now at least the majority of ICO investors tend to be — or are certainly being encouraged to be — buy-and-hold-forever investors, content with mark-to-market valuations for their riches. Whether the smart money is thinking the same is yet to be determined.  
What the dynamic undoubtedly does echo is what Keynes reflected upon in his 1919 opus Economic Consequences of the Peace in connection to the sort of investor temperament that drove the foundations of the industrial economy:  
    The new rich of the nineteenth century were not brought up to large expenditures, and preferred the power which investment gave them to the pleasures of immediate consumption. In fact, it was precisely the inequality of the distribution of wealth which made possible those vast accumulations of fixed wealth and of capital improvements which distinguished that age from all others. Herein lay, in fact, the main justification of the Capitalist System. If the rich had spent their new wealth on their own enjoyments, the world would long ago have found such a régime intolerable. But like bees they saved and accumulated, not less to the advantage of the whole community because they themselves held narrower ends in prospect.  
With regards to railways specifically, his pointed reference to pyramids (ahem) is also worth noting:  
    The immense accumulations of fixed capital which, to the great benefit of mankind, were built up during the half century before the war, could never have come about in a Society where wealth was divided equitably. The railways of the world, which that age built as a monument to posterity, were, not less than the Pyramids of Egypt, the work of labor which was not free to consume in immediate enjoyment the full equivalent of its efforts.  
    Thus this remarkable system depended for its growth on a double bluff or deception. On the one hand the laboring classes accepted from ignorance or powerlessness, or were compelled, persuaded, or cajoled by custom, convention, authority, and the well-established order of Society into accepting, a situation in which they could call their own very little of the cake that they and Nature and the capitalists were co-operating to produce. And on the other hand the capitalist classes were allowed to call the best part of the cake theirs and were theoretically free to consume it, on the tacit underlying condition that they consumed very little of it in practice. 
The idea industrial progress was built on the pyramidal foundations of the fundamentally frugal certainly gives hope to the notion that the crypto phenomenon is about more than just Ponzi-style profiteering.  
The more sceptical mind, however, would argue that at least with railways something of a real problem was being resolved. Furthermore, its decentralised ambition was bounded in the physical limitations of centralised practicality. There were, after all, only so many railways that could compete on servicing the same route, and only so long until the efficiency of a centralised approach became self evident.  
Whether the same realisation will ever penetrate the crypto-blockchain sector, however, is another matter entirely. Decentralisation (not rail building) is the investment fad’s de facto raison d’être. Accordingly, if a centralised or oligopolistic approach to the new virtual system was ever deemed preferable from a cost, efficiency and user experience perspective, we’d only be back at square one.  
What’s more, unlike the railway investment boom, which at least allowed surviving parties to inherent potentially useful legacy track, what we’ve got here in the best case scenario is the handover of claims, upon claims, upon claims, upon… illegitimate claims — anchored as most of them are in the economic profits of the dark economy, which are not supposed to be recognisable due to their value destroying nature.

@_date: 2017-05-30 14:59:08
We get 2-4 times the throughput with SegWit alone - early autumn of 2017.  
Lightning works on Litecoin! Real money, see??? It's the same thing.  
But if you find bugs in LN on Litecoin (good luck heh) - take a year to solve them while 2-4MB SegWit  Bitcoin blocks keep us going.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:53:31
Ostracism is the primary tool of peaceful voluntarists!!!  
Loving it.  
Competition is coming once **UASF** and SegWit shut down covert exploits.  
I suspect this office will be shut down as well at the end of summer = plan ahead!

I'm super excited about the approaching SegWit activation, freeing block space, clearing up the mempool, removing congestion === BIP148 here we come! We are over 1,000 UASF nodes now!
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:44:21
Ahhh don't say that Jihan. You were the inspiration !
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:39:30
Ignore that.  
We need all the above - open support tickets at Bitcoin exchanges, wallets. E-mail, twitter.  
Run a full enforcing node.  
Add your support to uacomment.
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:50:46
If you don't move your coin - no issues at all.  
But if you want 2-3 times the capacity and correspondingly the price -- run the UASF BIP148 now!  
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:15:20
Key part of Bitcoin economy (at least in the olden days) could use some tutoring: 
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:47:05

@_date: 2017-05-21 14:40:10
Great!  
You can signal support for our effort via a simple comment in the .conf file **right now**:   
Running a full enforcing node may be documented here, though the site is a bit behind: 
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:21:23
We are nudging weak willed miners to signal for SegWit with the help of **UASF**, that's all folks.
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:12:38
Like... to make it seem like they are still relevant in protocol functionality decisions?  
I would and *fast* since the longer they delay the greater of a chance all future upgrades will be done via unconditional **UASF**.
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:18:41
And he's got a great taste in hats too!  
  
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:21:51
We could've had SegWit many months ago, but finally businesses are waking up to move forward with BIP148. Thank god  
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:45:22
A lot of good links here: 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:05:47
I don't think it matters, but I'm not 100% sure.  
What is important is to run UASF BIP148 nodes to encourage miners to seriously signal for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:41:58
I suspect it's a good-cop bad-cop routine :P
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:20:21
An exchange pretending to remain "neutral" is completely reckless and will actually lose customer's money:   
There is no "neutral": it's SegWit which 90%+ of nodes support already vs China-coin.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:21:11
Don't forget to verify the sigs:  
  
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:58:03
About freaking time!  
Been waiting for SegWit since last December...
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:46:27
Thanks guys! :D  
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:00:20
I will welcome our chinese brothers back to sanity once SegWit locks in this summer.  
And not judge their sexual preferences. :D
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:47:11
I hope someone respected will stand up and give the users a choice of a BIP148/UASF pool **right now** or soon...  
?  
?  
People are already asking to make their intent known via pooled mining. I understand enforcement will not begin until summer. Thanks
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:38:54
At minimum please signal support for UASF with the simple comment:   
Then tryp  for full enforcing node information.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:31:42
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:38:23
And this: 
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:33:37
Do not forget the "prune=" option if you're on the SD card.
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:01:57
Never again (will a mining cartel hold us hostage) !  
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:19:44


And we all know who "activates" SegWit, by signalling it.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:43:13
The PoW algo change is in the works as well = should Bitmain attempt more remote exploits of customer machines.  
That would be a suicide move for the biggest ASIC manufacturer (total pool annihilation and every customer/investor with a class action lawsuit at his door). 
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:04:21
No fight, just another incentive for miners to hurry with SegWit activation, along with the price - isn't that nice?  
The price which will double (again) this summer! All they need is a little nudge.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:23:30
You will once Lightning (LN) goes live.  
You'll get paid for providing a Lightning channel &amp; liquidity.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:51:58
This is huge, if your analysis is correct!  
Because I would think (at the minimum) all SegWit signalling miners will be mining the SegWit/UASF chain day 1, which is 30+% TODAY.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:18:37
Key user base &amp; services from the olden days live here, give them some love: 
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:11:43
Good point it'll take you a day to find out you were wrong/stupid for mining the old non-SegWit Legacy chain :P  
(You'll find out when you try selling those coins - a day is loooooooooong time in bitcoinland).
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:45:09
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:41:29
And of course, any (custody of funds) business that does not support BIP148 is criminally negligent and will be facing lawsuits by the end of summer: 
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:20:12
Are you running UASF on **your** nodes?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:20:57
Correct - they better assure customers they will not lose their funds: 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:04:07
Very nice.  
Miners will activate and finally signal SegWit by August. Great news!  
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:43:26

@_date: 2017-05-30 16:00:48
At minimum criminally negligent.

They confuse the masses, delay progress by years, while bringing 0 (or less) to the table:

'cause they got too much power and no shame?
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:52:50
Of course they wouldn't mine that shit!  
But they want YOU to direct your miners there, so that they have better hashrate % on the real Bitcoin chain. :) :) :)
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:17:11
False.  
Hashpower is there to order TXs I freely send into a **valid** block. If the current cartel of miners fails (fork off or some such BS) - there are many to take their place to earn the sweet reward.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:01:59

UAHF is a fake (term).  
Only miners can fork (their job is to extend the chain). Miners can fork any time btw.   
I wouldn't base my investment decisions on a blurb written by who knows whom, unsigned, in which even the very first word is a lie. But that's just me.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:41:15
Move to Coinomi first (then to Coinbase if you desire), they need a signature from the destination wallet to prove you own that destination address.
Kinda prudent actually.

You got less than 2 months to get a clear answer from your wallet providers &amp; exchanges on how they plan to handle this UASF SegWit activation.  
  
Or lawyer up and sue them for criminal negligence after the fact.

The mining pools/operators with the biggest share of the rate might as well turn OFF their machines on August 1st -- they are the ones to lose the most mining, useless blocks!  
Save some electricity...  
It just so happens that the miners with the highest share are why we're in this mess in the first place. Karma is a bitch.

Look at what happened with Coinbase losing customers' ETC. They had to pay for it out of their pocket. Not much, tens of thousands.  
If they lose BIP148-SegWit coins or the legacy coins -- they'll have to reimburse millions or billions - you think any exchange executives will take that chance?????

That bullshit blog post was unsigned, anonymous.  
And the very 1st word was a lie to begin with!  
(There is no such thing as a UAHF, hard forks are miners extending the chain on the wrong block...)  
Though Bitmain cashed in handsomely shorting today I'm certain.

All those non-Bitcoin Qt (Core, Satoshi client) developments &amp; teams (XT,Classic,bcoin,extensionblocks,btc1) were vaporware, full of holes, not used by anyone, except for stalling &amp; propaganda.

I don’t understand the point of fiat. Why not just keep your money in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:44:33
This is stupid BS.  
Miners got too much control already, way too centralized.  
They (with friends) also control propaganda/media (Bitcoincom), spawn numerous development teams, contol the manufacturing/sale of chips, many centralized pools, cloud mining, and are slowly branching into exchanges (Bitpay,etc.)!

The odds are greatly in favor of the good guys!
75% winning chances, 25% = chain split possible.  
The evil side is facing 25% = chain split, 25% = stagnation and 50% = chance of the wipeout (yay!).
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:17:12
BIP148 can win for sure with 33% I thought. It's the legacycoin that is in constant danger of re-org.

The rules of the Soft Fork are such that the Legacy chain may get re-orged *any time* and the BIP148 = can not. As long as there is a single miner on BIP148 the legacy chain is in danger.

China news is finally good news for Bitcoin (SegWit UASF here we come!)
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:45:30
SegWit chain can't die.  
It is the legacy chain that will get re-orged by the SegWit (BIP148) chain.  
I don't thin Jihan is so stupid as to remain the only miner mining ChinaLegacyCoin after the split - instead of getting his usual 12.5-16 BTC/block reward = $30K, he'll be lucky to get a $100 for the worthless block. :)

UAHF is a fake term.  
Only miners can hard fork (continue the chain on the wrong block). Miners can also hard fork any time they want.
