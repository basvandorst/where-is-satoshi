Yes - this is already available on 
You can formulate whatever contract you like,
and once it is approved (approx within a day)
just wait for counterparty to bid against you :-)

    1) thanks
    2) for some reason - cant find it in the market
    3) was able to download and build from source
    4) question: when I try to request money - the generated address is strange and  bitcoin thinks it is invalid address
    Please advise?
    thanks
    
    Edit:
    I think I figured it out:
    
    In src/com/bitcoinandroid/ApplicationState.java
    change:
    boolean TEST_MODE = true;
    to:
    boolean TEST_MODE = false;
    
    otherwise it uses testnet not prodnet.
    Edit2:
    I was able to run it and sent myself 0.02BTC - which probably arrived over p2p - 
    it is showing as pending
    and it keeps twirling (I guess downloading missing part of blockchain?)
    Taking forever.
    Would be nice to know the status.

Problem is that for some odd reason - market sometimes does not let you download - saying that it is not compatible with my phone.
I know it is wrong - I built from source and it works.

     Sorry - I am on win/eclipse :-(
     But on win it is rather straight forward.
     Download and launch eclipse.
     Add a new proj.
     Select from existing source.
     Pick location with source.
     Make the change from testnet to prodnet.
     Hit Build.
     Plug in the phone with USB.
     Hit Run.
     It should install the app and copy the blockchain and launch it.

Also frequently they co-inside with psychologically-comfortable round numbers.

Please upload an apk for download.
Market thinks my device is not compatible, 
and I don't want to build from source again.

    Example:
    1) User1 and User2 enter into agreement.
    2) User1 sends 1000 USD by Paypal.
    3) User2 sends 10 BTC (or whatever the rate is).
    4) Both are happy and approve the transaction.
    5) User1 reverses payment through Paypal.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:42:41
It does not work with reversible payment methods (paypal etc)
Please comment?
