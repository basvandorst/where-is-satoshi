There is another way that the script wouldn't be safe. An online address generator could actually have millions of precomputed private/public key combinations and just choose one of those at random when you generate an address, but you can verify the script to see that this is not the case.

If you are referring to a totally anonymous cryptocurrency, in this case you'd be right, Monero is at the top. (Dash has Masternodes, which are kind of like third party mixers, so I don't count Dash).
You may interested in and which I think are both forks of Monero? Anyway, their goal is to improve Monero and CryptoNote technology with blockchain pruning techniques, which I think Monero could benefit from so we don't have another blocksize debate repeat in the future. I think that is Monero's only weakness is that its average transaction size is larger than Bitcoin's because of all the additional privacy features.

The bitcoins exist on the blockchain. At the time of a hard fork the blockchain is copied into two blockchains, so any bitcoins you have before the split exist on both chains. 
After the split though, since the rules are different in each chain, each chain will evolve differently. So if you transact on one blockchain, your coins won't move on the other blockchain.

Check out localbitcoins [volume]( as it is probably a more true measure of the health of the Bitcoin economy, as it is people voluntarily obtaining Bitcoin to exchange with one another for goods and services. And the volume is growing!
Reasons why people use Bitcoin include, anonymity (yes, cash gives anonymity but you can't transact with it online), ability to control their own money, and protection against inflation from their national currency (while the US doesn't have this problem, at the moment, other countries do, and Bitcoin is less volatile then for instance, Argentinian or Venezuelan currencies)

Bitcoin is already split into 100 million units called Satoshi. You don't have to buy a bitcoin, which is the standard unit of Bitcoin (1 bitcoin = 100 million Satoshis) You can buy any number of Satoshis in theory, but in practice the smallest number you can buy is 2100 Satoshis (about 1 penny).

No, you get two different sets of bitcoins, Bitcoin-A and Bitcoin-B, at first they are of equal value, but overtime one coin will probably overtake the other, as it is not profitable for miners to mine both chains, so the value of one the coins will quickly fall to zero, and the miners will just mine one chain. And then only one type of Bitcoin will be left, so it will just be called Bitcoin again. As said above, there could be a small window of opportunity where you trade one set of bitcoins for the other and profit. But it is a risk, how do you know whether Bitcoin-A (the small block bitcoins) or Bitcoin-B (the large block bitcoins) are more valuable?

Experts now estimate that Bitcoin could become the [6th largest world reserve currency]( Right now, the 6th largest world currency is the [Australian dollar]( which has a daily exchange volume of over [$400 Billion dollars a day]( (8% of the 5.3 Trillion dollars exchanged daily). Bitcoin is just reaching in the [hundreds of million dollars a day]( So Bitcoin is tiny right now, the daily volume would have to increase over 1000-fold to reach the six largest currency. The price would probably have to go up also by 1000-fold by that time. Since the current price is about $450, that would peg the future price in 2030, at about $450,000.
When I first heard about Bitcoin, I thought it was like "WoW" (World of Warcraft) Gold, or someother online currency that some internet geeks made up. But then I learned about some of its benefits and usefulness, anonymity, control over own money, hedge against inflation, and then released how BIG the currency market actually is, the gears clicked.

You are correct, Bitcoin is not currency, but it is money. It is a store of value, that you can exchange for something else. It is not currency because governments cannot print it (there is a fixed maximum amount)
@_date: 2015-09-14 18:02:54
That's when the FED is meeting to raise the interest rates or not.
If the FED raises rates, it's expected that asset prices will decrease because a tighter money supply means a single dollar is worth more. Lending money is more expensive, so less lending will happen, meaning less dollars in the economy. Bitcoin price goes down, but if prices crash too far and the economy collapses who knows what will happen.
If the FED implements a negative rate, your savings are not safe, this means banks can and will charge you for saving money. (Putting your money in Bitcoin protects you from this)
If the FED keeps rates at zero, and implements QE 4. That means they are putting even more money in the economy, and all asset prices will increase (Stocks, real estate, Bitcoin) Bitcoin price goes up.
@_date: 2015-09-19 16:58:32
If Bitcoin went to $60K per coin then the entire market cap would be over $1 Trillion dollars. There would be no need to sell them for US dollars at that point, since you could probably buy a house, car, anything with Bitcoin easily at that point.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:33:35
Removing the blocksize limit is actually taking Bitcoin back to its roots. Originally, there wasn't a limit, but Satoshi added one temporarily when Bitcoin was weak to prevent attacks to the blockchain. However that was when the blockchain was very small, now it's large why would we need to keep it? Seems like it was Satoshi's original vision to not have a limit anyway.

You don't actually store Bitcoins. Bitcoins are stored in what is like a virtual locker room. What you store is the key (private key) to your locker (public address). The locker has a mail slot where people can put bitcoins in your locker, but only the person with the private key can take them out. The private key is a 58 digit number. (in WIF format) You can write this number on a piece of paper or store it in a text file on a computer, USB drive, SD card, etc...
You can create your Bitcoin private key/address using bitaddress.org, which works offline. 1) save bitaddress.org to your computer, so you can use it offline. 2) take your computer offline. 3) create your wallet(key and address) using bitaddress.org 4) save that information to your SD card

One issue I have, what is the tax liability on this thing? I understand that you have to pay capital gains tax when you spend Bitcoin on goods (in the US). For the occasional Bitcoin purchase, like a graphics card on Newegg.com, you might be able to slip under the radar. But for people like me, who plan to use this card for every single purchase, I spend at least $20,000 or more in goods every year, that's a huge tax liability and accounting headache to keep track of all that spending.

If you zoom in on the Bitcoin, there's an illuminati symbol to the left of the B.
EDIT: That's not the normal Bitcoin logo (obviously) Which means The Economist added the "Eye of Providence" symbol *intentionally*

You have to spend Bitcoin to use the blockchain. That's how the technology works.
The value of the blockchain lies in its open ledger and security. Miners dedicate computing resources and electricity to provide security. These resources cost the miners money. Thus the miners need an incentive to keep "mining" (in other words: securing the network) Bitcoin provides this incentive as it costs Bitcoin to use the blockchain. (Sure, you can use the blockchain for "free", but transactions are prioritized by fee) And there are a limited number of these Bitcoins, which is why they have value.

"We're going to take the blockchain and put it on the rack. And stretch it, until all the bitcoins fall out"
