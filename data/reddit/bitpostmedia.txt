Well, at least they do use Bitcoin and spread information about it in various ways: via books, movies, work, communication etc. May be they're not improving the Bitcoin protocol, but promotion plays a role as well, doesn't it?

Here's the second part of Women in Bitcoin:

Quote from the article:
"Don’t give your breath explaining what a public ledger, difficulty or hash rate are. In fact, not so many people are good in mining. Just let her stick to the basics of consumption and do the whole investigation by herself.
You: Here is a private key to your new wallet. I deposited there 1 Bitcoin, which has a current market value of almost 400 USD. You can take it and use it on your own for anything you want.
She: That’s so sweet!"
So, that's one of the ways to do it, you're right! :)

Glad that you like it. High five! :)

We've got a journalist living in Amsterdam. She's made a range of live interviews with owners of places accepting Bitcoin. 
The article "Amsterdam as a hub for Bitcoin lifestyle" stands like an overview of Bitcoin-related opportunities in this wonderful city.
Of course, something may change with the time, but we do hope that all these cafés, barbershops, cinemas and companies continue accepting crypto.

Thanks for the feedback. You  know, when it comes to lists of places/people etc., it's hard to mention all of them. We had the same story with "Women in Bitcoin" article ( After publishing it, there were lots of people who said we hadn't included 7-8 more women. That's why we decided to make Vol.2 of this article. 
The story with cities repeats. That is why we'll be glad to get more info about the places to live on Bitcoin. Mail to team to share your experience or name more cities.

This is how it goes
@_date: 2014-10-31 12:11:48
I believe, we'll make a Vol.2 of this article and include more women there. So, when you are thinking about Women in Bitcoin, who comes to your mind, apart from Jinyoung Lee Englund?
@_date: 2014-11-20 12:54:42
Ok, will include it to the Vol.3 :)
@_date: 2014-10-21 13:02:21
Liquid substance? ;)
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:51:19
sorry, we're fixing the technical problem now
@_date: 2014-10-17 13:06:59
Absolutely agree! Amsterdam can really become the Bitcoin capital. btw, have you seen another article on BitPost? These guys want to have 100 merchants in Amsterdam to accept BTC by 2015: 
@_date: 2014-10-31 12:12:59
Agree, though the software should be improved constantly. How about solving the 51% issue, for example?
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:41:26
We're not a news website, we're a website about the Bitcoin community. Delivering a news before others is not a priority, while gathering Bitcoin-related websites, and services that accept Bitcoin, is.
@_date: 2014-10-19 07:24:21
Seems like every Bitcoiner does
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:42:28
Sorry, it's hard to survive on Reddit. 
Thanks for the feedback about the article!
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:36:58
Thanks! Will likely make a local groups overview in the nearest time. 
Bitcoin community itself knows for sure more than a media resource does. :)
@_date: 2014-12-01 11:00:57
Thanks! Will do :)

BitPost is founded by girls with a sense of humour, that is all
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:37:05
Are there any evidences?
@_date: 2014-10-19 07:23:58
Well, we didn't say it's a good mix. It's just interesting whether it is ever possible and how it would go then...
@_date: 2014-10-31 12:33:05
Ok, thanks! If you recall smbd else, mail to team
@_date: 2014-10-29 09:40:44
nice :) 
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:20:10
Thanks for the feedback! Are you active in any Bitcoin community groups on FB or anywhere else on the web?
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:52:23
Would you like to write an article about China for BitPost?
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:14:49
sorry if you're offended by that. we just want to develop a discussion and involve more people.
could you please at least speak out about your predictions?
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:15:12
cool, thanks for the link!
we are going to write about more tools in the future, so if you have others in mind, please, write here or mail to team
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:43:36
Media for and about the Bitcoin community
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:40:08
This is definitely not a "Bitcoin only" discussion.
We just wanted to let the Bitcoiners know about it and point out that Bitcoin has its place there.
