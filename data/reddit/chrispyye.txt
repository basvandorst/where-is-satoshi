aaa that's the answer i was looking for. I only saved the key i posted. I guess that's the public key. and the private keys are all gone.

this is the address. blockchain says there are 0 bitcoins here. but what do i do with this address? if i had money on it.

thanks :P just checked got dissapointed. 0 bitcoins. haha
I remember when i discovered bitcoin people were giving them out for free because they were so cheap at the time. And i had 25 bitcoins somewhere... i guess not on this address. 
anyway in case i had some bitcoins on this address. How would I trade them for money then?

i remember saving this file, but in local computer which i formated few time since then well i guess i'm "lucky" i don't have any bitcoins on that address. But my friend has something like 1000 of them on his and can't find his wallet neither.  
(we discovered bitcoin togethe, made accounts, he bought some of them/got some of them for free (like a promotion) and this morning i tought i could check my gmail history cuz we made "backup" copy of our wallets by sending addresses on our email.)

I am wondering that aswell. If I operate purely with bitcoins why would I need company for. Except for all the legal reasons.  
But for bussines that generate then less than &lt;$100 per week it is not worth opening a bussines

for example let's say I run a web based bitcoin lightning game. (like lightning chess for example). for something like that I don't see any need of opening a company?

yeah, i have been following bitcoin for past few days.(heard for it smth like 3 years ago when was still small, but thought it is just some prank.) And was thinking about just spending smth like 20€ on it. Just for the sake of curiosity. Don't have more money to make bigger deposit :(.   
BTW thanks for the help guys :D

wow dude thanks for this. :D You made things much understandable. Need to go to bed now. I will research offline wallet&amp;private keys when i wake up, and probably deposit 20€ on coinbase account. hehe
