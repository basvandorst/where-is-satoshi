Though I love to hate them too, Jafari's predictions have been eerily accurate.. so far all of her predictions have been right on the money. The latest prediction being that in this latest wave, Bitcoin may reach as high as $3,900.  Let's see if that happens ;).

If you aren't a developer, the easiest way may be to use an open-source client such as this: [
Be aware there's always a chance of malicious code.  Due diligence is required, make sure it looks like a popular and active project, scan through the code to make sure it all looks legit (this may be difficult if you aren't a developer).  Once you're satisfied, download the source files and viola you're halfway there..

Just because you know how to download an app and install it doesn't make you an expert.  He's right, all you need is a private key to hold bitcoins.  Now if you forked the Bitcoin Core software and implemented a custom private key generation scheme, that's a different story, I highly doubt that...  Also consensus means an agreement between multiple parties, your statement on defining consensus rules for your own node makes no sense.

If Bitcoin is adopted mainstream, a $100,000 price is not far fetched.  [A paper]( has been written recently that suggests a price of $5.8 million, which sounds a bit high to me, but who knows? ;)

A nonce is just a number that must be incremented each time.  Different apps may generate this number differently so you can't use the same api key with multiple apps or there will be conflicts.

I can vouch for Bittrex having a solid and reliable API.  
Poloniex's API is horrible second only to Kraken.. when there used to be good action, their API would go down at the worst possible times.. the lag issues seems to be improved now somewhat however.  I think that's because a bunch of users left the site due to their non-existent support.

For the good of Bitcoin, I'll try to help explain it in a way that your pea brain might understand.  You've admitted that every "node" holds the ledger.  Can you agree that this ledger is a history of every transaction that has ever occurred, the end result it contains a record of all balances owned by each address.  For example, Satoshi mined the first ever block, the genesis block, by the rules of Bitcoin he was thus rewarded with 50 BTC.  He now owns that 50 BTC and anyone with the copy of the Bitcoin Core software and ledger would be in consensus (oh my a big word!!) of this.  Now of course private keys are not stored in the ledger, it isn't necessary using public-private key encryption only the public keys, e.g. Bitcoin addresses, are needed to be stored on this ledger.  Sorry but you are pretty ignorant or a huge troll.  If you're just ignorant, please read up a little more or you're gonna end up losing your money.

All i can say is that their trading engine is head and shoulders above Poloniex's and Kraken's.  With Poloniex I would be extremely worried if any issues came up as their support has never once answered my support tickets.  I've run into many quirks with Poloniex's trading engine.. for example, a margin trading bug once cost me ~2000.. upon closing my position it used all my funds to short and then bought them all back at above market price.. you can actually see evidence of this occurring in the past on their margin trading pairs, and of course nothing can be done because they don't answer your tickets, really stupid.

try something like localbitcoins

Tech wise, they claim their asics are developed at 16nm node size (same size as the current generation Antminers)... yet somehow their chips are 2x faster and 10x more power efficient?  100% scam until further proof is provided.

There are more than a few serious bugs with Poloniex's margin system.  Here's a couple that have negatively impacted me... once upon closing a position it used my entire tradable balance to buy up at market value then sell them down below value, the charts reflect that this has happened numerous times to other people in the past..  Here's a strange one, once, instead of returning the originally currency that I had leveraged off of, it returned it all in bitcoin even though I had not even a significant position.

They need to bring back the trollbox.  The increasing lack of transparency and support issues are concerning.
