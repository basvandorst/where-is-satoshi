Shaking out the weak hands right now. I hope the people who are selling aren't panicking and losing money though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:56
I just bought a bit more. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:08:03
Use USD$ to buy Bitcoin or Ether on Coinbase, then transfer it to an exchange like Binance where you can trade it for a wide variety of alt coins. Personally my favorite right now is IOTA. It's had huge gains lately and is still relatively unknown, so it could explode in the next year or so.

I sold a bitcoin RIGHT at the bottom this morning ($10,400) after SWEARING I would never panic sell. I just couldn't take it anymore. Of course it went back up to 12,000 almost immediately. I can take solace in the fact that I bought the damn thing back in 2013 for like $1,000, so that's over 9 grand in profits on something I thought was dead in the water until earlier this year. It kills me that I could have sold it last night or later today for an additional $4K or so, but you live and you learn I guess. It isn't ALL of my crypto holdings, and it covers the entire amount I've ever spent on crypto and then some, so it's OK ... I'm still kinda pissed at myself tho—not THAT I sold, just the scared, irrational way that I did it. Damn! If this thing dips down toward 10 or lower, don't make the mistake I did. I'm buying back in, if I can. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:48:45
Look at the GDAX chart. It hit 19,703 just before 11:30 a.m. before dropping rapidly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:59
What is it then? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:16:20
Binance works for me
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:10
If you make a short bet, you are betting that the price will go down. With a futures contract, you are just speculating on the price, not actually buying the asset itself. BUT if you already have enough of the asset to dump that you can start a downward trend by selling it (this assumes that the large financial institutions are the ones buying and driving the price up now), then you can in effect create a panic and a crash—which makes your futures contracts valuable. Plus, of course, you'll have made a bunch of money as the asset itself rose in price (when you sell it en masse for fiat to start the downward price action). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:55:09
Yeah, and the Internet is an answers machine. I’m not going to be able to explain something better than the Trezor website/blog. Google some shit first, and if it doesn’t make sense, ask questions on Reddit. Anyway, that’s what I do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:22:52
Yeah, I must have missed that one. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:56:31
Unrelated to all the price swings: Does anyone know if there is a safe/official wallet for Bitcoin Gold yet? I had my BTC on Jaxx at the time of the fork, and I'm wondering how to claim my BTG... so that I can put it back into BTC. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:25
It's not based on "trust," it's based on MATH—cryptography. You sound like someone who "trusts" the government. Why?  
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:21:08
Transferring Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin from Coinbase to GDAX is free and instantaneous. I did it just the other day, easily, even during the height of the madness on Thursday morning. Follow this guide:  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:01
ETH and LTC are still near their all-time highs. ETH was over $800 earlier today. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:16:41
You can easily put $100, $200, whatever, into either one. There is no requirement that you buy whole coins. That said, Litecoin is increasing in price at an even faster percentage rate than Bitcoin, so it makes sense in that regard. But thinking of one as "cheaper" isn't really the right way to think about it. Investments should be thought about in terms of percentage of returns, not number of shares or number of coins, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:25:36
I'm talking about diversifying within crypto, obviously. Since that's everything that's available on Coinbase, it's a good start. Then sure, throw in some other alt coins on another exchange or something. And yes, traditional investments too. This isn't rocket science. I'm just surprised at everyone freaking out like BTC is the ONE TRUE COIN and BCH is some abomination or something. You won't catch me in Vegas anytime soon though. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:53:51
Well yeah, I mean I didn't even look at it for YEARS, and the last month or so have been CRAZY. So yes, I panic sold ... not everything, just enough that I could live with myself if it dropped down to like $5000 or less. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:30:25
They're pretty easy to read: The top and bottom of the bars are the open/close price for whatever the time increment is (open price is on the top for down/red bars; open price is on the bottom for up/green bars) and the line (wick) at the top and bottom are the full range of the price for that time increment. People mainly use them to gauge the momentum of the price and predict the top or bottom of a range. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:01:54
Exactly, I was being greedy, waiting to pass $20K ... or $25K... then I panicked when it felt like the floor was falling out. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:25
Keeping this in mind is probably the only thing that has kept me from bailing. I don't want to be part of the problem, feeding the selling frenzy. Eff that. HODL!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:03
Yeah, I thought so to. And I was for a while. But there's never been this level of hysteria about crypto, on the news, on social media, on Reddit, everywhere I turn. Hell, even my 70 year old dad is talking about it (shitting on it, of course, saying it isn't "real"). I should have tuned it all out and held strong, but I got swept up in the FUD. It was a shameful moment of weakness. I really was thinking, "What if this is the end and I don't even get at least 10Gs!?!?!"

Thank you. Predictably, there are some people LOLing at me, but I can't really be that mad about making so much profit just because I could have made more ... hindsight is 20/20. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:55
Are people really looking at BTC $17,000+, BCH $3,000+, ETH $800+, and LTC $300+ on Coinbase and freaking out like something is wrong? If you have diversified your holdings, like you ALWAYS should do, you are sitting pretty right now.

Can someone explain these buy and sell "walls" that everyone is talking about now? How do you look at / understand them on GDAX? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:52:24
Yeah, I claimed mine in a Trezor wallet, for instance. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:00:03
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:05
Most sellers are probably new buyers. Can't handle the pressure!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:23:50
OK, so if you're already diversified, why are you worried about one-day price movements? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:11:43
Same way you read candle charts for stocks. It's helpful knowledge to have, but trading based on it seems pretty iffy to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:18:15
I use their website (don't have experience with their app). I picked it because it's one of the only places in the US that you can acquire IOTA. Works fine for me so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:36:37
My crypto portfolio is mostly BTC; some BCH, ETH and LTC; lots of cheap IOTA (this one is gonna blow up, I think); a few XMR; and some ARK (another cheapy that might get big gains eventually). I theoretically have some BTG, but the claiming / wallet situation seems sketchy still and I'm not gonna fuck with it. 
Diversification absolutely matters. Of course. That said, the percentages you've allotted make sense. You are diversified. Obviously Bitcoin has been gaining the most recently, but IOTA has the potential for massive returns long-term, and Litecoin is on a nice run in the last week. Ether is cool, but it's too stable to really be very fun. I mainly use it as a means of exchange for other coins so that I don't have to use my Bitcoin when I want to dip into some other alt coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:49:33
Reddit doesn't even let you COMMENT for a week after you sign up. I'm still waiting for my Reddit newbie shine to wear off. Been hodling bitcoin for years though. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:05
They buy mass quantities to drive the price up, then buy short futures contracts, then dump massive quantities to burst the bubble, which makes their short contracts valuable—voila, they've made money on the way up and the way down. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:51:37
The amount of questions that get asked that could be quickly and easily answered with a google search is mind-boggling. Never mind "how does bitcoin work?" some of these people seem to be taught how the fucking internet itself works. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:05:45
I think CNBC (and the financial media at large) are mad that people (like me) now check their crypocurrency apps/charts more than their Yahoo Finance/stock apps/charts, so they're trying to make people panic sell. They did "Bitcoin Week" or whatever last week, to give themselves some air of impartiality, now it's going to be nothing but gloating as the price drops. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:48:41
Somewhere in between. I'm not "obsessed" with profits, but yes, I wanted to make the money back that I invested. Everyone should want that. I love the technology and crypto in general and there are a few coins/platforms I'd like to see succeed long-term. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:45:01
They said all along they were going to launch BCH at the beginning of January, so it's not THAT early. And before that people were bitching for months that it was taking TOO LONG. Can't please everyone ... or anyone on this sub, apparently. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:15:55
Indeed. It's obvious what this tool is, but it's still funny to me to reply to bullshit with rational words. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:13:01
I thought GDAX linked automatically to Coinbase. They're the same company.

He is saying that people sell both asset classes for comparable reasons, but the effect is different in the two different markets because of the differences in volume, liquidity, etc.

I hope so. I don't know why it doesn't have widespread support yet. I believe it will soon. They just partnered with Microsoft, and a lot people are excited about it.

Is that about the level we're at here? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:42:50
Lol no
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:58:36
If it's a small amount on Coinbase, I wouldn't worry about it that much. You really only need to transfer it to a wallet if it's a large amount that you don't plan on touching for a while, or if you have reason to believe the exchange you bought it on isn't secure—which Coinbase is. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:15:49
Actually I didn't. Did you read my post. I bought at $1,000 and sold at $10,400. I'm just mad that I sold when prices were dropping rather than having faith they'd bounce back. I still made money smh
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:02
Longtime HODLer, since 2013, and I just panic sold some when it dipped under $11K. Now I feel like an asshole. On one hand, it feels good to know that I made money on my investment and that money is "safe" now in fiat, on the other hand I'm kicking myself for not having sold when it was higher—or for selling at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:17
Depends where you had your bitcoin stored at the time ... but no, if you don't want to sell it, you don't need to claim it now. It will always be there.

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:28:09
Hmm, that sucks. Of course $7 in the world of crypocurrency isn't that much... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:24:50
That's the million dollar question (literally). No one knows! My feeling at first was that futures might give Wall Street fat-cats a way to manipulate the price and drive it down, but the more I think  and read about it the more skeptical I'm getting whether that will actually be the case. In any event, I plan to take some fiat profits this weekend, just in case. If the price goes way up next week, I'll probably wish I would have just held (hodled?) it all, but if it does go down I'll be glad I did—and will probably buy back in. The thing to ask your self, as always with bitcoin (and investing generally), is what kind of risk tolerance do you have. So far this year, Bitcoin has been impervious to all negative press, forks (Bitcoin Cash, Gold, whatever), etc., and I think the futures will be much the same—little to no effect. That said, hedging your bets is usually a smart idea... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:07
This is fucking wild. Try so hard not to panic sell. Just trying to figure out what price I'm OK with.... fukc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:17:28
So after all the panic and angst this afternoon, here we are with prices for BTC and BCH holding fairly steady. *Yawn*
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:56
Coordinated selling, negative press, and fear. Just relax and HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:17:37

"BetTheLambo"? Bet you're trollin
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:59:20
Seems to me that the futures just give the institutional buyers an additional tool to play with. If they buy huge amounts of short futures on Monday, it may spook people, and then when the institutions start selling the large positions of actual bitcoin they've accumulated while running the price up this week, the price starts dropping and regular people get rattled even more, start selling off in a panic, further driving the price down—then the institutional buyers use their short futures contracts (already purchased for a bargain) to get back more bitcoins on the cheap. Something like that ... lol, I think it makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:09:54
Also curious about this. I had my bitcoin on Jaxx at the time of the split, now I'm wondering what's a reliable way to claim my BTG without fucking up in some weird way. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:22
Haha you wish, I guess. I don't think so. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:59:07
Well, BTC is up 97 percent over the last month, and LTC is up 317 percent over last month, so I guess it depends what your time horizon is.

When bitcoin gets a new boner it's the hardest one it's ever had. So the new one smashes 20K easily, and now we're dealing with decades. Still fast, but brutal. We hit 30K this year; a lot of people are wrecked. We don't care, we bang that skull on 40, 50,75—every sexy number on the way up...to forever.

@_date: 2018-02-01 21:26:31
I panic sold some bitcoin back when it dipped to $10,500, and then it immediately shot back up to like $12,000 and then higher. I've been resisting the urge to do the same thing now, but I was getting weak and decided to transfer some bitcoin off my Trezor onto GDAX so that I could sell if it went any lower—and LITERALLY the moment I plugged my Trezor into my computer the price started going back up. WTF—it feels like bitcoin reacts to my actions specifically. But I guess a lot of people feel that way lol.
