Would have probably bought 50$ or 100$ for fun, but stupid as I am I would have probably lost it, then flash-forward to 2017 I wouldn't have been able to sleep for months due to the culpability eating me from the inside.

Absolutely. It doesn't make sense in Bitcoin's current state, transaction time and fees. Looks like KFC hasn't done its research.

What about animal cruelty? Billions of animals are being tortured and killed everywhere. 
Also Oceans protection? No ocean = no life on earth anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:18:34
Did you sell? You haven't lost until you sold.
TDLR. Don't sell.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:46:41
Agreed. Who in his right mind would buy pets in pet stores? Contact your nearest animal shelters instead of enriching animals slavers.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:20
Get out. Sell now. That's the best advice you'll receive. As much as I hate to say it, this growth is unsustainable
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:01
You're aiming for the dip?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:44:33
I figured
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:20
Yes that was my point. Now think that a number of people just memorise their private keys... It's easy - and tempting- to bypass the law. Not sure I would do it though.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:33:44
Shhhhh. Don't tell them, I need to accumulate
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:45:03
I hear Qubes is not bad
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:14:57
Of course. But technically, I don't understand how is it possible to tax something that is stored on a blockchain. I might have misunderstood the whole thing, but in my understanding only the private key can be physically "held" somewhere in a given place geographically speaking. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:04:36
Exactly haha! It's like kooks flooding the Trestles line-up lol
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:40:45
Here is an example.
**Hacked on bittrex for 100k. Need to know what happened**
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:36
Exactly. It is artificial, as much as I hate to say it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:49
Mate, it gained $5K in less than 2 days without reason. That's certainly not the success of the Lightning network on testnet that caused this rally. It's USA institutional money. They're playing with the emotions of people and they're good at it. The minute a big fat whale presses the sell button, it will trigger a wave of panic-sell due to the insane amount of newcomers and weak-hands that just got into crypto. Then this will dive even further due to the all stop-losses orders being triggered. It's always the same story.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:20
My guts tells me that an insane amount of newcomers, of weak hands, that have never experienced a correction or even a dip, will panic sell after the first whale pushes the sell button. And this will trigger all the stop-loss orders and dive even more deeper. Been there. It's only a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:30
Same here. I chose XRP it's less stressful and I can now sleep. 
Just kidding. I prefer other alts
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:01:23
Man. This sub reddit is awesome, it feels like home
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:48
Sorry for your loss. 
Before starting, a friendly advice: Never ever share your private key and your passphrase online. There are sharks everywhere these days.
1. Identify which exchange he was trading on.
2. If you father left his coins on the exchange
3. If he didn't, then he must have moved his coins to a wallet. It can be either an online wallet or a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano S...)
You should be able to do some more research through his browser history to see which site he was visiting most?
It's almost impossible to help you if we don't know. Ideally, you need to be able to identify his wallet where you can use his private key+passphrase
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:15:45
What tells you he is not a BTC millionaire already?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:22:49
Pretty sure that if you type "wallet" in his browser history you will find the wallet's site he was visiting the most, and you might find his wallet this way.
On another security note, you should keep in mind that it is not recommended to store your private keys anywhere on the computer. People have been hacked this way [this week]( It's much better to write it down and store it somewhere very safe. And maybe a copy at a family member's house that you trust. The person who have this private key have control of your money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:25:07
It's safe to say that most don't day-trade anymore
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:39:20
Well if that's true, he undoubtedly deserves some coins
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:41:12
I don't know where you live but in Europe's shelters it's just normal dogs, very few pitbulls.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:56:29
Definitely a great idea. Not just the Pacific, all oceans. I believe Boyan Slat is the one who took the initiative
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:44:40
How can Bitcoin (or any crypto) ownership be considered a foreign investment?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:26:30
API Calls. It's exactly what happened 3 months ago to [this guy](
Follow this to check if you have been hacked. In the beginning of the reply from all_is_all_to_all, there is quick manip to enter in your terminal    
    "notepad.exe C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
"on a normal system, it should look like this: 
If it has an entry for your exchange, you are hacked. It will look like this  
this is what it would look like if they redirected your exchange to another IP address on your computer, since windows checks this file first before querying DNS (Domain Name System) for the IP Address of yourexchange.com."
Other ways to check are also included in alll_is_all_to_all post in the link above

Actually it's a great timing. The Rothschilds invested in brick and mortar during wartime while there was blood in the streets and made a fortune.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:05:21
Bitstamp crashed and Coinbase as well. Looks like a DDoS due to the coincidental timing
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:20:04
Just use [Revolut]( They charge the interbank rate, the lowest possible fee at the moment. You basically don't see the difference. Free bank transfers in 25 currencies. Their standard Debit Card is FREE. You can then send money to your mother like a text, she'll receive it within seconds on her phone app, then use her card to spend it. And the best part is no fee when spending money abroad on your/her travels! I've been using it for 3 years worldwide. All my family members use it now.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:47:17
Sure but I think a good part of this rise is artificial. Hype. Overbought. No matter what you think of it, pro or detractor, Bitcoin is still becoming harder to mine, slower to transact, and more expensive to send. So unless an improvement is made to the block size issue, there will always be corrections, like in any volatile market. It's just a matter of when.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:17:08
Agreed. Looks like they weren't prepared. For companies earning millions every month, I'd say it is a total fail
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:12:01
One of the goods too. Compare the cryptos that these 2 support it will help you make your decision. 
[Ledger]( = BTC XRP ETH All ERC20 Tokens + many others
Here is the [Trezor]( site
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:25:00
There's a reason if approximately half of the crypto community use a Nano S Ledger Wallet. Great product, they have the best support team, and they reply here on their reddit page to any (rare) issue within minutes. State-of-the-art start-up.

Harry, let's face it. And I'm not being funny. I mean no disrespect, but you're a cunt. You're a cunt now, and you've always been a cunt. And the only thing that's going to change is that you're going to be an even bigger cunt. Maybe have some more cunt kids.

It has nothing to do with Greece's recession. It's the same with every EU country, all 28 of them since 2018, Switzerland has to automatically exchange banking data with these countries,  who do the same.

Yes that was when the Bitcoin blockchain was congested like in late december/ early january during the last bull run. Basically, too many transactions for not enough hardware power.

Hey I replied on the chat
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:24:53
I'm a frenchman living in Switzerland \( but full disclosure, I'm poor :\) \). It's been all over the news for the last 2\-3 years. You can google it. The EU pressured Switzerland to release potential tax evaders' names and account information. For instance, french fiscal residents had something like a year to declare their swiss accounts. This law ended Swiss Banking Secrecy. If you want a way around it, you have to move to Switzerland.
And there is NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX in Switzerland. Your crypto gains are 100&amp; your money.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:13:51
Well that's even worse than I thought!
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:33:42
Of course they all know it. And that's the scary thing. They all know it and yet no one is raising a finger. It won't change until the people force them to change the system, and I strongly believe that's what we're doing thanks to Satoshi.  F\*ck banks and f\*ck the politicians. All of them.
