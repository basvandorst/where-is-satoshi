He at times tries to conceal this attitude towards me, but more often than not the truth comes out.  I'm a successful 42 yr old, so you would think he could cut me some slack but noooo...

ok i think i got it, is there a superior tool out there for creating the paper wallet?  I saw someone using bitaddress.org via a disconnected PC, I suppose I will test it with a small amount first.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:40:28
yup, follow a good "paper wallet" tutorial on youtube.  Got me sorted.

1password, keepass etc are not much good if a keylogger is running on your machine.  Not sure how they would have circumvented the sms though.  Sounds more like a hack within coinbase itself, more of an internal thing.  You may not be the only one, could be 100's or 1,000's of victims.

Central Banks call the shots, or should I say the top 1% call the shots.  They'll do everything they can to destroy Bitcoin.  What it will ultimately come down to is can the top 1% assert more power over the billions of people who decide they want to use Bitcoin.  As they say, bitcoin is a protocol like http etc.  What would happen if the top 1% tried to shut down http?  We could be on the precipice of a new era, an era where the internet generation rises up and takes back control.  Imagine next generation political parties that want to regulate bankers and corporations and de-regulate the Internet including Bitcoin.

Disappointing.  Here's hoping the 25mil injection can help them sort this out.  Then again the negative reviews could be part of a widespread disinfo campaign by the establishment... make people scared to touch bitcoin.  We're going to see a lot of this imo.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:36:11
Thanks for this post, absolutely brilliant video.  I can see a war coming.  The financial sector is beyond powerful, will they not do everything in their power to outlaw bitcoin and destroy it?  Their own institutions are at stake, trillions of dollars are at stake (for these mega rich sociopaths).  Can bitcoin be more powerful that these institutions?  Will the NSA end up having to mount a brute force processing attack on bitcoin to stop it, etc?
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:11:54
I have the coins now :)  Can I ask you as a noob what should I do now?  You mention blockchain.info wallet.  Is this a local wallet?  Can you describe in laymans terms what I should do because I'm having difficulty getting my head around it (in spite of seeing tutorials).  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:32:09
This is likely my only option.  He's quite pissy about it, "I didn't know you had money like that to flush down the toilet", etc.  I probably should have never brought it up but I thought he might like to buy some coins since he is quite diversified in stocks, bonds and realestate.  I doubt he will cave in until a bitcoin is worth 50k or so and he can see that it's continuing to flourish.

Consumers... don't eff this up ffs.

I guess if bitcoin is banned then we'll see entrapment scenarios similar to p2p file sharing.  We would see a lot of news headlines: "Dude trades 0.005 bitcoin to IRS bitcoin taskforce, fined $500,000"..
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:53:08
lol, nailed it.
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:15:08
They are more likely to claim this, but then use the coins in a variety of methods... such as paying off informants, paying off hackers they hire to do dirty jobs, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:46:35
This is frustrating because if you do what you are supposed to you WILL NOT lose your coins.  How can they regulate something based on people buying a product and failing to use it properly?
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:54:55
How could it be traced?  If I were a corrupt senator the lobbyist would get a small card with my anonymous bitcoin address on it.  The money would go to this anonymous address.  I would then use a dummy account on a burner phone to move the money to different addresses offline.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:06:05
Cool, thanks guys!  We have to wait to next sat. so will do it then.

They are scared shitless as they are watching their livelihoods on the verge of evaporating.  "No middle man required?  No central banks, hrmmm, errrr,uhhhhh.. oh godddd!!! no paycheck!! ok uhhhh... child porn!!! weapons!!! drug dealers!!! terrorists!!!"
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:16:22
they're all connected.. it's why most corps pay no taxes.  If bitcoin wipes out taxes then the top 1% will have to pick up that slack.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:39:51
No what I mean is if you have a keylogger and setup a new password into your password database then the keylogger would capture that.  The copy encrypted to clipboard should be fine.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:17:37
No, it means I am not good at arguing with my old man and he's quite closed minded over it.  I'm just not sure how to breakthrough his wall of disbelief that a global digital currency is viable.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:03:19
Dude, i just had a similar exchange with my father.  I tried so hard to explain all this to him but keep getting the fingers in the ears and not wanting to hear it.  "It's a ponzi scheme" "It's a pyramid scheme" blah blah.  I'm now in his eyes an irresponsible idiot for buying BTC blah blah.  Meanwhile, as a successful 40yr adult I am doing my best to ignore him and will now forever change the subject.

That's precisely why I just got in last week.  I was quite frantic to get in as a semi-early adopter.  The stressful part was learning as much as possible about bitcoin, obtaining bitcoins and then learning how to properly store them offline for safe keeping.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:11:59
Oh, I'm not meeting the guy in person.  I am depositing cash into his bank account.  localbitcoins says his coins are held by him, i deposit his money and then he releases them to me.

What's to stop another company or thousands from making their own internets?  Would you start using multiple alternate internets or THE internet?
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:41:33
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:38:33
let's assume for the sake of argument this is possible (personally I think -no way in hell but anyway...).  The way around this is not to store too much coin at one address.  I typically have 1 address per coin at this stage.
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:27:03
I got 2FA enabled before buying my coins.  I also bought and did everything on a Ubuntu live CD.  Once I finally obtained my coins I quickly split them up into multiple paper wallets.  I have 10 bip38 encrypted paper wallets now storing my coins.  If at any time I need to use some I have a few paper wallets with low amounts of value and I only place one of those in a live account at any one time.  Also, for passwords I store them in Keepass which encrypts them and my clipboard when copy/pasting them into password fields.  It really sucks to hear of people being hacked, it certainly does not do any good for bitcoins image :(

The naysayers all sound the same.  It reminds of when the iPad was unveiled and 100's of tech pundits declared it would be the biggest flop in product history.  Now Apple sells 6,500 iPads an hour.  I'm also not getting all this "speculation" chatter.. aren't we seeing millions of dollars worth of product purchases?
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:20:15
Banks like JPM better get ready to find new markets, maybe they could get into pet food.  When the whole world realises they can ditch transaction fees they are history.  Let's take my small biz for example.  In a bitcoin world my business expenses would be roughly $7,000 less per year.  I would be able to sell my products for less, it goes on and on.  Everyone in the world suddenly sees their wealth rising when we tell these central banks to go fuck themselves.
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:47:23
I too hope some better methods become available.  I ended up going through localbitcoins, made sure my guy had a lot of 100% feedback.

A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. In a ponzi scheme, early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters, and the late adopters always lose. Bitcoin has an expected win-win outcome. Early and present adopters profit from the rise in value as Bitcoins become better understood and in turn demanded by the public at large. All adopters benefit from the usefulness of a reliable and widely-accepted decentralized peer-to-peer currency.

This is a great read, have been looking for info like this.  So just 13.3% of the pie = an $800,000 bitcoin.  I think 13.3% is a conservative number when you think about exponential growth (and acceptance) of technology.  30 years from now why would anyone use something other than bitcoin?  Bitcoin will be like "credits" that we often see mentioned in various science fiction universes.  A global (intergalactic even) single currency.  In my mind, looking ahead 30yrs out I would see traditional currencies rapidly in decline and bitcoin becoming the standard.  Governments will fight this but they will have no more chance of shutting it down than they could shut down the internet.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:15:01
i should also add, I don't want to use my coins, basically want to store them.
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:39:48
I wish these headlines would stop using the country name.  "Norway" has not rejected bitcoin, it is the top 1% in Norway that reject it, the rich bankers and elite.  Same with all the "countries" rejecting Bitcoin.  This has nothing to do with governments or the people of said country.  It's the top 1% of every country making these calls, nothing more.
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:57:29
I would also imagine clandestine US government projects funding "assets" with bitcoin.  Totally untraceable.  Maybe bitcoin will feature heavily in the next Bourne film :P

I'm recently in too.  Are we still "early adopters"?  Sure I would have loved to buy up a few 1,000 coins for pennies but oh well.  The forecasts still look promising.  It's looking like 3k per coin in 2014, so I doubt we will lose out.  It's a very small risk to invest in what could be the "next big thing".

Can people overseas use squarecash?  I'm thinking buy a visa debit card with only $20 loaded on it, then using that as the "linked" card on squarecash.

im in NZ,  actually the localbitcoins holds everything in escrow.  I deposit to him, and LBC releases the coins.  I'm in communication with the guy and feel a little better about it, he has done a lot of solid transactions and has good feedback..
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:43:53
I suspect companies like google will start accepting bitcoin and paying out adsense in bitcoin.   At this point companies like google, coinbase, etc will start adding some of their massive processing power to keep transactions healthy (because it will be in their best interest).  maybe?
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:31:24
good to see some of these sites using mBTC now, just makes sense to me.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:33:52
As a small business owner the main reason for me was to raise awareness of bitcoin.  My small biz now accepts bitcoin.  Just by doing that and announcing it we now have 1,000's more people aware of bitcoin.  I want bitcoin to succeed in a major way, I do not want to continue giving $1,000's up $1,000's of my dollars to Paypal, Visa, etc.  My adding bitcoin brings nothing to me short term, but it's my part in trying to help change the world and put money back into the hands of the people.  If we can do that, then one day our wealth will increase a great deal.

In the current paradigm no government speaks for the people.  Voting for one sociopath politician over another changes nothing.  The power structures call the shots.
