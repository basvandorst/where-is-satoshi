Eh, how could they lose access to them? They are just scamming us...

That's right, but this is an option, right? I am not forced to pay the $99 per month?
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:42:46
I am very confused here... If I pay $99 per month I can trade as much as I want for no fee whatsoever.
If I don't pay $99 per month I pay 0.5% fee for trades?
Otherwise, who the fuck would pay $99 per month in order to be able to trade coins? Do you know that one of the major things with cryptocurrencies is low fees, and $99 per month is certainly not a low fee...

How can you say that our BTC at MTGox are gone forever? Why would MTGox not give them back to us? If they don't they will be sued so frickin' hard and it's not like MTGox is a company that is in the anonymous zone. I mean how hard could it be to get in touch with the owners? Can't be really that hard, can it...

In EUR, BTCE has higher BTC price than MTGox. In USD BTCE has lower BTC price than MTGox...

It sucks because it takes so much effort to store your BTC safely. And if someone WOULD get their hands on your private key you are so extremely fucked. There is no way to get your BTC back since they are untrackable to a person.
If someone gets your bank account information and steals all your money everything will still be fine since the bank can easily track the money and get them back for you.

I am a reader who needs help, not the fucking helper who has the right knowledge.
Its all about "Oh yeah, its easy, you just have to do this and this and this ad this and that and that and this and that and everything and this and this and this and maybe this and that and this that!!!!!!!!!"

Seriously, would you feel safer storing all your money on a BTC wallet or on your bank?

I have transferred BTC from MTGox to BTCE and it took about 30 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:38:08
Hmm, can someone help me sort it out for me.
I can't get EUR to BTCE so I have to:
* Send 1 000 EUR to MTGox, 0.6% fee?
* Buy BTC for EUR, 0.6% fee?
* Send BTC to BTCE, fee?
* Sell BTC for EUR, fee?
* Sell EUR for USD, fee?
* Buy BTC for USD, fee?
* Sell BTC for EUR, fee?
* Sell EUR for USD, fee?
