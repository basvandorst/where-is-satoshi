I get what you mean. You can increase blocksize now. But this is not going to happen. It has become obvious in the past year that blocksize incease is seen like desert. Miners, exchanges, and other businesses have no problem of eating it and it's preferably the only thing they are interesting in eating. [[Continued...]](

That's because crypocurency has very limited uses right now. You need to start spending bitcoin on real stuff in order for it to be decentralized. We are at a catch-22 right now where people don't want to actually use it as a currency because they see the value skyrocketing and don't want to be left behind. [[Continued...]](

&amp;gt; This means traders/investors originally "borrow bitcoin" at a higher price and then hope to cash out when Bitcoin goes down and "sell" their borrowed Bitcoin. Simply stated, traders/investors acquire Bitcoin at current prices and then sell at lower prices.
&amp;gt; An example would be: Investor shorts Bitcoin at 7K, borrowing a certain amount of Bitcoin at 7K - Bitcoin then goes to 6,500 and the short seller cashes out. [[Continued...]](

I understand. What I'm betting on is that once more companies start to accept trading in Bitcoin as a digital money \(assuming that speed and scalability gets fixed\), demand will keep increasing. [[Continued...]](

BTC isn't crashing, it's selling off like any other asset that has risen a large amount. Everyone that buys has a value that they are willing to sell at. When you reach that level, those people will look to sell, which will suppress the price slightly. [[Continued...]](

The historical "average" decline would be larger, around 70-75% - note that I'm not saying "normal", since some fall less and some fall much more. Some fall all the way to $0, which skews the distribution to the left.
If you wanted to apply historical examples to get a range, you'd start where the rally began ($250 or so, early 2015) and watch for where parabolic growth began - about $1000 at the beginning of 2017. [[Continued...]](

I picked up 50$ in Flexepin this evening. The first location I went to was an Esso station.
Apparently they have a limit of 1000$ per day and the manager is going to try to get it increased. [[Continued...]](

&amp;gt; For Bitcoin to work/succeed, most average users need to run their own full node. Anything less than a supermajority of the economy using full nodes is a failure scenario.
If that's the case Bitcoin would have failed by now, because (at least based on my experience) most users aren't running a full node. And yes - this includes advanced users who would be easily able to run a node if they had interest in doing so.
&amp;gt; And without your own full node, you're not really using or benefiting from Bitcoin at all - you might as well be using PayPal.
I disagree. For most users the difference between a full node and an SPV node is relatively minor (except for bandwidth/storage requirements). [[Continued...]](

&amp;gt; Ok, but then you go on to imply one solution solves technical deficiencies while the other fails to solve them by using marketing.
They already are using marketing. The copied the bitcoin code, removed all links in the code, pasted in the links to their own companies, and are now selling it as an upgrade.
The ideas they have do not align with what's good for the customer. [[Continued...]](

from the original [Huffington Post article](
&amp;gt;**I (Shall Happily) Accept the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics on Behalf of Satoshi Nakamoto**
&amp;gt;Nearly 25 years after receiving my PhD in Finance from the University of Chicago, I finally heard from the Prize Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel -- popularly known as the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. No, I was not awarded the prize -- I was not expecting to. The committee has invited me to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize. I feel honored. Frankly, this is as close as I am going to get to the Nobel Prize. The names of a few deserving candidates quickly flashed through my mind. The names that most people in the Economics profession would agree with, Paul Romer who is at NYU, Doug Diamond at the University of Chicago, Steve Ross at MIT -- the usual suspects -- for their influential work in 1970s and '80s. In all likelihood, they will receive the highly coveted prize sooner or later.
&amp;gt;I then started thinking whose ideas are likely to have a disruptive influence in the twenty first century. The name of the inventor of Bitcoin suddenly jumped up in my consciousness and I have not been able to get it out of my mind since then, Satoshi Nakamoto.
&amp;gt;Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? We don't really know.
&amp;gt;Where does he work and which country does he live in? We don't know.
&amp;gt;Which scholarly journals in the field of Economics or Finance has he published his research in? Not in any of the reputed journals that one would look for -- American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Journal of Finance, Econometrica.
&amp;gt;Has he published anything? Yes, a nine-page white paper titled, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" that he posted on the Internet on May 24, 2009.
&amp;gt;So, "why does he deserve the Nobel Prize in Economics?" I am sure the Nobel Committee who entrusted me -- among a few hundred others, to suggest nominees for the Prize -- would want to know. [[Continued...]](

“I have to trust my instinct” - yes you do. After all that’s what got you into bitcoin in the first place!
Just let me give you piece of advice - perhaps you made a mistake, perhaps not, you’ll see soon enough. But if it turns out you did, don’t make a second one. Long time ago, I sold as well. I was a victim of the fake civil war here (bigblockers before BCH and Segwit2x) and thought maybe Bitcoin can’t be destroyed from outside, but it certainly can be destroyed from within. So after price went down, down and down, for days and days, I finally sold. [[Continued...]](
