This is not my financial advice nor I am asking you to do what I did. 
Was in your situation for couple of months. Bought coins when it was booming(right before  China event). All crumbled like a hot potato. 
Money put in discounted 50%!!! Held through the dark moment.
But right now,  I am in the not too bad position although it's dipping. 
Fingers crossed that it won't be dipping too ridiculous!!!!!  GOOD LUCK!!!

Just bit worried people like James Dimon would do his dirty tricks to prove his tulips thoery.... That's all

So bitcoin and bitcoin cash are having a fight again?  Third round? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:12:10
Salute!! ������ so few people could be that generous like u! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:43:08
Don't get what u mean
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:53:11
I see. So if all the miners shut down and no more miners. The decentralized system will lose its' host and die?  Is that what u mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:42:14
Can someone enlighten me as I am kind of dumb.  I thought bitcoin was meant to be limited. 
Does it really matter if there's no more miners. Wouldn't it make bitcoin become more valuable? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:31:47
But if people like James Dimon keeps short selling it. That would cause the dip and when people panic,  more coin would be sold.  Then that would be bad enough to worry.  Don't you think?

For real? I wonder how hot the nodes could get? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:50:54
Does anyone know if the forking will still go ahead? If it's not a definite answer just yet,  at what point we can be 100% certain? Tks
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:16:49
Would the fork be 100% going ahead? Or it's not yet confirmed? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:03:34
Yes...  No one should be. 
Am not saying don't buy. I said "watchful". I am only sharing my experience. A painful one!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:57:33
No. At least not now. This is a very wrong timing to buy. Trust me,  I have been through many times. 
In case you don't know. For the past 12 hours or so. Bitcoin price has been extremely unstable. Keep hitting the new height. 
You need to wait till everything settle down a bit at least and be watchful before you decide whether to put money.

Then the next one would $15k? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:51:55
I think it won't dip. I think it will briefly hit $10k and drop couple of hundreds due to exhaustion of raising.  Hovering around between $10k mark.  When it's ready,  will keep raising again. 
WHY?  It's basically at $10k. Ppl won't be that stupid to dump at the exact moment of $10k. It would have happened by now,  it there was a dip....

If there's a seller,  there has to be a buyer.  So who is the buyer at the moment?  Why would these people sucking all these coins at this uncertain moment? 
Don't they worry that it would go down further?  How does it work?  Just can't turn my head around.

Closing down Hong Kong exchange too?

@_date: 2017-09-15 03:04:10
Just so u feel better. I am at $11k deficit. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:56:10
Sorry. I don't understand. Should I post this some where else? 
I am only new about all these. Sorry if I made mistakes posting this on wrong platform. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:07:34
Sorry. Very new with crypto. Is there any reason that could cause bitcoin to crash for these few weeks? 
Thinking of doing the most gutless thing by putting $40k. Thanks

@_date: 2017-09-17 08:55:15
Am not expert. But this is what I think. Who knows China residents own how many percent of coins. When they start off loading the coins (ordered by the mass murderer - China government),  the market filled with coins,  the price drops.  
When the price hits to the acceptable low point,  other investors and day traders will jump in suck all the coins at lowest price. Causing the price bounces back. 
The cycle thus will keep repeating daily(I guess)  until everything gets off loaded on China's end?

Am new here.  If i could ask. 
It seems like bitcoin holders will have benefit when it is forked. 
But how come some people seem to worry about it. 
Is there any down fall for this? 
Or it's win- win situation? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:33:20
Ppl is going to get burned. I learnt the hard way.  Never chase the GREEN!!!!!
