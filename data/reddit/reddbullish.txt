Its also absolutely absurd that you pull out peoces of paper and can get stuff with them. Even more absurd is there are electronic dots in your bank accojnt that tell you how many peices of paper you can have.
Worth is what a group of beleivers agree it is. Bitcoin simply embeds those agreements into distributed software code in a system that is extremely difficult to game.

Stole this description from a other thread.
This guy seems to get it too.


[–]modeless 33 points an hour ago* 
Seems pretty clear to me. An early adopter decided $300 is their breaking point. They want to cash out their $9m before they miss their chance. They're not experienced with handling this amount of money because they've never been rich before; they just got lucky. They don't have the connections to sell off-market so they decided to sell the way they know and the way that's guaranteed to work: a Bitstamp sell order below market. They could maybe get more money with a more sophisticated trading strategy but who cares? They'll take their $9m and retire on a beach somewhere for the rest of their lives.
That's what I'd do if I had 30,000 BTC right now and I bet you would too.

I expect them to buy on the open market to gain control of huge amounts of coins to resell to the public as securitized investments at a 20% fee.  The good news about this is wall street and everyone makes MORE money if the price of that bitcoin is higher.
So wall street packaging offerings incentives are to get that price up and keep it up.

My only hope is that these restrictions make it a monopoly club for big boys who will then use their monopoly insider status to escallate the price of bitcoins to the moon like they do everything else.
They'll wrap bitcoins in limited security offerrings secured by bitcoins and sell them to the general public while causing bitcoin prices to soar leading millions to buy those securities like they did mortgage backed securities.
I hang on for the long haul when the Goldman Sachs of the world have destroyed the little guys and monopolized it all so that bitcoins are worth millions each because it makes goldsachs rich. Hopefully i'll have the smarts to sell before the wall street bitcoin bubble bursts (which will be tens of times higher than prices now is my guess).
Lets face it. The homebrew bitcoin is gone like the backyard still but for those or us who own some of the mother grain like some bitcoins the future looks bright as the big wall street hypemasters get in.
If you own a piece of a limited asset that people like Goldman Sachs want to control they will force it into limited scarcity to artificially raise its price to the moon.
Since bitcoin owners now own  the equivelant of an oil barrell or diamond itss the one time I don't mind seeing them get their grubby hands on something and artificially restrict it and raise its value.
Hell soon you won't even be able to buy a bitcoin unless you are an accredited investor is my guess.
Yeah i'll probably have to pay them a 20% commission when I sell but the price will be at $1million a bitcoin or something.

The premise is wrong.
Bitcoin itself is a use case monopoly.
There will never be more than those from mining.
There are more ounces of Gold than there ever will be Bitcoins. Many multiples.
And eventually Bitcoin will be priced accordingly (or better because of Bitcoins convenience of transportation over Gold).
The  Gold scarity ratio indicates an eventual scarity price on Bitcoin of well over $100,000 per Bitcoin.  The math doesn't lie.Bitcoin is more scarce than ounces of Gold and Bitcoin has all and more of the attributes of Gold.

Bitcoin is not money . It is a open priced and timeless contract for exchange.
 Therefore they aren't banks. They are thrid party storage lockers no different than storage lockers you pay on the street which also hold many items of possibly very high value. They are already prohibited under existing law from stealing your stuff and keeping it where they say it is kept.
Bitcoin should only be regulated like legal signatures . Since those laws already exist Bitcoin should prompt no new legislation.
A person who gets into Bitcoin may never buy anything with it EVER therefore it is not a financial transaction.

Fmrs are the hand held walkie talkies you can buy at any sporting goods store.
They dont require any rsdio license to operate, are audio bassed but scrambled so no one can really tell whst audio info you are sending
So it would be trivial to patch an acoustic modem to one to send and receive data.
On a good day ithout obstructions some of them have a range of 25 miles.
But the data would likely be slow.  But just how slow and how fast is needed to support the blockchain i dont know.

Unless all the merchants are agreeing not to resell the bitcoin they take In  then it is logical there would be a lot more coins being sold.
You know when there was no where to spend bitcoins the big wallets had less reason to spend.
I suspect now that so many things can be bought with bitcoin many of the big wallets are saying " why not live off bitcoins in luxury  (whereas before you could live off bitcoin if you wanted to just eat pizza etc.)
Now you can buy almost anything with bitcoin so there is less reason to hang on to tons of bitcoin.

All power line locations are already mapped.
Even consumer flight Sims like Xplane have the reall locations of all radio towers,buildings, powerlines and bridges in their databse which fits in less than 100 megabytes.
Every drone will carry this info and a GPS and easily avoid them. No detection is needed for fixed objects.
Drone navigation is already solved.
Weather has been solved for decades . Its handled in every private place today with universal cockpit systems .
The only thing that will slow drone infrastructure is the horrendeously overreaching FAA and insurance liability worries.
But Obama has stated he is taking rule making regulatory authority for drones away from the FAA SO that will hopefully be handled faster now and with more of a goal of the huge new industry drone infradtruture will be.
Drones will replace a huge number of gasoline trucks and vehicles and roads as well as many first responders in emergencies.
A police drone can get to your house in half the time of a police car and it can carry a gun and taser to handle your intruder quickly.

These rules stop the threat of Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar while enhancing the ability of the big wall street firms to have exclusive rights to wrap bundles of bitcoins in bitcoin backed securities which they will sell to funds for billions while taking percentages for their investment banking fees.
Bitcoins will be worth hundreds of thousands each each as wallstreet banks need to buy more bitcoins to wrap into securities to sell for the trillions to the public just like they did mortgage backed securities.
The wall street money will be made in the wrappings not the holdings just like with mortgaged backed securities.
I expect to see dogecoin backed securities as well.
This may actual revitalize wall street and be the next big bubble becuase their is nothing wall street likes more than something it can state a value for and then warap in a security to sell to others for commissions.  The fact that bitcin is a non dividend asset makes it BETTER becuase there is no way some pesky analyst can contest their valuations based on income return.
This will all be great for bitcoin prices.
We are entering the times of the wall street legendary bubbles.
I beleive that a hugely signiificant portion of wall street firms new business will be bitcoin wrapping securty issuances.  With fincen regs keeping out the little squeakers who could ruin the party by allowing bitcoin to trade at more market I fluenced amounts we should see bitcoin hyping climbing higher and faster than a rocket.

Last years's rise to $1200 was driven just by consumer level money following a newly educated public  when wall street fund managers didn't even know about Bitcoin (money magazine survey showed that)
Imagine the same price pressure but driven by the now educated Wall Street fund managers who have finally started raising far more money in the Billions of dollars. And they are starting at a price point of $400  not $10 !
Every one of the funds who is slow now loses billions in future value.
The race to the top should be much quicker now.

The mainstream part is happening.
The price is not rising faster because early large wallets have started liqjidating some assets  and we have had regulatory changes making it harder for the little guy to co.forta ly get invovled. But that doesnt matter becuase if bitcoin becomes an assets that only the big boys can invest it it will be more exfluseive and its price will be rriven higher by adoptjon legal scarcity in the long run.

But bitcoin value as a better alternative than gold is over $100,000 per bitcoin.
Total capitalized values of all gold divided by total possible number of bitcoins gives you that number.
Bitcoins greatest value is not as a replacement for visa.
Its as a replacement for gold.
Bitcoin is wealth. The fact that you easily spend it doesn't change that.
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:23:54
My question is more about how these things could contniually check future increases.
I am a beleiver in the "total bitcoin capitalized value will one day equal total gold capitalized value" theory.
So I am looking for over $100,000 per coin in years to come.
I just don't know how large dumps of coins might affect that.
This dump is stopping appreciation right  now.

Lol.  If dogecoin becomes the "peoples bitcoin" in 5 yrs  ill be sitting pretty from that tiny gamble.

I beleive that the Ed Snowden leaks have shown that all manor players in the internet today coopersted with the NSA in giving them their data. Microsft was first after they were convicted of being a monopoly and were under threat of breakup. All punishments were suddenly dropped and we now k ow at that time microsft gave theNSA preencryption email capabilities on all microsft products.
Facebook gave up their info.
Apparently Google did too but its unclear how voluntary itas.
The point is i beleive that the nsa promoted and ensured that all the services they could crack remained the most widely used and popular services on the internet.
Remember the secrecy industry has trillions of us dollars to spend as well as access to all lawmakers who can change laws to ensure who wins and loses aswell as people in all media oitlets who can write about any company they want to promote and make you think they are the ones to use.
I beleive the reason  the winklevosses didnt win was they didnt do adeal with the NSA.
Do you REALLY beleive a college dropoit like zuckerburg wzs somehow o different from all theother peolme who had done similiar services like freindster etc and who by his own admissio  was working with several other peolleho all were doing a version of facebook...do you really beleive he just got the funding becuase somehow he wore a hoodie better than the hundreds of tothers also coding woth hoodies at the time:
Or do you think he give up the goods to or was recruited by the nsa at college to do it and they ensured he won?
Which makes more sense?
Especially since we know cia and nsa etc recruit straight out of harvard and mit and provide ealry funding there.
We know for example cia types early fu ded Google students professor mentor at stanford becuase their speeches havebragged about it.

Actually even a government unapproved dependable record of the existence of individuals is very useful.
Other groups and organizatjons and even governments can choose to recognize it without any local official government backing.  
I suspect many will.
Particularly in despotic countries whose leaders may be on trial or overthrown in the future such a record is more valauble than any official government record.

The smart people buying solar panels dont grid tie.
Grid tying is a bondoggle desperatly being pushed (using rebate subsidies) by utitlites to maintain control.
Its far better to look at solar panels as a one time sunk cost with no further costs of power in the future.  Like fax machine or a cellphone.  You dont think of reselling your unused cellphone capacity do you? Yet you wouldnt not have a cellphone today.

Honestly it is the long term progression of that play  that caused me to get into Bitcoin.
I could care less if it replaces western union or you can buy socks with it.
In fact I think it makes it harder to become an elite form of wealth storage when people buy socks with it.
I would just as soon have the sec declare it can only be purchased by certified investors in tue future because i think then it will be more desirable amongst those with large wealth and those of us already in can sell to them much later.

Investing in any third party fund and hoping to get yeilds enough to cover your future bills one day is not as smart as investing insomething thaf rplaces some of those bills today after taxes.  Especially since the price of retail electricity is bound to rise a lot in the future and solar panels when not grid installed are very portable and last nearly forever. ( and if you learn how easy it is to assemble them by doing ebay kits then you never worry if one breaks anyway.)
I f i dont want to i will never pay another electric bill in my life.  Think of the returns on that negative loss averted for an average remaini   lifetime since it is all AFTER  tax savings and of course other than wind damage there is no chance the investment will crash or be a scam like so many "reputable" investments turn out to be after ten yrs.

I bought some coins purely because I beleive that one day they will have the market cap of gold.
That puts each coin at $100k plus.
I STILL beleive it is a relatively cheap gamble with a lot more logic behind it and upside than the typical investment opportunity.
I have also purchased some other coins for the same reason.
You buy a few coins and it might be huge win in a few years.
If not it was the price of a weekend in vegas that lasted yrs of entertainment for the price of two days.
Not to mention i now know how to set up and manage digital oceans servers, gpu cuda coding, and remotely manage headless linux machines.  A great education. 
Btw if other coins go up it will also maintain bitcoin even if bitcoin loses relative value to them.
Also i will never sell any of the bitcoins unless they go above  say 50,000 .  I expect that might take as little as one year or as much as ten. Either way thats fine.  I already exchanged a few bitcins to trade for some interesting alt coins but wont  ever exchangemore tha  i have.  I might trade around some of the alt coins though.
I still beleive it is  good idea for people to buy a couple of bitcoins and other alt coins for exactly these same reasons.
In fact at the lower prices its even a better gamble thats fun and reaso able and very educational.
I also have ended up with some amazing gpu cards out of this wbole thing which i am exploiting for some amazing supercomputing stuff i am just getting started with. I broke evenon the gpu cards and am glad i bought them to mine ( via middlecoin b back when i did.) If i had just bought more bitcoin i wouldnt have the cards or the education i got in linix and gpus and servers.
I actually think there is a lot of money to be made using my new gpu processing skills in business analysis etc. Who knows. That may make me far more extra money than bitcoin ever does.
In fact. Come to think of it it might be a good time to buy more gpu cards if the falling price lowers their price more too.

I found a convertor circuit online that i built. Handled the three ( i think) motherboard voltages. Once i built it, i forgot it but it worked. 
I hadthe pc set to auto reboot and remine so if voltages went wacked they just rebooted and restarted. Also mjned a few very low power coins with efficinet algo so the wattages for the miners wrre greatly reduced.
.havent mined in a while though.
Using the pcs for other things occassionally like a media tivo type server and theyother with the best gpu i use for gpu programming onq  the mains power when  it is on.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:54:00
And this is the difference.
A person with solar panels can use whatever power they want for whatever they want without being incremental cost constrained.
So for example they could mine all day without worrying about profitability and then if bitcoin went to $10,000 coin they would have had an opportunity others without panels dont have.
 BUt hey,  Do whatever suits you!

If you want to see real cost per watt go to ebay right now and look up solar panel kits.
And you convert your place to dc as you go. You dont use dc to go to ac with expensive convertors.
You can get dc appliances now. As examples go to any truck stop and see all the appliances for a truckers cab  ... All dc.
Now when you get good with electronics you relaize the whole computer power supply is simply converting ac  to dc.  Well you already have dc so there go expensive computer power supplies.

We  know that big banks apparently had a huge oil derivatives exposure just before they got the congress to agree to cover their derivatives losses ( you might remember elizabeth warren getting some press last month becuase she fought that)
Almost immediately the saudis starting pumping oil and crashing the oil price.
Several columns said  the oil derivative losses where far larger than anyone ever thought they could be becuaee no one ever predicted such an oil price drop. (people forget oil os not a free market n it is compleltly dominated by saudi arabia as the low cost price provider)
So that begs the question if banks have huge oil derivative losses what will that do to bitcoin. If they were in bitcoin they might be forced to sell and also not buy for price support. That might explain some downward price movement and would correlate with the ops statement this is a sig  of derivatives caused collapse.
It would also mean that eventjally the losing banks selling will stop and until the federal government can calm people and absorb the losses of the banks again , that the bitcoin price might  wildly flucuate up and known for a time.

Someone tell me if I'm wrong but  I think this means people who have have account for more than 1 yr are moving some coins. 
I wish they did one for 3  and 6 yr old accounts because the one yr min doesnt exclude those who bought at the last run up anymore.
I'd like to see a longer term period to get days destroyed from some very early miners.
I wish they would do a zombie account chart as well.
All in all it wouldnt surprise me if ealry miners werent finally buying cars etc. I see it more a sign of them aging rsther than not having faith in bitcoin.  If it was not having faith we would see a LOT more days destroyed and the price wouldemporarily go much much lower.
I do wish we could exclude those who bought on the last runup though.

So if i have coins in cold storage.
If i wait until after the blockchain split occurs i should be able to spend those in BOTH blockchain forks at that time right because each would have inherited the beginning blockchain before the fork.
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:47:38
Bet people have no odea what they are signing up for.
The open way to do this would be to fork the blockchain NOW and see if people want to mine the new coin.
The reason they DIDNT do that is they know it wouldnt happen.
So you think other softwares should adopt this technique?
Why not five different future switcher software versions? What would you think of that?  Why not ten?

So wait.
If this fork happens I cant use my old bitcoins with my old software etc? 
And if i loade a whole new mining system for xt on a fresh wiped computer it would somehow know of my old coins and switch them even if i never used those addresses?
Or if i accessed my old addresses in new xt software it would wipe that address out even if i separately spent those old coins using the original bitcoin software?

But those who dont want the xt will keep running non xt software and mining to the old blockchain the minute it actually splits.
Especially if the difficulty goes down becuase others abandon the original. So there WILL be the continuation of the original bitcoin.  Hell I'll do it..
I already have some alt coins with different block sizes etc as a hedge..  i dont need another.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:22:52
I disagree.
I think once the blockchain split really happens all those seeing the original blockchain continue are going to get scared and jump back to real bitcoin and then xt will be another interesting altcoin .
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:30:00
Hold it.
How is that possible?
How can different software be getting verification on the same blockchain after the fork point.
I can understand how a fork can inherit the old blockchain before the fork and leave it also for the original software which will operate independently on the original but how can two different softwares with different parameters be dually writing to the same blockchain?
And on a second point if there is another software verifying amongst its users then wouldnt its difficulty be completely independent of a group using the old software verifiying amongst themselves?  How can both be using the same count of new writes to the blockchain to adjust difficulty?
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:17:01
So the important questions are
Can you buy bitcoin using some form of electronic remote payment like a credit debit card or paypal or okpay? (can't beleive paypal will not seize their account)
Will this be more convenient than localbitcoins.
Are your coins stored in their system at any time and for how long or are they stored on a wallet you control compleletely.
Whats the incentive for oitsides to run p2p nodes. 
Can the p2p reference portal nodes be taken down like thepiratebay is 
This could be a big breakthrough depending on the answers to those questions.

To all the people saying you have to have money to buy bitcoin so it doesnt help greece.
Not true.
People can begin to compensate each other using bitcoin right now so bitcoin can be earned and exchanged  right now and then used by merchants right now . People would very quickly build up bitcoin balances. Merchants would have an instant drachma replacement without printing anything.

Itcs hold until $200,000 or bust.
The potential payoff is far more than the potential loss.  Not many investments like that.
Jist hold and ignore and see if in 10 years time after a few more coubtries have shifted or collapsed if there isnt a large portion of the gold investor also secure some portion of their wealth in bitocin. If there is it should be worth about $200,000 per bitcoin.
So print your paper wallet and put in the safe deposit box or wherever and hold. 
(dont just ignore it on a computer wallet becuase too many tech changes can make finding and getting it in ten years very hard. Could YOU resurect your old dos computer hard drive today if there was suddenly aot of money on it? I thought not. Hell i couldnt remember how to fire up my old miners from a year or two ago the other day and i still worry more about my phone wallet encrpyting my bitcoins so i cnat get them or losing them in a wallet change than anything else.)

The way bitcoin will eventually become the reserve currency of tue world is by taking the uncertainty out of each countires currency risk one by one ans each exoerinces a crisis.
Last year it was greek wealth.
Now chinese.
With each utilization as a wealth reserve it will gain history in that function. 
Then more and more  weslth holders in more nations tuat face currency and wealth challenges will turn to it as a CONSERVATIVE  wealth store.  This is what we really want. We want bitcoin to be used as gold 2.0.
This is what will give it real value. Not tranactions.
Transactions get you some visibility but scared big wealth turning to bitcoin get you huge valuations. When total bitcoin gross valuation becomes equal to that of total gold you are at over $150,000 per bitcoin  and that is where we are headed eventually.
Thats what we want 
And of course bitcoin is perfect  for that becuase its quantity is limited and truly rare and virtually uncontrolable by any central player or government .

However even if they create a banking blockchain it will still boost bitcoin because tit willontinue to be seen b more and more serious financial people as a serious thing and they will look at it and say "hmm. $300,000 per coin intrinsic value...and its at $230...."

Well i am not one who beleives the anewer to increasing bitcoin value is to get more merchants using it.

I beleive the person to reach is the person who wants to use bitcoin to store value and while usage is part of that, its only a small part as with owning gold.

You are wrong.
Products get adopted based on EMOTIONAL appeal not factual statements.
Thats part of what has been wrong so far.
.there isnt a shortage of explainatory bitcoin marketing material.
There is a complete lack of emotional marketing.
The Marlboro Man ads worked so well to sell death sticks becuaee every man who lit up imqgined themselves being the tough rugged cowboy on the range.
  People adopt the image of what a product makes them not the product itself.
Right now the image of a bitcoin owner is the guy who spent the most time in his moms basement and got lucky.
We need to change that image into something that men who DONT own bitcoin want to emulate.

Fathead seems to presume the results from mcds was from the meat. It wasnt .
It was the sugar and carbs. Spurlock ate all the supersize fries and sugar sodas mcds suggested. THAT is what caused him helath problems.
At the end of supersize me spurlock clealry points out a man who he met in mcdonlads who eats mcdonals big macs or quarter pounders ( i cant remember which) but no fries or carbs for every meal and the guy is skinny as a rail.
So fathead refutes something sputlock never claimed.

But advertising works over time.
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:10:14
So this going to be advertised like crazy on CNN and then air on Feb 19th.
I expect demand and understanding for bitcoin to increase quite a bit when people realize it is still around and more importantly you can actually live off of it  and earn it and do fun things with it.
Remember the last most people heard about bitcoin was that it had crashed and was worthless (not true but that is the way the mainstream news presented it)
Also its clear from the promo that he does mention that you can do illicit thing swith it and i actually beleive that, even though most people wont want it for that , the huge majority of people will actually find the fake danger and illicit prospects of it very cool and appealling and that will add to its appeal just like tatoos, motorcycles, movies about snipers , and gun ownership, black clothes, stubbly beards,   and smokers. American culture is drawn to symbols of danger associated with macho  and rulebreaking. If bitcoin gets macho then the sky is the limit on the public appeal in america.
In fact let me be the first to say if you dont have some bitcoin you are a pussy and cant really purchase anything worldwide. You have no global reach. You cannot protect or provide for your women. You cant survive independently and arent independent.
Ladies if your man doesnt have some bitcoin then he cant handle anything and has no danger sex appeal. He isnt edgy and there is nothing interesting about him.
Someone needs to do a new bitcoin ad campaign promoting these ideas.  People buy products becuase of the people associated with them who they want to be like.
I notice bitcoin has gone ffrom about $217  to $245 recently and i wonder if it is becuase of the these advertisements ru ning on cnn.

@_date: 2015-02-02 10:39:04
Long term price is important.
 But bitcoin is still basically unknown to the vast majority of people.
Buying some bitcoin now is like buying some early google stock  in a private placement before the public really has learned how good the google search engine was.
And one thing really nice about cryptocurreny is you CAN buy in just as early as the most connected person.
Some other cyrptos may have some advatnages but i firmly beleive that bitcoin will be one of the ones that is carried into the mainstream when the mainstreeam finally comees on board. When that happens bitcoin will rise to prices and yields unmatchable in other investments.
We got a small tiny taste of that rise power last december .  Its clear when the general public becomes aware they will leap in.  
I have a five year hold plan for bitcoin.  I simple wont look at it unless five years have passed or it has hit $50,000 per coin before then. My ultimate target is around $100,000 based on my beleof bitcoi  will be seen as a store of wealth with some great advantages over gold.
 All the price gyrations are  aresult of a very immature market. A huge variation in public knowledge vaired by press coverage and occasional peaks in price and different price plateuas where large coin holders liquidate. They are rubble on the road of the hill climb.  There will be more.  When bitcoin is talked about by every portfolio manager and your local charles schwab investor has it as part of everyones portfolio then and only then will i begjn to look at pricing as a true sign of where the public thinks this will all ultimately end up.
Therefore i beleive penetrstion is a far more important indicator than price. After penetrstion is universal it is likely there will be little rise in price and bitcoin will be a medium of exchange and a store of wealth. Until then it is a great investment with an unmatched potential for upside.
