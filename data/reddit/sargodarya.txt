Hey there Aussiehash,
up until now there is something on airbnb in german. I still need to translate it and put it on a separate site.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:46:20
Sorry, for the late response. Expected was around 320.000€ which is around 435.000$ so at the current exchange rate around 725 BTC. If you're interested I can translate some of the german information into english.
@_date: 2014-06-22 12:10:29
Thanks for the suggestion but 5% is way too much.
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:10:16
It's more like what knowledge is needed. I'm kinda open to learning lots of new stuff.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:53:32
Well, that's not the listing for buying but selling bitcoins and it only means they accept payments made from a spain bank.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:56:31
Just buy a slice of cake somewhere and make a photo ;) Copying images of google doesn't count.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:55:13
Looks good :)
@_date: 2013-04-30 12:57:54
Yeees, I think you can still get toys from there for your toddler but.. well.. better not.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:16:36
Not including shipping I guess?
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:24:34
Not really a real slice.. hmm..
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:25:21
Wow, thanks. That was my first received tip \o/
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:46:59
Well then, nevermind. Local pickup probably would be quite expensive (Germany)
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:38:27
You probably need a local server though because it will complain about accessing domains from a different protocol if you wont.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:56:20
Thanks :) That looks pretty awesome, you actually just got the last slice ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:55:50
You can still buy one, even a cupcake counts ;)
@_date: 2013-04-30 12:18:28
I haven't but the guys who made this shop (bitcoinsberlin) are doing a number of shops like toys4btc and they seem to be quite nice. I had some problems with the payment on the first time though but they contacted me and everything worked out.
If you're not sure have a look at the imprint 
@_date: 2013-05-14 12:30:27
bitshitbear.com would be an appropriate domain.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:25:47
Thanks a lot and this one also made me laugh quite a lot. I think I can share some large slice for this.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:14:59
Damn, I'm sitting in the office and was close to laughing when I clicked on that link xD Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:58:36
Thought it might be a fun idea to do this.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:38:27
Love those guys, they're funny as hell and thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:51:20
Yes, forgot about that. Seems like everything is virtualized. I'm not quite sure I like that setup though.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:54:11
God, I love blueberry muffins... &lt;3
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:32:14
And 64 cores are utterly stupid as the order book can only run single-threaded. The only thing which makes sense in there is 96GB of RAM, the Raid System and the Networking. The bottleneck is their lame as f*ck trading engine.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:14:12
You made this? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:02:03
Thanks, trust me when I say mine is not really better xD
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:06:36
Nyan thanks :) funny idea
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:01:33
I might have to look out for that the next time I'm shopping. That sure looks good.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:27:49
Still plenty of party seats left ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:11:53
Thanks but you should buy a piece of cake or something like that ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:27:28
That looks tasty too. Enjoy the piece :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:48:53
Was a bit sceptic at first because of the small image but then figured it out. Congrats to her too ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:51:04
Thanks though .. and sent ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:53:51
Thanks a lot, I guess there will be lots of cake!
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:54:28
Thanks a lot. That might actually happen ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:44:18
Thanks a lot, that sure looks tasty. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:11:21
Thanks, I'm over in germany.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:35:52
Looks great and thank you very much :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:53:38
Oh yes, I also liked Jack Bauer very much. They should definitely do more seasons of 24 and the cake of course looks good :) Hope you enjoy the slice of cake :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:30:30
I guess not unless it's a math captcha.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:35:54
Yeah, it made me a bit suspicious that the account is also less than a day old.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:58:14
Read the rules first ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:53:54
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:47:55
Thanks, the pie from my mum actually looks bad too but it tastes good so I guess this one tastes even better ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:18:19
Thank you :) you have to post the result then though ;)
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:49:16
Guys, it's a block.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:49:04
It's not and there still is plenty of cake left ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:46:09
Nice, now make it either yourself or buy a real one which is not copied of google ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:01:09
Good enough, hope it's tasty :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:05:21
It doesn't make sense to put order books into the cloud as they simply can't scale because they need to run single threaded.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:57:35
I honor that with an extra slice ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:49:45
Hehe, thanks. I guess if I let chocolate water bottle count I can let this count to ;)
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:54:16
First things first... this is fucking nice and an order has already been placed.
- Price tags are hiding the image making it sometimes quite hard to see how the item looks.
- The paginator could be styled better.
- It sometimes seems to switch between loading more items and the paginator.
- When it loads more items it doesn't display the prices in BTC anymore.
edit: and it seems my payment didn't get through for some reason :/
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:46:02
Danke danke ;) I guess I'll let that count. I have some friends and most of my family over there in berlin.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:52:25
Wow, that's really awesome. Hm.. both? :&gt;
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:52:35
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:22:21
Let the winner answer a mathematical question. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:53:04
How exactly would one do a toblerone cake? And thanks of course :)
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:46:55
And then there is the up-to-date Java plugin...
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:36:47
Why aren't you using the streaming API? It's a lot better actually.
@_date: 2013-04-30 12:19:06
Bought something on one of the other sites from them. It's legit.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:03:01
In that case ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:59:00
\o/ There you go :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:03:08
This looks shopped. I can tell from some of the pixels. Ok.. half a slice for trying.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:13:58
That... Oh god it looks so tasty... Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:59:00
Thank you, you should've received a slice
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:43:53
Kinda reminds me of [this](
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:59:37
Thanks :) and a bonus piece for effort \o/
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:52:20
I'm not Canadian (german) either but have read about it some time ago.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:48:16
In all honesty I wouldn't run all that on a single powerhorse.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:56:17
Fair enough, although it looks more like a small bite hehe
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:55:21
Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:54:58
Pie is a pie is a pie, pie, pie pie pie pie.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:28:51
Hm.. that looks a bit fake to be honest :/
edit: shame on you for trying to loot some slice of the cake this way.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:31:18
The problem with Gox isn't really the DDoS. Gox bottleneck is their trading engine and the flood of 0.01 ask and bids they get. You could also see that while the site got their DDoS the trading engine was still working but flooded with 0.01 orders which in turn basically is valid traffic.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:05:59
Easy if you use Cloudflare or Prolexic (which they actually use)
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:54:37
Thanks a lot :) Have a nice slice of cake ;)
@_date: 2013-03-25 12:25:37
All it would take would be someone to provide a payment gateway for pizza.de or lieferhelden.de
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:47:39
Problem with the order book is that it has to execute the orders in order and you can't really do that without syncing the threads which in turn would mean that you run 2 threads which do exactly the same. The only thing it would do in this case is increase the load so that makes no sense.
Networking makes sense as there are lots of connections going in.
96GB RAM makes sense because the order book has to maintain the state of all orders which there are lots of. Although I'm quite certain the server is split up into multiple virtual machines so the cores actually make some kind of sense but everything is split up.
I'd really like to see how their architecture looks like. Probably everything is virtualized on that one server.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:12:52
Don't spend it on shady websites though ;)
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:44:13
How much in btc do you want?
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:45:26
That's indeed no valid adress and looks more like a private key to me.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:37:48
If live gives you onions.. wait.. nah.. who cares. Onion Lemonade for everyone \o/
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:36:39
Not as good as a real one but still appreciated ;)
