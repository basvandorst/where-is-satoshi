Just got the chills! 
This is incredibly well thought out and very professional. The "what about banking?" infinite suggestion is so bluddy deep. The whole thing cross references Nier and Bitcoin in an especially ironic way, as this is the first form of currency that can be autonomously traded by bots; you've suggested that the robots actually want this revolution to happen, shit that's very clever. 
The roger ver interview, hahahaha, jesus there tonnes of stuff here. 




Very well done!

Glad it held up for you.
I didn't know it was Square, makes sense now as I couldn't believe Platinum would drop support for a game like that.

I still don't understand the limitation to a 21 million cap when it is still being mined, I've still got LOTS to read. But surely if there is a limitation in availability, people will start adopting homogeneous variants of btc and use them when and where they are accepted?
Edit. Jesus, it already has a predetermined deflationary end point at 21 million built in!

I'll try and dig it out of my history for you; it might be blockchain vs bullshit, but I'm not so sure.

It's not news, the article (generous by English standards) is from the most loathed and disreputable news outlets in UK tabloid media. 
Just look up what they did with Hillsborough to get a flavour of their taste.

Replying to my original comment. I've read up and do not use Tails OS for any personal information as it anonymizes the user but at a cost of the users security. 
Mint OS seems the way to go on a bootable disk.

That Nier review had me in stitches, nice touch!

If you're still wondering this is a very good article from medium.com

Given the volatility of the entire market it would require some serious balls + a serious amount of ammo, most likely collectively held to tank the market to have any effect, but we have seen mass drops before so don't be too surprised. No investment vehicle backed by an institution would attempt to game the market when it regularly tracks up and down in the high teens% though so we are likely looking at individual players. 
However given the divergence in BTC's fundamental value away from its intrinsic one, it is pretty undeniable that the market is experiencing an exponential and euphoric romp with behavioral economics. Thus for the people who can see this, if they hold enough power they can dump the market and profit from the basic principals of things like shorting.
Government structures would likely outlaw a form of commerce they found threatening rather than utilise funds in a speculative attempt at crashing it, they only need businesses to be onside if people are using it as an alternative to fiat.

I think the consensus is under no circumstances to ever use windows and to use Linux or a Mac (as Macs are built on BSD IIRC). I'm going to use Tails OS on a USB drive when buying crypto.

Thanks, can't wait to get started. The archived stuff from 2014 will be interesting to read in light of how the response is at present.
Thanks again.

It will be a true test of those that believe in the technology who will stay, it wont be flat lets just say that.

I never even heard of the fella before, bought it on a whim and my Christ it's something else. I wasn't expecting anything like it and the best thing is, it's incredibly memorable for the story; Jesus, I even remember meeting a robot named Jean Paul who was an existentialist, beautiful. 
It's one of the few games I've played where you forget about the functions of life: eating, sleeping, shitting.

'The current economic system which has rinsed every one of us for generations.'
Couldn't have put it better myself Rob.

I think you need to look up the term hyperinflation followed by Zimbabwe, Venezuela and Germany during the Weimar days.

Does your interest in this subject wane for those who have been reading/known about it for a while, and where the fuck is the ceiling for this thing (how high it can be applied, not how vulnerable it is), as a practical concept it seems almost limitless?
I just can't get the information in me quick enough.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:52:19
Gosh, this fella looks like he knows what he's talking about. Thank you for your suggestion. This is brilliant.

Crush the banks, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women.

Finally gets 'legitimised' in a traditional economic sphere. It opens the doors to options which does not require one to hold the stock to partake in the trade; you can speculate the price will go up or down and reap the rewards but it is fraught with risk. There is an argument that it will stabilise the market with the added security of trading in an institutional sense, the other side of the coin is that options trading is risky at the best of times and requires either inside knowledge or high speculation bordering on gambling. 
Ask yourself this, how can you go long on something that no one can put a price on, a thing which isn't actually being used, therefore the only sensible option for those willing to partake in this new endeavour is to short; at least with gold there is there is the secondary market for jewelry and fashion which can prop up its underlying value but with BTC (currently) the thing that gives it its purpose as a **currency** is being deprived by those that are HODLing, thus we are presented with this ever inflating balloon.

Of all the people who have bought BTC in the Mania Phase, how many have not read up and understood the fundamentals of use and the potential of it, because if it is enough the mean will be of a far higher trajectory than the first sell off period listed above?
It seems different to me than the internet bubble, as the dissemination of information is so much more widespread than early 2000s thus people (in theory) should be more informed thus a higher uptake when it corrects itself.

Both technologies are similar in terms of rapid rise in market cap and inherent technological value, IPOs making employees who received stock options instant millionaires, and static 0% interest rates in both instances. 
The failing (in the short term) I can see in both is the adoption rate; there was no doubting the potential reach of the dotcom industries, nor for those that understand the problems with transaction costs, trust, monetary policy ect... in bitcoin, there is no denying that this is a much better model than the current fiat system. 
People are seeing the potential before the applicability of bitcoin; there is no way to tie its value to it and as such we have no present utility value for bitcoin as it was initially intended, an alternative means of transaction to fiat based system. Thus we arrive at a market fulled by rampant speculation and circular logic.

What did you play it on, I lucky picked it up on PS4 but read after that the PC version was full of holes due to lack of updates and poor optimisation, don't know if that's still the case though.
