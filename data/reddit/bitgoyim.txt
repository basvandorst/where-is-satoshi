Right now many more people are entering than exiting suggesting the natural equilibrium exchange rate for bitcoin in dollars (i.e. price) is much lower. There is no free lunch in the long run. During a crash the Prisoner's Dilemma will incentivize people to sell their coins before the next guy does.

Yes, all you need is either the seed or the private keys to recover your wallet. If you are using Windows, which is prone to malware, you can even create an Electrum wallet, transfer your coins there, save the seed on a piece of paper and then delete the wallet file so there is nothing for a hacker to steal. When you want to spend your coins simply regenerate the wallet from the seed. An easier solution is just to use a password on the wallet file but make sure you don't save the password in clear text on your computer somewhere.

TLDR: At some point in the future Bitcoin price will need to decline if holders ever want to spend their investment. In this way it is kind of like a Ponzi scheme and is not a store of value because it does not, and will not, have the backing of the broader society, because they have more to lose than gain by it.
HODLING is ill advised. Game Theory (Prisoners' Dilemma) indicates hodling won't hold in the long run.
***You should take your gains while you can*** you have had luck similar to a lottery winner.
I support some of the general idea of Bitcoin but I think that the speculative action going on now that is driven by the exchanges will ultimately be harmful and will collapse, probably sooner than later. The volatility that exchanges are cultivating could blow up the coin at any time.
As the value of a Bitcoin increases the incentive to clone or fork it also increases. Each clone or fork decreases the value of Bitcoin. The original blockchain is indeed a limited good but it is not unique. The idea of an SHA-256 encrypted blockchain is not particular to any one token. The very same machines that mine (process transactions for) Bitcoin can be used to mine any other SHA-256 coin. By contrast gold is a truly unique relatively scarce element so can serve as money. I am not saying it should or should not. I am just saying that Bitcoin is not truly scarce in the sense that gold is. It is also possible that in the future an algorithmic weakness will be found in SHA-256 or that quantum computers, if they can be built, will be able to quickly decrypt it. Other algorithms or proofs of work may turn out to be superior to SHA-256. There are already several alternatives like Scrypt, for example.
If there is a real commerce, as opposed to speculative, demand for a Bitcoin like financial instrument then the one with lowest cost and most efficiency of use will ultimately win out. Value stored in $10,000 Bitcoin is not worth much if it can't be spent on a large scale by the majority of holders, i.e. exchanged for goods or services or sold for fiat, without driving down the value toward $100 or lower. There is no intrinsic value in a Bitcoin besides what is transactionally useful for and not much can currently can be purchased without currency conversion. There is no reason why market price can not crash in the future. If there is a demand for Bitcoin-like assets substitutes will arise until the marginal benefit of forking / cloning equals the marginal cost of doing so (almost zero for non-holders).
Ultimately money is about the power to allocate scarce resources in society. A global Bitcoin economy would arbitrarily assign a disproportionate amount of power to early adopters, disregarding real merit or skill, at the expense of everyone else. The broad swath of society won't accept this so it won't happen. What we consider money arises from a broad social consensus. People already complain about the 99% many of whom are self-made through their own work not just lottery winners. Society will not accept a new elite made of OG CypherPunks. So the left out people will make their own coins or nation sates will issue coins and make them legal tender. If enough people accept the new coins in exchange for goods and services then that will depreciate the real value purchasing power of BTC.
The current dollar value of Bitcoin is a mirage due to lack of people spending it and speculative demand possibly primed or pumped by Tether funny money and the hype surrounding Ethereum and its myriad ICO offspring.
When / if people want to spend their Bitcoin wealth they will need to sell it for their national currency decreasing the value of Bitcoin. Your investment is worth nothing if you can not spend it at some point in the future. On a long time horizon the chance your Bitcoin holdings will have less purchasing power they do today is almost certain because of events and new innovations that you and I can not foresee. Therefore it makes sense to not be greedy and capture the gains you have now before the bubble bursts because when it does you could be left with nearly nothing from your investment.

This post seems fake to me. A computer science professor would know better than to fear that his retirement account would be threatened by Bitcoin. Lol. 
Do you noobs know that Bitcoin is almost 10 years old?  You are late to the party.
If it was going to take the world by storm it would have already happened. Internet based technologies move rapidly. In fact in 2013-2014 it was catching on in China. Then the government passed a rule that it could not be used as legal currency.
Why did Japan make Bitcoin legal currency recently? They needed to for the Mt. Gox / Karpeles Trial. 
The fact is that Bitcoin is useful for making pseudo-anonymous trustless payments over the Internet. Other than that it is a solution in search of a problem. Most people don't need to hide who they transact with. Centralized payments networks like Visa **will always** be faster than distributed networks. There are some other clear problems but I will keep them secret in case I want to make Bitcoin 2.0 (a bitcoin that works). Bitcoin Legacy is a good start. I do believe there is a use for peer to peer payments but it can be done better than Bitcoin and it is not reasonable to expect any electronic peer to peer payments to replace existing systems completely. Personally I prefer cash for daily use. It is instant and easier than anything else. On the Internet I prefer Bitcoin where available. Where not I can use Paypal or Credit Cards. Paypal and Credit cards are better at dealing with vendor fraud.

You can print the private keys to the wallet or you can write down the seed that will regenerate the wallet if your computer crashes. It is utterly important to keep your private keys and or seed secret because anyone who has access to them can regenerate your wallet and steal your coins. Your wallet file should also be encrypted (password protected) if using a desktop wallet.

If you have the private keys. For example if you hold your coins in an electrum wallet or a paper wallet or Trezor, etc. You are not required to use the exchanges to participate in the BTC market. In fact I think the exchanges will be the short term downfall of BTC. Regulation is coming. Over the counter and keeping the coins in your own wallet is the best. Make sure you keep them in an offline computer or on a removable disk, etc. You don't want to get hacked. Google "electrum." Personally I think it is the best BTC wallet out there for desktop computers if you can secure yourself against hackers sufficiently.

Why not any of the current or future altcoins? Gold is fundamentally unique and has thousands of years of history as a store of value behind it while Bitcoin is not unique and is a novelty. 
Why would the hodler not sell the top and buy the bottom rather than just hold all the way down?
How does the increasing concentration of BTC into old hands (from buying dips as you describe) effect its utility as a currency? I am sorry but BTC will never gain wide acceptance by society and it will crash once the novelty wears off. Something with less arbitrarily concentrated holding may take over as a global currency. The only reason there is a speculative bubble in BTC is because people expect deflation. Deflation will only occur in the long run if usage stays constant or increases. If BTC is increasingly concentrated into fewer hands then its use (and thus exchange rate) will tend to decrease crashing the price. If one guy creates a token and owns all of its units it is not very valuable if worth anything. If one guy creates a token an 500 of his friends own tokens it is still not very valuable. If millions of people own a token but over time 10,000 people end up owning 99% of the token and don't spend it, the token will not have much use as a currency. If several of those 10,000 people want to spend their holdings it crashes the price, etc.
A fixed supply can't work as money in the long run because it tends to amplify arbitrary wealth distributions over time and thus does not respond to the changing needs of society. The majority who are left out will simply create their own token and call it money. If enough accept it in exchange for goods and services it becomes valuable.

Synthetic diamonds a very difficult to form and are typically much smaller and less valuable than natural ones. This is because of the intense pressure required for carbon atoms to assume the lattice structure of diamonds. Larger diamonds are harder to synthesize than small ones due to the increased surface area requiring more absolute force applied to generate the same pressures (e.g. PSI). As far as I know the market for synthetic diamonds is based solely on industrial uses (e.g. abrasives, etc).

In the context of Crypto tokens such moves may be seen as normal and healthy. In the context of real world money, such as Bitcoin seems to aspire to, it is absurd and unworkable. Exchanges will be the downfall of Bitcoin. It is only a matter of time before bad actors or overleverage or sudden correlations (e.g. black swan) bring down an exchange. What is going on with Tether is, from appearances, pumping a speculative bubble by essentially printing money. Without a real audit of their accounts people are just taking them at their word. What if their USD balances are loans and because of some external reason the banks lending to them need to withdraw credit. Tether collapses and the air goes out of the crypto balloon. There is no legitimate reason why Tether should not be thoroughly and publicly audited. It seems unlikely the growth in Tethers this year is due to new real USD deposits due to their banking problems. So where are they getting the cash they say they have to back their token?

It is easier for an established elite to maintain its position than for a new elite to replace it. Simple social inertia. If you do not think the elite could stop Bitcoin if it really took off you are mistaken. The elite are wealthy in the current economic order. They have no interest in overturning things and potentially threatening their position. Look at the power of lobbyists for various things today. You don't think the banks could lobby against Bitcoin if they saw it as real threat? They could and they don't. Therefore it is not going anywhere. Surely long time insiders like Jamie Dimon know what they are talking about.

What is so revolutionary about Bitcoin that the establishment does not get? Is there a great unmet demand for an encrypted and distributed ledger in mainstream commerce as opposed to money laundering, tax evasion, dealing in black markets? Outside of exchange speculation the current largest use of Bitcoin is in the dark markets. Maybe it is even larger than the exchanges. When I use a credit card all the transactions are logged in a ledger. The sale is instant and there is even the option for chargeback in the case of fraud. There is no need to encrypt the ledger because it describes legal transactions. I am sure VISA or whoever backs up their databases so the chance of the record of the transaction being lost is small. If I want to deal with an international counterparty such as  a manufacturer in China, I can use an escrow service and transfer money via Wire or Check. International money transfers could be made easier by a technology like Bitcoin but they would be fiat to fiat transfers. There is no need to invent a new currency to have the blockchain ledger as a trustless value transfer mechanism. That is the direction this will go. There is no way sovereign currencies are going away in the near future. In fact the world seems to be becoming increasingly less globalized with things like Brexit and Trumpian nativism. Barriers of trade have not fallen. Governments still want to collect import duties. How would this work in a bitcoin economy?

I agree with you. Bitcoin is in an insane bubble based on mass delusions of scarcity, uniqueness, and usefulness. Any other SHA-256 coin could take over the machines that run the BTC network. See the recent drama with BCH. If BCH had significant real world merchant usage it could easily displace BTC because it runs on the same hardware. Wait until a nation state, like the USA mints a Cryptodollar that is based on an SHA-256 blockchain. Who would spend Bitcoins when you could spend cryptodollars? Who would hold something they could not spend and was an uncertain store of value?

Current crypto valuations are based on the greater fool (Ponzi Scheme) principle, unfortunately. The technology is fascinating and potentially very useful but the "community" is toxic, immature, and greedy. There is no such thing as a free lunch. If I had bought 50 BTC a few years ago I would be worth 500,000 USD today. What real work would I have done to attain that purchasing power? Bitcoin seems like the black hole sucking up excess fiat. If interest rates were not so low for so long after the 2008 financial collapse: almost ten years ago and we still have excess money supply there would not be a demand for Bitcoin as speculative asset because there would be less money to purchase it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:23:38
Intrinsic has to do with real world usefulness. Bitcoin is predominantly bought now, at least by new investors, to speculate on future Bitcoin prices. That is not an intrinsic value and can evaporate at any time due to a crisis of confidence. It may happen soon due to CME futures. Now people who want to speculate on Bitcoin don't need to buy the coin they can just buy the futures contract. That will reduce the demand for BTC.

Diamonds and rubies and other precious metals are qualitatively different from base materials. A diamond has an intrinsic value and  natural scarcity that rubber does not. By contrast the intrinsic value  or usefulness of any given cryptocurrency is essentially the same as another. The various coins are not really qualitatively different in a significant sense. Bitcoin is simply valuable now because it is popular. There is no fundamental reason why another coin may not become more popular in the future. Bitcoin is not proprietary and the cost creating a clone (forking) is very low, especially if you don't own Bitcoin. It is true that relatively more merchants accept Bitcoin now than anything else but in the context of the larger economy only an infinitesimal percentage of merchants accept any coin at all. So the first mover advantage is not that strong. It is likely that in the future point of sale systems will not be tied to any particular coin and will be reprogrammable.

I think crypto does have a future but the value is in its applications not in expecting ever increasing token prices from get rich quick ICOs. I am not sure if the successful cryptos will end up having a fixed supply or will rather be pegged to something external in the real economy. I think fixed supply creates an artificial scarcity that tends to allow these speculative pricing bubbles such as we are currently in to form. Economically it should not be possible for you to buy a non-productive, non-equity asset and expect it to just increase in value over time. There is no economic function in the value appreciation of cryptocoins other than to arbitrarily redistribute wealth from late adopters to early adopters, kind of like a Ponzi scheme. I have not read up too much on ETH and I am not familiar with Cardano except that he was a Renaissance Italian Algebraist. One problem I have read about ETH is that its Turing complete smart contract language is susceptible to programming errors or bugs.

1. If the alt coins did not exist would Bitcoin have larger or smaller market share? Are the alt coins substitutes for certain use cases of Bitcoin? If so how does the existence of alternatives not reduce demand for Bitcoin and thus exert a downward effect on price?
2. Other hashing algorithms may be faster, less energy intensive, more secure, or less susceptible to mining hardware centralization (see the rise of the Chinese ASIC manufacturer / market leader Bitmain). If a coin had its own proof of work that it did not share with other coins this might protect it better from being over taken by a fork (see BCH vs BTC), thus improving it as a store of value in the long run.
3. By no intrinsic value I mean no unique intrinsic value. The network is composed of software and hardware. The software can be re-written and the existing hardware can support any SHA-256 proof of work coin. If a government, such as China, wanted to make a dent in Bitcoin they could develop their own SHA-256 proof of work coin for the Yuan and allow the miners to use their hardware as a means of uncovering the coins with cryptoyuans as their reward.
4. Our society purports to be a democracy. If people feel that wealth is too centralized in one group or another they are free to elect politicians who support different tax, trade, and monetary policies. If monetary policy is controlled by who hold the bitcoin there is less or no room for that kind of flexibility.

Read Google "Bitfinexed." Excercise due dilligence before getting in. If you do decide to get in I would recommend buying over the counter at  It is safer and easier than an exchange. All you have to do is set up a wallet to receive the coins. If an exchange goes down (e.g. bankrupt) or is hacked you do not have to worry about loosing your coins. If you keep coins on an exchange, especially at this time, your risk of loosing them is much increased over keeping coins offline with proper security. You don't really control your coins if you don't have them in your own wallet (have the private keys). Also if Bitcoin forks again you do not receive the forked coins (at least within a reasonable time frame) if you keep your investment in an online wallet such as at Coinbase or Blockchain.info.

I sold all my Bitcoins this week. The explosion in volatility did not make risking my gains worth it to me. I am fortunate I got (not earned) what I did from investing early in this year. I always took it as a highly speculative investment. Yes indeed it is a quasi-religious mania / cargo cult. What in particular triggered my decision to sell now was reading about the uncertainty surrounding BitFinex and Tether. (See An exchange blowing up could easily pop the bubble. The risk was not worth it to me and I could not find a fundamental reason to justify the current valuation. There was recently an article in the NY Times about the uncertainty surround Tether and a BCH guy on the claimed he contacted USA Financial Crimes Law enforcement on the issue. Even though Bitfinex / Tether are not based in the USA they need access to USD to function effectively. Their banking connections have been severed since the Spring. If they are receiving USD through informal channels that may be considered money laundering, etc. There is just too much uncertainty in that added to the fact that the current spot price of Bitcoin is entirely irrational considering of its lack of significant actual usage for things besides speculation.

First, currencies don't have market cap because they are not equities like stocks are. You are not buying a share of ownership in property or a business by buying Bitcoin. What determines the value of currencies are exchange rate (relative valuation) and velocity (usage rate in the economy) and supply. People say that Bitcoin has a limited supply but that is not really true because it can be forked. 
If Bitcoin is not a currency then it is a speculative asset on a parabolic upswing. So caveat emptor.
I agree the stock market is an inflationary ponzi scheme for the most part. Athough it may be overvalued Apple is a real enterprise that produces products and earns money. Bitcoin is a speculative asset that may increase or **decrease** in value in the future in real terms depending on how many people use it and what they are willing to pay and how many similar coins there are out there. As it is now it is not that useful except for sending large sums of money to another country quickly. 
I think that the Bitcoin rise this year is the culmination of the FED overly increasing the money supply for many years since 2009-2010. Easy (cheap) money makes it so many questionable ideas receive outsize backing. For example Juciero was Silicon Valley IOT Juicer start up. It raised something like $120,000,000 in VC funding before the company realized there was not really a broad market for a $1000 dollar app driven Juicer. 
Just because something attracts money does not necessarily mean it will ultimately succeed. Almost unanimously intelligent people in the areas of business, finance, and economics have said that Bitcoin is a bubble. Its current price is the primary driver of its continued price rise. That pattern will eventually reverse, violently, unless Bitcoin can find more of a use. Sure transactions and user numbers are increasing but I would argue that is primarily through increased speculation not, for example, because of significantly increased merchant adoption.
2017 the year of Trump is an anti-elitist time. So the anarchic (or trustless) ethos of bitcoin fits the Zeitgeist.

1. Maybe the BTC price exploded short term because (a) people are buying BTC with their fork-coins increasing the demand for BTC and, more importantly, (b) things not directly correlated with the forks such as increased media attention and possibly Bitfinex bidding up the price through unbacked Tethers. After a short term demand spike one would expect the continued competition from forks to put a downward pressure on BTC prices.
2. I know that SHA256 is secure from a mathematical point of view (to the best of our knowledge). I am not sure it is an optimal hashing algorithm.
3. Congratulations on your gains from BTC increasing in price. I hope you diversify and hedge against things that you or I don't see coming in the future.
4. I don't vote either but the idea that the Fed is some dark and nefarious cabal is absurd. They are mostly academic economists who are not people strongly driven by money or power lust. If people don't like the current monetary policy of the Fed the most efficient way to change it is to work through the existing political framework rather than try to create an alternative currency. If the present elite is so powerful that voting and political engagement is futile why do you assume they will just allow a noveau Bitcoin elite to take over? You don't think the existing system's stakeholders will put up effective resistance? What would make the existing global financial elite buy into Bitcoin when it would threaten their position?

I have no idea why people use the words "market cap" for Bitcoin. It has no market cap because it is not an equity. Yes money has been poured into it and the aggregate of all Bitcoins does have (illusory) current market value (i.e. speculation driven price) but that does not translate into ***lasting*** spending power. If the majority of hodlers tried to spend their Bitcoin the price of BTC/USD would collapse. What use is a currency if you can not spend it? What is the value of an investment or asset that you can not cash out? No one knows what the future holds. If Bitcoin is a currency then the what matters is its usage and the purchasing power claim on real goods and services. A fictitious market cap based off current exchange rates means nothing. The price of BTC/USD has shot up because of resale price driven demand and limited supply. When people want to spend their earnings supply will increase. If Bitcoin is an asset or a commodity what is its intrinsic value: its intrinsic value is that it is useful as a currency and other people value it.

Under the Bitcoin system the shopper would pay the fee. There is still a fee to use a payments processing network. Depending on the elasticity of the shopper's demand for whatever he is buying he may require a discount or buy less to compensate for the fee. So the shop owner is in the net no better off.

On many exchanges you can buy the top alts directly from fiat.
From a technical perspective and a value perspective Litecoin will be a much better investment during 2018 than BTC. Litecoin is the second oldest crypto. It is functionally almost identical to Bitcoin but the transaction processing is much faster and and the total number of coins is 4 four times that Bitcoin will have. Under the hood litecoin uses a different proof of work called Scrypt but it is no less secure than SHA-256. For an almost identical product Litecoin is trading at a significant, and irrational, discount. It is at about $100 a coin while BTC is at 10,000+. Rationally 1 LTC should be about 0.25 BTC. If Litecoin grows to even half of this it would be a great ROI  1250 / 100 = 1250 % return. Then again the whole crypto bubble could burst at any time because it is essentially about vaporware with little usage demand and currently absurd levels of speculative demand. Crypto is almost 10 years old. If there were a real demand in the payments sector for something like Crypto coins they would have already taken off. I expect them to remain, niche speculative assets subject to arbitrary price swings up and down with a long term trend toward depreciation.

I am aware of the story. I believe it is no longer as true as it used to be many years ago due to Siberian and Canadian diamond producers as well as West Africa. Large, high quality diamonds *are* rare on the Earth's surface. That there may be an oligopoly in diamonds does not negate that.

We shall see how it pans out. For now it seems that the dumb money is flocking to BTC. Maybe the future is one of idiocracy. 
Bitcoin is not an equity like Amazon or Microsoft stock. It gives you no ownership share over real or intellectual property or a stream of earnings. Bitcoin is not an enterprise. It is an application of open source block chain technology. As such it is neither unique nor truly rare. The same machines that mine BTC can mine any other SHA-256 coin. In the future a coin may come that has greater usefulness than BTC at which time value will migrate from BTC to the new token leaving BTC worthless. The primary support for price now is speculative demand. A healthy currency has an exchange rate with other currencies primarily based on its usage in commerce rather than on exchange rate speculation. Some hiccup will cause BTC to blow up in the short term. In the long run it is not sustainable either. Hodlers would do themselves a service to sell now rather than Hodl all the way down to near zero.
As Warren Buffet (among countless others) has said it is not a value producing asset.

How are you going to wire money to the exchange in another country to buy Bitcoin if your bank won't let you? What if it is illegal to send money out of the country for the purpose of buying Bitcoin? How would you repatriate the funds from selling BTC?
I support some of the general idea of Bitcoin but I think that the speculative action going on now that is driven by the exchanges will ultimately be harmful and will collapse, probably sooner than later.
As the value of a Bitcoin increases the incentive to clone or fork it also increases. Each clone or fork decreases the value of Bitcoin. The original blockchain is indeed a limited good but it is not unique. The idea of an SHA-256 encrypted blockchain is not particular to any one token. The very same machines that mine (process transactions for) Bitcoin can be used to mine any other SHA-256 coin. By contrast gold is a truly unique relatively scarce element so **can** serve as money. I am not saying it should or should not. I am just saying that Bitcoin is not truly scarce in the sense that gold is. It is also possible that in the future an algorithmic weakness will be found in SHA-256 or that quantum computers, if they can be built, will be able to quickly decrypt it.
If there is a real commerce, as opposed to speculative, demand for a Bitcoin like financial instrument then the one with lowest cost and most efficiency of use will ultimately win out. Value stored in $10,000 Bitcoin is not worth much if it can't be spent by the majority of holders, i.e. exchanged for goods or services or sold for fiat, without driving down the value toward $100 or lower. There is no intrinsic value in a Bitcoin besides what is transactionally useful for and not much can currently can be purchased without currency conversion. There is no reason why market price can not crash in the future. If there is a demand for Bitcoin-like assets substitutes will arise until the marginal benefit of forking / cloning equals the marginal cost of doing so (almost zero for non-holders).
Ultimately money is about the power to allocate scarce resources in society. A global Bitcoin economy would arbitrarily assign a disproportionate amount of power to early adopters, disregarding real merit or skill, at the expense of everyone else. The broad swath of society won't accept this so it won't happen. What we consider money arises from a **broad** social consensus. People already complain about the 99% many of whom are self-made through their own work not just lottery winners. Society will not accept a new elite made of OG CypherPunks. So the left out people will make their own coins or nation sates will issue coins and make them legal tender. If enough people accept the new coins in exchange for goods and services then that will depreciate the real value purchasing power of BTC. 
The current dollar value of Bitcoin is a mirage due to lack of people spending it and speculative demand possibly primed or pumped by Tether funny money and the hype surrounding Ethereum and its myriad ICO offspring. 
When / if people want to spend their Bitcoin wealth they will need to sell it for their national currency decreasing the value of Bitcoin. Your investment is worth nothing if you can not spend it at some point in the future. On a long time horizon the chance your Bitcoin holdings will have less purchasing power they do today is almost certain because of events and new innovations that you and I can not foresee. Therefore it makes sense to not be greedy and capture the gains you have now before the bubble bursts.

You know that the dollar is the reserve currency of the world, right? If I shipped a pallet of $100 bills to Yakutsk do you think they would use the paper bundles for firewood? It may not be the dollar. There is a case to be made for a global currency but until trade restrictions are taken down this may not be possible.

The private keys are linked to the transaction (aka public key) where you deposited the coins in your wallet on the blockchain. The seed is particular to your wallet software. If you are recovering using the same wallet program you can use the seed. If you are entering funds into a different wallet program or an online wallet you may need the private keys depending on what seed format it accepts.

Bitcoin is simply a more complicated than usual Ponzi scheme. Sound money does not appreciate in purchasing power 1000% per year. The bubble will burst...soon.

Amazon is trading at somewhere around 300 times current earnings. Shareholders must have a lot of faith in them to justify that premium. In my opinion the proliferation of alt-coins, forks, and ICOs as get rich quick schemes has inflated the BTC bubble as the reserve currency of crypto. The question is how will it pop. The volatility over the past few days indicates a market that is struggling to agree on a price. In healthy markets prices derive from something real or fundamental that is relatively independent of the price of the good itself. Numerous commentators have said that Bitcoin is going parabolic. That means its price growth is powering its own price growth. Essentially the price growth of Bitcoin is generating free money for hodlers from new dollars pouring in. Kind of like a Ponzi scheme. This can go on until Bitcoin eats the financial world, displacing traditional currencies, or until there is a very nasty correction triggered by any moderate sell of. I think that it is more likely that  bitcoin will suffer a correction rather than that it eats the whole global economy at an exponential rate over the next few years. There are too many vested interests in the current system. Maybe a state actor such as the NSA could create malware directed at bitcoin nodes, for example, etc, exchanges can be outlawed. Possession or trading criminalized. I don't support any of this but these are actions the existing system could take to protect itself from a rising Bitcoin. On the other hand maybe it is the Trump of Currencies and everyone will dismiss it but it will keep rising any way. The lack of maturity of many in the "community" disturbs me. They talk online like a bunch of teenagers. But on the other hand most detractors of bitcoin have not bothered to research it either. They routinely cast their judgements based on misconceptions of how bitcoin works or strawmen. An example of a strawman is "gold has real world uses." True but real world uses are dwarfed in importance in comparison to supply and speculative demand when it comes determining market price of gold.

If one considers the valuations of tech stocks such as Amazon or Tesla or Netflicks over present earning they are similarly speculative to Bitcoin. If not for easy money from the Fed stock prices would not be so inflated now.

What is the deal with the ridiculous explosion in volatility over the past three days? Anyone have any insight? Is the "community" (at least in the USA) so unstable and immature that everyone just thinks its time to sell when the price hits a magic number i.e. 10,000 USD. Volatility tends to breed volatility. And it could potentially kill bitcoin. Yes the number of coins is pegged at 21,000,000 but if their relative value against widespread fiat currencies such as USD changes up and down 10% per day they will eventually become worthless as a store of value.
