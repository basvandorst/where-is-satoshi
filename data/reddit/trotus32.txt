so if there are no txs, the nonce would be found faster and hence a new block will be mined faster?
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:58:39
Thats what I thought. :( and internet searches dont yield much results

Mycelium sounds nice, when I get a phone I will probably use that one

Thanks for the rapid response.
I currently have only a Chromebook. In a few months I will have an android phone (last broke a week ago). I do share a computer with windows with my younger brother, but I think it's risky due to malware
Also I have seen that Hive is not among the recomended web Wallets of the [Bitcoin Subredit](

I only know of Bitbond. crowdfunded loans but up to 10000$
@_date: 2016-05-17 22:33:46
So, how's the series??

I don't know how to add a description to the post (I'm stupid and on the Reddit app) 
I want to get some BTC and transfer it to a wallet. Does this fee affect me? It's scary the 0.01% every 4 hours. Much compound much interest

Thanks! Really nice comments. I wasn't planning on trading with it but very interesting. I also saw that the maker and taker fees were very different on GDAX and Kraken. On GDAX the maker has 0% fees (I think)
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:23:43
That's good to hear! Haven't done a tx for a while
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:39:56
So is it 2$ for the burger and 5$ for the tx cost?
