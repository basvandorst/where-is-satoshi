Exactly

That’s what I mean, if you buy something with usd, other than the difference over time from inflation, you will always just have spent that much on it, but imagine those guys from the 2000s who bought a pizza with 10 bitcoin. That’s like 200 000 worth now. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:59:35
Right... because BITCOIN is the most unstable... riiight
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:53:09
Ah okay, so what do I do with them? Sorry I usually just use addresses given my exchange services like binance.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:21:16
More like “oh look I’m rich!, oh wait I’m slightly less rich”
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:02:05
So considering I got it for free, and it’s probably not a significant amount, how could I go about putting it in, say, my binance account 
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:17:14
No I mean how do I get it from paper to online, because the other guy that posted a tutorial above, it doesent work anymore 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:21:05
I never understood buying something with bitcoin. 1usd will always be 1usd, but bitcoin could be worth so much more in the future, it seems like paying for something with shares of a company you know is going to do well.

Bruh. Obviously. But I don’t exactly want to manually convert currencies every time I obsessively check my acc.

Bitcoin cash has gone up a lot lately, in new, can someone explain to me what it’s a trap? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:52:09
Can someone explain how bitcoin is mined, and how it’s a finite “mineral”
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:49:11
but they already did fit, the only change is that it takes up like an inch and a half on the graph, instead of utilizing the whole graph
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:33:45
yeah i know, but it just seems outright silly not to have the option to veiw in CAD when im dealing in 0.0000126454 btc ya know?
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:09:40
Is it now worth more or less though 
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:14:49
I put a dollar or two in doge coin a while ago lmao
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:11:47
What does this mean for people who currently have bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:03:15
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:22:35
R u sure that’s what you want to spend your bitcoin on lol. Just watch some regular free porn
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:27:25
250$ or 250,000$, the decimal instead of comma is kinda confusing 
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:40:42
AHHHHH I bought xrp @ 2.50, went to sell at 3.50, but Binance went down so I couldnt. Havent checked since. I think my 500$ is closer to 100 now...
@_date: 2019-12-08 15:46:50
I bought at 2$, went to sell at the 3.25 peak, exchange crashed, couldn’t sell, woke up next morning at 2.30, figured I’d wait it out.... and look where we are now
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:52:09
The exciting possibility of making money outshines the  comparatively boring long term goal of currency use. Why would someone want 6000$ when they can hodl and it might turn into 12000$!!
@_date: 2018-11-18 05:00:48
Sell them and buy more bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:13:02
If this guy kept even one coin, he’s still wealthy
