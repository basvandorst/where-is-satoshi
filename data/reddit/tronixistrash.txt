if it mines that is very cool
nodes like this that don't mine are useless though
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:12:59
can you explain how non-mining full nodes are valuable? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:53:34
miners run their own full nodes as well. they need to communicate with each other and the rest of the chain as well
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:50:34
Non mining full nodes can "verify" in that they can decide not to propagate transactions that don't follow the rules. However, if miners propagate themselves and decide to build a new block on top of the block you rejected (Through PoW Consensus), then the chain moves on without you and you are simply forked off. Ultimately you don't really do much since you don't participate in consensus. The miners rule the chain.

"I would like to refrain from explaining the details of the method of sale; otherwise thefuture sale of BTC and BCC could be hindered"
this is a lie and makes no sense
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:14:36
he is lying obviously. the 18k movement was a clear panic sale
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:39:46
He is lying obviously; all you have to do is check the transfer times/amounts against the price at those times and the total amount of Fiat he generated. 
He provides no evidence. He can't even vaguely describe the methods he used to sell the coins as he claims this would interfere with further sales (another bs lie). 
He clearly panic sold 18k BTC on Feb 5th
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:15:49
and all you have to do is match the timing, price at those times, amount moved, and total amount of fiat he ended up with.

you are an absolute brainlet. that has nothing to do with him giving a general description of how he sold his coins. Plus it doesn't matter what he does from here on out. Those cold storage wallets are tracked daily and posts go up all over the second they move. 
Saying "I sold them OTC on a major exchange" for example, has zero affect on his future sells.

of course it won't
most people don't even expect LN to succeed
