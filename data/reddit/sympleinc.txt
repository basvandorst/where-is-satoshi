Very Soon. We're in the process of helping them set it up.

Wow, I agree with thecodyshow, lots of people on here don't know anything about running a business. Remember they do have to pay for space, power, internet and any other costs associated to keep the ATM there and running. They probably make 2.5% after everything I'm guessing...If you can't spare 5% for a service you shouldn't be buying then.

The plan will be to limit buying transactions to $3000 per day, and anything over will require 2 pieces of ID and a created account within the system for records to comply with the government. The selling transactions will be limited to $1000 per day. 
I've seen this work in many of the brick &amp; mortar's currently in business today. 
We're not located in the US, so its a bit easier to get by with Bitcoin in the country.
Its been a bit hard to paint a picture for the executives to see the huge potential, because they're acting like old bankers and are having a hard time picturing Bitcoins value (mostly because it is digital and they cannot hold it).... I did have some head way with one of the directors as he see's it as something very big and could be very beneficial to the company and its image. So he's my main man to get this off the ground. 
If they do approve of the roll out (First Proof of Concept to a few stores), this will be a huge benefit to the Bitcoin community and help get Bitcoins into the hands of many more people.

We are Symple Internet Financial LTD. (Symple for short) and we'll be operating this ATM - We are a small team of 3. 
The fee will be 5%, but will be prompting specials throughout the month with lower percentage fees for specific periods on our twitter feed  along with some goodies =).

Forgot to add, one executive sent me a link to the BitInstant CEO scandal and asked me to explain why would he consider a technology that supports money laundering. I replied with a supportive answer with the properties of Bitcoin and to ignore the negatives and focus on the positives. 
As well I sent him 5 links on the HSBC money laundering for drug cartels. That pretty much ended the debate.
