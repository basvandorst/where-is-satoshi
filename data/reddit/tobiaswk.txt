That was true but recently it seems Apple has eased the testing and review process. It used to take 7-15 days to get your app through the review process. Painfully slow. Now it can take as little as one day or even same day as you submit your app for review. Personally I like this as a programmer. Sure shady apps have it easier, but I like having the ability to fix a critical bug fast.

Not at all. He is shady as hell and an outright scammer. [Wikipedia.](

Prepare for incoming flux of nutters.
I really dislike this guy. Overdramatic and has some very skewed views. Also... pumps out a lot of nonsensical bullshit. His audience eats it all.

I still have a hard time understand why people kept their coins at these guys. I mean they have basically been consistently failing right from their inception. Fail upon fail.
Why have people kept using them? It seems like a lot of people are effected by this crisis.

Never had a online wallet and never will. Been with the bitcoin for many years and stuff like this has happened countless of times now.
I'm sorry on the behalf of people who has lost coins yet again.

4-digit PIN... is this some kind of joke? Why on earth would you have a security system only utilizing a 4-digit password? Even with added security like factored authentication this still seems very unprofessional.
@_date: 2016-12-03 22:03:59
That's horrible. Nothing more to say.

First of all... this site does not represent anything official. I didn't even know the page existed until a few days ago. It is owned by some private entity.
Secondly. I do not like your design, I'm sorry. It is too pompus and has a very in "in your face" vibe about it. Look at the more [official website representing bitcoin]( Simple, clean and elegant. It cuts it straight without any baked-in fancies.

Do yourself a favour and read up about who this is and what he has done in his life. He's a real fraudster.

Thank you. Not a native English speaker.

I love it!

Can't wait for the next shitshow! It just keeps giving!
Does anyone remember "Bruce Wagner" and MyBitcoin? He just popped up in my mind tonight. Pure gold from the old days. Look it up for some late night entertainment.

I'm from Denmark and use [BitMarket.eu]( It's a bitcoin market for europeans, hence the name. They are very good, but they have a rather strict policy for new members. You need to have proof, and track record, of your business before you can be accepted as a member. I like this policy very much, it makes me trust the other members.
@_date: 2011-06-03 19:05:06
I'll do everything you do for free! Take that!
@_date: 2011-08-08 18:35:11
Well... you don't need to be online the receive funds... you can basically just have a wallet and never go online with it -- the funds will still find it's way when you go online.
@_date: 2011-08-04 15:50:31
Why would you move the coins? Just sell of the wallet itself.
@_date: 2011-08-19 21:40:10
Well... it happened in the weekend last time we had the bitcoin bubble-rise... then later epic burst.
@_date: 2011-06-02 21:34:16
It seems like there have been a lot of purchases lately.
Also the Bitcoin in EUR is 1 BTC = 9.5 EUR right now.
A week ago it was around 1 BTC = 5 EUR.
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:46:18
Around 11 coins at the moment.

The worst experience I've had a with a website in a while.
This must be a troll, or a case of trolling gone bad.

For a security person this idea sounds like one of the absolute worst ideas ever to have been conceived.
@_date: 2011-06-13 08:30:16
Yes, very good article contrary many other articles. Thank you for posting.
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:23:09
That's stupid... the bitcoin itself has nothing to do with this mess that is going on now, it's the exchanges that make the bitcoin fail.
You are as secure as you make yourself and your bitcoins. This statement could be transferred to the economic situation with the insurrance companies; we're paying for that shit now because of insane bonuses and greedy people.

I would just silent scan all drives for wallet.dat; if the virus is already on your system and you're unaware time is cheap.

Pretty much how the market works. The bitcoin will rise in value, but it will oscillate while doing it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:20:25
Just keep it simple like it is now. I'm not too fund of the "custom" css on many subs.

As transactions are validated by miners that are confirming transactions it is not really possible to determine the maximum transaction rate. It depends on many variables... but with more and more miners and clients verifying the transactions in the blockchain the faster the transaction rate will be. That is my guess. At some point it may have higher bandwith to process transactions than some big established money handlers.

I'm sorry, but this sounds incredibly stupid. Investing everything you own in one single asset is ridiculous, but also to be using borrowed money is just outright idiotic. Get some savings. When you have a fair amount in savings THEN think about some small investments.
That aside, good luck!

Someone knows someone at businessinsider. This is just a bitcoin store... we have many of those already. I don't see what the fuzz is about?

Online petitions tend to be a big joke. It is basically the laziest most ineffective approach to getting your voice heard. A bit better than just sitting in a chair at home whining on a random forum, but not by much.

This smells very bad.
