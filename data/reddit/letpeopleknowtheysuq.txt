Still holding?

How much money did you lose today?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:55:08
Maybe u lost some today. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:47:39
It won't be.

A lot of assholes on this sub need a voice of reason. See the front page of the sub to see how committed some of these greedy pigs are to quick profits and not bitcoin or crypto itself.

I'm at an Ivy league college studying biochem and CS, so yes I am smart. Suck my balls. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:16:13
Really? That's the message you take from a post criticizing fairweather buyers?

Wubba lubba dub dub.

I feel bad for you in real life man and can’t really imagine you as a social being if you’re anything like how you post. Something must really suck to have to be so condescending towards people behind the blanket of anonymity. Feel free to DM if you need someone to talk to or are going through a hard time 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:17:46
Good for you. I got in at $249.99 so I'm feeling pretty smug right now.

Past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Bitcoin isn't even the best coin. You're all being scammed. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:05:52
Nice tactic. Paint yourself as the bigger man to elicit support. Very sneaky.

What you call gatekeeping, I call prudential investing. Hold that bag, motherfucker. Hold it good. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:46:40
You invest in bitcoin with that wit? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:24:21
Got eem. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:31:03
What are you talking about? I never said speculation is a new thing. Don't lie. I've been investing for 6 years and I've generated 20% returns this year. I merely passionately hate losers that get into asset classes when those asset classes are hot and then squirm when the price falls. I hope those people lose absolutely everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:57
At least be consistent, dumb fuck. If you're going to call my 20% returns inadequate, don't question it when I state the simple fact that percentage-wise, I had a better year than Buffett. On much less money but still a better year. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:49:42
I lost zero, shitbreath. The moment I saw Tai Lopez talking about bitcoin I knew it was game over. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:48:34
Is your mom available? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:22:29
Did you read what the fuck I wrote? I'm not complaining about people making money from btc. I'm complaining about people not doing their due diligence and then acting like little pussies when invariably their "investment" fails. I have a physical revulsion to speculators who think they are investing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:11:55
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:46:15
The fuck you mean "that's all"? That's better than Warren Buffett, dipshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:25:08
Does Harvey Weinstein like raping? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:20:11
You don't know a thing about bitcoin, loser. You just repeat the same tired tropes hoping you'll get vindicated. What you don't realise is that bitcoin is to finance what the car manufacturers were to society in the 1900s. For sure useful as a whole but good luck picking the winners in a nascent industry. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:24:32


Can somebody spell bubble for me please? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:04:14
I'm trying to generate alpha by understanding the science behind biotech research. That or trying to figure out why your mom gets yeast infections so often. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:47:25
Oh JUST 50x? Totally reasonable /s
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:01:40
I'd verbally run circles around you in three languages. And yes, I've been investing since I was 15. Never said I was a prodigy but I did get into the game early.
