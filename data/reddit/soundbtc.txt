I agree.

Bitcoin is the only useful sound money we have!

Bitcoin is the only useful  'sound money'; Gold is just obsolete.

Etherum is just a bad idea; It was described as the decentralized computer; And we have today on top of Etherum exchanges, that are not really decentralized. And the other killerapp is the 'cryptokitties'. And so few users...
Etherum was just the ICO machine, an easy way to add new scams and shitcoins.
The proper way to get really decentralized exchange, is to built p2p software on top of lightning. This is not for tomorrow.

You are right, but with the one million BCASH owned by Bitmain, and now the information is public. We can likely expect a price crash in the months to come. Manipulating a market comes at a price...

If a 'better tech' existed outside Bitcoin, it can be imported back at the Bitcoin level. This is how open source projects operate. Of course, this never happened. Nothing in the Alt space add any real value. The work in the Alt space is at the premine level, or at the marketing level, outside these fields this is just worthless random software changes.

Who's care - The don't trust but verify rule applies - And the Bitcoin community is allergic to scammers.

Bitcoin is a sound money project - Alts are not.

Decentralization checklist:
1. Are you running a full validating node ? (Ethereum: you can't)
2. Did you follow the don't trust but verify rule?
3. Are you running a verified version of your full validating node following (2).
4. Are you sure your token is not premined, or was printed for free by insiders?
5. Are you sure that no marketing operation was funded by (4)?
6. Is your token follows the stock-to-flow price model?
7. ...
If you can't answer yes to one question you are centralized! Bitcoin is the only decentralized cryptocurrency!
Everything else is just marketing!

You really think that BTC went from $0 to $20000, because Bitcoin is a better database (better tech idea). Do you really think the slogan Blockchain but not Bitcojn makes any sense?
Why do you think Gold was money and not Copper?
This field is *Technology + Economics + Monetary theory.*

I'm running my own full node, and I don"t rely on amazon or the cloud to do so.
China banned Bitcoin; Bitcoin is not a company, they have no phone to call. Bitcoin is still here stronger than ever.
Bitmain tried to overtake Bitcoin. Bitcoin is stronger than ever; And Bitmain is not a relevant company anymore.
You must stop listening to marketing people. This is not a game where a random software update will improve, or change anything. Like Andreas said: 'The next Bitcoin is Bitcoin'

Bitcoin is the militarized version of the concept of Gold as money. Alts are just an attack against Bitcoin, adding 'fiat' properties to useless tokens.

You are misinterpreting the notion of Cash. Cash was defined for the Gold Standard. It defines a transaction without any counterparty risk. This is what Bitcoin does; Transactions without counterparty risk.
You must read the book: 'The Bitcoin Standard'. Bitcoin is not a magic software; Bitcoin is an ultra hard monetary asset. What Bitcoin did can't be done again.

Full node = Full decentralization + state level attack protection. Your full node will just black list and ignore someone trying to trick the protocol.
'devs...': Don't trust verify. Bitcoin is a protocol; Everybody knows what changes are OK. Everything else will be build using layers.
'The tech matters': You should really read 'The Bitcoin Standard'. Bitcoin is not a magic software code, that will be superseded with a magic 2.0 code. Bitcoin is an ultra hard monetary asset technology. Only Bitcoin will supersede Bitcoin. Economic and Monetary theory matter. Money is a winner take all game.
Bitcoin is stronger than Ethereum and anything else. Ethereum is just a collection of random software changes, done in an unscalable way. And designed to feed some marketing people. Ethereum is just a premined Altcoin where the native language of Bitcoin was replaced by javascript, and the blocksize limit was removed... But now Ethereum 2.0 will fix everything... Ethereum is just a joke!
Indeed the decentralization matters. Bitcoin is the only one where these properties are already tested (China ban...). Bitcoin is ten years old. Bitcoin will be still here for the decades to come.

The Gold Standard is over. Gold failed. Gold failed because of centralization, and the centralization happened because of the high verification cost of Gold. Running a Full node of Gold is very expense. And the Executive Order 6102 happened: Confiscation, and confiscation was possible because of the centralization.
Bitcoin fixes everything. Bitcoin doesn't have any single point of failure, and Bitcoin has a better stock-to-flow ratio than Gold. Bitcoin is just a better Gold, and it can even succeeds where Gold failed.
Gold is definitively obsolete as a monetary system in the digital world.
