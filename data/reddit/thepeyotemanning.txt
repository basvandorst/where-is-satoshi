How on Earth do you think this is "news"? This is an internet forum about crypto currency. That show is about tech nerds.  Do you expect nerds to not discuss nerdy things with other nerds on internet forums? Especially when it's on a major TV show? Wtf are you expecting?

So sell, if you really believe the negativity, it's not FUD or anything, if you truly don't believe in the projects you invested in and you honestly don't believe that they'll rise to a higher value then the only reasonable thing to do is sell.
Don't listen to random people on the internet. I'm a random person on the internet. I think it's absolutely absurd to sell right now. I'd say it's even outright stupid but if that's really how you feel then follow your gut. I'll buy up your shares.

I love the typo in the article along with a price prediction without any sort of reasoning to back it up at all. Seems legit.

Or clever Reddit posts. Yeah that'll do it!

As a merchant or as a customer?

Ver? Yeah, that dude has the charisma of a porcupine with a rusty saw in it's anus singinging karaoke on amphetamines.

Also, if you think the difference between bull and bear markets is aggressiveness then you most certainly shouldn't be teaching anyone anything about anything probably.

"Charts don't work" might be the single most hilariously stupid thing posted today on all of the interwebs.
Air don't work.
Gravity don't work.
Round Earth don't work.
