Also been waiting for over a month now. Hopefully they will resolve this in time but I dont see that happening.

Please document your situation and if you are willing to share it with me, I would be very grateful.

Opened it from their support site each time.

Sure thing. I guess I have been an investor for about 15 years now and have traded money in the usual forms. Be that through currency exchanges on the FOREX or via plain old stocks and mutual funds. Bitcoin mania looked interesting so I thought I would give it a go with a decently large amount of money but nothing too extreme. I put it on Quadriga and made a few trades and decided it was not for me. I then tried to withdraw my funds from Quadriga. 
That is where you get blocked. I have all my details on the site set up correctly and am a software engineer so I know my way around a website. I tried to send the money to my account in several ways over the course of weeks and it seemed fine. I got worried when the money never arrived. I then turned on Email 2FA from their site and it was set up properly. Then they stopped sending me emails. No password reset, nothing. 
I filed about 50 tickets with them explaining the situation and a robot closed most of them automatically. I did reach a "real person" twice via email and they did not look into the situation at all. They simply said "Email 2FA is not associated with that account" They then just close my tickets. Over and over. 
I have no way to access my funds or even log in. This is the same story for many others if you search the internet. 
I am sure there are some that have withdrawn funds successfully but if you are on Quadriga and have never tired to get your money back at all, you are playing a HUGE risk. Verify that you can unless you want your money to be gone.
I am sure my account has some technical issue that they can resolve. However, there is no support there. No phone number no directory of employees. Nothing to get in touch with them. 
I believe them to be corrupt. Banks hold money form deceased and abandoned accounts all the time. That money gets absorbed by the bank. It is in Quadriga's best interest to not support clients in trouble since they absorb the funds.

Great idea. Will do.

I can see why you would say 50 is a lot. I have given extreme detail. I keep opening new tickets since they keep closing them. I get the same message many times and it is the exact same text. I feel like they have a bot that is trying to reduce support needs. I have only been given unique answers from a human twice and they dismissed my concerns.
