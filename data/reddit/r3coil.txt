It's a cool story but according to historians there's a major lack of evidence that "Tulip Mania" actually happened. Within that industry there was certainly a spike and then a drop in the price, but you didn't have every person and their dog buying in to it.

You have way more than the average person if you're keeping 'a couple of coins just in case'.

Timing the market seems easy in hindsight but in practice it's very difficult. You will lose money trying to do this. Better for 99% of people to buy the dips and hold.

People just don't fucking take the time to try and understand this shit. The older generation is the worst for this. Bitcoin is not simply a security (like a stock). They expect the whole thing to unravel because people are going to sell at the top of the **"**bubble**"** and cause a crash. 
If this shit is successful - which it will be - then one day we wont have to convert to fiat. That's what they don't get.

When did I say I was blind to the risks or that this wasn't a bubble? All I said is that tulip mania wasn't real.

Wow, ignore that jerk. It's important to ask these questions and this is a big one in understanding the end game. I'd rather see stuff like this on here than "I'm out gu- LOL JUST KIDDING".

The unconfirmed transaction shows up immediately for me (as it should).

It's a fake story.

Ignore that other comment. 
No, as a Canadian you can't sell your bitcoin for FIAT on Coinbase. You will need to transfer it.
See for options. I recommend QuadrigaCX. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:44:22
Don't sell your current coins, but yes this is a dip, and traditionally it has worked out for people when they buy the dips.
Just ask yourself: will bitcoin ever hit 17K again? If you think it will then buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:36:56
Monero (XMR) is a good one.

Not necessarily *any* wallet, but one that uses the same protocol for creating the seed.

The link you are replying to literally says that it was exaggerated.

The author has no idea what he is talking about. 
He tries to talk about how the scarcity argument doesn't apply by referencing forks. Forks are not Bitcoin. There is still a finite number. 
The price to transaction fee ratio comparison is just the cherry on top. Would you feel better about owning Bitcoin if sending $100 in Bitcoin cost $10? IT'S A **CURRENCY**, not a stock. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:30:24
It seems to be that they are aiming to create a cryptocurrency that world banks will use as the default medium in place of the US dollar which is currently used.  
This has always been a great use case for Bitcoin.

Good blog. A lot of the ideas are also in The Bitcoin Standard (book) so if you've read that it's going to feel like a review for the most part.

It's not acceptable in any way. However he can be a child rapist and still have correct ideas in his field of choice. Attack the ideas, not the person.
He tries to make this relevant by saying Keynes was focused on short term pleasure in his personal life, but it's weak at best.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:27:46
Thanks for the honesty.

I, too, have read The Bitcoin Standard.

It's still around, the last I checked.

What makes you say it won't be possible to bail them out this time?
@_date: 2019-08-30 04:32:07
The first section of the book is good where he details the history of money over time.
The last half of the book is good when bitcoin is discussed.
But the piece in the middle where he starts ranting about modern art and makes ad hominem arguments against Keynes hurt his cause imo.
Still worth reading but I wish he had dialed back those pieces.
@_date: 2019-08-17 16:55:42
This is true. There is no way to reverse a transaction. 
I would imagine that by doing your research you will find websites that have been around, are well reviewed, and are not looking to scam people over (what I imagine is) $100 or less. That wont last long.

1) Store your keys properly and this isn't possible. 
2) Don't hold your life savings in Bitcoin.

They say you are 'in control of [your] wallet at all times' but do you have the private key?

Sure, this isn't too uncommon. But they are likely accepting it through a payment processor which immediately converts it to fiat at the current rate. The currency is too volatile for your average business to accept and hold it.

This is correct.

I don't understand how this is unsettling. All you've described is the value of bitcoin increasing. If bitcoin increases in value then the smaller units are worth more too.
The fact it's divisible like this is a good thing. No matter how much it increases in value it can still be used for smaller payments.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:14:51
You can have it both ways.
Services will exist that manage coins for people. But you can always roll your too.

You go all in when you know you have the best hand at the table. Preflop this is AA. With cards showing its entirely dependent on the hand you have made and all possible hands out there.
