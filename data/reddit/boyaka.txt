Not reading the wall, but directly answering the quest:
Visa and PayPal have a lot of rules about who you can pay. Bitcoin has zero.
Also, merchants are charged fees to be able to use Visa/PayPal. These fees are most likely adjusted to create profits for those companies. I don't want to support the inefficient fiat bookkeeping. It's just not honest.

I'm with them in that I don't understand what's going on right now, but I also already understood what you are saying (I get the idea of having majority power over the pool)
What I don't understand is the actual mining and mining pool environment, as I have never mined a virtual currency. Why are people all suddenly being drawn to one pool? I get the sense that this has been a trend. Is it emerging just because it's getting close to 50%, like when Gangnam style was getting close to 1 billion views? Is somebody behind the scenes herding sheep? How does P2Pools solve this issue?

Yeah, I guess that's where a lot of modern restaurants have been moving. This is the type of thing that can be solved regardless of the currency used I guess.

Yeah, I've heard of databases that manage accounts of people sharing bills before mobile devices (going on trips with other interns in 2007). I was mainly just thinking about the inefficiency on the merchant side of things in regards to laying it on the customer to figure out how to pay a single bill with several people.
In the end it gets back to the whole argument about what bitcoin provides that is actually important. Issues related to this one such as transaction fees and printing/signing of several receipts can actually potentially be solved while still using fiat money. These are just things the financial industry hasn't bothered making better because they are on top. It seems like regardless of whether bitcoin succeeds or not, hopefully it will at least put these industries in their place and force them to solve (and cease profiting off of) these inefficiencies too.

Welcome to speculation of commodity/currency values. There have been a lot more winners/losers in our fiat pumped system. Why do you think 1% of the population controls the majority of it?

Currently there are something like 13 million bitcoin, and already 56 million of these. Purchasing 1490 is therefore somewhat like currently owning 1490/(56/13) = 1490/4.3 = like having 350 bitcoin today. It seems like a lot but obviously that 56 million is going to grow fast. Obviously it would need to grow about 350 times for you to have what would feel like 1 bitcoin in today's market (which will only ever be 21 million max). 56 million * 350 = 1.96 x 10^10 = 19.6 x 10^9 = 19.6 trillion ether. All of this is not considering the perceived value (currently about 1 btc = 500 usd), which will obviously be less for ether. Currently 350 times less would be 500 (usd/btc) / 350 (ether/btc) = 1.4 usd per ether (putting you at 1490 * 1.4 2100 or so usd!), but obviously that is going to be lower due to lower perceived value (less influential people owning it, lower amount of fiat/btc invested in it) and the number of existing ether going a lot higher than it's current 56 million. You would break even if the amount of ether stayed at 56 million (no) and the perceived value ended up being 1.4 usd/ether (1.4usd/eth/500usd/btc = eth is 0.28% of the value of btc), OR if the number of existing ether went to 19.6 trillion and ended up being 100% of the bitcoin usd market. An investor would hope that the number of existing ether doesn't reach 19.6 trillion (unless you really think this is going to get as much USD pumped into it as bitcoin), but also hope that the perceived value could be at least 0.28% of btc or more. Hopefully it will end up being somewhere in between.
Example: If there ended up being 1 trillion ether and the value of fiat invested in ether ended up being say, 10% of the amount invested in bitcoin (would feel like 50 usd/bitcoin), and the number of existing bitcoins is as much as there is today, ether would end up being worth (13 million btc / 1 trillion ether) * 50 usd/btc = 0.013 btc/ether * 50 usd/btc = 0.65 usd/ether, leaving you with 970 USD. You could also say if they kept giving them out at 1490 ether per bitcoin it would require [ (1 trillion - 56 million) total ether / 1490 ether/btc ] * 500 usd/btc = (944 million total ether / 1490 ether/btc) * 500 usd/btc = ~634k btc * 500usd/btc = 316 million in current value usd pumped into it. And that 1490 is going down, so a lot more than that 316 million is going to be required. 10% of bitcoin's market is the 13 million existing * 500 usd so 6.5 trillion, 10% of which is 650 million which I predicted it would be worth in this case. Clearly 1 trillion is looking like too high of a quantity for ether
How many ether will end up existing? How much fiat will be put into it compared to what is in bitcoin currently? I haven't read too much about how this crypto works, but it would be interesting to see a chart comparing the predicted quantities of ether to the predicted fiat/eth values.

Was having lunch with some coworkers today, and when that dreaded moment of splitting the bill came I thought about how much easier it could be if we didn't have to deal with the restaurant processing all of these payment receipts.
One of my coworkers asked me a rhetorical question regarding what bitcoin could do that google wallet couldn't. I explained that even with google wallet, it would still be a hassle for the merchant to deal with processing all the individual payments. I didn't go into the ideology of not having a central authority charging fees, and having a network not managed by anybody that imposes no limitation on transfers between each other, but you all know about all of this...
However, I was curious about what capabilities Google wallet could have. If you think about it, Google has the infrastructure to run just about anything it wants. It could easily and securely run a financial system. Out of curiosity I decided to search about this topic, and turned up with this link. Kind of trippy that they had thought of that well ahead of me. What are they plotting over at Google in regards to bitcoin?

Hot dogs arent a very good determination of value. They are just about as overpriced as soda.

Not sure if you guys are trolling, but it is definitely Japanese pronunciation, so do ど (sounds like doh), and ge げ (sounds like geh), ドゲコイン.
By the way, Japanese say "inu" いぬ、犬 for dog, rather than using the English word. If they did, I would think they would say something like ドギー dogii, or ドーグ do-gu. I dunno. Doge seems like some weeaboo made it up.
Edit: Actually confirmed on alc that it would be ドッグ doggu, not ドーグ [1]. Also found a reference to ドギー　in relation to doggy bag [2].
[1] ドッグ◆単純な機械的保持具で、スパイクやフックなどに使用される。
[2] 〔レストランの〕ドギー・バッグ、持ち帰り用の袋◆残り物を自分が食べるのに「愛犬のために」と遠回しに言う客側の表現

Well, for one the meme is a Japanese dog. Two, the entire joke of the meme is that you say things without proper grammar like a Japanese person. Three, I think whoever came up with this meme (I'll have to take a look at encyclopedia dramatica or something) probably thought that that is the way a Japanese person would sound when they say "Dog". That one is more of an opinion.

I made a purchase on the 5th. I want to buy more but it says I need to wait for that one to go through. I attempted the verification process and answered the questions about places I've lived and stuff, and it failed. This was yesterday at around 7pm. I guess I'll have to wait til 7pm today and try verifying again and continue to wait for the first purchase to go through...
This is Coinbase. I also have a Mt Gox account, but I keep hearing that it's a bad idea to send USD there.

My bad. I actually remember seeing that Homestarrunner episode, but didn't make the association. Looks like the meme is kind of a convergence between the tumblr shibe's and the homestarrunner doge usage.

Well, the task thing is just an additional idea to help people join in on the global currency who dont have money. It's the same way the US government pays citizens to pick up cans. I don't know how this could be implemented in the program to be added in somehow, like as a module, later on after the establishment of the currency. ~~Maybe require majority vote of everybody to decide to add a module that could generate coins.~~ Err that's a bad idea, because we can't determine individual people in a system like bitcoin... In general this idea kinda spawned from thinking about human based currencies: ones where funds are provided based on being a person. I guess that sounds kind of communist too though, haha.

It's interesting, if you actually look at the maximum number of bitcoins, take off a good chunk of it to account for lost bitcoins, multiply by 1 million to get microBTC, it is about the national debt. At national debt parity a Satoshi would be equivalent to a Penny.
This would also mean $1 million USD/BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:43:34
I searched for this recently and found bitcoins minted that have a value of a single btc. Of course that will mean it isn't a typical dollar coin xD should probably be made to be worth a micro or a satoshi. Maybe a milli if you think we are stabilizing in value (I think it will be either back to 1 BTC per USD if it fails and way way higher than now if it succeeds. At least if it succeeds we all know we will be going to satoshis to handle the economic load, maybe even smaller.
I have also seen a physical bitcoin that had a wallet I'd engraved on it and was tied to an account with 1 btc. I remember seeing the account change in value shortly after the news was shared.

Still. How do I figure out how much that is? I don't normally gamble, so I don't normally think about this....I've lost $400ish on pachinko in Japan. I was a student though and didn't care as long as I had some money. I've lost $400 at a strip club before, and that felt horrible. It was my first time and I didn't know what was going on. Somehow I have managed my way through brief periods of unemployment and excessive amounts of spending on things I don't really need (mostly due to help from my parents) but in my current, pretty independent position, I'm just having a rough time figuring out what I can live without. The future is blurry, too...

For me it was 2 days to register and buy, but the purchase has taken another 2 days to complete so far. I'm pretty happy with it, but I just wish I could buy again, and I'm confused why my verification didn't complete properly.

I also got this email about the OTP system on Thanksgiving, it's also about Bitcoin Black Friday. I've never gotten an email from them, signed up back in the boom from 30~300~70~100 in April, but I never had money to invest. Started my Job in September, wish I thought about bitcoin but I've been too busy!

They make two small charges on your bank account to verify it (between $0.01 and $0.99), you have to confirm the numbers they charge so they can make sure it's your account. The charges are over $1 for verifying credit cards. Not a big deal, really. Gas stations have done this to me often, but I guess they do normally return the funds.

Lol. I based this idea off of questions I remember him answering about how we can end the federal reserve, which basically ends the USD. The gist of it is that it is going to be very hard times, and the longer we wait the harder it is going to be. We need to do what we can to support people already invested and dependent on the services provided by the government that depend on that money. Of course this involves the typical ron paul shpeel: saving money by bringing our troops home so we don't have to completely cut those people off. Ron paul wants us to use gold as a currency, but he also understands that we can't just jump right into doing that. Stopping the runaway inflation caused by the federal reserve in its tracks is the answer to begin the transition, and transferring the entire supply of USD to a bitcoin-like infrastructure is this solution I am proposing.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:58:17
The only way it would be tied to a central party is on the initial day of establishment, where it is tied to the USD. This is how we live our lives today anyways, and it's pretty fair in general. The key to making it more fair is transferring it to a system that doesn't involve banking. Yes, this currency involves banking too, but only on a single day and everybody can exchange exactly as much USD as they want. Of course this coin would have to tie into the current exchange rates for USD. Maybe to protect against inflation we could use the exchange rates from 10 or 20 years ago? 50 years ago? The whole idea is to base this on a global currency though, so it would probably have to be some time after the WMF was founded I guess.
