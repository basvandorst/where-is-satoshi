Yes. Don't have to get along. But name calling, bashing people instead of ideas, etc. This sub is acting like 7year olds and no, the other side is not better....
But hey, that is where we are. Both sides are doing it so it's not only me right.... 
Man up and be a fucking human being.

100 blocks is a few hours only. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:38:34
You are smarter than most :)

I think we differ in that I don't care the principles of immutability was violated, it's not a big deal for me. They did what I wanted, so good.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:58:31
Sure why not. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:58:00
Not true. The community agreed to not give in to the Thief (our version of the Mt gox / bitfinex hack).
Sure you could say code is law, and that is why we have 2 versions of ethereum, everyone are free to choose.

Well it's an exchange, so buyer have to meet seller :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:12:47
I'm saying community consensus was there, and the rest doesn't matter. If everyone (almost) agree, there is no conflict of interest.
We went together, developers and users and miners against the theif.
Do you see my point of view?
We all wanted this, and made it happen. There was no conflict. Even if the ethereum developers was invested n the dao, we were all in the same boat.
BUT, if you don't agree with my statement that almost everyone was agreeing to the fork then my other statements are void.

You are right, and most were fine with it but no hard feelings for people who felt it was crossing a line, ETC still exists and is doing good. 
Regarding blockchain size, it's a drawback of decentralisation, but at the same size HDD price per GB is going down.

I don't know. The community was at this time still small, like ETH was 200mUSD only. So reaching a consensus regarding stopping a thief was possible. I doubt it would be possible today. Maybe. 
It's like agreeing on a movie if you are 3 persons vs 300 :-)
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:59:55
It's hard to prove one way or another, but if you choose to believe me: consensus WAS reached and this was what the community at that time wanted. 
With consensus I mean &gt;80%.
You may select to not believe me.

Majority of the users also supports the fork. Check @_date: 2017-05-30 18:11:28
The EEA including the largest companies in the world (feel free to check the link) think otherwise.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:10:08
I'm happy they got me my ETH back that was stolen. I'm sure everyone is looking after their own interests.
So everyone can select the chain. It's a free world :-)
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:17:31
It's ok. Ethereum is not for all. Options are good. Still like Bitcoin also.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:29:44
It wasn't factually measured. But looking at how many are outspoken today or even right after the fork, I would say majority wanted that outcome.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:59:01
For one thing it proves ethereum is on the right track and that smart contracts are something wanted.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:01:18
It's like saying goodbye Bitcoin because ethereum have lightning on their testnet.
It's not one or the other, there will exist hundreds of cryptocoins.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:36:55
Okcoin just announced they will enable Ethereum trading in 2 days.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:52:31
Yeah but you pay a premium right? For Eth it was like 10% higher 1 month ago
@_date: 2017-06-24 05:09:20
Imagine the 8000 that bought in the ETH presale for 30 cents.
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:35:40
No. Because you could get 1000 Eth ath 30 cents. How much volume was sold at 10 cents?
