So as I see it 
- Gold is valuable because it can be used in computing, looks pretty, etc
- USD, GBP, etc are valuable because lots of companies have borrowed it and promise to pay it back later. They back this promise with capital equipment, factories, people, supply chains, etc
- Stocks are valuable because they give a future cashflow of dividends at the companies discretion
- Bonds are valuable because they give a future cashflow of 
interest payments, enforced by company law. 
What value does Bitcoin have? Intrinsically, it has the value that you can update the blockchain with bytes. But this value floats widely.

I'm really confused. So you think that it's fine/irrelevant that bitcoin isn't really used rather it's desirable as a speculative tool? And you knowingly make this argument and own bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:52:52
Aye but this all assumes that bitcoin have value in the first place. It can have all the properties, but it needs value in the first place to be able to transfer value in a consensus-based, censorship resistance, non-confiscatable way. 
If you assume it has this value by people being willing to exchange for goods and services, then its value is now dependent on these people. Worse, these people have no obiligation to exchange fixed amount and indeed they don't. For example, a IT retailer exchanges a computer at a x$ worth of bitcoin, not y amount of bitcoin. And that $ value changes quite rapidly as we've seen.

Are you retarded? Do you honestly think crypto could go down? Filthy nocoiner - no understanding of technological. It's literally mathematically impossible for bitcoin to be a bubble. TO THE MOOOON. LAMMMBOOOOO.

So lemme get this straight. Most of you are fine that bitcoin is not a currency. It's value is that you can speculate on it, and it will go up in value forever, because other people think this?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:07:35
So bitcoins utility is that it will keep going up in value making people who own it richer?

In what way does 'holding it' constitute using it?
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:48:22
It's very similar to a bank run where you have two nash equlilibriums, a bad one and a good one.

Bitcoin hasn't improved in almost a decade (it's actually more expensive to transact and there are less retailers offering it). VISA has only improved. What's different now?

Fiat currencies are debts so they are backed. Companies and governments have promised to pay back the currency by exchanging goods in the future for them. The way modern currency works is:
company thinks it can make goods in the future -&gt; borrows from bank -&gt; company gives bank deposits to workers -&gt; deposits go back to company when the workers buy the goods back. 
Modern currency is debt based - so it's supply increases with the supply of current and (expected) future.

? Penecillin, refrigeration, crop rotation, central heating, fertilization had far more impact on human standards of living than the internet (which actually has had very little impact on human standards of living which is improving much more slowly than it did at the start of the 20th century).

But this is in an incredibly fragile equilibrium. If people keep buying because they expect the price to go up, they can also keep selling because they expect the price to go down. You just need one thing to start the cycle. For example, this is what happen with the market for rare beanie babies. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:57:08
So you think the value of Bitcoin is as a rational bubble? It has value not because people think Bitcoin itself is valuable but they think other people will think it's valuable - sort of like the Keynesian beauty contest? I think basing something's value on psychology in this manner isn't particularly stable. 
Fiat currencies have stable inflation and interest rates which allows people to make decisions in the future more easily since we know the prices in the future. 
But that's fine since for you the value of bitcoin is as an investment in a rational bubble? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:56:26
Aye but you can sell them on for now. The oppotunity cost of actual money is what burns.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:05:27
How do you know people will just continuing to keep buying it? No one knows that. Already in the last few months we've had incredible volatility. Do you really believe this or are you trolling me?

DUUUMMMMBBBBB. Free market stop everything with loans. FREEE MARRRKKKEEETTT.

Austrian isn't really a school of economics - it's mostly conspiracy theorists. 
So companies borrow off the back off being able to produce things in the future. The market then in theory evaluates these claims. So it's the expectation of these companies delivering the goods which is valuable, since the goods don't presently exist. 
Of course, the market could be wrong and expect goods which won't actually be produced (or not enough will be). In this case, there will be lots of defaults and the supply of money will shrink. 
But really, most of the wealth of a society is going to be in promises to produce future goods, since the goods and services available right now is very small compared to all the goods and services that will be produced.
