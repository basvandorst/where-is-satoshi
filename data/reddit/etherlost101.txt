I hate that term correction. Not hating on you. Its just such a bad euphemism for price drop. It implies markets are incorrect. Which they aren’t. And if it can “correct” down, it can also “correct” up.

I think we agree more than disagree. I guess my point is I don't think there's much we can do about it. So trying to fight it in a legal framework is a waste of time, we should fight it in other ways. The first thing that comes to mind is education/marketing.

I think you’re confusing capitalism with what we have today which is really corporatism. Where big business gets in bed with the government to get protections that allow the 1% to have what I consider unfair advantages and protections.

I dont mind the post so much. But I don’t think its wise to ask for a loan immediately after claiming to have more than enough bitcoins to fund it yourself. Have you ever watched an episode of Shark Tank?
Why should someone else be willing to part with their money and take a risk on you, if you don’t believe in yourself enough to put in what you have? 
I even like he business idea but there’s no way someone is going to put up cash, for such a small return on an unproven business. And you could not have said anything worse than “I have more than enough bitcoin”

@_date: 2018-01-08 06:25:28
I wish I knew more about multisig, but basically you can split keys in more than one part requiring a certain number of them to send bitcoin. By default, greenaddress says they generate 3 keys, 2 of which are required for a transaction. They hold one on their servers, one is on your device in the app, snd another they state is in an offline backup. Bitaddress did not spell out the location of the 3rd key in plain English so I wasn’t comfortable. There was something about a 90 day auto release in the event that Bitaddress shuts down and an alternate option to enable a wallet that you do have complete control over in the App. However, it was non standard or used multisig and none of this made me comfortable given the old addage “if you don’t control the keys, you don’t own the coins”. I also experienced a few errors with a popup and some raw code within the App when I went to create an address. I can’t be comfortable with a product like that.

Alternatively you could transfer the coins to a temp address that supports a recovery phrase, then transfer Bitcoin back to a separate cold wallet to secure it and zero out the Bitcoin balance, then “recover” the zeroed out temp address on BTC.com to get your Bitcoin cash. Don’t leave anything on BTC.com and don’t make any mistakes!

You’re saying there needs to be an overarching FORCE, that adds more money into the system otherwise people would be too stupid to trade for things they want and need?

Why do we need to “control” it. The reason we have unemployment is because of the manipulation of the monetary system in the first place. “Control” over the employment market is a myth that only serves to spread the problems around until it pops.

Then they deserve to fail. What are you going to do? Force them to change their views? That doesn't sound like it fits with your theme of: "difference of opinion, which leads to success. If everybody in a particular space comes from a similar background with similar opinions on everything, there’s no real substantive debate." They have a different opinion.

Why would it not be equal to the general population? Unless there is some reason to suggest overlap between atheists and bitcoin users other than “athiests are logical” then your hypothesis is biased. I find atheism highly illogical. At least agnostics dont feel sure. It takes a great deal of “faith” to be so sure God doesn’t exist when there is evidence all around that He does.
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:11:45

Cloud mining companies start out with good intentions but because there is zero transparency I think it’s hard for them to resist taking money for things they cannot deliver on. Never seen a cloud mining company work out. Just buy from local bitcoins or coinbase

Dont agree but love the expression lol
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:57:05
You’re making serious serious assumptions. And the reason these things are so heinous is because they are “illegal.” If we actually lived in a free society, many of these activities wouldn’t exist and the ones that did would be far safer. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:35:14

Yes. Thats how free markets work. They are your kids, and its your job to protect them. Not the governments. 
As soon as word spreads that you sell cars with malfunctioning airbags, how many people will buy from you? You’ll go out of business. It would be seriously against your self interest to sell cars with faulty airbags. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:47:38
Yes yes. Im well aware that everything is a crime these days. What would we do without the giant government to protect us? - I mean - exact revenge when someone does something we don’t like?
Just because you think there was obvious intent doesn’t mean there was. There are plenty of alternative explanations, many of which are posted on this thread.

The point is that inflation is inherent to fiat currency.

Yeah if you’re not measuring relative to anything. Was milk less in dollars 40 years ago? The purchasing power of the dollar has decreased. If the rate of growth on your index funds isn’t outpacing inflation, you aren’t making money
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:15:49
Yup. They locked up my buddy’s alt coin (a very small amount) after he paid them 0.5 btc to mine it. Told him not to in the first place but I guess I shouldn’t be shocked that after paying in what is now worth 4k, they won’t release $100 to him. Total scam. Stay far away.

Or you know, private markets could audit and inspect distributors to make sure things are safe. Which would be far more effective than reactive “laws”
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:15:06
Not understanding your point. Private Blockchains are pointless without a reward/incentive mechanism 
@_date: 2018-08-13 05:30:23
Sure that makes sense. But thats not because of skin color. There are plenty of other factors
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:48:58
No thats the opposite of what Im talking about. Free markets would have increased accountability and many audits from private organizations.

You cant even manage all the altcoins it supports on it at once - and we are talking only a handful im really disappointed with it. Way clunkier than expected 
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:51:06
What about altcoins stored on it? How does the backup work with those?
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:20:04
That sounds even scarier... 
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:41:16

If you’re learning from a “modern” Econ101 class they are almost certainly teaching you exclusively Keynesian economics under the guise of this is the only true way things can work. Debt based economies ALWAYS fail eventually. Look into Austrian economics. For your own good. Please.

Thats fine and you’re entitled to your opinion. But youre not entitled to my money and neither is the government. You can call people delusional but I don’t need to use insults to explain that the idea that there wouldn’t be roads and running water without a group of extortionists stealing my money and building it for me “because they know best” just is not correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:34:39
Electricity doesn’t work like the internet and its naive to think that a government keeps anything free and open. Governments exist to do the exact opposite.

I didn’t mean to be harsh, it sounds like you’re a bit new into bitcoin. Its still pretty much the Wild West. And that was kind of the point.  There aren’t too many laws especially regarding intellectual property and trademark. No one owns the name.

What does that have to do with anything? The government is completely corrupt. They'll screw anyone for anything. I'm not a Ver fan but I'm even less of a fan of monopolies. Check out a book Thee Felonies a Day

Im just seeing this now and I very much appreciate the reply! You're the only paper wallet I use! Even so, and you sound very trustworthy, since Im not a coder myself I have to trust that 10 years from now, my coins will still be at the address I sent them too, and that the private key definitely corresponds to the public one. Your transparency here and discussion goes a long way though. Thank you!

Government only exists because of force. If there was not force, it would not exist. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 23:01:00
Wrong. People should pay for what they use. I'm also very in favor of charity. But taking MY money to allocate it where YOU see fit is theft. The solution to being in need is not a government. Government creates many more problems than it solves. If you think government is some benevolent friendly organization that just exists to help people you are way way off the mark.

He should be able to change the store he's accessing. I've never done it and don't know which mobile os you're on so I have no knowledge of Android. But here's how to do it via Apple App Store: maybe this will work to allow him to update the App if he's using iOS. I've also never used circle, but I'm assuming once he updates the App his Circle credentials will let him in.
@_date: 2017-04-08 20:25:31
I'm not trying to annoy you. I'm just trying to continue to learn about this. How can I be sure that you don't have some code in there that makes public keys that attach to private keys that only you have control over (after all I can't verify this without actually testing the private key on the internet) Or that you don't have code that says ever 1000th address, make that one correspond to your private key. Or have the generation seeded in some way where you can know what the keys are even though they are generated offline. 
Again, I'm trusting you here. But is there any way beyond reading the code myself to know that none of these are the case?
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:18:57

I mean I like what you’re doing but the approach is a little... rough
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:08:13
Governments think they make rights. That makes them wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:27:02
You lose arguments when you say “he was arrested” like that lessens his credibility. I dont support Ver but thats a low blow

@_date: 2018-02-03 09:46:41
Yeah no its not. I don’t own things just because the government says I do.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:12:48
Government regulations ruin free markets
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:45:54
I need examples because I don’t buy it. If working hours were “fair”, a market would determine that on its own, not a legislator. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:11:32
Thank you. Wow. You clearly have a great understanding of this. Thanks for he detailed explanation!
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:10:40
And what have you done to help the poor?
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:38:25
Nah not really. I think that might be your attitude. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:18:26
Youll be ok. Money isn’t everything. Believe me, I feel for your loss and wish it didn’t happen to you. But try to focus on positive things in your life that you do have. Including your health, people around you, and more. God bless.

I cant answer your whole question because I don’t understand the second half. But no bitcoin cash is a fork of bitcoin. Its a separate coin and not replacing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:22:45
Seriously? Where do you think governments get money to “invest” (aka redistribute)?
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:33:44
This guy seems like a nice man
@_date: 2017-10-03 05:55:26
I think there is a place for altcoins but I think your question has the answers in itself. Bitcoin has the most use, most traction, widest adoption and more. It has more value than altcoins. So therefore the price increases and as people find altcoins less valuable, their price decreases. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:16:45
Capitalism always brings prices down and increases quality. Always. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:47:13

I don’t understand your Catholic comment. What did you mean by that? :) thanks
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:38:05
You want to use a wallet that does not have access to your private keys, like Trezor or Ledger or Bitcoin paper wallets are good. You do not want to keep your Bitcoin on an exchange for example because they hold the private key. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:48:23
No they dont. Free means without restriction. Humans restricting things do not make them fair. Regulations create bubbles and not just in financial markets that eventually pop and cause plenty of destruction. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:50:29
How does this even work?

Send your BTC to a new address FIRST, then use the OLD address for BCH: sweep using coinomi or restore with your seed using BTC.com. I don’t recommend Coinomi for anything other than this and I wouldn’t keep things on BTC.com either but this process was successful for me on both with 2 separate addresses. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:45:29
Thats not how bitcoin works. Thats not how life works 
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:02:11
I get how youre saying that the ability to change things still exists. But theres a spectrum. And bitcoin is much harder to change because it is distributed and decentralized so much more than the concentration of power with fiat

This is really misinformed and really bad advice. You’re making a lot of assumptions, all of which have proven repeatedly to cause people in crypto to lose money. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:56:15
This is incredibly brilliant. Such wisdom. Where have all the true thinkers like this guy gone?

Not sure that does much unless its a lot of hashing power.

What are you talking about? “Free” money has no value. All a basic income does is make everything more expensive. It’s complete manipulation of numbers that will eventually end very badly. I think some Austrian economics info would help you.

Who in their right mond would voluntarily hand over crypto to people who want to be part of the government?

How is it worse? I agree it’s just as bad but what do you mean by this?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:23:02
The point is these hard forks effectively create different coins when it splits off

Haha humans throwing other humans in cages is disgusting. Im far from a moral relativist but electing people to rule over others and force them to bow to their wishes is wrong. Laws protect exactly zero people. Society doesn’t need laws. It needs free markets. It appears you misunderstand bitcoin.

Why do people get into bitcoin, a stateless currency, and then whine to the state when they make a mistake? I don’t like what Ver is doing either, but bitcoin is meaningless if the government gets to come play “mommy” anytime something goes wrong.

Well you are supposed to legally pay taxes on gains you make. It sounds like you just want to invest in bitcoin and make a return on your investment. Those exchanges I listed would be fine for that. Though I don't endorse any particular one. Just make sure whenever you cash out, you report your gains and pay capital taxes on it so you dont get in tax trouble. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:16:39
But will they hard fork on a whim?
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:48:19
You should stop doing drugs and invest your money wisely. You'll be a lot better off

I was all in on Ethereum until that hardfork by fiat
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:11:35
It should be fine. The person who sent it likely did so with low transaction fees which means it will take some time to confirm. Do you have the transaction ID? As long as its going to an address you control it will get there eventually. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:30:08
If youre new and aren't worried about privacy, just using it as an investment vehicle, you can buy from Coinbase or Gemini. I've heard Gemini is quicker but asks for more personal info. You'll want to learn about hardware wallets like Ledger for keeping your Bitcoin safe
@_date: 2017-05-02 08:58:36
No. There exists good and evil. Truth and lies. Taxes are external. Drugs are a choice and then destroy from within. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:39:06

@_date: 2017-05-23 07:56:34
"Instead of sitting and bicker about "code is law" due to a malicious attack, stagnating the network for years." 
No one ever proved how the network would stagnate for years because of this. It was a feel good bail out, the opposite of crypto is all about.
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:05:15
Security - Privacy - Convenience
Picture those 3 at oppsite points on a triangle. (if someone could like to the article where I saw that in regards to bitcoin that would be great)
It's difficult to place a point in that triangle that sufficiently meets all those requirements. Bitcoin is still currently in its early stages. These difficulties will be worked out over time, like the progression of the internet. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:40:23
Because bitcoin has the most support and the network has the most hash power. Bitcoin started it all.

@_date: 2017-05-14 23:06:40

The above is good advice. A lawyer will help you. If you're honest about the bitcoin and sure you have it, maybe letting him know you will pay him a significant percentage upon recovery would interest them in helping you even more

Youre going to get a lot of down votes for this, not from me, but others will downvote because there are many resources online already. See the stickies and check out bitcoin.org

Can't recommend Coinbase to anyone after something like this. Absolutely terrible

Arent they delayed until September? I keep waiting but they never catch up in production...

My point is development effort is far more complicated with NFC than a QR code which I think will complicate/stifle development

Youre describing ETC. ETH does not have all those properties

Then how do you explain Ross Ulbricht?

Capitalism absolutely destroys, and ruins cheaters. You’re thinking of corporatism, which is alive and well, where the government monopoly protects large companies from punishment for doing a lot of wrong

A coinbase rep responded to the thread saying they were working on the case. It looked pretty legit 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:57:33
Source? Im not a fan of the guy but can you explain what you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:03:00
Well said. Agree completely

Yes. These trades occur relative between btc and the altcoin and then the dollar value against bitcoin. So youre looking for increases across both. 
Your example is kind of unusual because other coins can be measured in dollar value see coinmarketcap.com, but that is calculated by the value it trades at against bitcoin and then converting the bitcoin valie to dollars. 
If you buy 1 bitcoin at $2200 and then sell that entire bitcoin for lets say 100 navcoin  which we will have as the market price for this example. That makes nav coin worth $22. If navcoin stays at $22 and bitcoin rises to $2500, and you convert all your navcoin to bitcoin, you still only have $2200 worth of bitcoin which would be 0.88 btc. You've lost money. However if navcoin price doubled to $44 per navcoin and you converted to bitcoin, you would have 1.76 bitcoin. In your scenario its all how navcoin trades against bitcoin and then how bitcoin trades against the dollar.

I think it’s somewhere in the middle

Dont send double :(((( ...while I get what youre doing, youre cheapening your products and are doing more harm than good to your brand. Ive been there, done that. People are happy to paying what you ask for what they are ordering. Just give them good service and they'll be back.

Genuinely do not understand why you like bitcoin if you believe in a fiat debt based fractional reserve system. Inflation is definitely not necessary at all. 
And its very very dangerous to assume the dollar could not fluctuate dramatically overnight. It is in no way immune to true market forces. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:43:20
What is the best way to do that in your opinion. Im reluctant to trust paper wallets and Ledgers are sold out
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:04:32
So what?
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:28:13
What? Inflation never ever works long term.

You’re doing this wrong
