With futures you basically lock in the price of an item at a specific date. So let’s say you buy a futures contract of 1 BTC for $15k to be executed on 12/31. 12/31 comes around and the market price of bitcoin is $17k. Congrats, you just made $2k if you sell that BTC since you only paid $15k for that 1 BTC. Let’s say instead that bitcoin crashes to $10k, well, on 12/31 - you just paid an extra $5k for that 1 BTC.

You sure you’re not confusing futures with options?

Interesting. My research on the upcoming lightning network for BTC seems to imply more centralization being that we would need to pass through exchanges/established channels in order to process payments. Wouldn’t that bring BTC down the same path as BCH - AKA more centralization but cheaper transactions?

Does anyone actually do that?

Not bitcoin. Try a different coin. Whattomine.com

Why would 8MB block sizes centralize nodes into a few hands? - curious noob.

Yes risky. It’s basically a gamble. But it has been bullish over the long run. This sub will most likely tell you yes but the personal finance sub would say hell no.

Well yeah but how many of us are $100k in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:44:27
Holy shit. Why do BCH people think that increasing the block size is a scalable solution then? Assuming mainstream adoption, or even way before then, you would need a server farm to run the BCH blockchain.

Okay but is 8 MB the upper limit? Is 8 MB enough for mainstream adoption? This just seems like it’s a medium term fix and not scalable to the level of visa transactions.

Yes for people who own large sums of bitcoin and use it in the market for large purchases but for day to day transactions using a not-so-significant amount of appreciated bitcoin, nobody is going to be filing capital gains purely due to the accounting overhead/headache. 
Most stock brokers make it easy to file taxes on trades. I don’t know any way to do something similarly with bitcoin without manually tracking yourself.

If those exchanges/intermediaries become banks, wouldn’t that defeat the purpose of p2p? I’m afraid of banks opening their own bitcoin exchanges and forcing themselves into the lightning architecture.
