The Jim Cramer segment after the square announcement did it for me. Also, I woke up this morning and on Facebook the first thing I read is the "Rich Dad Poor Dad" guy had a post saying buy Bitcoin.

At least he didn't say "take shots"

I'm long on Bitcoin so I'm conflicted. I would love to keep setting ATHs. But also, wouldn't mind to see a drop and pick up some discounted Bitcoins.

Wow, that seems like a big stretch.

I would take them off for sure if I were you. At the Bitcoin Cash hard fork I had my BTC Coinbase and still have not got my Bcash. It's essentially free money.

What if Satoshi went and got his Driver's License picture retaken and made a really mean face. Then some scrub that looks at the Premium authorization's on Bittrex sees it come through and goes to tell the CEO what's happening. "It's Satoshi.. and he looks PISSED." While all of Bittrex is watching, Satoshi sends over millions of 2X coins. Everyone knows what's coming. Roger Ver catches word and starts crying/publicly apologizing to Satoshi on Twitter. Satoshi writes a post on r/Bitcoin, that says 'Fuck you Craig Wright, you ain't me', presses the sell button on Bittrex as r/Bitcoin collectively creams themselves.

Didn't Hal Finney live a couple blocks away from a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto? It proves nothing but a crazy coincidence.

Do I have to send them .2 first?

No offense but it seems strange to me that you've be investing in Bitcoin since 2013 and have enough to 'live comfortably for the rest of your life' but you do not already know the answer to this question.

I missed this guy 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:50:06
Care to elaborate why? He'd want to use Segwit, right?

I love it. These are going to be awesome soundbites for a documentary in 5-10 years.

No, you got lucky. It's not that easy.

Anyone remember anon bitcoin gambler? Put something like 32k of Bitcoin on a credit card and won big?

You are experiencing FOMO. The poster above had good advice but I would say do not take out debt to gamble on an investment. There is no easy money and crypto is still very high risk and you must have a stomach to deal with the volatility. If you can afford the payments easily then why don't you have cash reserves to buy right now? You don't need to answer that, just something to think about.
I'd say create a budget now and dollar cost average the money you're wanting to put in to Bitcoin monthly or weekly.

That's right, son. Now go buy a Trezor.
