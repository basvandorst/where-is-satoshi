Division is defined as repeated substraction...you can substract 0 how often?
edit: to be fair your fixed definition of undefined does exist but so does the infinite one. You can find both in literature depending on where you look.

ℕ0 includes zero... seriously try to be more than pedantic especially when you fail at it. I'm just telling you how it's used and you just try to argue.

5-7= is 0 in that case. It's for natural numbers. 
Computer says error anyway  with 5 / 0  because he can't substract infinite times 0 , that's an endless loop and you don't have a number representation for infinite so throwing an error is best you can do. There are complex data types that allow more but that's what the basic ones allow.

Propably like germany. They look at the difference sold/bought btc&lt;&gt;€ and you pay profit tax if you actually made a net profit over a year. Even if you buy goods directly with btc they consider the € price of btc at that moment you pay for the goods and want taxes on that. 
edit: this also counts when buying altcoints. So you can't just offset into a currency that ain't taxed.

As old money is used to buy the hardware influence in any new crypto-currency will mirror the old gap.

Look into EU exchanges. There are quite a few but i can't really make recomendations as i find it impossible to verify how trustworthy they are. The german one got shit on for example in forums cause people didn't get their btc but it's impossible to tell what % of trades that is and if it was later maybe resolved.
