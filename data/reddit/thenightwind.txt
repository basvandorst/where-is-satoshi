Reddit probably is as well, but more challenging.

But nobody steals ideas better and more shamelessly than Microsoft.
They do improve upon stuff, but I can't think of a single concept they sell that they came up with on their own.  Yes, they paid for SQL Server and Skype, but everything else was stolen.

BitCoin is in the public eye now? Well, I promise the politicians will either find a way to fuck it up or criminalize users.

It's called lies.  Then go to college and get a degree.  And tell more complicated lies.  Then get 20 years experience becoming 'an expert'.  Then tell more lies.  Then learn about some new up and coming technology and apply your vast knowledge of lying.... and tell more lies.
