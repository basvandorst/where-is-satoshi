Well, history’s full of examples of great men blundering in their twilight years. Newton spent them studying alchemy, Einstein tried to disprove quantum mechanics.. and they were probably 2 of the smartest humans that ever lived.

People had the same reaction to paper money. Took a few hundred years to become widespread.

Once we get to that asteroid mining, or we get fusion power, gold will only be used industrialy, and its price will reflect that. Just like any raw material, it will cost next to nothing.

it's far from rarest even now. and anything that a star can make will be extremely easy for us to make or find as well. some exotic types of matter can still be hard to make, but gold will be worthless soon.

Lol why on earth would anyone do this? And btw are you also a nigerian prince by any chance?

1 .Much better competition. 
2. Transaction fee fiasco
3. Insider trading and market manipulation
I’m not psychic but i’d be happy if this “dip” stopped at &gt;1000 usd
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:54:10
Great. Since i bought it 7 days ago it’s plus 9.7%. Meanwhile btc was minus 18%. I just bought back bitcoin yesterday for a half of iota and xrp and my portfolio is now 50% btc, 25% iota, 25% xrp. The dip had been very profitable for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:06:19
You are absolutely right. Scarcity by itself does not equal value. But bitcoin has other attributes that, when combined with scarcity, do equal value. Don’t be ignorant, do some research, all these question have been answered a million times and you are not as smart as you think you are
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:35:27
How insightful
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:06
I don’t think it will. Some other crypto, sure. Good luck picking a winner. I just put all my ex-btc into iota and ripple 50% each.  And i was a long time holder (2012)

This bet makes no sense from his side. If bitcoin crashes he will recieve much less than he stands to lose
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:56:49
but gold could very much become obsolete by nuclear transmutation, asteroid mining or some other new technology that renders it worthless. and it's 100% guaranteed to happen in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:13:50
Yup that’s exactly it. This old fart is taming bitcoin as we speak.

Not really. It’s Nick Szabo. 
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:55:57
It's not synonymous. but I'm treating privacy as one of the absolute requirements of fungibility. I can't be expected to control all my incoming transactions. If I, for example, sell something for bitcoin on the internet, I wouldn't want tainted coins that can potentially down the line be blacklisted by some entity. I'd prefer cleanly mined ones. This breaks fungibility. I just hope someone smart is working on a solution. But I think this whole community needs to realize it's a problem. And it needs to be solved.

It's been 10 years.

So, where are we currently in regards to the fungibility of bitcoin? Are we approaching any consensus solution to this problem? Are even trying to? I've been out of the loop for a while, but I still see it as a huge problem.

I think at this point it’s pretty obvious it’s nick szabo with the help of ian grigg. One of many, many clues: 
@_date: 2019-12-23 15:27:51
It's pretty obvious by now that Satoshi is Nick Szabo. And some other people, he wasn't alone..

The whole point of bitcoin is regulation, you got that right.

these lines are just as arbitrary as the constellations in the sky. human mind creates patterns out of noise.. nothing of value to see here. it will either rebound or it won't, this article is a waste of time.

Not really.. that IF THEN ELSE is terminology from an exact science. TA is bullshit. Just like astrology borrows terminology from astronomy and it does not make it less of a bullshit. Predictive power of TA is as good as a coin toss.

Why? For the sake of argument if you invest 50% in each of two things that have -1 correlation you will always be where you started. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:17:43
Maybe these two separate things aren’t corelated. Let’s wait and see. Bitcoin started dropping months before stock markets and it might be that it starts rising now, but who knows.

And what if it climbs to 150k and never drops down to 60k ever again?
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:02:30
Gold is guaranteed to be worthless in the future. How soon, that’s the only question, but either through molecular transmutation when we have enough cheap energy, or asteroid mining, or something else, the price of gold (and all other elements) will approach 0.

any raw material, no matter how useful it is, will be worth almost zero on a long enough time scale, because supply will be practically unlimited
