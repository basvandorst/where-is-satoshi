This is what they built to secure 1.95M from Europe (from article)
Im in the wrong business. Rolling governments seems more lucrative. For an already very good social/cooperative model i suggest [Vocal Eyes]( which is:
a) Free
b) Built
EDIT: Since I may have saved the EU millions here, you can send the check to:

Just noticed after upgrading 2.05 - 2.06 that the phone (old htc android 2.02 or something) that its no longer supported. Got another phone and restored from seed. All seems to be good.

Bought the HD1 before last Christmas. Didnt get a security card back then with it. Sillily, I set it up with the ledger nano wallet. Send a couple of bucks to it. Now I cant get it out.
Tried Eirc's suggestions, (Multibit restore, electrum restore etc.) Still no joy.
So here we go, heres a test for the ledger wallet. Heres my key. Free coffee for the person that can get these out of the blockchain (I cant).

Im just going to use it with greeenaddress or similar.

Yes this is what happened. Couldnt get them out on the recovery. What did you use to extract them? Tried MultiBit and Electrum myself (Lower case, just wrote them as above)

This is great thanks, good read. Happened to be in an airbnb stay at Christmas and 'the road to serfdom' was on a book shelf. Never heard of the guy but read it anyway. Very good book, well laid out. He had some very astute observations on this stuff didnt he. This passage (from the above piece):
'But if private institutions began to issue notes under some other names without any fixed rate of exchange with the official money or each other, so far as I know this is in no major country actually prohibited by law.' (this is bitcoin :0) I think the reason why it has not actually been tried is that of course we know that if anybody attempted it, the government would find so many ways to put obstacles in the way of the use of such money that it could make it impracticable. (This is looking like bitcoin too) So long, for instance, as debts in terms of anything but the official dollar cannot be enforced in legal process, it is clearly impracticable. (This is also bitcoin) Of course it would have been ridiculous to try to issue any other money if people could not make contracts in terms of it. But this particular obstacle has fortunately been removed now in most countries, so the way ought to be free for the issuing of private money.
So a lot of this theory can easily be seen in the tech. Its mad.
EDIT: Just finished reading this. Wow... very well presented theory. Great read.

Ive heard those frackers are running on empty junk bonds they bought in butterfly labs, wont end well

I agree but while everyone here is a minor investor, many people in life want to be able to just save into an asset that they dont have to move around/invest/play with just to hold on to. We have the worst of both worlds, a bad currency and no standardized saving system (banks currently give negative interest in europe).
So now the common man has to bury his money or similar. Is this what they way also?
@_date: 2015-05-11 10:56:56
This is great. Will try make a new one now. I read a few weeks ago I can put that 2fa card data on your phone, is that possible?
@_date: 2015-05-11 10:20:02
Yea, not sure what happened. Tried it a few times, for what it was, was going to burn it anyway. I'll redo the wallet with greenaddress, dont need the card for that.
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:06:59
Hey Reggie,
On slide 14, what is a 'catastrophic rollback transaction' which is provided to wallets. How would that look in code?
Also, who vetos the external data source which the facilitator uses.
Arent these just representations of value of are these actually bitcoins up to the value of the asset?

This is bullshit, its a wordpress site with no real backing.
7 days after launch they have packed it in
Im all for pumping but logistically this was a longshot, and it wasn't well planned out. They only went to Athens after setting up the site.

Listen Danny Boy. Ill give you a break when I see you land one olive outside of Greece. Otherwise, Ill put you in line with the thousands of other bitcoin business's who think that easily moving money is the only tool in the world we need. As one of your commenters pointed out:
This website is so on point !
Thats all it is so far.

Dont use the password: my testicles
Im using it to store my paper wallets as a handy online backup

Dont want to try that, they could have altered it in many ways.
