The difficulty never adjusts between blocks no matter what. And will never be below 1 regardless.
The long term average will still be 10 minutes as always, it is only the variance that will change (so I claim based on my assumptions about the structure of mining costs in the far future).

That's not right. Don't think about "getting beaten to the punch". It's like I say "who wants to pay me $5 for a 10% chance at $20?" Are you worried about other people grabbing that offer before you? No, you just decline because it isn't worth it. In Bitcoin mining everyone has different costs (various electricity and hardware wear and opportunity costs) for taking that chance  at finding the block and getting the reward. As I offer a higher amount people will gradually start buying chances. The fact that none or very few take it at the beginning and many take it later on smooshes the distribution of times to finding a block together.

1/10th of a normal reward will only be incentive enough for some miners. I don't know what fraction, but it just doesn't make sense that everyone willing to do X for Y BTC will also do X for Y/10 BTC.
The main variable is going to be whether application specific chips come to dominate mining. If so then there is no alternative use for most of the mining hardware. But for the seconds where the reward is very low it still might be better to turn off. 
Of course the anticipation of this phenomenon itself could lead some to avoid bitcoin specific chips since with a more general chip you have the added profit of moving to a more profitable job when the reward is very low.

Another way to think of it is about the long end. On those rare 1 hour waits the reward will have built up to about 6x the average reward! If you have hardware that isn't particularly efficient for mining or that is normally dedicated to some other task you might be tempted to switch over during the very high reward times.
For kicks someone should write software that turns on a CPU miner whenever the reward is above customize-able amount X. Not that it would be useful in the slightest for like 50 years.

In the far future when fees dominate the static reward the variance in block times will actually decrease.
To best see it take the most extreme case where after a block is found there are no fee transactions queued up and it is so far in the future that the fixed reward is 0.
Immediately after a block is found there is no incentive to search for another block and miners will switch to working on some other task (or just switch off if no other available task is worth the marginal cost of running). As transactions with fees pour in and the value of finding a block starts to rise more and more mining power will switch back to searching for blocks. 
Possibly most mining power will be back on very quickly resulting in nearly the same variance as now, but that depends on the details of miners marginal costs.

This is part of the beauty of Bitcoin. Those confirmations are free (in that confirming more transactions costs nothing extra). Because of the way blocks are linked together every new block really does make it harder to rewrite a block 5, 20, 5k, 20k blocks back. It doesn't really help anything to go from 19,999 to 20k confirmations and the user doesn't need to see that, but it isn't something that could be stopped to save work.

But the same thing applies to 5,000% and 1,000% profits no? Also, plenty of people were only up 10, 50, or 100% at the peak. You can't judge when to sell by your own % profit.

He doesn't get it. But it's not true that contracts are only for people who know math. And it also isn't true that it is useless or boring because they pay or they don't.
The power of being able to structure a lock so that 2/3 must approve or 1 out of a set of accountants and a CFO must approve or a majority of a board is just huge.

You should write a Forbes article explaining this.
