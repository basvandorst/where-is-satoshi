Yes, about 2 billion of them. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:11:06
2 billion grandparents, gotcha. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:07:39
You’re wrong 
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:17:39
No, socialism has left Venezuela devastated.
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:22:20
Lol right. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:20:08
Same thing can be said about the person you replied to. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:18:42
Use Venmo 
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:41:20
What? That’s the same as any currency. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:43:46
You could’ve forgotten about $14,000 if you had bought a single coin at peak. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:13:39
Help me out then, what would you compare it to, gold or maybe a foreign currency? I’m trying to figure out how bitcoin compares to other assets. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:51:21
I meant how people compare bitcoin to other assets. I'm well aware of what bitcoin is. You say you didn't lose $4,000, what other invest could you say that about when it loses $4,000 of its value?  
@_date: 2018-06-01 15:13:51
Because the stores would lose tons of money. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:17:32
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:14:26
So you're down 4k?
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:18:29
So if you were to buy a stock for $10,000 and it was now worth $6,000 you’d say you were up one stock not down $4,000?
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:31:44
I can use venmo and send cash for free
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:53:31
Why would I ever need to send 3k unless I’m buying a house or a car in which case I’d mail a check or do an ach transfer?
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:52:48
Gold has utility outside of just storing value. It can and is used to make all sorts of stuff in medical/electrical/dentistry fields. 
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:03:32
Nigga looks like Squidward
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:19:27
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:03:16
Didn't know Squidward had bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:02:11
You could cut your hair and try to get work done on that squidward nose.

This is a feature.

Remember the time Bobby Boucher showed up at halftime and the Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl, do ya? 
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:38:28
Lol “the Euro is finished.”
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:46:37
Vote Bernie 2020
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:38:00
That was a joke you ignorant fuck. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:02:04
Because I said Bernie sanders whose main platform is raising taxes
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:36:17
You'd sell because it could go lower
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:31:01
Which is more than he’ll make mining. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:56:16
consuming power
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:56:39
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:47:58
Fake bullshit. Why do you guys believe the propaganda? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:13:55
Almost like this whole crpyto thing is a scam
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:52:39
No,that just shows poor countries and countries with small populations. Bitcoin has not taken over fiat in any of those countries. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:52:00
Down $700 in the first 8 hours, nice.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:52:34

@_date: 2018-12-20 15:55:19
You already are with bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:37:48
That tree was worth a hell of a lot more last year.
