Their fees are pretty high, no? By keeping buying Bitcoin simple and user friendly it allows them to charge more than say, an exchange. I mean 4% for credit cards is pretty high, thats a 1% to 1.5% markup.

How is Lawnmower better than Coinbase's builtin reoccuring buy?
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:45:47
I'd buy an upgraded one if you'd sell.

Seems like Coinbase is on the cusp of something great, pretty odd.

I wouldn't get too excited. When it survives the retrace to 3k then it's worth getting excited over.

He is absolutely, definitely not "mostly balanced". I thought the same until I was 'red-pilled', and now you can really start to see the subtle jabs (or not subtle) while totally ignoring other topics. Putting TrumpCoin next to InsaneCoin, for example. 
But this piece was fair I would say. EOS is a joke.

Banning btc hurts crypto overall as it sets a precedent. It won't happen.

Why on earth would you sell before a major support target?

What's average size?
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:27:33
Only a 20-30% decrease?

It should concern a single, small group of people that I would hope already have enough online discpline to not be stupid with how they expose their financial status. 
It has merit that BF could independently verify some users as being legitimate whales and create a set of data that they could then trade on top of. However, there is ZERO benefit to tracking the userbase as a whole as I would venture that at least 30% of the data is unreliable. 
The thing is if you have assets in the millions, you should at some point have been told by someone in a strong technical position or colleague to **never use free applications**. Free = you are the product. When your product value is millions (literally) times more valuable than the average pleb, you learn to protect it to the best of your ability.

I've had a rant or two in their telegram channel towards a few users who are clueless in regards to what is going on here.
**First**: The application requests zero permissions when installed. It has ZERO access to PII, therefore it cannot mine it.
**Second**: In regards to position size, or anything of the sort, the data in regards to you is not 100% accurate. I know dozens of people with fake blockfolio accounts for learning. In addition to that, those who use it for trading update it AFTER their trade has completed, if it all. 
**Third**: It is a free app that provides a great service, great support (their chat support is very helpful) and has zero ads. You as the user are the product. Expect this with ANY free service in the digital world.
This is nothing but bullshit FUD clickbait. Do not worry.

Ok, I can see two people comparable. Especially with two cars. Fair point!

I will be pulling my money off coinbase due to yesterday's fiasco. Not only are the fees for shifting from crypto to fiat absurd, (btc wallet to USD wallet, never leaves the site) the site always manages to crash on dumps while remaining mostly OK during pumps when new money is being added. 
That is not a coincidence.

Lol. No. You find me a decent living arrangement in a major city and i can find you a better quality of life outside of one always. The commute to work is the biggest benefit to a city life, but don't pretend like its cheaper.
