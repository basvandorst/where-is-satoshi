A currency backed by the Fed can also be manipulated to ease a recession - a tangible problem caused by tangible factors.

That issuer also forces you to pay in their alt-coin to live on their land (taxes). Otherwise they have guns and an army that could mess up your life ��.

True, it was very temporary (the Brits had to pull it from the ERM).
But you’re right, GBP is still around.

Didn’t George Soros manipulate the markets to break the British Pound though?

The way I see it is that company of the shares you hold will (hopefully) make wealth, whether it's in USD, JPY, or BTC. Bitcoin's not competing with Apple's ability to generate net income.
And if he's close to retirement, I wouldn't suggest he hold onto significant amount of Bitcoin.

Agreed. Eg. Bitcoin does not effect Microsoft from making wealth. People buy equities expecting Microsoft to generate wealth, whether it’s in USD, Yen, Peso, or Bitcoin. It’s that underlying fundamental that drives a shares value. It’s value is driven by its business and operation to create wealth, regardless of currency or denominator
Bitcoin is a store of value and (hopefully) will be accepted as a currency. But there is no underlying wealth-generating fundamental. Bitcoin doesn’t pay dividends or interest. It’s value is driven by supply and demand.
I read below that it is a commodity and I agree with that.
Boring Economics and Finance Professional here. I’m not as knowledgeable in Bitcoin so if anything’s wrong on the Bitcoin side, feel free to throw my opinion in the trash.
Edit: TBH, I realized I repeated what the post above said haha.

One of my friends had a meeting with this dude for seed funding for his startup. Interesting guy - partially owns the Warriors, his fund does a lot of work with companies looking to make a social impact in education, healthcare, etc. Seems to be an honest guy - hopefully not trying to hype it up to dump it later.

I don't think clever people use the word "buddy."
