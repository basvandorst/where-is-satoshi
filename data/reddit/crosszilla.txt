I planned on using my bank account as the basis until further information on how this should be taxed is available. If it hasn't hit your bank account you haven't truly "realized" the profit yet. I'm sure during tax season there will be more info here floating around.

Price already seems to be recovering back to 18k. I think someone just became a millionaire and it caused the brief dip.

I sold enough to gain back my entire usd investment so I don't feel more anxiety over it, today has been brutal on me. Still have a good chunk of change to play with and it's easier on the psyche playing with house money

If you bought it for the long haul this is just a blip in the radar

This depends on your motives. Are you trying to day trade? Wait for a dip to ensure you buy low. Are you trying to be in it for the long term? Buy now. We just came out of a few days of correction dips, I would expect it to start rising fairly steadily. That all said, in the end you should do what you feel comfortable with, not what some bloke on the internet tells you.

Never too late to get in. Who knows, maybe in 5 years you'll be kicking yourself over thinking it was too late when it was up to 10k

Fun to watch on Coinbase. Too bad they've disabled any buy/sells of bitcoin. I've had several windows where I could have bought low or sold high and made some money off this volatility.

This probably only happens if bitcoin becomes the ubiquitous world currency. The market cap would need to be the largest of any asset from my quick 5 minutes of research. Right now btc has a cap of 200 odd billion. To get to a million you'd need that to be roughly 50x which is a fair amount more valuable than gold.

Seems to have leveled out around 17k for the time being. Maybe a big fish decided it was time to unload before it hit 20k

I think you're definitely on to something. Look at Venezuela, the user who's been posting about the impact bitcoin has had there was what convinced me bitcoin was for real.

I believe it's just the capital gains rate on your profit.

Seems to be climbing back up in the last few minutes. I imagine it's similar to earlier this week where it reached an ATH, word got out, and people started grabbing profit when it dropped.

And +1186.19% for the year. Whenever I'm freaking out, that trend line puts things in perspective. I think a lot of people are just upset that they bought in at the wrong time (my latest buy included, I thought it was going to recover when it got back up to 10.5 yesterday afternoon and bought a bit), but if you plan to HODL the long term trend is far more important than a couple short term crashes. People are just far more emotionally invested (and quick to panic) when they put in money and it immediately becomes worth less
