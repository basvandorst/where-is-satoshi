Hi Johannes, I have several videos on my channel but tried to only post the ones I consider relevant to the bitcoin world:
1) the one about fractional reserve banking because it's a frequently debated topic in the crypto world (rightfully so because you cannot analyze and discuss bitcoin without referring to the alternatives such as banks)
2) the one about Austrian Economics vs. Keynesianism because a lot of you guys are Austrians and I thought you'd find the comparison interesting, perhaps something you can share with people from the offline world
3) the one about hyperinflation because it's something a lot of people on this subreddit are concerned with, ok maybe not Zimbabwe-ish hyperinflation but rather dangerously high inflation
4) the one about the Dot Com Bubble because I think it gives the bitcoin world an interesting perspective; an insanely disruptive phenomenon which generated a bubble that burst but which rose from its ashes to bring us where we are today
5) the current one, the supply and demand video because I think supply and demand represents perhaps the most important economics lesson people need to pay attention to; I mean in bitcoin's case, one of the main selling points is represented by the fact that it's finite (21 million cap). Therefore, the supply is finite and if the demand (people who want to buy and hold, people who want to use bitcoins for transactions and so on) increases, all of us will be very happy :)
I will actually have one about cryptocurrencies soon, working on it as we speak. Explaining cryptocurrencies in one minute is going to be my biggest challenge yet because I want to do it right. I want this to be the type of video you can show to your aunt at a family reunion without her giving you the look... easier said than done haha.
