Did finex get their seized funds back? If not, then I assume they still aren't fully backed.
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:42:55
Correct, nobody cares about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:08:10


Oh well, you nearly made it. If you can't keep things civil then I'm afraid I'll have to end this conversation.
Good day, sir.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:05:10
You *just* said it was fud.

Aka "please leave my echo chamber, I cannot refute your point and it makes me uncomfortable"

And may your bags never be heavy ;)

Priced in partially reserved tether!

"This guy doesn't believe bitcoin works, but instead of countering his points to show he is incorrect, I'm going to imply that he is mentally ill, lol GOTTEM"
Typical crypto swill-bucket rattling.

Is this ironic?
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:13:26


It's supposed to be a form of electronic cash though isn't it? Why is wanting to spend it considered a negative?
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:14:00


Specifically that the market cap is "Priced in partially reserved tether". After that you told me to "Enjoy that poor life".
So not only can you not argue, you also apparently can't read. This sub is no better than r/btc.
Also, calling *me* a troll, while completely ignoring my point and saying "Enjoy that poor life", bit fucking rich pal. *You're* the troll from where I'm standing.
What is it with crypo-zealots calling you a troll when you make a point that triggers their dissonance? I've seen it from all the tribes.

With answers from the community like that, no wonder bitcoin adoption is in the toilet.
Also, I had you at +5 in RES, time to set that back to zero I guess.
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:06:46
yikes, have to post this one on r/buttcoin then.
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:27:13
And so the echo chamber is reinforced! Dissenting opinion is handwaved and insulted away, leaving only the truly faithful to jerk each others opinions.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:00:03


Has tether recovered the $850 million that was seized? If not, then they are not fulled backed are they? Therefore it's not fud, it's facts.
Now, let's see if you can provide an *actual* response to that which includes facts, and doesn't include insults. I know it's tough, but give it a try. You know, I'm willing to change my mind if you could argue a valid point.
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:55:53
Good counterargument. Enjoy your "tokens of the future", that have near zero adoption after 10 years.
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:11:38


Doesn't that suggest that bitcoin has failed as a project, and the only thing left to do with it is sit on it in the hopes of trading it for more money in the future?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:11:36
You should have posted this *before* it started crashing, captain hindsight.
@_date: 2019-05-09 12:07:28


Not strictly true:

No, what is worse is leveraging a short on an asset with wafer thin orderbooks on unregulated exchanges where whales splash around.
