That's silly - of course many other shitcoins exist. But they are not Bitcoins, and they do not have the value of Bitcoins. Bitcoin scarcity is a known proven fact at ~21 million.
BCH is maybe a few $100 ?
Bitcoin Gold a few $10 ?
Bitcoin Diamond a few $ ?
A few worth a few cents, and a vast number worth almost nothing.
Which is how it will always remain - any new coin with the word 'Bitcoin' in its name is going nowhere now.
Meanwhile Bitcoin itself is leaving all the other shitcoins far behind - because of its known fixed scarcity.

So much silly nonsense -
There is no evidence Psyche 16 is made of gold - it's a standard nickel-iron asteroid.
Even if it was, bringing it to earth would NOT make everyone rich : 1) the miners won't just give it all away, 2) this much gold would crash the price of gold to zero.
This story is agitprop aimed at keeping the gold price down.

Many persons do not understand the crucial difference between printing money and "printing" money.
Inaccurate titles like this one help to increase that confusion.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:14:42
Mining is based on a hash function of the block - a complex formula that takes all the data in the block and spits out one big number based on it (like a signature or checksum) which is different for every block, and which changes with any change in the block data.
That number (also called the hash) is essentially a long string of random digits. In decimal examples might look like '651987369069' or '27059164970'. So that means about 1 in ten results will end with '0', right ? And about 1 in a hundred will end with '00', see ? 1 in 1000 with '000' ...
It actually happens in binary, but miners essentially try a LARGE number of hashes to get a result which ends with the right number of 0s. They do this by changing one of the fields in the block (called the 'nonce') thru 1,2,3,4 etc. until they hit a hash result with the right number of 0s. (The right number of 0s is changed every 2 weeks so that successful hashes occur every 10 minutes.)
Many miners are all trying to get a successful hash at the same time (around 75 million million million per SECOND currently !)
As soon as a miner gets a successful hash, they quickly broadcast their resulting block onto the BTC network - other miners can very quickly confirm that success (because it is very easy to CHECK a hash) and so they all abandon that hash attempt and start a new one with new transactions from the pool of waiting ones. (Miners get to CHOOSE which transactions to put into a block, that's why higher fee transactions get done quicker, and also why free transactions can go thru when BTC is quiet.)
That successful block is added to everyone's copy of the blockchain - so that set of transactions now have 1 confirmation.
Inside that block is the destination address for the BTC reward which thus receives 12.5 BTC from it. (That reward amount halves every few years, and the next one is about a year from now.)

Readers beware !
The Fed does NOT literally print money, it does NOT physically manufacture currency (the BEP does that.)
However, the popular, but incorrect phrase "print money" is almost always used for these stories - just like almost all BTC stories show that silly physical NOT bitcoin souvenir.
Rather - 
The Fed **creates money as numbers in bank computers**. When the Fed creates 75 billion $, someone types in "75 000 000 000" and presses enter (essentially.) The Fed did NOT just physically print 128 billion in currency.
Posters should consider informing their readers, rather than mislead them with incorrect terms.
The amount of extant physical currency (about a trillion) is only a tiny fraction of the total number of dollars that exist as numbers in bank computers (hundreds of trillions.)
Interested readers should be aware of the critical difference between literally printing money (currency), and the handy, but inaccurate phrase "printing money". Note that many sources (such as the BEP web page) confuse the term 'money' with 'currency' - helping to spread the confusion.

Fortunately, BTC can be divided into very small pieces - currently as fine as a 100 millionth of a BTC, or 0.000,000,01 BTC. It's called a 'satoshi'.
There are already about 1,400 million million satoshis.
That's roughly **200,000 satoshis for every person on the planet** now.
Lightning already supports a thousandth of a satoshi. That would be two hundred million milli-satoshis per person.
Plenty of units to go 'round :)

You mean a CD or DVD with a computer game on it ?
A physical object.
A BTC is NOT a physical object, it can NOT be delivered to your door - it is delivered NON physically to a wallet.
The term 'physical' here is clearly incorrect, and has only been used because of its usage for gold - which IS physical.
The correct word would probably be 'actual', but that's a rather loose term.
But the word physical will continue to be used, and posters will continue to insist it is the right term, largely because it is so hard for most persons to admit being wrong.

It's important to understand the difference between "printing money" and printing money.
The QE process created billions of $ - in the form of numbers in bank computers - NOT physical currency.
The amount of $ existing as numbers in bank computers is far far more than the amount of physical currency.

Gday, the details are explained here :
Seems the passphrase is indeed like a 25th seed word, which does create/access a new wallet.
So the answer is : NO.
**You're safe** \- if you put BTC into the wallet using a passphrase, then the passphrase is indeed required to access those BTC. (**Unless they can guess the passphrase**.)
Presumably, you have already re-covered your wallet and moved the BTC ASAP, right ?
kzx-kzx is probably thinking of the PIN number, not the optional pass-phrase.

So ... liquidating a short can in principle be either way :
1) abandoning your position and cutting your losses (got it wrong), or
2) realising your profits (got it right)
But considering the current situation of a strongly rising market, this is far more likely to be the first case.
Furthermore - this admission helps to increase the bulls confidence.
It's a virtuous circle, all the way to the moon !

Gday, OK, I'll go see what formal sources I can track down for you.
Firstly, I can mention 'Gold Warriors' by the Seagraves, which looks into Yamashita's Gold. Supposedly Marcos had a stash of 73,000 tons when he fled. Apparently, later, the Philippines military initiated a court case (reported in Soldier of Fortune magazine IIRC?) to get their share of the 63,000 tons they helped loot for Marcos.
Fascinating read.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:41:26
If 51% of miners agree, then (almost) anything could be changed, including supply - but that is extremely unlikely, as it would mean BTC is broken. No-one would want that.
Elsewise - yes, anyone can make a new fork, and they have - such as :
Bitcoin cash - now $400 (and at risk of 51% attack)
Bitcoin gold - now $23
Bitcoin diamond - now $1
Many others like Bitcoin Z - 1/50 of one cent
None of them are Bitcoin, they have little effect on Bitcoin. 
One critical reason for that is the vast amount of mining power committed to BTC - making it very hard to break with a 51% attack.
New coins start with little mining power, and no incentive to start mining - making them trivially easy to break. It's almost impossible to make a new coin succeed now.
There have been reports recently that BCash is now susceptible to a 51% attack, and Bcash has been heavily pumped on forums and sites etc. lately.  Watch that space.
Bitcoin was the first, and so will always be the best. Increasing price attracts miners, making a 51% attack harder, making it more secure, and thus more valuable.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:23:35
No, there is nothing special about one BTC. There is no thing, not a file, nor serial number, nor piece of data that represents one specific BTC.
Really it boils down to amounts stored at addresses, e.g. :
address XY321 has 0.00015 BTC
address ZA456 has 0.5 BTC
address AB987 has 25.6 BTC
address NM657 has 0.96548763 BTC
(and many addresses have 0.0)
Arbitrary amounts of BTC move from one address to another. There is no essential difference between 0.99999999 BTC and 1.0 BTC and 1.00000001 BTC.)
The amount currently allows for 8 digits resolution (a satoshi, about 6 millicents currently), but it can be taken to further finer resolution if BTC becomes extremely valuable.
When a BTC is a million $, then a satoshi is a cent.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:37:16
It will make more sense if you look at a BTC market (or any similar market really) and look at the two order books :
* the sell book is the list of orders (asks) ready to SELL when the price goes up to a certain price - this list of prices goes upwards from the last price and is usually shown in red;
* the buy book is the list of orders (bids) ready to BUY when the price drops to a certain price - this list goes down and is usually green.
Those orders are sometimes called 'makers' - they make the price. Often also called a limit buy/sell - limited to a fixed price.
you can simply choose to buy or sell right now at whatever price, that's called a market buy/sell. In that case you will use up the current (opposite) order book, as much as needed for your buy/sell - you'd be a 'taker'.
So if you made a market buy order, the site would simply allocate you the orders on the sell book - starting from the lowest price and moving up the sell orders until your order is fulfilled.
That's why buying pushes the price up, and vice versa - because making a buy drives up thru the sell book, making a sell drives down thru the buy book.
the price that gets reported is simply the last sale, but various markets will vary in price, and various site etc. will give averages.

Thanks, so if I go short on BTC (which means borrowing someone's BTC then selling it for the now high price) then the collateral I have to provide as security is a BTC ? Not $ ?
But then, if a BTC is available for collateral, then the price never matters because that BTC is there waiting to be repaid ? (And if I have a BTC available for collateral, why borrow it ?)
I thought the collateral would be $ - the current BTC price, plus some margin - so that if the price rises (the wrong way) to that margin then that causes a squeeze, or margin call.
What am I missing here ?
