the reason is, because thats how markets work.
educate yourself.
When demand exceeds supply, suppliers tend to raise their prices, but when supply exceeds demand, suppliers will tend to decrease their prices in order to make sales. Consumers who can afford the higher prices may still buy, but others may forgo the purchase altogether, demand a better price, buy a similar item, or shop elsewhere. As the price rises, suppliers may also choose to increase production, or more suppliers may enter the business.

if too many miners stopped as a "group action" ... then the difficulty would be so high, that the next block could not be found by the remaining miners, and if no next block was found, the system would come to a grinding halt.

the difficulty is set so blocks are found about every ten minutes.  if 3/4 of the miners stopped -theoretically, since this would never happen- then it could take them hours or days to find the next block.  as there needs to be 2016 blocks for the next difficulty change, if that took 3+ months or longer to happen, the system would collapse, transactions would not get confirmed, etc.
after the 2016 were found, then yes the difficulty would go down, if then, the other 3/4 of miners joined in, blocks would be found every ten seconds, until the next 2016 blocks, where the difficulty would just go back to their previous levels.
gaining nothing, except destroying the system for a few months.

1) bitcoin payments do not get reversed
2) it takes on average 10 minutes for the first confirmation, every confirmation after that increases the difficulty for any double-spend (a longer chain) to happen.

True, but gold originally became a medium of exchange because of its scarcity and because it was shiny (it looked good) and it did not degrade over time and could not be faked.

how is this a massive problem?  if funds are sent, and another similar transaction from the same address is not done withing a second of the other one and there is a mining fee, then 100% of the time, the transaction will be confirmed.
you can detect a double spend immediately.  
to pull off a double-spend, the person would need to successfully mine the next 6-7 blocks in a row (not something they'll be doing for 0.001 btc)
when more people use the payment protocol, you can make sure that the mining fee is added when you accept the payment if the person did not add it.
don't see what's such a massive problem about this?  please enlighten me.

It very well might - the same as any market is.  If/when it is a problem, something will need to be done to stop it or disallow it.  The miners could easily accomplish this with changes to the core protocol.
I believe some things have been done, or discussed due to Satoshi Dice clogging up the networks early on.
As for the divisible part, a while back I made a website (nothing special) that prices bitcoin in Satoshis -  - but at the bottom it shows the current divisible amounts and their names if they exist.

sure, today they want that.  because they don't trust the network or understand how it works. 
as time goes on, this won't be the case.  there was a time where people balanced their checkbook (and they prob still should) because they didn't trust the transactions.
as time goes on, and wallets check for double spends by default, the first confirmation won't be requested.

For one, there is no begging for bitcoins, period. 
For two, the forclosure process is a minimum two year long process, with many many options to extend that.  So no payment of 3800 would stop you from getting current, as if you are being evicted, that means a sheriff sale has already occurred and no payments will matter at this point if it was legit.

I vaguely remember reading something about it being a coding decision.
I think floating point numbers go to 17 decimal points beyond the main digit, and so 8 was picked for some reason related to this.
or was it related to long, where you can fit all 8 decimals + 8 digits before the decimal into a single long integer?
I could be wrong.

double spend isn't about which transaction is first.  the blockchain doesn't just rely on luck of the first transaction being included first.
in a distributed network, it really doesn't matter which is first or not, all that matters is that previously spent inputs are not spent again, and the blockchain already handles this.
the only way a double spend could occur, is if the person confirming the block includes both as valid (a change to the system on their own side).  and then confirms more blocks than the network confirms in order to make a longer chain.
i think you are trying to solve a problem that is already solved "well enough".
it is also very easy to detect a double spend, as they have to occur almost at the same time.  you can't have a 2 minute lag time.
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:08:05

313173 8 minutes ago, the block before it 313172 5 minutes ago, 313171 3 minutes ago.
so the top (last) block was done first, then the middle done next, then the bottom (first) block done last.
based on the timestamps, the submitted order was 313173, 313172, 313171 and should be the other way around.

you simply used output volume.  of course output volume is down as price goes up.

Correct me if I'm wrong, and there's a solution to this - but if I have a corner shop, and I want to sell a can of coke, I can get the payment via visa in seconds, that much is genius. The confirmation time however is far too long.
Sometimes it can take 512 days before the person can chargeback the funds, and I will not get the funds for at least 4 weeks and need to keep $10,000 in escrow with Visa and their minimum charge is $2.50 so I end up losing $1.50 for the transaction. If someone wants a can of coke they're not going to be hanging around for any longer than 20 seconds after they've sent a payment to leave the shop.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:22:57
because you can make instant payments across the entire globe at near zero cost (currently something like 0.00001 btc per transaction).
the current risk, is that as this is only 5 years old, it might totally fail and be worthless.  time lessens this risk.
the US and China are at risk all the time, are you kidding me?  the US is in debt up to it's ears and beyond, they have even had their credit rating downgraded in the past year.  you honestly think there is no risk there?
the USD was backed by gold until the 70's ... since then, it is FIAT only.  You might want to do a google search on what USD and CNY are backed by truly...

True, bitcoin is far more harsh in that respect.  and is most likely one of the things that needs to be addressed before widespread adoption could take place (give you the ability to be notified of a pending transaction, and then stop it before it's confirmed by the network - or something like this)
a hacker gaining access to your bank account, could setup an ACH withdrawl, "pay" a bill to a fake location.  if you catch it within a day or so, you could get the bank to reverse the transaction.  this is assuming you actually catch it.
but they would know the account the funds were transferred to, and i'm not sure what the next step is from there.

coinbase and bitpay are their own merchant service providers.  I'm not sure if they work with others that you may use, you would need to ask your current MSP if they would integrate with another MSP.

Ten minutes was specifically chosen by Satoshi as a tradeoff between first confirmation time and the amount of work wasted due to chain splits. After a block is mined, it takes time for other miners to find out about it, and until then they are actually competing against the new block instead of adding to it. If someone mines another new block based on the old block chain, the network can only accept one of the two, and all the work that went into the other block gets wasted. For example, if it takes miners 1 minute on average to learn about new blocks, and new blocks come every 10 minutes, then the overall network is wasting about 10% of its work. Lengthening the time between blocks reduces this waste.
As a thought experiment, what if the Bitcoin network grew to include Mars? From the farthest points in their orbits, it takes about 20 minutes for a signal to travel from Earth to Mars. With only 10 minutes between new blocks, miners on Mars would always be 2 blocks behind the miners on Earth. It would be almost impossible for them to contribute to the block chain. If we wanted collaborate with those kinds of delays, we would need at least a few hours between new blocks.

Yes, exactly why nobody is running out to buy bitcoins to purchase their goods from overstock/tiger direct/any other merchant.
No reason to buy at a 1% markup (take 3-4 days for the ACH transfer) - deal with volitility, to buy at the exact same price you can buy using your credit card for.
For mass adoption, buying with bitcoin must be cheaper to both the consumer and the merchant than using a credit card.  simple as that.

Part of me wishes that all bidders bid at $0.01 just so the government doesn't get much off these coins, then did something charitable with the coins instead of just selling them for a profit. (send a small fraction of a coin to every person on the planet for instance - aol cd style)
alas, that would be in a perfect world.

bitcoin up untiil last year was mostly for the "tech savvy" ... you had to run your own bitcoin-qt wallet, you most likely mined, etc.
For the general public, services like blockchain.info for a wallet, or coinbase for buying/selling or bitpay for merchants is required.  The average person is not 'techy'.
what you should learn tho, is how money works and flows.  that would help you a lot to understand bitcoin.  but it is not a requirement.
these days, you simply need to know how to scan a qr code with the app on your phone and input an amount.

i don't think you understand what the data in the graph you posted is.  You posted output volume.  output volume is the # of coins used in the output of the transaction.
so in 2011 when the price per bitcoin was $20, to send $100 you would send 5 bitcoin and so the output volume would be 5.  in 2014 when the price is $620, to send $100 the output volume will be 0.161 bitcoin to send the same amount.
so that graph is not an indicator of the "health" of the network.  that graph will go down as price goes up, and you want that graph to go down.
or maybe you are just trying to make people scared.

when more people get excited and transact more, volume goes up, sure.  that's during the price spikes.
when earnings releases happen in the stock market, volume spikes up, same thing here.  like i said, this must be the first time you've seen market graphs.  they don't go straight up, non stop.  and in times of low news and low hype, they'll move down.  that's how markets work.
my point is, the amount of USD transacted daily has steadily risen on the long term.
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:39:55
output volume is not the only indicator of how "healthy" the bitcoin economy is.
There is transaction volume: 
There is # of unique Addresses used: 
There is hash rate: 
There is # of "blockchain" wallets: 
and that's just metrics from blockchain.
There is money coming in the form of startup capital, there are new companies being formed all the time, etc.
you can't simply use one metric to determine if the economy is "sick" or not.
Especially output volume.  As the conversion rate goes up, the output volume should go down, as it takes less coin to do the same transactions.
This graph might be a better indicator: 
edit: using your same logic - it's clear from this image:   that the apple stock is "sick" because the volume is the same as it was in 1990.

True.  if the 1btc price tops $10,000 you would be doing good.  However, if that was the case, you would be much better off spending  the $3000 now on buying up 3.5 coins, then having them trickle in for the next 8 months.

Refunds and Adjustments.
Refund Procedures. In the event that you wish to issue a refund to a purchaser, BitPay can handle this. You can decide to issue a partial refund or the full amount of the initial purchase. You can also decide whether to issue the original amount of the invoice in your local currency or in the number of Bitcoins paid. If you do not have enough funds in your BitPay account to cover the refund, BitPay may require you to deposit Bitcoins into your BitPay account to cover the refund to the purchaser. Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate determined by BitPay, following the guidelines found here: 
Disclosure of Your Refund Policy. Merchants are required to have a clear refund policy for their customers. We recommend you refund the amount of the initial purchase in the currency in which the item was priced.
Purchaser Complaints. Purchasers filing complaints about a purchase will be forwarded to you for resolution. BitPay reserves the right to terminate accounts which receive excessive complaints.

well no, it wasn't automatic for the longest time (up until about 3 months ago).  we manually took the payouts, manually split them up and then manually distributed them.  After doing it manually for a year, we found that ghash.io has the ability to do all this for us, direct from the mining site, and since then we simply get out payouts when they happen and each of us get our part of it.  There is no one person centrally pooling them then distributing them, it's just easier for all of us.
like i said, if more pools offered this, i'd be using them.  Alas, ghash.io is the only one I've found that offers this feature, so that's where we are mining.
perhaps we are a small portion of miners doing this method, but if not for that, we'd still be on other mining pools.

Per them, that was prior to the LLC being formed.
But you are right.  nobody should own 51% of the network.  but creating unnecessary caps posts doesn't help anything.
Back in July 2014, the developers said they were already creating ways to stop this if it actually became an issue, which it has not been yet.
even if ghash.io decided to double-spend ... so what.  people would leave them in droves, their business model would collapse, and bitcoin would go on without them.

price does not go up based on merchants accepting bitcoin.  price goes up when there is less supply and more demand (meaning - more USERS) who are buying bitcoins.
if anything, more merchants would make the price go down, as people are then selling their coins for products.
price won't go up due to merchants, until more users see a benefit in paying with bitcoin over paying with their credit card.  and until merchants offer discounts for buying with bitcoin, this will not occur.

@_date: 2014-08-15 19:39:40
all of the above.
you have inputs (what you can spend, that you have not spent before - what you would think of as batches) and outputs (where you spend it to).  all inputs must have an output from a previous transaction that it came from, all the way back to when the piece of coin was first created (the coinbase).
so it's a ledger, and an inventory.... lets call it legendary. (ledger / inventory)

not really a tough question, pretty simple really.  the answer is because bitcoin is new and must exist for a time in a FIAT currency world.  as such, there must be an exchange rate (the same as there is  an exchange rate for everything in any free market economy - stocks,euros, yen, bonds, gold, etc).
until that time period ends where FIAT is not the dominant currency, there will always be a fluctuating exchange rate for bitcoin, and even afterwords it will always have an exchange rate to other coins.

as far as a name ... sure.  but to use it's too confusing:
1 btc = 1.00000000 btc
1 bit = 0.00000100 btc
1 sat = 0.00000001 btc
I don't get why anyone would want to use 'bits' ... it just adds another level of complexity to something that most people already do not understand.
the only reason it might have any traction, is because it's then expressed like dollars are with 2 decimal places past the main level.  but if it was true to the 'cent' (percent) then we'd use bitcents or 0.01000000 as the main value.

not at all, clearly they can't verify your identity because they do not have the data you are being asked for.  so most likely, they will not remove the 2FA.
all i'm saying is, i'm glad they dont simply remove it on a whim because they were asked to do it.
My guess would be, they want the name on the ID to match the name on the account.  if there is no name, or you made one up for the account, sorry.
my guess is, you'll never get access to that account again.  so my original point stands, backup your 2FA data and do not rely on a website to reset it for you (this defeats the whole purpose).

i would think so, but can never say with a certainty until later.  a 100$ drop at the end of the Chinese day and start of the us day is not large or sudden.  considering a week ago prices were in the 700's.
it could be a million things, but is most likely simply supply and demand.  a large sell.
if it drops from 950 to 450, thats sudden and needs news.
a 10% drop after a 30% gain is nothing news worthy.  hence, spam.

I dont' know enough about high frequency trading to know how to answer that - altho looking at satoshi dice - i would say yes.
As for divisible.  1 bitcoin = 1.00000000 (8 zeros) where the last place position is called a Satoshi.
So really 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 Satoshi.
That's what it's currently divisible by, but this can be expanded if needed fairly simply.

I think you are confusing the two.
A node does not process the transactions, it spreads them to the rest of the network - which all nodes do, regardless of the fee.
The miner solves the block and determines which transactions get into the block or not (based on priority).
So to get transactions with 0 fees into the block, you would need to setup a mining operation that processes ALL transactions regardless of the fee, and then be able to solve the next block that contains that transaction before the rest of the network solves the next block which does not contain it.

not to mention, the greatest part of bitcoin is that there is no central authority.  any CoinValidation would need to rely on a "trusted" party to determine the blacklist status of coins (and get the network to trust this central authority).  this fundamentally breaks the entire idea of bitcoin, and who is this "trusted" party to be?

agreed, but the miners provided by this would also need to solve blocks faster than the rest of the network (or at least, solve them in a timeframe fast enough to  make a difference).
Nodes will help the network for faster propagation, but will not get 0 fee transactions into the blocks.  Think OP doesn't know the difference (and it's complex stuff, so it's hard to figure it out - i don't blame him).

well, you'd have to look at every input of all the tx's that make up the total balance, then trace each of those inputs back to which coinbase that came from.
it would be a lot of work, but i'm pretty sure it's possible.

The only thing I find sad about the current bitcoin ecosystem in all of this.  at a 1% exchange rate (coinbase, bitpay) on a $4500 invoice, the seller to get their funds into bitcoin would pay $45 and the receiver to get their funds out of bitcoin would pay $45.
so until the day people simply hold and exchange bitcoin to bitcoin and do not convert to FIAT ... it's still kinda pricey for transactions (altho, still slightly less).

the creation of bitcoins has a limit.  every four (ish - it's actually a bit less, as it's tied to the block amounts) years, the new mined amount is reduced.
Take a look at the whitepaper on how and why this was decided on the method.
ultimately, bitcoin is deflationary (meaning - the amount of available coins will go down over time) vs. traditional FIAT that is inflationary (meaning - the amount will go up).
currently, 25 btc are produced every 8ish minutes.  this amount will be halved in approximately 120 weeks (see:

I was under the impression that you could trace the inputs all the way back to the coinbase.  so you can trace any coin all the way back to where it started, it does not get 'mixed' in with other values (each tx will contain a number of inputs)
the problem might be tho, that your 0.1 btc might have come from hundreds or thousands of different coinbases.

the other beauty of the current system, is that not all nodes need to know about other nodes or transactions to do transactions.
it would be a nightmare of bandwidth if your phone had to accept all transactions on the network (currently what, 2/sec on average on a slow day? ) and reference the past 10 it sees to prove it's own tx as valid.  by the time it submits it, there would be many other tx's also being submitted almost at the same time, none of them knowing about each other.  
now scale this out to the visa levels, where there are more than 7,000 transactions a second going on.  your phone would not be able to keep up.

until FIAT goes away entirely (many many many years out) you will most likely get your loans from bitcoin in the FIAT conversion.  So you'll get $1000 USD loaned from bitcoin, and pay back whatever that exchange rate in USD is going forward, plus interest.

So with the rise of prices of bitcoin, nobody will be doing loans with their bitcoin until the price is pretty stable.

Sorry it happened, but it was not MTGOX that was hacked, it was your insecure password and security settings.

Los Angeles - - BitTorrent Founder and CEO Bram Cohen and Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA) Chairman and CEO Dan Glickman announced today that the motion picture industry and BitTorrent, Inc. are collaborating with the goal of inhibiting film piracy. Bram Cohen developed a revolutionary technology for websites to make large content files available on the Web and that technology is often used by others illegally to distribute movies and television shows. Today Cohen confirmed BitTorrent, Inc.’s commitment to removing links that direct users to copies of pirated content owned by MPAA companies from its search engine at BitTorrent.com. The announcement today is historic in that two major forces in the technology and film industries have agreed to work together and proactively identify ways to l and to promote constructive innovation in this area.
This is Bram Cohen, the creator of the BitTorrent protocol, and Ludvig (Ludde) Strigeus, the writer of µTorrent.
Together, we are pleased to announce that BitTorrent, Inc. and µTorrent AB have decided to join forces. BitTorrent has acquired µTorrent as it recognized the merits of µTorrent's exceptionally well-written codebase and robust user community. Bringing together µTorrent's efficient implementation and compelling UI with BitTorrent's expertise in networking protocols will significantly benefit the community with what we envision will be the best BitTorrent client.

to make mining anywhere near profitable, price would have to up up 100% from where it is today.
a 100GH machine brings somewhere like 0.01 btc per day (approx $5).  The price-per-GHS is 0.01 btc currently.
so to get 100GH you would spend approximately 1 btc and your return is 100+ days assuming no hashrate increases.
basically, a losing value, unless price is REALLY up today.

happens all the time, use the search feature.
it's because coinbase does not have enough cash on the exchanges to do purchases for the users, and transferring that cash takes a few days (legacy banking).
happens any time there is large volume buys.
and for the record, if they were insolvent, they would take your buy and "give" you coins that are also "given" to another user.  so no, they are not insolvent, and they are doing a great job at making sure they do not go insolvent.

Just because I have 5 btc (current value of $3185) doesn't mean i want to go spend 0.5btc ($319) "just because".
On the same side, if i had $3185 fiat, doesn't mean i want to just go spend $319.
That said ... *IF* i wanted to buy some computer parts, i'd consider buying them from TigerDirect (or anywhere else that accepts bitcoin) and then rebuying those bitcoin (altho, this will then cost me 1% more).
Which is why I hold to the fact, that anyone accepting bitcoin should be doing so with at least a 1% discount if not more.  (since they no longer have to worry about chargebacks and their CC fees, altho they are also charged 1% in the conversion)
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:52:30
yes i've had issue with it.  but it was beyond my scope and power to change it, so i dealt with it just like everyone else does.
absolutely I take FIAT as compensation, because my company does not (yet) support paying me in bitcoin, and because I have to pay (read, forced by the government to pay in FIAT) for everything else in FIAT still.
if/when that day no longer exists, i'll take all my pay in bitcoin.

it used to be, that you could get at least the inflation rate by keeping your money in a bank (supposed to be 2% - think it's 4% this year).
Now, in order to get that amount of a return, you must "save" the money in stocks/bonds/mutual funds/etc - which as we learned in 2008, is not a very safe store of value. 
By just "saving" your money in a savings account, you are losing money.
People will always save money somewhere regardless of an inflationary or deflationary currency.  the question is, will their "saved" money go up in value, or down in value.

running a full node means you get the entire blockchain.
You can:
1) stop using bitcoin-qt and switch to multibit or electrum
2) use an online wallet for sending bitcoins
3) use a paper wallet (for receiving to only, not spending) and stop running the full node
I believe "the powers that be" are/were looking into a way to compress the entire blockchain, but I have no idea where they are with that currently.

Their pool is split - there is regular BTC mining and BCC (BCH) mining which is separate from each other.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:24:34
so if the price doesn't hit $30,080 (640% gain), they will be upset with you that they lost money.
people expect the same kinds of returns, but in reality it could take many years or never for the same gains to happen if buying today.
On the last run, so may people I know who bought into bitcoin at 1200 and then sold at 400 when it was going down to 200 - were so turned off by that - that they will never trust bitcoin again.  all they can say is it was the worst investment they did, and they are right.  unless they held for 4 more years.

i think it uses colored coins, so basically a transaction (perhaps a satoshi) would get flagged as the record of that item.  and it doesn't matter what coin that comes from, just that it exists with the colored coin flag set on it.
i don't know 100% how colored coins work, but i think that's the basic premise.

curious why you decided to cash out and pay off a house that has what - 3% or 4% APR instead of paying as you go?
were you worried that the bitcoin price would go down and not be able to cover your mortgage?  or just the freedom of not having that debt over your shoulders?  (you still have to pay the property tax which is still a bit portion of what you paid per month on the mortgage right?)
just curious as to the reason behind paying off a loan that costs 3-4% APR versus keeping it in bitcoin which would make -50 to +1000% a year instead and paying as you go.

0.10.1 was my last version it looks like.  and it wasn't until 0.11.0 where all of a sudden my daily bandwidth was 10gb/day.
so something changed.  but setting activeconnections back to 8 has solved my problem.
is UPNP support new from 0.10.1 to 0.11.0?
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:56:37

Bitcoin is expressed with 8 digits past the decimal place. Ex: 1 BTC = 1.00000000 BTC and so the actual usable units of value is 100,000,000 * 21,000,000 = 2,100,000,000,000,000 units of value.
approximately, and until they go past 8 units of value if needed.

I believe the key here is the "single government agency" - which the Recorder's office is.  Every county's recorder in each state, is it's own "single government agency" for it's own county.  They rarely talk to each other.  This could potentially be a way for multiple offices to talk to each other.
for example, if you get a mortgage in one county, other counties do not know about it (perhaps nobody cares if they do?) and no system talks to any other system.  
this could change that, so that ALL recorders keep the records for each other.

most changes that happen that change the rules that govern the acceptance of blocks - happen when X% (sometimes 75%) of the last X (usually 1000) blocks use the version that supports that change.
sometimes, a change can take months to actually 'go live' after the release of a new version (see v 0.10.0 that recently came out).
so in effect, the new blocks cast the vote as to use a new setting or not.  the new blocks are created by the miners - who should (but not always) use the most current version.
at some point, usually 95% of the last 1000 blocks, the new rules are required for acceptance of a block.
This works - because one of the most basic rules of bitcoin, is that the longest chain is assumed to be the correct one.  so when the most blocks are generated on the same chain (laymen could be version), that one is assumed to be the correct one.

I agree with you, the more I learn about Bitcoin, the more I hate the traditional banking system.  
Rather - I always disliked it, but when all you have is that - you don't really complain.  when obvious flaws are brought to the forefront, you notice them that much more.
Granted - some things I miss about Bitcoin
for instance - i recently stayed at a hotel who charged me when I got there which was supposed to be a hold, and after 3 weeks still have not returned it since they put it through as a charge - a simple call to the bank has them now working on it and I won't be liable for it once it's settled.
however - in bitcoin, i never would have authorized the hold to begin with so they never would have had the ability to charge me without my knowledge, so i guess there's that too hehe

if the value of the USD plummets, the conversion rate would just grow with its value.  ex: if 10$ is worth the equivalent of 1$ today, the exchange rate would just go up ten fold.  i see no issues with this except that people will flock to a currency that is not inflating in value, so this would be a good thing.

i'm sure there will be colored or alt coins that accomplish this "off" bitcoin yes.  but they can and should solve the fraud problem at the core of it.
Fraud exists because credit cards are simply insecure and not created for the use they are being used for.  The bitcoin PROTOCOL solves this, and i'm sure future "credit" vendors will use this protocol to solve that problem.

You and everyone else, but to understand the process, you'll need to look at some of these things:
Basically do a google search for "bitcoin difficulty" and you'll find a lot of info about it.
But the idea is, that there are a LOT of "miners" out there who are confirming the transactions (Think i read something like 200+ times the computing speed of the fastest super computers combined) and that was a month ago.  So the odds of finding a block by yourself unless you invest millions into it, are small.
The block reward is the process at which the coins get put into circulation.  This reward is halved every 4 years until the final coin is given out in the year 2140.
Also included in the block reward, is the "mining" fee or transaction fee (google this one as well on how it works specifically).

mining.  same as today.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:10:53
Lets say he mined for about a year, mostly by himself.
If each block is found every 10 minutes, that's roughly 144 found blocks per day right (1440 minutes / 10).  
At a block reward of 50 per found block.  If he found every block for a year, that would be 2,628,000 coins in the first year.
Now, i don't know what percentage of the blocks he found over that first year, but i'd say even if he found half of them over a 2 year period (2009 - 2010) that would give him more than 1M coins.
This is guessing on my part, and should not be used as fact.  simply pointing out how it's possible.
it's unlikely he consolidated all of the rewarded coins into single addresses.
More likely, they are still in the 50 coin rewards for that timeframe.   If you do a search for addresses with 50 coins in them, over the periods of 2009 to late 2010 (or whenever he stopped) that were relayed by known ip addresses he used you would then be able to figure out approximately how many he has.
Pretty sure people have already done this, and have concluded that he has approximately 1M+ coins still.

they keep enough onhand to handle day-to-day buys/withdrawls.  when that amount gets low, they are alerted to go and get more.  There is an interview video around somewhere with the CEO of coinbase who explains it.
it's no different than how a bank works, or anything else that holds things for people.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:47:48
I can agree with this as well.  For a small outfit, it's as simple as adding a button to the website (and then figuring out how to process orders from the list of new orders).  And for a large place like Amazon, Newegg, etc there are more steps involved.
BUT ... if you could save 2% or more on every transaction ... that number far exceeds any amount of work involved in setting this up I would think.  a small place that does $1000/mo in credit cards could save up to $200 or more a month (assuming all the volume came via Bitcoin - perhaps a few years or more away).  But a major retailer doing millions a month ... to me, this is a no brainer.  
But maybe that's why I've been buying bitcoins for a while now.

it does not (yet).  I'm specifically talking about if you use a credit card for getting money from the end-consumer.  if 99% of your business is not credit card, this is not relevant to you at all, and until the other side of your payment system accepts another payment method, you are stuck with big banks to accomplish this.

You definitely need a day to talk about wallet security.  
Things like Two-Factor-Authentication (2fa), online vs. offline wallets, paper-wallets, cold storage, etc.
The worst thing that can happen to someone, is to get their bitcoin 'stolen' because they did not use a secure enough password, or left their coins in an online wallet that gets compromised in some way.
This is going to be one of the major hurdles for mass adoption.

I think you are still missing this ... you don't HAVE to maintain bitcoins with a balance.  you would get PAID IN CASH DEPOSITED TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT and so all you would manage is the fiat USD.  but if you use this over a credit card, you'll get about 2% more of it deposited to your account.
I believe this is why merchants don't do this, you think you HAVE to keep your bitcoins and use them instead of cash.  This is incorrect, and is exactly what this post was attempting to educate you on.

so people would need to trust you to hold the payment (and then release it) on both sides - something that can happen, but takes time.
also, it's unlikely that people would confirm they received the package, altho you could track the package (if the seller provides tracking information) - altho this does not settle disputes like "not like advertised, broken on arrival, etc"
and of course, if eBay actually accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment, you are going to have a very large and very trusted platform to compete with (altho, if done well, you could easily beat them out in this).

This was the major issues with bitcoin early on.  It was weeks to get the ability to "buy" a coin - and usually it involved sending your drivers licence photo to places like MtGox and that's scary. 
this is the start of something (think, internet in the early 80's) and over the next few years, you'll see more and more ways of doing this easier and easier.
Think how radical a "Debit" card was just 10 years ago and how nobody wanted to get one because "it's tied to my bank account!!".
what's important, is the technology behind bitcoin and what it can be in the future when smart people/companies open up the ability to make this useful for the masses.

most likely the same way.  Lenders will give out coins based on credit history and get those coins paid back with interest.
There are already a few websites that do this with bitcoin.
I'm sure there will be more, and someone will figure out an ecosystem around it that doesn't involve "bailout" techniques.
or, just get a loan with FIAT and as the value of the FIAT decreases and your bitcoin increases, pay it off.

with video cards, possibly not a lot of traffic.  Our ASIC blades transfer something like 70-80 gigs of traffic daily to the proxy internally (100GH/sec), but outbound from the proxy only transfers 100 megs or so.
The proxy would be setup internally, it's what would do the relay of data between the pool and the internal workers.
still, it should not matter that you have multiple workers as long as they all submit the data.  You cannot have the same worker on multiple computers - the pool won't know what to send/accept properly and you'd see the behavior you say you are having.
if adding a second worker causes the other to go down, and the workers are different - that sounds like an internal issue where traffic is being blocked for some reason by the firewall.

@_date: 2013-12-23 18:10:30
it doesn't actually.  theft of keys would exist, but fraud (using an address that you do not have a private key for) is impossible.  and since the private key is only used to sign a transaction and not actually transmitted, no organization will ever have access to it just because you paid for something there.
fraud in the current sense we know, exists because anyone who has your credit card info, bank routing numbers, etc can make charges on your accounts without your knowledge.  in "magic bitcoin land" this is impossible.  Charges can only be sent with the private key, that only you have and that key is NEVER sent to a payment vendor.

but that's not the case at all.  If you just took bitcoins only and never took cash, then yes.
But for 1% + $0.15 percent (look at what your credit card charges you to do this currently, you might be shocked) ... you are still getting USD for your goods the same as you always have been.
of course, if you chose to just keep the bitcoins instead, you would be charged 0% in transaction fees.
I think you missed this point...

Agreed, and if someone wanted to spend upwards of $400M dollars (plus operating costs) to accomplish that.  they could.

The first miner to provide the proof gets the 25 btc reward (typically, this is someone in a POOL who finds it, in which case, the pool splits the find among the contributers of the shift)
If you are a solo miner, then yes, you get that reward all to yourself.  Solo mining would require a multi-million dollar investment at this point to beat the rest of the network out in finding blocks at this point.  However, early mining was done completely solo.
If you mine solo (outside of the pool) then every time the rest of the network finds a block, you must start over yourself.  so the odds of finding a block by yourself are slim, unless you have the power to have upwards of 10% of the network (which would mean about 700,000 GH at about $6000 per 100GH = about $42M in equipment) - what's your ROI on that one?
The reward is halved every 4 years (originally, 50 btc, now 25btc, in 3 years, 12.5 btc etc) until the last reward will be given out in the year 2140.
The reward also includes the miners fee (transaction fee) and the miner gets that as well. - At some point in the future (10-30 years), the miners fee should outweigh the block reward (assuming adoption of the system).
Take a look at pooled mining and how it works for a quick overview.  (altho this is more than a year old for info, a lot of pools use PPLNS - Pay Per Last N Shares - where N is split out into shifts (usually 10) - so you are paid on your contribution shares per shift (which the length of the shift increases with the difficulty of the network))
The majority of miners, are in pools and share the reward with everyone who contributed.

look here: 
Relevant piece:
As a merchant, you never need to hold bitcoin or expose yourself to any exchange rate risk if you don't want to.
Most merchant set prices in their local currency and get paid in their local currency. For this "instant exchange" service we charge 1% plus $0.15 to convert the bitcoin you receive into your local currency (the same price if you manually sell bitcoin).
If you wish to get paid in and keep bitcoin, this is completely free.
How do "instant exchanges" work?
When you enable "instant exchanges", bitcoin you receive for merchant orders will no longer be sent to your Coinbase wallet. Instead they will be sent directly to Coinbase and exchanged, ensuring that you get the the exact local currency price that you set in the merchant tools.
Since orders won't flow to your wallet, you won't see them in your transaction list. You will however, see them on your merchant order page and in your exported order history.
Let's look at an example. Suppose you create a payment button with a USD price of $10, and sell ten orders during the day. Your payout at the end of the day will be for $100 USD, regardless of how the price of bitcoin changed during the day. After deducting our 1% fee (plus $0.15 for the bank transfer) you will receive $98.85 to your bank account.

if it's mining hardware (not running on an existing running computer) - then it uses power.  however, every running computer in the world uses power if it's at load or not (more at load) ... so by this definition, the entire network of the internet and every other running computer on the planet is just wasting power for no gain.
if anything, a computer running something useful, isn't a waste of power at all.

most networks are on redundant power supplies and guarenteed uptime contracts.  the only thing that would stop this, would be the network being too full (too many people on a single pipe) or in the event of a natural disaster which knocks out the lines.
datacenters can run months to years and longer without the incoming power from the "grid" off things like natural gas, diesel, solar, etc.
I'm not going to claim that our power grid, or cell phone tower coverage is by any means perfectly redundant.  but that has nothing to do with bitcoin, and every current currency suffers the same issues with this.

lending and fraud are not the same departments.   i dind't say lending will not exist.  I said the fraud department (fradulent charges) will not exist because you can only spend funds by using the private key.  and if someone has that, they are the owner of the funds (stolen or not) and the funds cannot be returned.
Fraud, in the sense that we know it today, does not exist and therefore all the money spent on a 'fraud department' will not be needed.  (that's not to say, a crime department, theft, etc will not exist)
Lending is not fraud ... altho those terms do tend to go hand in hand in the traditional banking system :)

if you have a "bitcoin credit card" that contains the private key, and it's stolen with funds on it.  that's theft and not fraud, and there is NOTHING you can do about that (there is no reversal of funds)
in the sense of having traditional credit cards using FIAT, that you have backing in bitcoin ... that's not bitcoin's problem, that's the traditional credit cards problem and they'll always have that overhead because their system is not designed to solve that problem.  Bitcoin solves the fraud problem at its core.  so on a 100% bitcoin society, there is no fraud.
fraud will always exist in traditional banking, it's built into the system.  it simply does not exist in bitcoin.

1) use a service like bitpay or coinbase who take the risk for you against double spending (also, look into a bitcoin 51% attack ... NOBODY will attempt to double-spend for a small transaction)
2) blocks are found every 10 minutes on average - there is an order of operations as to including the transaction in the block - increase your miners fee and it'll get confirmed faster.
Credit cards are up to 60 days before a transaction is "confirmed" - meaning, not able to be charged back to the merchant.  how has the world functioned for so long with a 60 day confirmation time?  The same way bitcoin will, except the confirm time is ~10 minutes and not 60 days.

not much.  if a large organization wanted to dump somewhere north of $125M+ into a mining operation, they certainly could and would get 51% of the network.
Their ROI would never happen, especially if they gained that amount of the network and mis-used it, which would collapse the system.
Not to mention, they would have to continually buy to keep up with the "rest" of the network (at about 50% growth in the past 2 months).  So your $125M investment will quickly turn into $200M in 2 months, then $300M the next 2 months, etc.
No company would spend this amount of money with little to no ROI.

there are different thoughts on this.
1) you do not hold the private/public key so you trust that blockchain.info will never be hacked/compromised/etc.  There was a good thread about a week ago on blockchain.info specifically and how it works to say if it's secure or not. - I'll find it and edit this post.
2) the only way to have your own wallet.dat file is to use a client on your computer (bitcoin-qt or multibit or armory) but then YOU are responsible for backing up that wallet file, encrypting it (via the software) and not having your computer compromised. 
3) creating a paper-wallet, where only you (again, perhaps not creating the public/private key from a website, but OFFLINE only) know the public and private keys for this wallet.  You then send the funds to the public key, and only when you are ready to spend, use the private key on the internet.
So I wouldn't say that blockchain.info is 'unsafe' at all.  I have a wallet there, and the benefits and possibility of losing all the coins are low (however, still possible, as we do not know who exactly owns/operates blockchain.info).  We'll just say, it's still a risk, altho a small risk.
And there are ways to get more and more layers of security to minimize that risk.
edit: hopefully your password on blockchain.info was not 'password' or 'mattscoins' or something easily guessable either...
edit2: when you are done (hopefully, never) using your blockchain.info wallet - head over to  and get a new paper wallet setup and printed, then send all your coins to that wallet, and put it in a safe somewhere.  (you can also download the entire website locally and run it totally offline) - this is also a GREAT way to send bitcoin as a gift to non-tech folk, this is my Christmas presents this year to family.

It just puts the trust on the laymen that you actually did destroy the private key.

Like I said, great idea, but not secure enough or trustworthy enough.  There are too many what-if's.  I do hope that over time, you prove this wrong tho.

Lets say, eventually someone can check 100M addresses per second (this is an insanely high number) - it would take them 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,832 seconds to accomplish this - approximately 2780634774.221465 years.

extremely anti-green: mining is basically throwing energy away.
by this thought process, so is every computer that does anything, everywhere in the entire planet.
if it's being used for a purpose, it's useful, and as time goes on, they'll use less and less power for more and more computing.

exactly the point that I think most merchants (who currently do the bulk of their volume via credit cards) need to be educated on.

yep, i just started calling it that and it's hard to change.  kind of like jif vs gif.

you'll run into the same issues that eBay has ...
Make sure you can reverse/refund the amount if the seller does not send the item.
Disputes channel - where the buyer/seller has issues with the transaction - how to reverse it.
just to name two.   clearly, bitcoin transactions are not reversible, so you'd need to either escrow the payments (and release the funds after some milestone has been completed), or provide a 3rd party means to return/send the coins upon receipt of the goods based on some sort of   dispute process.

we'd just use .bit which comes from namecoin, and ditch ICANN entirely.

yep.  i say it something like:
the math process that finds the proof of work that re-validates the entire network on average every ten minutes.  the one to find the proof of work gets a reward and transaction fees.
it's simple, to the point and partially lamen, but opens up questions from there.  what is proof of work, what is this reward, why do they get transaction fees, how does it validate the whole network, why ten minutes...etc etc.

maybe this is why chase is sending me a new debit card due to "a 3rd party claimed your information was lost"

fair enough :)

Have to admit, the banks are masters of keeping people ignorant.

my point was, people find a way.  short term, maybe these things matter, long term... if it's good, and people want it, it will happen.

love it.
"so this is my account number?  this is what i use to spend the bitcoin?"  
not realizing ... you are on the air and it's going to get spent :)
aside from that.  I enjoyed this video.
