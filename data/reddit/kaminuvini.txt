Looking at that video, they require "security questions". So now you have a secure password, 2FA and everything- but you introduce an incredibly weak link by adding security questions. Just get rid of them, they're absolutely terrible for security.

Hi! You should disable SSLv3 (See [here]( because of the  [POODLE]( vulnerability.

Here's a little thing with certain HTML tags, but since it doesn't show back the user input I'm not sure if it can be XSS- either way it does break the layout if you don't come from a referrer:

Would it be possible for me to run a verification-only node? For verifying transaction that occur on the network?
To add on that - is it possible to request verification from a certain node? e.g. as a merchant I could quickly verify a transaction for someone that pays with bitcoins using my store.

Sorry, but 100% secure? I had a look for 2 minutes, but it's lacking SSL and has at least some dodgy path traversal defenses, e.g.  = normal error,  = connection reset. 
 gives the full path as well.
I like the idea, but it'll need some more security before you can claim it is very secure :)
EDIT: There is apparently an official exploit available for this opencart version. Haven't tested it but it will probably work. Won't link it but you can easily find it.

EDIT: You can also do the following to simply redirect the .org to .com:
`if (window.location.hostname.toLowerCase().indexOf("bitcoinfeedback.org") != -1) { window.location.replace(" }`

I got a gift URL - you should have it in your PM now :) have fun

I see both Bit-cards.com and bit-card.com - are you guys the same or 2 different companies? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:05
Hey comboy - I tried to reach you on bitcointalk. Do you have any plans for going open source? I'd love to host a mirror for myself and whoever else is interested if if something goes down:)
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:04:21
Got it. I'll PM you the codes once the payment is processed :)

You should be able to get the real IP - when a user connect to your site through cloudflare the real IP is in the following header: `$_SERVER["HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP"]`

No problem, thanks :)

I'm not too much in the humble bundle - is this the one you need?  ? The $10 dollar one or the $5 dollar one with not all the games in it? :)

Make sure you make a bit for bit clone of the drive. Just "backing up" won't copy deleted files. With linux, you can use the dd command to clone to another disk.
Make sure to try recuva as well.

Will you put the modified code on github? (can be after cracking this one)

Bitstamp said this was only a visual bug on the bitcointalk [thread](  and that the fees are in fact correct during the actual transaction. - however that was 4 days ago. It's annoying though, so I did send in a ticket as well, 4 days is pretty long for them to recalculate fees.

Probably because of their hoster - Hetzner. They suffered (or still are?) a 60Gbit DDoS today.
