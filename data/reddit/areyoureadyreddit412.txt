great. Luckily, my bank was able to stop all transactions between my account and coinbase. So, that gives me time to try to figure this out with them.

thank you

Right, I'm hoping I can stop it before it does go through.

I can't find a contact number or email I'm looking right now

Gotcha. Well the transactions show on my coinbase dashboard. So, I'm assuming they will go through if not deleted or taken care of by coinbase. Right?

yes, I'm admitting it was dumb on my part. But typically, if there is an error message, that tells me that the payment was unsuccessful on any platform. So, I refreshed the page, it still showed there were not transactions pending. So, I tried again. Again, I'm admitting I messed up by trying multiple times. I've learned my lesson on that for sure...

Well it's a little late now. ?!

1.) They didn't take all my money, but have the potential to because of their website error.
2.) I made the title like that because I could explain more in the text box why I was asking for advice and because more people would look to help
3.) No, either it didn't go through, or it's going to go through when it shouldn't because of their error. It's not misleading for that fact.
4.) If you have any common sense at all you would gather this things from my original post, I made it quickly because I was worried about my transactions and looking for advice. You're being overly meticulous but thank you for the feedback of how I should have worded my question.

If, coinbase replies to me, right?
