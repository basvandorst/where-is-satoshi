Thanks for the kind words; my daughter is the biggest motivator for me growing food as well.  Gorillas are a familial species :)

Hmm they might not have it set up for their online orders. I would give em a call; they definitely accept bitcoin in store.

Andreas, I am interested in getting involved.  I work for one of the largest printing company/envelope manufacturers in the world.  I have started an intiative that focuses on this type of activity, along with campus outreach, political letter writing.  GuerrillaBTC has bitcoin stickers, envelopes, distribution all ready in place.  Please send me an email and i can get a quote on materials.  GuerrillaBTC

Thanks for all who participated; It turned out to be a great little social experiment.
A little rundown.   
The spots
1.  Marina Towers/House of Blues bench on the river walk.
2.  Chicago Sun Times Newspaper Box outside of the Sun Times building on Kinzie.
3.  Haymarket Massacre monument on Randolph; this spot was used for protest later in the day, hence the may day significance.
4.  North Ave/Kennedy Expressway.  Highly visable to cars.
5.  Cassava, a cafe in Wrigleyville that accepts Bitcoin.
Two were claimed by experienced bitcoin enthusiasts (Three were found by completely new users.  I was able to assist them in setting up wallets and introducing them to cryptocurrency.  
All who participated seemed to really enjoy.  It would have been nice to get the word out to a larger audience; but there seemed to be some backlash to the idea.  Not sure why, because it was simply GIVING out bitcoin to those willing to play.  
Was it worth it?  Of course!  Spreading bitcoin to new users creates network effect and increases value to ALL peers.
I will have a full recap on BitcoinGorilla.com for those who are interested
Stay tuned for more guerrilla marketing giveaways.

I gave away a chunk of coin yesterday as part of the Chicago May Day scavenger hunt, and was surprised by some of the pessimism surrounding it.  Either way it went well, I was able to introduce cryptocurrency in a fun way to 3 new users and set them up with wallets.  2 more were claimed by experienced bitcoin users.  One of which was at a new cafe that accepts BTC here in Chicago and they seemed to get some positive foot traffic around it.
