Bought in and had 1 btc at 5k, panic sold at the same price. Bought back in and now I only have around half for the same price. Ive learned my lesson.

Zim/Zer is Bitcoin's preferred pronoun.

Why would you wish bad on strangers? You're obviously a shit person and deserve "whatever happened to your parents" to happen to you as well.

Too late. If I sell now. I'll have lost 4k. Which is certainly more than I can afford. The reality that I completely fucked myself it setting in. Just another Boulder adding to the mountain of things going wrong in my life right now. The attractiveness of ending it is getting more and more everyday haha

I'm expecting the same sadly, I k ow realistically I should pull my money out but I am scaaaaared shitless. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:21:44
I'm assume those went through by now. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:52:46
Kind of tired of fucking myself over.  It's becoming habitual at this point.

I'm just hoping to buy more if it goes significantly lower and eventually break even. Bitcoin has just become a huge stressor in my life that I do not need.
