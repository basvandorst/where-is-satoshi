I put half of my net worth in bitcoin and if it stays even or at least matched inflation I’m happy. Rather than keep it in a savings account who give me .01% for my money.

Housing market is likely to have a correction but apartments are typically counter cyclical so it may be a good investment if you can get it cheap... tough choice

Give yourself 10,000 in Monopoly money and trade with it for a week see how it goes.

Venezuela had been taking about it. I'm sure many have already without disclosing it.
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:30:10
No offense, but you can’t afford it right now I’d put nothing more than 10% in. What if it goes down 40% can you still afford rent, utilities, etc?

99% of traders lose their ass and fail in the first few months and that’s trading assets that have some semblance of logic with equities. 
There are so many externalities with bitcoin you will 99.9999 percent lose your ass. 
Try trading on paper for a week with $10,000 in Monopoly money and see how you do.

Oh your comments make a little more sense now. Your cost basis is a little on the high side. Have you considered DCA’ing at some lower levels so that you can actually realize some of these gains? I’m sure it just feels like you’re swimming up stream at this point. It’s easy for people to say just hold when their cost basis is $2000.

Why didn’t you buy it when it was at 7300 a couple days ago?
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:08:07
Assuming you have at least 1BTC If a thousand dollars is making you consider liquidating you have more in the market than you can afford to lose.

It won’t matter in 6 months from now ��

Thank you for saying this it’s all main stream media propaganda. Victim mentality bullshit.
@_date: 2019-10-27 01:40:39
�� true the fact we are going this far down the rabbit hole cracks me up.
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:53:40
It’s definitely not a crash. Another day at the office for BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:05:10
Why not short it right now then to 8400?
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:40:27
Just bought 1 BTC this morning. Was in a couple years ago and got out. I can’t see the price going anywhere but up with the halvening.

I tried this back in 2017 had multiple btc and ended up with far less btc by "timing the market" and thinking I was smarter than I actually am. 
Then again maybe you're a genius and I'm stupid which very well may be ��.

You should do it then. On an unrelated note please buy back in at 12k with the cash you made from this trade.

Just reading the syntax people who use the phrase “to my name” 9/10 in my experience are broke and shouldn’t put their money into speculative assets.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:52:11
No offense, but I think this is the definition of FOMO. welcome to the 1 BTC club and I still think this will look like a great decision six months from now.
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:23:37
This. You destroy all credibility when you write like this.
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:00:40
10% would be a stock market crash I don’t think anyone who knows bitcoin would consider anything less than 30-40% a crash.
@_date: 2019-10-31 16:48:40
9200 is going to look cheap six months from now
