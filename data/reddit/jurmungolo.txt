In this scenario, where bitcoin becomes transparently replaceable with several other decentralised blockchain coins, would it be fair to assume that it follows that if they are transparently replaceable because they are actively used in trade and commerce, then it might be possible that all cryptocurrencies that are used as such may equal out in value as per the highest value of a standard good in a stable economy (I.E. $1 - $2)?
Edit: And as such would set a base dollar amount to be used wherever it is not made illegal by the state; and effectively replace the hold that the USD has on the world?

Lol at people who use coinbase still. Honestly, it is not a real exchange. It is run by GDAX employees and they have already been caught for insider trading.
Use Bitfinex (when they open account sign-ups again) or QuadrigaCX (if you are in Canada).

Hence why Bitcoin (and crypto as a whole) is so volatile right now. The industry has no idea how much a bitcoin is really worth yet.

I have not heard of this, do you have any links I could read?

Thank you
Edit: Yeah after reading even the medium article, I had not realised they had banking pulled from them. I have never needed to go through with banking on Bitfinex as I do all my fiat currency trades over on QuadrigaCX (to sell and actually pull money out) and they seem to be very fast for any banking needs. I pretty much only margin trade on Bitfinex using LTC as collateral, but after seeing this I will be pulling my coin and looking for a new exchange.

I personally trade altcoins on bitfinex and trade for CAD on Quadriga (vis-à-vis Litecoin), it's a little wonky but until LitePay hits the market it's what I have.
Edit: spelling

Well that's just not true. I'm not saying it is being used more than the USD in terrorist circles but all you need it is a laptop with internet. Really not hard to get when you consider terrorists operate hidden in communities more so than the desert cave dweller that the US media portrays. And it is definitely less traceable for certain cryptocurrencies. There's no point in lying.

I'm just wondering if you are basing the 10k figure on something specific (maybe an indicator) or if it's your educated guess at where we would be without the China crack down and JP calling it a fraud.
Edit: and the 2x ceos too

So it's not just me noticing was a bitcoin cash circlejerk.

You don't need to understand how fiat is created at the technical level to understand market trends.

A Utopian myth wrapped in a impossible to coordinate miracle. 
I liked *Fight Club* too but I don't think the debt industry that controls almost every nation on Earth would just submit overnight.

This is going to seem like obvious advise, but learn as much as you can. Inform yourself so that when questions arise on this forum (reddit) or anywhere else, you can properly inform them.

Thank you for this info btw. clearly is a utopian who has never studied revolutions in any respect because he would understand that if an authoritarian regime wants to keep people down with force they will.
