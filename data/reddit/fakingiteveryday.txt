I kind of see a situation where a misunderstanding can lead to loss.
Alice wants to buy 0.1 BTC for $100 with 0.01 collateral.
Bob is willing to sell.
Alice signs a deposit of 0.01 BTC.
Bob signs a deposit of 0.11 BTC.
Alice goes to the bank and discovers that a wire transfer costs $15. She decides to cut her losses and consider the $10 a loss and not go through with the transaction.
This is tragic and Bob has lost 0.11 BTC on Alice's stupidity. But this isn't an attack, because Bob hasn't gotten anything, he's lost $10 because of his stupidity in not investigating the cost of a wire transfer before putting up his collateral.
That is a good point that I would not have considered without the discussion. Something to be wary of.

In that case it makes sense to arbitrate between the cheaper service and the willing buyers on this P2P method, but there's no logical reason to screw the other person. By refusing to release the BTC all you do is cost yourself 0.1 btc and screw the other person in a way that doesn't benefit yourself at all.

Before Alice (buyer) sends the bank transfer, she deposits her collateral and requires proof that Bob (seller) has made his deposit which contains the deposit of both the collateral and the btc being sold.
At this point, that btc is out of Bob's control and he cannot sell it anywhere else, and the collateral for both parties is out of the control of either one of them. They must both be satisfied before any btc can be released to any party. Bob waits until he gets his wire transfer, then signs his part of the withdrawl transaction, and Alice signs hers. Only when both sign the withdrawl transaction can anybody get any BTC, that gives Bob back his collateral and gives Alice her purchased bitcoin, as well as her own collateral.

I still don't see where opportunity for a scam is.
Alice is willing to buy 0.1 BTC for $100 with a 0.01 collateral.
Eve want's to scam Alice. It costs Alice $15 to wire the money to Eve.
Alice signs her deposit transaction for 0.01 BTC.
Eve signs her deposit transaction for 0.11 BTC.
Alice wires $100 to Eve and signs her side of the withdrawl transaction.
Eve receives the $100.
At this point Eve has the $100. She could walk away and have made $5 on the cost of a wire transfer, granted. But at this point, all she can do is punish Alice to no benefit and to Eve's detriment. If Eve signs the withdrawl transaction, Alice gets 0.11 BTC and Eve gets 0.1BTC. Or she can not sign the transaction and those coins are lost forever. Alice is pissed, and Eve only profits $5 when by choosing not to screw Alice she could profit $15.
There is no scam that benefits Eve.

I was just going to say that this isn't possible, but discovered it actually is, though not quite the way you say. The name of the apk doesn't really matter. Android does attempt to protect the user from impersonating apps because once you have installed an app package name like com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup, any apk attempting to upgrade com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup must be signed by the same developer.
Unfortunately the superuse app does not display the package name anywhere, it only displays the application label "Titanium Backup" which can be duplicated.
A really nefarious app could even wait for the real titanium backup to run before requesting root access with the same application label. The user would be expecting a root request and there'd be no way for the user to know that the package requesting root isn't legit.

Maybe that's why Bob is asking for $1000 / btc when a more established exchange only wants $900. Also chargebacks are usually issues with credit cards. I don't think wire transfers are so easily charged back. Alternatives could also involve sending money orders. This method could even work for cash transfers with localbitcoins.

No, I don't. People can have secrets, and people can sell services and information. And people can enter into contracts to keep information secret.
But you cannot *own* information, or anything that is non-scarce.
For example, I can write some software, keep it secret, and sell it to you with a contractual condition that you will not resell it or share it. If you break that contract you are liable to me for damages. However, someone else who downloads that data who never entered any contract with me isn't liable. Information is infinitely reproducible and intangible and once it's out there I don't control it anymore.
Just like I can't force people to ignore a competitor and only visit my restaurant, I can't force people to pay me for information that is available all over the place.

For a laywer, you suck at reading.
And I'm not trying to interpret the US's unjust IP law. I'm arguing that IP law is itself wrong and that a rational view of property doesn't include ideas.
@_date: 2015-09-26 12:36:44


Yes, and it's information that is 100% in the open and owned by nobody. If it was any other way it wouldn't work.


Sort of. That's a convent way of talking about it, but not entirely accurate. At best, a believer in IP could say they own a private key. Due to everyone who agrees to run similar software, that private key allows you to do certain things on the blockchain, but you don't own bitcoins because bitcoins are not things, or even bits of information to own. The key pairs and ledger are the only pieces of information that actually exist. And the ledger certainly isn't owned by anyone. But the fact is you can't own a private key either. 
One of the empowering features of bitcoin is it frees us from having to rely on a bank or government to be the final arbitrator of a dispute of ownership, because such disputes are handled automatically by everyone participating in the blockchain. This also means that you don't get the projection of intellectual property. If your wallet gets hacked, you don't get to go to government and ask that they use the DMCA to suppress the use of your private key. By shutting government out of the arbitration process, we're back to an environment where the only laws are natural ones and where something that is infinitely reproducible (like a private key, or a video file) is not property.
Yes I'm familiar with subrogation. If the person you're liable to would like to go after someone who attacked you, you can allow that. But the concept of "illegal ownership of my ware" isn't a legitimate one and doesn't enter into it. At best they can go after the first hacker for trespassing (I don't necessarily agree that hacking is trespassing, but I'll leave that out for sake of argument, cause it is a claim that can be made independent of IP.) 


Perhaps, if you made sure that your software comes with a contract that you can prove everyone using it agreed to, you might have a case. However, if the hacker modified the software to remove any EULA or other contract before distributing it on torrents, then the recievers of the software did not agree to any license, and never saw any license. These people have no relationship with you, contractual or otherwise.


The law says bitcoin isn't money. Guess it's not real. Time to shut it down guys, the lawyer says so. 
I'll also refer you to Stephen Kinsella, an IP lawyer who also understands the issues very well and who's writings have most influenced my conclusions on IP.

Imagine you spent hundreds of thousands of dollars building a beautiful fine dining restaurant in a town that had none. Being the only one in town you project that you will easily make $10 million dollars in the first 2 years.
But then you find that a multinational built their own restaurant right across the street from yours and undercut your prices. Because of this you were deprived of $10m.
Did the competitor steal from you? No, because until they put it into your hands, you don't own your potential customers money. You're betting that you can convince them to give it to you in exchange for something, but if they choose not to, you've lost a bet, you haven't been robbed because you never owned what you're claiming to have been robbed of. You don't have a right to customers or a right to have a monopoly over a product or piece of information.
Now maybe there was some sort of trespass that occurred during the hack in your example, but it's not stealing.
I'm arguing that it's not stealing, I did not say anything about whether it's right or wrong. Some people think it's wrong for Wal-Mart to move in and undercut competitors. Whether or not it's wrong, Wal-mart is not stealing customers, because customers don't belong to one business or another.

You don't even need automatic backups. You just need to backup your private key once. The private key is the wallet, everything else is stored on the network. The bitcoins themselves don't exist in the wallet, they exist as a record of transactions which can be then transfered elsewhere with the private key. There is nothing to backup but the key and it only needs to be done once.

If walmart started accepting bitcoin today, they wouldn't get anywhere near 10 billion in sales in bitcoin (much less 10%, which would be over 40 billion).
Sales would start low and prices would be set to USD, though transactions may occor in bitcoin. Because of this increased utility (the ability to spend at walmart), the demand for bitcoin would increase satisfying the need of walmart to sell the bitcoin back for USD to pay expenditures. This would happen at a gradual pace and be self correcting. If walmart has too many bitcoin to sell, they drive the price of bitcoin down, which causes the price of items sold in bitcoin to rise, reducing the amount of bitcoin they take in as revenue resulting in a shortage of bitcoin available on the market and causing the price to rise again.

One can buy or earn and spend bitcoin without understanding anything about hashrates, difficulty or mining.
However, if someone wants to make an intelligent statement about inflation or the stability of a fiat currency, they must understand significantly more about financial markets.

So is the limitation that gold can't be exchanged with iron in equal measure by weight. This limit is imposed because there is less gold than iron.
Similarly for this particular mathematical formula, there are limited numbers of solutions. Sure another formula could be used, just like another element than gold could be used. It's self imposed because it's rarity makes it stable.
You can analogously compare different mathematical formulas to different elements. They are each unique and have different properties. The particular formula used for bitcoin has similar properties to gold in being easily divisible and limited in quantity.


Your analogy breaks down because there is one central authority who compels others to follow. Nobody compels the nodes to upgrade to the latest code. In fact, if you look, most of them haven't. They do so entirely voluntarily and only if they feel the changes make the system better. Further, everyone on the network cooperates in this voting process. And even better than voting democratically, if some participants don't like it, they can fork the block chain and run their own. I can't decide that I don't like the direction of US dollars so I'm going to fork it, recognizing federal reserve notes printed before 2012, but only notes printed by my mint after that.


And bitcoin has value because no more can be mined by the laws of mathematics. Sure, other formulas can create different amounts, but that's as irrelevant of saying that we can mine more iron. It has no effect on the unique formula that is used to find bitcoins.


For bitcoin, those rules were invented (or discovered, see philosophy note above) by one person. But now that they are out, no one person can modify them. It takes a proposal and a process of acceptance from clients, which has proven very difficult to do. See  and notice that even if there's a problem, the best that can be done is to politely ask participants to help fix it. There's no way to enforce it.

That's still not a problem. If someone storing their value in bitcoins suddenly needs to dip into savings, even if they intend to do the spending with USD they must first buy the USD with bitcoins. This is spending, even if it's not spending directly on goods or services.
The idea that the economies would be so separate would only apply if an individual only held bitcoins or fiat, but since most holders of bitcoins have both, there is still spending and purchasing going on in the bitcoin economy, even if most of that purchasing is of other currencies right now.
Those who are well off and don't need to dip into savings are selling fiat for bitconis to hold in savings to not be spent in the forseeable future. Doing this they take bitcoins out of circulation and increase the value of the bitcoins for those who will need to purchase fiat with them when they fall on hard times.
This rewarding of savings is good for all involved.

Loans have existed in gold for a long time. But they will be different. The situation in this post is implausible. First of all, the lender may have a claim to said interest, but since he has no means to go to court and have it seized, he will only be willing to lend to those he would trust to repay. This would significant impact his ability to loan his money 100% of the time.
Further, as he collects more of the money supply, he must either spend it or hoard it. If he spends it, it goes into the hands of another not on loan and decreases his control. If he hoards it, then the comparative value or buying power of everyone else's bitcoin goes up because he has essentially deflated the currency. This encourages savings and discourages lending, which again impacts his ability to lend and make more money.
This balance is only possible because he's not the only greedy guy on the block, other people are greedy as well, and these competing interests lend stability and checks and balances to the economy.
Hell the greedy interest in not having the currency we're holding debased by government is the reason many are involved in bitcoin at all.

Wow, I have to say this is unsettling to me that electrum uses /dev/urandom. An offline computer with no storage, as many advocate for paper wallet generation, would be particularly vulnerable since it has few sources for entropy.
Edit: I'm guessing they do this because os.urandom() is available in standard python modules.
Edit2: Electurium uses the following random function:
    random_seed = lambda n: "%032x"%ecdsa.util.randrange( pow(2,n) )
Trying to figure out exactly how that function works.
Edit3: ecdsa.util.randrange does use urandom as the source for initial entropy:
       if entropy is None:
            entropy = os.urandom
I contend that this is a security risk for something as important as master key generation for deterministic wallets.

Bitcoin by nature is entirely public and trackable. It's just not necessarily trackable back to a person's name.
Check out blockchain.info. The blockchain has to store a record of every transaction or the protocol wouldn't work.

The code maintaner can modify this code, but if the majority of notes don't accept the update, it will not be implemented. Similarly, someone can fork the project and if they can convince a majority of the nodes to switch to their code then it happens. It's only centrally managed in the sense that a code maintainer proposes a change, but it's up to the nodes to accept or reject it. In that sense gold could be the same. It's looked for and traded because some people thought it was valuable and proposed exchanging with it as money. Someone else could propose trading with Wampum, and propose what specific type of bead it should be to be used in their system. Those someone's aren't centrally managing the currency, they're proposing an idea and if others like it and want to trade with it, then it works. Same with bitcoin and the code behind it.
Weather it's man made or discovered is a matter of [philosophy]( But for practical uses it can be considered as concrete as any discovered law of physics.
And if you don't like the idea of laws of geography then you can consider the laws of physics that make alchemy impossible which lend value to gold.

I am anarcho-capitalist, but I still see uses for democracy. This type of protocol could be very cool implemented for votes among a stock holders running a company. Instead of an elected board or a CEO, all executive decisions could be done by stockholder votes with some voters representing those who trust them and acting as a more liquid board of directors. I can't say if this would be the best way to run a company, but it'd be cool to see and the market will show if it's effective.

The interesting thing is that with a market with no intervention from governments, this is bound to happen. And I say good. People should take responsibility for determining who to trust and not just assume that government will punish anyone who lies to them. Government, the biggest liars on the planet, aren't fit for the task anyway.

They could. But consider that millions of people already have GPUs for gaming. And anyone else who wants one can buy one on the shelf of a computer store.
Outfiting a GPU farm means you have to buy more GPUs than all those people combined. Instead if an ASIC can outperform a GPU by 100X, then you only need 1 ASIC for each 100 GPUs out there mining today. And if people see you doing this, they can't just go buy an ASIC to combat your share of the network, because you have to be able to finance producing your own chips to get them.

Unplugging from the internet is not very useful. If you have malware doing keylogging or screen recording, it will most likely save it's payload during offline records to be uploaded once you connect again.

My point is your time would be better spend doing any number of things to eliminate the risks in your life that are billions of times more likely. To spend time to reduce this infinitesimal risk is irrational.

Unless I see some blockchain proof, a signed note demonstrating that he is in control of the scammed coins, I don't give any government the benefit of the doubt. If this was a high profile event in China I have no doubts that the government would find and execute someone for the sake of PR, whether or not it's the guilty party.

Bitcoin, by design, limits inflation. People who understand what they're getting into with bitcoin generally believe that inflation is detremental and that deflation of currency which rewards savings is good for the economy as it discourages reckless spending.
In this mindset, hoarding bitcoins is not negative, because it further reduces the monetary supply, simply compounding some of the original intents of the currency in the first place.
Your criticisms are all Keynesian, and if that's the type of economic theory which you subscribe to, then it confuses me why you're interested in bitcoin at all.

The problem is it's difficult to track who paid for their meal. Now you have to ask both your drunk customers who ordered the burger for their public keys so you can tell which one of them actually paid. A qr on the receipt can provide a unique address for each payment and the business can see which bill is paid and which isn't without bothering the customer.

Applebees says their research shows that these result in higher tips because the device suggests a 15 or 20% tip. The customer can change it, but most accept a default option, and most feeling that 15 is not quite enough, bump it up to 20.

They're hoping to sell while it's higher, and buy back when it gets lower, which they expect to happen because of other people doing the same thing.

The bitcoin side could be peer to peer, it's the exchange of fiat currencies that makes it difficult as there's no p2p system of exchange for existing currencies because exchange of fiat requires some level of trust with whom you're exchanging compared to bitcoin which is inherently untrustful.
Ripple attempts to solve this with a web of trust where you only trust people you know, who trust people they know and this hopefully creates a web through which exchanges can flow. We'll have to see if it succeeds.

I think a less condescending reason is fundamental differences of economic theory. The majority of economists are Keynesian, believing that inflation is economically good providing motivation to spend money and drive the economy. They also believe that free agents voluntarily making transactions is bad for the well being of most people, and that we are better off in a managed economy.
They may not feel threatened by it, but honestly believe that a free deflationary economy will bring chaos with nobody spending money and instead hoarding it forever, investment stifled and ruthless capitalism causing a global trade off of quality for cheapness and dominance.
I think this is all wrong, but people do truly believe it.

Don't be overconfident in a solution built on a VPS either. It would be trivially easy for the VPS provider to be logging what IPs incoming connections are coming in from to a specific VPS, especially if they were asked to because illicit activity was seen coming from the IP of the VPS. 
And while this information may be useless if captured from a popular multi-user VPN provider, since you're the only user of your own VPS VPN, that's all the info needed to identify where you're coming from.

Transferring USD requires trust of someone. Bob can just not pay Alice, or chargeback paypal or whatever he used to pay her in K.
Check out ripple, attempts to solve this by creating a web of trust where you only choose individuals you actually trust, then transfers between them and people they trust can create a web where most people should be able to transfer with most everyone else.

You will never have stability against an inflationary currency. What we can hope is that the value will be as steady as gold.

This is a silly conclusion. Basically every tamper evident paper wallet out there is a form of a physical bitcoin, performing the same function in the same method of the Casascius coin. You don't think anyone will ever do that in a form of a round piece of metal again?

They're worth something to somebody. I'm on the lookout for the first coin to implement zerocoin. ANC says they will, but haven't yet. Developing and adding more features is something altcoins can afford to do that BTC can't risk it's stability for.

It would be cool if these tipbots gave you the private key to the address associated with your account. It's not much more secure because they have the private key too and can withdraw your funds, but you are no longer dependent on the service to withdraw the coins if the service goes down.
