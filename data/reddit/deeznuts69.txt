happened to a PC in my office. Quickly figured out that paying $500 worth of bitcoin to decrypt the computer would be much more economical then spending 1-2 restoring and reconfiguring. Paid the bad guys, bad guys restored the files and we went on with our day.

Right, that's why I'm thinking of selling my BTC and buying TSLA...

You can call it dumb for many reasons but it is a valid question. I find both "products" extremely interesting. I have bitcoin, I've owned TSLA at times and I hope to have a real Tesla some day. If you were to guess which would be worth more in 1 year, 1 BTC or 1 share of TSLA what would you choose?

I'm a diehard liberal however while the SR market did make purchasing drugs safer for some I really can't sympathize with a person who created a for profit website that allowed people to easily purchase substances which no doubt led to the deaths of many users and encouraged illegal activities around the world. There are many more important injustices that are worth fighting against.

Playing devils advocate, is there no truth in any of his concerns? All the comments here completely dismiss this article as nonsense, some issues must be valid... Take a step back and try to take open minded view on the issues.

I’m not shocked it reached $9000 however I’m totally shocked how fast it got there. $10,000 in coming.

Sorry to hear, I hope it is resolved quickly. This is why I transfer the funds out of PayPal daily so I don't get caught in lock down.

I probably don't need to tell you guys but always use 2 part authentication, so even if you get tricked they can't get in.
