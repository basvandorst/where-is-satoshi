Quantitative Easing? :/

It doesn't seem as if Bitcoin is too well suited to buying local goods - especially for those who don't like technology. Then again, I guess most have smartphones &amp; the net anyhow.
Many thanks for the info - clears up a few things for me :)

I think the idea goes against the peer to peer nature of bitcoin, and there are a number of reasons for not doing so.
A central database of anything is a security risk as it can be compromised. The same is true of anything online.
If all the wallet addresses (pubic and private keys) were held in one place, the entire system would be made vulnerable. It would also require trusting a third-party, and would give them centralized control.
Also to store bitcoins safely relies on keeping the private key part of the address well away from a computer (see paper wallets).

Yeah. I certainly don't get that.
What's a currency architecture? Would you have any low-jargon links?

Sorry to hear of the loss of your parents at such a young age. You've been landed with heavy responsibilities, and you are acknowledging you failed.
I can't say I know much about trading, but it sounds like you have a gambling problem. "Trading your way out", does *not* sound like a good idea. You say, "I know I can earn this money back" - but you do not know that, you only hope it.
You seem to acknowledge that it was your father's wish that your sister receive half of the money. Can you really live with yourself if you go back on that?
How much more of your sisters money will you risk, before stopping?
You have lost your part of the money, and some of hers too! By what you have said it seems you owe her $50,000, plus the remaining $280,000
If you want to be fair, I think you should own up to your sister. Let her decide what to do with it - where to invest it. She may be pretty pissed off with you, but you never know what might happen.
Your sister has lost her mother, and her father, do you really want her to loose her brother and her inheritance?
Do the difficult thing - the fair thing - talk to her.
