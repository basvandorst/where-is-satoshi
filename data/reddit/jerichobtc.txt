If the mempool problems dont get solved soon, he won’t have to do anything. Even though Bcash would have the same problems w/ if they experienced same capacity Bitcoin currently is handling, it doesn’t matter. People are getting tired. Sentiment is shifting, quick. Worrying...

That is a very irresponsible thing to do. By staying 1:1, you manage the risks. And in this space, risks are everwhere.
It’s not about Ver. It’s not about Wu.
It’s about YOU. (Hey, that rhymes!)

Go ahead and import the private key using a wallet (Electrum)
Dont be scared, it’s not risky. 
Unless you have a keylogger on your computer (not very likely)
You should be safe.

So the second two transactions will get confirmed, with the first one rejected as a double-spend. So all in all it’s all good?
I did this:
Sent 2BTC from legacy —&gt; SW adress
Then from the SW adress containing those 2BTC, I sent 2 TX’s:
0.5BTC —&gt; Bittrex
0.5BTC —&gt; Bittrex
Now the SW adress contains 1BTC.
What will happen to the adress containing the 1BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:26:11

You probably found the private key. Download a Bitcoin wallet (Google Electrum) and import the private key.
The balance will then be shown.
Sorry for your loss. Good luck.
(PS. Do NOT give that key to anyone!)

What is your plan of action if I can ask?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:10:41
I have all my coins on HW wallets, so I control the private keys. I meant more in-depth regarding the split.
I Bought in at 300$, if you were me, would you Hold or do something to be more prepared just in case? 
Regarding selling, I'll probably sell for cash or on LocalBTC. I got that covered for now
I'm just worried the split will drive the price down below 500$. You think thats possible or far-fetched?
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:25:43
Thank you! Really appreciate it.
What could someone like me, a regular user, holding a considerable amount, do to help in this current situation? 
Would running a node help? 
Also, I've read that Blockstream (+Roger) are shady figures because they are funded my people opposing Bitcoin, and as such they might have a agenda of ruining it.
My question then is, surely miners don't want to ruin Bitcoin, too? I mean, if information is available as it is, why do all miners support BU, knowing of the consequences?
What about exchanges? Who do the majority support? And do they have any influence on miners? Is it a good thing to list BTU/BU coins as altcoins? (That's what they are planning to do, right? 
How big would the blocks be with SegWit? 
One more question. Why do REGULAR people support BU too, in that case?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:58:26
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:58:21
Thank you for the reply, appreciate it!
Care to go more in-depth on question 1?
Regarding owning a BTC on both chains.
What, then, are BU coins?
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:35:34
Thank you for the reply! 
The thing I don't understand is this:
If SegWit is the choice of the people - and not miners - why does it have 45% + support at the moment? Why is SegWit lagging behind it?
And wouldn't that second layer mess up Bitcoins original code or will it sit "on top" of the code, leaving it untouched?
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:35:43
Thanks, will do
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:10:33
But what about Moore's law?
We have flashdrives with 2-5TB today. 
Will storage really be a problem in the future? Aswell as internet speeds?
Would it not be bigger to at least double the current blocks -until- LN is ready? 
What is the reasoning behind not wanting 2MB or 4MB temporarily, until better solutions are ready to be rolled out? 
Thanks for your reply! 
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:56:33
The immaturity is striking.
Instead of answering honest questions, 
Personal attacks are resorted to.
I most likely hold 100x what you hold, and have been into Bitcoin for much longer than you. I'm not going anywhere. I have the right to ask questions. If you don't feel like answering, then you go ahead and fuck off. Fucking kids.

What do you mean "shill posts"
These are honest questions I have, if you can't or don't want to answer them, it says more about you than anything or anyone else. I've been into Bitcoin for 4 years now and the situation has never been this bad
If asking questions is shilling, then so be it.

@_date: 2017-08-20 21:56:24
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:22:36
I've been reading about people giving advice regarding transferring all ones BTC to another wallet before claiming BCH (too late for me). Now though I'm a bit worried about the BTC I have stored on my Trezor.
My BCH are emptied out. Never imported my private keys using any other wallet. All was done within Trezor (splitting and sending the BCH to Bittrex)
Could my BTC be compromised in some way? Could my BTC balance get "emptied" in any way? I'm holding a big amount, if there is a risk - even 1% - I'll move them right away.
The thing that calms me is that I've not touched/revealed/imported my private keys any other place, using any other wallet - everything was done through Trezor, from my Trezor to my Trezor. 
Please - Let me know if there is any reason to be concerned.
Thanks!

Kraken Tier 4 verification is the fastest and in my opinion also the most trusted. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:04:37
I thought it would dip way below 100$ considering how people were planning to dump it immediately, plus the fact that it's not supported by many, viewed as a "shitcoin" by many, etc.
It's at 380$ right now - meaning it went UP from the 220$ it were at at the time of the fork. How come? 
How come money are pouring IN to BCH, not OUT of it? 5bn market cap? I don't get it.

Thank you for the answer!
Your last text regarding Bcash, the fee's were high even before the fork though, 
That's what I mean by "situation got worse over time." 
As to why I think it will Take months for things to get better, it's the info I got by users in this sub. "It will take time - give it some time." So I figured that's How things are at the moment

I get this week. I do. I’ll buy that. 
But this is nothing new. They have not been spamming it for months and months on end.
I’d like to know what, and when, a solution to this will get done. I’ve (we’ve) been waiting for LN for months, only to keep hearing ”It’s on the way; only months away now.”
Ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:48:16
I wasn’t and I didn’t, either way, 
That’s irrelevant. Fee’s are too high. Period.
A solution was 18 months away, 18 months ago. This is ridiculous.

Or am I missing something here? 
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:20:49
But that's the thing, it was 300+ on Gox only. Why is there a major price diff on the other exchanges, if it's only Finex having cash issues?

It probably is, didn't know the rest took 1-3%. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:07:04
Why the big differences? It never used to be like this. It could differ - at most - 20USD, and that was extreme. Not 70USD.
What's going on? 
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:42:00
I was thinking (for some reason) that I could buy BTC back for the fiat, at a lower price. Nevermind, I'm stupid. Lol

Fuck me. I knew blockchain analysis was getting better, had no idea it was that much in the clear though. 
What do you suggest? 
ZCoin uses ZeroCoin to ”mint” transactions, meaning it kind of destroys a ZCoin and ”births” a new one in the receivers adress, with no links between the two.
What’s better, XZC or XMR? 
If XMR, would this be sufficient?
BTC  -&gt; XMR -&gt; BTC -&gt; Spend?
Or would this be better?
BTC  -&gt; Tumbler -&gt; XMR -&gt; BTC -&gt; Spend?

Thanks man. Tier 3 ready. 
So, this is how it is done:
1. I log on to mytrezor.com (BCH will be listed there)
2. I transfer BCH from Trezor to my BCH wallet on Kraken.com
3. I sell BCH for BTC. (?)
4. I then withdraw my BTC balance on Kraken to my Trezor.
Correct? 
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:50:36
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:59:50
You're right, you won't be able to spend BCH from Blockchain wallets though, afaik
So you have to go through the whole export/import procedure to spend em 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:31:42
Yeah I was kind of expecting that, we'll be lucky if we have our transactions confirmed in under 24hrs. I'm expecting the price to dump down to double digits too. 
But then again, even if it dips down below 10$, it's still "free money"
I'm thinking of selling 50% right away &amp; 50% after a couple of weeks though. Still thinking about it.
Appreciate the answers, Thanks!

Withdraw your coins ASAP, as far as I know they dont support BCH. Export private keys, then import with wallet that supports it.
Then send to kraken.
If uou dont want to do that, then transfer your BTC to Kraken now. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:34:58
Thanks! So registering on ViaBTC is a must after all. Sucks. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:51:10
You HAVE to get a lawyer if you live in the U.S. If the sum is larger than 500BTC, you need to seriously consider moving temporarily (1 year) to a central/north European country. Declare &amp; tax there.
Then go back to America.
If you however wish to stay where you are,
Make sure to get a lawyer
Pro tip: Declare/tax only 25BTC as a trial run.
If everything goes smoothly, do the rest
You are not required to pay any taxes on Bitcoins you have not deployed.
Good luck
