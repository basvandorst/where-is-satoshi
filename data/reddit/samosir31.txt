Hi Wsu,
Keen to continue our discussion - can you drop me a quick msg when you get a moment. Thanks!

i'll provide hosting but it would be customised for my own use (ie. reflect my personal trading fees etc) so not really appropriate for open source given my personal data will be intertwined.

Thanks i'll check it out

I listed primary/secondary as the secondary ones arent true exchanges, rather they are like a midpoint service with buy/sell margin

Thanks TutorialToast, appreciate the heads up.
However what I'm looking for is basically a live feed to advise me of arbitrage opportunities in my local market (Australia) 
At the moment I have an excel spreadsheet which I copy paste data into - does the job but it would be so much better if i can get something customised so all my data is there to make decisions instantly.
You know anyone who might be able to do this?
Also that site looks cool, do you know if it would support "BTC Markets" (biggest aus exchange)

I'm a hobbyist... i can't afford to pay more unfortunately

No just seeking publicly available info in a condensed format for my own viewing- no trading bot or anything.
If any trading occurs it will be manually done by myself
