But even they know that "just buy a new OS" isn't always an acceptable of possible solution, especially when the OS is tied to specific hardware.


The UK central government has 2.7 million employees. That's less then 5 pounds a workstation. It's not all that eyewatering. Shit, I pay more than that for SA per workstation.


Until you say "the current version of the operating system doesn't run on my hardware"


And I've dealt in getting support for Windows 98 workstations that run control systems on large industrial equpiment. When you call and say "Replacing this super nuclear cutting machine will cost 10 million dollars, or I can give M$ a check for 100k, all of a sudden they find an engineer and fly him out.


So, yeah. I do think they will do anything for a sufficient amount of money. Perhaps you are just thinking less money then I am.

MS will support XP as long as people continue to pay for support.

44 on the Human Development Index isn't saying much.
You did look to see who was rated better then Cuba, right? Like Saudi Arabia, or Bahrain? Both countries known for brutal human rights violations against their own citizens.

I didn't say support would be inexpensive, but I'm sure that if you want to continue using XP and pay for the salary of the support team, Microsoft will support you until the end of time.
You think they say "No" when someone calls with a windows 95/98/ME/2000 problem and a blank check? They are in the business of making money.

No, it might not. But it will prevent him from confiscating it.

Sounds like people have been giving him the benefit of the doubt for a while.

Yeah, and it says that they are willing to make custom contracts.
From Microsoft's "[written policy on support of older products](


Who's to say what the limitations of the custom support contracts are? Do you have a Microsoft source to cite that does?


If I still worked there, I'd scan the invoice for $98 thousand and some-odd change.

Except the hope that more people will give him money in the meantime.

I'd be more impressed if they didn't have to come to Reddit to get the customer service that they should have had from the get go.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:23:39
All these stories of folks using the bitinstant forums, and e-mailing bitinstant customer service, yet they only get support once they complain publicly on Reddit.
Why is bitinstant paying attention to Reddit, but not to their own e-mail support and their own forums?

Please clarify the part of his statement that was untrue.

Did you read the link on the sidebar [How To Buy Bitcoins](
Bit Instant is your best bet IMO. You walk into walmart and hand them cash. It's not rocket science.

No one really knows what **anything** is going to do, other then assumptions we can make based upon past performance / patterns. Historically, bitcoin has risen in value.


Guys with more than just a few bitcoins already have.

How could you say something is "certain" and then claim


@_date: 2013-04-16 20:06:42
That's correct though. The fee is voluntary for amounts over .01 BTC. Amount of time to be accepted into a block is irrelevant to the discussion.

That's just flat-out theft. It's time to leave Gox folks. Once they steal a little from you, it's a whole lot easier to justify stealing more then a little.

What is the reversal time on an ACH transfer? Do you want them to release bitcoins to you while you can still reverse the ACH transfer? 
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:16:19
Accoring to the [wiki at en.bitcoin.it]( a transaction doesn't require fees if all the following are true:
* It is smaller than 10 thousand bytes.
* All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
* Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)
