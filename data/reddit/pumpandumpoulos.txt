About time. I was already starting to worry that this would turn out to be vaporware.

Oh look, this person on reddit (who mostly posts in says that they are very very smart people. I guess everything is okay then, and there's no need to question anything they do are say any longer. They're just so smart.

Gotta join the hype train and pump pump pump pump pump!

Both are premined pump and dumps.

LOL Uphold. They're the worst scammers.

Fuck you trying to double spend. Go use paypal for that.

That's nice. Still, ether tokens are essentially worthless at this point, their only value is caching in on the marketing and hype by transferring them to an exchange.

$150 million worth of DAO holders would disagree with you on that.

It's not Neo &amp; Bee. This time it uses ethereum, so you know it's legit!

Hey thanks for the idea ;)
Now let's hype up all those things that I totally don't have an investment in and that you totally shouldn't buy ether! ..I mean either!

Asking the important questions!

Vitalik said that Ethereum isn't supposed to be used as a currency, so this goes directly against Vitalik's vision. If they're not careful, they might get forked out.

He has a point though. I mean, Ethereum is really nothing but marketing at this point, right? Lots and lots of marketing and hype, and one $150 million failure after they tried to live up to their hype. They clearly demonstrated what marketing can do. That's the one thing Bitcoin should learn from them.
