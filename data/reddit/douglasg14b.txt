I'm paying $0.06 here in Oregon, it's amazing.

It is a bit odd, if you are mining, do you count that as capital gains or regular income?
Do you subtract hardware costs + electricity?

Would one of you guys be able to explain to me the extreme jump in BTC value?

the majority of these memes are coming from all the "new" users. And hardly represent the long-term community.

If they did the difficulty will adjust accordingly.

There should be an equilibrium somewhere, I would hope.

As a new miner, I was going to plop $150 on a BFL jalapeno or $600 on their minirig (since Avalon's prices shot through the roof with batch 3). Would that money be better spent on shares with ASCIminer?

The first site I ever used to mine BTC...

I understand the risks involved with the mining rigs themselves. But I am not familiar with buying shares from a company. 
They look to be ~$72-$75/share. If you are willing to, from your experience/ and knowledge what would the advantages and disadvantages be of buying shares instead of rigs?

Saving them eventually causes hyperdeflation.

All these threads bitching about Mt.GOX right after a thread saying that as soon as any currency starts panic selling you will be lagging behind, which if your own fault for not using multiple exchanges at once.

What are your thoughts on the introduction of ASIC's? I have been mining for years during off-hours with my graphics card, only have a few BTC. The 4.5GH/s $150 rig looks good for me, though the difficulty is probably going to shoot through the roof.

Why push the bubble to the point where bitcoin will fail entirely?
Why not ease it up, and up till it reaches $1,000,000/BTC and is stable there? Why purposely try and ruin it and break its economic value?
Though if this is not a bubble, it will taper off at a stable point once the amount of new people buying BTC levels off.

That's a fairly large statement there, do you have any data to back up your claim that MTGOX was DDOS'd before panic selling? Or that the panic selling is causing it to slow down?
It lets to work the other way, panic selling causes markets to lag. Which has been shown time and time again, and is apparent here since the majority of all other markets started lagging shortly after as well from largest to smallest.

Bitcoin, relatively stable in it's growth until it gained massive attention.
It's price went up in a huge bubble as it's popularity gained. Then suddenly fell because it's price was not anywhere near stable. 
All of this mass media attention is just escalating the problem. You will notice a nice correlation between bitcoins price and it's popularity.  It fell, and now all the people praising it have turned 180 and are now calling it completely useless. Which is fine, it will eventually lose it's attention and fall back to where it should be.
All of this attention simply caused a massive spike in BTC, it did nothing to "derail" the currency.
