Which means it won't happen this year

It's something fun, an artifact to remember that you were around at the start of the revolution
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:28:46
That's the way of the world
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:31:01
CSW?  I agree.
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:56:34
Wouldn't it be easier?  Montero, on the other hand
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:54:15
It will be :)
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:14:10
Where money?
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:07:24
We need better mental health services.

Is this Duck Hunter?
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:36:44
Fair enough.
Oh, and I can't believe I forgot the most obvious one.. Media manipulation of retail investor sentiment, and we've heard the rumors of the various actors behind that :)
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:20:40
Price manipulation is what drives all of this. Ppl only consider manipulation when it's going down.

This is me, totally. I need security in my life.  Once I'm liberated, I'll be buying back into  crypto in orders of magnitude.

Drives the market; up and down.  When the price is going down, or sideways, many people are saying, "it's being manipulated", and it is, in many ways.  When it's going up, they don't really say anything about it, they just take the ride.  There are a few that raise flags about the price being manipulated upward, but they're usually ignored, because who wants to think of the possibility of it not being organic.  If it's not organic, it could be stopped, and none of us want that; we want it to rise.
It started here, and continued 
Prices are artificially pumped and suppressed.  I didn't completely believe what I read/saw/heard about it until I started writing a bot.  The more time I spent looking at charts, the more it became obvious which coins had it the worst (range-bound for long periods, etc).  In traditional markets, just like in crypto, there are market makers, or 'specialists' whose job it is to maintain a price, or drive it up, or drive it down depending on the circumstances.  Couple this with whales (which people are now trying to say don't impact things) and whale pods (two or more big traders getting together to influence a market, some work directly for exchanges), you have manipulation.  Drive down to accumulate (drive selloff), drive up to induce fomo and nudge the market into the stratosphere.  Hell, there's a theory that the December bull run was the result of all of this plus .. eh, I won't go into it, I don't remember the specifics enough to do it justice, and I wouldn't be able to answer questions about it.  Let's just say, I don't disagree that huge money laundering is taking place and alts are being used for it, which are in turn buying btc, then cashed out.
One other thing to consider.  I forget which tycoon said it, but the quote was something like, "we'll tame Bitcoin", and they will.  There are legal means through which it'll be done, I mentioned MM above.  I'm not happy about that, I want to gather wealth so I can break free of the despair of paycheck slavery.  I want the volatility, I want the wild swings from very low to insanely high.  Look at the traditional market, those fuckers think 15% move in one day is earth-shattering.  In crypto, that's Tuesday.
By the way, I hope I'm not sounding shitty, I'm just trying to answer your question.

Does Amazon sell this "apology" you speak of?  
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:01:51
No, dude, don't try to rationalize it.  Do things the 'right' way and you won't be the victim of a scam.
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:16:13
I get the feeling you're on the outside looking in.  This is not an entry point for you, do it the 'right' way, otherwise you're setting yourself up for disappointment.
By the way, what you've just described is a Ponzi scheme/pyramid scheme.  The community will reject and interrupt this as much as they can.  If you make money from it, you're part of a scam taking people's money.  Don't do it.

Lol.  Next year.

Did you watch the video?  I started to disagree based on the title and almost didn't watch, but I did.. and I ended up agreeing.  Visa is concerned.

No, he wasn't.  He just believed in Bitconnect, and was hyped about it.  Craig Grant, or whatever his fucking name was an actual scammer.  Know the diff.

By the way, this is a bull tarp.

It's a trap!
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:47:58
How is that going to work?  The impression I get is that the IRS has it set up where it's impossible to buy, hold onto, and ultimately spend without making ones tax situation very painful.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:44:08
Nope.  Verge.  That's a huge industry.
