i know i have about as much credibility as leah posting this but one of my family friends is a leading health science lecturer at a well known university with certifications in covering speech pathology/Psychology etc 
i got a strange feeling watching this video and i have a bit of a talent for being able to pin point when someone is making shit up.
i just asked what he thought and he says that the woman in this video (leah) is trying to convince herself as much as she is trying to convince us.
also she contradicts herself here from her article.
also WHY THE FUCK WOULD SATOSHI NAKAMOTO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT BITCOIN AT ALL. SATOSHI NAKAMOTO WOULD NOT SAY " I AM NOT DOING BITCOIN ANYMORE OTHER PEOPLE RUN THAT NOW" 
THAT IS A FUCKING CLEAR GIVE AWAY TO A GUY WHO HAS TRYED TO STAY HIDDEN FOR SO LONG.
TBH THIS GUY IS NOT SATOSHI HE IS JUST A) STUPID B) PRETENDING TO BE SATOSHI LOLLLL
REAL SATOSHI WOULD JUST PLAY DUMB. 
AND THE STORY ABOUT THE BROTHER OMFG LOL AS IF THAT HAPPENED FUCK OF

your innocent until you can prove guilt.
otherwise everything i say would be taken as true?
'mustyoshi you eat your dads sperm and your mothers shit.'
naturally you would be inocent of that statment until i could PROOVE it, we dont wait for you to prove against it, the ownership of that claim is mine and mine to backup.

it seems the larger you go the riskier it is but also the quicker you can pay it off. 
once you go past a few million dollars worth of equipment it scales better.. and like the bude below me said bulk ordering!

i cant imagine what it could do over the current protocol...
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:54:25

its likley none of the people mentioned in this thread.
your speculation is almost as dumb as leahs.
for you to narrow down a list of 5 people out of 7 billion based on "people who had knowledge of advance cryptography/networking systems eetcetcetc"

well i may aswell get some coins... tip me someone
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:49:20
meh not really, it dropped 30 dollars the other day in a similar amount of time.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:41:25
why would i make a claim and then try to prove it as being false...
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:55:57
no. adoption.
if adoption stagnated you could have all the fucking time you want and you wouldn't see it increase.
adoption of new users and businesses is what drives it.
maybe you meant time - for new users to jump on though...

@_date: 2014-03-06 17:49:10
you dont need to prove it as false... i will say this one more time since you seem quite slow...
WHEN YOU MAKE A CLAIM, THE CLAIM IS UNTRUE UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT IS TRUE!
"gravity makes me float upwards"
you must explain why you belive this to be true.
it isnt on me to prove to you why it isnt true, it isnt on you to prove it is false and it isnt on me to prove it is false.
once you make a claim with proof or an explanation of truth THAT is when i could counter it and only then.

well almost.. if he has 10 percent he could ALMOST have A billion. and at peak of $1350 he could almost have billionS 
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:21:58
i learnt this the hard way
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:08:04
not exactlly... today the price dropped which meant demand decreased.... i doubt there was like 30% drop in people intrested in botcoin
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:20:15
no fucking shit... probally 25% of bitcoin users have iphones.
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:08:04
why would you have 25 wallets...
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:53:46
i cannot accept that a guy who for the longest time used every means necessary to keep himself anonymous would say to someone he does not know "yeah i created bitcoin". then completely refuse to answer anymore questions?
most counter logical thing to do ever
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:29:14
yes, it can be seen in the blockchain that someone who mined the first block (genesis block) has a substaintial wealth of bitcoin, upwards of 750,000 BTC.
