A footnote at best.

Well charging your cellphone uses energy, so that’s killing the planet as well. Think of the pandas.

I’d consider it any amount you can’t handle having up and vanish on you. Just like for some people $100 is a lot of money, and for others it’s pocket change.

And how many iPhones are out there being charged every day? How many more android phones? Think of all the byproducts and energy used in manufacturing them as well. Should we pass on electric cars? Widespread adoption of those is going to consume an astronomical amount of energy.

Welp, guess I'm moving to SA.

My point isn’t that phones are worse than bitcoin. My point is that saying bitcoin is killing the planet is alarmist garbage. Using energy isn’t inherently bad.

That’s not how economies work.

yep, back in 2011 or so when I spiked from pennies to ~$30 and then crashed back down to a couple bucks I considered throwing $100 at it but decided against it in the end. If I had I'd be sitting on a cool half million. But hindsight is 20/20 and lets be honest, I'd have probably cashed out @ 1k and I'd be kicking myself even more so I'm ok with it.

don't feel bad, earlier this year I got back into the game and own a whopping 0.10BTC. If the value goes to the moon I won't be set for life, but I could buy a new car or something which would be pretty damn sweet.

Because internet memes are apparently good financial advice.
