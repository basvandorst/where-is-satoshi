"There is no timetable yet for Wang to take over the CEO position from Wu and Zhan, who will remain as the company’s co-chairs, one of the people said.
After Wang takes over, Wu and Zhan will move away from the company’s day-to-day business activities but will still make final calls on big decisions, one of the people said. It has been reported that the pair disagreed on certain issues as co-CEOs.
Wu and Zhan, who founded Bitmain in 2013, hold 21 per cent and 37 per cent of the company respectively, according to the IPO prospectus. Under a dual-class share structure, they both have 10-1 voting rights over ordinary shareholders."
