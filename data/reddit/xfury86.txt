Thank you for the input! Even simple answers like this will make my research a lot better!
Electric is def super cheap here, so I've looked into mining.

Hello, recently got into BTC and would love advice on how to day trade, and being up to date with BTC and other crypto.  Also block chain.YouTube and other source would be great
My friend is also looking for a expert in SE Asia that can help him in BTC and other coin trading, any recommendation on where we can look at? He has everything personal finance set up, like emergency funds, retirements, etc and he wants to go full on day trading.
Thank you!

Thank you for your reply! I can see where you're coming from (not 100% but I somewhat understand).
Definitely not trying to do a get rich quick thing, but want a decent investment.

Lucky! I bought about $10 worth when it came out, lost all of it after I formatted my hard drive that I still use to do, recently got back into bitcoin and I'm still sad thinking about it lol

Thank you for this guide! Downloaded Electrum for my PC and Breadwallet for my iOS. If there is better options, please let me know!
Have a few question that I tried to find using the search but it seems old, and would like a more updated answer since a lot can change.
Was looking at the Trezor and Keepkey, which would be best? Or is it more of a personal preference? Wanna make sure my wallet is as secure as possible while, easy to use when needed.
Also, how does one go on tracking or to find out when is the "best" time is to buy? I never done anything like this before, so I do apologized about the dumb questions.
I had a wallet when I first heard about Bitcoin around 2010. But it was on my old computer. But I have the hard drive but it was format multiple times, is there any other way to recover it? Or am I out of luck?
Once again, thank you to the OP and the member of this community!
