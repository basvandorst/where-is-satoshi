it is possible.
If enough costumers throw a fit then banks do actually change policies. 
Bank of America got some of that a while back IRCC.
Also, the alternative is that the network becomes slower as transactions with no meaningful wealth.
The 0.8 vs 0.7 conflict shows that those who run the nodes do not always go with what the client devs say.

They are adding more options, if the majority of the miners decide to set the minimum tax to nothing or the minimum to the same, or both to whatever.

You assume there is no communication going on. That administrator of a node is not a automaton who cannot be asked to change a setting.
If I could buy something with 54.3 micro btc then that is your demand.
I might have to buy that thing in sets of two until the network changes, but it creates demand and thus solves your issue.

This is just a default setting.
Should it come that such minute amounts of coin is worth dealing in then it will be worth taxing and then nodes will want to start logging them.

Unless nodes change that setting because they learn there is a demand for such and thus move to accommodate such.
This just gives node the ability to set a minimum transaction that they are willing to accept which is important because huge numbers of microtransactions take up resources from miners while giving them almost nothing in return.
