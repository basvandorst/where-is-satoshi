Thank you slashdot 2009.

yeah.  IF he really did nothing but sit on them then it should be easy.  30/wk * number weeks = money in, regarless of purchase price.  sale out - money in = profit.

Thank you for proving my point.  I can afford taxes and I like helping people, knowing they'll do the same for me.  You're just a sad hypocrite, sucking at the teat while complaining about the free food.

If you bought it through one exchange you can get the entire transaction log, put it in a spreadsheet, and get the exact answer.  As you’ve crossed multiple years, you may have to file amendments on previous years taxes. Ymmv

Tax is theft only to antisocial people who dream they can do it alone. Based on the way you add insults to your every post, you fit the profile. If only you were sincere! Move to the Yukon, far off the grid, where no one will tax you anything.

AML?  KYC?

well you'd only be getting their side from me, so that's not reliable.  they claim their SWIFT payment process is down and (naturally) they're super sorry and working really hard to get it going again.  Still don't see why a local company can't courrier me a check.

Imagine I care how many clients they have.  I was told 7-10 business days and it has now been a month and my creditors want to get paid.
I didn't find out and immediately overreact-post on I filed a ticket and went through the normal channels.  Channels, I might add, which are now slow to respond and appear to copy/paste formulaic replies that don't address my concerns.
We are agreed on one thing: I really hope it is just a technical glitch that will be resolved soon.  I'd be delighted to delete this post as a... regretful misunderstanding.

Kraken bought out my previous BTC trader so they know my trade history.  They also know the coin history and can (probably) see I mined them myself, so there's no money laundering.

The response to my ticket was "buy back your BTC, we'll give you credits to cover the cost.  credits will appear in two weeks."  So I'm back where I started... except I'm out the margin I'd have made if I kept the BTC for the last month.  I want to be mature and not sour about it, and I guess I see a kind of humor in this... Feeling pretty burned right now.

Forks are great.  I have coins older than the fork.  Can I sell them once on each fork?

If I may be so bold: Can someone add "things that add value to bitcoin" to the daily discussion topics?  It stands to reason that fans of crypto should be bragging to everyone about how it makes everyone's life better, not just "well... I got mine."

Watching confirmations on blockchain and I nearly choked on my drink when I saw this:
