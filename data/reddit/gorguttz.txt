It looks like mastercard is lobbing against Bitcoin.As I stated we need to get together funds to offset mastercard lobbing

I have been looking at this site for a bit and it seems like one of the better ways to invest in bitcoin because you dont need to buy any equipment and depends on the price you get Gh's for,why do you think its a scam?
@_date: 2014-04-29 00:56:18
r/bitcoin should try to raise funds to offset this to hire its own lobbyist,if that stupid f**king doge can get its face on a car we can definitely try to get the bitcoin ecosystem to raise funds to keep the playing field fair

@_date: 2014-08-21 01:05:25
Cool,thx for the great explanation

If your sending BTC to a BTC-e account no,to send USD I believe you need to do a bank wire.

@_date: 2014-02-11 00:41:26
Ok thats some relief,keeping thinkin what if i had gotten $3000 worth under $200;been driving me crazy
@_date: 2016-03-22 07:38:47
But does it mean its a scam or just incompetence?seems like if they were gonna pull an exit scam there would have been better times to have done it
@_date: 2016-03-22 07:59:13
I hope so,i have about 35 btc on the site;idk if hes trying to scam it just sets off my counterparty risk antennas 
@_date: 2016-03-22 06:32:27
It has gone into receivership,i have some btc on the site and did always consider counterparty risk but what are the chances of bettors getting their btc back

It is clear that there's is opportunity for arbitrage,besides a wire transfer how can one get fiat in or out of BTCE?
