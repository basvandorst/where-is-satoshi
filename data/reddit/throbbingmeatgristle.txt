Plot twist: Apple likes that scam wallets give bitcoin a bad rep and don't mind this one bit. 
So over time no one wants to use their iPhones for bitcoin anymore because someone they know lost money or they read something on reddit bad about it so they wont be going there. 
Only safe option presented by Apple would be Apple Pay.

I agree with these conclusions - and that is without reference to maths or economics - it just seems to be so obvious that this is the case.
It is also why I find the reticence of bitcoin's current development to provide methods of achieving proper anonymity a bit surprising. Still there are some promising initiatives in the alt-coin world that will set the bar on that aspect and from there we will see how things develop.

Forget about ID, as far as I know there is no rule that says you have to do KYC for simply renting out computer equipment.
State up front that the facilities that are rented must be used lawfully.
You need to make a set of Terms and Conditions that state you will terminate the service of anyone breaking the law - with a reasonable refund that takes into account the losses you would incur in exercising your right to terminate. The language will need work and you will need to figure out how you would make the judgement.

I used to mine VTC. 
For a while I tried to mine on a p2p node when they had a big push on to do that, and with the carrot of MON initially only being mergemineable on p2pools. I tried many nodes. It was a nightmare of high reject rates each time. I went back to a traditional pool before the power costs overtook the available incentives. Before I switched to X11 for GPU mining I noted that those trad pools offered even better mergemining facilities than the p2pools did. SimpleVert being a good example.
I am sure something like p2pool solves the problem it but only once that technology is smoothed out and the sharechain it depends on is properly secured against abuse; and there needs to be an incentive to use it and not use pools.
No incentive and it wont happen.

If someone has triggered an AML or CTF style investigation on you, no one at the bank is allowed to tell you on pain of big fines and prison time - and individual employees are liable, not just the banks. This will be frustrating but that's the way the laws are.
Keep written notes of what is happening to you and who you are talking to and what is said.
Relax and breathe easy. Be cool and respectful on the phone.
This will be frustrating for you but the bank is not going to steal money from you! They may make your life inconvenient for a while.
I recommend that you do not attempt ideological debate with banks about Bitcoin. It is a product and it has business potential. 
(That said it is quite likely that Bitcoin is a factor that increases the amount of monitoring that you are subject to).
As  you are running a registered business in Australia, you already would have been keeping good records. Review them for high value transactions - how much do you know about the counter-parties? Any transactions over AUD$10,000? The banks have to flag those up to monitoring agencies.

The bank's main duty is to flag suspicion (if that is what happened) - they are reporting entities, and they report you to AUSTRAC - consequently, the regulator may have asked the bank about you on the basis of the $10k transactions - which caused a blip on the radar. I think its the regulator or the task force who can decide what to do in terms of enforcement. The bank can do whatever they like within the terms of the agreement between you. 
You may end up receiving some "guidance" from the regulator... If one of your customers was actually a wrong-un, this may probably mean it gets more complicated.

You don't appear, or perhaps are pretending not to realize that this is the first step on a very slippery slope and the biggest threat to your idea is that almost everyone who is enthusiastic in the freedom bitcoin promises does see it, they see it VERY CLEARLY.

It neither case is it *your* money. You used a line of credit (their money) to pay off a card which loans their money to you.
What is happening is they are telling YOU what you can and cannot do with *their* money.
That is why she cant tell you what to do with your money but she can when it is not yours.

I'm from the UK, been with barclays since the 80's and you were always asked to give notice a day in advance for larger withdrawals. Nothing new here.
What is new is the way you are cross examined on what you need _cash_ for and the general suspicion around anyone wanting lots of it.

They would not be able to do this. THey need to keep secrets, so they would not want a transparent blockchain  so people (even if only other banks) could see what was being done by everyone else on the network.

Yes, but it doesn't need to yet. I expect there will be some administrative charges, these pricks don't work for free.

You must! Also while you are at it, you can remind people that security != anonymity, they are quite different things.
