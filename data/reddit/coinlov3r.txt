why you think that? more than two thirds of my sales so far are throug paypal. i know that paypal's fee of 2% is not really small but what can we do?  
plus this website does not take this 2% but only their fee which is even better than skrill

really? we need opinions and codes here, not spam.
have you tried the service? you are basically accusing because it is new service? me and probably most people here are aware of that, since there was a pre-launch promotion. 
so to be honest your opinion is not needed here until you try the service or you deliver a bonus code. thank you

i did 1 successful trade so that gives me the right to say it is legit. how do you got your right to accuse of scam? have you made a trade there which failed or what?
