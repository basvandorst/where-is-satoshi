For clarity would you mind updating your summary?  We are not affiliated with any particular religious institution.  We are an independent 501(c) 3 and don't want people mislead that we are run by, supported or endorsed by any particular church.  There are other statements that we subjectively disagree with but hopefully people will read our thread and come to their own conclusions.

We don't have limits now... but it took some effort to get there.  As a nonprofit we also enjoy 0% fees there.  Had I known I may have used Coinbase but will still look into it as an option.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:04:50
Put these numbers together based on how much it costs our organization to process various payment types to get the money into the bank based on current fees for nonprofits and a very conservative assumption that it takes about 5 minutes per check to deposit in the bank.

True.. should have said bitpay blocked the Bitcoin transaction.  I wish it was delayed but it was blocked and yes, I guess it is about bitpay not bitcoin.
What I find interesting and hadn't thought about is due to the nature of bitcoin there is no way to contact this person since it was sent without contact info in the bitpay form.  A check or credit card donation you can follow up on but this we can't. I guess it's safe to assume they know their donation didn't go through since bitpay must have never accepted it in the first place.  We certainly get "anonymous" gifts a lot but that's not quiet the same.  A bitcoin anonymous gift is like someone dropping off a bag of cash since it's truly anonymous. Just an interesting additional element to doing bitcoin donations that at least we had not considered.

I trust you'd find us to actually be rather reasonable.  Kaya was founded by Park Street, but we are an independent 501(c)3.  We have a board of directors and actually at this point none of us are Park Street members.  You'd find we are diverse group and the board chair is an ELCA pastor.  You can look up ELCA and I'd trust you'd find a different perspective on many of the issues you express concern over here.
A couple of direct concerns you raise.
* We are a Christian organization and our faith drives everything we do.  I'm sure Sean's Outposts has strong motivations for what he does too.  Our motivations are that we believe that each child was created with dignity and value and our job is to protect that dignity in a loving home environment.
* We never have, never will, proselytize children nor require any faith perspective to receive our services or be in our home.  Period.  Our staff shares their faith (all of them - see below) and we teach our children values and take them to church.  That is not the same as leveraging this to indoctrinate people.  It means what we believe is important to us and worth sharing but what's also important is working together with others who are equally offended that children are left to the streets.
* Our Bolivian staff is diverse and includes Protestants, Catholics, agnostics and people with indigenous beliefs.  Religion is very important in Latin America and children learn it even in public schools.  We are a part of that conversation.  Here is actually a great story of one of our staff members and how the Catholic church has played a part of her life.  [Lucia's Story](
One last interesting piece.  Kaya's church partners often wonder if faith is still involved in what we do.  Supporters who come from a different background get concerned that we are proselytizing children.  We believe we can work out of our faith but still work together to transform the lives of children with staff and supporters from all walks of life.  Maybe we are wrong.  You'd find that many organizations, including YMCA and Habitat for Humanity, also began out of their Christian calling but still effectively work today with people from a variety of backgrounds in their work.

If you really want to do a full workup on Kaya you should read the [Articles of incorporation in Bolivia]( too.  Please include a balanced review of concerns you have and important work Kaya is doing.

If it was only that easy we would probably do just that.  There is very little adoption that happens within Bolivia.  We are not an adoption agency, we are a direct service provider.  Our primary goal, whenever possible, is to reunite children with their families.  That's why we've started programs like Warmi Kaya to help the mothers so children can go home.  Dig into the depths of child trafficking, children living on the streets, young girls in prostitution and children struggle with self actualization.
Your point is taken - we shouldn't use religion in any way - but that is not Kaya.  Many organizations (including major corporations) have no issue supporting us since we do not discriminate based on religion but everyone has different thresholds of what they consider acceptable.  Hopefully you find one you can support.

Absolutely!

Here's a summary we recently did on our transaction costs:[Processing Cost Comparision - Kaya Children]( 
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:57:54
We have a space our children can use for prayer.  It's a portion of a larger facility not a standalone space.  So we do use funds to pay for that and it's also what would be considered a sunk cost. We'd be paying the same amount whether or not that room was a prayer chapel.  The delta wasn't in our cost, it was in the comfort of our staff members daily lives.  I take it you don't agree with our philosophy and that's fine.  For what it's worth there isn't a single purely secular organization in La Paz doing what we do that we are aware of.
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:58:27
That is correct.  The point mostly was to show that there is a divergence of beliefs on a variety of topics even within our own board and that you'd find published ELCA statements that would be very different than those you shared about/from Park Street.  The ELCA does some phenomenal work around the world and while Kaya receives support from ELCA churches we are not an ELCA program, project or organization.  Might be splitting hairs a bit, but the ELCA as an organization has it's own programs but we are not one of them.

That wasn't the intent, so sorry.  Just thought they were awesome.

Likely but not 100% sure of who all might be volunteering with us in Bolivia right now since we get volunteers from all over the word.  We likely have Bolivian staff too who are non-Christians and have for sure in the past.  Just not 100% sure since we don't always ask. We have someone on one of our subcommittees in the US who is also not a Christian.

@_date: 2014-01-22 20:51:21
We are not an adoption agency and even if we were we could not provide preferential treatment for who could adopt the children we serve.  Adoption is fully under the jurisdiction of Bolivian laws and courts.  Granted that may be what our articles of incorporation state when written 13 years ago but they certainly could not supercede local laws.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:58:57
Yeah!  We finally got Bitpay to review or documents and now can receive unlimited funds in bitcoin!  We've also been added to the Bitcoin 100 list and received a generous donation from them.  Kaya needs grassroots support like this to help us in our mission and desperately could use the support this time of the year.  Due to our pending approval we lost a major $7k bitcoin donation.  Hoping they will come back or the community will help fill the gap.
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:31:28
Part of why we take bitcoin.  Anyone else is happy to take a percentage of our donations.  100% of bitcoins comes to us.. pretty awesome.

No doubt that not all charities are equal but this is an article worth reading from the top charity ranking organizations.

LOL... not that kind of block though! We use bitpay to accept donations which is who blocked the transaction.  Solved it going forward, just too bad it happened and there's no way to follow up.
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:31:36
We have it implemented both ways on our site and I know we can collect information with the donation.  I guess I should be more specific.  Unlike many other payment methods bitcoin does allow a completely anonymous transfer of funds.  True, you don't always have to do it that way, but it can be done.  In our case we do it both ways and when someone uses the Bitpay form e-mail is option so then they are just sending it using Bitcoin which is anonymous.  Point being, it's just something to think through and certainly is possible.  In this case we cannot track whoever attempted the donation.  We've since added contact information to the form but it's all optional in our case.
I'm new to bitcoin - feel like I understand some basics but obviously not everything.
@_date: 2014-05-10 01:33:56
Our organization also accepts bitcoins for rhe same reason and have had all positive experiences.  Not a ton of donations but love working with bitcoin, providing tax deduction statements and even have a subatantial matching gift for BTC donations.   [Kayachildren.org/bitcoin10k](
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:36:29
Nonprofit gives us 0% fees - which also took a while but they said they will refund fees.  Looks like limits apply across the board.  This is in their TOS: 
"Merchant Tiers. BitPay imposes daily transaction processing limits on merchants. When you register for a BitPay account, you will be required to select the limit (the Tier) that will apply to your BitPay account, and to provide us with the documentation necessary to qualify for that Tier."
We provided documentation, it just took 6 days instead of "up to 3 days" to approve.
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:55:40
We did contact bitpay and resolved the issue with our limits.   This happened before that and they say it was a failed invoice (above our daily limit) and no way to follow up on it.  I presume that means the transaction never occurred... but unfortunately there's no way to know where it came from.
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:33:18
Come meet one of our children then and help us protect their rights.
Unfortunately the world they have "misinterpreted" selfishness to "exploit others for their own gain" and sadly often those exploited have been young children. Kaya believes in protecting the rights and dignity of these children and giving them opportunity for a life.

FYI - Our homes are at capacity and our offices are not in a place suitable for residential care.  Our houses do have house parents who live there who have sacrificed space for more room for kids.  We also don't just house kids though.  Our homes are designed, much like Boys Town, to be a family environment which means there's a practical limit to how many kids can live in a home and still receive good care.  Caring for kids is so much more than a bed.  If you really want to know why this is so important our founder has an amazing book about his story: [When Invisible Children Sing](

Our experience with Bitcoin has been pretty easy and love the 0 transaction fees.  Honestly wish there were more Bitcoin donations, so much cheaper than other online giving.  Unfortunately, at least for us, accepting Bitcoins was more of a splash than a stream since outside of a small group of people donations have been limited in Bitcoin.  Hope it's different for them.
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:58:57

Sorry - one last comment.  Kaya is by no means the only organization on the Bitcoin100.org list that has a faith foundation to it.  Methodist Hospital, Pan Peru, The Water Project and certainly others on the list would share a number of similarities to Kaya.  Actually the way the Water Project describes "Who We Are" is really fantastic and might provide some good ideas for Kaya on how to improve our clarity around who we are, why we do what we do and how impacts our daily work.

We work with children who often hear that they are worthless and that it's their fault they are on the streets who have suffered abuse at the hands of many.  We've stood between children and the police there to beat them.  We've told them it's not their fault.  A favorite moment is welcoming a child into one of our homes and telling them that this is where they will live, they don't have to earn a bed, clothing, food, school or play.  We love them and we are glad they are with us.  We will pray for them.  We will tell them God loves them and so do we but most importantly we will show them that we love them and care for them.  We will welcome them back when they run away.  We will forgive them when they steal from us.  They will still have a bed, food, clothing and love if they say they hate God or if they say they love God.  We can't tell a child not to be scared, but we can provide safety and protection and that's exactly what we do.
Our organization exists as an expression of our faith (it appears the Water Project exists for the same reason.)  There are and will be differences because of the nature of our organization but we believe in what we do and why we do it and hope to work with others who have the same passion for these children.
There is enough here for people to really evaluate our organization.  There is no intent to start a religious debate but it's important to think through what is helpful/hurtful in our service to children since it's not black and white.  
Would it be better if we told children not to be scared because God doesn't exist?  Or when they ask us why God would want a children to be beaten  to say we don't believe in God?  Or should we ignore their question instead of expressing our faith which is that not within God's will that they are abused?  
There are many theological answers in life, sometimes they are explicit, sometimes implicit.  Zero is just as much of a number as 1 and ignoring a child's questions can often be as much of an answer as actually answering the question.  Everyone should be seek to find an organization that serves those you want to help and one that has a nuanced belief system you can support because when children are involved questions will be asked and they will be answered one way or another.

We are always looking for ways to improve communications too and are reviewing our website already so will look at some of those content pages you mentioned.
As to whether or not we spend money of religious facilities or teachers, it's complicated.  It happens in a variety of ways but we don't have any standalone facilities or dedicated staff for that.  We also work in a culture where public schools teach religion which is a very different culture than the US and many other countries.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:45:09
More specifically limits are:
Tier 1: $1000 USD/Day
Tier 2: $10,000 USD/Day
Tier 3: Unlimited
It's good to know when getting started that they exist and it can take some time to move up to the higher limits.

Transparency is important and we would not lie about who we are.  I don't know that there was any issue with finding out who we are or what we do.  We are even very open about our financials and have all of that available on our website.  A large majority of our funding comes from individuals or foundations with a strong faith component yet we work together with everyone for the common cause of investing deeply in the lives of children we serve.  We receive funding from corporations, individuals, foundations many of whom use the same terms and have no issue with the work we do.
If you've given to us and felt we lied to you to receive your donation please let us know and we can discuss how to fix that.  We want to ensure you are supporting a cause you fully embrace and if that's not Kaya then we want to be sure your support goes where you want.

We use bitpay to accept donations.  By default they only allow $1k/day and block anything above that.  They have a process to increase that limit.  We applied last week and things were finally approved/reviewed and now it's unlimited transactions.  So I know nothing can block a bitcoin transaction but if you're using a service they apparently can.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:25:17
No and if we were it would be within Bolivia and we would just be the agency caring for the child until adoption.  US citizens cannot adopt from Bolivia so as a US organization there is nothing we could do here anyway.

We've actually had a boy's home for many years. Working with girls is much more complex since even at a young age they are far more likely to be involved in prostitution or trafficking. We wanted to first get some experience working with girls and started with our Kaya Center. Now we finally have the resources and experience to help these girls who desperately need a home.

Thanks for considering supporting Kaya. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:11:10
That's insightful. For us we have some individuals within our current donor base who are excited about Kaya and about Bitcoin but the vast majority of our donors are not involved with Bitcoin so really we're reliant largely on new donors giving using Bitcoin. As you say, maybe the current phase of Bitcoin is in won't attract donations based on Bitcoin enthusiasm.
Tax incentives could be powerful, as they are with giving appreciated stock or real estate, however that may not be the case with the Bitcoin community and that benefit would be limited to US taxpayers.
