    1.- own themselves
    2.- do jobs for humans to get money
    3.- pay to another machines or humans for their own energy and repairs
    4.- pay to another machines to replicate themselves
    5.- pay to humans to reprogram to make them more efficient
    6.- goto 2.- until some greedy human programmer made a mistake
    7.- pay another machine to steal, slave and/or kill all humans

Hi, I documented how to install a skyhook from scratch using the latest raspbian and cyanogenmod because there is no official docs about that. Also compiled other stuff for the skyhook like the manuals.
BTW, the lamassu is way better (hw &amp; sw) and now is free software too.

ADs are bad for society. Please. Stop.
Meanwhile, [Adblock plus]( for the main browsers and [AdAway]( for Android should do the trick.

Interesting. I remember when u/muneebali and his Onename team "forked" the id/ (nameID) specification and without any previous debate.
See his response on why they re-invented it:
Now we have 2 competing standards for storing identity information on the Namecoin blockchain. I still prefer id/ because is a community consensus. u/ spec was created by Onename when there was not need to, as they could have reached consensus easily to have their ideas integrated on id/. Of course not the pre-squatting tons of names by themselves idea.

More than silly, is kafkian. How anyone can declare to be an authority all over the world and pretend to be serious?
How a seller that is doing nothing illegal following the local laws can be persecuted?
In my country is perfectly legal to sell bitcoin to anyone, no matter where they come from.

I think it can be better just changing some incorrect answers to be more like the correct one.
Example:  What is Bitcoin?
* a) A peer-to-peer digital gold system
* b) A peer-to-peer electronic gold system
* c) A peer-to-peer electronic cash system
* d) A peer-to-peer digital gold and electronic cash system
And for the level 2, I would start with the same question but with different answers:
* a) A coin and a decentralized ledger
* b) A coin and a distributed ledger
* c) A unit of account and a distributed ledger
* d) A unit of account and a decentralized ledger

If the u/ namespace is no different, then what are the reasons for not using id/?
I love the OpenBazaar and Namecoin projects and this makes me sad.

Nope, just personal preference. I like it because it "intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages". It may remove some packages too.

A mi los de Openbank me hicieron algo parecido al enviar pasta a la cuenta de Bitstamp. Al cabo de una semana, como aún no había llegado la transferencia llamé al banco y me dijeron que había sido bloqueada por motivos de seguridad.
Les dije que quería transferirlo igualmente y tras preguntarme varias veces si estaba seguro lo acabaron haciendo.
Muy mal que no me avisaran, les tuve que llamar yo. Pero al menos acabaron enviando la pasta.

Easy. For most people, the World Wide Web Shopping (WWWS) IS a scam, in that it has no apparent advantage over physical or phone shopping.
Let's look outside this whole WWWS bubble for a second. What purpose does WWWS serve for 99% of the general population? It's very technical, accepted in few places, and a pain to use. In my everyday life, I can buy almost anything I want in person or by phone. Why would I use this alternative method just for the sake of using it?
So yeah, why would the general public bother to even understand WWWS?
