I’ve always wondered this - why does it seem like the majority of accounts commenting on this sub are less than a couple months/weeks old?

Look up a GDAX tutorial on YouTube

How soon did this happen? I transferred BTC to it a couple weeks back. Am I able to create a new wallet and transfer into it from an old one?

In a perfect world we’d have both. I’m HODL’ing currently, but if there’s a way I can use my coins easily for things I’d be more than happy. It isn’t made easy right now...

Is Electrum a Segwit wallet?

fixed - weird; it worked on mobile

I made a purchase yesterday, set it up for recurring payment, and the weekly limit did go down, but I have yet to see any BTC in there. 
I deleted the recurring payment and I have no charge for it on the card I used. No idea what happened.

I just posted about this actually (looking for quickest way to transfer funds without fees) - I transferred from my bank directly into GDAX and currently waiting. It said it’d take about 4 business days. Are there quicker ways to do this?

What’s GDAX’s fee for a wire transfer though? Isn’t it $10?

This account and story were pushed by BitStarz as a positive story to make them look good and want people to give them their bitcoin, I guarantee it.

I just hate these long wait times on funds to transfer on GDAX (see my previous post - currently waiting on my first funds to buy in). How can I avoid fees without hating these fund transfer times on a monthly basis?

So I transferred funds directly from my bank into my gdax account. I know you can buy on their or coinbase and it’ll lock in the rate, but I couldn’t buy without the funds in the USD Wallet. I could’ve done it with a credit card, but I’d rather not get hit with fees. I will look into those wallets!

I feel like using crypto and google products is like bringing beer to an AA meeting

“There’s nothing positive about the price of bitcoin or the direction it’s gone, so let’s just say we learned some stuff”

That’s the exact response I was expecting from someone who [requests rape videos]( on Reddit lol

Are you ever going to transfer money between countries or bring 10k in cash onto a plane?
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:19:56
prove it

You probably wouldn’t shut up about Bitcoin when it was doing really well
