What do you mean went through within 2 days but pending on coinbase for 18 hours?

What about Bitstamp, it is a registered entity in UK and under certain regulation?
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:46:46
My recent deposit to Bitstamp took a whole month for the money to be credited to my Bitstamp account. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:32:11
I registered with them but pending in verification.

I just sent a small amount to Gdax to test, see how it goes. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:31:39
Thanks! I had experience with Coinbase in the past, their customer service sucks. How fast do they process wire transfer deposit?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:39:15
Thanks, so you mean if I only purchase BTC and trade between different cryptocoins but never sold for USD, which means never a USD gain, I do not need to file? And are you sure I do not need to file the holding?

I registered but it won’t allow me to verify my account, says disabled. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:41:31
Well, I have to say it is a bit of surprise, I made a small amount wire deposit last night (processed today) and it showed up in my GDax account around 10:30 this morning, and as soon as I see that I made another bigger wire, and just received notes from them that it showed up in my account. Quite astonishing I must say, given the horrible experience I had with them last Aug. this time, good job. But still need to see how is the withdrawal going.

Any one has more comment on this please, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:08:09
Thanks! But they only accept coin deposit, I am having trouble finding one place to buy coin with fiat. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:42:00
Thank you all! I just use it to store, seldom transfer out, so security is my number one concern. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:59:05
Thanks a lot!

Thanks a lot for your thorough reply, it really helps, so for question 2 I need to report my holding in Bitstamp with amount dated Dec 31, right? And for Ledger Nano’s holding you recommend to report also dated Dec 31, and for GDAX since it is domestic, I do not to report is that correct?
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:41:16
pls advise as well, thanks!

Hi Stop, thanks very much! I am very confused with how to file, appreciate if you can help with my questions. Thank a lot!
1) I read your article on your website, you said uncertain about if need to report gain or loss for transaction between coins, such as BTC/ETH, and according to your replies to others’ post, you confirm now it is required to report them, right?
2) 
2) For the FBAR, it is only for the oversea holding right? So if I have some holdings in GDAX (only purchased, more than $10k, ETH never sold), holdings in Bitstamp (purchased more than $10k and never sold, and it is outside USA), and holdings in Ledger Nano S (transferred from Bitstamp, GDAX and some other platforms, more than $10k, do know it should be deemed as domestic or oversea). Do I need to report the holding amount for each one of the three holdings or only the Bitstamp?
3) If I have transferred from one platform to another address, such as from Bitstamp to Ledger Nano S, not sell, do I need to report gain or loss. For example I purchased one BTC at $3000, transferred it to Ledger Nano S when it is $6000. Does it count as one transaction?
4) If I hold them more than one year and then sell, can I enjoy the long term capital gain with better tax rate instead of short term sell treated as common income? Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:58:12
Ok, so for the coins stored in Ledger Nano S, perhaps it will be better if we do not report and send to our immediate relative to sell and get it back in other means. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:12:47
Thanks but that’s a ridiculous policy. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:57:02
Thanks for the feedback, I read it already and it did not mention any of my question here that’s why I ask. And I asked my CPA as well he is not familiar so I am seeking help from someone who has experience in the past, if you know it and willing to share, I will be appreciated, if not that’s also fine. Communication and helping each other is the point of us being here right? :)

This article is awesome! Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:05:17
For 3 if I send my holding to my mom (foreign citizen and does not have US tax responsibility) will this bypass the tax for me for the gain?
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:39:11
Thank! I heard someone says transfer counts. And appreciate if you could help with other questions as well, thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:03:31
Thanks for your input my friend :)

Thanks for the feedback. I am not sure, but US government and IRS does not treat coins as currency, that’s why we need to pay tax for the transaction between coins, and there is no link from our identity to the address so there is no commonly defined meaning of ownership. I hope it will not tax for transfer because I moved some to my hardware wallet.
