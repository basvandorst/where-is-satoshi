If you pretend to be a wise-ass, try harder. 20x is still on the high side ;)
That's why more and more countries are setting a minimum.

As long as we keep pricing our bitcoin as value in USD we are on the same rope.

The thing is that they are all choosing for another crypto...

What? The EU was in the same boat. Icesave crashed in 2008. And of course Greece, Cyprus and Spain.

So if there is exaggerated news about bitcoin billionaires (with crappy background stories) it's OK, but when there's negative news it's not?
If you are well informed you know there's some smoke over at bitfenix/tether, you know there is wash trading and spoofing nearly EVERY where in cryptoland and you know how to value that information. That knowledge alone might scare a newcomer, but the promise of golden mountains blinds is far too attractive.

Iota claims to be resistant. A very bold claim considering experts in the field of encryption aren't exactly sure what quantum computing will make possible besides the very obvious direct attacks on key pairs.

Because arbitrage happens.

20x is 5%, minimum required in the Eurozone is 1%. 
US uses a tiered system up to 10% these days. 
There are still countries without a liquidity regulation...

False statement. Spoofing can occur on fee exchanges due to the simple fact that the fee of a 1000 transactions outweigh the rise in price. Only one fool has to buy at the 'new price' to cover the transaction costs.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:42:42
Exactly my point. In your isolated case the value of the bitcoins stay the same, nothing happened right? However the costs to acquire such bitcoins rises if one were to purchase them with USD. So far it looks like bitcoin price isn't affected right?
Hell, charts show bitcoin at ATH! (since we price it in BTC/USD)
Now pretend that due to the inflation of USD the price of lambo's (in USD) is also increased proportionally to USD. Now ask yourself: can you buy more lambo's than before? 
Sure it'd be cool to be able to say that your bitcoin is now 1000M USD,  but your buying power didn't increase. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:56:43
If "BTC can be a more stable store of value than USD" is your point than we agree. I was convincing you that BTC (when it holds it value) doesn't rise in buying power when USD inflates. It's just prices with more zero's, but we all know the number of lambo's count.
Small side note: your USD debts are also smaller (:

Chicken and Egg. The fact that something can do something, especially something that we need doing makes us think it's worth something. 
Dog food isn't worth anything in my eyes, until I'm starving. A hex key isn't worth shit (less than a dollar of manufacturing costs), but when I need it to tighten or loosen something...
A 'use' is worth something, the problem is that it's a factor not a sum.

0, 0, nothing until Joe or Sue want's his/her money back :+)

No fractional reserve means that the bank can lend out more than they have in liquid assets. They still need backing by other assets and need to stay solvent (is this a correct translation?).

Redo your latin class ;)

Hold on, you are being very specific, so let me return the favour. Creating money is not the same as increasing the money supply. 
You'd need the FED though to regulate the USD (destroying and printing).
By the way: there are still countries without restrictions on the reserve ratio. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:09:57
Of course, it relates to accepting upon accepting a consensus. At that time though fiat money wasn't just a governments deal, there were plenty of coin lords (guessing this translation ;)).

Gold isn't truly immutable, it reacts with halogens... 
It isn't by any means useless, in fact it's properties made it so a lot of electronics, including your phone and PC, contain gold. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:17:25
Ugh, it's all tied together, but that doesn't mean it depends on each other or need to co-exist.
To put it simple: you can perform reserve banking without creating or destroying cash.
As I was typing this, are you sure you aren't also taking quantitive easing into account?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:57:02
I agree with your point about confusion. Your examples (and the poor quote) don't really line up. 
An IOU is not money. Take your example:
"When I made a loan above, I created money. Specifically, someone gave me $100 for safe keeping. I loaned that $100 out. When I did that, we had two people who had $100." Wrong, you have one person with $100 and one person with an IOU worth $100. For day to day purposes a useless distinction, when talking about banking, especially fractional reserve banking, it makes all the difference.

Fun read, think you can weave 'Float' in? I really miss this in crypto ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:38:23
The backing of currency has nothing to do with reserve banking. 
They also don't create cash out of thin air, they trade for it. That that trade might contain a long lasting credit loan which might not be collectable is where the problems started. There is no reason why this might not happen with bitcoin or any currency in the near future. We already started with margin trading... Tiny steps, but we are more and more mirroring the 'normal' markets.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:37:54
Fiat originates from Latin, where it means "so it shall be". 
It means when two parties agree upon the value of a deal. Fiat money originates from trust in the value of a coin/token (sounds familiar?)
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:23:23
We are saying the exact same thing. Only difference is that I personally don't perceive an IOU as 'money' but as an unfulfilled debt.  Especially true in the case of having tethers ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:08:13
Please reread the wiki. If that doesn't clarify it, please follow accounting 101. Start with the balance sheet, now try to fit deposits and loans in that. Now try to define liquidity. 
What do you think "reserve" means? Now try fractional. Guess what the biggest problem is: depositors walking in and (in sum) demanding more than your reserve.
