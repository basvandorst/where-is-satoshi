Got anything else or are you going to just continue with snide comments and anger at your lack of success?

Government programs most likely.  Seriously, Walmart encourages their employees to get welfare.  It's not like they're exactly thriving though, I'm sure you're doing a lot better.

Well you can get mad all you want.  Fact is, because of your major you'll be able to pay off your debt and live comfortably.  What it sounds like is that you're mad that shit temporarily sucks.  Believe me, it's going to suck a whole lot worse, and permanently, for a lot of people.  Good on you for having a skill.

I'm not really.  I regret not experiencing college at age 18 and I made a lot of mistakes.  I have some snark, yeah, but ultimately it's due to my frustration at the overall situation.  Why shouldn't an art major be financial stable and debt free?  Well, they should, and it's sad that they can't be.  They contribute more to the world than me.

Yes, but I'll get downvoted because school! Despite of course it being the truth.  The world kind of works like reddit.  Despite the fact that you're correct, people will still "downvote" you for deviating from whatever trend they still currently subscribe to. 
I need to be clear, I'm not claiming to be smarter (though I am more financially independent, so it's subjective I guess) than the majority of people in college.  In fact, I'm not terribly book smart and only tried really hard at reading enough to learn tricks of finance and investment.  How unfortunate it is that we live in a society that values money at the extreme expense everything else (yes, even you, and you, and you too...the attitude is ingrained).  Art, science, etc gets lost... "honor's in the dollar kid" etc.  It's sad as hell.
That's why I ask people what they plan on doing their situation.  They usually respond with anger, graduate school, get in debt, have a couple kids and wonder why everything sucks.

Lol you ever plan to escape that?  It's almost like some of you people relish being downtrodden.

There is, you just have to be willing to be unscrupulous.  I'm not denying that...

It's so dependent on the major.  Unless it's something in engineering or finance, well, enjoy your debt.  Please quit the naïveté.
Edit: Really though, I haven't graduated college yet (took a few courses, meh) but instead decided not to have kids and put spare money into investments.  I work a retail job and have close to 200k in investments (and rising now that I have the cash for serious real estate).  If I liquidated my assets (which I obviously won't, yet) ... Well...
How did I do it?  Well firstly, I didn't have kids and secondly I was willing risk what little I could save on educated gambling (stocks and real estate).  Let's be clear, you will not make money simply because you go to school.  That's a a VERY unfortunate myth that's putting a lot of people into debt.  
Am I happy about the situation?  Of course not, but people are too blind to actually realize how things are set up, yet still insist on going into debt for 20+ years and working themselves into the ground.  In the mean time, I'll retire to Hawaii by age 40.
