This is added to your earned income. So if you make 30k a year from your job, and then sell BTC at a profit for 30k within 1 year, your tax obligation will be that you made 60k for the year. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:18:31
Exactly. In my senerio, your job would've probably already withheld taxes on the 30k earned. It's your responsibility to pay the taxes on the 30k profit you earned during the year. By profit, it means you SOLD bitcoin/crypto during 2017 at a profit. Taxes only occur when you sell/exchange bitcoin.

Using a credit card isn't your money. It's the bank's money, and they can chose what they're willing to lend against. For example, you can't buy lotto tickets with a credit card.

If you spend Bitcoin that has appreciated vs your purchase price, you also owe capital gains tax on the amount it appreciated. This is true even if you're spending Bitcoin and not converting back to dollars (assuming you're in the US).

Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The sheer number of charecter combinations possible in private seeds makes it essentially impossible.

15% of the gain in dollar terms. Your example is correct assuming your cost basis is zero.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:15:42
At this point it isn’t practical for small transactions. There is a roadmap to fix that. But you’re missing the point if you think that what gives bitcoin value. Bitcoins value is because it’s trustless, digital and decentralized. Sure, visa is great, 99% of the time, but you still must trust VISA with your personal information and the governments treatment of the US dollar. The recent equafax fiasco and massive quantitative easing policy / bailouts makes fiat less appealing to lots of crypto owners.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:29:43
Gold has often risen during recessions. Additionally, recession bears the risk of the federal reserve printing additional money to stimulate the economy. This removes pressure from the dollar and could increase bitcoins appeal. At the same time, bitcoin seems risky, and investors may flee. Ultimately, it is unknown. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:00:33
It is a TRUSTLESS platform to exchange value. When you think of PayPal, visa, or even banking, you must trust the service provider or underlying currency's government. When you look at Equifax or massive Venezuelan inflation, trust in a single power becomes unappealing. Additionally, bitcoin has more value than other cryptos due to its supreme security, number of network participants, and brand.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:12:41
Your assumption ignores that miners also get paid in block reward. This means if their spamming negatively impacts price, and leads to less demand for bitcoin, they have incentive not to spam. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:42:05
Additionally, what to you mean there are ways to fix the damage it’s done? Has the US government reissued social security numbers? Also, what about bailouts? How has the government fixed that?

Share price in a vacuum means nothing. That’s the point.

In bitcoin you don’t need an exchange to hold your coin. The cryptography of it allows you to be your own bank. You can hold you private key offline and not depend on anybody. Bitcoin can operate entirely without centralized control. That is the point.

He also doesn't invest in gold. Buffett's philosophy is based around generating earnings. He likes to buy securities that work to generate more earnings. No matter how large crypto gets, it will never replace equity and debt, which is fine. A company could potential aim to earn bitcoin instead of fiat if they wish. The notion that crypto will take down wall street is completely incorrect. Yes, it may restructure with its technology, but equity and debt will continue to exist. Buffet says he's ideal position has a holding period of forever. Equity seems more likely to continue forever than crypto, although I think they both will.

You’re equating a product to a currency. Hopefully this is a dull joke, for you sake. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:54:57
You’re comparing two different things. The supply of dollars increases much faster than the supply of bitcoin. The reason inflation is only 2 percent is because the economy expands. 
Currently, the M2 money supply has increased by around 6% in the last year.

Additionally to sales tax, I'm wondering if you'll you owe taxes on appreciated BTC when using BTC directly as payment. Ultimately, you had a capital gain. You just skipped the exchange part. I'm betting this is the case.

If you hadn't returned the extra Bitcoin, you'd always carry that with you, wondering of your trustworthiness. Returning it solidified you knowing you are a good person, which is worth FAR more than 3k.

If you really want to short BTC, you’re probably better off shorting the GBTC trust (symbol GBTC) as it carries a huge premium over its underlying bitcoin assets.

To lessen the deficit, government would need to raise taxes, cut spending, or hope that magically the economy explodes and runs a surplus. None of which are likely. This leads to the inevitability of printing money to pay back debts. Greatly accelerated inflation, basically.  
Or, they would default on their debt, which would discredit the US government and USD immediately. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:44:20
The price of bitcoin is determined by both the current supply of bitcoin and current demand of bitcoin. 
If a billionaire suddenly decided he wanted to spend a large chunk of money on bitcoin, the first amount transacted would be around the current price to sellers willing to sell at that price. When the sellers on the other side of the transaction run out of bitcoin to sell him, the billionaire will start buying at a higher price to a new set of sellers that are asking for a higher price. 
Essentially, large selling or buying pressure moves the market.

You absolutely have ownership as a common stockholder. Preferred stock have a higher claim to assets in bankruptcy, but have no voting rights. If you want to own a company, you buy up all the common stock. 
Common stock is NOT a loan. Loans need to be repaid. You never repay stock. Common stock = ownership.

You should continue to diversify. There are PLENTY of risks in bitcoin that could dramatically effect the price. AAPL is definitely solid, however, it can no way match the potential gains of BTC.

“Everyday people don’t use gold bars” 
Yes, and the market cap of gold is still many magnitudes higher than bitcoin. Bitcoin purely being a store of value can continue to drive its price.

If I offered to give 100 dollars today or tomorrow, every rational person would take it today, as they don't know if they'll be alive tomorrow.
In the US, about 40% of people are in credit card debt, around 80% have some form of debt, and only 40% of American's could afford a $1,000 emergency. 
Moody's just cut Italy's debt rating to one notch above junk status. Even if the people aren't stealing from their future, the Government is doing it for them. A deflationary currency makes its easier for Governments to steal from the future as well. Devaluing a currency is the easiest way for governments to spend without taxation. Essentially, it's antidemocratic. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:53:12
To your first point, it's inflationary until the year around the year 2140. 
Additionally, people will still spend money, because they want to live for today. All things equal, people have a natural preference to spend money today verses saving for the future. We don't need a deflationary currency to further incentivize spending.  Just look at credit card debt, people gladly steal from their future for todays benefit. 
I think it would be good to steal less from from the future. More capital would accumulate across all incomes, and there would be less ridiculous amounts of leverage. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:12:51
I've thought about that too. Ultimately, there needs to be incentive for people to spend in a healthy economy. 
Potentially merchants could accept bitcoin payment at a discount as they would prefer a deflationary asset. This could neutralize the decreased spending incentive. The amount of discount will be worked out by market forces. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:56:11
You totally can, as long as you realize you’re essentially gambling. The exact opposite of your scenario would suck. You also should consider tax consequences if you sell. 
Even when BTC hits bottom, there will be people that proclaim it will DEFINITELY go lower, meaning the bottom will not be obvious. Some people believe it will go to zero.  They cray. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:32:53
Still doesn't make sense. If you spend more on energy to mine BTC than just buying BTC, you'll just have less BTC...

Do not only invest in bitcoin. It should only be part of your portfolio, as future is unpredictable. Even if you’re 100% sure bitcoin will replace traditional money, it will not replace stocks/bonds/real estate. They are fundamentally different. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:22:41
You can’t. If it’s on an exchange they hold the keys. Therefore, they have control of the bitcoin.

Have you been right about everything? Of course not. So why paint them in such black and white terms? Are you saying Bill Gates and Buffet did nothing good or advantageous? It’s ok for people hold incorrect opinions. 
Bill gates pioneered the independent software business model.  Buffets 2nd largest equity position is AAPL, hardly peanut brittle. 
Of course they are not perfect, but why the attack on their credentials? 
You know what’s unattractive? Evangelicalness that obviously ignores facts. If the general population senses it, your opinion will be discarded immediately. 
I say this as a die-hard bitcoin fan.

So the iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and ApplePay were copied by Apple? Apples revenue stream has gotten more diversified since the launch of the iPhone... Say what you want, but the only reason Apple continues to make more any company on this planet is due to their continual improvement of their product and service line. It’s NOT peanut brittle, as you’ve suggested. 
Also, interesting to call Gates a “psychopath” as he’s dedicated his life and fortune to philanthropy. 
I’m sorry, but your narrative comes across as extreme and frankly ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 06:05:35
So, if they’re all “gimmicks” why has Apple continually increased sales and diversified revenue? If they truly didn’t provide increased value, customers would switch to competitors. That hasn’t happened. They make more money than any company in the world. Companies don’t outperform all competitors and become the most profitable company in history based on gimmicks. 
So, Gates makes an operating system that takes the majority of the market share. Why do you expect that company to act altruistically? Companies legally have to act what’s best for their shareholders. Every company does that. I’m sorry that you find that offensive, but it’s true beyond Microsoft. If competition isn’t possible the FTC becomes involved, which happened with Microsoft. To pretend this is isolated to Bill Gates and Microsoft is asinine. This is the nature of public companies. 
Microsoft and Apple have provided immense   value to this world. Your position is very lonely.

Interest only occurs when you lend out your money and somebody pays you back plus extra. Banks make loans that are backed by deposits and some of that interest is given back to the account holder. Right now, companies aren't lending out bitcoin, so there is no interest to be gained.

The exchanges are not connected. Each has their own pool of buyers/sellers that lead to a different price equilibrium. People profit on these price differences by selling on the higher exchange and buying on the lower. This is called arbitrage. This generally moves the prices closer together. However, due to transaction costs, there will be some inefficiencies and small price differences will remain. Additionally, the larger the price difference, the faster arbitrage occurs.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:07:52
Banks and investment firms are not the same thing. For example, owning equity in companies can totally be compatible with bitcoin based currency. It's more nuanced than "anything finance related must hate bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:44:00
The issue is the difficulty of wiring fiat. The premium of BTC in those countries can be directly attributed to that. If arbitrage was easy, it would be happening.
