Something similar has been done against alt coins with faster retargets.  Point your hashing power at a coin for an hour.  See difficulty rise after retarget.  Switch to another coin for an hour.  When difficulty drops on the first coin, switch back.  This only really works if you control enough hashing power relative to the total hashing power for a coin.

Doge added nothing but a large community of people who previously weren't involved in the crypto market, which is growing your precious ecosystem.

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

They're probably working on "innovating" their own iCoin.

You have 2 downvotes after 30 minutes.  I'm downvoting because you whined about downvotes.

Yeah it *should* be minuscule, but transactions are by far the largest part of a block.  50,000 bytes are reserved for transactions in a new block while the rest of the block is only 89-97 bytes.  In a race condition when two solutions are propagating across the network at the same time, the one that gets 51% first wins.  The small difference in transmission time between a block that includes 1 transaction and a block that includes many will multiply with each jump and it becomes less minuscule.

That depends on how many passwords they think they need.  Or how they decide that you have given them "all" of the passwords.

It is surprising to me that the fight is coming so quickly.  Shibes don't want to fight.  Shibes just want to play.

And for anyone that's wondering, the price correction has already occurred.

Joke's on you.  I can pay in Doge.
