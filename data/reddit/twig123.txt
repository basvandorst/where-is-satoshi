Came here looking for pool suggestions from other miners... I see the post about BTC's recommendations, but where are YOU actually thinking of moving to? 
I'm only running 3x S1's, so not huge, but BTC Guild has been good to me. I am still averaging 0.01 every 2 days. :-D

Your title suggests that every user that participates will win a free bitcoin... doubt that is the case, but I'll participate.
Heard about bitcoin way back in the CPU mining days and started CPU mining. I remember hearing about the guy paying someone 10k BTC for a pizza, and I thought that was pretty cool!
Well, CPU mining was making my computer room super hot one summer day... and I decided that it just wasn't worth all the heat and noise it was making, so I stopped mining.
Flash forward to the BFL Jalapeño announcement, and I got interested again and pre-ordered one. After 6 months, still no miner was delivered... Luckily I was able to get a refund though.
With the refunded money from BFL, I bought myself a nice AMD video card and started GPU mining for several months, until I got my hands on 6 USB Block Eruptors. Needless to say, the USB miners were quickly outpaced by other ASICs with massive hashing power in comparison.
I limped along the USB miners until I could afford something larger, and ended up settling on 2 ASICMiner Cubes. Those served me well for several months, until one of the fuses decided to melt instead of blow. Waking up at 4am to a house filled with smoke and burning electronic smell was NOT fun, to say the least. I quickly got rid of the Cubes... as I no longer trusted them to be left running in my home.
Somewhere around the BTC=$800 range, I remembered that I started CPU mining way back in the day. My heart started racing, as I knew I still had the computer that I originally started mining on! The old computer was in disarray, needing a new PSU and CPU Fan. I repaired it and frantically searched for a wallet file over the course of the next couple days... 
I mentioned the old computer and trying to find the wallet to my wife, when she said something that made my heart sink... She told me "weren't you having troubles with that computer and had to replace the hard drive?"... It was at that moment that I had sent the drive back for an RMA replacement.
I was in shock for probably about 2 weeks,  over the loss of potentially a life changing amount BTC that was now just gone forever..... 
Once I managed to pull myself back together, I started heavily researching new ASICs to get back into the mining game. I ended up purchasing 3x Antminer S1's and still have them running to this day.
Additionally, during the spike to $1k, I liquidated all of my mined coins (was only slightly more than 1) and ended up buying Christmas gifts for my whole family entirely with Bitcoin! What a great Christmas it was! It was the first year that I felt so entirely fulfilled, knowing I was able to get my family awesome gifts, using only "magic Internet money". 
I'm currently in search of a rack mount miner, as I have the option of a free colo at a datacenter. However, they require the miners to be in a case. (My S1's have open PCB and they say that the visible wires from the external PSU to the miner are "unprofessional" and won't allow it). So, for the time being, my S1's are still sucking power from my home.
A bit lengthy, but that is my Bitcoin story!

Does this make you part of the 1 of 10.5 million club?
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:49:37
I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that it shoots up to $1200 like it did last December! I was able to completely buy all of the gifts for my family with just BTC!

Also, could you enlighten me on what Ethereum is?

[Serious question] What's the deal with the commas to separate dollars and cents? I understand some countries use that format instead, but why is it not used on all numbers then? Ex: The percent or the other numbers shown...
@_date: 2014-11-14 05:12:00
Yeah, I know that it's unlikely... Was just hoping for a repeat of last year ;-)

The video lost me a Master Nodes... Seems to me it's just an easier coin to take offline, just shut down those nodes. (or can anyone run a master node?)

deleted my post, as I realized that my issue was due to my low fee. So, TIL!
Not sure if trolling me on the help getting confirmations or not. Either way, thanks :-D

Nah. Might only need a SMS to register, but requires a photo ID to deposit anything:

What about all of the digital currency that I purchase from my bank every time I make a deposit? The majority of US currency is a digital asset as well.... does that still count? ya gunna tax me again for changing my tangible FIAT currency into digital 1's and 0's when I give it to the bank?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:31:49
Awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-07 01:24:22
How would someone go about cracking these? (like, what apps or whatnot would be used to brute force &amp; test them?) 
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:03:50
Any recommendations on android apps that have push alerts for BTC prices?
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:19:16
Awesome, thanks!

WTH did I just watch?!

... and I still don't have my legit files that were on megaupload from when their servers were seized (and probably never will).
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:00:31
Still no BTC and was within the cut-off... I am disappoint.

Signed up, logged in, downloaded, installed... when/how to we receive the free BTC?
@_date: 2013-10-06 18:32:32
I just transferred BTC from my Coinbase to my local wallet, no issues.
@_date: 2013-09-26 04:49:57
$25k for 500GH/s... at current rates there would be no ROI. Price would have to come down quite a bit to be profitable. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:43:22
Still don't see an option to pay with bitcoin... Do I have to create an account and login to see it? 
@_date: 2013-09-22 21:19:31
Not true, the buyer can [re-flash the firmware]( to a ~8GH/s box and hit ROI next month as it would only be ~$25/GH:  
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:11:40
6hrs, I still don't see anything. Should have still been within your cut-off time...
Edit (11/24): just received my BTC after contacting support.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:55:34
Thank you for the follow up. Will you be expediting shipping on orders? as I placed my order expecting it would be delivered before Christmas... 
@_date: 2013-07-02 18:03:23
No love for logical math... Even if it does take 'two weeks', it would still be more profitable. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 18:37:49
I also got a PayPal refund for my miner, my BFL order still shows 'Processing' though. Maybe they will feel bad and send me a miner too :P
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:28:25
Apparently your item must have *actually* been in stock. I updated the first post with updated info, but basically it sounds like they list items "In Stock" if they are scheduled to be delivered to them... Bad practice if you ask me, because they are not *actually* in their possession.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:04:33
Maybe it is a good thing that Bitcointalk is down... I almost did a group buy for some ASICMINER USBs. Maybe the price will come down to a more acceptable level now that KNCMiner is shipping
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:15:55
"I'm down, I've got the 411, and you are not going out and getting jiggy with some boy, I don't care how dope his ride is. My momma didn't raise no foo'!"
No, but really, I have no clue...
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:04:27
I got them from SilentSonicBoom's Group Buy over at bitcointalk:  
I picked mine up for 1.08BTC/each but they are currently sold out. SSB has more on the way and the next batch of cubes are going for 0.75BTC
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:58:41
The group buy was for .08BTC for the new ASICMINER USBs before the site went down.
I'm not sure of the going price at the moment though, since KNCMiner is shipping now...
What are you letting them go for?
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:04:00
Thanks for the info! I'll have to test it out once I am able to transfer some funds into my wallet! 
@_date: 2013-09-30 19:06:26
Any suggestions for the most profitable pools (or merged mining pools)? I'll be running at ~6GH/s within the next week or 2.
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:49:34
Could you post information needed for ordering? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:46:23
Whelp... that really puts a dent in my ordering my BlueFury and ASICMINER USB sticks :-\
Was waiting for CoinBase to transfer my fiat to BTC, delivered today and now... the forum is down, so I can't place my group buy order :(
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:27:29
Glad to hear that at least some people are getting their orders.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:43:33
Am I missing something? I go to checkout and don't see BTC as a payment option... Only Visa, MC, Amex, PayPal &amp; Google. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:57:46
I finally received my order today. Did you hear anything else on yours? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:13:21
Thank you! I just received my BTC after contacting support! =D

Interesting, even though there appear to only be ~11 caches and none anywhere near my state. I'll have to keep an eye on this though.

When I browse to your site from my Android device, I get the following pertaining to the site's SSL: 
"This certificate is not from a trusted authority"
I see it is issued by COMODO, but just wanted to give you a heads up. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:06:12
Sell 1 jalapeño for $2,400 and you could order 7 more! 5GH/s -&gt; 35GH/s
Then you would be making 0.8BTC a day instead of 0.1BTC... Seems like a no Brainer to me. (but alas I'm mining at a measly 800MH/s waiting for my miner) 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:13:13
Bitcoin is awesome... I must look into how to use/fund an account so I can start trying to tip!
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:26:19
I'm a newer miner, is there a site/chart that you use to track difficulty/btc price? 
(congrats on finally getting your ASIC!)

What is the going rate for the usb miners, now that KNCMiner is starting to ship? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:08:42
Woah, those numbers are way off...
SSB is going to be selling them for 0.75BTC/each over @ bitcointalk... which should ROI (Not by much, but still should):
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:08:20
In stock where?
