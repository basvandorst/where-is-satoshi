You have some cool designs but I think your price point is too high.
$28.99 for 100% cotton that might shrink is too high I'm thinking especially when you add in shipping.
Look on Amazon, there are crypto shirts for $16.99 Prime.

Preach brother. 
I like your stuff 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:24:44
$36 and only accept BTC?  C’mon
These are way better and accept USD too
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:58:59
Nah, you’re fine just might limit some folks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:51:47
Good time for these shirts.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:02:22
Here you go.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:34:23
I like this one better
 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:10:27
Those are great!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:33:51
Nice one!
How about these?  [Bitcoin &gt; USD](
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:02:39
I bought some of these using my coinbase account.  Also accept USD.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:23:49
Those are sweet.  I may have you covered on the shirts.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:26:06
Or this one is similar
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:21:39
Honestly those suck. I mean why is the design in the middle of the shirt?  You need to raise it to at least the chest.

Better be pretty high quality for $40 but agree the white is pretty weak. 
Thought these were cooler. At least more clever.
