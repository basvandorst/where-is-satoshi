I recommend airbitz. Beautifully designed and easy to use. My mom is 63 and even she gets it.

I can see the potential in Bluetooth. It would be a lot more convenient than scanning.

I highly suggest Simple bank. No problems. Little to no fees even for international and no overdraft fees. 
I can withdraw money at ANY ATM or ANY BANK and the fee is only $1.
I can withdraw from outside of the USA for a fee of $2 I believe.
I can go -$1,000 with no overdraft fee even if it takes me 1-3 days to replenish that amount. The only thing is that you will not be able to make another transaction until you've paid off your negative balance.
So far they are friendly and work with both Circle and Coinbase.
Some other +'s you can Block your card if you lose your card. No need to call anyone if your card is lost. You can deactivate your card online. 
You can also change the PIN without calling in.
Sending money to other people is instant except they also must use Simple and is limited to $2,000 per 24 hours.
That's it for now.

Agreed. Anyone who is developing apps around bitcoin should definitely watch this and listen to his advice.

Airbitz is my main hot wallet that I use for everyday stuff. Prior to that was Mycelium.
I've been into bitcoin since 2012 and was always a hardcore advocate of Mycelium. But sometime in 2013 I made the switch and have been using Airbitz ever since.
My mom who is in her 60's uses Airbitz so it is pretty user friendly and easy to use while still being very very secure since it is open source and has things like 2FA and password or PIN locks even for sending if you wanted.
The directory is also a big plus and is well maintained. Highly recommend Airbitz.

Hey there,
We didn't see an email come in, could you double check that it was sent correctly to support There was only 1 other email with a similar issue which we responded to over an hour ago.  If that was you, could you double check your email to see the response?
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:53:04
I'm with Airbitz but the support at Fold App goes directly to Fold. They would have to do the support in your case since only they have access to be able to issue the cards and refunds. I will try my best to help though and go ahead and also notify Fold's team about this since you have not yet heard back from them. I do apologize for that on their behalf.
If you have any other questions let me know.

Can't wait to see what he has to say in few a years.

Good to see Airbitz now has 2FA. It is my main hot wallet so I am very happy to see the new changes!
