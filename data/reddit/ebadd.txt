We'll see within the next four to five months.

Answer my question since, after all, I don't understand how this works, therefore it should be easy peasy for you.


Oooo, naughty, are you a fan of voyeurism or stalking? 'Cause that'd be creepy.

Good luck with those fees and commission.

Or could be the one or a couple of ABCs agencies...

It's stupidly bad.
Just a ”couple of days ago”, it was $20,000. Now, with the recent crash, when it went to $9,000-something, it rose *a bit* again to $10,000. 
A lot of people lost actual money. Those that called bitcoin ”even better than gold” (Steve Wozniak comes into mind), chickened out and sold everything in exchange for actual money. 
It's a goddamn speculative market, it won't be ”the revolution” these religious fanatics made it out to be.

Even the two-faced, who called Bitcoin "even better than gold", were into it just for a hand over fist profit. So much for this "revolutionary" technology... 
Sure, everything about the world now is making money &amp; live comfortably the rest of your life... but why the bullshit(ting)?

Here's a tricky question; now that Bitcoin is at $10k-11k, is it as easy for miners to procure as it was when the price was originally $11k, at the beginning of last month of 2017? Or is it as difficult to mine it as if it surpassed $21k ?

Well, it surely won't help people get into the Fight Club, unless you know someone already in it...

Tbh, Bitcoin got mocked the last couple of months, and with legitimate reasons.

How germanophile can you be, though?!?

 &gt;government is not going to be excluded from crypto. On the contrary, they will demand their slice of the pie, and they are able to get it. There is no point in fighting this.


These are contradictions.


Or they hoard all the existing crypto &amp; perfectionate miniing to become nearly impossible, and they'll regulate the ”crypto”-currencies with no sweat.
