How are you guys so optimistic? I hate to be the Bitcoin-pessimist but all the recent Bitcoin trends over the past year are following 2013 verbatim. I predict Bitcoin will of course recover but it will be a very long time, like 2021 for it to get back to 20K. It doesn’t seem like whales are manipulating the price. With whales, the price of Bitcoin takes a nosedive and Bitcoin has been in steady decline all week. This is not whale-like behavior. All the reason I see to sell and not HODL. And who really knows what the F John McAfee is doing with his Bitcoin? He might be selling more than anybody; we live in a twisted world. I think Bitcoin will fall to $6000 and then stay in the $6-10K range until June where it takes a further nose dive down to $4K. Of course, I’ve been wrong many times before and not the best trader. But, I’m making my basis off 2013 trends which would lead you to believe...lots of decline and stagnancy are ahead.

Haydawg could you be anymore of a callous asshole? This isn't funny dude. The guy lost his brother at the age of 29. It's different if he got to splurge and raise a family to the age of 70 and then kill myself. The guy barely got to live his life too consumed with Bitcoin. I've lost thousands myself and felt that way. Bitcoin like the dot com might be the worst thing to happen to ordinary people in years. It's ruining lives being manipulated by very wealthy whales who have millions of easy money they can afford to lose. We only have our hard earned money.

You guys aren’t funny at all. What the fuck does Africa have to do with any of this? Does that make you feel better about losing boat loads of money...pointing the obvious fact that Africa is poor. I get it... do you have any lamer jokes? And who knows... for many poor Africans who can’t trust their oppressive governments, bitcoin might be a solution. It’s still better for them to keep bitcoin than having all their wealth stolen from them directly. And the douchebag who made that Nigerian prince 419 joke, you’re so 2007.. smh

No Friday mornings are the best time to buy. Thursday evenings and early Friday mornings can be bare. As far as not losing money, buying Friday morning and selling Friday night seems to be the safest bet.

You bitcoin nerds are so unfunny. I swear the way you guys talk and that internet jargon is fucking annoying. Speak English, stop talking like little kids.. I hate hearing this crap everyday. It’s always stupidass words like moon, lambo, hodl, Bulls etc. I hope you all get run over by a semi.

Is it just me or is Coinbase raising their fees in the midst of extremely high volume? As if I didn’t have enough reason to hate Coinbase/GDAX, they pull this crap raising their fees up to 3x the normal 0.25% fee to buy and sell Bitcoin at market prices on their exchange. Not to mention, lately GDAX has indicated “partially degraded service.” Is this a conspiracy by Coinbase, a sudden move to take advantage of this dire moment? I swear once I can get into Robinhood, I will never trade with Coinbase. I despise and hate everything about them. They are the new Mt. Gox.

$5.9K is such a cowardly price. The only reason you set that price is because that’s the Feb. 05 bottom. But do you even realize the total crytocurrrency market cap is about $25 billion less than that Feb. 05 bottom? Technically, you should be out now since overall market cap is far more indicative than Bitcoin’s price. The $5.9K price is completely arbitrary. Bitcoin’s next bottom could be $4.2K or $6.3K. For you, if Bitcoin bottoms at $5.9K again (which it won’t) and then springs back up to $40K, you’ve lost big. This is why there are only 3 types of winners in this bear market: (1) the traders who set buy-stop-orders, (2) the whales and (3) the HODLers. Everyone else will be a loser including yourself who lose faith in Bitcoin once it hits some arbitrary low that was established based on nothing. And I doubt you will be out. You’re an emotional dramaqueen so you’ll definitely be back once Bitcoin is bullish again.

I question the extent. Soros shitted on Bitcoin all of last year. Now hypocritically, he has a change of heart and wants to trade. WTF... billionaires are always twisted fucks. I wouldn’t bet favorably based on this news. It could be a positive turn for Bitcoin or it could just be bait. Only time will tell...

Lemosine you should be far more defensive. Install a stop order with $150-$200. Why would you go to bed letting the whales in control of your wealth? Place stop orders to cut your losses.

Yea but if it was $7450 today, you’d be in utter regret. That’s why you should have stop orders in a bearish market instead of expensive market orders.

The lambo jokes are getting so old not to mention most dumbass bitcoin traders, even if they do turn millionaires, you can’t just order a Lamborghini with money. You have to take a driving test, be pre-approved, have the money paid in fulll... you can’t order a lambo until you already have the money. I get it you’re being sarcastic and will never own a lambo but you suck all around!

Good observation. However no such as a bullish sign as long as whales exist. It’s always a whalish sign.

Technically the bottom bottom is 0. It can’t be negative. Though I had a very disturbing dream where I woke up and Bitcoin was worth $0.30. It was like I was the last person HODL’ing and I could cash out for like $3. Very disturbing dream. Then, I woke up and I realized I still lost a boat load of money from Bitcoin being at $7000 but at least it’s not $0.30.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:36:15
BitcoinAlways... it’s not hitting $9200.. I will pay you one whole bitcoin if it hits $9200...

Grtrjyutrt you sound like a fucking idiot. Let’s assume that Soros and Buffet (which I have no idea where you got Buffet from, it’s Soros, Rothschilds and Rockefellers)...but let’s assume old billionaires want to invest in crypto currency just to end up losing money and be stressed... are you really fucking concerned with the well-being of billionaires who lost a small portion of their wealth? What kind of simp are you? These guys won’t lose money, they haven’t got to where they are by being losers. They only win, which is why they won’t invest into Bitcoin until they see the rock bottom plus stability. Contrary to what stupid articles have been telling you, institutional investors are NOT exorbitantly investing in Bitcoin. They simply aren’t so get that out of your stupid head.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:32:16
Groundhog week anybody? We’re exactly where we were a week ago. Bitcoin has been very slow... volume has been diminished. People are still optimistic despite the market cap being below the Feb. 05 low. We still have no clue what the bottom is. Everyone thought it was $8K after its crash in February. The whales can still push it down for a lower bottom. There is tremendous resistance around $6.5K. But, what is behind that resistance? Is it the whales...is it the buying and selling trade war? I was expecting Bitcoin to be $5.5K. Perhaps I am right but it’s just being delayed. Eventually, if there isn’t any bullish action, people especially the whales will get tired of investing and move their money to traditional investments like stocks, bonds, physical commodities. I really dread a $6K-$10K movement for the rest of the year. Bitcoin today is like the hot chick who got some terrible plastic surgery.

My name is stokelycalm and I’m the biggest shorter. I see tremendous optimism in today’s daily discussion. I can’t wait until Bitcoin crashes to a $4300 bottom and all you HODLers are pissing you pants. I’ll watch panic ensue and buy lots of Bitcoin at rock bottom prices.

Spring sale? How convenient being that it’s Spring. Will you call it a Summer Sale, Fall Sale and Winter Sale when this drought continues for the rest of the year? Or will you shut the fuck up and kill yourself? And what kind of Spring sale occurs only during the first week of February, take a few weeks break and then onward from mid-March..? Some kind of shitty Spring sale. I love how you honestly you will influence anybody to buy Bitcoin when it’s not even technically $8K at this moment. You are about as influential as a wet fart. I hope you go away forever in the next few months when you realize it’s not just a Spring sale.

@_date: 2018-04-13 01:26:29
Do a stop order, sell at $7500. Put all your bitcoins by clicking on your number of bitcoins. For example if you have 4.3 BTC, click on 4.3 and it will populate the funds you wold get at a stop order of $7500. GDAX now tells you the fee associated with that order. That’s why I hate stop orders. Limit orders have no fees. And yes you are a noob.

BitcoinAlways I hate everything about individuals like you. You people are like televangelists preaching prosperity theology to desperate people looking to get away from a life of poverty for some financial freedom. The reality is Bitcoin may NEVER hit 1 million, but if it does, it’s a very long time from today. I think by Jan. 2022, Bitcoin will hit $40,000 which is a very realistic projection based on past trends. However, that excites no one especially by suggesting that Bitcoin will first experience tremendous stagnancy for the next few years. I predict by Nov. 2018, Bitcoin will be $4000. Today, it’s about $6800. This news does not excite anyone even though it’s far more realistic than your bullshit.

It’s not George Soros, you idiot. It’s you being misled by news article that Soros started investing in crypto currency when he hasn’t even touched it. Soros is only worth $8 billion, of which he doesn’t not plan to invest even 1% of that. Most Soros would invest is $80 million which would not affect Bitcoin’s price the slightest.

You’re a 100% right. It’s impossible for there to be zero people interested. The dynamics of that would make no sense especially when by 2021, Bitcoin will be pumped up to $40,000 before it crashes again down to $14,000. And I appreciate you’d be willing to buy it off me, but no crazy mind buys Bitcoin when it’s fallen down to $0.30.
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:20:38
9k is difficult because there is tremendous resistance to surpass $9K. The whales have limit sell orders to ensure it either doesn’t pass $9K or returns to $8800-9K levels. What does this mean? It’s definitely not a good sign. It’s indicative of a fatal crash. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:31:08

@_date: 2018-04-23 14:05:42
That fork is only the catalyst. The reason people are buying is because of emotions. Many Bitcoin investors are getting impatient and frustrated with Bitcoin remaining stagnant while Bitcoin has repetitively shown gains of 20% everyday. Eventually, when the cryptocurrency market falls again in the new few weeks, Bcash will be the biggest loser. And it could happen exactly around or before the Bitcoin ABC fork being released on May 15th. Thus, I would not encourage anyone to believe to stick with Bcash until the fork is released. That’s purely speculation, you still have to be very cautious. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:04:17
Well you’re an idiot. Maybe, the whales are female because they’re unpredictable and irrational since they manipulate Bitcoin’s prices. But, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that doesn’t get to choose its own fate. People and investors that.
