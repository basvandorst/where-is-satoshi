You should be more condescending, they love that.

It just depends on how much $3k is to you.  If $60/month is no big deal, then the loan is no big deal.  If it's significant, then it's a terrible idea.
Also, you're going to have to deal with the stress of watching your borrowed investment inevitably plummet.  I've been holding all of my crypto and the last month has been pretty difficult although it seems to be finally getting back to normal.

Because business, finance, law, sophisticated, important.

I don't think many people believed it would hit 10k if you rewind a year.  I've learned that basically everything will happen to bitcoin.

Can't believe this has no replies.  I just found it from Googling as I'm completely new to all of this.  Thanks for the info.

It blows my mind why people find this so hard to understand.   I trade crypto and regularly access my wallet (so I don't have to keep the bulk of my shares on an exchange).  Accessing my private key on a regular basis is not only insecure, but it's a huge pain in the ass.

Is there any service I can subscribe to that just automatically deducts that amount from my bank / credit card and converts it to bitcoin?  That would be a fun way to invest for me.

Mainly so you can withdraw easily without having to type in your private key every time (making you vulnerable to keyloggers).

And a safe within another safe, buried in the ground, is safer than that.

You should add some Diablo 3 gold in there to level things out a bit.
