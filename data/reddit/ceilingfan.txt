Rachel Maddow is out clamoring for WWIII with bullshit Russia propaganda. Should her dangerous lies be censored too?

So what you're saying is the gay couple attacked this man because of his religion and hassled him to the Supreme Court? That's some fucked up bigotry

Who do you think your government listens to the most? You? Working Americans? Or the board members of Fortune 500 companies that donate millions of dollars?
We don't have a government beholden to the people.

You're dumb. Not even white people were allowed to vote in the early States. LANDOWNERS did. USA is ruled by money, always has and always will. Blaming others with no money and no power is what they want us to do.

Rachel Maddow told me so in between crazed Russia conspiracy theories and excuses why the most well funded political machine lost to a jerkoff gameshow host.

Inverse totalitarianism. Ruled by the faceless corporations

So nice that silicon valley decides the boundaries of free speech for us so we don't have to think. Very helpful for them to screen all speech in case someone gets offended

True but companies facilitate our entire network of communication and news and control them to a horrifying degree; more than in many, many decades. What happens when no free speech alternatives exist? Government isn't going to do shit for anyone without $$$.

Don't worry! The government will give them free money to bail them out.
