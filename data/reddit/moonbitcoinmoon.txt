Have there been any recent about Confidential Transactions for Bitcoin? When can a CT sidechain be expected?

November 2015 was a long time ago and a lot of Bitcoin development has occurred since then.

Great graphic to show to newcomers that dont want to buy Bitcoin "because it is too expensive" or similar poor reasons.
Bitcoin is more that just a leader in acceptance, liquidity, hash rate and price. It has more development  and rigorous testing standards for new features that any other project. Most blockchain face a significant risk of failure if one or two key developers leave or a new feature (with little peer review) is introduced

Finding the best answer for blocksize scaling is not easy. I do like the idea of trying to codify scaling to happen automatically and carefully thinking about incentives and possible ways the system could be gamed.
It is interesting to hear different proposals discussed and compared to one another. SegWit (just merged) was a very good thing and will allow the Bitcoin developers more time to plan for additional scaling needs further into the future.

I support BTC. Thank your for making it clear that you support BTC (as defined by the community and developers) as well.  BTC will remain BTC

I am not sure if his story is the most fascinating or not, but his picture is clearly # 1
