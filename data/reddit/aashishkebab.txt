This may be a stupid question, but what wallet do you use to transact Lightning on the mainnet?
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:43:57
I use BitPay.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:13:59
Oh I'm sure that's it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:01:56
Your posts are getting pretty annoying.

It's already gone down 10%. Hopefully it stops.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:10:59
At what price?

Code is not that complex, it can be understood by anyone because it's open source, the whole point of decentralisation is that actually everybody and nobody controls it, not "controlled by even fewer", and there is no need for accountability because it is decentralised. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:46:10
No it's not. Not really, except maybe from Ethereum.

He actually tweeted that he would, and Coinbase said last December that they would though it is low priority. 
But just now, I think it's become much higher priority.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:58:56
Your second point is the same as mine. You are free. There is no controlling entity.
And why the hell would it take two days?

The average fee right now is actually just over 100 Satoshis per byte. You can get away with less, but that's the average.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:25:29
You're increased earnings are due to the increased price of Bitcoin. 
Transaction fees only make up about 20% of the payouts from mining. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:57:28
It's not about libertarianism. You don't have to be entirely libertarian, but it is oxymoronic to be statist and authoritarian like Trump while supporting decentralized currency that has no authority.

Somebody on r/AMD sold theirs for $700.
Also, if you do want to buy a GPU by itself, Best Buy is the best place, because they haven't inflated the prices nearly as much as Newegg and Amazon, or at least the third party sellers on there.
For example, the 1080 is $1,000 on Newegg but $649 at Best Buy. Both prices are of course higher tab MSRP, but what to do...

Here's an RX 580 4 GB on Newegg:

He'd have to open a payment channel. He could later close the payment channel with a previous version of the chain, thereby getting his money back as well as all of the robbers' money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:50:22
True, but there aren't any in stock. That's the thing. Nobody has any in stock.

Owning a lot of the current does not mean controlling it. If he sold all of it, it would only affect the price by 5%. While that's significant, it's hardly controlling. 
The dev teams work on stuff, but anyone can be a dev at any time for any reason because it's open source. Anyone can modify the code and "release" an update, it's just the adoption that matters. You can create your own fork, soft or hard, for any reason. It's complete anarchy. 
It's truly decentralized.

I caught it at $11,1111 once.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:33:14
My wallet is estimating a fee of 112 sat/byte right now.

What one person controls Bitcoin?

I always say to remember that the worse case scenario is you throwing that money into a toilet and flushing.

A government would need to have enough funds to keep sending it over the network.

Bitcoin isn't fallen, at all, it's still worth more than it was two months ago. It's overall been growing, and rapidly. Just because it takes one hit, it isn't the end.
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:47:18
There is a reason we, they are a major contributing factor to high fees. 
Also, why is a statist Trump supporter like you investing in decentralized currency? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:16:06
Today it's because India announced some bans. All crypto is down, not just BTC.

You can buy an entire PC with a particular GPU cheaper than buying the GPU by itself.

I waa only going based on how the market was doing with it. I know it's technologically inferior.

The number of Ethereum will never change.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:05:19
Coinbase is not running the latest software that's the problem. No SegWit.
And the fact is, Trump is extremely statist, and crypto is the opposite, anti government.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:52:49
Bitcoin has taken multiple falls before. And it's always come back with a vengeance.
It's still worth more than it was two months ago.

It differs in philosophy compared to what? Itself?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:59:01
Number of pools is different than total number of individuals mining.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:55:57
Plus Coinbase is now rolling it SegWit.

This is not even close to how Bitcoin mining works.
I cannot answer your question because your question does not make even a little sense.
There is no such thing as a "Bitcoin share".
Miners are pieces of computer equipment that solve algorithms in order to verify that transactions are legitimate. As a reward for doing this, they receive some Bitcoin as a reward.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:26:36
Oh look, a btrash shill.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:04:55
Just about everything in your post is incorrect.
It is not physically possible for a merchant to dictate which transactions are correct. This is done by miners, and only miners.
BitPay simply requires a specific protocol that ensures the correct amount of Bitcoin is sent, nothing else.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:12:27
India did hold about 10% of the market of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:55:44
A miner doesn't receive a set amount of Bitcoin. Rather, they receive the transaction fees of all people who go through your miner, as well as the block reward *If* you are the one you solve a block.
This is unlikely for any individual, so people usually join pools that combine power and split rewards. The more overall hashpower, the less each individual gets.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:23:46
But not Bcash.

It's no problem dude. Just letting you know your original question didn't make sense.
All pools will yield the same block reward. However, smaller pools will give more per person, but they are *less likely* to hit the reward/solve a block.
