Are the mods changing their posting rules or did this slip through the cracks? I thought if you post something purely about bcash it gets taken down. At least that’s what happened when I posted about ver on CNBC a while ago

Honest (probably dumb) question. If the company lightning labs goes out of business is lightning network gone then too? Would implementing lighting network make it centralized and easier to hack or get shut down by governments?

I heard roger say bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin though... I saw a YouTube video he said he was rich. I’m buying bcash suckers 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:16:16
Is this Roger Ver?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:54
if Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin, I’m going to buy it on coinbase and use it at Expedia.com

This comment makes me wonder if it actually pro-btc person posing as pro-bch trying to sound like a stupid troll. Therefore hurting the bch value by presenting its users as a few assholes and sock puppets.

I been waiting 3 days so far, for 3 transactions I sent with breadwallet economy 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:51:16
Hmm, I was thinking of buying more . Figured with no fork no huge price swings. Guess I’ll wait 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:21:51
This comment is boss. And fits my basic understanding. Thank you.

Pretty good troll. 7 out of 10
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:34:33
Are u fucking high?! Don’t use “bitcoin” and “sell” in the same sentence. It’s something you only buy from dumb people. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:15:32
How do you deal with the regret of not investing more?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:49:47
U were right
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:51:36
Yeah don’t go to “the d” casino at the downtown strip which accepts bitcoin and has the most attractive staff to spend the magic money. Don’t 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:26:46
I was just going to ask you join my bitcoin atm heist team too.. you blew it

“Inside trading is a non-crime” -roger ver
Wonder how much longer till he goes back to jail for something.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:30:37
“Bcash is not related to bitcoin cash, it’s a separate project” I can’t stand ver... but that was a pretty clever way to try to get people to stop calling it bcash. Con-artist 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:01:50
You are not thinking. What is a “best” coin? How it came about is what makes it what it is. Look at Bitconnect coin. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:52:23
Well for arguments sake let’s say bch is technically better than btc. And so is BitconnectCoin (bcc). Do you want to buy a coin that is based off intentionally deceiving people? Ver said himself about bch being listed on coinbase and inside trading was a “non-crime” . When you have scammy people behind a coin , you have a scam coin. This is why btc is better.

“Let me hold my camera up to your ass to take a pic of ur qr code... oops I was taking video.. it didn’t work let me try again... oh this wallet is empty, let me try again... it’s not working let me turn on the flash light... fuck it. I’ll just give you a dollar, sorry about all the pics and videos I took of you
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:13:33
Just like Bitconnect coin. I think I would rather own counterfeit usd. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:19:16
Bcash is another name bitcoin cash. Ver hates people calling it bcash because because he wants to sell his coin to people thinking they are buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:59:19
I would seriously make a bet that if bch is taken off coinbase, ver would have the inside info and sell all his bch make a billion dollars and disappear like cryptonick. Inside trading is a “non-crime” according to him on his Bloomberg interview after all .
