It's just saying that as an Indian national you are considered permenant slave property of their socialistic and paternalistic government and must obey the rules of said state like a child, no matter where you go in the world.
Nothing offensive.

Why not just try use litecoin for day to days ? Bitcoin is like your savings account. Litecoin can be checking.

I sort of agree, Blockchain universe operates largely outside SEC regulations for now, especially as exchanges are not public companies yet. 
Don't get me wrong, I think Ver should be perpwalked in an orange jumpsuit myself. But I think right now it should be the FTC stuffing him up the ass for fraud, willfull misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and racketeering. 
RICO law should do fine.

The can call themselves Bitcoin Cash, and BCH. But what's crooked is there's "bitcoin.com" and r/BTC, which are really shilling for BCH and The Bitcoin Cash fork 24 hours a day and deliberately promoting name confusion inside a wallet app for their own hidden gain(selling BCH). This is FTC RICO level stuff IMO. Although the FTC may be happy to see all crypto commuities eat each other in the defense of FIAT. Also, any poster pointing this out is harrassed by these BCH shills and called a retard. It almost reminds me of a certain bullying political movement(that ended up losing) last year. 
By all means, come and tell us about the technical merits of your particular coin though. Tell us about your quantum computer you built in your garage that will crack double 256bit encryption blockchain too.

If you care about someone (I don't), and want to get them on the bitcoin bandwagon that badly. 
Gift them $40-50 to a wallet on their cellphone, show them how to back it up. Let them watch it go up in value, while all other money and accounts that they own in this world get hit with fees, and FIAT dilution every other day.
It may be the first "real money" they ever own that can't be diluted to nothing or given away by bureaucrats of one form or another. You can't explain it. They have to *experience* it.
Since 1972 all money has ultimately been a political entity. People don't understand this because most of them have had no experience like it in their lifetime. 
The agreed value can change and will up and down, at the consensus of the users, but an outside force can't reassign your value, or give away value on a whim.

To be fair to coinbase, the money laundering laws basically require them to rough up a granny once in a while to make it look like they are doing something. 
Like the banks will report to the DEC that they are volentarially unplugging on of their 5000 ATMs to stop drug trafficking. It's easier to harass honest people who won't make a fuss than real criminals who might get violent until you absolutely have to.
The appearance of the LAW must be maintained especially  as it is being BROKEN.
Banksters have carried their practiced and habits to coinbase

I'm buying more on Monday. So if it crashes it will probably do so Tuesday. It has to be money you can afford to lose, or you'll be trading out down on the next scare and manage to lose out even if it goes to a 100k or 1M
You need to hold the bulk for a year anyways for a capital gain,  otherwise you're gambling your wealth to make money for uncle Sam.

Nobody is held accountable for anything, nobody even apologizes anymore. I hope 50 class action suit against coinbase get registered tommorow. I'd love to see 25 state attorney general's take up the coinbase jihad too.

Mainstream Media is taking a run at BTC today with articles shilling how "Big Early Developers" are moving to Bitcoin Cash, and all the "development money" is going to Bitcoin cash.
When will people realize what a monster this Ver guy is ? He's trying to invert Bitcoin and make himself instant billionaire. Imagine it worked .... What does this say to everyone who dipped their toes in crypto ? Put your money in and at any time your store of value can invert into another and you lose 90% of your wealth in an inversion when new and shiny comes along. 
If you invent something new with better utility for transactions, or trading currency or smart contracts or tracking your tinder dates ICO thats great. But basically BC Cash is just taking a run at all the HODLer in the world and trying to steal their value like FIAT govt's
And YES the FTC should be raiding bitcoin.com offices. The practices and statements are willfully deceptice.

He's not lying IMO. Business is booming and he doesn't give a shit. Its .com fuck you money squared. You can see this all over the industry with the founders and pioneers. If you're in the right place you're getting very rich whether or not you follow up on shit or do a good job or not. Hes the leadng retail brand for the next investment crack cocaine in the world's largest economy. He's going to take 5 percent net in fees times however many billion flow through . So long as they don't lose the keys he and his whole family set for life generations. Everything else that happens is just "interesting". IPO now or later, support trading intercoin.
Honestly all changes involve risk. Main incentive is to adapt as slow as possible and try to contain backlash on the mini crashes. Hence the invest wisely newsletter.
It's like a hedge fund that isn't even sure it wants more investors at tthis point.

People want into crypto as a hedge against the perpetual decline of FIAT. They don't want to fumble with keys, passcodes and custodial issues, or be told they are stupid for mishandling an ewallet. The ETF is a net HLDR. If people want to trade the ETFs they will lose to the exchanges and market makers just like people who trade BTC. This is a pathway for billions into BTC for middle class. ETFs have lower fees than pretty much any other investment product. And yes, there are fees because people in the industry are there to make money.

Let's say you got in after the BTC fork as bitcoin hits the mainstream. Say you're on coinbase and you're dropping a little hard earned FIAT each week. BHC wasn't even offered. There this guy with 50B behind him trying to invert everything you put in. You login and coinbase and it's like good morning ! Roger ver had all your money ! 
The price is pivoting like it did around segwitt 2x, with money going to greedy miners spamming the mempool and FUD distributors all around. Brokers and exchanges see all the end users as punters at the crypto brothel IMO. People hate bankers and the cable companies but the crypto Industry seems like it's trying to give them a run for their money.

Bitcoin cash is Shillcoin/Snake Salesman, trying to "Invert" bitcoin to zero
Urethrum(Ethereum) is backed by a 23YO russian-leaf coder that looks like he could have a Energy Drink induced Heart Attack tommorow. 
LiteCoin is the a summer project of some rich googler at coinbase who doesn't care about it and has said he thinks it's going down. (still the best of these 3 alts IMO)

Do you think these exchanges all have 1:1 reserve? They trade in real time, but bitcoin blocks take 10 minutes to settle. They match up the buy sell with their own accounts, but how to they settle net trades in and out of fiat ? 
I'd bet there's fuc\*ery going. Next major swing in either direction will take out an exchange or two. It's the wild wild west.
