Sent my bitcoins to Finex literally hours before they went offline. Fuck me right? 
I'd have sympathy if this was some "act of god" in the legal sense, but turns out this is good ol' human failure - so don't expect any kind words from me when I'm most likely going to be the one paying for their amateur shitshow.

For all of us ey? How about we trade places? I put my PR cap on and respond to some reddit comments, and you sit on the i-just-got-fucked chair with your money stuck in limbo.

Not to worry, a tipping point should come this year where enough people realize that keeping a network around that delivers a subpar experience using now antiquated tech while requiring the energy upkeep of a small country is frankly pointless. Save the planet, kill Bitcoin.

17:50. Szabo "I have never heard that opinion before. I have never heard anyone call Bitcoin's script Turing complete. I don't believe that is accurate." 
Seeing as how Jon Matonis discusses The Other Coin at length EVEN in his Satoshi reveal post, I can't help but consider this whole situation very suspicious. Sign publically or GTFO! Alleged signings behind closed doors don't mean shit, especially in an ecosystem that is so rife with all kinds of interests like Bitcoin.

How hilarious would it be if the real Satoshi decides to play along with Craig's plan and move the coins in order to take the heat off of him.
Satoshi can proceed to enjoy his privacy and Puppet King Craig can take his place at the helm of Bitcoin development until enough people figure out he isn't all that or he runs the project into the ground.
