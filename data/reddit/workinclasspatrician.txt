this has to be fake post with bot/paid upvotes. Literally hundreds of these reviews exist and this one adds nothing new. Half of the posts in crypto are fake these days.

Coldcard is terrible to use.

Actually this is a problem, especially with a finite supply of said currency.  This will become more apparent as time goes on.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:34:14
agreed and thus why I said 3rd largest. they publicly stated they've sold over 100K awhile back. with their partnership with SBI Holdings and other cobranded cards, that's probably accurate.

I could potentially write anything I want, like u/btchip, but then how could you trust my review? The best would be to verify on your own. 
The problem i'm pointing out is that the messenger IS the problem due to inherent bias in an attempt to shape consumer opinion.

Currency is really the wrong concept here. It's really a digital store of value, like gold. And really this particular discussion should be focusing on that bitcoin is yet another instance of haves vs have nots, rather than the nature of the currency itself.  
BTC has benefitted the following: 1. early adopters (which is fine with me) 2. centralized exchanges (not fine with me) 3. well-established fiat money like the rich, fin. institutions, tech billionaires (way not cool for me)  
Either way, ownership of bitcoin is centralized in very small networks of power. For example, .65% of all BTC addresses own 87% of all BTC. 48% of all BTC addresses own .01% of all BTC. Therefore BTC has benefited a tiny group of people more than anyone else.

I will bet all my BTC you've never heard of the coolwallet. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 07:27:08
I can go onto google and type in "best wallets for BTC" and see basically the same content on 100s of other, mindlessly identical articles. That's not going to help your SEO either. No mention of the coolwallet s, samurai, or many better wallets out there.   
It's like a high-school popularity contest structured as an affiliate post (many of your links are referral links). 
@_date: 2019-03-07 11:56:04
Dude, I have literally seen it first-hand in silicon valley. Many tech billionaires and VCs already have a toe in BTC, not to mention in New York many hedge funds use crypto on the side. The rich have already entered - the next bull run will bring in the rest of their buddies.
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:13:27
**KeepKey, BitBox02 and Coldcard Mk3 the most popular hardware wallets? Coolwallet is 3rd largest in terms of market share and you're reviewing barely functional ones? Yeah, not going to trust this review if you can't even get the basics correct.**
@_date: 2019-03-07 07:20:30
Never used a coolwallet, huh? 
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:43:36
 u/nonesticula, u/btchip is the CTO of Ledger. Do you expect an unbiased review of a competing product? Coolwallet was doing bluetooth smartphone hardware wallets 2 years before ledger copied them. Of course Ledger is going to throw shade on their security.

It's one thing to bust child porn networks, and another thing to get giddy on marketing off this event like Chainalysis did. I wonder...do they really have any incentive to prevent or reduce crime? Doesn't their business model kick-in *after* a crime is committed? Yeah that's a rhetorical question.

Hackers have control of Cryptopia's wallets. Let's see if they're Robin Hood (you'll get your $5 back) or train robbers (you won't get your $5 back).

It's easy to distance yourself from coinbase. In the past maybe it was more difficult, but there are many wallets and exchanges out there that are eroding coinbase's value proposition.

I suggest you look into what is AES256 encryption, asymmetric cryptography, and whole you're at it, secure element microchip. BLE is literally like any other signal. Have a nice day :)

If someone steals your device, they can use an antenna to sniff. and also wtf, f00dbabe &amp; playing snake on a nano? lol trolling at its best. also it is exceedingly easy to implement if you know what you're doing.

So you're saying they are black hat? I didn't see you in the audience. I did, however, see Trezor's CTO. fyi, that's how to handle these situations. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:32:43
Just copying the coolwallet...but in a thumb drive form :(  but has more coin support :) but with numerous apps :( but has brand name :) but was just successfully hacked :(. That's a 3 - 2 sad face to happy face ratio. I'll stick with my coolwallet.
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:06:41
hmmm, the elephant in the room is the fact that tom roth &amp; co purposefully didn't disclose malicious information as they're 'white hat' - yet they mentioned they did find quite a few exploits and declined to share it aka "non-offensive example\[s\]". Competent malicious hackers understand this, and have been given a huge advantage.  They successfully indicated ways to exploit the MCU without cracking the SE itself via compressor/extractor.   
That being said, Mr. Bacca (Ledger CTO),  you guys have finally begun to validate bluetooth. You have no idea how many times i've tried to convince others that there is something deemed safe BLE implementation. THANK YOU! Just please make sure it's not compromised (or take seriously your bug bounty program - you guy have a history of not handling the trickster hackers properly), because the general public will condemn it to eternal "bluetooth is not safe" territory.  
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:24:24
Well you *could* lose a few satoshi on your phone, but why would you even want that? It's really a matter of principle.  **Any** hacks in this industry is terrible for mass adoption - every hack makes it look like we don't have our sh\*t together.   
If you lose both, it's still fine because you'll need you biometric data to authorize any transaction - and you have your backup seed.  
But yes, it literally can do anything a USB hardware wallet can do, i.e. use it at home, keep in a safe, but can also use it anywhere, anytime, with anyone. Use case = order of magnitude larger than USBs.

You had a few questions about using your nano s with a phone:




the coolwallet is as secure (if not more) than a nano s. It has a secure element, can be stored anywhere, cannot be opened and reprogrammed, and works for iphone or android. I've never had to worry about operating a complex system of multiple wallets. 
nano s wasn't made for a phone. coolwallet is. 
Here's a scenario: 
Ledger + software wallet: you keep your ledger locked away for cold storage and keep a software wallet. Once in awhile you move small funds to a software wallet for ease and convenience. Quite a few steps that require a ton of commitment. 
Coolwallet:  have cold storage security and ease/convenience wherever and whenever. no crazy steps required, no commitment needed. 
also ask/look/research around, most (non-biased) users prefer the coolwallet to a ledger.

Okay fine. Be more cautious. Don't be culpable in spreading unwarranted hype.
If FuzeX didn't live up to the hype (which you are literally trying create again for them), and their 'wallet' is not ready, and they already have $65 million war chest, why conduct a pre-sale? 
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:21:35
So basically like FU SEX?
Hi BrilliantTS team, we all know you're behind these fake comments. This aint going to work well for you this time.
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:21:14
Yin and Yang. Centralization and decentralization. You can't have one without the other. Too much of one side is unhealthy.   
For example, how do you create a truly decentralized exchange without some level of centralizing aspects (developers building the platform, users logging in, leadership, employees, rules, etc)? And doesn't some centralization make it more suitable for mass adoption? 
I'm pretty sure Vitalik knows this.  
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:10:45
The only thing Fuze has produced are angry customers. Thus, your shill for them is very perplexing...I'm not the first to call them a scam, and I won't be the last.   
So either you're, at best, not conducting proper due diligence and researching this company.   
OR  
At worst, getting incentivized to shill.   
How else would you be able to get a hold of the wallets before they're even on the market if you weren't cozying up to them? Also, are those really your hands in the picture, or did Fuze send you those pics?   
Because if you actually used their products (or read any actual customer review) you'd know they don't work.  
I've burned by them before - I purchased their FuzeX which felt fake and didn't charge. I don't want others to fall into their trap.  Who buys into a pre-sale for an unverified product from a sketchy company?   
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:04:37
unlikely. It should be the other way around - not banks though, but regulators.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:00:15
it's also non-custodial, which mean you have to register as a money transmitter.

Meanwhile Square will have to stop bitcoin withdrawal off their Cash App soon.
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:49:36
Not fear mongering. Believe me, I wish it weren't so. Don't downvote the messenger. I love cash app and I don't want regs to stop my BTC withdrawals to my wallet. 
But I read the news and follow regulation closely. You should too.  
Below are links with TLDR
1. [


What does this mean? This will apply wire transfers laws to crypto transfers. That means no more anonymous withdrawals to your paper wallet, hardware wallet, software wallet from Square, Coinbase, Gemini, any other compliant exchange.    
Don't believe me? Know this: the FATF is the AML/CTF mafia and every participating country ( which means virtually every developed country) must listen to them or face severe economic punishments. And these countries do listen.
BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE ENACTED IN JUNE 2019. 
2. "Yeah sure, *okay.* But FATF isn't the US. Won't happen to me!"
Yeah read FinCEN guidance to enforcement release two weeks ago...
Page 11 for fun


"What's the travel rule," You ask?
Here you go:






















3. "If this is such a big deal why haven't I heard about this?"
Because most don't WANT to think about it as it is too uncomfortable to process. 
Still, for fun, here is just a very small sample of major reports on pro-crypto news sites: 
1. [Coindesk three days ago](
2. [Coindesk one month ago](
3. [Coindesk today](
4. [Nikkei yesterday](
5. [Cointelegraph yesterday](
6. [Cointelegraph last month](


What does this mean for BTC withdrawals off of Square (and EVERY SINGLE US EXCHANGE)? 
1. Currently, I can withdraw my BTC off of Cash App anytime to any wallet. (Yes I had to KYC but that is irrelevant moving forward)
2. Square will be responsible for the flow of that withdrawn BTC to other financial institutions, sanctioned countries, terrorist's wallets, criminal organizations, or just your average American. 
3. The very anonymous nature of the addresses means that regulators will enforce this sooner or later.
4. What will Square do? Keep allowing you to withdraw to random addresses and suffer millions of USD worth of fines from FinCEN, DoJ, OFAC? OR will they shut down withdrawals until a system allows users to compliantly withdraw? The latter, duh, they're a for-profit business. 
5. Well...the rules are already there. They just haven't been enforced. And boy will they be enforced this summer or fall.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:59:45
yeah well, they are now a money transmitter
