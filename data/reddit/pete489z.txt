@_date: 2014-03-31 21:07:28
Thank you

Did you ask them when they would annouce it?

If someone is under 18 and trading bitcoin, do they have to file taxes on gains too?

I bought a few for over 800+, completely regret it, you cant let your emotions control you in those situations.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:40:14
It really does

Definatly Coinbase for it's simplicity

That may be true, but I'm pretty sure that the average apartment size in NYC is substantially larger than in let's say Amsterdam, and NYC is pretty dense.

But Americans are so much more wasteful compared to Europeans, which is what I meant
@_date: 2013-07-21 17:06:46
Oh sorry, didn't realize this was frowned upon, thanks
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:22:42
but it has nothing to do with people asking simple questions
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:03:59
If you don't mind me asking, how much total did this cost you?
@_date: 2013-08-06 06:03:40
this is also a good bitcoin show called plan B 
@_date: 2013-07-21 19:19:19
That's actually already figured out, its called being European, which I am in favor of.

I think its only good to do this if the people receiving the paper wallets need to be relatively close, and the group cant be too big.
@_date: 2013-07-22 03:53:58
That's no reason to downvote ;)
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:39:41
thats true ik, but if I spent 5K on this I would be stretching my budget a little.

But reducing emissions is certainly more feasible and popular than destroying people's way of life
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:46:05
any relative prices yet?
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:43:35
The neptune seems very good but its pretty expensive, im looking for something a little cheaper, I would rather buy a few cheaper ones than one expensive one.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:03:19
I see your point, and I agree
@_date: 2013-07-21 14:55:45
Or simply use renewables, and strive for negative carbon emissions, why make the whole economy suffer?
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:20:27
Do you have a better idea of a name?
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:46:18
hey thanks anyways
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:41:32
I thought that BFL was only very late with their pre-orders, but the mineers they have in stock should be ok, right?

In a lot of things like smaller housing, smaller cars, manuel cars ( not sure how it is in Holland, but in Poland they justify using manuel because its more efficient) and many European countries subsidize clean energy like solar(especially in Germany) and wind.
Which all help with using less fossil fuels.
