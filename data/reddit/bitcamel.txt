It is possible that a majority of the network could agree to change the Bitcoin protocol to increase the limit cap. But of course, such changes will have to be approached very cautiously.

If it's a percentage fee, say 0.5%, there wouldn't be much difference between buying a few times versus buying several times no?

Bitstamp, btc-e and many of the biggest exchanges operate on percentage fees. The percentage fees drop as your trading volume increases, but they're still percentage fees.

In SSS, you can also split the private key into multiple shares and specify how many shares you require to reconstruct the private key.
Say I split it into 5 shares and require 3 to form the private key. Each of the 5 shares is distributed to 5 different people.
Unless the majority, 3 or more people agree to use the funds, the funds cannot be touched.
So in this regard, how is it different from multisig?
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:16:18
Well done, we need more of this kind of stuff to encourage adoption. I just have a little issue with this: 


Storing with third parties, like Gox? Maybe "third parties with solid credentials" would be a better term or upcoming multi-sig services.

itBit and Bitfinex have a taker maker model. If I'm not mistaken, you actually accrue trading rebates if you submit limit orders that provide liquidity on itBit. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Alternatively, instead of splitting the 12 word seed into first 6 words + last 6 words, one can consider using the Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme algo. It can split a seed into M shards and you can specify the minimum N of M number of shards to reconstruct the full seed. 
Note that despite its N of M scheme, it's not the same as using a multi-sig address.

Noob question here: does this mean that we will see a sharp increase in the % hash rate signalling for Segwit?

According to Shaolinfry in the mailing list: "Someone sent me a copy of the Barry Silbert agreement, an agreement forged between a select number of participants 
Participants agree to immediately activate Segwit, however, under a different activation proposal. Since I have spent the last few months researching various activation strategies of the current BIP141 deployment, as well as redeployment, I feel I am quite well placed to comment on the technicalities."

Hopefully Segwit gets implemented within this year. Otherwise these awesome projects will slip away from Bitcoin forever 
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:41:27
Does this require segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-07 08:53:34
Remember Wang Chun and F2Pool? He did a Twitter poll like this ( and shortly switched to signalling Segwit after that. ViaBTC's poll might indeed just be a 'get-out clause' for them to justify changing their stance
