I'm long btc, but disagreeing with your opinion can hardly be considered "losing all reason."

The fact that high-end escort services flourish relatively un-encumbered by sanction suggest the distinction might not be as easy as you think.

Judging by the caliber of the questions you're asking, and the caliber of the responses you're getting, I am super excited to read your finished article.

A brilliant comment -- lost in all the technological triumphalism is the fact that a handful of people in the community control its technical direction, and have the power to determine the fate of the currency in a way no single person can with fiat.  
For instance, the deflationary nature of bitcoin that people go on about is not something passed down from god on a stone tablet -- if Gavin et al. went on a retreat and ate the right mushrooms and decided that the 21 million limit was a Really Bad Idea, bye-bye goes the limit.  And yes, miners could refuse to upgrade their software; and yes, the blockchain could be forked; and yes, there could be a hundred other kinds of civil war over the issue.  But that's the point -- these are not scenarios bitcoin is magically absolved from; a relatively small cabal controls all this.  I think they're doing the best they can, and they have the best interests of bitcoin, as it is generally understood, at heart; but even people with good intentions don't always agree, as the recent debate about coin validation shows.
And aside from the developers, of course, we now have a ton of sharks smelling blood in the water.  Bitcoin has been a happy little curiosity until recently, but shit just got real.  I'm not saying the whole  endeavor is doomed, but the Nazgul are sniffing around the Shire, and only an idiot would pretend otherwise.

Nothing.  That's what the state is for -- to be a common actor that can enforce contracts according to some more or less agreed upon legal infrastructure.  You can't replace this with a private entity without getting the state involved somehow, unless you build some parallel state, that can coerce people in other ways (reputation markets or something?)
Despite what some people wish, banishing the state != panacea for all problems.  Once you start adding back in the elements you need to implement stuff like contracts, protection of the commons, etc., you wind up, once again, having a state.

Jesus I laughed for thirty seconds out loud. Thanks.
