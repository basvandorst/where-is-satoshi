Now that I think about it, after the 2FA it made me confirm my Gmail password also. And THAT password is saved in my Google keychain. For some reason I didn't think about phishing in that split second, I assumed it was Binance's extra security feature even though I've logged in 100 times before and it's never asked for my Gmail password.

No, I have 2FA only on Binance, Coinbase, and Amazon.

When I entered the code for my 2FA from Google Authenticator, it asked for a second 2FA code.

I should've used the URL to type it in as I usually do. But I think now that I googled Binance and clicked the top result which did say binance.com. So if it was a phishing site, they cloaked the URL to make even the URL look like the correct site? I forgot to check if it said https but it definitely said binance.com

I work at UC Riverside. I think I clicked an ad for Binance. I know not to do that but I must've not been thinking clearly at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:55:02
I did!

I had 2FA enabled on Google Authenticator on my phone. This happened after a log in on a computer I hadn't used before. I was planning to move everything to wallets but hadn't figured out how to get an ADA wallet or a TRX wallet yet.

Yes and I entered the 2FA codes. The only possibility I see now is that it was a fake site. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:43:15
That might be it. The more I think about it, the more I think it was a fake site. I usually enter binance.com in the URL but I think this time I clicked the  result on Google and I have no idea why I would do that. I must've been in a daze. I didn't want my boss to see me logging into it or something.

I checked my Gmail just now and see that in my trash folder there's an email with the withdrawal confirmation link. So they used it and then deleted the email.

I had 2FA enabled. This happened after I logged in and had trouble because I entered one number in the password wrong the first time. I re-entered the password and then it asked for 2FA. I thought it was an extra security measure because I've never entered the password incorrectly before. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:55:55
This happened after I logged in from a new computer at work, instead of from my phone as usual. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:58:43
So this is why it made me log in twice? I thought it was that I had entered my password incorrectly the first time, but now I think it was correct both times. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:58:56
I used 2FA!

So is there any chance that UCR's IT department can help me since it was on a UCR computer? Or that Google can be liable because they put a phishing site as  in their search results?

It was 6 minutes between the initial login and the withdrawal, but I found out about the withdrawal later and only by logging in from my phone. The pc login never appeared to complete. It was not a "public" computer technically. Only the 15 or so people who work in our office can log in, and anyone who previously worked there or works in IT.

It's wishful thinking. I know how bitcoin works but I was hoping someone would know something I didn't know that would help me get it back. I wasn't planning to keep it all on the exchange, but I got carried away making trades constantly and I was planning to move the other coins to wallets. I had anywhere from 0.02 BTC to 0.50 BTC of each of about 20 different coins. How did the hacker manage to sell all of them instantly?
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:14:56
I know the transactions cannot be reversed. But I did NOT initiate the transaction. I logged into Binance yesterday to find a balance of 0.001 BTC remaining and a record of all the sales and the withdrawal having been done without my consent.

I logged in from a work computer and I thought I must've entered my password incorrectly the first time, because it asked for the email and password a second time. I also had 2FA enabled! It asked me for 2FA to log in to the computer, then said I had an unrecognized IP address, and therefore it asked for a second 2FA. I thought this was odd but just an extra security measure from Binance. It was 5 minutes after the initial attempt that I was finally able to log in and noticed the coins were sold and the BTC was gone. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:56:14
I always have 2FA enabled.

Yes, Google can at least prevent this happening in the future by blocking the site from their search results! This could happen to any newbie. I was a little less new (having used Coinbase for over a year and taken an online course for work about phishing) but I was so absent-minded I didn't suspect anything until immediately afterward.
