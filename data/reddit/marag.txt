I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that mining the coins is a very slow and costly process, so the companies that sell it have large resources. The more people want to buy it, the higher the cost. The wild fluctuations we've seen in recent days will be down to bigger investors piling large quantities of cash into the system and the steep falls will be a result of them selling and cashing out....

I think it's because their main hub is in Estonia and they aren't as quick as you would like...

Don't be too hard on yourself, no-one could have predicted the gains that happened after that. Everyone had their fingers on the sell button, even me. But because my investment was small, I decided that holding on wasn't too risky. I think that even if you buy now, there's still money to be made...Take care.

It's "worth" it, if there's money to be made....

It's more expensive with visa, but immediate. A bank wire could take days, which means you could lose out on rapid gains. I've always bought with credit card and seen after a few hours those costs are recovered..

You are absolutely right. For a crash to take place, a lot of holders will have to simultaneously sell their coins, that will trigger a chain reaction of smaller investors selling to limit the shrinking in their gains..

They obviously let their guard down after a surge in popularity due to Dreams closure.... The Germans are fond of making examples.....
