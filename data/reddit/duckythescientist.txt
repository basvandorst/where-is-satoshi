Your dot grid paper, what is the grid spacing? I couldn't find details on the site. I've been looking for metric graph/grid paper notebooks, but they are hard to find in the USA.

It does! I will probably buy one shortly.

How does BFL still manage to make money? Don't people do research before making a purchase? 
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:21:24
Where are the specs? Wattage, battery type, safety features, laser class...? They call it a laser pointer which, according to what I remember of US regulations, means it's no more than 5mW.

Heat pumps are actually much better per watt at heating, so it's still likely a waste of money. A standard heat pump has a coefficient of performance around 3 compared to a COP of 1 for a resistive heater (or BTC miner).

I'll check tomorrow, but this is what I remember from just last week. I made my first purchase from them and wanted a small amount. They didn't let me go very small.

I'm pretty sure that's a referral link to CoinChat ( Does this count as spam? 
Edit: I signed up for the website. My referral link matches the format of AIcoholLiX's link, so yes, it's a referral link. So yes, this is spam according to the sidebar.

You have provided me nothing to warrant giving you money.

I'm interested in the group buy, and I have a reasonable amount of experience with PCB design (so far only 2-layer and DC/IF, but my job has me designing 4-layer HF in the near future), circuitry, and microcontrollers. I'll definitely be looking into the chip specs for designing. Do we know if that info is released yet?

It's either lack of research, miner's fallacy, or a desire for anonymous BTC (which would be better bought with cash). I sold my jalapeño to a friend last week for $300. He made the offer and set the price. I didn't feel like looking a gift horse in the mouth to ask why he was buying it.

As far as I know, the algorithmic efficiency of SHA256 is not improved by quantum. Some algorithms are better, some aren't. Because of this, quantum computers wont mine any better than a comparatively fast traditional computer.

Bitcoin Paranoid is what I use. It doesn't have settable values for alarms, but it does have  percentage change alarms.

There would be, but this is very small scale right now. I got $0.75 from it.

That's a coincidence, not irony.

Please at least attempt research before asking questions. I see nearly this exact post at least once a week on here.

What program/script did you use to make the graphic? I tried getting a QR code a while back in a vector format, and my CAM software didn't know what to do with it.

I met a guy at a sex store that has a friend who mines. He didn't know much though. However, I have quite a few friends on campus (through the computer security club) that know at least as much as I do.

WOT marks this as a site with a poor reputation. I can't vouch for the validity of the site, but I do want to caution people. I'll boot up a VM and report back if I find anything. 
EDIT: I don't see anything bad, but I only have a light background in computer security.

I have some alpaca slippers and ohmygod are they amazing! I'd buy socks, but I have little use for them in Florida.

I'm curious as well. Is listentobitcoin legitimate again, or is it still owned by the guy who bought it? 
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:10:11
I'm pretty sure Coinbase only goes down to 0.1 BTC.

I can't believe BFL even lets Josh talk to people anymore. His post reminds me of the types of arguments I see over on @_date: 2013-11-05 20:16:13


 Maybe I'm not as verified as you or something. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:26:57
Do we have any actual evidence that BFL has been mining?

Sold mid $600s and regretting it. I keep losing money by playing the exchanges.

How does shipping factor into the prices? I'd be very interested in buying a few pounds if shipping didn't kill me. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 08:00:14
Hahahahaha! That was good for a laugh. The statistician in me is going to go cry now, though.

I'm as surprised as you that they take BTC. I can vouch for the quality of their filament. I have four spools of PLA from them (natural is my favorite).

Small world!

That's still really cool
