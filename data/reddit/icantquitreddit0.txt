Why do people push hardware wallets so hard? I understand it if you plan on spending your coins fairly often, but if you're not, how is it any safer than a paper wallet in a safe place (like a fire-proof safe and memorized)?

yeah good point, if I was rich I wouldn't all-in on something. I'm not though, and I'm therefore all-in on Bitcoin.

Nah it's all about EV. If you have positive EV it's not gambling.

Maybe, but that's not how he earned his wealth.
