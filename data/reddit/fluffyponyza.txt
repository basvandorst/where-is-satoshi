You wouldn't have to; you'd only need to check-in with your node at home every few minutes to see if there are any new outputs for you. Creating a transaction, and broadcasting it, can be done entirely on your phone.


I have a [tiny, A5-sized node that I'm working on]( It'll retail for ~$250, and will happily simultaneously run Bitcoin and Monero nodes for the next few years. If it's just Monero it'll probably run it for more than a few years. It uses 15W, on average, staying in sync with both Bitcoin and Monero, which means it'd cost you $4.50 a month to operate. I'm fairly certain that's less than your bank fees.


I run [the only Monero web-wallet in existence]( Our aim is to build the same base functionality into the Monero daemon, once [the Kovri router]( is more mature and can provide absolute privacy between mobile and home, which means users will literally be able to run their own web wallet. Trivially, and privately.


We're talking about a "device" for the home, something that you can stick in a corner next to your router. It doesn't get simpler than that.
@_date: 2016-08-13 07:55:39
Dude, get off that train. You're embarrassing yourself.
Yes, there are elements of the Monero community that want to "pump" the price, but the vast majority of them [actively discourage people from buying Monero]( In fact, some have even [taken umbrage with my strong discouragement to people that think Monero will make them any sort of profit]( That's quite the opposite of "pumping", wouldn't you agree?
Even who you seem to single out for criticism, reiterated a few days ago that [Monero is not an investment to him]( which seems at odds with your claims. Yes, he's posted other stuff that is considerably more "pro-Monero", but that is simply because *he believes in the long-term viability of the Monero project* - and you should too!
Why? Well, remember that Monero is more than just a cryptocurrency, there are pro-privacy projects that are falling into the Monero umbrella. Your commentary is insulting and damaging to developers working on those projects. Take, for instance, [the Kovri i2p router project]( which is a lightweight, fast, easy-to-integrate i2p router that doesn't need the Java dependency that the main i2p router needs. This is an invaluable project in a world where Tor is becoming increasingly threatened and attacked in complex ways, including social and political attacks that may be unfixable.
Monero is literally laying the groundwork to provide private Internet services to people around the world, and you are disparaging and denigrating us for no reason. If you disagree with the comments of a handful of individuals then you are welcome to reply to those comments directly, but attacking a project that is doing its utmost to advance personal privacy for everyone is utterly deplorable.
@_date: 2016-08-13 18:37:50


That's entirely untrue. Were it true, then open-source projects wouldn't exist, Wikipedia would be a void, and nobody would ever volunteer to improve someone else's situation.
I'll gladly admit that there are a lot of scammers and idiots that are in the "blockchain" space, but at its core there are still a number of people, across a handful of projects, that are involved because they want to improve access to technology in order to enable people.
You are clearly not one of those people, and that is equal parts sad and pathetic.


What arguments? You haven't made any arguments in your OP, you just levelled insults.


I linked to several threads that had comments from community members, am I correct in assuming that you're conveniently disregarding those in order to support your point?


Then take it up with him; disparaging the community because you think one person doesn't make a compelling argument is just small-minded.


I made none of those arguments, yet you seem to position the rest of your comment as if I had.


Did you read my comment at all? I was talking about developers that work on things like Kovri, which have *nothing* to do with cryptocurrency. Is this a difficult concept for you to grasp, or are you just being purposely disingenuous?






Again - I'm talking about Kovri, a Monero project, not about Monero-the-cryptocurrency. I mean, I knew that reading comprehension was a dying skill, but I didn't know that it was so bad that people only grasped every fourth sentence.


Have you read your OP? There were no "specific questions" about Monero's viability, there were just insulting hypothetical future conversations. If you're going to ask "specific questions" then stop being a child and ask them.


Au contraire, I challenged the way you were insulting the project and the contributors that work on things like Kovri.


There's no subject change. You were unnecessarily insulting and disparaging, and I challenged that. You're the one suddenly acting like you'd seriously asked about Monero, when that is patently untrue.


Nonsense, I responded to *what you wrote*. If you wanted to have a serious conversation then you could've written a serious comment. If you wanted a reply from me you could've tagged me in it. You did none of the above, and then you dare to say *I'm* attempting a distraction? C'mon, guy.


Yes - I'm scared that you might waste another minute of my precious time, when I have far more important things to do on a Saturday night.

It's the difference between a fungible currency, and one that isn't. Having it at a protocol level gives users plausible deniability, and removes the concept of "taint" entirely.


There's definitely a significant impact for on-chain privacy. Monero's average transaction size is 3x-5x larger than Bitcoin's, and once everyone is using RingCT (obscures transaction amounts) next year it'll be even larger than that. It's an unavoidable cost of privacy, much as downloading Torrents will use significantly more bandwidth than if you were downloading from a centralised server (assuming you're not a gigantic douchenozzle who caps upload bandwidth whilst downloading).
That said, something like TumbleBit is promising because it provides off-chain mixing, which means it could (ostensibly) be tied into Lightning Network, reducing the cost impact.


What if I want to unmask transactions to an auditor? I don't want the whole world to know my transactions, just the auditor. Same goes for a company who wants the accounts department to be able to view the actual details of transactions, but not rival companies.

If it's not mandatory it won't be used. Even worse - the average customer will think that their transaction is magically private, when it isn't. Mandatory privacy prevents a problem that no amount of training can prevent.
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:21:34
Oh, absolutely - the goal has always been to make Monero useful, and usable. But it has to be done in a way that secures and defends our users, who will (most likely) not practice good opsec. So that might mean curtailing some of the usability in lieu of better privacy-protecting systems, and that's something worth considering as a counterpoint.
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:37:34
Per [MRL-0004]( the Monero Research Lab's recommendation is for us to increase it again next year. However, the advent of [RingCT (see MRL-0005)]( means that outputs no longer have to be denominated for mixing, which in turn necessitates increasing the minimum to make up for that.
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:01:29
All that lightweight wallets have done for Bitcoin is reduce the number of participating nodes, and made people think that creating a Bitcoin wallet is like registering on Facebook.

Monero "fanboys" form what is probably the most pragmatic community I've seen. There's very little blind defence from them, and I've been [quite outspoken about Monero's most likely outcome being failure](
PS. Since you at least seem to respect Andrew Poelstra, here are [his thoughts on Monero](
@_date: 2016-08-31 05:06:28
Mandatory privacy doesn't mean that individuals *can't* reveal their transactions. Monero, for example, provides this functionality both as a view key (where someone can reveal their entire account) or as a tx key (where someone can reveal a specific transaction).
Most importantly, though, mandatory privacy means that my opsec is not dependent on someone else's opsec. If you don't have mandatory privacy the opposite becomes true, and no about of MimbleTumblePuffing is going to prevent me from having my privacy compromised by the supermarket where I buy milk.
Forward secrecy is a thing for a reason.
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:49:33
No, he's 100% correct - the txoset in Monero is unbounded. You *used to* be able to tell if a txo was spent at mixin 0, but we hard forced a consensus ban of mixin 0 transactions earlier this year (per [the recommendation in MRL-0004](
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:53:08
There is no model - it's an unfunded, open-source project. If someone comes along tomorrow and figures out how to feasibly produce an SPV-style wallet, and rolls it out, people will use it. Nobody needs my permission, or anyone else's, to improve Monero and make it usable.
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:38:18
If it's not mandated in the protocol, no. I hope and wish that this becomes mandatory and the only way to transact with Bitcoin, but I'm 99% certain it won't be.

No, I'm saying that empowering users to *SAFELY* be in control of their funds is the eventual goal. The form that takes remains to be seen.
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:44:06
The number of people using web wallets will tend towards zero as people get their funds stolen, and realise they're massively unsafe.
At the same time, the number of people willing to spend some money to access a massively private, completely untouchable, uncensored, uncontrollable, decentralised store of value and medium of exchange, will tend to increase.
Consider this, too: it took YEARS before someone got Tor running on iOS, and then it was for jailbroken phones only. It is only more recently that it became possible to just fire up the App Store and download a Tor-capable browser. It is entirely possible to run a full Monero node on ARM devices right now, and running a pruned node on your phone is definitely plausible. In a couple of years time, as processing efficiency and battery capacity increases, I see no reason why you can't just run a pruned node on your phone instead of needing to offload processing.

That's like saying that we shouldn't store hashed passwords because a break in the cryptography could allow an attacker to trivially brute-force all of the passwords, so it's better to store them as plain text and let users choose if they want to hash their password and what hashing algorithm they want.

If you click the + next to an input you can see all the possible blocks that it could've come from. There's no way to tell which is the *real* signer, though.
Similarly, if you look at the "address" that outputs are going to, you'll see that it's not a Monero address, and is seemingly random. You can't even tell which outputs are being paid to the same address, or if they're all going to different addresses.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:16:16
That's both offensive and very untrue. If the work we've done with Monero results in Bitcoin gaining greater privacy *we will have succeeded in every possible way*. Monero users aren't out to make Monero increase in value, they're out to ensure that privacy is a default and not merely an option. It's no wonder, then, that the larger portion of Monero supporters are "Bitcoin maximalists".

Why are we as a community so ready to throw money at people who have no obligation to even prove the soundness of their idea, much less their ability to successfully manage large development teams?
And why do we couch all of this under the guise of "sticking it to the system" without giving a thought to *why the system exists*? I'm not saying the system isn't broken, and I'm certainly not saying that people can't conduct business and raise funds under a pseudonym or that they even need to have a company legally registered in some jurisdiction, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be demanding lots and lots of detailed information from anyone trying to raise money.
Trust me, I've been on the receiving end of trying to raise money, where people asked lots of very hard questions and I had to provide information that was as detailed as possible. And still the entire process was beset with trolls and FUD from one or two people that had it out for me, which lead to my business partners / colleagues deciding we should raise funds privately rather than do any sort of public fundraiser.

@_date: 2016-08-31 08:51:19
Your analogy is even more on point, let's run with it and I'll explain.
Virtually everyone on earth has no idea how to evaluate good cryptography or the security properties of decentralised systems. We know this because of the rise and popularity of thousands of poorly thought out altcoins, with incredibly broken designs and even worse implementations.
If we made passwords stored in the clear by default, but gave users a choice of optional hashing algorithm, the vast majority would simply not use it. Those that *did* want to use a hashing algorithm would have no idea which one to choose, and would do precious little research. They'd rely on poorly researched news articles, or would listen to the loudest voices online, and ultimately would end up using something broken or weak. Even worse - they could end up choosing an algorithm purposely broken by a nation state or a sophisticated attacker, but they'd be lulled into a false sense of security.
If you're going to argue for "genetic diversity" then are you also arguing that all users should be able to select their own block size limit? Or how about all users can select the total coin emission? Or maybe they can individually select from a wide range of PoW algorithms?
The fact of the matter is that a system has to have design decisions. These design decisions can be changed if necessary (eg. see the block size debate right now), and they certainly can be changed in an emergency. For example: Bitcoin's elliptic curve is secp256k1. There is evidence that this curve is compromised (see [SafeCurves, by Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange]( At some point these theoretical EC breaks may prove to be practical, or worse - may have purposely been put there during the curve's design - and Bitcoin will have to hard fork to a different curve to fix it, or else Bitcoin will be done for.
Similarly, a decentralised security system that provides mandatory privacy will have to hard fork in a change if there is ever a risk of the "entire castle" coming down.

@_date: 2015-12-08 09:53:02


In my unqualified opinion, yes, absolutely. What we've done with Monero, for instance, is to acknowledge that we don't know who runs nodes, and so for the next few years (at least) we're going to have a code freeze every 6 months for a hard fork that happens 6 months after that freeze, even if the only change we're making is to bump the block version number.
BUT Monero is also a tiny, currently irrelevant cryptocurrency with only a small userbase and a minuscule market cap, so we can afford to do that. Bitcoin has to tread more carefully, and if regular hard forks aren't ingrained in the system then you need to find clever ways of maintaining participants for as long as possible.

Contrariwise, it means that Bitcoin can't easily pivot to meet changing expectations and norms. It can't even easily tackle a breaking issue except by an emergency fork that drops those old peers that we're so desperately trying to protect.
In the absence of mathematical proof that one approach is better than the other I simply can't accept the trade-offs as being superior. That's not to say that Bitcoin won't succeed, I'm hoping it will, but it's naive to pretend that it's the best at everything and every bug is a feature.

It's quite a bit less "anonymous", as it makes no attempt to hide the "metadata". So it hides the transaction amount, but you don't have untraceability (what refers to as "shaping the transaction graph"). The upshot of doing so is that it allows for pruning, which is a good thing. Currently if we had to enable pruning with Monero you'd need to retain the *entire* txoset (since there is no distinction for utxos, at least not once we've banned mixin 0 transactions) and the *entire* key image set. Whilst this pruning is quite aggressive, it's nowhere near as aggressive as the pruning available with Bitcoin (and, by extension, with this sidechain). We (nor anyone else) have been unable to come up with a scheme that allows both.
Maybe put differently: this can enhance Bitcoin's privacy, effectively ending the raison d'être for certain altcoins forked from Bitcoin desperately trying to wedge "anonymity" into it, but it cannot magically make Bitcoin fungible. The implementation (as a sidechain) still faces many unique challenges.
That said, I welcome this, and I think anything that can enhance Bitcoin's privacy is advantageous. I'm also a massive fan of the work that andytoshi, gmaxwell, and the Blockstream developers are doing, and I'm sure they will continue to enhance this functionality:)

How so? If you're going to make such a grossly incorrect statement then it behooves you to qualify it with an elaboration or two. At the very least Monero provides a platform whereby things that can't or probably won't be done in Bitcoin can be experimented with (eg. our tail emission to retain mining incentives, or our [6-month rolling hard fork window]( We get along very well with the Bitcoin core maintainers, and we often exchange ideas and discuss what we're doing and why.
Additionally, Monero is a proving ground for things that *could* be implemented in Bitcoin, such as Curve25519 (over the current secp256k1) or the dynamically adjusting block size limit. Having data on how our block size limit reacted to pressure has been invaluable to the Bitcoin core maintainers as they look at the options available with Bitcoin's block size.
Also, Monero has directly led to the creation of things like [OpenAlias]( which directly benefits Bitcoin. OpenAlias has been implemented in Bitcoin wallets such as [Electrum]( and [Coin.Space]( That project would not exist were it not for Monero.


Ring signatures are one small part of Monero. Additionally, a lot of the value in experimentation is lost if we are pegged to Bitcoin. What works for a sidechain may not work for mainchain.


I'm confused - are you talking about the Monero core team, or the contributors to the Monero codebase? If you're talking about the core team, you are 100% right - we are just stewards, and we weren't looking to launch an altcoin. However, you're also 100% wrong that we "aren't real crypto devs" or that we "couldn't code a new coin from scratch", because one of the Monero core team members is tacotime, who you may remember from this: 
You're also grossly misstaken if you think that we're just "caretakers". Not only has Monero led to us creating things that benefit Bitcoin, as mentioned above, but Monero core is vastly different from the mess we inherited. The original CryptoNote reference code, at the point when we took over, had 17 112 lines that were comments, but that was mostly license headers. Monero core now has 72 573 lines of comments. Similarly, the original CryptoNote reference had 73 576 lines of code, whereas Monero now has 248 271 lines of code.
Lastly, the research put out by [the Monero Research Lab]( including practical things like [an Ed25519 reference implementation with the additional bits Monero requires]( speaks to our collective cryptography knowledge.
Our research goals, part of our [design and development goals]( include a great deal of sidechain / daughter-chain work that can only benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem.


I actually don't disagree with you here. Monero isn't wildly popular, and it's not trying to be wildly popular. If we can be a proving ground for things that are eventually done in Bitcoin, then Monero will have been a success. Similarly, if we can create something that is useful and usable, that too will mean Monero is a success. Popularity, price, market cap, or any other metric is largely irrelevant - Bitcoin has the market and the network effect, and that isn't going to change (nor is it at all threatened by Monero).
I also agree that this exists in an easily manipulated market, precisely because it is such a small market. There's not much we can do about that. We can't stop people from trying to pump up the price and so on, but we can (and we have) divorced ourselves from the price.
I do, however, disagree that Monero is only useful for people looking to buy drugs. I recently spoke on the matter of privacy and Monero at Bitcoinference ([video here]( and I go into some detail as to why privacy and fungibility are so important.

That traceable history is precisely the property that destroys Bitcoin's fungibility. Let me use a practical example.
Suppose you and I agree to swap 1 BTC. You send me your 1 BTC and I send you mine. So far the Bitcoin in this example appear to be fungible. However, let's say that afterwards you go deposit the 1 BTC on BTC-e, and they [immediately suspend your account because they've received a report that the Bitcoins were stolen]( Now suddenly this becomes a little tricky, because the 1 BTC I gave you clearly does not have the same "value" (to you) as the 1 BTC you gave me.
The traditional way of explaining fungibility is an example of cash vs. cars. If we agreed to swap $10, would you care if I gave you two $5 notes? Or one $10? Or a bunch of $1 notes? No, you wouldn't. But if you lent me your car, would you care if I returned a different car to you (maybe even the same make and model)? Yes, because a car is personal.

For physical storefronts the cost is huge - extra terminals or PoS modifications, managers need to know how to accept / process / refund this confusing new thing, waiters need to be made aware of it, etc. A single change/incident can make it too frustrating to keep.
Online stores have less of an impact on the software side, but a greater impact for support staff and the people processing refunds. Similarly, an upgrade to a newer version of the ecommerce software they're using (or a complete change) can break the Bitcoin processing plugin they have, and unless they are terribly motivated they won't put in the effort to fix that.

This was already discussed today:
    [15:06:32]  &lt;gmaxwell&gt;	waxwing: coinjoin is quite weak in practice and annoying to use (so it isn't used more universally) due to the amount non-privacy.
    [15:07:42]  &lt;gmaxwell&gt;	Also, realize that we have a very weird way of looking at this in bitcoin:  Transaction graph privacy is metadata privacy; indeed metadata privacy is important, but its fundimentally harder than content privacy (often impossible to be completely metadata private), and often less valuable than content privacy.
    [15:08:19]  &lt;gmaxwell&gt;	I think both would be used, it's specifically design to work with coinjoin (and the rpc interfaces in elements should be all setup for someone to build a coinjoiner on top)
I agree with the above statements, and I don't think that CoinJoin sufficiently masks the "metadata" (or is easy enough to use). That said, this is clearly a massive improvement over anything that has been done for Bitcoin privacy thus far, and is pretty amazing.

Really? Merchant adoption has done very little for Bitcoin, because there aren't enough people earning Bitcoin. I'm finding more and more physical merchants that are abandoning Bitcoin because nearly nobody is using it. Online merchants are slightly better, but even there...
Also, we've made zero effort to encourage merchant adoption, which makes sense given that Monero's RPC calls are completely different from Bitcoin's. Instead we are just fine with encouraging the userbase to use things like ShapeShift and xmr.to *to make payments to Bitcoin-accepting merchants*. The merchant shouldn't need to care about Monero or even know about its existence if they already accept Bitcoin.


Your argument here seems to be predicated on Monero being a scam, unless I'm misunderstanding? That doesn't make sense; Monero has no artificial scarcity (we have infinite supply) so it's unlikely the price will ever go up massively, and it has no premine or instamine. The contributors and developers were not the ones that created and launched it (much like Bitcoin), which means that we cannot be driven by massive profit incentives (in terms of Monero itself, we absolutely can be driven by profit incentives when it comes to building out parts of the greater cryptocurrency ecosystem).
I also don't think that the damage that altcoin scams do is anything CLOSE to the damage that Bitcoin scams do. It's very disingenuous of you to decry Litecoin and Bytecoin when there are a large number of people that think Bitcoin is a Japanese scam that went bankrupt because of it's corrupt French CEO. Nobody outside of a small circlejerky altcoin community even know about major scams like Pandacoin or Auroracoin.


Bitcoin's core development is naturally averse to that, because most changes nowadays are politicised, discussed ad infinitum, and go through the ringer. Your black/white view of the matter also negates the contributions of hundreds of people to third-party clients, automated tools, libraries, services, and so on, all the effort of which could (arguably) be better spent on Bitcoin core or sidechains. You should probably go shout at all the people wasting time on these other projects - how dare they, when they should be contributing to Bitcoin core!


Because running an altcoin requires a lot of effort and community buy-in. Nonetheless, I'd like to quote views [on the matter]( -
"Here are a few of the ideas which I think would be most interesting to see in an altcoin. A few of these things may be possible as hardforking changes in Bitcoin too but some represent different security and economic tradeoffs and I don't think those could be ethically imposed on Bitcoin even if a simple majority of users wanted them (as they'd be forced onto the people who don't want them)."


You're falling prey to the "no true Scotsman" fallacy. There's a huge limitation to "true experimentation", per your stringent definition, in that it'll never truly be real-world tested. Experimentation in the confines of a lab is easy, but what's the point? Deploying it in a limited real-world situation is equally pointless. In cryptographic models we start by assuming that an attacker is overpowered on some level, like they have unlimited time or they can decrypt our encrypted text at will. Thus, in order for a cryptographic experiment's results to be useful, it has to (by definition) be in an environment where a motivated attacker is actually going to attack it. This necessitates getting a "higher rank on coinmarketcap", as you so blithely put it, otherwise what motivation is there for a skilled attacker?
Even without needing a motivated attacker, some experiments require both time and a community that is heavily invested. Let me use a practical example. When Bitcoin's block reward drops below the fees in a block there is some consternation as to what will happen. Will miners be unable to sustain their operation? Will there be ASICs in tons of appliances and so it doesn't really matter? We don't know. But between now and then there is an experiment taking place in Monero, with our minimum block reward. That minimum block reward will kick in around May, 2022, and will provide useful data for comparison for when Bitcoin enters that insignificant reward phase. Perhaps that data may even illicit a change in Bitcoin's reward scheme (not to infinite supply, but perhaps to a recycled supply, per ThomasV's recent suggestion on the mailing list). But if it's just a handful of miners for a worthless "experiment", and they aren't really invested in mining Monero, of what value is the experiment? They won't really be representative of anything, and it will have been a waste.


You're contradicting yourself. And even so - what is your conclusion based on? You're doing that thing (again) where you make unqualified statements with no elaboration.


No matter, it was just the MC2 whitepaper.


Have you asked me if I am contributing to anything other than Monero / OpenAlias? Do you know anything about me or my businesses or my startups or my contributions to open source projects? Do you know anything about the other 6 members of the Monero core team and their projects / contributions to Bitcoin?
I honestly am gobsmacked that you can make such a baseless statement with so little information.


The problem is that you view Monero as "competition". It's not. Bitcoin has "won" by a mile. Monero is not taking anything away from Bitcoin. At best Monero would be a compliment to Bitcoin, not a replacement, not competition, not anything of the sort.

My comment said I was focusing on cryptocurrency related endeavours, the day-to-day management of the other companies has long since been palmed off, and I've taken a further step back by handing off operational control to a different board member. Our cryptocurrency businesses make up around 3% of the group revenue, and around 4% of the EBITDA of the group.
So if all cryptocurrencies evaporated overnight we would be left bag-holding with assets we can sell as well as a few assets that are effectively worthless in an evaporated market. However, the handful of functions performed by full-time employees (as opposed to group-level employees that handle many functions such as support, finances, logistics, administration, and so on) are typical startup employees - innovative, multi-skilled, multi-roled - they can be re-deployed within the group.
My salary is fixed and would not change regardless of positive or negative press. The only thing that would change is (by a few %) are my bonus cheques, which are based on net profit. Additionally, we don't have holdings in Bitcoin (we process payments through BitPay and by and large have them pay us in ZAR and not BTC), and I am not adding to my small cold wallet anytime soon, so market movement doesn't affect my assets or the group's assets.

I really didn't think I needed to clarify the difference between a full client and an Electrum-style client. Clearly I was talking about a full client.
The fact that a thin client is hitting a remote service and not rebroadcasting locally is an important distinction, sure, but in the context of this thread it's one of semantics. The point is that your mobile device is *capable* of running a full client (that you choose not to is irrelevant), and so Apple has to make a decision based on that scenario.
I can find NO reference to FinCEN's guidance on that - only that they have stated that they will not regulate users (at this juncture). Again, I'm just pointing out that until the regulatory environment is not completely clear (ala GrooveShark, which Apple blocked despite them not being technically illegal at the time and having only had a handful of court cases) and that it is of a completely different nature than Google Wallet and/or PayPal.

[Apple's role has now been cleared up]( A few choice points:
"Early reports of the DROPOUTJEEP program made it appear as if every iPhone user was vulnerable to this — which simply can’t be the case. Physical access to a device was required which would preclude the NSA from simply ‘flipping a switch’ to snoop on any user. And Apple patches security holes with every version of iOS. The high adoption rate of new versions of iOS also means that those patches are delivered to users very quickly and on a large scale."
"Applebaum’s talk at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress walked listeners through a variety of the programs including DROPOUTJEEP. He noted that the claims detailed in the slide indicated that either Apple was working with the NSA to give them a backdoor, or the NSA was just leveraging software vulnerabilities to create its own access. The Apple statement appears to clear that up — pointing to vulnerabilities in older versions of iOS that have likely since been corrected."
"Most recently, Apple joined AOL, Yahoo, Twitter, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google and Facebook in requesting global government surveillance reform with an open letter. Though the NSA is located in the United States and these programs were largely designed to target ‘foreign threats’, these companies have a global customer base — making protecting user privacy abroad as well as at home just as important."

And yet many people hate those barriers to entry and want to invest (read: lose) money by throwing it at the dodgiest listings on the dodgiest "exchanges" because they think they'll make money in an unregulated environment. And they *complain* about MPEX's barriers to entry! There are truly no limits to human greed.

I'd like to point out that I have had MAJOR issues with BitPay being unavailable when customers want to pay. Given that ALL of our costs are in fiat currency, I can't afford to accept BTC directly. When BitPay's API errors out (which happens surprisingly often) it's bad for my business - and even worse, I don't always know it's down, because they send no pre-emptive notifications. And these issues occur constantly even though only 4% of our payments are BitPay.
On the other hand, I've had zero issues with PayPal, even though they account for 96% of our payments.
Whether I'll move from BitPay to Coinbase at some stage remains to be seen (and I'm not sure if they support disbursements into South African bank accounts), but I'm just saying that payment processors, regardless of the currency they accept, all have issues and nuances.

BUT you could do delta balances and then just do lock-sum-update every 15 minutes to reduce the number of rows that have to be parsed to get a "current" balance to only what has transpired over the past few minutes. Your transaction table would never exceed more than a few million rows, and balances can be summed and the table truncated whilst a lock is on it (under a second for a reasonably sized TP cluster).

@_date: 2014-01-13 11:34:22
I disagree with you. I have this model for security that is really simple: inconvenience (and security) should scale with the level of the transaction.
For example - want to send $10 worth of Bitcoin to a friend right now when you've done no other transactions today? Easy - just your password. Want to keep sending $10 till you hit X number of transactions in an hour or Y amount in an hour? Now we need your password and 2FA. Want to send more than, say, $20k worth of BTC in a day? Now we need your password, 2FA, and for you to answer a security question.
There's no reason this concept can't be rolled into Bitcoin just like BIP-38.

Bitpay supports 100% payments to a Bitcoin address, so you keep the convenience of the button while still having it swept to your wallet. The fees are tiny, it's not a bad deal.
If you don't have a wallet yet, I highly recommend [Electrum]( The first time you start it up it gives you a 12 word seed (write it down), and that is literally all you ever need to back up. If your computer crashes or your house explodes all you need is those 12 words and you can restore. You can write it in the margin of a book, email it to yourself as a poem, whatever, and nobody will realise that you have your private key hidden there except you:)

I disagree that all of those need a root exploit. An app that can read your SMS messages or emails can compromise 2FA that use those channels, for example. A malicious custom keyboard can capture your password. [Some apps]( "require" rooting, [some apps]( require you to "run a small app on your computer to enable" functionality.
The truth is the landscape is shifting so rapidly, and there are so many ways to blow out the sandbox *as long as you convince the user to buy in*. Saying "it isn't possible" is a cop-out when the weakest link, unwitting user stupidity, makes so much possible.
We're also at a point where there is so much crud and rubbish on the Play Store that, truthfully, it's impossible to determine how many apps are malware in disguise waiting for an activation code. I mean, if apps masking secret functionality can slip in to Apple's walled garden, I don't even want to THINK about how many apps have been deployed to the Play Store to just accumulate users before having their bad side triggered.

As somebody who is born and raised in Africa (and still lives here!), is well travelled across the continent, and has family who live in Botswana: nope, not at all. The infrastructure is simply not there to support it. However, remittance services such as BitPesa will likely find a nice fat niche for themselves.
For the foreseeable future in Africa (10-20 years), cash is king, and the unbanked will want to stay unbanked. This constant Botswana bantering is cute, but it's destined to go the way of OLPC: lots of fluff and fuss, but ultimately signifying nothing for the continent or most of its denizens.
It would probably be more useful if her efforts were focused on building an actual service based on Bitcoin that is both useful and easily adopted (USSD is still massive here) than doing the constant press drone.

1. It is definitely more geared towards the tech-savvy at the moment. Bitcoin addresses are long and weird! But there are services that are built on top of Bitcoin that are seeking to address that:)
2. I would posit that few people know the "creator" of Firefox, although they may realise it's attributed to the Mozilla Foundation. Someone, or perhaps even a group of people, came up with the *idea* and wrote the very initial version of the software. That has long since been superseded, in many ways, by constant improvement and by the hard work of many developers contributing to the Bitcoin open source project (in much the same way as developers contribute to Firefox). Similarly, just as the Mozilla Foundation guide the direction of Firefox and other Mozilla projects, the Bitcoin Foundation guides Bitcoin. That notwithstanding, just like Firefox (the software) could easily be decoupled from the Mozilla Foundation, Bitcoin as a piece of software can be decoupled from the foundation.
3. Anonymity is a feature, sure. To speak to your last point: you'd go to some measure to protect your cash - but it in a fireproof safe, or hide it under your mattress or something. You wouldn't leave it lying around. Bitcoin requires the same measure of protection, too, but software like Electrum makes it easy, as Electrum gives you a 12 word deterministic key when you first start it up, and you can write that key down and put it in the aforementioned safe/mattress.
4. I'm quite active on and (both of which are frequented by preppers). I'm not sure if Bitcoin has any appeal to them. I can definitely see it having appeal to the anarcho-libertarian/tinfoil hat crowd, but that appeal is hinged more on them being able to use it on a regular basis without the guv'mint seeing what they're buyin'.
5. Whilst others have touched on various reasons below (transaction permanence being one of the major positive points), it is currently by far the cheapest way of sending money overseas bar none. If you ever shop on sites that send things from overseas you may find more and more of them offering discounts when paying in Bitcoin as they see the lower costs when accepting it.

You really are an idiot, cubby. If I speak with authority it's because I'm paraphrasing conversations that are public knowledge if you bother to seek the information out.


No, [the Tor Project is perfectly capable of talking for themselves]( and so when I said "the Tor Project don't want to ask for it" (a CA / Browser forum exception for .onion) it was a paraphrase of that blog post where Roger Dingledine said "if one site gets a cert, it will further reinforce to users that it's "needed", and then the users will start asking other sites why they don't have one. I worry about starting a trend where you need to pay Digicert money to have a hidden service or your users think it's sketchy."


No, this is again [a conversation that is well known and public]( So when I said that the Tor Project "would have to formally request that the CA / Browser Forum change their guidelines" it was as a result of actually having read that thread, and paraphrasing (for instance) [Adam Langley when he said]( "I still think that the Tor project should be invited to voice their opinion however. I'll go point some people at this thread." and then when they were not forthcoming [Adam subsequently concluded]( "without Tor fighting for it I'm not sure that there's much hope."


And again I get to show you up in public and demonstrate your utter incompetence - this is really getting rather fun! [Facebook have a nice blog post on the subject]( on the subject, so when I said that "their acquisition of an SSL cert is secondary to [their generating a memorable / recognisable Tor name], not in lieu of it" I'm merely paraphrasing what they themselves have outrightly stated when they said: "we decided to use SSL atop this service due in part to architectural considerations - for example, we use the Tor daemon as a reverse proxy into a load balancer and Facebook traffic requires the protection of SSL over that link."
Oh. Snap.
Also, real, actual infosec people like Ian Carroll have written very recent blog posts [indicating why TLS over Tor is useless]( - you'd do well to educate yourself before talking. "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt", isn't it?
Seriously, why would deal with somebody that misses such fundamental infosec premises is quite beyond me. It appears that all you need to self-identify as an infosec "expert" nowadays is a blog and an opinion. The industry has really gone downhill.

My sister and brother-in-law have the largest swimming school in Gabs. I designed their website for them. My parents lived in Ghanzi doing volunteer work for years. Even if we disregard Zim, Malawi, Zambia, Nigeria, Kenya, the DRC, and other places and focus solely on Bots, I can assure you that it is not ready for Bitcoin.
It may be ready for systems built on top of the protocol, but it is not ready for Bitcoin.
When was the last time you needed something - say you wanted to rent a 3-bedroom house in Maun? Now in a developed country, even in South Africa, you can get on Gumtree and search. Have you seen how undeveloped Botswana's Internet presence is? I have. There are basic systems that people need to become familiar with, even reliant on, that can translate into a basic understanding of information security. Without that, how can they be expected to keep their money secure? You will push, you will get some on-board, and then the thefts will start. People will distrust Bitcoin, and they will distrust you. They will find a stack of Pula under their mattress safer, because they know where their money is.
Botswana also doesn't bleed enough to neighbouring countries to make it interesting as a cross-border transactional system. Now Malawi and Zimbabwe, on the other hand, have a ton of people that have come to South Africa for work. Could Bitcoin be useful to them for sending money back to their families? Sure, but again - the first few thefts and you'll have a complete reversion on your hands.
Throwing cheap Chinese smartphones at the problem isn't a solution. You want something that has the reach of M-Pesa's agent network, the ease-of-use and accessibility of SMS, and the security of Apple's Touch-ID. In other words, you need cheap Chinese smartphones that are at least 3 or 4 generations away.
You also need to capture the attention of the public. Nedbank and Vodacom have been pushing M-Pesa in South Africa for YEARS. They have spent millions upon millions of Rands on advertising. They have tried to innovate and reinvent, and all it's gotten them is failure. 2000 merchants, many of whom have never had a single M-Pesa customer. Removal of M-Pesa support from Nedbank ATMs in December. A few hundred thousand registered customers with only a small percentage of active users.
All this goes to prove that Africa *is not ready for Bitcoin right now*. There will be a push amongst the Twitterati of Cape Town, and amongst the entrepreneurial crowd in Africa, but all of that will be fail due to a lack of usability, ill-equipped hardware, apathy amongst the general public, and distrust when the thefts roll in. Africa is not ready for Bitcoin, not now. Maybe in 5-10 years. Maybe.

The security question is easy though - it's merely implemented as a (short) password that to unlock a 2nd privkey.
You can already implement 2FA, of a sort, using 2-of-2 or 2-of-3 multi-sig transactions:  - since the implementation would mean "device 1 broadcasts transaction, device 2 broadcasts the 2nd signature to confirm it" there wouldn't be any rolling code. Having a second device confirming a transaction is still, by its definition, 2FA - the 2nd signature is the 2-factor-auth:)
Since BIP 10 (multi-sig transaction broadcast), BIP 11 (M-of-N transactions), and BIP 16 (pay to script hash) have all been part of the Bitcoin core for years (BIP 16 was implemented April, 2012) no hard fork would be needed to implement the above. The reference client, and all related clients, would merely need to enforce BIP 11 transactions above a certain value, which certainly wouldn't require a hard fork - those running old clients would just find their large transactions are rejected.

Unfortunately it'll only last till Nov 1 2015, and has to be revoked by October 2016, as the requirements from the CA / Browser Forum don't allow for certificates for "internal names" like .onion (under the guise of what-if-ICANN-approves-an-actual-.onion-TLD).
There was some talk of making an except for .onion domains, except there's one snag: the Tor Project don't want to ask for it, because SSL certificates for .onion addresses are redundant and unnecessary. Why? Because the Tor protocol / software *already* encrypts the traffic between the browser and the hidden service, and since the .onion address is a hash of the host's key the whole communication loop is authenticated. Thus, SSL certs for Tor are only handy when you leave via an exit node, which you wouldn't do for .onion addresses.
In short, the SSL cert is a cute marketing gimmick, but it's going to be revoked anyway and on the whole is unnecessary.

1. That's like arguing that Bitcoin's use of [a type safe printf replacement]( implies that the devs "couldn't even write their own replacement". Why reinvent the wheel when it is preferable to take an existing reference implementation and improve on it?
2. Now you're just being silly - it's an open-source project, and there are contributors who choose to contribute code, there's nothing wrong with that. Incidentally, I already [destroyed the "proof" in that thread]( and showed how Bytecoin have copied our commits and stripped their comments. So much for us just being a clone, eh.
3. We never said it does, and that is why we are working with i2p, i2pd, and Anoncoin (under the Privacy Solutions umbrella of which we are a founding member) to integrate i2p.
4. Nonsense, our blockchain is linearly larger than Bitcoin's, which is a trade-off effect of providing cryptographically unlinkable and untraceable transactions. Nonetheless, even if we match Bitcoin's transaction volume in a few years we will still have a blockchain that comfortably fits on consumer-grade storage.
5. It was an EXTREMELY obscure edge-case in a piece of badly written reference code we inherited that was attacked. The fork lasted 35 minutes after which the longest chain resolved. We [found the bug and patched it within 8 hours of the attack occurring]( We have since provided an additional patch that lets clients stuck on the dead side of the fork recover without needing to sync from scratch. We did this without needing to do any rollback.
6. Peter is absolutely right, a lot of the code we inherited from Bytecoin is crap. It's our job to turn that into a gem. We certainly aren't paying him as an advisor to whisper sweet nothings into our ears, but to help us turn a pile of garbage into a glittering diamond.
7. We have an extremely good idea. Again, that's not to say the code doesn't have other bugs lurking in it, but we have been and are continuing to audit it.
8. You're talking utter rubbish - dga, the guy with a PhD you're quoting, has confirmed before that we're pretty much at the upper bound of hashing efficiency in the code we have. He had an advantage for a brief period of time, and [he has clarified that article by stating the following]( - "Bytecoin was a scam, they crippled the miner, Monero inherited it when Monero was still "bitmonero", and it took a while before the Monero devs got the code fast by undoing the crap that Bytecoin had added.  During that time, I made some money.  After that time, I didn't.  That time has been over for a long time. To their credit, the Monero devs have always been up-front that there's a lot of work to be done with respect to auditing, both in cryptography and design, and in implementation, and they've made credible progress at doing so."
9. "Some rich dude" has no relationship with the core team, and he is entitled to buy and sell whatever he wants.

It's still the wrong approach for Tor, and nothing you've said changes that basic fact.
Firstly, you absolutely can register a company with a mule (guy on the street's name and ID number is all you need), and various countries have distinctly different levels of care when it comes to checking up on stuff like that.
Secondly, Facebook figure out ages ago that Tor is self-authenticating, and so they got a .onion address that is both memorable and easy to recall. It contains only 4 components in the URL - Facebook, core, www, and I. Their acquisition of an SSL cert is secondary to that, not in lieu of it. Blockchain and whichever infosec "expert" consulted with them on this clearly miss the point, and spent an inadequate amount of time understanding the root of the problem.
Finally, this SSL "solution" doesn't solve the problem right now - it maybe, possibly solves the problem in future when browsers are super aggressive about differentiating between cert types, but right now it's a half-baked attempt at solving a very real issue.

We bought some for my parents and my in-laws as a gift, and they are extremely pretty. I know you may think it an odd gift, but they all know I'm involved in Bitcoin, and for the price it seemed a nice thing to give them that could possibly pay for a renovation in a year (neither of them are the sort to HODL for long).
However, don't fool yourself, even though Titan BTC takes care to ensure none of their staff steal your privkey, you are still effectively entrusting your coins to a third party. They're great as a gift for the non-technical person who will never really get involved in Bitcoin, and going for the privkey version means not having to worry about their website still being operational in a year or two or ten.
Thus, you may want to sweep the coins to a cold wallet, and then include instructions in your will on returning it to them (in case something happens before they want to use it). I agree with that not everyone is out to scam you, but you never know how tempting something worth $500 today can be when it is worth $500 000.

I agree with your point about being vested in the ecosystem, but for me it's more than that. People complain about Apple reducing choice, but that's precisely what I want. I have a limited focal range, and I don't want to spend hours researching how to do something.
A typical example is backups. It took me many hours of configuring to get duplicity to work (via duply, eventually) for remote delta backups on my servers. Ran into all sorts of problems and eventually had to [patch duplicity myself]( because the LTS version of Ubuntu Server I run didn't get duplicity updates beyond 0.6.18.
On my Macbook I just found my NAS and told TimeMachine to use it. On my phone iCloud does my backups for me. I spend too much time building and managing and creating and administering that the mere thought of having to do that to my own devices makes me irritated. I switched away from Windows because I wanted less choice - I wanted to just slot in to a workflow, and everything must just work. Apple gives me that.

You raise a point on the hard fork - but that's part of the design. There was a hard fork in March 2013, and that didn't break anything spectacular?
You're not understanding 2-of-2 transactions. You sign the transaction on device 1 (a PC, for argument sake) using your Bitcoin client and indicating that a 2nd address (not part of device 1's wallet) has to counter-sign it. It is broadcast to the network, but is not considered a fully signed transaction. Device 2 co-signs that transaction (using the indicated address), and the network accepts the transaction as final. The two devices do NOT share a wallet or have any relation to each other *other than the one implied*.

Completely - I run several businesses in South Africa, many of which accept Bitcoin, and a handful of which are Bitcoin-centric. There IS a small groundswell among the techno-literate in South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya, and merchants and businesses are being encouraged to accept it.
What this means is that *when* Bitcoin is ready for the African masses, there will be a large group of early adopters who already use it (thus driving a top-down adoption methodology), as well as a string of merchants across the continent that will accept it. But that does not mean that we should be driving grass-roots adoption *right now*.
Let me give you an example. Let's imagine I know very little about Bitcoin apart from what I read in the news. But I'm in the target demographic for a grass-roots drive - 25-40, disposable income, etc. Now let's say my maid (domestic worker) comes to me and asks me to pay her wages in Bitcoin. There's no way it's happening - it's way too much effort for me!
But now let's say that in a few years my maid has places she can spend Bitcoin on essentials (bread, milk, transport, rent, electricity, cellular prepaid airtime etc.), and I ask her if I can pay her wages in Bitcoin. She hadn't previously considered it, she knows some of her friends get paid in Bitcoin and she knows where she can spend it, but it's never occurred to her. But now because I'm asking her she decides she can. She only works for me 3 days a week, so she'll still get paid some of her wages in ZAR, so the adoption curve is low-risk to her.
Bitcoin adoption in Africa is only ever going to happen top-down - from the techno-illuminated to their friends and family and eveeeeentually trickling down to the masses. In 5-10 years, when the hardware is in the hands of the masses, not sooner.

I think the distinction is that it's already been established that a browser is a dead terminal, it's not purpose-built. I keep going back to the example of GrooveShark - when Apple (and Google and Facebook) pulled their app from the store GrooveShark wasn't technically illegal. In fact, I still think it hasn't been established firmly. There were only a handful of court cases at the time, and I don't think they'd all even been resolved.
But because it was murky (GrooveShark works by letting users upload music to their service, thus "freeing" GrooveShark from regulatory incident) Apple decided to kill the app, but the HTML5 site continues (and the app has been released on Cydia for jailbroken phones).
I think the distinction between a "general purpose" app being abused for nefarious purposes and a specific, purpose-built app being abused for nefarious purposes is important. In much the same way: driving a car and having an accident doesn't, by default, make you a murderer (unless you were negligent), but walking around with a gun and shooting randomly at stuff until someone dies is very different. The end result may be the same, but the mechanism is important. I know it's a bad analogy, but it's 7:30am and I just woke up:-P

It's not patched, it's just [added a dialog box]( that a clever attacker will work around. For eg. an attacker will use 301 redirects to the actual blockchain.info site with a username in the URL and [let this dialog box pop up]( over and over and over again until the user is trained to automatically click the box away. Users have a tendency to just live with it (if nothing bad happens) rather than identify if there really is an issue. 6 months later they change the redirect to forward to a domain under their control, say bIockchain.info or bIockchain.in, and they walk away with sniffed access to accounts as users continue to bat the error message aside.

With the Monero project we also faced the challenge of not wanting to use the standard phpbb/vbb/ipb stuff, and given our long-term goals we felt it most prudent to write from scratch.
We paid for this out of our own pocket, total cost thus far has been about 37 Bitcoin (around $13 000). It began around the middle of June this year, and we launched the forum at the beginning of October, so total dev cycle of 3.5 months to launch.
We're still adding features (some major things like elastic search and private messaging), but we already incorporate a bunch of cool things like post weighting that decays over time and also based on your trust groups (up to a level 3 trust group).

As an African I can assure you that it pretty much doesn't. Legal precedent for something that has no established case law generally comes from Roman-Dutch law (upon which our legal system is based) and occasionally on UK case law. Financial policy is similar - a lot of policy here is radically different to the way the US does things because decisions made by the US rarely have major consequences for us. We are far more affected by EU policy and by changes in China.

Eugh, you're either being idiotic or purposely deceitful, which is anomalous for someone who pretends to know anything about infosec.
Firstly, the Tor project doesn't need to pay ICANN a cent for a CA exception, that wasn't what I said at all. Learn to read, cubby. I said that they would have to formally request that the CA / Browser Forum change their guidelines ([these ones]( to exempt .onion from being defined as "internal names". It has NOTHING to do with ICANN.
I never ONCE implied that SSL was not necessary, just that *it isn't necessary for Tor*.
Why? You answered it in your response without even knowing -


Here's the thing you seem to have completely missed: users are NEVER going to check whether the cert they're seeing is an EV cert, and even if they do they will NEVER check if it has the organisation they expect. Thus, the minute a CA issues domain validated certs for .onion domains the entire authentication aspect is worthless - and let's be frank, asking to differentiate between the types of certs at a user level is crazy talk. Real infosec people understand this, and realise that education at this level is better spent on helping users make sure they have the correct address than on looking for a magical green icon that can easily be bypassed the minute the first ten thousand certs are issued (trust me, I could easily register a South African company called Block Chain (Pty) Ltd and get an EV cert that no CA could legitimately deny).

I would hazard that Electrum doesn't fit in to this, as anyone can run an Electrum server and there are scores of them. Over and above the 14 default, hard-coded servers, more servers are discoverable via IRC ( on Freenode). Electra (a bot) automatically kicks servers from the channel that are not serving valid block headers. Currently there are 19 servers online (per my client).
In order for Electrum to be inaccessible it would require a combination of:
- all default Electrum servers offline or bad  
- additionally: all non-default Electrum servers offline or bad  
- alternatively (to the previous point) the whole of the Freenode network offline or Electra has gone rogue and kicked all Electrum servers off the channel
ThomasV is also working on an additional piece of functionality that will allow clients to validate block headers and find consensus themselves, so that will also reduce potential failure points.

I'm well aware of GW's limitations - again, nothing you've just said has any bearing on my comment. We all know that Bitcoin is currently susceptible to 51% attacks, whether by miner collusion or massive hardware control, and GBT is not the solution to that.
Whilst I respect Sunny King's work on Proof of Stake in PPC, it isn't a part of the core Bitcoin protocol (or even being seriously considered, as far as I know) and so it isn't a solution right now. It remains to be seen what the core developers eventually implement as a solution.

Nobody is going to look for an EV cert, and you can BET that there will be CAs that will do domain validation only if it becomes a *thing*.
Also, remember that Tor addresses are self-authenticating by virtue of the address being cryptographically and inexorably linked to the host's private key.
The issue then is that the user needs to learn the correct Tor address to use, whether by offline methods (face-to-face referral) or external online methods (eg. their official Twitter feed). BUT: if the choice is to educate users to figure out what an EV cert is and how to identify that one is in place and confirm the organisation is correct and what they expect, OR to learn to find and identify the right Tor address for the destination, I think the latter is a better bet.

Just in case you think that SSL client-side certificates aren't a thing, they were used in BitPay's API in 2011. If you check the [API document for their v0.2 API]( it says: "The merchant’s system must use a client SSL certificate for authentication. Once an SSL certificate has been created, the SHA-1 fingerprint for the certificate must be set in the merchant account (on the order preferences page). The Bit-Pay system **will use the fingerprint of the client certificate to lookup the merchant account and authenticate the connection**. The merchant’s client key must remain private."

Many of the posts I've read in this thread have been incredibly puerile, please ignore them. You merely need a stock standard prenup - ANC with accrual. You declare your Bitcoin holdings as part of the ANC, and then only what you accrue from the moment you marry is considered "shared" between the two of you and would be split (down the middle, whatever, who cares). Any net worth you have when you enter into the marriage is yours and yours alone, and in the event of a divorce it cannot be touched as it is part of your earnings before you were married.

That doesn't make sense - there are 1101 "mobile wallet" apps on the app store, some more mobile wallet-y than others. At the very least, Ripple, Google Wallet, Square Wallet, and PayPal compete directly with their alleged payment system. Gyft and others are direct competition for Passbook. And many of the apps are tiny and (relatively) unknown - Isis Mobile, Visa QIWI, Venmo, hyperWALLET, FIS Mobile, Simplee Wallet. These are not apps that have massive customer bases - definitely nothing close to Blockchain's customer base.
All of those apps exist untouched and untethered, and Apple earns nothing from their existence except the $99 a year the company pays for their developer account. It literally costs Apple more than that to approve and keep those apps on the App Store. When you think about it, Google Wallet is the most direct competitor with iMoney (if it even comes to fruition as more than just a trademark registration) and is from Apple's arch-nemesis. If they were removing competition, that would be the first to go!
I mentioned this further up in this thread - I really do think this situation is more akin to Apple removing GrooveShark's app, which is still not technically illegal, just a bit dodgy. GrooveShark just countered that by creating an HTML5 app and releasing their regular app on Cydia for jailbroken phones...but if GrooveShark ever change their model and become legit, Apple will undoubtedly welcome them back on the app store.

At the moment there's nothing forthcoming from SARS (SA Revenue Service). SARB (SA Reserve Bank) normally issues something first around a new instrument or whatever, and then SARS bring tax policies in line with what SARB have declared it as. In this instance, [SARB has only officially "warned against the risks posed by cryptocurrency, Bitcoin – noting that it has no legal status or a regulatory framework"](
Practically this is FANTASTIC news for South African Bitcoin companies [like us]( especially on the mining side, as it means we only have to worry about output VAT to our suppliers, and fiat payouts from BitPay or from exchanging mined coins are just treated as income that we can declare appropriately. We can put as much of our profit into BTC as we want, and it remains untaxed and untouched *at this juncture*. We can even pay those profits out to shareholders (in BTC) and it again remains untaxed and untouched, and the company continues to break-even from a ZAR/fiat perspective (which is all that SARS cars about right now). This position may change in the future if Bitcoin is declared a foreign currency, but traditionally that sort of thing takes many years to play out.

It's COMPLETELY different. If your phone runs the PayPal app, it runs a client that connects to a server where all the transacting is done. With  Bitcoin, a client acts as a full node, rebroadcasting transactions. The device itself acts as more of a server than a client, and thus changes the dynamic substantially.

I think Arthur is just quoting stuff that BCG has said (it sounds like they've been in touch with him) about narrowing down likely candidates. I think the point he was trying to make is that Leah may have had a valid process in narrowing down candidates, but that she ignored evidence that pointed to Dorian *not* being Satoshi.
Also, it's exceedingly common for good developers to have an ivory tower complex, and with a mere glance at someone else's code they conclude that they could've done it better. I have managed teams of developers, and nearly every time where we picked up another company's project at a client my developers would categorically state that they "could've done better" and "we should just rewrite it". In the few instances where we rewrote it because "it's so simple" it was always a mess - final delivery months later than expected with less features than the previous iteration. Developers assertions in this regard are almost always incorrect;)
I highly doubt that Dorian would be so anti-government, so libertarian, that he would invent Bitcoin and then abandon it completely without so much as a small stash? I'm not talking about the very early blocks that were mined that have been credited to Satoshi, I'm talking about the mid-to-late-2010 period where difficulty was 17, rising to 14 500 at the end of the year - he could easily have CPU mined and kept the coins in flux so that they were seemingly unrelated to his identifiable stash. Instead, Dorian lives an incredibly simple life caring for his aged mother, and by Arthur's own admission he is not doing very well financially. All of this doesn't add up to the behaviour that could be expected from the "real" Satoshi.
Edit: just for fun, I calculated what he could've mined with a couple of CPUs in mid-2010. If he had enough crunching power for 2mh/s he would've mined 118 BTC a day in the middle of 2010, eventually going down to 1 BTC a week towards the end of 2010.

Ok, so here's info from [BulkSMS, who provide shortcode SMS services in South Africa]( Over and above the minimum volume requirements, setup fees, monthly admin fee, and so on, the important bit is this bullet point for a Dedicated Shortcode:
- Could be used as Standard Rated shortcode which does not generate revenue.
If you glance a little below that to the charge table, you'll see that the minimum charge you can levy a customer for a shortcode SMS is R1. I'll leave currency conversion to USD as an exercise for the reader, but it's about R10.73 to US $1, so just divide by 10 for rough estimates.
StatsSA publishes various statistics on employment in South Africa, but perhaps [this report from 2010]( is the most recently comprehensive. Section 2 (Highlights of the results) on page vii has a summary table highlighting the average monthly earnings of all 11.058 million employees (in a country of 51.2 million people). The median salary is R2 800 a month, which means more than 5 million employees, at least half the work force, earn under R2 800. In fact, with 75% earning under R6 500 a month, it should be clear that SMS as a channel is simply not cost-effective where the transactions will mostly be small.
Case in point: my domestic worker has to catch 3 [minibus taxis]( to get to us in the morning and get back in the afternoon. She pays R5, R8, and R5 for each leg, and pays the same amount again in the afternoon. We pay her in cash, so it costs her nothing to pay the driver in cash. Now imagine her paying for those using an SMS-based payment service. For little measurable convenience to her, she has to pay an additional R6 a day to send 6 payments, which is about R130 a month (ie. 4% of her entire salary) just for the ability to pay for a single necessary service. Would you give up 4% of your monthly salary to pay for work transport where the way you're doing it already is fine and free?

Utter nonsense - I can think of more than one situation where everyone would switch and miners would be loath to. Since this seems a stretch for you, I will detail one such example.
Imagine a fatal flaw was found in SHA256. For the sake of not losing money to this flaw, the PoW was changed and everyone switched to SHA3 or something else. No merchant, web wallet, SPV wallet, or end user would knowingly use the flawed version. But every SHA256 ASIC would become worthless overnight. Logic dictates that CPU and GPU miners would rapidly fill the gap vacated by the ASIC miners, and no doubt ASIC manufacturers would rush to push new hardware out the door. But the existing group of miners would find themselves with large quantities of worthless hardware, and no amount of proverbial weight-throwing on their part would convince anyone using the network to regress to broken cryptography and risk losing their funds.
Miners like to imagine the network needs them, but you forget that they are dispensable and easily replaced.

Ok so here's a zinger for them. I ran the software development division of a multi-national, listed company (in South Africa) for a number of years. I was head-hunted for that role after successfully selling a previous company I started. I reported only to CEO, the COO, the CTO, and the board. My paycheck was...large.
Of course, the job was ridiculously stressful - up at 5:30am dealing with Australia and Hong Kong, deal with local issues during the day, back home at 7pm-10pm after dealing with the US. My family life suffered, and I could see that my wife was unhappy.
Towards the end of 2012 I quit to start an import/export business, which blossomed into a group of companies, several of which are involved in providing products and services that hinge on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As of October, 2013, I have stepped back from any operational involvement in all of the non-Bitcoin related companies in the group, and am fully focused on our cryptocurrency related endeavours.
So that makes me wonder how and why they come to that conclusion? I mean, I can send him my paystub from when I still held my last full-time role to prove them wrong, but surely that sort of opinion is just provably incorrect and silly to hold? I will honestly never understand many of the modern "journalists", such as they are.

Apple can't possibly be aware of every business relationship, every trademark across the globe, every company paid by another to develop and release an official app. I'm sure they stop the major ones, and upon notification for something like this it gets added to a list of flags, but I can't see a way for them to practically preempt this.

[In the second part to his tweet]( he also says that they are "believers in BTC".
I think this puts to bed the debate - PayPal's policies are clear when it comes to selling virtual currency, and they are also cautious when a seller with little track history suddenly starts receiving thousands of Dollars a day, but they don't appear to be "against" Bitcoin, as some have made them out to be.

I'm sorry, but that is utter rubbish. The 33% cut of everything does NOT apply to apps used for external purchases, ONLY to IAP. Apple allow tons of mobile wallets (I found 1066 results when searching for mobile wallet, even though some of them were not direct e-wallets) including PayPal and Google Wallet. This has NOTHING to do with competition, and everything to do with the murky regulatory environment.
It's EXACTLY the same reason that they banned GrooveShark; even though GrooveShark wasn't outrightly illegal, the mounting court cases made it abundantly clear that it was a gray area, and Apple removed the app accordingly. Nobody at the time, or since then, has said "omg Apple removed GrooveShark because it was a competitor to iTunes!" - everyone accepted that it was because of its murky legal status.
Now what Apple *is* doing badly is not recognising the fall-out and explaining themselves, but historically that is always the way they have done things. They don't explain themselves publicly, they just do what they want. Eventually Steve Jobs (or now I suppose Tim Cook) will reply to some random user's email clarifying the reason, and that email will be published on tech blogs everywhere. Complain about their poor dissemination of information, but don't for a MINUTE think that they see Bitcoin as a serious competitor - they likely view Google Wallet as a far more direct threat.

I don't get how you can think that. We can integrate with I2P *right now* via SAM, but adding the Java router as a dependency is beyond dangerous when dealing with someone else's money. We refuse to add Java as an unmanaged attack surface to our user's desktops because we care way too much about risking the safety and security of our user's funds.
The route we have chosen is truly revolutionary, as it will be the first time I2P routing has been integrated into a project without reliance on the aforementioned Java router. Whether it takes 2 months or 6 months or 10 months doesn't matter, we're not doing it haphazardly to win a pissing contest, we're doing it the best possible way in order to achieve the most secure and sound result that presents the lowest risk to our users.

The hardware and storage space is already quite accessible for the "average" consumer, but let's say we go to 500mb blocks (eventually), that means hosting a service that needs a 33.35mbps connection. This is a little out of reach for most, but when you look at the ongoing deployment of things like Google Fiber it suddenly doesn't seem that infeasible, especially if it is only required 3 or 4 or 8 years from now.


I don't want to drift too far from my hypothetical volugeddon scenario, but beyond something like Green Address instant transactions (which would adjust to cater to this anyway) it would be irresponsible for any merchant to accept 0-conf transactions for anything they don't want to lose money on. The ability, right now, to invalidate a 0-conf transaction using BitUndo or similar means that 0-conf transactions should be treated accordingly.


Sounds like more of a RealSolid problem than a forking problem. I'm not convinced that additional time will change the outcome of a hard fork. In fact, if the fork was 3 years away people would talk about it very little and complacency would settle in. In the last few months there would be this frenzy to get everyone to update, which is much the same as just having the frenzy from the get-go;) I'm not advocating for a last-minute fork, at all, I'm just saying that a long build-up won't produce vastly different results from an emergency hard fork.

I would say that a brain wallet with a sufficiently large and unique pass phrase would work, with the key being held by the 2 or 3 people at the top. Those people at the top should be sufficiently liable (legally), should own a sufficiently large portion of the company, and should earn a sufficiently high salary so as to make theft undesirable.
The same could be done with 2-of-3 transactions (I think) such that the coins are unspendable without private keys held by two individuals. The problem is that the risk of those two dying is too great, and I would think the risk outweighs the risk of a single large shareholder trying to steal a large sum and live on the run for the rest of his life.

Errrrr...[as you can see]( I said "Please explain how getblocktemplate will prevent 51% attacks."
I didn't downvote you, and I didn't call you a troll in that thread - at all.
Interestingly - GBT does not prevent 51% attacks in and of itself for several reasons:
1. You can't force pools to use GBT - maybe in 20 years GW will be so deprecated that nobody will use it, but for the foreseeable future pools can use GW and nobody can make them change.
2. GBT only prevents 51% attacks *on the pool level* if it is implemented. The attack is still possible either by agreement (ie. miner collusion) or by a single entity controlling 51% of the hashing power.
Thus, GBT is a superior protocol for many reasons, but it is not the answer to preventing 51% attacks. Proof of Stake is closer to the answer to that.

It would still fail the Starbucks test - nobody is going to wait in a queue for 10 minutes for 1 confirmation on a transaction (or 10 confirmations in the case of an altcoin with a 60s block time for the same level of security). So the fact that it *can* be used for small transactions doesn't mean it can do so in any practical capacity. is right; micro-transactions are better handled off-chain.

Nonsense - if it's profitable (and it will be more profitable due to the difficulty drop) then you can BET that every single altcoin miner will start mining it. There are literally hundreds of thousands of GPUs that currently mine whichever-altcoin-is-profitable, and a lot of those miners can fire up tens of thousands of EC2 instances in a few minutes. The network would most assuredly not be compromised or be unable to process transactions. Don't overstate the importance of miners in a scenario like this, anyone can be a miner, and the only thing preventing it right now is the high difficulty that makes ASICs the only profitable method.

lolwut. You have a strange handle on reality.
In this thread I have defended Greg Maxwell and trashed nothing but Gavin's blog post. I'm known for telling people *not* to buy Monero, and even in my talk on Monero (that I'm giving at Bitcoinference in Amsterdam on Saturday) I call Bitcoin out as being the only really secure cryptocurrency by virtue of maturity and, more importantly, mining network size. I repeatedly point to Monero as being experimental and (at this stage) trivially attacked by a motivated and determined attacker with enough cash to spare. I'm literally the last person "pumping" anything, and am quite happy for people to use whichever cryptographically sound system they choose (including Bitcoin).


At what point did you ask me what my thoughts are? You have no basis for your statement, especially since I'm completely *for* raising the 1mb limit. What I'm against is hard-raising it to 20mb (and, by extension, I'm against a single maintainer throwing his opinion around in the strangest of forums without taking into account the fact that the other 4 maintainers are opposed to the idea).
In fact, in this very thread I've posited [what I believe is a better approach]( to the scaling problem:










You're desperately clutching at straws (strawmen, really) to try and deflect from the fact that you either don't understand my criticism of the blog post or you conflate my criticism of an *individual* with criticism of a *mechanism*.
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:58:53
I'll answer you twice, because there are two salient points:


No, it requires scaling the *system*. Scaling one thing can (and in this instance does) create bottlenecks and issues in other parts of the system. Perhaps the best comparison I can think of is with the scaling of databases. Maybe initially you can just put in faster disks, increase the RAM, and hope that a beefier server will cope. But that is a sucker's bet, as you don't know how much time you're buying yourself (if any). So often the approach to scaling databases isn't to just ramp up to the beefiest server you can get, but rather to stick to somewhat more accessible hardware, and shard the database. Ramping up the blocksize *does not scale the system*, given that there are potentially negative consequences to doing so.


Nobody is denying that the block size needs to increase. The issue is *when* and *by how much* (or perhaps tangentially: by what sort of dynamic scheme). Shouting "increase it to 20mb!" over and over like some sort of stuck cuckoo clock doesn't provide any room for further manoeuvre. In fact, it could end up being so messy with so many dead clients that increasing it again in future is met with even stronger pushback. I would possibly be less opposed to a dynamically scaling system, or heck - even one that followed a dynamic increase based on block height.
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:30:20
Your optional steps are the trick that will make it work - I've suggested the exact thing. If the exchange is forced by law enforcement to provide details of trades etc. they can provide the withdrawal address, but that is useless as *it's not visible on the blockchain*. Once the Monero leaves the exchange it's invisible. When you re-deposit it as the mule / secondary account there is literally no way to link the two (unless you do something retarded like access the exchange without using Tor and your IP address links the two accounts).
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:55:40
The bug they tried to exploit occurred when there were more than 512 transactions in a block (see [the MRL-0002 breakdown]( for more info), but that block was only 71 964 bytes, so a hard cap wouldn't have made a difference;)
I think Bitcoin could use a Monero-like auto-adjusting block size cap, and it would create an environment where older devices on slow Internet connections would gradually fall off the network.
But, as you correctly surmised, there's an edge case where the block size can artificially be increased to force more and more nodes off the network. That said, I wonder how long that could be sustained for, even with incredibly low fees? An attacker would need to have a massive stream of transactions on a permanent basis, and that is costly to maintain. Whether the balance of incentives is enough is something that remains to be seen.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:00:48
To scaling Bitcoin? If I had to posit anything it would be the following:
1. A 6-month hard fork window that adds a VERY slow dynamic increase to the block size. e.g. with Monero we have a look back over a period of blocks, we then get a block size median for that, and miners are allowed to create blocks that are slightly bigger than the median (thus the median increases or decreases over time). This should allow for mainchain to stay decentralised as consumer Internet connections and hardware should increase accordingly (as long as the increase is relatively conserve enough).
2. Encourage and drive centralised off-chain (eg. ChangeTip), decentralised off-chain (eg. Lightning Network), and other systems (eg. sidechains) that take the weight off the main chain. Aim to allow for an environment where the paranoid are able to run a node on consumer-grade hardware / Internet and have access to "raw" Bitcoin, whilst the general populace can use much faster off-chain / cross-chain services to buy their morning coffee.
That's off the top of my head, though, and needs some refinement.
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:15:45
On the flip side, running a Bitcoin related business is becoming really tough - customers have zero tolerance for mistakes and zero patience. Everything is a "scam" no matter how hard you try and no matter how professional you are. Nobody reads, and the first opportunity they have to vent on Reddit or Bitcointalk they launch into a massive diatribe full of vitriol. Rarely are those reports updated with positive news when the company attempts to rectify their mistake, and where the company didn't make a mistake there is never acknowledgement in those threads where a customer says "you're right, I didn't realise that's what the website said" and everyone moves on with their lives.

Many times - ThomasV has been working on multisig in Electrum recently, so we've been doing lots of playing around with raw P2SH transactions.
The reason that UX is important to me is that I started the Electrum-Doge project (and the Electrum-Vert project more recently). Many Dogecoin users are not technically inclined, and the current SPV-style Dogecoin wallets are not great. Electrum-Doge works, but the interface is going to be a sticking point to adoption. We've been fiddling around with a refreshed UI that we'll push upstream, but dang it's a lot of work.
And it doesn't solve the core UX problems - for instance: 8 decimal places are hard to comprehend and work with, transaction fees are not contextual and are difficult to understand for people who have never been able to set their own fees, and cryptocurrency addresses are horribly long.
I fully agree with you. Someone will solve it - likely not me - but until that time the average non-technical person who is over 25 will find Bitcoin challenging to use.

That's fair enough, I guess I'm being a little prickly because the mailing list is the main platform everyone uses for discussion, but then Gavin (and even Mike, to a lesser degree) eschews the mailing list in favour of writing blog posts. His argument goes that he "doesn't have time" to read every mailing list email or something, which is fair enough, but I still think having a debate via passive-aggressive blog posts (with nary a comments section) is not really *debating*, but just *stating*.

I want to cover your later point first -


Bitcoin is experimental, incomplete software. It's technical and complicated to use. To use it in even a mostly-untrusted manner (an SPV wallet) requires a computer or smartphone. Smaller merchants that have accepted Bitcoin with open arms are abandoning it once they realise they haven't had a Bitcoin purchase in many months. Thus, by definition, Bitcoin already excludes the vast majority of the population. That's the nature of something new and (for want of a better term) disruptive. Early adopters are always a terribly small subset of the global population.
It's going to take quite a bit of time before Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, and it's going to take a lot more tooling and ease-of-access work. It's also going to require 2^nd tier networks to enable instant payments and so on.


It's not that it'll be easier to hardfork, it's that once we have more information and data we'll be able to make a better informed decision. It, for instance, something like Lightning is completed and we have this global hub-and-spoke payment system that settles back to the mainchain, then suddenly there's no longer a pressure-cooker on the block size limit, and it can be raised slowly without compromising node decentralisation.

It doesn't matter. The participants who have chosen not to enter the market because of this, even if only 1 person, has "priced it in". The participants in the market who have chosen to ignore it, even if only 1 person, have also "priced it in". Thus we can say that the market has priced it in, especially because market participants rarely act in complete isolation.
Consider, too, that the number of people who will be "surprised" by Satoshi suddenly moving his stash is inconsequential, as they (relatively) hold peanuts between them. Anyone with serious skin in the game is aware of the distribution, which means that the actual amount at risk of being dumped if surprised will tend towards "inconsequential".

You're right, and I've highlighted the key word there.

But there's a fundamental dichotomy there, if you're just talking about a single "blockchain" based system. A settlement network makes larger transactions cheap (ie. anyone can run a node because the requirements aren't burdensome), a pay-for-coffee network has much larger requirements (eg. PayPal has huge installations at data centres around the world).
The reason there's a dichotomy is that in order to "be both" you're effectively saying that nodes have to be huge installations at data centers. This is expensive to operate, which means that there will only be a handful of nodes around the world, owned and operated by large Bitcoin companies, or by conglomerates of smaller companies that can't afford a node of their own. Even miners / mining pools won't be able to afford the hardware requirements of running a node, and they'll pull block templates from those nodes. How long will these run before they get together and say "we're implementing a very affordable 2% per-tx fee, over and above the per-kb miner fee, that goes to a payee address for the node that you relayed through. Transactions that don't include this will be rejected"?

Those two things are not mutually exclusive. Monero has a dynamic block size, capped just above a median, and I have suggested the same for Bitcoin well over a year ago.
You would know this had you asked my opinion on the matter.


I agree, I think SegWit is a misstep. It forces virtually every piece of software even vaguely related to Bitcoin to be modified, and creates a large group of dumbnodes that are pointlessly validating blocks that they are actually unable to fully verify.
You would know this had you asked my opinion on the matter.


I do not believe in censorship of that nature, and I do not believe the censorship on this subreddit and on bitcoin.org was wise. I think that Hearn's nonsense and screeds of blog posts should have been met with open debate, accurate information, and capacity plans that have fallbacks (eg. "if we cannot find a better solution by this date or by the time the average block size is X, we will revert to a hardfork block size increase").

Again: he hasn't been around for ages, and in his absence there has been much improvement. The statement he made that is being pushed as His-Holy-Vision-Such-As-Has-Not-Been-Visioned-Until-Now-No-Nor-Shall-Be-Visioned-Again could only have been based on the information he had up to that time (which was nothing).
Thus a decision has to be made based on what *we* want Bitcoin to become, regardless of a statement made by Satoshi eons ago.

So then we're precisely talking about fixing that very problem, and optimising things via a number of options so that we don't reach that scenario. Look, mainchain Bitcoin either needs to be a settlement network (anyone can host a node), or it needs to be a pay-for-coffee network (only a handful of nodes). It can't possibly be both.


Again, nobody is saying that this needs to be the baseline...although given how well it runs on a Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi 2 it's not inconceivable that it'll do just fine on &lt;$50 hardware forever. The issue is, and has always been, bandwidth related.
But this is a situation that is constantly improving, and if we design the system appropriately it *will* play nicely into the global increase in consumer bandwidth. I posted elsewhere that if we go to 500mb blocks that will need ~33.35mbps to run, which sounds crazy now, but in a world where Google Fiber is old hat? Things are moving so rapidly, we just need to make sure that Bitcoin doesn't outpace it.

The larger issue is that altcoin developers *aren't pragmatic*. Instead of saying: "look, here's this cool thing we're creating, but please use it carefully right now as there are a number of risks" they instead pump-pump-pumpity-pump, or scam VCs out of funding. None of that is acceptable.

Miners can choose not to include transactions, but fees incentivise miners to include transactions.


It absolutely does. It's the very essence of it. No matter how "centralised" mining becomes, miners will still be unable to change the rules of the system without those 20 000 nodes rejecting their blocks. Mining centralisation is nearly inconsequential by comparison, full node centralisation is a very real critical threat.

Ah yeah, I forgot that nodes are paid for routing.
Ok, so what if the fee was fixed, but split up over the hubs that were involved in routing? That way there's a trade-off between getting 3/5 (9/15) of the fee or 1/3 (5/15) of the fee, but with the former you also have 3x the hosting / bandwidth costs. Then the latter likely becomes a more efficient mechanism.
Alternatively, after routes have been discovered, the "best route" selection could be based on the fastest route, not necessarily on the shortest. If the routes are relatively long-lived then this discovery won't take place often between you and places you visit regularly, even though the initial discover will be a heavier exercise than simply discovering a route. The measurement could be based on challenge-response so that the routing nodes can't lie about it.

However, neither Britain nor the US was willing to apply economic pressure upon their multinational interests in South Africa, such as the mining company Anglo American."

A "Bitcoin Foundation" is in and of itself quite a useless thing. I mean, what is their purpose or role in SA? Their scope ends up being too broad, and seeing that BitX, OpenRigs, PayFast, and maybe ice3x are the few local companies actually turning any profit from Bitcoin operations, they don't have enough companies to approach to seek membership (and thus funding).
Even if they had some funding, what would they do with it? Donating to Bitcoin core development is great but ultimately pointless, and I don't see the local guys actually trying to do anything to address the more unique South African needs that Bitcoin could address.
A "Bitcoin Embassy" in a specific city would be a lot more effective. Have regular meetings and hackathon weekends. Provide unlimited merchant integration assistance to any company willing to pay, say, a R200/year membership fee. Have bi-annual mini-conferences where the sponsorship is easy (a large boardroom and food/drink, there are tons of companies that would sponsor that just because).
I used that model to run 0xC0FFEE Cape Town for ages. We had monthly meetings at Woodstock Lounge where we drank more beer than coffee, and ate a ton of pizza. Eventually what came out of that was a group of people willing to work at making a very successful BSides Cape Town 2012 happen.

The comment I replied to focused solely on price. As I stated, price has nothing to do with how useful (ie. is able to serve a particular set of purposes) or relevant (ie. provides cryptographically sound solutions to the ongoing encroachment of privacy) Monero is.

You'll find that Monero had that long before them, and the CryptoNote reference code a month or so before that.
This is because you're misusing a cryptography term (zero knowledge) without understanding what it means. It is used to describe a special type of cryptographic proof: zero-knowledge proofs. What this means is that, for example, Peggy can (mathematically, cryptographically) prove to Victor that she knows the password to open a secret door without telling Victor the password. The story given in the 1990 paper by Jean-Jacques Quisquater involves "Victor" observing "Peggy" going into a path with the secret door, and then coming out via an exit of his choosing. If Peggy repeatedly appears at the correct exit then it is overwhelmingly probable she knows the secret word to open the interleading door. If she fails to appear correctly even once, then she clearly does not know the secret word.
Thus, zero-knowledge proofs must have the normal properties of interactive proof systems, that is completeness (an honest verifier is completely convinced by an honest prover, if the statement is true) and soundness (within an acceptably small probability, no fake prover can convince an honest verifier that a false statement is true). The downside to these systems is that a fake verifier can learn the statement from an honest prover. The special property of interactive zero-knowledge proof systems is that a fake verifier only learns whether the statement is true or false, not what the statement is.
Thus, even Bitcoin has a form of "zero-knowledge proof", did you know that? When you sign a transaction and broadcast it, nodes are able to verify that your transaction is valid *even though they don't know your private key*. All public/private key cryptography is verifiable via a form of zero-knowledge proofs:)
Specifically in the context of cryptocurrencies, though, the original CryptoNote protocol, as well as Monero's push beyond that, has lead to a blockchain that is fully cryptographically verifiable, but it is impossible to know the value of a transaction or even who the recipient is. This is primarily due to a single special component: key images. Because key images are always unique, they prevent outputs from being double-spent (and thus breaking the cryptographically sound verification). Unsurprisingly, you'll find that ShadowCash reimplemented the key image functionality (which only exists courtesy of CryptoNote and, by extension, Monero), which is why they are able to claim that they have zero-knowledge proofs.
Don't believe me? Here is their function to generate key images: 
I really do recommend you spend some time researching and understanding the cryptography involved before making any further statements on this subject.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:24:15
I'd argue that there is another option. If I may demonstrate: Monero currently implements cryptographically sound transactional unlinkability and untraceability. However, it allows individuals to (completely optionally) give their "view key" to a select few, or to the government, or even publish it somewhere.
A view key can be used to reveal all transactions for an account. This means that companies could still be audited, charities could make their accounts publicly visible, and parents could see what their kids are spending the money on. Additionally, details of a transaction can be revealed via a similar mechanism on a per-transaction basis.
So the option I alluded to earlier is this: there already exists a cryptocurrency that has privacy by default, transparency optional. Governments wouldn't need to outlaw it, as law enforcement could still be given the tools to investigate illicit transactions (although they'd need to ask for the person's viewkey first, but that's no different than asking for someone's password to reveal incriminating evidence on their computer).

You're making financial privacy a privilege, when in fact it should be a right. It should not require "many types of money", it should not require jumping through hoops. It should not be limited to a subset of the population with a certain level of intelligence (you wouldn't willingly punish someone born with diminished mental capacity, would you?) or a certain level of access to technology or a certain rating on localbitcoins.
Individuals should be compelled to disclose financial information only at their whim or when legally obligated to do so. What I mean by this is that a government or whoever can compel you to disclose your passwords, which some people do to their benefit or detriment, but it is ultimately at their will and their doing.
In other words, I believe that cryptocurrency should behave more like cash, and you shouldn't need to worry about a relatively simple blockchain analysis aiding in someone figuring out how much you earn or who you're paying.

I dabble - I buy a little here and sell a little there. I probably have 20 BTC on it at the moment (through CoinBr), so not exactly worth writing home about. At the moment my primary interest is F.MPIF.
Daily volume isn't massive - ~770 BTC or so, so I wouldn't expect most trades to be particularly large.
The key here is that listings (at this stage) are all for Bitcoin businesses (on the securities side). Not merely businesses denominated in Bitcoins, but completely, 100% Bitcoin based. That means that any security listed on MPEX would have to be structured in such a way that it (hopefully, presumably) not only maintains the number of Bitcoins invested in it, but is able to increase a shareholder's Bitcoin investment. This is in direct contrast to Havelock, CryptoStocks, and others, where the vast majority of the securities listed are only fiat-profitable and not BTC profitable (ie. a shareholder would be better off sticking their BTC in a cold wallet and not touching it).
Now, over time, as Bitcoin matures and becomes more widely used, there will be a point where it will remain relatively stable against fiat currencies for a longer stretch. This will enable more traditional businesses (retailers, service providers, manufacturers) to operate a Bitcoin business and be Bitcoin profitable. At that juncture, MPEX will be able to list such businesses - given that they are well-managed by known operators and have a solid business plan - knowing that such a business has a reasonable chance of increasing a shareholder's Bitcoin holdings. Given MPEX's track record up till that time, this will make them the de-facto stock exchange, and I would imagine that anyone investing in it now is doing so because they perceive this reality.
Until then, there exists many other vehicles for investors who want to lose Bitcoin by investing in fiat-profitable-but-Bitcoin-unprofitable companies. I see no real reason for MPEX to cater to them.

Nonsense, "solvency" has a very specific legal meaning. Here in South Africa, for instance, there are two specific types of insolvency: *legal insolvency* (also called *balance sheet insolvency*), which is where the total debts of a business exceed the total assets but the company is still reasonably able to repay those debts (a normal and common circumstance when running a startup), and *commercial insolvency*, which is where the company is both legally insolvent and unable to pay its debts as they fall due.
Mike Hearn is most definitely not qualified - on any level - to audit any entity and determine whether or not they are insolvent. Further, he is most definitely not qualified to determine whether the entity is legally or commercially insolvent.
Determining whether the amount in reserve meets or exceeds customer deposits is, really, quite meaningless. It tells us nothing about the company's debts.

Because that's literally what makes it decentralised. It's not that users *should* run a node at home, it's that they *must be able to*. Bitcoin's security model depends on that. If that is no longer possible then we will end up with a handful of large nodes at data centers for the whole planet, and then we're back to a centralised model where those nodes can collude to change rules, blacklist addresses, etc.


There's no current data to show that this is likely to happen in 2016. In fact, we're seeing the opposite. Even if there were a sudden rise in usage so that there were so many transactions for a significant period of time, then people would simply pay higher fees to get their transaction to confirm. That would serve as an interim solution (and would provide us with invaluable data on how a fee market operates under pressure), whilst a hard fork proposal could be tabled for a lot sooner because of this actually occurring.

I've actually used M-Pesa, which I'm pretty certain is something very few people on this sub-reddit can say. M-Pesa has not been universally successful. It completely tanked in South Africa, after Vodacom and Nedbank poured bucketloads of money into marketing it.
Also, M-Pesa works because it has relatively high fees and requires significant infrastructure to run. Whether you're preloading the menu options on to SIM cards using SAT (SIM Application Toolkit) or you've got a USSD interface, it's something that a mobile operator is well suited for. A WASP (Wireless Application Service Provider) could get part of the way there, but they'd have to be USSD only. Bitcoin is ill-suited to this structure.
More to the point, though: M-Pesa started as a way for microfinance lenders and borrowers to transact. Instead, it took off because migrant workers needed a relatively cheap way to send money back to their families. Those migrant workers were the "early adopters", and their families were the ones that pushed for local merchants to accept M-Pesa cash-outs.
I'm suggesting that Bitcoin take the same approach: find the appropriate niches, let those people become the early adopters, and then let it trickle-down.

Not directly, perhaps, but by obtaining certain pieces of information (you made a couple of purchases for goods delivered to your home here, you were paid in BTC by a guy there) it is possible to trace the flow of Bitcoin through the system and make educated guesses as to what you're earning and what you're spending it on.

This isn't just a wallet, this is full node (like Bitcoin Core). If you read the README you can see he was designing it to run in nodejs.
That having been said, matching Bitcoin's consensus is hard in any language - you have to match its edge cases and its bugs. Conformal's btcd is about the best effort in reimplementing Bitcoin Core (written in Go), and that already caused tons of controversy between the Conformal devs and the Bitcoin Core devs.

To some degree, yes, but this could be circumvented in this manner -
- deposit small, random amounts of BTC on an exchange every 1+N days (where N is chosen randomly)
- immediately trade for Monero, withdraw to a Monero address under your control
- every few (1+M, where M is chosen randomly) days take a randomly selected amount from your Monero balance and exchange for BTC, withdrawing to a fresh BTC address under your control
As long as you're using a reasonably paranoid mixin (number of additional utxo signatures part of the ring signature for each input) when depositing to the exchange there should be no easy correlation between the two events.

While we don't ascribe any use-cases to Monero, I'm not convinced that there are *no* real uses for a perfectly fungible, privacy enhancing cryptocurrency. There are also layer 2 systems focused on decentralised, private, throwaway identity and a related trust system that I can't believe has *no* real uses. These are mentioned on the Research Goals section of our design and development goals: 


I'm absolutely certain there are members of the Monero community that are involved in market manipulation, and there's nothing I can do to prevent that except hope that they're exposed over time. This is no different to Bitcoin and other markets, and everyone who dips their toe into a market should be aware of this.
However, I have been very vocal about discouraging people from buying Monero. It's not an "investment", and considering that it's an inflationary cryptocurrency there is not even massive artificial scarcity to drive the price up. Those that have bought Monero have done so either because they're crazy speculators who won't listen to me, or they're speculators who believe it can be self-fulfilling if they're actively involved in building the ecosystem, or they're users who have an actual use-case for Monero.

I never said that there are altcoins that don't have the *potential* to be useful.

Ok so here's the thing: we didn't launch Monero. I'ma [quote myself all Kanye-like]( -


My fellow core team members, people like tacotime and smooth, are very well known and have been around for years. Additionally, thankful_for_today tried to push for his repo to be used for a couple of months after the takeover, so there is enough evidence that we aren't him or them (or at least most of us aren't).
So then we had this cryptocurrency, not forked from Bitcoin, that we're suddenly responsible for, like ageing godparents who suddenly have to raise bratty godchildren after the neighbours die. We didn't go looking for it, much less actively want to be stewards, we just kinda assumed the role so that nobody utterly idiotic did. We've done things with Monero, like an eternal minimum block reward (for &lt;1% inflation) to preserve mining incentives, that will never be added to Bitcoin even if Monero becomes hugely popular and shows a degree of longevity. There are other aspects, too, like the lack of a hard block size limit (there's a dynamic limit that increases with use), or the dual-key reusable addresses, that either won't be added to Bitcoin for political reasons or would fundamentally break Bitcoin in most environments.
All the core team members get on well with the Bitcoin core developers, and there is no animosity between us. Some of us hang out in -wizards, some of them hang out in  There is mutual respect, and an understanding that we are able to be nimble and implement broad, sweeping changes where they are no longer able to do so. If gmaxwell or jgarzik or petertodd or wumpus asked us tomorrow to help integrate ring signatures in Bitcoin we would be ecstatic, although through our discussions I know that they could do so without our assistance:)
We actively, and sometimes aggressively, discourage people from buying Monero. We divorced ourselves from the market price when we refused to change Monero's emission curve from the one we inherited, and we aren't going to tell people it's an "investment" when it quite clearly is not. I have encouraged those that want to make money to build something useful for the ecosystem rather than buy and "hodl" and hope to get rich.
We have created things to benefit and work with both Monero and Bitcoin, such as the [OpenAlias standard]( available in Electrum, Coin.Space, and the Monero command-line wallet.
Whether Monero succeeds or fails is largely irrelevant, at least from our perspective. We want to make something useful and useable, and we want to do so in a way that demonstrates software engineering excellence and is as safe, secure, and decentralised as possible. If parts of what we create are reused for Bitcoin, or its successor in future, that will be the greatest compliment for us, and it will mean we have accomplished what we set out to do.
Edit: one last thing - even if ring signatures and dual-key reusable addresses *are* added to Bitcoin it will be years before they have a sizeable txoset to mix with. Also, in some ways Monero is a hedge for Curve25519 / Ed25519 / EdDSA, against Bitcoin's secp256k1 / ECDSA. If the one is ever truly broken the other probably won't be. Although the risk is marginal (perhaps negligible) djb and Tanja Lange [seem to think that secp256k1 is a bad choice](
Edit 2: forgot to add - shortly after we took stewardship of the project one of the core team members, NoodleDoodle, discovered purposeful obfuscation in the hashing code to cripple it and make it slower. We could've kept this quiet and mined 12x faster than anyone else, making a ton of money along the way. I'd be lying if I didn't say the thought crossed my mind when we were discussing it. But we instead chose to make the improvements public, for the benefit of all, and merged them into the public repository within 24 hours of fixing and testing the hashing code.

Frankly, I don't think many people in this thread even know how Africa is laid out.
Take South Africa, as an example. Unless he can speak Zulu, Tswana, Tsonga, Sepedi, Sesotho, Venda, Xhosa, Ndebele, Afrikaans, or Swazi, a trip to South Africa would be fruitless. One of our northern neighbours, Botswana? Well mostly Tswana, but Kalanga is big there too. Just next to Bots is Zimbabwe where Shona is the main language, although there's a significant Ndebele population too. Oh, and then there's Mozambique just next to them, where everyone speaks Portuguese.
The level of presumption to say you're "going to Africa" (which is a continent with 1.1 billion people spread over 54 countries speaking a mix of over 2000 languages) is crazy.

I'm the interviewee in this podcast, and I can confirm - this would never work for Bitcoin in the form that works for Monero. The block reward penalty is a huge component in curbing potential abuse, and with Bitcoin once that is (basically) gone this system would collapse.
However, there are aspects of it that can be used in Bitcoin. The penalty system could be scrapped entirely, and you could just have a very conservative buffer limit above the median + a longer look-behind that adjusts the median. The key is that the median has to adjust up and down, so that any spam attack doesn't artificially raise the median forever. I don't know what the specifics of the system would look like or if it would maybe adjust too slowly to satisfy everyone, but there's definitely potential for it.

I think altcoin developers should be honest with themselves, and their community, as to how little peer review their design decisions have received, and how little academic research proves / demonstrates their "unique" changes. And, too, I think they need to be honest with just how flimsy their network security is.

That's certainly a central goal of "make sure it can run on consumer hardware on a home broadband connection". Even if there are only 1000 people doing so worldwide it still gives them sole access to the system with their private keys, without (as you so clearly indicate) needing intermediaries.
In other words, your stated goal of "access with one's own private keys" is the same as my stated goal of "average consumer can run a node at home":)

Really. So if Apple allowed Bitcoin apps on their devices, would they have to register as a money transmitter? Would their users have to register as money transmitters? FinCEN have stated that [users won't be regulated]( but there is not enough clarity on everything else, and that does not *preclude* the users having to be registered money transmitters.
Apple has prevented torrenting apps for the same reason - are torrenting apps inherently illegal? No, but the risk of litigation is too great. Torrenting apps may only be used for legal purposes, but all it takes is one royal idiot to screw the pooch and create a legal mess for Apple. They obviously looked at it from a risk perspective, and decided it wasn't worth their while opening themselves up to the risk.
It is the same for Bitcoin. As and when Bitcoin's regulatory status is completely clear (bearing in mind that FinCEN only passed a ruling clarifying whether miners have to be registered as money transmitters a week ago) this will be a different conversation, but right now Bitcoin's regulatory and legal environment is cloudy.

Just off the top of my head: treat it the same way we treat IP routing. Consider:
- The first time a payment is being made to an address, the hub uses a discovery protocol to query its direct peers and find out if they know how to route to that address
- Those peers cascade the query and respond down the chain with any information they have
- The source hub ends up with a list of possible routes, chooses the shortest one, and stores it in a routing table
- These routes are considered transient, and can be closed either by the destination address or after a period of time
- In the event that a payment attempt is made via a hub that can no longer process payment for an address, it is rejected and the routing process begins again

I went to this last year in Cape Town, and it was just embarrassing - it did a huge disservice to Bitcoin in South Africa. A good Bitcoin / "blockchain" conference has a speaker list with a healthy mix of open-source developers, economists, academics, for-profit company representatives, and others. This provides excellent, balanced information on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies / blockchain-based projects, what their use-cases are, and what their future could be.
Instead, it was basically just a startup conference, with most of the speakers pitching their wares. Vinny Lingham from Gyft, for instance, [gave a talk entitled "Bitcoin: A Silicon Valley Perspective"]( The entire talk was about Gyft and how they've grown and how they want to put gift cards on the blockchain (which will apparently "be the first industrial use-case for Bitcoin"). There was literally not a single iota of information on Silicon Valley, much less what Silicon Valley thinks of Bitcoin.
To be fair, all of this could be written off as mere amateur hour errors (and they need to cover the conference costs, after all, so it stands to reason that both attendees AND speakers must pay, right?). Except that they're now doing it all over again, with nearly the same speakers and a few more of the same. If I wanted to go to a startup conference I have my pick of the litter, but it's supposed to be a Bitcoin / blockchain conference. What a waste.

We've discussed it as a community, and as it stands it's unlikely that we will. We recognise and acknowledge the added security benefits of doing so as a merge-mined sidechain, but having to convince a bunch of Bitcoin pools to stick to our bi-annual hard-fork schedule is...well...you get the idea.
There's also some thinking that Monero would be a fallback, even a temporary one, if something disastrous happened to Bitcoin, as we use vastly different EC cryptography (Curve25519 vs. secp256k1) and signatures.

Interesting ideas - I think that some of this will naturally be tackled by developers building out LN. At the Satoshi Roundtable there were indications from at least three different organisations that indicated they're building LN software (including Blockstream), so there's lots of scope for this stuff to be solved. Unfortunately a lot of these groups are working in isolation and behind closed doors (although I'm sure there will be open-source implementations released by some or all of them), so it's hard to tell what the routing solutions might look like:)
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:11:40
You're conflating two different things by not strictly defining "centralised". Remember that all said is that miners can decide not to put your transactions in a block, and that is entirely correct.
What you're talking about is *reducing* that risk, not removing it. Even if there are 100 000 miners around the world ("hooray! Bitcoin is not centralised!") there is still a risk that I can pay each of them 0.2 BTC a month not to mine your transactions, and there is a greater chance that none of them will mine your transactions than that one of them will.

Not true. thankful_for_today forked the CryptoNote reference code (at the time it was in the form of Bytecoin, but has subsequently become reference code). When thankful_for_today refused to listen to the community, we forked it away from him, and seven of us became the Monero Core Team (through no planning of our own, mind you).
Since then we have made 1854 commits from over 30 volunteer contributors.
We have designed, from scratch, [a new Qt GUI]( that is [steadily being worked on](
We have written [our own forum software]( to take advantage of planned future developments such as MoneroID and MoneroTrust.
We have formed an academic research lab that [actively and transparently conducts research]( into Monero's current and future developments. They have published [several research bulletins](
We have discovered, developed, and subsequently published in a [groundbreaking whitepaper, a new ring signature scheme]( that is based on gmaxwell's Confidential Transactions, and adds transaction amount obfuscation to Monero.
In fact, in the 23 months since forking the project from thankful_for_today on April 30th, 2014, we have taken the 90k lines of code, rewritten 14k of them, and added 71k new lines of code. That's excluding pulling in external libraries and modifying them (which is a little unfair, as Howard Chu, the author of LMDB and OpenLDAP, is a major Monero contributor and has made a ton of changes to the Monero-source version of LMDB).
When we've dumped the 22k LoC that makes up the Epee library (in favour of ZMTP as a wire protocol, and standard libraries for the JSON RPC server etc.) there's going to be less, and less, and less that is from the reference code.

No, I think that Core know that the block size needs to increase, but they perceive the short-term fix as being SegWit + wallet adoption, with a block size increase thereafter. I think that the *other side* feels like SegWit is a more complex change or a change that is better done as a hard fork.
The larger issue is that nobody wants to give, on either side. And because there's been a string of insults and insinuations, people prefer to double-down instead of acknowledging that they can meet in the middle somewhere, even if it means giving up something they truly, firmly believe is "right". Also, to be frank, in the court of public opinion Core are doing pretty horribly, and probably should be front and centre trying to find compromises. But that's just, like, my opinion...

"Bitcoiners" are not the same as "market participants". Those are two different groups of people, even if there is some overlap in part. If someone spots a trend and enriches themselves off the latest scamcoin being pumped-and-dumped does that make them a proponent for that scamcoin? I have not spoken about Bitcoiners, only about market participants.

I can confirm much of what Gavin has said in terms of the discussions at the round table.
The "transaction signalling" thing that we were pushing quite hard was because we were trying to bridge the gap between the two "sides". As the conversation progressed we had hoped that signalling could be a mechanism to indicate end-user / wallet / exchange readiness to Core, which would make them feel comfortable bringing the fork date closer.
I'm not sure I entirely agree with on the amount of time it would take to firm up a spec and get clients to implement it, especially since it is something that could provide long-term benefit as an indicator of readiness for all future protocol changes. That said, it's all largely irrelevant now, as the transaction signalling idea eventually got lost in intense debate over 75% vs. 95% and all sorts of other bits and pieces.

I don't think that's the issue, and its a false representation to present yourself as a martyr throwing yourselves on the mercy of the community, willing to now go down as low as 1.5mb blah blah.
What *is* happening here is that there's a general agreement from both sides that a 2mb hard fork is doable, and that SegWit is necessary to fix malleability (and for the obvious size benefits). What is not in agreement is the date that the fork should happen, and what the activation % should be. The size of the post-hard-fork block limit is largely irrelevant to the discussion.

It doesn't speak about JoinMarket, which is literally the only working and useful CoinJoin implementation right now.
It also mentions using an altcoin as a mixer of sorts, but fails to mention services like ShapeShift and xmr.to that have no KYC requirements at all, instead saying you should go to "multiple exchanges with low KYC requirements".
Oh, and no mention of work on Confidential Transactions? Not even as a "Bitcoin might add this in the future"??
Final note, on opsec: even with a cryptocurrency like Monero where you can't track things on the blockchain, your opsec can be compromised by someone else. With Bitcoin, where you CAN track something on the blockchain, your opsec is ENTIRELY reliant on the other people in that chain. Over and above the compartmentalisation of identities you have to be insanely strict with yourself and with who you deal with if you want to retain any measure of privacy.

I live-Tweeted the conference, dishing out the occasional complement to the one or two good speakers (eg. [Lorien Gamaroff]( I was unashamedly critical of Gareth Grobler when he put up a slide about Bitcoin and the Byzantine Generals problem ([here]( and [here]( and one of the conference organisers (Sonja) came to me in the middle of a talk and started telling me that I mustn't Tweet stuff at Gareth because he's offended. I asked her why she was coming to tell me that, is she his mother? She said that I mustn't shoot the messenger, to which I (in fairness to them, rather rudely) told her to get lost, and that he must come talk to me if he has a problem.
Of course, they didn't come tell me I'm banned, that would be too brave. Instead they banned me by Tweet...which they subsequently deleted after a few higher-profile-than-me people on Twitter called them out on it;)

That's not at all relevant. What if:
1. I don't have a bank account in the USA
2. It's not for a single payment
3. I want to do it as privately as possible without involving financial institutions
4. I don't want my home country to tax me thinking I'm taking money out the country
It doesn't even have to be all four of these for your "just use a bank" suggestion to fail.

It *was* a great idea, definitely, which is why I had such high hopes for it. One of the big issues I had was that it was the first taste of Bitcoin for some South African regulators and some of the banks (Absa seemed to be there in full force). I felt that those attendees, the ones for whom the conference was most critical, left with a poorer understanding of Bitcoin than if they'd read the Wikipedia article.
Also won't be attending this year, for many of the same reasons as you. Also I'm apparently banned from attending:-P

If noses do that I think we're in for a smellier problem than expected;)
Working through the "hubs can lie" problem is a challenge. Most of my initial thoughts end up being naive schemes that are trivially defeated, but I've also only given this thought for like 10 minutes. I have a possible idea below, but either way there are most assuredly some smarter folk that can come up with something feasible.


Using the discovery mechanism I outlined two comments up: 
Bear in mind that if the "fastest route" mechanism is used then hubs are incentivised to find a fast route so that they are included in the route and get their cut of the fee. Perhaps a weighted mechanism that takes the 10% fastest routes, and picks the shortest route of those would work. That rules out the majority of cheating hubs that pretend to be two hubs and lie about the routing between them, as they wouldn't be the shortest route even if they are the fastest.


It's not giving advantage to it per se, it's just not going to through the bandwidth-expensive route discovery each time. BGP does route caching, your local networking stack has an ARP cache, and we cache DNS responses.

Privacy is not the same as confidentiality in this context. You can still remain private even if the transcript is published. The meeting was strictly held under Chatham House Rules along with an implication of general privacy, and repeated this on more than one occasion.
The transcript was primarily produced for reference and for convenience. The option for publishing it is not ours, but Bruce's, and as I understood it the transcript would only be published in a redacted form. This is because there were instances were a speaker would indicate that what they were about to say was not to be made public, and at the very least those wishes MUST be respected.
I'd like to point out that I was the main person asking if we could transcribe it, and my main aim was to provide a reference source for myself and a limited number of attendees that required it. It was not a transcription for public release - I already spent a ton of time and effort keeping the Reddit live thread updated along with and that was explicitly to provide the public with transparency.

We've already begun implementing this on the Monero forum. We currently sync the bitcoin-otc WoT down, but the idea is to replace it with MoneroTrust at some point in the future when that actually exists.
The weighting still needs to be played with, but the basic idea is that a vote from someone in your L1 counts as, say, +/-10, where a vote from someone in your L2 counts as +/-5, and a vote from someone in your L3 counts as +/-1. You also have post decay, where every day a post's score decays by a certain amount (say, 5 points).
The upshot of this is that posts that are highly upvoted by people in your trust groups will remain relevant (with a high weighting score) for a long time, whereas posts that are even from someone in your L1, but don't get any upvotes, will decay pretty quickly.
We have this working right now, although there are a lot of improvements we could make to make it more obvious, but it's already a boon to see it in action:)

Cash is perfectly fungible because that property is *upheld by law*. [An old post on this very subreddit]( elaborated on that. The property of fungibility ignores the fact that notes may have serial numbers, because merchants are not expected to look at serial numbers and reject notes on that basis.
To illustrate it: if I lend you $50 in cash, do I care if you pay me back with a $50 note, or two $20s and a $10? No, because the notes are perfectly fungible.
But if I lend you my car, do I care if you return the same car to me? Would I have an issue if you returned the same model from the same year, but just a different car? Obviously I would, a car is very personal.
So if I lend you 50 BTC, do I care about the origin of the coins you're returning? Right now, probably not, but if you're one of the SheepMarket scammers and you're sending it straight from your stash to my Coinbase account...well now. And we haven't even TOUCHED how KYC/AML affects this - we're purely talking about on-chain analysis.

The cryptography has not been peer reviewed, end of story.
I deeply respect the team that has worked on it, and I firmly believe that there is great potential for it, but right now it ranks no better than post-quantum cryptography papers with security claims that are impossible to verify.

The MPC suggestion has been around since the actual cryptography days (not this implementation, I mean when the actual work was done), but it genuinely could be an unsolvable problem, especially given that state actors have been "tipped off" now (if they weren't already).
Either way, why use some risky, untested, compromisable setup based on cryptography that isn't peer reviewed, when we already have cryptographically sound privacy?

The war on cash is specifically an attack on our access to privacy, so let's not go down that road.
As to your example of the taxi driver - try paying your taxi driver in Bitcoin and see how far you get. Specific examples of situations where a certain individual might choose to act contrary to the law (since they are obligated to accept note, after all) do not change the fact that the note is fungible.
@_date: 2016-06-11 06:26:01
That's completely wrong. Think of it like a Sudoku puzzle: over time more and more pieces get revealed, till an attacker can guess all the missing bits. Because of the permanence of the ledger the attacker is not bound by time. This makes it an EXTREMELY risky proposition from a privacy perspective - even the slightest error in opsec from *other people* can compromise your opsec, no matter how good it has been.
That, really, is the biggest risk: no matter how good your opsec, you are reliant on the opsec of others, and you have no plausible deniability.
The biggest companies in this space (Chainalysis etc) are eventually going to get in bed with law enforcement, and feed them information that they will be able to correlate with their own datasets (eg. information gleaned from subpoenaed exchange records).
The good news is that we are working hard to defeat scum-panies like that. My direct involvement is on Monero, which is a pro-privacy cryptocurrency that is not based on Bitcoin's code, and that provides cryptographically unlinkable and untraceable transactions. It is useful as an intermediary to separate your source of funds from the places you spend them, and privacy-aware (centralised) gateways like xmr.to exist to enable this.
Over and above that, I am a massive supporter of JoinMarket, which is the only viable CoinJoin implementation at the moment. Yes, there are systemic risks with CoinJoin in general, but the work the Chris Belcher and others have done is invaluable in the fight for Bitcoin's fungibility. Additionally, there is work such as Greg Maxwell's Confidential Transactions scheme, which is fantastic, and has allowed the Monero Research Lab to invent a novel signature scheme based on it, which has further enhanced Monero's privacy.
Don't perpetuate the lie that Bitcoin is private enough. It only is until it isn't, and work has to be done NOW to ensure that the worst case scenario is never reached.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:28:15
Let's see.
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:42:02


Actually, transactions are smaller than Bitcoin like-for-like. So a CoinJoin transaction ends up being larger than a Monero transaction with the same amount of obfuscation.
And the blockchain is quite prunable, you can throw away everything except the key image set and the txoset. Since Bitcoin's utxoset is unbounded it means we have an analogous pruning mechanism, although if we had a hypothetical world where both had the exact same number of transactions then a pruned Monero node would require more data than a similarly pruned Bitcoin node. However, that pruned node could create completely obfuscated transactions offline and without any interaction with other participants.

That aside, and once again, the issue here is not whether or not Andreas is worthy of respect. It is whether his opinion on SegWit should be lauded as being of some great import. I would expect to see his comment in an article entitled "How Bitcoin Leaders View SegWit", and I would be completely fine with his inclusion in that, but to single him out as some sort of demigod whose opinion is relevant is just another sick example of what calls a "culture of personality".

You miss my point.
Let's imagine you're travelling to a friend's wedding. Along the way you come across a tree that has fallen and has blocked the road. You can't get around it, and taking an alternate route would mean you arrive 2 hours late for the wedding. Do you:
1. Throw a tantrum and bemoan the tree for falling
2. Phone your friend and tell them there's no way you're going to make it
3. Just drive around and arrive 2 hours late
4. Get out your car, walk around the tree, and call a cab
It's not meant to be a perfect analogy, so let's not get caught up on the specifics, but the point I mean to make is that you can *make a plan* that gets you there. Sulking about it doesn't get you there, and it appears that Circle sulked about it until they eventually exploded.

Monero's traffic requirements *are* much lower, but we're not talking about that anymore, we're talking about the impact that optional QoS will have on Bitcoin, and particularly about your assertion that 80% of the network would put some ridiculously low limit on.
I disagree with that, as those running full nodes can already add QoS outside of Bitcoin Core (and some do). If we were going to see such a big impact from it then we would already see it. Furthermore, QoS can be added without a default limit.
The point of adding QoS to Bitcoin Core is to lower the barrier to entry for running a full node, and that means making it *easy* to reduce the impact on a person's Internet connection without having them resort to fancy tricks.

Tomato, tomato. I regularly hit blocks that take an hour and longer, and if the merchant / exchange requires multiple confirmations it means the payment takes many, many hours. That is not fast, it is not 10 minutes, and it's ridiculous to write that off as a "stretch" but then claim that Monero's claim of privacy is some sort of falsehood.
And that's not the only "falsehood" on bitcoin.org, if we're splitting hairs.
* "[Bitcoin is the simplest way to exchange money at very low cost]( - it's not "simple", at all, by any measure, and its fees are nowhere near as low as exchanging cash. OUTRIGHT FALSEHOOD CONFIRMED!
* "[Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf]( - except that they absolutely can, and regularly do, make a payment on your behalf when you use a brainwallet or lose your Electrum mnemonic or whatever. OUTRIGHT FALSEHOOD CONFIRMED!
* "[Bitcoin payments are irreversible and secure]( - totally not irreversible. It can be "reversed" by a different chain with more work. OUTRIGHT FALSEHOOD CONFIRMED!
* "[Bitcoin creates a unique address for each transaction]( - uh...no it doesn't. That is completely optional and unenforced, and with the amount of address reuse going on it's clear that it's not common practice. OUTRIGHT FALSEHOOD CONFIRMED!
See how ridiculous this becomes?
Monero *is* private within the bounds of what is "cryptographically negligible" risk. That is not a falsehood, it is a *provable* statement of fact (as in cryptographically provable under the random oracle model). It is not an outright falsehood to say that blockchain analysis with Monero is hard-to-the-point-of-improbable, even for state-level actors it is hard to unwind transactions. Maybe instead of continuing to waffle about false equivalency you can take a bit of time and read the technical analysis and mitigation presented in [MRL-0001]( and [MRL-0004]( We take end-user privacy very seriously, and if you're going to make counter-claims to that you'd best back them up by fact.
If your counter claim is "it can be deanonymised by good ol' fashioned police work" that's silly, that's like saying that Bitcoin is unsafe and can be stolen because it is incredibly vulnerable [rubberhose cryptanalysis](


I don't agree with using an example like this because it implies that transactional privacy is only valuable if you are buying something illegal. That borders on the "if you have nothing to hide" argument, which I really hope you realise is fraught with false reasoning.
More realistic situations that Monero seeks to prevent are:
* avoiding targeted advertisements based on your spending habits
* preventing crime being targeted against individuals with large holdings (i.e. those directly observable on the blockchain)
* mitigate the unintended leaking of sordid purchases
* prevent unwitting complicity in criminal acts (e.g. receiving "tainted" funds from a thief)
* stop miner censorship based on recipient (e.g. SatoshiDice censorship)
* avoids the revealing of sensitive business relationships
* helps prevent leaks of salaries, profit margins, and revenues
Now these can all occur through other mechanisms. You can be targeted by criminals because they can indirectly observe your wealth. But that is not up for discussion - we're talking about a "reasonable expectation of privacy".
For example: if I receive investment in my company, and the investor asks me to keep his involvement private, he should have a *reasonable expectation of privacy* in that transaction. I know he's invested, but someone who computes the closure of my addresses just from receiving a payment from me shouldn't be able to figure out that I received a large sum from Donald Trump.


Monero makes no claims about equivalency with ZeroCash, so I'm not sure where you get the idea that it is making claims of "absolute" privacy. However, this is much the same as Bitcoin claiming to prevent Sybil attacks. It's not the *only* possible solution, and it's not a solution in the *absolute* sense. What it is is a set of trade-offs that provide *sufficient* Sybil attack resistance, at a reasonable cost.
The same goes for Monero. It is not the *only* possible solution, and it's not a solution in the *absolute* sense. What it is is a set of trade-offs that provide *sufficient* on-chain privacy without the potentially dangerous / broken new cryptography, incredible bloat, computational requirements, or trusted setup that are all a part of ZeroCash.


That's precisely why it's pitched as being *private* and not *anonymous*. In much the same way that Tor protects you by letting you privately browse the web (but does not claim to magically make you anonymous), so too Monero protects our users by letting them transact privately, but makes no claim as to their anonymity. You'd do well to read the front page of [the Monero website]( to at least see what we claim to do - you'll find there's not a single mention of "anonymity" on that page.


I made no mention of Monero being a lottery ticket. I said that buying and holding was *like* playing the lottery, but if you really felt the need to buy and hold a cryptocurrency Bitcoin is the right choice (for the reasons mentioned). At no point did I say Monero was a lottery ticket. At no point did I say that people should buy Monero because it's like buying a lottery ticket.
I'd appreciate you refrain from twisting my words, as you've done on multiple occasions in this thread alone.

I'm one of the Monero core team members, so don't get me wrong, I certainly don't think that Bitcoin is the only game in town. I just think that the innovation argument is demonstrably wrong, and imagining that not a single person will pay higher fees for higher security is also flawed thinking.
@_date: 2015-08-12 10:52:44


Quite - I try discourage people from buying Monero for that reason. It's not an investment. If you are incredibly risk-averse and extremely speculative you may want to buy some, but *if* Monero doesn't whither away over time (which, let's be realistic and very pragmatic, is the most likely scenario) then I like to think that those building out the ecosystem will profit even more - they are at least trying to create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Buying and "hodling" is no better than playing the lottery, and Bitcoin is a much more secure (due to network hash rate) and stable (due to much larger price support) store of value than Monero is at this point in time.


Ah, that's where the confusion lies. I was talking about the Monero core team, the stewards of the project. That's not the [Monero Research Lab researchers]( That's not the [developers committing to the project]( That's not community members building out libraries and parts of the greater ecosystem.
Whilst individual members of the core team do fall in to those groups (it's not like it's mutually exclusive) our role as stewards has little to do with our "skills" or what we do. It is because we were around at the time that thankful_for_today decided to ignore the community and barrel ahead with his own ideas, we aren't complete morons, and we're willing to take the responsibility of stewardship even if that means dealing with animosity or "interest" in us by state-level actors (an unlikely, but possible, scenario).
You can read more here: 


I think you're arguing semantics here.
First off, in my talk I gave at Bitcoinference ([slides here]( I have an introductory slide leading in to a brief primer on how Monero works, and I mention that Monero's transactions are unlinkable and untraceable, clarifying that statement with this footnote (that I say out loud to the audience) - "*within a certain cryptographically negligible measure of risk. The terms unlinkable and untraceable refer to cryptographic properties and are in no way endorsed by Wikipedia, The Guinness Book of World Records, or Encarta CDROM Encyclopaedia 1995 Special Edition. By using this software you agree to indemnify Alice, Bob, and all their agents, and not rifle through their sock drawer at night.*"
On the Monero website, too, we recognise that people will struggle to comprehend "cryptographic negligibility", and so we instead use the following terminology: "By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero enables untraceable transactions. This means it's ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus **extremely unlikely** that a transaction could be linked to particular user." (changed in [this commit]( after extensive discussion on IRC about how to phrase it correctly)
I mean, if we're going to argue the semantics of a particular turn of phrase we could equally go after bitcoin.org saying on the front page that Bitcoin provides "fast peer-to-peer transactions", which is especially misleading given that most people consider "fast" to be "as fast as my credit card" or "as fast as PayPal".
Sure, the counterpoint to that is "but it's faster than a 3 day SWIFT transfer to a foreign bank", but then that just lets me argue that Monero is perfectly untraceable "relative to PayPal, credit cards, and Bitcoin".
It's extremely, extremely difficult to convey cryptographic and technical concepts to end-users unfamiliar with such, and to do so in a handful of words. We do absolutely welcome any and all criticism of our wording and phrasing, and you are welcome to communicate that directly with me, or open an issue on the Monero website Github, or even make a change and submit a PR.

Think of it like playing sudoku. Initially there are lots of holes, and you only have snippets of information. But over time the sudoku board doesn't change (for past transactions), and new information comes to light all the time.
Maybe someone changes their signature address on Bitcointalk, and computing the closure on that links a bunch of other addresses to them. Maybe court documents reveal addresses that were in use by a person or a website. Maybe a darkmarket user is caught and all of his previous tumbles are revealed. With this extra information you can fill in some blanks, and suddenly it becomes a whole lot easier to make certain assertions and conclusions, which in turn reveal other information.
In other words, with Bitcoin the privacy of your transactions is dependent on the actions of others. If every transaction used some form of mixing with a large anonymityset this wouldn't be a problem - the risk becomes negligible as you'd need to compromise and reveal the transactions for a large percentage of users (think 50%+). Currently the large number of non-private transactions (ie. not CoinJoined) means that the anonymityset is way too small, and the leakage is way too great, to make on-chain privacy feasible. But there is hope for the future:)
If you're interested in some technical info as to how the revealing of some details can have a snowball / chain-reaction effect on privacy then I recommend giving the [Monero Research Lab MRL-0001 paper]( a read, as it quantifies the risk (in the context of Monero), and explains why we are enforcing a minimum mixin for every transaction.

He's a buttcoiner, so I don't think he means anything specific.
Also don't fall prey to comparing CT's ring signatures to Monero's (for example), as they are very different ring signatures that serve very different purposes. One of the key advantages to CT is its ability to be pruned without needing an ever-growing verification dataset on pruned nodes, but it sacrifices all transaction graph privacy (obviously unless forcefully coupled to CoinJoin for every transaction). One of the key advantages to Monero is a near-absolute level of transactional graph privacy, but at the cost of disk space.

What a bizarre, illogical conclusion you've come to. I cannot believe how shallow-minded and paranoid everyone becomes from the Reddit echo-chamber.


**That is the statement I disagreed with**. I like to think that, at the very least, Monero offers significant innovation. But innovation alone is not enough, and that is among the reasons why I can confidently argue that "the innovation argument is demonstrably wrong" (plus those other examples I've given). Bitcoin's network effect is simply *too large*, and it's mining network *too strong*, to imagine that something new and shiny will come along and everyone will flock to it.
The second argument I made is that higher fees won't necessarily equate to a permanent movement of users from Bitcoin to something else (including Monero). A fee hike (in the near future) might make some of them switch, but that will be temporary, as they will quickly discover that the currency they switched to cannot offer the same security that Bitcoin can.
So I've literally explained (TWICE!) why people *won't* be flocking to Monero. I've said nothing about Bitcoin's block size, even though [my view on the matter is in favour of an increase in the block size](
Trying to twist what I say to appear as some "keep Bitcoin small" argument shows just how desperate you've become to find malice in everyone. It is truly, truly sad.

My point is that you don't need to introduce unnecessary trust to a trustless system, there are alternatives (as indicated). Plus you'd be surprised - not only can "the people you trust" have perverse incentives, but you don't know if you're really talking to them short of being in the same room as them. GPG keys can be coerced, encryption can be broken through rubberhose cryptanalysis, so it's generally better to find ways of removing the human element as much as possible.

Yeah you hit the nail on the head. I was a lurker when the whole thing started, because I didn't feel like I knew enough to say anything, but I remember being *really* excited about BIP12. And then when that was withdrawn I felt that BIP17 was the better way to go, especially because breaking changes *could* have been made relatively easily then. But the thing that drove me away from BIP17 was that I struggled to divorce the technical merits from the abrasive personality of its creator, and even though we've made peace and he no longer receives my ire I would still struggle to take anything he proposed without a large dollop of scepticism.

I'm one of the Monero core team members, so I'm an advocate for altcoins, but I'm extremely cognisant of how cheaply EVERY altcoin can be attacked.

There is no other altcoin that comes close to that, regardless of the proof system they use.

Oh I know - I've said multiple times (even in this thread) that we can't expect the behaviour of miners and node operators to be "rational" by our personal rules and beliefs. Miners can be swung by perverse incentives that make sense to them, but that we can't fathom for want of more information.
But that also, then, lends a counterpoint to yours (and I agree with the point you raised, by the way) - what if a cabal of miners proclaim very loudly that they've switched to notXT to muddy the waters, and this appears to be demonstrated by their pools mining a number of blocks as either-XT-or-notXT?

I live in South Africa, and that's an expensive connection ($86/month uncapped). Also that only gives you 1mbps up, and upstream bandwidth is the only thing that matters here (for rebroadcasts).
As pointed out, you can calculate the bandwidth required for 20mb blocks: (20mb * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 37.3mbps upstream. To get that in South Africa, on a residential level, you'll need to bond VDSL lines (3mbps upload, 20mbps download per line). So that's 13 lines, at a cost of $117.78 each, so $1 531 a month.

In Sweden, yes, but that's not even representative of Europe (and, incidentally, Sweden's Internet is absolute rubbish [compared to Romania](
Where [Sweden's average broadband speed]( is 59.3mbps down, 31.2mbps up, a major financial power like [Germany has an average broadband speed]( of 32.7mbps down, 5.5mbps up.
But more importantly than all of that, I really hope the implication is *not* that Bitcoin should be governed by first-world elitists happy to exclude the majority of the population of entire continents from being able to run a node. By means of an example, for me to get 28mbps in South Africa with no data cap I first need to be in an area that supports 20mbps - 40mbps VDSL, and every month I'll pay R166.50 (line rental) + R599 (VDSL line service) + R1397 (shaped, uncapped VDSL), so $170/month.
Without drifting too far into block size debate territory, I do think it's prudent to consider that Bitcoin has the power to free so many groups of people, but most especially those in repressive countries (those that *don't* pride themselves on free speech and democratic media). Locking them out of access to Bitcoin should be unconscionable.

Don't worry, I didn't take it as negative - I was just pointing out that Monero nodes *can* prune, not trying to make a comparison between the two:)


100%, and a physically larger blockchain (even when pruned) is one of the sacrifices Monero makes for the added privacy.
Edit: I also don't think that anyone should take this, or even stern criticism, as negative if it's in the context of technical discussion.

Bytecoin is a *premine* scam, but the crypto behind it is solid (see comments from andytoshi, gmaxwell, or our own [annotations]( [academic review]( and [subsequent research bulletins]( Referencing it is largely irrelevant - it's like complaining that Litecoin is based on a known scam coin (Tenebrix). At some point you've got to let it go.


I know, because we've been working on huge improvements, major overhauls to the codebase, and dumping any obfuscated or poorly written code (whether purposeful or not).
To that end: when we originally forked Monero it consisted of 113 042 lines of code, all part of the CryptoNote reference implementation. Monero currently consists of 418 164 lines of code, and we're responsible for adding or working on 76% of that. That excludes the 55 000+ lines of comments we've added.
In view of the foregoing that argument is nonsensical, but it is most especially nonsensical considering that the people working on Bitcoin "didn't even write it" and "the people who created it left". Pot, kettle, black.


I would love to know where I said that. I am actively involved in Bitcoin (primarily on the research / cryptography side), in Namecoin development, and in Bitcoin-related projects. We most certainly are "qualified", but we are also cognisant that many of the things that make Monero unique and that we work on (infinite tail emission, [Ed25519-based protocol improvements]( [alternative PoW algorithms]( will never be incorporated into Bitcoin, or only in a very weird alternate future where voiding its social contract (emission) and destroying the basis for thousands of businesses (sha256 mining) is a thing that happens.

Because, as Adam Back puts it, privacy is a side-effect of fungibility. Bitcoin's lack of privacy leads to real world consequences (as demonstrated by Elliptic's product above).
The classic example of fungibility is given in the cash vs car example. If you give me $20, and I give you 2x $10 notes back, do you care? No, cash is extremely fungible. But if you lend me your car for a month, and I give you a different car back, do you care? It might be the same make, model, colour, but you'll still be upset because a car is personal, it can't just be swapped.
So if you give me 1 BTC and I give you 2x 0.5 BTC back do you care? Well, yiu might say no, but what if it's sent to your Bitcointalk address, and the funds are directly from the Evolution exit scam? Now suddenly you're connected to Evolution, and the police are gently knocking your door down right ceize your computer. This scenario may not have played out yet (that we know of), but we already see evidence of blockchain analysis from CoinBase and similar, where they block accounts on suspicion of certain things (suspicion derived from observing the account's expenditure). Tools like WalletExplorer, and companies like Elliptic and Chainalysis, are only going to exacerbate the problem.
Therefore, Bitcoin is not fungible, or at best is weakly fungible.
Because of this fact it is intellectually dishonest to call Bitcoin a money, as it fails in the fungibility category of your analysis. Merely writing an article does not make a thing so:)

A successful attack against a PoW coin is very different from a successful attack against a PoS coin. Sustainably attacking a PoW coin takes WAY more than just spending the money once, you have to keep up your 50% as more legitimate mining power comes onboard. You have to pay the electricity costs. You have to do this forever, and all it lets you do is inconvenience and annoy the rest of the network. The minute you change the rules on your 50%+ you get rejected by legitimate nodes and services, so at best you can double spend your own transactions.
With a PoS coin you have 50% and you're golden. You're still somewhat constrained, but you'll keep minting the 50% forever, so your holdings won't decrease.

lol, dude, you're arguing with someone who has been advocating Bitcoin since 2011. I was literally the first online store to accept Bitcoin in Africa, and I've just come back from a speaking tour of Europe where I spoke at Bitcoinference and other events.
You're making yourself look silly by not understanding what I'm saying, and then stating a point that nobody's arguing.


Awwww, it's so cute when pseudo-intellectuals try argue academic concepts.
If I send you 1 BTC from Coinbase, and you send me 2 "subunits" of 0.5 BTC each...but then Coinbase freeze my account because your "subunits" come from the Bitstamp theft...how is that fungible? Coinbase had no problem with *MY* subunits, they have an issue with yours.
Traceability destroys fungibility, Coinbase *shouldn't be able to tell* where the funds are from.
But hey - you're not just arguing a point I'm making, you're also rejecting the same point that Adam Back is making. You know, Doctor Adam Back, the guy that invented HashCash. Oh, and it's the same point made by Greg Maxwell in his [Elements sidechain slides]( (the bit on CT).


No, it's being used as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Just like someone can say "you can pay for this with a 1oz bar of gold", someone can also say "you can pay for this with 1.384727 BTC". Neither of those are a money, but they are both mediums of exchange and stores of value.
Merely because Bitcoin isn't a money doesn't mean it isn't incredibly useful, it is absolutely game changing. It is also innovative and unique, and quite probably the basis for all our financial transactions in the near future.
It is truly sad that individuals like you continue to do such a great disservice to the Bitcoin community by continuing to lie to yourself and to those around you. Shame on you.

That's not true. Innovation is largely irrelevant given the network effect Bitcoin has. If innovation mattered then we'd have used Betamax instead of VHS.


*If* that had to happen it would be people paying $10 for transactional security. Bitcoin is the only truly safe cryptocurrency not because of some technical magic, but because the mining network is so large that an attack is financially prohibitive. No other cryptocurrency has a mining network (at this stage) large enough to compete.
Thus is is true that people might naïvely switch to using WaffleCoin (not a real thing) with its ultra-cheap transactions, but when WaffleCoin starts getting attacked, double-spent, forked, and subsequently delisted from exchanges...well that's the end of that, and they come flocking back to Bitcoin and paying the $10 transaction fee.

You're right, although you've swapped them around - Eligius supported BIP17, and eventually relented and switched to BIP16. That said, it's important to remember that BIP16/17 was at a VERY different time, with a much smaller community + an almost non-existent non-technical community, and a much smaller economy.
I'd also hazard, without offending luke-jr, that a lot of the contention was personal and his reaction at BIP17 not being more prominently supported. And, of course, Tycho / DeepBit didn't help things, and for quite a while he had enough hashing power to prevent either proposal from kicking in.
Oh, and one other major difference is that a lot of the contention happened "behind closed doors"...not literally hidden, but public on the very technical forums (mailing list, github etc.) that the small non-technical community never paid attention to. This is on a completely, completely different scale, and it is so public and politically charged that even the -dev mailing list is becoming unreadable.

The traffic in Bitcoin is largely irrelevant to the point, especially since rapid block propagation between pools is almost entirely reliant on Matt Corralo's Relay Network.
We're talking about "last mile", non-mining full nodes that don't care about rapid propagation, as long as they don't fall behind, and for that QoS is a major boon, if not a necessity.

Ok I'm trying not to be rude here, so bear with me, but let's analyse the sentence "*If innovation mattered then we'd have used Betamax instead of VHS.*"


We're evaluating whether something is true or not.


Ah, this is what we're analysing. If true, then innovation is truly the defining factor for success.


The result of our phrase evaluating as true. We're looking for things like "only the first-to-market wins, and simultaneous or successive discovery is largely irrelevant."


Contraction of "we would", in other words "this is the action that would result, if the previous condition were true".


"Have" is a verb, as in "I have the cheeseburgers". "Used" is also a verb, but it is the past tense of "use", and therein lies the rub. In context the group of people (we) are indicating that, in the event of the aforementioned condition being true at some hypothetical point in the past, our resultant action *would have been* for us to *use* something, at that particular point.


Ah so there's the completion of the sentence. So now, in view of the foregoing, we can understand that the sentence means that *if* innovation was important, then a group of people (the royal "we") at some point in the past would have chosen Betamax over VHS.
It does not mention what this group of people would have done in future. It does not mention subsequent standards. It mentions only the choice they *would have made* at that mythical point in the past, if innovation was somehow a defining element, the swing variable, so to speak.
In fact, if innovation were terribly important, we'd all have used Windows Phone instead of iOS, MySpace instead of Facebook, and so on. Innovation is *a factor* in success, but it is not *the sole factor* in success.

That doesn't match with your argument. You said: "In reality you're relying on trust even when you download the full blockchain", which assumes you're running valid software. If an attacker has duped you into downloading bad software then everything else is irrelevant, as he's able to use that to backdoor your machine permanently. We're not talking about that, especially because the check of "am I running a valid copy of Gitian-signed Bitcoin" is an easy visual one (matching a SHA sum, which can be done using multiple untainted mechanisms including Tor).


No, the software can determine the honest peer out of 30 dishonest ones *without any intervention*. You're confusing the cryptographic concepts of honesty / dishonesty (as respects proofs and verifiers, but used here as respects nodes in the consensus network) and "trust". Bitcoin doesn't require *trust* to sync up, but it does require that it is connected to *at least one honest peer*.
In other words: in cryptography when there is reference to trust it is in the context of *believing* that the person you're talking to has not been compromised (eg. setting trust on their GPG key). With Bitcoin it doesn't matter if the node you're talking to has been compromised, as long as you eventually talk to one that hasn't. You don't need to trust any particular node, you don't even need to know who runs them, thus Bitcoin is a distributed, decentralised, trustless network.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:35:51
The same procedure can run through a decentralised exchange, the ShapeShift / xmr.to example was merely to indicate that it can currently be done in a smooth manner.
Similarly, a merchant can choose to accept Monero directly, which then there's no need for any exchange slippage during the transaction.

1. Miners don't stop mining if they have to censor certain transactions, they continue mining and collecting fees. Miners could be obligated to censor those transactions by their government, but that won't stop them from mining the rest of the transactions. Bitcoin won't die and it won't suffer, JoinMarket transactions will. It's also incredibly naive to imagine that miners don't have perverse incentives, when we've seen evidence thereof already. Additionally, it's easy for a data provider (eg. Chainalysis) to be a JoinMarket provider through a string of sock-puppet participants, and thus know what transactions they're involved in. This may not reveal every JoinMarket transaction, but it can certainly reveal most of them.
2. You explicitly called into question my statement that JoinMarket / CoinJoin doesn't "solve the fungibility problem", but now you're stating that solving the fungibility problem is outside of CoinJoin's scope? Pick a position and stick to it, please.
3. It worries me that you think it will become unworkable, I can't tell if you're being disingenuous or ignorant. A government mandated AML check on deposits is entirely plausible, and companies like the aforementioned Chainalysis are positioning themselves to provide this data. It's not about stopping CoinJoin transactions from occurring, it's about rejecting deposits / payments that contain tainted coins. And the minute a tainted output is used as an input in a transaction, all subsequent outputs are considered tainted, which means any funds introduced into the JoinMarket circle would rapidly become tainted.
It is intellectually dishonest of you to claim that JoinMarket makes Bitcoin fungible. Not only is it incorrect, but if you are not able to understand the limitations of JoinMarket how will you ever be able to try and improve it? Knowing that it cannot do a certain thing is not an admission of failure, it's a level of pragmatism and transparency required when you are dealing with the funds, wellbeing, innocence, and maybe even lives of your users.

It's a temporary solution at best. Helix gets "clean" coins by trading the "dirty" ones for (presumably) untainted ones.
This is fine until exchanges put their foot down and stop accepting tainted coins, and then a mixer is just a closed circle of tainted funds. Even if only major exchanges do this, it till means there's very limited liquidity for "clean" coins.
At the core of this problem is Bitcoin's lack of fungibility, and whilst there are fantastic efforts at solving the *privacy* problem (eg. Confidential Transactions, JoinMarket) none of them can solve the *fungibility* problem. Excellent efforts like JoinMarket will eventually succumb to being a cesspool of tainted coins, and Confidential Transactions will only be confidential within that sidechain (so, notably, pegging in and out of it will still encounter the same issues).
That said, I love Bitcoin, but I think it's important to embrace it for what it is (an incredibly secure, decentralised *public* ledger) and not try force it to be something it isn't. There are other solutions for perfectly fungible cryptocurrencies (I'm, of course, [a little biased](

Because the host operator has complete control over the guest OS, and they can get that node to do whatever they want. Bitcoin only works if the majority of nodes are scattered and controlled by individuals, in various jurisdictions, all over the planet.

They have a vested interest in complying with AML / KYC procedures, and companies like Chainalysis / services like WalletExplorer provide easy integration and querying for them.
Right now the nature of AML / KYC, as respects Bitcoin, is a little...nonspecific. But if a law was passed requiring them to only check that inputs do not come from "known bad" sources, then everyone will just bounce their funds once within their own wallets before sending them. And so maybe the law changes to having to check two "depths" back, and then people self-mix a little further, and so it becomes an ongoing battle.

"The closure of a bitcoin address is defined recursively as follows:
1. An address is contained in its own closure.
2. If address A is in the closure, and there exists a transaction using coins from address A and address B as inputs, then address B is also in the closure.
The motivation is that if two addresses appear together as inputs in some transaction, then the two addresses are very likely to be controlled by the same entity. As a result, all of the addresses in the closure of an address **are very likely owned by the same entity**."

The person you're paying doesn't receive those funds instantly, even if their BitPay settings specify 100% settlement in Bitcoin.

Edit: really? Downvotes? OP is a moron trying to sell transactions entering the mempool as being "instant", and supporting that lie is bad for Bitcoin. At best people will be disenchanted when they realise it's not true, at worst they'll be the victims of a double-spend when receiving Bitcoin.

1. If you have a large mining installation that chews power it is not unthinkable to imagine that the government may know you run a mining installation, and *obligate* you accordingly. Similarly, mining pool operators are known entities, and their pools can be strong-armed. There is a great deal of legislation passed in the USA that has knock-on effects in many others. With respects to Sybil attacks, an attacker doesn't need to discover every transaction, just enough of them to enable educated guesswork on the rest.
2. But again, if JoinMarket truly made Bitcoin fungible then the receipt of tainted coins simply wouldn't be possible. That is not to say that receipt of coins wouldn't be possible, just that taint would be impossible. JoinMarket could only facilitate this if it was enforced for every transaction, which is a non-starter, and thus it stands to reason that JoinMarket is *good for privacy*, but does little to solve Bitcoin's fungibility problem.
3. AML checks are absolutely run in an automated manner against electronic transfers, at least in South Africa. I can't imagine that other countries are so far behind that they lack this capability. AML checks are inherently linked to fungibility, as they're a good test of fungibility. Cash is not affected by AML checks, unless you deposit it with an institution (which is, in effect, exchanging physical cash for digital cash, and thus bereft of the benefits afforded physical cash).
I deeply respect Adam and Greg greatly, but they are not economists, and if they have stated that CoinJoin magically makes Bitcoin fungible then that is grossly incorrect. Fungibility is a special property of cash that Bitcoin lacks, and CoinJoin / JoinMarket alone are not enough to make Bitcoin fungible. We can argue semantics till the cows come home, but it is well known by economists, monetary theorists, and others, that Bitcoin *is not fungible* as a currency. JoinMarket, in its current form, does not change that fact. It does, however, do a very great thing for end-user privacy, and that should be applauded - as I have done so loudly and publicly. It's better for you to code than waste your time arguing that it does something it very clearly cannot:)

No you're not, not in the sense you're describing. If we ignore the existence of hard-coded checkpoints, the only way to defeat a Bitcoin node is by complete isolation. All it needs is ONE honest peer and it can sync up to the "real" network, rejecting the dishonest peers in the process.
Because of the nature of the network, and the way nodes hunt, it is quite likely that even complete isolation is only sustainable for a short period of time before a random connection to an honest peer allows the node to defeat the isolation. This is in deference to your example, where you need to have a supermajority of honest friends. A Bitcoin node needs only one, and if the 30 different people each told it a different story it would be able to determine the real one. This is about as close to trustless as you can get.

The password analogy is actually a really good one. Many moons ago we thought that storing an MD5 of a password was just fine. Then lookup tables (and eventually rainbow tables) came along, and we realised that cracking it was trivial, so we added a salt to the MD5 to defeat that. Then brute-force and dictionary attacks against MD5 and SHA1 became so powerful that we switched to SHA512 / RipeMD / SHA3 etc. Still this is not really enough, and so we enhance it with key stretching algorithms like PBKDF2 / bcrypt / scrypt.
The key here is that the strength of individual passwords is largely irrelevant (all it does is make it slightly harder for an attacker, but processing power and access to it continues to increase), and once a password hash is leaked it's too late to do anything about it. All you can do is hope that the attacker doesn't manage to crack your particular password, bearing in mind that they have a virtually infinite amount of time to do so.
Now consider that the Bitcoin ledger is a dataset of N records. Because of address reuse, this dataset doesn't grow quite as rapidly as we'd like. Thus, again, analysts / attackers have virtually unlimited time to try and "crack" that dataset.
Now here's the thing: the metadata that an attacker has that they use to reveal information about Bitcoin transactions is also ever-growing. Sometimes it's by scraping posts on forums / Reddit / Twitter where people mention their address or a transaction ID of theirs, sometimes it's by grabbing data from hacks, sometimes it's by labels being added to blockchain.info and similar, sometimes it's by law enforcement exposing information (legally obtained or not). The more metadata they have, the more they can infer from Bitcoin's ledger.
Thus the privacy of your transactions is rarely dependent on your personal opsec, as it can be compromised and revealed (over time) by an attacker's ever-growing metadata. And unlike passwords, which are somewhat transient and irrelevant, an attacker eventually figuring out that you are responsible for a particular transaction (even many, many years later) could endanger your life, reveal your religious affiliations, leak your sordid purchases, provide information to advertisers they previously wouldn't have been able to get, put you in prison, highlight confidential supplier relationships, or make you the focus of targeted crime.

I would imagine that the number of commits, and the growing list of contributors, is evidence of the platform being self-sustaining.
As to the anti-fragility of the consensus system as a whole, there is no cryptocurrency that has as large a mining network as Bitcoin by any measure. However, that is not to say that Monero's mining network is trivially attacked, and that too is growing quickly.
There is also evidence of robustness and anti-fragility in Monero having existed for over a year, and more importantly in having survived a sophisticated attack meant to permanently and devastatingly fork the network.

Ok so I did a quick check - if you're doing small amounts (1 BTC or less) then ShapeShift -&gt; XMR.to is good. At the current rate 1 BTC on ShapeShift will get you 474.6429 XMR, which XMR.to will pay out as 0.9602025867 BTC. So costs on small amounts are ~4%, and you're paying for the convenience + not needing to have a Monero wallet.
For larger amounts you'd want to do it via an exchange (as in BTC -&gt; XMR, withdraw to your wallet, deposit to a separate and unrelated account on the exchange, XMR -&gt; BTC, withdraw to an untainted BTC wallet). Liquidity is reasonable, especially given that you'll almost be trading against yourself, so you could probably do north of 250 BTC a day without much slippage.

"enough to make every coin the same as any other" within a very small closed circle, yes. Consider the following:
1. It is trivial to know which transactions are JoinMarket transactions even if you don't report them being filled, as changes in the orderbook can be observed and correlated with actual transactions (plus the multiple matching outputs is a dead giveaway). Thus, regardless of how you try and hide the CoinJoin, miners can choose to censor just those transactions, which means they are not fungible.
2. JoinMarket helps protect when you are paying someone else, but it does nothing to protect you from receiving funds that are tainted. Thus, it cannot solve the fungibility problem without a hard fork making it a mandatory part of the protocol for every transaction (and the blockchain bloat impact of such a thing would be monumental).
3. If a sufficient number of illicit funds are washed through JoinMarket then those providing liquidity will end up with a wallet full of tainted funds. This is the closed circle thing, and if exchanges/merchants move to block all tainted coins (in order to comply with hypothetical future AML/KYC legislation) then it will be exceedingly difficult to get untainted coins out of JoinMarket. In other words, the coins are not fungible.
As I've mentioned before, JoinMarket is an excellent positive step in enhancing Bitcoin's privacy. But it does not magically make Bitcoin fungible.

You're either doing one of two things: producing a chain of 1:1 inputs -&gt; outputs (ignoring fees) which doesn't break anything as it's still the very same coins used in our hypothetical double spend, or you're producing an ever-branching **chain of transactions** that comes together in the end (thus revealing you to be the owner of all the branches). Tracing the first example is trivial and needs nothing fancy, tracing the second is easy using a tool that computes closures.
Why is the minutiae so important? Pedantry isn't necessary for this conversation, and the only thing I'm trying to convince you of (that you seem to be ignoring) is that payment processors and exchanges *are* going to implement these sorts of systems, either by being mandated to do so or because they're overzealous in their risk controls.

It denigrates and massively disparages the work of unpaid, volunteer open-source software engineers. The "team" that got Bitcoin to where it is today certainly wasn't some "dream team" backed by slick VC funding and overly generous PR.
There's certainly cause to celebrate ZeroCash's brand new cryptography, and it should be treated as one would treat any new whizz-bang cryptography that lacks peer-review and maturity. And there is certainly a case to be made for the cryptography being fundamental to the cryptocurrency we'll be using in 10-20 years time.


I can't find where any of them mentioned it being a "dream team"? Nobody is disputing the collection of talent that VC funding can buy, and I'm certain it maybe possibly won't go the way of Mojo Nation.

They agree to replace / change the original *rules*, but the original chain still exists, and still has to be able to be validated by the code. Thus the original rules still exist in the software.

The anonymtityset is based on the global txoset. If you happen to have utxos that have a small set to mix with (eg. particularly large denominations, like 10k XMR, only have a few hundred candidates on the blockchain) you can increase the anonymtityset for by cycling your own utxos back to yourself, and thus increasing the anonymtityset for that denomination.


How do you define viability? In the past year we've had well over 1000 commits to the project from over 30 contributors ([including a small one from Bitcoin's lead developer]( and we're not standing still. Using ShapeShift and xmr.to all Monero users can already pay any Bitcoin-accepting merchant, so there's no need to try and drive merchant adoption. By most definitions it is already quite viable, so I'm intrigued as to how you define "viability" in this context.

You can turn off automatic updates, but in this instance the FBI have the phone physically in their possession (and can thus upgrade it in DFU mode).
However, what you're suggesting ("provides access to all of the phone's data") is not possible. A good starting point is to read [this article by Trail of Bits]( The key here is that the iPhone in question doesn't have Secure Enclave, which is a physical chip / computer in the iPhone 5S and newer that brokers access to encryption keys, and IT will lock you out far more aggressively than the older software solution will. You cannot bypass this. Apple cannot bypass this. Secure Enclave is an exceptionally well-designed piece of hardware that is designed to protect users.
That said, even on the iPhone 5C in question (that doesn't have Secure Enclave), and on newer iPhones, there is an underlying chip that takes 80ms to actually compute and verify passcode attempts. This is a physical, hardware-based limitation that - again - neither you nor Apple can override. This means that it's trivial to crack a 4-digit PIN code on this 3.5 year old device, but if it has anything slightly more robust (say, a 5 digit alphanumeric passcode) that would take them 2.32 years to crack. An extra digit in the passcode bumps that up to 144 years.
Apple has done a fairly good job of making sure that the data is out of reach (significantly better than most Android manufacturers), and I think that any commentary has to be balanced with acknowledging this.

I also think that by the time they get there the entire C-Suite will have relocated to a country willing to take the USG on. After all, if "11 carrier battle groups" were that powerful Edward Snowden would be on US soil.
I'm not saying that Apple won't fail in strong-arming this, but if they DO fail it will be very messy, very public, and thus could potentially change the course of world history.
You forget that we live in a world where the dissemination of information is so real-time and so broad that even the US Government cannot stop it.

There's literally no way to combat this. If there are 100 real people using it over the course of an hour, the NSA will simply run 1000 fake "people" trying to use the service. They will all enter the queue at random points around the real people, so there's no need for them to slot in anywhere. The real thing that Wasabi does to combat this is by making it costly to participate, but as already indicated a resourceful attacker will have no problem paying for this.
Incidentally, this is not a unique problem - even Monero can be Sybil attacked, it's just that you'd have to own 80%+ of the outputs on the blockchain in order to do so, which is impossible because of the chain's history. [MRL0001, the first research paper the Monero Research Lab ever put out]( detailed this attack.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:00:31


Let's assume that this is even a possibility (doubtful, given the current regulatory environment and involvement from actors like Chainalysis et. al.), that assumes Monero is (you'll excuse the phrasing) a one-trick-pony.
But Monero offers so much more than just transactional privacy. Here are some things that Bitcoin can't do, or won't likely do:
- Monero is slightly inflationary (technically it's slightly disinflationary, as inflation is provided by a fixed minimum block reward and thus the inflation percent slowly drops from ~0.8% in 2020 downwards). Bitcoin couldn't do this without breaking its social contract.
- Dynamically limited block size, based on median block size. Bitcoin may make a move in this direction, but given the current debate it's unlikely.
- Different cryptographic curve (Curve25519 vs. secp256k1). If secp256k1 is found to have a critical failure (as Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange suspect, per [SafeCurves]( then Bitcoin will find a hard time moving to a different curve, especially given the massive number of implementations/libraries in all sorts of languages.
Beyond those few points off the top of my head, remember that any move towards transactional privacy in Bitcoin's protocol will start from scratch - there will be no usable and large anonymityset, and thus it will have to build up over time and at great risk to those requiring that privacy.
Additionally, there's also time that will pass between now and when Bitcoin eventually (if ever) has privacy baked into its core. It is quite possible - maybe even likely - that in that time Monero will carve out a niche for those use-cases that require transactional privacy. Thus it will continue to be a viable store of value, as those pro-privacy users will be the ones that set the market value. This will be a network effect, of sorts, just in a particular niche that Bitcoin is currently unable to play in.

That's even more nonsensical. I suspect you're conflating an exploit with a backdoor.
Your device obviously has unmitigated access to its decrypted data, otherwise you wouldn't be able to use it. There is no remote access to it without authentication.
When Cook says that the software "does not exist today" he does not mean that there is some magical backdoor that Apple holds the key for, but they haven't written software for the FBI to access it. He means that the subsystem in iOS that would require this unmitigated remote access to decrypted data *does not exist today*. It *can* be written, but Apple are *refusing* to do so.
This is not the first time Apple has been clear about their approach to end-user privacy. Most relevant was [his interview with Charlie Rose a few months ago]( where he said:

If you start with the assumption that a little bit of effort is "good enough" then it becomes hard to improve it (see: Bitcoin's complete lack of privacy, in spite of the recommendations against address reuse).

They don't, it can be disabled on the user side.


It doesn't magically make Secure Enclave stop working (in fact, the opposite - Secure Enclave will nuke the data and brick the device if it suspects tampering). Even on the older 5C devices, that don't have Secure Enclave, they have a physical hardware limitation preventing more than one authentication attempt every 80ms, which makes even a 6 character alphanumeric passcode virtually impossible to brute-force.
@_date: 2016-02-17 19:56:07


They have to be able to access the phone to do this, as it requires authentication from the user. Doing it any other way (remotely, physically on the device) will lead to the tamper-detection routines kicking in.
Attacking an already unlocked phone is a lot easier - you can dump the decrypted memory ("lifting the JTAG" or whatever it's called), or just use a poisoned charger that operates as a sync device (as long as you can physically authenticate the trust mechanism for this when the phone is unlocked), or something like that. So this situation is more about attacking the device in the absence of the user / authentication.

For ages already (over a year?) transactions have included a % of new outputs in the ring, but blended with the real output. In other words, if you’re spending a new output on a ring size of 3 and using 30% new outputs, it won’t be your new output + another new output, as that would still stand out. On the other hand, if you’re spending an old output it will purposely select a new random output. This on ring size 3 (which is no longer allowed, but we’re talking hypothetically) it *always* looks like 1 new output, 2 old outputs. This makes the newer output problem equiprobable, especially at higher ring sizes and with weightings of like 60% newer outputs.

You have not understood my argument on any level.
My argument is that they're uneducated, and so they won't intuitively grasp the benefit of a hardware Bitcoin wallet over cash, and the amount of money required to educate that demographic on the benefits is prohibitively high.
On the other hand, the banked can more readily intuitively grasp the benefit of an electronic currency that is entirely in their control and that does not require or need a central operator, and they can more easily compare the fees they pay their bank with the fees they'd pay for a Bitcoin transfer.
Thus the unbanked should not be the target as it is an impossible wall to scale, but if the banked are targeted (early adopters, banked migrant workers) then there will eventually be a trickle-down effect to the unbanked.
Perhaps you should take the time to read and comprehend before running your mouth off and insulting me and people I'm close to.

There's a baseline you need to hit to provide the requisite functionality. Our memory usage is pretty lean (Laravel handles a lot of that), threads rarely exceed 12mb-14mb of memory. Caching reduces the efficiency of exhaustion attacks, as concurrent requests are handled very quickly (served by nginx straight from cache) without really using much memory.
Over and above those fundamentals, which are more for ensuring we don't die under load / massive scale-up, we rely on CloudFlare for DDoS protection. If we really decided to we could deploy our own anti-DDoS infrastructure using a mix of Route53 -&gt; keepalived -&gt; HHVM -&gt; Galera cluster (I've got webapps on my own infrastructure over several datacenters, not behind Incapsula/CloudFlare, that have handled ~30gbps DDoS attempts), but it's expensive and unnecessary for a cryptocurrency forum.
I'm also not sure how you think nodejs would magically be unaffected by having to dynamically serve thousands of simultaneous requests

1. I saw a talk by Elizabeth Rossario on Thursday on it, and she spoke at length about a future model with banking partners all over the world, where Bitcoin is abstracted away from the user (personally, I disagree with this model, I think the user should always be aware of the underlying medium of exchange that's assisting them). I don't know if their current model is m-pesa only, or if it supports local bank accounts too. I do know that it is tied to the local currency, so even in that future model I send Bob $100 US, and he receives 5000 KES (no clue what the actual exchange rate is).
2. There's very little 4G. In South Africa, which has a mature and cash-heavy mobile phone network, only the more major cities have LTE. 3G deployment is better, but there are vast swathes of national highway with no service on any network (like no phone calls, much less Internet). In terms of devices, Blackberry still has a strong presence, as they offered free BIS (Internet) for years, which captured a market. Smartphones are not ubiquitous and, whilst cheap Android devices are being sold in droves, the bulk of the smartphones in use are Blackberry and Nokia S60 devices. Hand-me-downs are a big thing, and it's not uncommon to see a 5 or 10 year old device. Even when smartphones *do* become ubiquitous, mobile data is pricey. Many do just fine with 10mb a month (most of the networks are starting to offer free access to WhatsApp and Facebook Zero / Facebook Mobile).
3. Well, the middle-to-upper income early adopters all have iPhones or modern Android devices, and 500mb or 1gb data bundles, so they're the people who are punting "Bitcoin will work in Africa" without thinking it through. Rossario, for instance, is an Ivy-league educated banker, with a trust fund or a slush fund of some sort, who thinks she knows what things are like on the ground because she's lived in Kenya for a few years. I've lived in South Africa all my life, and I do volunteer work in a rural settlement every week, but even I don't profess to know what will trickle down well and what won't. How come WhatsApp is basically ubiquitous, but Mxit (massive local chat service) is nearly dead? Maybe Bitcoin will succeed where m-pesa hasn't, but since it'll still require trust (eg. an SMS wallet) it's not superior to m-pesa in the eyes of the users (plus SMS or USSD is expensive for the service operator).

As we pointed out in [MRL-0001: A Note on Chain Reactions in Traceability in CryptoNote 2.0]( the privacy in Monero (and Bytecoin) is inherently linked to a fair distribution of mixable outputs.
As more than 83% of Bytecoin's txoset is controlled by a person (or persons) unknown to the community at large it means they can trivially deanonymise any Bytecoin transaction. The fact that they tried to hide their premine with asinine tales of a "secret launch on the darkweb" just cements them as scammers.

Fine: s/fair distribution/publicly visible distribution
An attacker can game 83% of Monero's txoset, but they'll be fighting a very hard and expensive uphill battle (ie. an attack akin to buying enough ASICs to control 51% of Bitcoin's mining network). The attack is possible, but over time the risk becomes "negligible" (speaking pragmatically, not cryptographically). On the other hand, the risk with Bytecoin is "absolute", and can not become "negligible".

Yes, but is that a compelling enough use-case? South Africans rarely need to send money internationally, the unbanked doubly-so. There is an influx of Zimbabweans and Malawians, but they don't seem to struggle to send money home.
Like I said, I really like BitSIM, but I think that targeting the unbanked is a mistake. They're generally not the early adopters, with very few exceptions. In fact, m-pesa is about the only relevant example I can think of, and that arose because migrant workers within a single country were using prepaid cellular airtime as a form of value transfer (buy airtime on one end -&gt; send code to family -&gt; they sell the airtime other end).
I remain unconvinced that a use-case for remittance among the unbanked exists at all, much less is a compelling one.
PS. Remittance among the banked may be a use-case, but then is a BitSIM required for that? BitPesa seems to have that wrapped up in a bundle, and they're specifically targeting both banked and m-pesa users.

As someone suggested it doing it via Monero below (and I'm a Monero core team member) I thought to price it out using ShapeShift and xmr.to

1. Went to xmr.to and created a new order for 1 BTC [[screenshot](
2. xmr.to indicated a total of 332.1155762 XMR would be needed for them to pay out the 1 BTC [[screenshot](
3. Went to ShapeShift.io and created a new order for 332.1155762 XMR, they indicated that I would have to pay 1.04297402 BTC [[screenshot](
(as an aside that last step can't just be executed, as ShapeShift doesn't yet support Monero's payment IDs, but as soon as they do you will be able to complete this loop in literally 2 steps)

- *[implemented]* sync with the Bitcoin-OTC Web of Trust
- *[implemented]* optional GPG authentication, both as a form of 2FA and as a way of syncing up with the Bitcoin-OTC WoT
- *[wip]* add a funding system to the forum that allows for per-task / per-feature / per-project funding (as [detailed in this post](
- *[wip]* implement Kramdown instead of just Markdown
- *[future]* be a proving ground for implementing future Monero sidechain/daughter-chain functionality [such as MoneroID and MoneroTrust](

To which they say: "I don't trust that, my cousin got caught when he stole a car and the police tracked his cellphone. If I use this I'm just going to get caught."
Let's not forget that the majority of the unbanked are also uneducated, so trying to convince them that their money will be secured by cryptography is not going to work. Bitcoin has to trickle down to them, once they see that the guy who owns the taxis uses it then they might consider it, but not before.

No country or continent is without its problems.
Many of the countries in Africa don't have insane leaders, and stuff like Boko Haram in Nigeria only affects a small part of the country. There are booming economies, and ever-growing numbers of consumers and creators.
Now here's the thing that's great about most countries in Africa: stuff like corruption happens. One could even argue that it's "common" in Africa. Except that it's not hidden, it gets done so sloppily that it gets exposed. In Africa you know who the bad people are, and there's no delusion. Ordinary citizens don't lie in their beds at night imagining that their government looks out for their best interests.

My last sentence speaks to that - BitPesa already solves the migrant worker issue, and they're on the ground in Kenya and some other middle-African countries. This requires a compelling use-case beyond migrant workers *precisely because those workers won't see any advantage between this and BitPesa*.
PS. the UN stats don't indicate how many of those ~240 million are unbanked, so again - where's the compelling use-case for the unbanked?

There *are* areas in Africa where this could be successful, but solving the accessibility and ease-of-use problems are only halfway there - getting over the inherent distrust of technology will be the second battle. Plus unless BitSIM are strongly pro-privacy they are going to really struggle once the taxman starts using the mobile network operators to give them info on how much people are receiving.
I don't think any of these challenges are untenable, I just think that unbanked pipe-dream is very far away, and will require a trickle-down from (banked) early adopters. I hope BitSIM isn't too ahead of its time:)

You're conflating two different topics, stick to one. An exit node can use sslstrip to degrade the connection to HTTP. At the same time, a more sophisticated attack exists on the open web where a case SSL certificate can be issued by a bad CA. These two can be combined, but the exit node attack works regardless.
Seriously, these exact attacks *have already taken place* on Tor, and continue to take place on a regular basis. Pretending they don't is either incredibly naive or purposely disingenuous.

I have no idea what you're asking or how you made the connection. I was stating a reason for them currently being unbanked, not a reason for them being unbanked in the future.
That notwithstanding, good luck trying to convince them that the national revenue service can't figure out their earnings by checking what payments they receive via SMS. They are (generally speaking) quite uneducated, and wouldn't understand cryptography even if you ELI5'd it. They don't even use the Internet much or at all, and then they do they use WhatsApp and Facebook and couldn't care less about HTTP vs. HTTPS.

I really like BitSIM, but I intensely dislike targeting "the world's unbanked". It has been my experience in South Africa (which has a large unbanked population) that many of them prefer to stay unbanked, often to avoid paying tax.
Also from a practical use-case, BitSIM has NFC baked in which is great for tap-to-pay, but I don't see minibus taxi drivers ([which pack like this]( and [pay by passing cash forward to the driver]( suddenly changing their business without a compelling reason.

Yep you're right - they've hemorrhaged cash here, lost a banking partner (Nedbank), and are now trying again without a banking partner.
If I had to make an educated assertion I'd say it's because they were pitching it at a low-income demographic, but in the absence of migrant workers what's the use-case for them? In other words, if my maid comes to me and asks me to pay her with m-pesa I'm going to say no, because it's too much effort. But if I was using m-pesa and I told her I'm going to use that to pay her it would be different. They should've targeted the disposable income + early adopter types and given *us* a compelling reason to use it.

Let us imagine that I am a chef at a restaurant, Café de Monero. Across the road from me is McDarkcoin. We both make food, but the quality of the food is clearly different to the educated observer.
In order to both maintain my current clientele and help the owners grow the restaurant I need to focus inwardly on expanding my lunch menu, trying out new cooking techniques, hiring an excellent sommelier, and ensuring only the best fresh ingredients are procured.
What you are so rudely and obnoxiously demanding is akin to demanding that I (the chef) spend time and effort analysing the ingredients that go into McDarkcoin's food in order to prove to everyone that their food is made from reprocessed garbage, even if it appears to look the part. What will that gargantuan and costly effort accomplish? Will McDarkcoin's customers suddenly flood to my restaurant? Or are they more likely to go two blocks down to Scamcoin King for their fix?

Just because something is *possible* doesn't mean it's *feasible* or that it'll lead to a good user-experience. More importantly, there is a massive difference between merely *distributing* an application and *decentralising* it.


Math helps what? The way you prevent Sybil attacks is by making those attacks VERY expensive. If you count votes based on the number of unique tips that's easily Sybil attacked. If you count it based on the total amount tipped...well, congratulations, you've successfully incentivised posts that benefit the highest bidder.
Google can't easily be gamed because their rules are in a black box that the public don't have access to. Every time someone tries something new to game Google they change the rules. In a decentralised cryptocurrency you can't do that (eg. when you starting blacklisting URLs you effectively centralise the system, as you are the decision maker, the control component).


Over-optimisation has nothing to do with it, you're misunderstanding the use of the word "expensive".
Combining PoS and PoW doesn't make the attack surface disappear, it just moves the variables around.
VeriCoin literally destroyed their fungibility by forking and rewinding the blockchain *because the attacker would have been able to trivially attack VeriCoin*. This would not have been plausible for a PoW cryptocurrency.

It's an extremely weak correlation, though, as you can't tell what was paid, to whom, where the funds came from, or even how much (although there's a stronger correlation that can be made with the amount, but that is something we're working on).
Nonetheless, the IP-relation risk is precisely why Monero is integrating i2p. You can see the work we've been doing towards that here:  (specifically, this is a C++ i2p router, thus removing the Java dependency).
The way it will work is that nodes will run on both i2p *and* regular TCP/IP by default. Blocks will travel over TCP/IP, transactions over i2p. However, nodes will indicate at handshake what they want to subscribe to (transactions and/or blocks), so a node can operate i2p-only or TCP/IP-only if need be.
The advantage of this structure is that i2p Sybil attacks can't be used to perform an isolation attack against a Monero node. At best it can be used to disrupt the flow of unmined transactions on i2p (although they'd still flow just fine on the rest of the network).

This is disingenuous. Most attacks of this nature involve corner cases or a set of circumstances that are relatively unlikely, but all that speaks to is the level of motivation of the attacker. As motivation increases the risk of attack becomes more likely.
Or to use a practical example: Ethereum is a steaming pile of poorly designed horse manure, but nobody is going to attack it unless it is suddenly worth $10 000 a coin (ie. an attacker is more motivated due to the expected reward of a successful attack).

The change from "legitimate" to "scam" is entirely down to the fundraising affair. Doing it as a security-but-not-really-a-security-no-we-promise-this-is-not-an-investment turns it into something between an "ICO" (almost always a scam) and an investment in a company selling snake oil.
Could money have been raised differently? Absolutely! A platform could easily have been created to allow for the funding of specific milestones by donators, with no option for return or reward. Or a flat target amount could've been raised, again via voluntary donations with no return.
Perhaps a lot less than the $15-million-odd that they raised, and maybe they wouldn't have fancy offices in various parts of the world, but they would be able to research and create technology (regardless of its feasibility) without erring on the side of snake-oil-peddling.

Sure. In the same vein, mobile phones have massively benefited the continent and made people's lives easier. But they needed to become cheap and accessible before they could become ubiquitous.
Thus in order for something like Bitcoin, or any blockchain-based technology, to become "helpful" in Africa it would first have to be accessible and ubiquitous elsewhere.

Cost-to-company is NOT the same as take-home-salary. Even with very generous stock options you're not going to hire a skilled senior developer $6k a month (and probably closer to $8k a month), and that's just their salary. Even if you're running incredibly lean you still have to factor in support services, peripheral benefits (health etc.), and once-off costs like HR fees, equipment (eg. laptop).
Admittedly most entrepreneurs make the mistake of hiring a top shelf team with no juniors to do the grunt work, which has the knock-on effect of leaving those highly skilled developers unchallenged and frustrated, performing perfunctory tasks for a large portion of their time. Whether or not that is the case here is unknown, but that doesn't change the fact that burning through 1.3 million in 20 months is trivial.
Not to single you out, but I've seen a few such comments in the Bitcoinsphere recently, and honestly it just highlights how few experienced businesspeople there are in this space.

Respectfully, in the comments on this post there is one mention of Monero (besides your response to it). If there were others they've been removed by the mods or the posters. I find the comments mostly enthusiastic, rather than "trying to pump".
Perhaps an analogy: if a friend of yours in conversation started talking about TransferWise, and how it's making international money transfers so cheap and easy, wouldn't you be excited to tell him about how Bitcoin can do the same?


Absolutely, and this is a point I've stressed when speaking about Monero at Bitcoin conferences. In fact, not to put too fine a point on it, there is no cryptocurrency on the planet that offers the same hashing network security as Bitcoin.
That said, even in its current form Monero offers substantially more privacy than Bitcoin, at a level of risk and at a set of trade-offs that many find acceptable. Monero will probably fail in the long run (the most likely outcome if we're being pragmatic), but that does not mean it is not incredibly useful right now.
For example: if you purchase things with Bitcoin, and wish to enhance your privacy, then it is completely viable to keep a small amount in a Monero hot wallet, and use services like xmr.to and shapeshift.io to complete your purchases.


Absolutely true. With a scant 18 months of life and development behind it, Monero is the functional equivalent of Bitcoin in the summer of 2010, albeit with the benefit of being able to observe Bitcoin's history.


That link is empty, perhaps it has been removed?

The thing you're forgetting is that nobody looks *at the URL*, they look at the browser bar for certain tell-tale signs. A padlock as a favicon is enough to convince even somewhat alert users that their connection is secured, and they can go about their business.
If your solution involves literally clicking on the URL bar to reveal the full URL *then your solution is rubbish*.
Also, even if you *did* reveal the URL we know that HTTPS can be compromised by CAs issuing bad certs (eg. DV certs where they're tricked into validating the domain, OV certs from organisations legitimately registered in other countries).
Now here's the bit you're not thinking through: in the course of normal browsing these attacks are not such a big deal, because your connection to the Internet is somewhat unmolested. If, however, you're using Tor then your connection to the wider Internet is far from untouched - in fact, an exit node is in an ideal position to MITM you, and malicious exit nodes exist for this very reason.
You're not thinking adversarially, otherwise you'd understand why DNSSEC and DANE exist as steps in solving these problems on clearnet.

lol, are you out of your mind? In the real world there's this thing called "freedom of speech" that protects me when I'm stating the obvious.
Let me be frank, and feel free to "take me to court" over these statements:
1. Darkcoin is an outright instamined scam, with [5% of the currency mined out in the first 8 hours]( and whose block reward [does not even vaguely relate to the block reward they claim](
2. They provide no cryptographic proofs for their claims of privacy, and rely heavily on a desperate attempt to shroud the risks by continuously beating the probabilistic analysis drum, [whilst discounting (or outrightly ignoring) attacks of a combinatorial, temporal, or extrapolated nature.](
3. The MasterNode incentives are ill-conceived and [are designed in such a way that the MasterNode network will, at best, implode]( and end up controlled by a small cabal of astute operators who practice sufficiently competent opsec.


Maybe if crypto gets large enough scammers like Evan Duffield and the greedy idiots that blindly follow him can be relegated to a little island somewhere and left to fend for themselves.


Clearly I am the dim-witted one in this argument.

You're again completely missing the point, and trying to reference m-pesa to support your argument is illogical - they are an outlier at best, as evidenced by m-pesa's complete inability to take off in other countries (such as South Africa).


They don't need to, because m-pesa has already had a trickle down (or, more specifically, a trickle sideways). Additionally, m-pesa has always been denominated in KES, so it's a completely different beast.
The mechanism I'm describing is exactly what made m-pesa work in Kenya but not work in South Africa. A "trickle up" is something that simply doesn't happen, and continuing to beat that drum is nonsensical.


How many times have you been to Africa? Have you had a discussion with an uneducated, unbanked African about Bitcoin?
You're very quick to denounce me as arrogant, but clearly you don't base this opinion on first-hand knowledge. You cannot possibly know what it is like to live in Africa, nor can you possibly grasp why some things work on this continent and why some don't.
Your attitude comes across as distinctly American.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:30:16
The CA trust issue is a real concern, though: 
Confirming the .onion is an absolute; you know that you are, without a doubt, talking to that server. Short of the server being hijacked your traffic is impervious to misdirection.
In other words: trusting Tor routing not to be broken is a (cryptographically) negligible risk, whereas hoping that your CA isn't compromised and you aren't being tricked via an MITM sslstrip has no viable cryptographic certainty (at least none worth talking about in this context).

Local news outlets are pretty good (eg. [iol.co.za]( and [news24.com]( both have reasonable, unbiased coverage of the continent).
My go-to resource, though, is [AfricaCheck]( whose stated mission is to fact-check reports and public figures on the continent. Their initial focus has been southern Africa, but more recently they've opened up operations in east and west Africa. You'd be surprised at how often western media pulls numbers out a hat (and hey, even local news sources and government sources get stuff grossly incorrect). AfricaCheck tells the real story, no matter how frightening or encouraging it is.
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:19:48
You are extremely incorrect, I have to agree with here. HTTPS does *not* help, but the contrariwise is true: with the (correct) .onion address you don't need SSL at all (since end-to-end encryption is inherently part of Tor).
sslstrip-based attacks can be EXTREMELY clever. For instance, one such attack replaced the favicon for compromised sites with a picture of a lock, and because the favicon appeared on the URL bar it appeared to be an SSL-protected site even to those who would otherwise be paying attention. There are no dialog boxes or warnings if the exit node uses sslstrip, so it's not inherently obvious.
Additionally, even if we disregard the sslstrip issue it is still surprisingly easy for compromised / dodgy CAs to issue certificates that they have no right to issue (see: 
The correct solution is for users to double-check the .onion address they're using, not to trust their exit node and perform a host of additional checks.

So 443 days of development (63 weeks or so) has resulted in a vastly unfinished product.

See, you can use the scale argument with Bitcoin too:)
Two salient points:
1. You *can* prune Monero. You have to retain the txoset and the key image set, so you prune O(keyimageset+txoset) as opposed to Bitcoin's O(utxoset), but you absolutely can prune.
2. You don't *need* to prune Monero, necessarily, as we're working on related systems that shift metadata bulk off mainchain. For a better overview see our research goals on our Design and Development goals page: 
Also the massive attack was block 202612, which was late 2014, and the network chose the correct fork within 30 minutes. A patch was deployed to all important nodes (eg. miners, DNS seeders, etc.) a few hours later.

- "decentralise all the things" is **not** an admirable goal, especially seeing as how technology is not at a state where every type of system *can* be decentralised
- appcoins are unsustainable and unnecessary
- the minute you introduce any Reddit-style voting you either centralise that or you have to have on-chain voting
- further to that, paid-for votes are trivially gamed, corporations will be able to push their own links to the top whilst unsponsored links (the ones you actually want to discover on a Reddit-style interface) will flounder at the bottom
- PoS is unnecessary for this
- given the intended use, PoS just opens up attack vectors you don't want to have to worry about
- a Bitcoin-style blockchain is a terribly expensive storage mechanism, which makes it unsustainable

is correct - if I pay with my South African credit card online it is rejected about 30% of the time for "fraud risk". It used to be much worse, nowadays some of them at least send me a message and ask for additional verification (eg. a picture of the card).
Incidentally, this has caused me to make most of my online purchases with PayPal, or to seek out places that accept Bitcoin. Unfortunately much of the time it ends up being better for me to purchase with PayPal (if it's the first time I'm buying from a merchant) due to the buyer protection, and most merchants don't offer a discount with Bitcoin to make it worth my while taking a risk on them.

Discussion of the minutiae of the scenario is pointless and a waste of time.

Pretty much what said. We'll build out a close-to-Bitcoin-compatible API, where instead of returning an address for ```getnewaddress``` it can return a payment ID (optionally base58 encoded, and specifically crafted, if the software you're plugging into insists on it). Similarly, ```listreceivedbyaddress``` can return something similar to what ```get_bulk_payments``` currently does. We're also going to be adding ```walletnotify``` and ```blocknotify``` functionality, so sites that depend on that will be able to use it.

I can't agree with that logic...if Bitcoin starts to decline as a reserve currency, and some altcoin appears to be a suitable candidate to replace it, there will naturally be a steady and progressive flow of funds from the one to other, and an ongoing conversion / replacement of services.

Statements of fact are not "trailer park behaviour" and "slinging mud". I have only garnered the modicum of respect I have precisely because I have the knowledge and experience to state these facts, and the level of accomplishment to warrant my forthrightness.
You're conflating the situation with one of an aggressor, when I am merely *responding to someone who asked for a technical response*. That makes *you* the FUDster responding to my statement, not the other way around.
To answer your statement that I must "physically break Darksend" I'm afraid that's not how cryptography...or life, really, works. The onus is on Darkcoin to mathematically prove their model, at least under the random oracle assumptions.

You're an unknown entity who has not pointed to anything you've accomplished, produced, achieved, written about, spoken on, developed, researched, or created. You've presented no evidence of your technical capability to analyse the OpenAlias standard, nor have you presented an opinion on the standard, you've merely resorted to baseless ad hominem attacks.
In fact, to set the record straight:
- btcXchange.ro was never hacked. Users were asked to withdraw funds, no funds were lost. Per their [post on Bitcointalk]( (Google translated) - "This is due to misunderstanding with our main programmer who has resigned."
- You're welcome to write Monero off as a "shitcoin", but seeing as how it is not a fork of Bitcoin and uses none of Bitcoin's code you'd be hard-pressed to justify that view. Unless you think Bitcoin has some sort of monopoly on all cryptocurrency research and development?
- You laughably imply that you are somehow in a similar position to Andreas Antonopoulos. That's incredibly arrogant, but even if it were true it's hard to [have much respect for Andreas' technical ability]( You do yourself a disservice by trying to make comparisons to a public figure, doubly so when that public figure is a poor example of someone in a position to analyse the standard.

I can't tell if you're trolling (the MLP jab was funny:) but on the off-chance you're not:


So let's just make sure we understand what this "scam" entails:
1. Create an open and freely available aliasing standard that drastically simplifies Bitcoin's usage for ordinary, non-crypto people, allowing them to make payments to addresses like ric or donate.getmonero.org
2. Ensure it supports all cryptocurrencies, and even non-cryptocurrency aliasing
3. Make it really easy for everyone - regardless of their level of technical knowledge - to create an alias if they own a domain
4. Allow for aliases to be created using decentralised systems such as NameCoin (thus [squaring Zooko's triangle](
5. Design a method for protecting user's alias resolution privacy (via DNSCrypt), and host a stub for those DNSCrypt resolvers that support NameCoin resolution as well
6. Create a website that documents this open standard
7. Spend the time and effort to [implement the standard for Electrum]( for free, so that Electrum users can make payments to aliases instead of addresses
8. Spend the time and effort to create an easy to deploy web-based API for resolution, release the source code: 
We don't make any money from this, and I personally have spent a ton of time, money, and effort on creating a standard that makes Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) easier to use.

You've just described how [Monero]( operates. All transaction outputs (including the change coming back to you) are split up by magnitude (powers of 10), and the "destination" for each output is computed based on the recipient's public keys as well as a random value. Thus even if 5 of the outputs in a transaction are going to the same person they all *appear* to be going to different individuals.
Specifically: a Monero address is actually two public keys, a view and a spend key, serialised down into the single address. Let's call those public keys A and B. For each output in the transaction we calculate a random r ∈ [1,l−1]. We then compute the destination P using a hash function Hs and a basepoint, ie. P = Hs(rA)G+B.
A practical example is [this transaction]( as you can see the "key" column in the Outputs table isn't a list of addresses, but the computed destination for each output. I'd guess that most of those outputs are destined for the same address, but it's impossible to tell which or even group them together in any meaningful way. And all of it requires no masternodes:)

I suppose it's one of the things I was implying...I mean, it's gotten to a point where Darkcoin trolls think it's an insult to say that we spend 70% of our time talking about how cryptography is the answer to everything:-P
More to the point, though, we (as in the core team) aren't delusional enough to imagine that this is some sort of race that will have any meaning in 20 years time, and that is why we don't believe ourselves to be in "competition" with Bitcoin or anyone else. Most altcoins, including Darkcoin, will be nothing but a bootnote in long-forgotten journals. Monero may, too, eventually fade into nothingness, and *that's ok*.
We're not fighting for relevance, marketcap, or wannabe cryptocurrency "investors". We're fighting to deliver the best tools and systems we can to ensure the ongoing safety of the funds our users have (in effect) entrusted to us. If nobody uses Monero that's annoying, but it won't stop us from delivering a fantastic ecosystem. Monero is an experiment that we *hope* will be successful, and that's it. It's not a race, it's not a pissing contest, it's just an ongoing exercise in offering a more private alternative to Bitcoin that is at least worthy of wearing the "*crypto*currency" badge.

I agree that the level of obfuscation that would create is good enough for most purposes, but I think it's naive to say that it would thwart an attacker with the resources of a nation state. In fact, I would hazard that it wouldn't thwart the resources of a motivated criminal.
If you are targeted by either it is unlikely that most people would sufficiently defend themselves against the attacker *knowing* what their holdings are (eg. by compromising their computer), but by leveraging technologies such as hardware wallets you can prevent them from *stealing* your holdings.

@_date: 2015-10-13 13:55:24


Yes, you don't *have* to make it merge-mined, but it's generally the desirable course (otherwise what's the point of making it a sidechain;)


It's not that per se, it's just that it exposes metadata that would otherwise not be trivially attainable. In other words, think of the blockchain like a big Sudoku board. If you're an attacker (and this could be anyone, blockchain analysis services, a motivated criminal, a TLA, whoever) then you slowly fill in as much data as you can acquire over time, and eventually hope you can guess the missing pieces.
With Bitcoin this is pretty bad, because you can get info that's out in the open, such as when people put their addresses up on a forum for tips. Similarly, Bitcoin change address usage reveals more links between addresses used by a single wallet (ie. later on when multiple change addresses are used as inputs in a tx you can assume they're all controlled by the same person).
With Monero you have very little to go on. At best a motivated attacker can compromise a high-volume entity, such as an exchange, and make a note of every transaction it produces (although that feels like it would be a waste of effort, there's a lot more they can gleam once the exchange is compromised;)
Two-way pegs are a problem in that it provides additional metadata out in the open, available to a wider group of potential attackers. That's not to say we won't add support for federated pegging or similar (once it's actually available in Bitcoin), but it *does* mean that we aren't going to make it any sort of primary vehicle. Instead, services such as ShapeShift, LocalBitcoins, and cryptocurrency exchanges provide an additional non-public layer to the peg.

- passive privacy, your transaction inputs are mixed with outputs on the blockchain, so you can sign a massively private transaction whilst remaining offline
- all transactions are private by default, optionally transparent. You can reveal the details on a per-wallet and/or pre-transaction basis
- dynamically sized block limits, so no need to worry about fixed block limits like Bitcoin and Darkcoin have
- we created and were the first to implement the [OpenAlias]( standard, for all cryptocurrencies, that means that you never have to remember or use a long Monero / Bitcoin / Darkcoin / whatever address
- we have actually stuck to the emission curve promised at the outset, which means our social contract is intact
- ongoing cryptography research to continue to improve Monero and continue to provide our users with true, cryptographically sound privacy; see the [Monero Research Lab research publications](
- a PoW algorithm that genuinely closes the performance gap between CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs
- a PoW algorithm that doesn't have massive potential pre-image attacks (you don't just combine hashing algorithms, otherwise you end up with [a situation like this]( - to quote his conclusion: 'The underlying problem is that combining cryptographic operators that weren't designed to be combined can be disastrous.

Yes, plus the client connects to multiple servers and will rotate through them, so you'd need collusion between the servers to do anything weird. Also server operators don't get paid, so there's no incentive for them to do anything outrightly weird, and the worst they can do is not relay your transactions and give you false address history / balances.

Probably not. I'm quite biased in this, but as an example: I don't have particularly libertarian or anarchistic tendencies. Yet my [continued work on Monero]( is because I also believe that financial privacy should be a right and not a privilege. For some reason I'm completely fine sharing pictures of my house on Twitter, but balk at the thought of anyone knowing how much I earn or what I spend my money on (except by indirect observation if they're friends, of course).
But we (as in Monero) also recognise that there's more to it than just fungibility / privacy, so we're also working on some cool stuff that leverages the privacy in Monero to provide parallel systems, and hopefully there will be some practicality to those (see the research goals on the [Design and Development Goals page](

Those two prefixes cannot possibly mean the same thing.
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:38:41
An insecure sidechain (ie. one with a weak mining network) isn't worth the risk. Thus Monero can remain as a hedge, of sorts, against potential Bitcoin problems (eg. secp256k1 issues that can't be forked away from fast enough).
As I mentioned, though, we are definitely open to adding two-way pegging between Monero and Bitcoin, but I do not think it wise to have a scenario where the failure of one would mean the failure of the other.

There has been no evidence presented - at all - that the NSA has been involved in the development of CryptoNote. Additionally, the cryptography it uses is old - some of the ring signature cryptography is decades old - and has been well vetted. Furthermore, Monero eschews the actual crypto code implementations that were in the CryptoNote reference implementation (although, to be fair, they were all basically just reference implementations, nothing particularly weird or ground-breaking) and replaces them with SUPERCOP ref10 implementations and similar.

Nonetheless, I have been involved in the cryptocurrency space for many years, and in cryptography / netsec / FOSS projects far longer, so take these observations accordingly.
1. Darkcoin had a problematic launch: [2 million Darkcoin were mined in the first day]( (incidentally, there are around 2 800 Darkcoin emitted daily right now, so that should give some level of contrast). This may not seem to relate to your question, but it is important to establish the legitimacy and technical competency of the developer. The fact that the [block reward does not match either of the three block reward formulae published by the developer]( is worrying. This points to an outright scam at worst, pure incompetence at best.
2. When dealing with a *crypto*currency you need to be able to cryptographically and mathematically prove a particular claim. So in [the original Bitcoin whitepaper]( Satoshi was able to mathematically prove the validity of the longest chain rule. The rest of his cryptographic claims were backed by the papers he quotes ([Adam Back's Hashcash paper in particular]( Darkcoin has no cryptographic proofs of their claims. This is important, because a cryptocurrency is a manifestation of cryptographic theory, not the other way around. If you try and shoe-horn it the other way around you'll likely find your model unsafe under [the most basic of assumptions](
3. The developer seems to eschew well-defined, anti-fragile, and proven Bitcoin concepts (eg. building a model based on paying for services via micropayment channels) for bizarre models that are poorly implemented and fragile (eg. payments based on uptime make a MasterNode a ripe target for DDoS attacks null-routing that IP).
4. I have seen no evidence that InstantX transactions are not susceptible to malleability. This means that it is trivially easy to disrupt every InstantX transaction, and the network will fall back to processing them as "normal" transactions.
5. This malleability approach also allows for easy forking of the network if you own a subset of MasterNodes, whereby your malicious MasterNodes vote for both of your transactions and feed those votes to two groups of miners. The claim made in the InstantX "whitepaper" is that the conflicting messages will "cancel each other out", but once the network is forked that isn't the case, as half the conflicting messages won't even be received by the one part of the forked network. By continuing to run this group of malicious nodes, feeding sets of InstantX transactions that appear to be voted in as valid, you can keep the network split indefinitely.
6. The entire basis for "anonymising" transactions is based on clients being online at a given point in time, which means that those clients are also open to leaking information via temporal association.
7. The developer seems to have a grave lack of understanding when it comes to the danger of incentives. The clearest example of this is [this table of MasterNode ROI]( As you can clearly see, a MasterNode's ROI is substantially higher when there are fewer MasterNodes. Thus there is clear incentive for a MasterNode operator to systematically attack and destroy other MasterNodes, but not so much that the network ceases to exist. Just enough to double or triple his ROI. Incidentally, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as in a hypothetical future where Darkcoin is processing thousands of transactions an hour it will require quite a hefty server to act as a MasterNode. The fewer MasterNodes there are, the more work individual MasterNodes will have to do, which means that those run by non-technical people or on cheap VPS's will be the first to go, eventually leaving a group of big boys with big guns operating the remaining MasterNodes.
8. We've already seen ample evidence of law enforcement turning seemingly anonymous people into informants (eg. Sabu), hacking servers, and infiltrating systems in other ways. It is safe to say that LEA could also outrightly purchase large portions of the MasterNode network. It is impossible to tell which MasterNodes are real and which are owned by LEA (in perpetuity). Unfortunately it appears that the developer's line of reasoning, with respects to "how much" privacy Darkcoin gives you, started with the assumption that a supermajority of the MasterNodes are honest / not being watched / not infiltrated by LEA. This leaves open a huge, gaping hole whereby all of the "mixing" MasterNodes are involved in can be revealed by an owned / compromised majority. I can guarantee that the bulk of all MasterNode operators do not know even the first piece of opsec required to keep from your tin from being tampered with.
9. MasterNodes can be tricked into believing they can no longer accept new connections, simply by filling up all their file descriptors. It is somewhat trivial to force new connections to a group of MasterNodes under your control.
10. The developer has no clue how dangerous and stupid it is to chain hashing algorithms, as you open them up to pre-image attacks among other things. As a security researcher who [discovered a flaw in chained hashing algorithms in PHP]( concluded: *"The underlying problem is that combining cryptographic operators that weren't designed to be combined can be disastrous. Is it possible to do so safely? Yes. Is it a good idea to do it? No. This particular case is just one example where combining operations can be exceedingly dangerous. But the bottom line: never roll your own crypto. It can have fatal consequences."*
Of course, Darkcoin proponents try reply to comments like these with accusations of "FUD" and nonsensical dismissals that occasionally contain a smattering of hand-waving and technical jargon to try make it appear they know what they're talking about. Which I will, understandably, ignore and refuse to engage. Instead, I ask only that the onus remain on Darkcoin to cryptographically and mathematically prove that their model, for all claims, remains valid and secure.
Edit: corrected first point to reflect that 2 million Darkcoin were mined in a day, not in 8 days. I had forgotten that it was instamined due to low diff, it only normalised after many retargets towards the end of the day. Removed point about code not compiling, per - thanks for your help!

You're stating conclusions without pointing to actual research that agrees; I've pointed to the opposite. Per-kb fees will fall as Bitcoin's value grows, so your entire point is both incorrect and, frankly, far-fetched.

It's an open standard. There's no code you need to trust, it's literally just a standard that involves a specifically formatted TXT record backed by DNSSEC.

Thank you - and I agree that the price of the security is terribly high. So my thinking is that the high price should get you a bit more than just Bitcoin's security / tamper-resistance, which is why we (Monero) add privacy to that. If the high price gets you a global, secure, tamper-resistant network providing a completely private store of value and medium of exchange, but at a very high relative cost, then the number of transactions the network handles should be appropriately low.
However, this is no different to, say, the high cost of moving physical cash overseas - it's doable, but it's a complete pain. And yet we can move large values overseas by using IOUs or systems layered on top of the traditional cash system. In much the same way, I think that Bitcoin (and Monero, by extension) are incredibly powerful base systems upon which scalable sub-systems can be added, hopefully while still allowing the average user to use that base layer if they want.

Oh you poor, poor child. I know what CT is, and it absolutely does nothing to make Bitcoin untraceable or unlinkable.
Let's refer, again, to those two specific points:




You claim that CT somehow provides this, but in doing so you demonstrate that you have a massive misunderstanding of what CT is and what it does. Thankfully, Greg makes it quite clear in that write-up you linked to: "*Confidential Transactions improves the situation by making the transaction amounts private*"
That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. It masks the transaction amounts. ***Every transaction is still traceable, every transaction is still linkable***.
In fact, that write-up explains *how* you could start to approach Monero's level of transactional privacy using Confidential Transactions when it says: "*It is also compatible with CoinJoin and CoinSwap,* ***allowing for transaction graph privacy as well***"
If that is hard to understand, let me explain as clearly as possible: Confidential Transactions does NOTHING to prevent transaction linking and tracing. The very document you linked to as proof says so quite clearly. All CT does is mask the transaction amounts.
I'm so sorry that you got this so grossly incorrect, but that was the reason I tackled you on that first point, because I knew you to be incorrect.
If you'd like, I can look at your other points now, but I'm fairly certain you're going to have some snarky "SFYL" response instead of actually reading and understanding where you went wrong.

We've been tweaking our static builds lately, there's a lot of work and broad platform testing we still need to go through to catch edge-cases like this. For consensus critical libraries (which technically OpenSSL is, as it is used in libunbound which can have a knock-on effect on consensus if it introduces changes) we're going to start linking them all in statically, arbitrary stuff like miniupnpc will stay dynamic for release/debug targets and only be linked statically for release-static/debug-static targets.
If you don't mind digging around on the command-line I'd encourage you to compile it yourself (if you don't have a wad of RAM then the [blockchain branch]( is preferable, although we're a few days away from merging it). If instead you just want to play, send some transactions, observe them on the blockchain, and so on, then [MyMonero]( is our stop-gap solution as we continue to build the Monero platform out from the very raw and unpolished state it is in now.
If you want to get a sense as to what our development and research goals look like, then this is worth taking a look:

And, just to point out, I'm one of the core team members on [Monero]( which is an "altcoin" (although it shares none of Bitcoin's code), so I'm certainly not against altcoins in principle or purpose.

Let's turn this around, because I think you don't understand the reason for this.
What do you think happens when Bitcoin's block reward drops to less than the combined fees, and miners are no longer incentivised to mine? One option: mining profitability becomes progressively more and more -EV, miners fall off the grid, and the network becomes progressively less secure. Your "savings" become worthless.
On the other hand, with Monero you might not have some artificial scarcity where your savings magically grow because there's literally more and more people trying to swim in the same tiny pool, but at the same time you'll have a store of value and a medium of exchange with less volatility.

Yes - I'm under the impression that you can have a two-way peg without merge-mining, which suits our use-case much better. It's not so much the risk of attack that concerns us, but more retaining our independence so that *our* security model isn't at-risk.

That's not entirely true, companies like GoDaddy make it stupidly easy to register a domain - you can bet their Nascar advertising isn't to appeal to tech-heads. They'll even handle DNSSEC for you for $16/year for up to 5 domains (premium DNS). CloudFlare is beta-testing DNSSEC, so ease-of-access is growing.
Also, whilst it is only a cottage industry right now, there are fledgling efforts to provide OpenAlias-compatible aliases to everyone, eg.  (not my site)
Your commentary on DNSCrypt is confusing - are you not thinking of something else? DNSCrypt is an open-source standard by OpenDNS, and is based on the same cryptography and mechanisms that djb's [DNSCurve]( uses (it specifically benefits from Curve25519, and leverages Salsa20 and Poly1305 for encryption and authentication). DNSCrypt allows users to perform DNS resolution without using their ISP's DNS server, or even their own, and everything is encrypted from the initial request to the final recursion (if any). So pretty much, unless djb and OpenDNS and screeds of cryptographers have messed up, DNSCrypt is quite safe. Its only role here is to protect user privacy during alias lookups.
With regards to domain confiscation, the threat model is no different to email. In fact, if you're paranoid it's significantly better than email, as you can use Namecoin / DIANNA / P2P-DNS instead of ICANN's TLDs, and you never need to worry about domain confiscation. The vast majority of users won't have to worry about domain confiscation, and if they are the victim of domain confiscation (or even domain hijacking) then they'd have to treat it as if their email address was compromised and inaccessible, and they'd reach out to everyone who may want to make a payment to the inaccessible alias.
The same goes for expires domains - the onus is on the user to secure and maintain their alias. Thankfully there is a sliding scale in the model from *absolutely trusted* (eg. using a provider like xmr.link) to *semi-trusted* (eg. using an ICANN domain) to *semi-untrusted* (eg. using an ICANN [domain from]( a country [unlikely to hand it over]( using a good registrar like Gandi, and securing it with DNSSEC) to *absolutely untrusted* (eg. Namecoin, DIANNA, P2P-DNS).
I doubt DNSCrypt needs an audit, although you are welcome to tell djb and OpenDNS that there are several unattended issues in their protocols so that it can be patched. OpenAlias, as a standard, doesn't really need an audit, as it can't lead to many knock-on issues (from a standard perspective) unless TXT records suddenly can't have certain characters. Individual implementations are always prone to failure, but if they're doing anything with TXT records except parsing them for a specific token they're gonna have a bad time.
The Electrum plugin and the OpenAlias API source code isn't designed for mission-critical installations, and I think it's safe to say that even a junior developer can write their own implementation (lookup TXT record -&gt; check for OA prefix -&gt; parse key-value pairs -&gt; check DNSSEC trust chain). It's exceedingly simple, and exceedingly hard to screw the implementation up (although stranger things have been known to happen;)

There's no legal burden of proof called "undeniable proof", so I'm not sure how you could make a comparison. Nonetheless, on the face of it your statement seems incorrect.
Beyond reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof standard in western courts. It is not to be confused with "reasonable suspicion", which it appears to be how you're viewing the term.
In the USA, for instance, "reasonable suspicion" is all that is required for the police to briefly stop and search you. Similarly, "probably cause" is required for the police officer to arrest you.
When it comes to legal decisions, though, none of these are remotely tenable. One of the most common basic standards for a burden of proof is the "balance of probabilities", or the "preponderance of evidence". This is used in many child support cases and civil cases in the USA, and here in South Africa it's used in company disciplinary hearings and in independent arbitration hearings that may result from a company's labour-related decision. At its most basic this means that the arbitrator / decision maker has to determine whether there is a greater than 50% probability that the evidence and statements presented by one party is true, when viewed against the other party's evidence and statements.
One step up from that is "clear and convincing evidence", and is often used in more complex civil cases, or in matters such as paternity and child custody. This is where the judge has to be convinced that the one party's evidence is substantially more probable to be true than not. The decisions that are made at this level are likely to have major long-term consequences on the parties, and so decisions must not be taken lightly. That said, these decisions are mostly resolved with monetary damages, so it's not quite at the level of the final standard.
Which brings us to "beyond reasonable doubt". This is a standard that is so high it is used for all criminal proceedings, and almost nowhere else. It requires an impartial and careful consideration of all the evidence presented, and the test *must* fail if there is a lack of convincing evidence. After this consideration, the judge or jury has to have absolutely no "reasonable doubt". In other words, they can have some unreasonable doubts (eg. what if the person has a twin that they don't know about, what if this is an occurrence of the 10^13 possibility of a full SGM+ DNA coincidental match), but those must be so far-fetched that they can be disregarded. In fact, this goes so deep that, if the only evidence is circumstantial, the judge or jury have to be so convinced of the facts presented that they are able to exclude *every reasonable hypothesis and inference*, and are finally left with no conclusion other than the party's guilt.

Markets are irrational, and can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. They certainly aren't any indication of technical expertise or experience. In addition, Bitcoin has been around since Jan '09, Monero since April '14, only an incredibly naive or incredibly stupid person would dare hold their market caps as an indication of anything - I trust you are neither of those qualities.


That is nonsense. There is absolutely no reason for any "dev. support" to migrate to Monero merely because we say we want to be a sidechain. Same goes for the network effect - how do you imagine that would work? Newcomers are barely beginning to understand Bitcoin, and now they must suddenly be interested into this other thing that is kinda-Bitcoin-but-not-but-actually-mined-with-it-hold-on-let-me-find-you-a-YouTube-video?!?


Were Monero merely a cryptocurrency that might hold some water. But it isn't, so that argument doesn't fly. If you aren't aware of our research and development goals I can point you in their direction.


Successful as in they suddenly, and magically, garnish decades of peer review?
I thought not.


Pragmatically, none of these scenarios is in the least bit realistic. Your entire argument sounds like the sort of discussion I imagine would have occurred at the Blockbuster / Netflix meeting in 2000. That's not to say that Bitcoin is the next Blockbuster, who knows if it is, but it is definitely naive to imagine that Monero cannot be successful (albeit in a niche) without irrevocably tethering itself to Bitcoin.
What good is a hedge against the failure of something when your success is cryptographically tied to its success?

It's not impossible, and it's not ridiculous. The problem is that you're thinking in "transactions", which I admit is the typical way of approaching this problem, and then you're wondering (rightly so) how there can be plausible deniability in the absence of a large anonymityset.
One of the chief advantages that Monero has is that privacy is an integral part of the protocol, and thus everyone is a participant (willing or unwilling) in the global anonymityset. Doing it any other way (opt-in) means you have a limited set of participants. Imagine, if you will, a CoinJoin transaction (whether initiated by Dash or JoinMarket or anything else) where there are 10 participants, most of whom can be trivially identified by blockchain analysis, exchange subpoenas etc. They're trivially identified because *they have poor personal opsec*, which means your transactional privacy relies on the opsec of others.
Now if those that can be identified can be written off as disinteresting, the remaining one or two become the suspects or culprits or whatever. Plausible deniability only works if there is a very, very large anonymityset, because people are *very bad* at opsec, and information is *very good* at freeing itself:)
In order to understand how Monero masks transactions you have to first understand how it deals with transaction outputs, and then how it deals with transaction inputs.
*Note: in the explanation below I use terms like "no way" or "impossible". I do not mean it is literally impossible to do the thing I am claiming, I mean that the risk is "cryptographically negligible", which is the same risk as accidentally creating a Bitcoin address that has 50 000 Bitcoin in, or brute-force reversing a properly hashed password. This also does not mean that such a thing is not possible via an exploit, a break in the cryptography, a novel attack, or via some other mechanism that does not involve blockchain analysis.*
**Transaction Outputs**
In a typical Bitcoin transaction you have outputs going to an address. Now imagine a perfect world where there is no address reuse - every output would go to a different address, right? Monero is like that, but it adds two things:
1. Outputs to a single address are split up into powers of 10. In other words, if in a single transaction I am sending 123.45 XMR to one address, and 6.78 to another, I will have a total of 8 outputs: 100 XMR, 20 XMR, 3 XMR, 0.4 XMR, 0.05 XMR, 6 XMR, 0.7 XMR, 0.08 XMR. With me so far?
2. Instead of each of these outputs going to an "address", they instead go to a seemingly random "destination". An oversimplified explanation of how this destination is constructed, on a per output basis, is to take the two public keys that form a Monero address, combine it with a randomly generated value, and hash the result. Because the recipient has their corresponding private keys, they can test this hash to determine whether an output is meant for them or not.
Thus, the transaction example I gave in (1) might have outputs that look like this, with the destination hash shortened for brevity:
Amount | Destination
100 XMR | 119b32fba363
20 XMR | 84f81499b4d9
6 XMR | 27c7e83f3ad0
3 XMR | 761fd1363f28
0.7 XMR | 81bf9dd93919
0.4 XMR | c4ef7e70c132
0.08 XMR | 166238a1d768
0.05 XMR | f3f2d97e7275
Plus this transaction doesn't even include any change - there might be another few outputs coming back to our own wallet as change, and they appear to be the same as these other outputs! Since we cannot identify *where* the transactions are going without knowing the data used to build the destinations, we can essentially send to ourselves each time with an attacker not being able to tell as much.
**Transaction Inputs**
Now here's where the real magic comes in. When constructing a transaction we also need transaction inputs, which are just previous transaction outputs that we're now spending. Through the magic of ring signatures, though, what Monero does is make each input appear to come from a number of previous outputs.
So to simplify it: in our previous example we're spending a total of 130.23 XMR. Now let's say I have outputs in my wallet of 100, 30, and 0.5 XMR that I can spend (the 0.27 XMR difference would be the transaction fee in this example, although the actual tx fee is much lower, 0.01 XMR per kb).
For the input of 100 XMR we find all the previous 100 XMR outputs on the blockchain, and we select a few of them to "mix" with. I [ran a parse on the blockchain a few weeks ago]( to see how many mixable outputs there are, and there are 21 000 outputs of 100 XMR available to mix with. But let's say I pick the default mixin of 3, which means that input will appear to come from 1 of 4 possible outputs (my real one plus 3 others).
Thus, the transaction inputs for our example transaction might look something like the following:
Amount | Previous Output
100 XMR | 056db3c3fd1f
  | 1f1a9a6c6fca
  | 13f5995ccd17
  | 20599de2deae
 | 
30 XMR | f800e70b1a92
  | d103c610096a
  | ba52b529adc4
  | dd06f309b2d1
 | 
0.5 XMR | e2368bb7ef52
  | 0284d4857dcb
  | ddaba23b119b
  | 32fba36384f8
**Anonymityset Size**
As mentioned before, the size of an anonymityset for a CoinJoin transaction, regardless of whether it uses a decentralised platform like JoinMarket or a centralised, distributed platform like Dash's Darksend, is limited to the participants in that CoinJoin.
On the other hand, Monero's potential anonymityset is based on the number of outputs available for a particular denomination, and the actual anonymityset is on a per-input basis, and user selectable (I have created many transactions with a mixin of 100, for example).
More importantly: because outputs are "unlinkable" (ie. there's no way to cryptographically prove that two outputs were sent to the same person) you can grow the mixable set for a denomination by sending to yourself over and over, and there's no way an attacker can determine that.
This also means that Monero's anonymityset can only grow over time, whereas with CoinJoin a lack of participants (or a situation where a portion of the participants are poisoned) will most definitely lead to a trivial deanonymisation of transactions.

ZeroCash is amazing, cutting-edge research. In the far future I fully expect it will make Monero and Bitcoin obsolete.
However, it is somewhat unworkable right now. Firstly, it has a trusted accumulator problem that remains unsolved at this stage (although they posit solving this through an RSA UFO). Even if that is solved there is still the very real danger of it being impossible to see exploits in an absolutely opaque blockchain with relatively new and untested cryptography (ie. an exploit that lets an attacker create, say, 2 000 000 ZeroCash in a single day will go unnoticed). Finally, even with their newer ZKP schemes there is still a significant size impact for each transaction, and absolutely no way you'd be able to run SPV-style wallets or perform blockchain pruning.
Once the cryptography has been more thoroughly tested, corner cases have been solved, and technology is at a point where the size impact is negligible, then I would imagine some future iteration of ZeroCash will become the dominant form for cryptocurrency payments.

Sure, but most loyalty point systems don't allow you to transfer your loyalty points because they want *you* to keep coming back. Plus if a company wants to give out 1 or 10 or 1000 loyalty points who cares? We don't need to publicly verify that. A blockchain is a poor fit for loyalty points.

What about Yen or Dollar or Pound or Franc? Seriously, the term Dollar wasn't a conscious "brand" decision - it comes from "Joachimsthaler", named after a place where silver was mined, which lead to "thaler" and then "taler" in Germany in the 1500s. This was eventually anglicised into "Dollar".
Monero may sound strange to you, but it is immensely accessible to Spanish / Portuguese / Italian speakers due to its similarity to "dinero" / dinheiro / denaro, which means "money". Those three language groups alone cover 700 million people across the globe, and is the official language of 30 countries.
There are only 400 million native English speakers across the world, so any unfamiliarity on our part is unfortunate, but ultimately we're in the minority. But, hey, if English speakers can use avocado, banana, barbecue, California, canyon, chocolate, cocoa, coyote, cowboy, jerky, key, mosquito, potato, tomato, and tortilla...I guess we'll get used to using "Monero".

That is an outright lie. Elements Alpha implements Confidential Transactions, *which only hides the amount*. It specifically does not touch the transaction graph (what gmaxwell calls "transaction metadata") so that it doesn't affect Bitcoin's ability to prune.


Nonsense. That's like saying that Confidential Transactions is "just a design decision". Again - something like QoS, which takes an awful amount of work, is languishing in a Bitcoin Core pull request, when it is a job that could very well have been tackled by Elements Alpha.
Or the Bitcoin block size limit - where are the implementations fixing that in Elements Alpha?


If you're trying to create an artificially limited good that will be forced to increase in value due to scarcity, sure. If you're trying to create a "money" it's an excellent advantage, especially seeing as how the reduction of supply due to loss (death, lost wallets, etc.) will tend to converge on the inflation.


How is it vague? Typically coinbase transactions are in-band with the local wallet, Monero allows for out-of-band payments. It's not hard to understand.


Based on what? Your stating it as such doesn't really mean anything, especially seeing as how you can hardly understand some of the points.


Nope, it's not. You can create a non-deterministic wallet, not based on a single mnemonic-derived seed, and that STILL requires a single file to be backed up.

@_date: 2015-11-21 06:30:54
You're close:) What I've said before, and still say, is that Monero is (well, has the potential to be) an excellent store of value and a medium of exchange. What it *isn't* is an "investment".
The reasoning is that a store of value has two operational modes: either your store of value is "free" in that it's near-frictionless (eg. you can keep a bunch of diamonds in your home, and since you have to have security for your home anyway there's not much added cost), or you are paying a fee for the store of value.
Typically we're happy to pay a fee if, for example, we stick a bunch of gold bars in a bank vault. But then if we give the bank our cash we expect to earn interest on it. The thing with Monero is that the network isn't a bank. You are your own bank, and so just as a bank paying you interest has to work hard to make the money to cover that interest, so too you would need to work hard to make your own stash of Monero increase.
So, as a store of value and assuming the exchange rate stays exactly the same, any amount of Monero you hold would be subject to a slight decrease in value as new coins are mined, and a slight increase in value as new coins are lost. If these two forces lead to inflation of, say, 0.3% is that an acceptable "fee" to pay for the truly private store of value? I'd like to think so.

That's nonsensical, in cryptography it is always assumed to be broken and unsafe *until proven otherwise*. The way you design an anti-fragile system is by assuming actor maliciousness, not by assuming actor honesty.
A good read for understanding practical antifragility is: 
Also, this thread was spammed on a Bitcoin sub-reddit that has, as one of its rules: "Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere". Should we conclude that Darkcoin proponents are "classless" for doing this?
I did not shill for anything. Literally the top comment on the thread said "would be great to hear some other coders thoughts on the ideas in this interview" - how is it shilling when I respond to that? In my entire response I mention Monero only once, and that was as a disclaimer. If I hadn't done that I would've been accused of being devious by not disclosing my association with Monero. Instead I disclose it and now I'm accused of shilling. Do you see the hypocrisy in what you're expecting?
Your commentary sounds eerily familiar to what happened when Bitcoin core developer gmaxwell pointed out that Ripple's consensus model was unsound. [To quote him]( (and this reflects my own thoughts on the Darkcoin matter) -

Most cryptographic attacks seem counter-intuitive, and that's why the majority of us would make terrible cryptographers. We're not very good at thinking adverserially, because we aren't surrounded by people constantly trying to kill us.
Think of Bitcoin's blockchain like a Sudoku puzzle. It is true that this puzzle is ever-growing, but this growth is linear and progressive. Metadata, on the other hand, is almost never revealed linearly. A willing public disclosure of wallets associated with an exchange, for example, might fill in large portions of the puzzle as closures are computed for those addresses. Similarly, a hack of a service where the coins are all moved to a single address basically finalises a massive number of "threads" in the puzzle.
As with most cryptography problems, you have to assume that an attacker has near-unlimited resources, and more importantly basically unlimited time. The statute of limitations on an old transaction may be up, but if those outputs are spent in 10 year's time it can become relevant all over again. Also for some crimes the statute of limitations is exceedingly, exceedingly long - or even non-existent!

Ok I think that my statement may have been misinterpreted. First off: there's no "torrent of attacks", there was a request for a technical response to the ideas in the interview. I listened to the interview, and I focused my response accordingly. I chose not to delve into the danger of "sporks" (which is really just Bitcoin's alert-key mechanism twisted into a kill switch with no opt-out) nor the "we'll test it in production!" attitude it encourages. I focused only on what is architecturally and technically broken in Darkcoin.
Now to that quote of mine. First off, I said that we're not fighting for relevance because, quite frankly, I don't know if Monero will be around in 20 years time, and that's why I said that in that event both Monero and Darkcoin will just be bootnotes in long-forgotten journals. Cryptocurrency will have descended from Bitcoin, and any mention of the history of cryptocurrency will start with Bitcoin and then go on to the thing that replaced Bitcoin with no mention of the floundering sidebars that existed in its infancy.
I mean, when you read about the history of man landing on the moon you mostly read about the American space race, sometimes with some cold war Russian bits thrown in as background. Do you read about the UK space program? The Chinese? The Germans? Heck, even South Africa had a space program in the 60s that researched solid-fuel rockets till it was shut down under pressure from the US government.
Then fighting for marketcap and investors? We're not. In fact, I typically tell [those interested in purchasing Monero not to]( at least not without understanding that it's unlikely to make them "profit".
A lot of this attitude is because I've worked on and contributed to open-source projects before, and you can be that "marketcap" and "investors" are not terms bandied about. Yes, the fact that this open source project is "money" changes things, but not so substantially that I lose all moral compass and work ethic. The Monero core team chose to divorce ourselves from investors and "the market" and price a long time ago, specifically when we rejected pressure from "investors" that wanted us to flatten the emission curve (under the guise of us not having chosen it in the first place) - even though such a change would have led to an increase in price due to increase scarcity in the short-term. We refused (and still refuse) to modify our social contract. Our emission curve was set in stone the day we launched, and it *does not change*.
Of course we want "the market", but that's not "the marketcap", it's "the userbase", for two reasons:
1. It is its own special type of reward when you create something useful, like our [OpenAlias]( project that any cryptocurrency can use and that has a plugin in Electrum 2.0, and people start using it. To see people eschew long and complicated Bitcoin and Monero and Whatever-coin addresses in favour of donate or epicenterbitcoin.com and so on...that is a reward in and of itself.
2. The bigger the userbase the more we'll get [donations and sponsors]( and the more the [many contributors to the project]( can spend more time on it.
I know that it's hard to believe that we actually care that much about the technology we're building, but if you've been involved in open-source projects before our attitude will seem completely natural and not at all surprising.

[3457]( to [4032]( drop to a 277 DRK reward, only to have blocks [4033]( to [4501]( have a 500 DRK reward. As you correctly point out it then goes to 56 DRK from block 4502 (although bizarrely decreases to 21 DRK up till block 5466, when it increases to 122 DRK).

Uh...you mean *this* official GUI wallet?  It's ready to be wired up as we build out the library interfaces for Monero, which is one of the things we've been working towards and on for the last year.
Honestly, the GUI wallet is such a small component of what we're doing. Instead of mucking about with stuff that is "flashy" we're instead focused on actual privacy enhancements, like Ring CT, a cryptographic method for completely hiding transaction amounts, based on the ground-breaking CT research that gmaxwell et. al. initially designed: 


We know exactly how to prune it. We've known for 18 months, you just never asked *if* we could prune it, you always assumed we couldn't. With Bitcoin you prune by retaining the utxoset and discarding the block history, and with Monero you prune by retaining the txoset and keyimageset and discarding the block history.
Incidentally, what do you think would happen if there were thousands of Dash users all actively using DarkSend? I'll tell you what would happen: massive blockchain growth that is comparable, if not greater, than Monero's. In fact, Monero's transactions are physically smaller than Bitcoin's (and, by extension, Dash's) on a like-for-like basis, due to the significantly smaller signatures and the lighter scripting language.

So do I! Plenty of them, in fact, from Galera cluster to LMDB to Postgres. Amazing!


Blockchains are supposed to be inefficient, that's the cost of using a secure blockchain. But that inefficiency gives you:
- censorship resistance
- immutability
- permanence
- global consensus
- global timestamping
- security
So I guess each serves its own purpose, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:15:08


There's the rub, as they say. We didn't choose anything:) Monero was launched by a person called thankful_for_today as Bitmonero. After a couple of weeks he wanted to make Bitmonero merge-mined with Bytecoin, which the community rejected (there was even a blockchain vote on the subject). He decided to ignore the community and make it merge-mined anyway, to which the community gave him the middle finger and forked the project. The 6 people, beyond myself, that spearheaded that effort became the Monero Core Team.
In other words: we didn't choose the initial distribution. Our influence on the emission curve, though, was adding the 0.3 XMR minimum block reward to retain mining incentives (ie. your assumption sas to the justification is correct). This makes Monero slightly inflationary (technically it's disinflationary as this inflation amount falls, when reflected as a percentage). The *initial* "fast inflation" exists, but is comparable to Bitcoin's emission curve in its speed, albeit slightly faster.

**Note:** there may be an obvious answer to this, in that old transactions were paid straight to the pubkey and not to the address. Just double-checking that to make sure:)
**Note2:** confirmed by - the pubkey is in the raw transaction. My post below can be disregarded, the sticked post stands as correct. My post remains for reference.
Cross-posting my post on one of the other threads, just to add to the confusion:


This was my first thought, but in his blog post he provides an ECDSA public key:
This public key corresponds to the Bitcoin address ```12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S``` - but the process of going from the public key to the Bitcoin address requires you to first SHA256 hash the public key, and then RIPEMD-160 hash that result.
Now consider: it is EXTREMELY unlikely that a pre-signed message would've included the public key. It is also equally unlikely that Wright was able to brute-force through both hashing functions.
Thus we are left with only two options:
1. Wright managed to get a pre-signed message *and* the address pubkey from the real Satoshi at some point in the past
2. Wright is actually Satoshi
I'm not sure it makes a difference to me personally either way.

We thought about making Monero a Bitcoin sidechain, but there are several reasons not to:
1. We didn't want our security model to rely on Bitcoin's, that way it's a hedge against any failure models with regards to that.
2. We didn't want to compromise our transactional privacy by having it peg back to Bitcoin (thus removing the entire point of transactional privacy every time this happens)
3. We don't believe that Monero is only about transactional privacy. It is merely a foundation upon which much can be built, such as decentralised, private identity and trust relationships, or private store-and-forward messaging. This is incompatible with making it a Bitcoin sidechain.
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:35:55
We're talking about merge-mining, though, not about sidechains in general.
Imagine, if you will, a Monero-like sidechain that adds fantastic privacy improvements for Bitcoin, but has so few miners it is trivially attacked. What's the point?

The GUI wallet was never the number one on our priority list, and it was moved to a much lower priority after the block 202612 attack. There are also several GUI and lightweight options on our [Choose a Client]( page, so focusing effort on a core GUI would be misplaced at this time.
What is "top of our priority list" are the items on our [Design and Development Goals]( listed under "Currently in Development" and "Currently Being Researched". You'll notice the GUI is on our development goals, but it's down towards the bottom (the list is in order of priority).
Finally, if you want to see what you personally view as a priority moved to the top, well this is an unfunded open-source project. You are not a shareholder, you don't pay our salaries. In fact, I don't see you anywhere on the [Community Hall of Fame]( not even on the "Donators of 1 XMR" list.

I have. Go ask Ryno for his opinion on that.


I doubt it, if you're misusing common terms like "zero-knowledge" that have a specific cryptographic meaning. Also the fact that you feel the need to qualify yourself as a "cryptographer" speaks volumes, especially when you link to nothing on arXiv you've published.
Oh, and there's this: 
Great understanding of what a private key is. I'm sure you're a cryptographer of note.


Monero is based on the same principles (ring signatures and dual-key stealth addresses), as acknowledged in the whitepaper. There is no marked difference from a cryptography perspective. I'm also fairly confident that Ryno has read things we've published like [MRL-0004]( and SDC will eventually be patched to prevent temporal association attacks and so on.
You could make other arguments for XMR vs. SDC, but cryptography wouldn't be one of them.

I'm maybe misunderstanding - from what I understood he was suggesting having Monero as a hedge *against* Bitcoin in case Bitcoin becomes undesirable due to the lack of privacy, not for Monero's protocol to be integrated into Bitcoin (which is pretty much unworkable, as you correctly guessed).

I'm not sure I understand your point. All that an attacker can observe (even a sophisticated attacker with direct access to the exchange) is that you bought some Bitcoin, then you bought some Monero, and then it disappeared into a black hole.
@_date: 2015-10-01 13:20:19
Nowhere near enough.
1. Your IP is still exposed as the node that first broadcast the transaction
2. Tracing transactions through the blockchain is still trivially done
3. You don't need to categorically know the amount being transferred when you can infer it from metadata (either blockchain metadata or external metadata)
I love the elegance of CT, but let's not overstate what it accomplishes from a privacy perspective. It ONLY covers a small subset of privacy cases, such as targeted crime (if a criminal knows you own / carry a large amount of Bitcoin) or the accidental leaking of salaries / profit margins. The major advantage it offers is that it solves these cases without compromising Bitcoin's "prunability".
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:00:15


No worse than any protocol-level privacy measure added to Bitcoin and its clones, as long as those privacy measures are used actively and continuously. So if JoinMarket had to be made mandatory for every transaction, for example, there would be a similarly large size impact. Clearly, then, for any cryptocurrency privacy measure there *will* be a transaction size trade-off.
The primary disadvantage to Monero's scheme is that it provides significantly greater privacy, but it makes pruning significantly more expensive. With Bitcoin you (should) have a utxoset that doesn't grow too rapidly, and when you prune you can drop all historical information except the utxoset. With Monero you have a growing mixable txoset, as well as an ever-growing key image set. You *can* prune the blocks and keep the txoset and key image set, and this would provide significant space saving, but still ultimately a linear reduction in required space for non-archival nodes.
On the other hand, one must consider whether a blockchain of 30gb is "better" than a blockchain of 150gb. In my mind the size is equally painful if you have a small drive, and equally unimportant if you have a lot of drive space.
@_date: 2015-03-21 09:33:03
I understand completely where you're coming from. The problem is that it doesn't have to happen with regularity or even very often.

How would the whole concept be disproven by Bitcoin failing?
What if, for example, Satoshi comes back and declares himself overlord of the earth because he's now worth a cool $400 million, and then starts dumping because he has to buy tanks and guns to defend his fortress...that could cause Bitcoin to fail, but it wouldn't mean that cryptocurrency as an idea is fundamentally broken.

I have no idea. But I think it's naive to be unable to imagine scenarios where Bitcoin's lack of privacy becomes a hindrance. All it takes is the right access to signals to rule a large portion of transactions out as unrelated to a target, leaving a fraction remaining that are related.
And even if we rule out outright illegalities, things like earnings analysis, knowing where you buy your flowers for your mistress, or what sick fetishes you're buying access to are all things that can be leveraged.

@_date: 2015-02-24 10:03:29
That's not the way it works with Monero (although I fully agree with you when it comes to smart assets etc.)
Bitcoin adding Monero's dual-key stealth addresses, for instance, will face heavy political push-back...but let's assume that it overcomes that. Adding ring signatures, however, would be practically impossible for several reasons:
- it would break every single SPV wallet and lightweight client system, as outputs could never be known if they are spent or unspent
- because of the distribution of non-stealth unspent transaction outputs in Bitcoin it would offer virtually no improvement in privacy until it had many, many, MANY years (eg. if an output from one of the very early Bitcoin blocks mined by Satoshi is included in a ring signature it can trivially be discarded as the most likely invalid signature in the group)

Humans are a poor source of entropy, we think we're being random when we're not. What you're suggesting is the equivalent of a brain wallet, and here's how that turns out: 
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:40:35
1. Monero provides transactional untraceability (for incoming transactions there are many equiprobable senders).
2. Monero provides transactional unlinkability (for outgoing transactions you cannot prove they were sent to the same person).
3. Monero uses Ed25519 / Curve25519 / EdDSA instead of secp256k1 / ECDSA.
4. Monero has infinite emission, so mining rewards are retained ad infinitum.
5. Monero has a dynamic block size limit that grows or falls with use.
6. Monero has a disconnected daemon / clients architecture.
7. Monero supports out-of-band block reward payments.
8. Monero has an accessible PoW (one that lowers the performance gap between CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs).
9. Monero has node bandwidth control (QoS) built in.
10. Monero wallets are mnemonic seed based by default.
11. Monero only requires you to backup your wallet file once, at creation, and you never have to back it up ever again. Ever.

Naughty boy, quoting out of context. Here is the full quote: 


That's like me claiming that my bathroom is secure because nobody has ever broken into it. The reality is that nobody who knows what they're doing is even going to try given how (relatively) worthless Dash is at the moment. That's not an insult, it's a pragmatic reality.


Who? Are we talking about a proper, institutional code review? Or just some random that got paid to glance through the code? And that happened what, like a year ago? Security is a process, not a once-off event.


"Double spend proof" requires cryptographic proof of the claim, you have none.
"Decentralised governance by blockchain" is a joke - it's based on Masternode voting, and one person (Otoh) owns how many MasterNodes...60% of them or something? Additionally, the barrier to entry (to participate in voting) is extremely high. On the one hand this reduces the risk of Sybil attacks, but on the other hand it means that your "decentralised governance" is merely governance by a very small cabal of Masternode owners. What should the community do if they feel strongly about a matter? Lobby those few with large clusters of Masternodes? It's no better than any centralised form of governance, and is worse because it has the pretence of decentralisation.
"Scalability (in testing)" is just that...in testing, with little bearing on how it would function in a real transaction-pressure environment.

You absolutely can track every single satoshi.
As I'm sure you are aware, you don't need to be the NSA to be capable of big data analysis. Law enforcement have access to screeds of data, obtained through means too numerous to mention, and will absolutely be able to rule out, with a balance of probabilities, where a transaction went to or is coming from. You've even seen "ordinary" people analyse the blockchain when thefts have occurred, tracing coins all the way to a deposit at a specific exchange.
But don't listen to me, why don't you read [the view of a well-known Bitcoin academic and cryptography researcher (Andrew Poelstra)]( or at least [glance at this article about a whitepaper detailing one deanonymising method]( (and note the Bitcoin core dev agreeing that the attack is feasible and that it is already known).

They're 100% right in the sense that it is still a very unpolished project, and there are lots of things we need to do before we can release an "official" GUI (see the development section of our [design and development goals]( for more detail on what leads up to the official GUI). That having been said, the ["Choose A Client"]( page on the Monero website should give you various options, from the dead easy to use [MyMonero]( web client, to two open-source third-party GUIs that are in active development. Those may be stop-gap solutions to the release of the official GUI, but they're stop-gap solutions filling a need whilst we get Monero's foundation truly solid.
Blockchain bloat is a different matter entirely (although any mixing process, Darkcoin's included, will "bloat" the blockchain as a natural cost for adding obfuscation). At this stage any reduction in the Monero blockchain that we can introduce will be linear in nature (e.g. allowing nodes to discard old group signatures as a form of pruning). There is active ongoing research by the [Monero Research Lab]( into SPV-style wallets (passing bloom filters instead of viewkeys) that don't reduce privacy, more efficient signature schemes that can introduce a linear decrease in blockchain size that will make a difference in the long term, and blockchain pruning that keeps just the utxoset / key image set.

Every Bitcoin clone destroys inputs and creates new utxos. That's how transactions work.
Also transactions by definition require a difference between input and output total, that's how you pay fees. No Bitcoin or Bitcoin-clone has forced the number of inputs/outputs be the same or that the amount be equal.
Your last comment is laughable. Bitcoin relies on zero-knowledge proofs for its operation, so every cryptocurrency has ZK. Nonetheless, ZeroCash offers an absolutely opaque blockchain, compared to Monero/Shadow's "mostly opaque" blockchain.
Don't overstate the importance of the cryptocurrency you're shilling for.

Well we can't take all the credit, a large portion of the clever cryptography was initially invented by CryptoNote, we just improved on it and made it our own:)
There are a couple of exchanges that trade Monero, [Poloniex]( is usually the most liquid, but there's also [Bittrex]( [Melotic]( and [CoinSwap]( If you'd like to avoid storing your Monero on an exchange then there is the [MyMonero]( web-based account management system, which is (reasonably) secure in that it never knows your spend key and thus can't spend your funds on your behalf.
XMR is currently trading around 0.00121 BTC to the XMR, so 1 BTC would buy you ~826 XMR.

You're incorrect, the cryptographic proof is in the blog post, and there's not that much in the way of "lingo" and "blah blah". It's a well written post that goes through the steps of independently verifying the various parts of generating and signing messages from an ECDSA key pair.
**Edit:** forgot that old transactions were paid to pubkey, not the hash, which means the one piece of proof I quickly verified was actually trivially obtainable. Nonetheless, the post is still a nice overview of the ECDSA signing process.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:53:11
**Note:** as confirmed by - the pubkey is in the raw transaction. My post below can be disregarded, the sticked post stands as correct. My post remains for reference.


This was my first thought, but in his blog post he provides an ECDSA public key:
This public key corresponds to the Bitcoin address ```12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S``` - but the process of going from the public key to the Bitcoin address requires you to first SHA256 hash the public key, and then RIPEMD-160 hash that result.
Now consider: it is EXTREMELY unlikely that a pre-signed message would've included the public key. It is also equally unlikely that Wright was able to brute-force through both hashing functions.
Thus we are left with only two options:
1. Wright managed to get a pre-signed message *and* the address pubkey from the real Satoshi at some point in the past
2. Wright is actually Satoshi
I'm not sure it makes a difference to me personally either way.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:40:08
Yep - now the one thing to bear in mind is that, because Bitcoin doesn't have stealth addresses like Monero does, you will be revealing an address you own publicly. So, if you setup an alias, treat it the same way you would sticking your Bitcoin address up on a forum or whatever.
Edit: forgot to add that the Electrum plugin supports both FQDN-style aliases (eg. donate.getmonero.org) and email style aliases (eg. ric Both of those examples have working Bitcoin addresses on them if you want to test alias resolution, although make sure you cancel the send before completing it:)

What on earth are you talking about. This has nothing to do with delays from spam.
Exchanges require a certain number of confirmations before you can place the deposited funds on the order book. They do this for security, to prevent issues resulting from double spend attempts and so on. By using Liquid they can allow traders to move funds between exchanges without needing to touch Bitcoin mainchain, but also without needing to have complex business relationships and funds held in trusts etc.
It literally has nothing to do with block size, at all, on any level. The requirement for Liquid would still exist even if the block size limit was 2gb.

@_date: 2015-02-01 17:04:11
No, I don't think you understand what "anonymous" means in this context.
Imagine you buy a very illegal Green Box from a supplier of illegal Green Boxes. Said supplier is subsequently caught by the po-po, who gain access to their wallet. They can see a payment made by you (although they don't know who it's from yet). By analysing the payment and following where the change went to they eventually follow the chain (forward or backwards) to an address controlled by and exchange. They subpoena the exchange, who provides them with your IP address or other information, and so it goes.
The break in the flow isn't to never use an exchange, the break is that *transactions should be private*. In Bitcoin they are not.
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:27:57
No. Firstly, the complexities of doing this are unfathomably complex. Based on our current understanding and research, we do not believe that Monero can support SPV proofs due to the nature of utxos in Monero, which are never visibly/knowingly "spent". That means that a Monero sidechain would have to use an asymmetric two-way peg (see 3.3 on the sidechains whitepaper), and as the whitepaper even admits: "We do not explore this possibility in detail here, as issues
surrounding reorganisations result in a significant expansion in complexity."
Secondly, even if it was possible with an asymmetric two-way peg, it's very likely that the peg back to Bitcoin would require the outputs to be visibly spent (the equivalent of a mixin 0 transaction, which we no longer allow in Monero, see the [Monero Research Lab MRL-0004]( bulletin for details as to why). This visible spending retroactively invalidates much of the privacy on any transactions where the now-spent output was one of the ring signatures.
So a Monero sidechain would be prohibitively complex to create, and would most probably provide vastly reduced privacy compared to Monero itself.

You're assuming the goal is to steal your holdings, that's not necessarily the case, especially if its a nation state looking to make an example out of someone.
Also, as somebody who actively works to develop privacy-enhancing technologies, good opsec should not be a requirement. It should be a part of catching edge-cases that software can't prevent, but unless the system is architected to protect the privacy of its end-users it will likely compromise good opsec rather than the other way around.

That's incorrect - it's 2.5gb. For the same usage as Bitcoin the blockchain should be 3-5 times larger. If you can afford to run a Bitcoin full node with its 60gb blockchain you can afford to run a Monero full node at 300gb in 5 years time. If you can't afford 300gb of disk space with the technology available in 5 years time then you shouldn't run a full node.

You're almost there, but relying on wallets being online to mix would be crazy, and very open to Sybil attacks (ie. it's cheap for an attacker to setup 100 000 wallets and then own the bulk of the ring signatures). So the way it works is more elegant.
Take a transaction where I'm sending you 123.456 XMR (Monero). That is broken into orders of magnitude, so the outputs created by the transaction are 100, 20, 3, 0.4, 0.05, and 0.006 XMR (plus whatever outputs are necessary for the change to come back to you). Those outputs then get put into a table of outputs available for mixing.
Now fast forward a few hours, a few days, a few years, and Alice is sending Bob a transaction 50 XMR. In doing so she uses a 100 XMR input (that she owns), so obviously she's going to have an output of 50 XMR (for Bob) and another set of change outputs that for the remaining 50 XMR less the transaction fee. Here's where it gets clever: that 100 XMR input doesn't just have her signature proving she owns and can spend this input, but it has her signature, and my signature from that 100 XMR output on that old transaction, and a bunch of other signatures. By analysing the blockchain there's simply no way to tell if that 100 XMR input is from Alice or even from me.
We tend to talk about the utxoset (unspent transaction output set) when talking about Bitcoin, and that terminology has fallen over to Monero, but the terminology doesn't really fit...because transaction outputs are never really "spent", at least not in a visible manner. There are some caveats to this, but if you want to read about one such attack then the Monero Research Lab's [first research bulletin, MRL-0001]( is an excellent starting point.

You're cherry-picking a single point, and ignoring the rest, but no matter.
Your silly reply aside, as I understand it otoh has at least 500 MasterNodes, at least those are the ones that are publicly known to be his. Even if Dash magically somehow managed to get 5000 MasterNodes, that's still 10% of the voting power in the hands of a single person. That's a swing vote, a veto vote, a tremendous amount of power in a "governance system".
Meanwhile an ordinary user with 800 Dash can vote on exactly nothing.

Just to speak to two of your points:
*Point 2:* Proof of work prevents this. Think about it: how many "true" nodes, of the 8 default maximum, do you need to be connected in order for your node to find the real network? If you answered 5 you would be incorrect - the real answer is 1. You only need to find 1 node serving the chain with the greatest cumulative proof of work in order to be synchronised with the "real" network. Thus, Sybil attacks are impossible.
Even in the well-researched case of a full-on isolation attack (where your node is connected to only bad nodes, and remains that way) what can those nodes do? They can serve a fake blockchain to you, and they can refuse to route your transactions, but they can't steal your money. Thus Bitcoin operates in an adversarial environment, and it does so in a trustless way.
For the stated purpose of providing privacy, Masternodes *have to be trusted* to not publish and/or leak the details of every mix they're involved in, and they have to be trusted in perpetuity (since the mix is on the blockchain forever).
*Point 3:* By and large, most of the people in the cryptocurrency space have never been exposed to open-source development, and have no idea how open-source governance works. A good essay on different types of open-source governance models is "[The Cathedral and The Bazaar]( if you're interested. At any rate, for the longest time open-source projects have thrived because institutions like MIT and the OTF and DARPA have funded open-source development, and also because some contributors ended up working for companies that used the software and paid them to continue contributing. This model works because, even when institutions and companies have ulterior motives and want to influence the project direction, they are kept in check by other contributors.
Now we can definitely have a discussion about whether or not Bitcoin's development is inclusionary and welcoming enough to attract contributors to perform these checks and balances, but that does not mean that the model does not work. Internal funding can also work, but n the FOSS world projects like that are never community driven, and are invariably more corporate / BDFL in structure. So in the case of Mozilla, for example, it works because they are a registered non-profit with a board of directors, a CEO, and so on. Dash may appear to be "community driven" right now, but given that Masternodes do all the voting it is unlikely to ever really represent the desires of the community.

Ok let me speak to your second point first: syncing up *is* slower than Bitcoin and Bitcoin-forks because Monero achieves much stricter consensus by receiving every block from all of its peers (typically 12 minimum) during normal operation, including during catch up. We'll move to a headers-first style system in future, but it doesn't have massive priority given that many people are using [MyMonero]( or remote nodes, and our approach to strict consensus saved us during a [highly sophisticated attempt to fork the network]( in early September last year.
Now as to how Monero solves the block size problem: blocks in Monero don't have a fixed size or a fixed limit. Instead, a block size median is calculated over the last 100 blocks. If the median is under 20 000 bytes then the effective median is set at 20 000 bytes, else it is just the median over the past 100 blocks. The block size limit is then set at 130% of that median.
Thus naturally, over time, the block size will grow to accommodate demand. In fact, if the block median is at 20kb, and there is a massive influx of transactions, the block median can grow to 1mb within 587 blocks (just under 10 hours), so the ramp up (or down) is not at all restricted if there is sufficient demand.

BTW, from the Federal Reserve page: "There was approximately $1.2 trillion in circulation as of August 14, 2013, of which $1.16 trillion was in Federal Reserve notes." So if Bitcoin becomes as prolific as cash, it will be a lot smaller than my previous figures.

You're right, I stated it rather matter-of-factly, and of course there remains the chance (however slim or great) that it will tank. My proviso, though, was "give it time" wherein I was non-specific about the amount of time, but your point is taken.
@_date: 2013-07-08 16:00:17
Perhaps - but it is VERY high risk for the bank. The overdraft limit is the amount of money they believe they could reclaim from the individual in court if the person defaults; going over that limit means that it is outside of the risk profile, and chances are the person will NOT pay the fees or pay up the overdraft one day.

1.6e+21 *is* a horribly huge number of combinations. Here's a cut-and-paste of a recent comment of mine to give you some insight:
"Well, let's say we took [Word Frequency's top 5 000 English word list]( which is free. Logic dictates we should add punctuation, state/city/zip code info, common first and last names, and so on. But let's say we're feeling somewhat illogical and we just want the 5 000 words. It's not a lot of words, you know, and we could definitely get correcthorsebatterystaple out of it. To do so we *only* need to go 4 words deep. So 5 000 words combined all around is a mere 625 000 000 000 000 combinations.
"But modern password tools and modern processors yada yada!" you exclaim. Well, based on [current JtR benchmarks]( if we had a server with 16x Intel Xeon X7550 processors (with 8 physical cores in each processor) and we were breaking some simple MD5 crypt() hashes, we could do an incredible 1 953 000c/s. So we could get through those computations (and find correcthorsebatterystaple) in only 320 020 481 seconds, or about 10.14 years."
With 200 000 words it would take considerably longer. GPUs do little to improve this, except to lower the total cost attached to breaking a password.
I'd also like to point out that OP's password was "John Brown, John Brown; apple mattress angst Yeti" which, if you take punctuation and whitespace into account, really consists of 17 individual parts. Again, using a mere 5 000 words (assuming we managed to jam some punctuation/spaces in there) we'd need to test 7.62e+62 combinations. Using the aforementioned benchmark, that's 3.906e+56 seconds, or 1.238e+49 years.

The Blockchain app has been there for ages, and Apple haven't pulled it.
To be honest, you should be far, far more afraid of storing and using your Bitcoin on an Android device. Any minute now you'll install a price ticker or a flashlight app or some other benign-looking app that will rip your wallet and keylog your password.
This is an instance where Apple's lockout of intra-app file access is hugely beneficial, and their insistence on passcode locks (or TouchID) just adds a nice layer to physical device security (inasmuch as TouchID can be broken and your passcode can be guessed).

That is utter rubbish - that's precisely what freelancer.com and guru.com and similar sites are for. You prepay a portion of the work before the freelancer starts, and you keep paying as they reach milestones. I've used freelancer.com for maybe 150 pieces of work, and have had very few problems - far less problems than even hiring full-time staff. For a project of this term I'd simply set a bi-monthly milestone, and then suspend payment if the freelancer pulls a runner.
Although, to be honest, with the level of cash-on-hand we're talking about, it is trivial to hire *local*, full-time staff on contract. In my previous pricing example I was talking about hiring people full-time. I don't mean to turn this into an ad hominem attack, but you clearly don't have any idea how easy it is to execute as a software startup if you have $600k in your coffers. Are you in software development at all? Have you ever been involved in large-scale software projects from a managerial perspective?

I don't think you've thought this all the way through. The attack you suggest is **no different** to an attacker cloning your credit card. There are many instances where a credit card company won't pay back stolen funds - so if you're stupid enough to lose your paper wallet you may as well kiss the funds goodbye. There isn't much you can do to mitigate a physical attack of a paper wallet (the possible exception being if the private key was encoded with a passphrase).
However, your last point is more than a little ludicrous. For years there have been services that notify you when a transaction is made on an address. You can sign up for a free wallet on blockchain.info, for example, and then add the paper wallet address as "watch only" (no private key needed). Then you turn on notifications, and voila, you'll know the minute the attacker spends the funds.

As far as anyone can tell, there are 30 000+ BFL backorders. They *claim* that they'll catch up on pre-orders in two months after they actually ship, but with that quantity I think you can expect an order placed today to actually ship in September-ish (if you're lucky). By that time you can also expect the difficulty to have gone up 50-100 fold.
**Best case scenario (difficulty up by 50) -** you will mine about 1.965 BTC a month, which at today's exchange rate is just under $200. To hedge a bet on the exchange rate having climbed up substantially enough for you to be making enough to recover your $2500 quickly is a dangerous bet indeed.
**Worst case scenario (difficulty up by 100) -** you will be mining half of that - about 0.984 BTC a month. This is a more likely scenario:)

Do you even understand what DDoS stands for? Distributed denial of service.
Let's use an analogy. Let's imagine you're a bank, and you store peoples funds in cash in a vault. In order for people to get their funds they have to open the vault using their code. A *denial of service* attack would be like someone putting a rather large hosepipe with water constantly gushing out right above the entrance of the vault, so nobody can get inside to get their money. A *distributed denial of service* is the same thing, just with a whole lot of small hosepipes rather than one big one.
Can you see how in both of those circumstances the vault remains locked and inaccessible to both the bank and the people who need funds from it? At no point does an attacker gain access to the vault, no matter how much water pours out the hosepipes. It prevents *access* to the vault, but does not compromise the security or integrity of the vault.
In fact, during a DoS or DDoS attack, the attacker themselves cannot (generally speaking) gain access to the servers hosting the application, so there is simply no way a DDoS attack would lead to compromised emails or stolen Bitcoin (except if there was a separate compromise that took place despite the DDoS attack, not because of it).

Not true. If they suspect you are a high risk, they give you two options: either they can use the funds in the account to refund customers, or else they put a hold on the funds for 180 days (maximum chargeback window on credit cards) after which you get your funds. They don't steal money, they don't keep your funds indefinitely (their auditors would throw a fit).
Additionally, high risk customers are easy to spot. They're selling pseudonymously, they don't want to provide any documentation, they're running unchecked and unfettered most likely without declaring their earnings (or part of them at least). PayPal is under no obligation to deal with dodgy. Heck, we regularly block people from completing a direct credit card purchase based on a number of factors that indicate it is most probably a fraudulent purchase. Risk mitigation is part of doing business.
If PayPal ever flag us as high risk, you can bet we have appropriate documentation to show our business model, our up-to-date tax filings, and our business registration; thus satiating PayPal's risk mitigation department.

Have you even [read my comment]( on the thread where I tested it with a far more powerful flashlight?
USE THE STICKERS THAT CANTON SELLS, otherwise OBVIOUSLY the private key is easy to see. Also, the extra printing obscures the QR code, so it can't be scanned. If you don't stick the holographic stickers on then you're opening yourself up to a world of hurt.
***NB:*** here is some none-FUD to consider - just because you have stickers on doesn't mean they can't be removed and discretely replaced. Read David Perry's [article on the Casascius hack]( to see a little bit of info as to how they performed a similar attack against the stickers on the coins. A paper wallet *is* secure if you take basic precautions and keep it on you or store it in a safe somewhere. If your wallet is stolen or lost, even temporarily, consider your physical Bitcoins and your paper wallet compromised, and move to a new one.

Oh wait. It won't.
BIP38 with a sufficiently long passphrase is considerably secure; avoiding exposing the (encrypted) private key is nothing more than a security-through-obscurity layer (not security-BY-obscurity, which is a different principle). You don't make your private key publicly accessible because you want to reduce your attack surface, but there is nothing wrong with storing it on a cloud-based email or file storage system - even if it's compromised there's an entire encryption layer they'll need to break.

Remember, too, that when 2040-ish rolls round and the block reward finally ends many miners will go offline, as it won't be remotely profitable to run any sort of mining farm. Difficulty will plummet, and eventually the network will go back to some sort of happy medium where people run n^th generation ASICs for fun and not to make money. Thus the total electricity consumption of the network will massively decrease to far, far less than it is today.

Sure, but they're thinking like technical people and yet trying to launch a product to target non-technical people. Here are 3 results off the first page of Google when searching for darknet:
[Meet Darknet, the hidden, anonymous underbelly of the searchable Web](  
(a choice quote: "Once you’re on a directory, one thing becomes overwhelmingly obvious: A lot of dirty, downright illegal stuff happens in Onionland. You’ll quickly find links to credit-card scammers, forged documents and currency, weapons dealers, gambling sites, marketplaces for every vice imaginable, hacker havens, the types of illegal and disgusting porn that get chased off the Surface Web, and even the notorious Silk Road trading post.")
[The Attack on the Dark Net Took Down a Lot More Than Child Porn](  
(a choice quote: "The widespread blackout appears to be the result of an FBI sting, targeted at the trade of kiddie porn on the Tor Network.")
[Users of 'darknet' websites advised to dump Windows](  
(a choice quote: "So-called 'darknet' services like Tor have a bad name, because they are used to spread pornography and images of child abuse, as well as to sell drugs via sites such as the Silk Road.")
That's what the average person knows about Tor. Whilst some of those articles may espouse the positive side of anonymity, the man-in-the-street would be hard-pressed to find a name with such negative connotations positive. Think about successful Internet services that common-folk have used or do use on an ongoing basis; they have names like Yahoo! or Flickr or Facebook. If Facebook was called DarkSocial I don't think if would have quite the same appeal, despite Facebook's major privacy flaws.

This is confusing, and is definitely a result of a poorly configured nginx box. I don't need to touch fix_pathinfo because my nginx config is explicit. ie. -
    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param  PATH_INFO        $fastcgi_path_info;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_pass phpfpm;
    }
So images will never be passed to phpfpm, as only files that explicitly have a .php extension and exist on disk will be passed to phpfpm.
I tried recreating that forum exploit, and I can't defeat my config. I'm not saying that nginx wasn't configured that way in this instance, but fix_pathinfo is not the solution to that problem - configuring nginx properly is the solution.

No, your example doesn't fit with mine. The "crime" they are committed of is not just lying on a form, presumably to avoid having to comply with legislation, but then perpetuating that lie for *years*.
So a happy medium between my extreme example and your nonsensical one is this: a driver gets his license by lying about a disability, perhaps extremely poor eyesight and refusal to wear glasses. Is it a difficult thing for him to get glasses? Not really. Is it a costly thing? Perhaps, but he can get financial assistance if need be. Instead, he *chooses* not to get glasses, and he *chooses* to lie about it in order to get his license. Now if the police get wind of his unlicensed driving after he's been driving for *several years*, what should they do? A simple phone call? A slap on the wrist? Come on, man, there has to be action taken for something that is more than a simple breach!
"It is ironic that in a democracy where all are free and enjoy equal rights, we must also have laws - equal responsibilities - so that the rights and freedom of others are protected. However, in a democracy, laws must also be fair, clearly defined, and *applied equally to all members of the society* - both citizens and rulers." - Robert Alan Silverstein

That's 1.31072e+90 to test. Even at 348 billion hashes per second (point of note: GPU rigs don't do AES decryption anywhere close to that speed; you're talking solely about the SHA-1 cycle of the decryption, but hey) it would take 3.7664e+78 seconds to run through, or about 1.19432e+71 years.

Miners get paid the transaction fees for the block, as well as a "block reward" (which is effectively creating brand new currency, or "printing money" as you said).

Again...THERE IS NO BACKDOOR.

I agree - I almost think they should have a two-step process like the pools have. A username/password to login and manage their addresses (create new ones, import WIFs etc.), and then a passphrase for their private key. No BTC can be sent without the passphrase, and the ability to view ones balance is largely irrelevant if you can't do anything with it.

Your phone, while technically running a Darwin/BSD or Linux kernel (iOS and Android respectively) is not meant to be a computer. They are two different devices.
Let me use an analogy I've used before. Your phone is like a drill. It can be used to drill holes in various types of material, and even to file things with the right attachments. An iPhone is like a nice Makita drill. It comes with several drill bits, costs a lot more than a cheap-o Black and Decker, but will outlast it by an order of magnitude. When the Makita drill owner wants a new or different drill bit, he's only allowed to go to one hardware store - but hey, it's the biggest hardware store in the world, and it has [over a million drill bits]( covering everything the handyman could want to do with a drill.
On the other hand, Android is like a Bosch drill. It's no Makita, as any craftsman will attest, but it's a decent drill. The owner can do whatever he wants with the drill - strip it apart and use it to power his go-cart, connect a propeller to it and use it as a fan, whatever he wants. He can buy drill bits from anywhere - and because he's thrifty he doesn't go into the big, expensive hardware store, he can just buy drill bits from the homeless guy on the corner. Of course, when these dodgy drill bits occasionally get hot and explode, it's not the drill manufacturer's fault. And the poor drill owner gets pieces of advice ranging from "you should just use the CyanogenMod drill shield - there's no excuse not to!" to "you wouldn't have had this problem if you'd read the fine print on the back of the drill bit packaging" to "you really should be upgrading your drill motor on a regular basis".
Now a laptop is more like a car. It comes in many more flavours than drills, and is far, far more customisable. It also serves far more purposes than a drill. It can transport people, transport goods, tow various types of trailers, yank gates off hinges, and all sorts. Your car can also be a death trap - far more dangerous than a drill - but most people have a greater amount of respect for that danger. They take precautions, such as putting on their seatbelt, which is kinda like installing antivirus.
A car is "easy to drive", in a sense. But it takes practice and skill to drive it safely and effectively. It takes even more skill to reach racing driver level. But a racing driver in a Kia Picanto and a learner driver in a Kia Picanto are both just people in Kia Picantos. The only difference is in what they choose to do with it.
Now on my Macbook I've explicitly allowed unsigned, unapproved apps. I run Bartender, Alfred, Little Snitch, Charles Proxy, Dash, several non-native tools through homebrew (nginx, php-fpm, mariadb, mongo, nmap, burp, mitmproxy) and have several things I've tweaked in order to get everything working the way I want it to. I run Path Finder because Finder is the most awful file manager in the world. My Macbook is my car - it's the vehicle I use for all of my work on an ongoing, daily basis.
My iPhone, on the other hand, is an incredible, connected communications platform. I make tons of calls, reply to emails on the go, dictating many of them, and get on Skype or Viber when necessary. I browse the web, hop on IRC when someone messages me, and can even use Prompt to administer all of my servers. I stream new music through Songza (no Spotify allowed in South Africa!) and play games with PS3 quality graphics when I'm on the loo. But my phone has limited utility - have you ever worked with vim or written complex command-line pipes on a screen the size of your hand? It's frustrating and unecessary - just because it *can* be done doesn't mean you *should* be doing it. Your phone is NOT the same as your computer, and you should not have to have the same level of care and concern operating your drill as you do operating your car.

Without resorting to your strawman attack, do you realise how idiotic you're starting to sound?
Firstly, just because browsers *can* have plugins written in JS doesn't mean they *should* have plugins written in JS. We understand the JS attack vectors from many years of exploitation and defines. Trusting our money to a browser plugin, that may present a heretofore unknown attack surface, seems like a bad idea.
Secondly, anyone with a modicum of technical ability is using a proper Bitcoin client, or a lightweight client like Electrum. They are definitely *not* using a web wallet. We can, therefore, conclude that web wallets are for people without the technical chops required (such as they are) to run and backup a proper wallet. Your suggestion that these less-than-technically-minded individuals "use PHP signatures" and "check the source code before installing" is, frankly, laughable.

I think you mean cgi.fix_pathinfo=0.
Also, fix_pathinfo doesn't do what you're saying it does. From the conf file:
    ; cgi.fix_pathinfo provides *real* PATH_INFO/PATH_TRANSLATED support for CGI.  PHP's  
    ; previous behaviour was to set PATH_TRANSLATED to SCRIPT_FILENAME, and to not grok  
    ; what PATH_INFO is.  For more information on PATH_INFO, see the cgi specs.  Setting  
    ; this to 1 will cause PHP CGI to fix its paths to conform to the spec.  A setting  
    ; of zero causes PHP to behave as before.  Default is 1.  You should fix your scripts  
    ; to use SCRIPT_FILENAME rather than PATH_TRANSLATED.  
    ;

I can't agree with this early adopter nonsense. If you purchased a property and mining rights in Johannesburg in the 1880's during the gold rush you ran the risk of it being devoid of gold, and you merely had a large chunk of (pretty useless) land. The few that took the risk and got lucky ended up being extremely wealthy. Now that we're 130 years past that, they're old money, so why should we preserve that social order? Risk begets reward - someone who saves 10 000 BTC does so at the risk of a complete devaluation of the currency, but also at the potential for it becoming worth many millions. Between now and when it is worth that amount of money, the person may have to live like a pauper. Should we begrudge them their risk in order to preserve the status quo of people who took a risk years and years and years ago?

The same can happen in the property market. I have a friend who bought 4 apartments in an area in different blocks to spread his risk. Paid about R2 mil ($200k) per apartment off-plan.

Ok so you store the encrypted password in a database.
Then in the PHP/RoR/ASP source somewhere is a function that sends the password when a Forgot Password email is triggered. That calls the decrypt function - and ya know, if I've compromised the system I don't even need to know about your code obfuscation or where you're "hiding" your private key - I just need to dump the mail spool to disk without sending it (easy with an exim router/transport) and then write a little snippet that triggers a "forgot password" for every account.

I never mentioned wallets or keys in my entire post. Changing the topic does not nullify what I said. My post spoke only to your second sentence, nor your third.
Edit: also, just because the server receives the password does not mean it stores it. Good practice (including good practice for banks as defined by PCI-DSS and similar) is not to "not receive" passwords, it's to receive them over SSL, confirm they adhere to password strength standards (thereby negating client-side data manipulation), and then store a salted hash of the password. I won't get into a discussion as to how Strongcoin were able to move the funds, as that is not the point of my reply, I was merely correcting a fallacy in your post.
Edit2: on further reflection: given how trivial JavaScript injection is nowadays (XSS especially), pre-hashing a password is VERY VERY dangerous. It means that the server has no way of confirming that the password meets minimum strength, as it is just receiving a hash. Practical example: if Strongcoin/Blockchain used pre-hashed passwords before POSTing them, I can compromise the JavaScript on that page for a user so that it ignores the password they set and use and instead sets their password to a hash of test123. After they've transferred some BTC in to their account, I merely login on a clean browser with that password, and voila - instant money. *Pre-hashing is bad*.

Did I pay for the R&amp;D of the device? No? Well then it is at the manufacturer's discretion what they allow or disallow on the device.
In a very real sense - if I buy a drill, but choose to strip it and use it as a go cart motor, is that the manufacturer's purpose? No - and they may have odd screws to prevent me from stripping it. That I can void my warranty and buy a screwdriver to circumvent the intended purpose is almost inconsequential - the manufacturer dictates the intended purpose, not the consumer. If the manufacturer makes unreasonably irrational or unjustified choices in this regard, customers will vote with their wallets.
In Apple's case, customers have voted with their wallets and shown that Apple has made the correct choice, both for a smoother and more powerful web experience, but also from av accessibility perspective. I assume you're not disabled, but I can assure you that Flash wrecks accessibility for disabled users, and does not lend itself to the semantic web experience that Tim Berners-Lee envisioned.

Ok - so you paid ~$20 per BTC in February. Your Avalon arrived last Friday. Hopefully you'll have mined your $1500 back in 15 days, per your calculation. At best, after those 15 days there will be a difficulty jump, hopefully of less than the expected 25%, which means you'll automatically be earning 25% less from day 15 and every 2 weeks thereafter.
On the other hand, if you'd bought the 75 BTC and held on to them, you could sell 20 today to get your $1500 back, and still have 55 BTC in your wallet. Your electricity costs would be zero, your maintenance and performance tuning time would be zero, and you could sell a few Bitcoin or spend some whenever the desire arose.
In fact, even if you don't understand currency trading and don't want to play the market, there's some very sound advice [in this infographic]( Basically it says that you should purchase a fiat-fixed amount of Bitcoin every month, and sell the Bitcoin you've purchased every month (as long as the price per Bitcoin is above what you paid the month before, else just wait another month). This smooths over spikes and dips, as you're not trying to play the market. You would have made substantially more money if you followed this basic system.

The whole point of an exchange is that you're dealing in fiat currency. Thus, the exchange ***must*** comply with the rules and legislation imposed by the issuer of that fiat currency. To do otherwise is just plain illegal and, frankly, nonsensical. Why?
At the moment there's this big drive for people to be able to easily "acquire" Bitcoins through an exchange. What is more vital, though, is for people to be able to get *paid* for work, products, and services in Bitcoin. As they get paid they'll spend it on products and services that accept Bitcoin, and the cycle continues. If any efforts should be focused, it should be on making it easier for companies to pay employees or for goods/services in Bitcoin. If more B2B suppliers accepted Bitcoin that would definitely be a step in the right direction.

I'm sorry, but I simply cannot agree with you. If you want to drive a car, you have to get a license. If you want to own a dangerous animal, you have to get a license. Why do you support the police enforcing these rules, but heaven forbid the government enforces rules against businesses?
Imagine if I didn't have a driver's license, and I was driving around in a car, swerving like an idiot. By your logic, the police shouldn't arrest me, they should email me to tell me to get a driver's license. What's the threshold? Is it particularly low there because I could cause an accident leading to someone's death?
Business compliance sucks, but it is essential to allow government departments to not only protect individual customers from being defrauded, but also to prevent money laundering and other illicit activities. Businesses that operate on the fringe of the law make it harder for illegitimate businesses to be discovered, and make it harder for legitimate businesses to operate within the confines of the law. Thus, the threshold has to be low, since this is not a potential life and death matter for a few individuals, it is the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people that can be affected.
The lawmakers provide the legislation. If you don't want to fit in with the legislation, you are entitled to go live elsewhere, or to lobby for change. You are *not* entitled to break the law, and neither are businesses.

I think this is a knee-jerk reaction to a run-of-the-mill CloudFlare anti-DoS countermeasure. In any event, in order to use CloudFlare you have to use their DNS service, so the lookup is correct inasmuch as CloudFlare is returning an IP address (and not some malicious DNS hijack).

I'm sorry, and I don't mean to be rude, but you are blatantly incorrect. If there was any validity and value to client-side pre-hashing, don't you think every security expert in the world would recommend it?
Firstly, OP spoke about it being "nonencrypted", so I spoke to that. If he had said it was sent "unhashed" then I would have spoken to that.
Putting that aside, as a technical person you should understand how bad it is to implicitly trust client-side data. Here's what I said further down the thread with regards to that:
Given how trivial JavaScript injection is nowadays (XSS especially), pre-hashing a password is VERY VERY dangerous. It means that the server has no way of confirming that the password meets minimum strength, as it is just receiving a hash. Practical example: if Strongcoin/Blockchain used pre-hashed passwords before POSTing them, I can compromise the JavaScript on that page for a user so that it ignores the password they set and use and instead sets their password to a hash of test123. After they've transferred some BTC in to their account, I merely login on a clean browser with that password, and voila - instant money. *Pre-hashing is bad.*
Also, if you don't trust the transport mechanism (SSL/TLS) then you *definitely* should not trust the JavaScript on the page. If an MITM attacker can dump your password from the transport then clearly they can inject/modify the JavaScript. Thus, short of you unpacking and inspecting the JS every time before running it (tedious, impossible for 99% of the people using the system) you *have to trust* the transport mechanism. Even with sslstrip, an MITM attack is easily thwarted by paying attention to your browser's feedback on the connection security (BEAST attacks and potential RC4 weaknesses notwithstanding).
If you have some suggestion as to how you can possibly trust the client-side JavaScript and *not* trust the transport mechanism I'd love to hear it, but from the server's perspective web security rule number 1 is "never trust client-side validation or data" - including a pre-hashed password.

I don't think you've ever priced a software project. We did a complete CMS redesign and rebuild (from scratch!) for one of CNBC's web portals (including multi-platform mobile apps and video content delivery systems). They paid $350 000 over about a year. The team consisted of two 4-person SCRUM teams full time for that year, as well as various other managerial/admin/SCRUM-management staff on a more ad-hoc basis.
There is simply *no way* this project comes close to that complexity. Hosting is a trivial expense: with a director box (LVS DR architecture) + three app servers + two DB servers w/data sharded across them, CDN, DoS mitigation - you're talking about *maybe* $2000/month. I'd hire 2 junior-ish devs ($2k/month ea.), 1 designer ($3.5k/month), 1 DB dev ($4k/month), 1 UX expert ($3.5k/month), 2 mid-level devs ($3k/month ea.), 1 senior dev/architect ($4k/month), 1 sysadmin ($3k/month) = $28 000/month. That is a HUGE team, but nonetheless. I would expect them to architect and deliver the beta version for users to test within 3 months. Another 3 months after that we'd do a data migration and cutover to the new site. Total cost = $180 000 (including hosting). Slap on an extra $20k capex for equipment, and we've spent **$200 000** on building the new forum. Since the staff were all on 6-month contracts, at this stage the staff requirement goes down to DB dev (in an administrative role at this stage), senior dev, 1 mid-level dev, and the sysadmin, which means that to continuously add new functionality to the site and possibly work on non-forum related projects we're talking about a monthly maintenance of **$16 000/month** (including hosting). That means there's enough money to run the forum (without additional donations and assuming the exchange rate doesn't increase) for 2 years.

I don't get why everyone is obsessed with Africa? As an African I can tell that few people here and online understand the landscape. Preface: I'm not saying Bitcoin won't find a modicum of success here, but I don't think it'll be the unifying currency everyone imagines. Why? Firstly, there is little requirement for sending money across borders. There are many immigrant workers, but most of them either take cash with them when they go back home, or they use Western Union. Migrant workers have a million methods of sending money within a country, so that's a market Bitcoin won't easily tap. What about as a general use currency? Well, in South Africa, for example, there have been many, MANY operators and companies that have launched mobile payments systems to try and get widespread adoption - they've all utterly failed. Minibus taxis (a primary form of public transport) cost about $1 to ride. All the people piled in the back of the taxi have to pass their money forward to the driver. There's a mob mentality in play where if anyone passes the incorrect amount forward the whole taxi goes ballistic - bordering on violent. Taxis are volatile and dangerous. Mobile payments are not well suited to this, and even if they found a way around the practical problems, taxi drivers like cash. They can hide it from the government more easily than they can hide a digital trail, and they can spend it anywhere. Think about how easy it will be for the government to track a taxi's earnings - all they need is to send one person on a ride to get his Bitcoin address, and they know exactly how much he's making.
Bitcoin is awesome, and we will continue to support it on all of our online stores (in Africa:) - but it isn't the "solution" to a non-existent problem - at least not yet.

What if within NameCoin there was a fictitious .payme TLD, and everyone had the opportunity to register a .payme TLD. Then if I wanted to receive payments, people could pay  and it would do a lookup for the relevant SRV record for fluffyponyza.payme to retrieve my most current declared Bitcoin address. To take it to its logical extension, we could have _coin as the protocol, and then _btc._coin.fluffyponyza.payme = Bitcoin, whilst _ltc._coin.fluffyponyza.payme = Litecoin ad infinitum.

The bank never "cheated" on the OP. By your analogy, and given the sparse evidence to the contrary, the OP was unreliable, treated his girlfriend badly, and occasionally smacked her around. Finally, in desperation, the girlfriend dumped him. Coincidentally, she dumped him when he was texting another girl, and so OP assumes that the dumping is related to that. Meanwhile, the girlfriend doesn't even KNOW about the texting, she's dumped OP because he's a douchebag (not to say OP is actually a douchebag, just rolling with the metaphor).

I have to ask - did you not read two sentences later where he explains why? Here: "you can even safely use cloud storage and an attacker will never even know the file contains a bitcoin wallet at all much less the value of it." Having an encrypted wallet.dat, even if you obscure it, is still something that can be found and potentially attacked. A TrueCrypt container can be made to just look arbitrary.

No, Mtgox clearly either opened the bank account or continued to run it with every intention of trading and exchanging money. There is *no* excuse for that - it is flat out illegal if not fraudulent. As far as the law is concerned, ignorance is not an excuse - the onus is on you to make yourself compliant. Why should the government have a friendly chat to you when you're doing something that is illegal? Those government departments exist to *prosecute* people who operate outside of the bounds of the law, not to have a chat to them and let them off with a warning.

Ok so according to the warrant, here are the two questions asked:


So by that question, the definition of a money transmitter is "a company who accepts funds from customers and sends the funds based on customer's instructions". Mtgox clearly does that, so by that definition they are a money transmitter.

 - we already accept Bitcoin, and we were the first store in Africa (we think:) to do so. Our payment processor says that credit card charges are 3.9%, but that seems to only be for a certain volume, because we're paying like 5%. With PayPal we pay an additional 1.5% to get the money into the country, so we get knocked there as well.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:14:25
Non-compliance means you are escaping scrutiny, but also that you are not compliant with any charges and/or levies, and would not have had to pay fines that may otherwise have been levied against you during the period of non-compliance. All of which are for the "gain" of the company, thus fraud.

Yes - and whilst you're there buy up a bunch of BTC at early adoption rates, put them in a new cold wallet by following the same process outlined above, and then retrieve it in the present. You'll be so wealthy you won't care much about the original cold wallet, thus negating the need to follow this entire process.

Congratulations (not sarcastically:)
You know own 0,00000198% of all Bitcoins that will ever be in circulation. Which is a good thing:)
EDIT: for giggles I thought "what if you owned that percentage of the USD currently in circulation just in the US?" Best estimate I could find of that is 850 Billion USD from 2008, so let's use that as a number. So the same percentage would be $1 683 000. Give Bitcoin a bit of time and your $50 000 will be worth a significant sum of money:)

Don't forget that you can use BitPay, which will handle the conversion to USD/EUR/whatever at that day's rate (since I assume all your costs are EUR-anchored), which saves you all of the maintenance/calculating hassle. Just send them a BitPay link and done.

One of the major local issues we have is lack of a proper logistics infrastructure. We use the postal service a lot, and it's gotten better, but it's nowhere near the postal services in Europe. Two months ago two of the major postal hubs ground to a halt due to an illegal, unprotected strike that went on for over a month and resulted in the striking workers being fired - we had packages that took 5 weeks to get delivered! Admittedly, this sort of major incident does not happen all that often, but when it does it's a major disruption to business and it kills confidence in online buying and in the postal service. Courier services are expensive ($8 to one of the 3 major city centers around SA for a small 1kg parcel, but like $17 to everywhere else, vs the $2.38 for the same parcel counter-to-counter with the post office) and most people prefer to save money.
There is confident online spending, though, which is a good thing. Payment methods *are* a problem - PayPal is not widely supported from a consumer perspective, and there are only about 10 million credit cards (mostly owned by people paranoid about using them online). That's not to say that Bitcoin is *the* answer for consumers online, as buying Bitcoin here is still markedly above spot, but it is a definite step in the right direction and may just change the face of online shopping here a bit if we can streamline the consumers-getting-their-hands-on-it bit:)

I know - I actually couldn't believe my eyes when I saw people sending money to him. I just figure Bitcoin is like cash (but better!) - so would I take out a large denomination note and give it to some random dude on the street corner because he says he'll give me double?

I use deterministic wallets (in Electrum) for my cold wallet. A brainwallet with a sufficiently long phrase (NOT a "password", but a nonsensical phrase that only has meaning to you) will also work.
My hot wallet syncs to DropBox every 15 minutes - you can use rsync for this, with whichever fancy UI you like, or if you're on a Mac I recommend [ChronoSync]( for its gzipped versioning ability. As long as you have an encrypted wallet with a *strong* password, using a service like DropBox (that could be compromised) isn't an issue.

PayPal is a transaction processing system built on top of cash. It provides an easy way to transfer money between PayPal users and make payments on supporting sites, but only once you have money in their system (by transferring it from your bank account or withdrawing it from your credit/debit card). By the very nature of the business they are in, they sometimes have to handle disputes for transactions that occur within their walled garden.
Bitcoin is like cash.
Therefore, anyone can build a transaction processing system on top of Bitcoin that provides the same functionality. In fact, PayPal could easily support Bitcoin as a method of loading or withdrawing funds to and from your PayPal account.
**tl;dr - Bitcoin ≠ PayPal. Bitcoin ≈ Cash.**
PS. We accept Bitcoin and PayPal on [many of our ecommerce sites]( We love PayPal. Never had an incident with them. You don't have to automatically hate PayPal to love Bitcoin, just like you don't have to hate Microsoft to love OS X or Linux.

If you look [two comments up in this thread]( you'll notice I said "Firstly, just because browsers *can* have plugins written in JS doesn't mean they *should* have plugins written in JS. We understand the JS attack vectors from many years of exploitation and defines. Trusting our money to a browser plugin, that may present a heretofore unknown attack surface, seems like a bad idea."
Of those three possible reasons to compile a binary Firefox extension instead of using JS, a Bitcoin client could, arguably, meet two.
* It could use more complex/powerful encryption mechanisms than are currently available in JS (and run them much faster than the JS equivalent), thus meeting the first requirement for performance/functionality beyond what JS can currently deliver.
* It could use the Bitcoin libraries directly and deliver new functionality without waiting for the [bitcoinJS]( project to catch-up and offer those features, thus meeting requirement two.

HTTP POSTs with passwords are almost ALWAYS unencrypted; SSL *is* encryption. Why would you double-encrypt the password when you already trust the transport mechanism? Client-side encryption would have to be JavaScript based, which means exposing the encryption key and mechanism to anyone who can "view source" (even if it is the public key). There's no real value in pre-encrypting or pre-hashing the password, as SSL already does the job. There's a reasonable technical discussion on it on [this StackExchange post]( but here is the relevant bit: "Because it's a lot of extra work for zero gain. Such a system would not be more secure. It might even be less secure because it gives the false impression of being more secure, leading users to adopt less secure practices (like password reuse, dictionary passwords, etc)."

Yep - [as I mentioned elsewhere]( I already prototyped a system last year for us that hit our bitcoind running on a locked down, relatively isolated server and ran getnewaddress for a transaction, finally confirming the transaction on our ecommerce platform when 2 confirms were in the blockchain. But that didn't give us a way of exchanging to local currency quickly - and until our suppliers accept BTC we have no choice but to exchange in order to pay for the stock.
