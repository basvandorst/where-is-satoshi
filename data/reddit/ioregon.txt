I’m so fucking mad at myself for not buying bitcoin when it was @ $220. I kept trying to talk to everyone around me about it and nobody got it and my fiancée at the time basically thought I would be spending money on internet money that I couldn’t really spend anywhere we live. I just kinda forgot about it, and look at it now. Fuck

Even yesterday an hour before fat tits resigned, people were spewing such sage advice "I predict withdraws will open up in a few days and the price will skyrocket!"
Time to eat that crow you optimistic nerds!

There should also be a bot that says if you dont currently have Money/bitcoin in mtgox, don't worry about it.  This will all be over before you could have funds wired to your account.

Bitcoin seems cool. I have never had any.
I like the idea of tipping people.

I am in the US. It takes like 20 business days for them to verify my account.  10 business days to wire transfer money after I am verified. And that is beside all the other crap that us going on. 
Also,  when you sign up,  there are notices about the transfer and withdrawal freezes.
