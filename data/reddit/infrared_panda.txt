That was the top. Hype is over. Steady from now on.

@_date: 2017-08-30 05:01:24
Ok thank you

I apologize for my "laziness" and my ignorance, I am just wondering, how then would you by bitcoin if not using a service such as coinbase or GDAX?

Thanks, apparently people assumed it was me attempting to flaunt wealth, when in actuality, I just wanted it because I'm a crypto nerd :P
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:39:54

Holy shit �� who pooped in your cereal this morning hahaha!
