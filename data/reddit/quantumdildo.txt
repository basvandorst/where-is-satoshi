There Is A Reason Why You're Not Supposed To Capitalize Every Word In A Title

you could've done that without trying to act like an asshole to someone who was trying to help you and actually fix the problem you're posting about, instead of just trolling the people who i guess have control of your assets.
the 13 year-old route works too, i'm sure.

oh god why

I'm going to have to agree with here. Increase in the monetary base can lead to inflation but that doesn't mean it *is* inflation. This is a pretty important distinction to make in academics, at least. I would be hard pressed to find an academic source that uses of your definition.
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:48:06


That is demand-pull inflation. It happens in certain circumstances. There's also cost-push inflation. They both affect price levels for different reasons. It helps to call price level change 'inflation' and to differentiate among the causes.
As I replied to a source from the Cleveland Fed says:


@_date: 2014-08-05 19:39:55


Whoa now, no need to be so hostile over economics definitions.
I would like to point out that one of the sources of your Wikipedia citation point towards post-Keynes economics using inflation to describe price levels. In the [Cleveland Fed source's conclusion]( (31):


The link to the July 2004 introductory statement is unavailable, so if you have an available source do let me know.

did he get this fixed, though? probably not. he just said "lol i trold u" and only after the second support technician had to coax him to actually do what he was supposed to be doing did he recommend any sort of alternative. but did he get that sweet, sweet circlejerk feeling? oh you betcha'.
also, the fact that people have put thousands of dollars onto these sites but don't know anything about their account/security policies makes me cringe. it's like these people *want* to be scammed.
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:54:25
What's your alternate plan? Putting all of your cash into a virtual currency that has zero intrinsic value? Good luck with that.
By the way, in case you weren't aware through this entire discussion: Bitcoin is a currency, but it's one that less and less people are willing to exchange goods &amp; services for. Guess what that does to its value? Enjoy that 'investment' while it still exists.
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:05:17


You do realize that this is the entire reason why people invest in stocks &amp; bonds, right? So the extra money they can't use retains its value for the future?
Because if you're seriously so fiscally-irresponsible that you're actually being impacted by negative interest and inflation, then you might be that imbecile.

this is exactly the line of reasoning used to justify killing people for drawings of Muhammad 
@_date: 2015-05-26 07:00:23
yet all of it is because you can't take a joke. not like you were going to use their services, anyway -- but now that they made a funny at your expense? Quote the OP, "Need to cause them some pain."
What's even more funny is that the oh-so-innocent behavior you're encouraging is exactly the kind of mob-mentality that makes businesses like Grubhub avoid Bitcoin.
So good job, keep digging your own grave, while the only people that use Bitcoin continues to be people laundering money and providing illegal services like drugs and child pornography.

for when you want to anonymously send flowers to that person with a court order against you
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:22:06
Oh, god, I'm sorry. 
I hate to break this to you, but money is not a 'store of value'. It's meant to be exchanged for things of value. Currency is only worth what it can be exchanged for.
That's why if you have a lot of extra money, you (for instance) buy property. The intrinsic value of the property might not change, but the amount of currency it's worth will. So, when you finally sell that property, you essentially get back the money you bought it for, but more or less of it depending on inflation and other factors.
For the record, I'm not down-voting you. This is a pretty enlightening discussion honestly.

In the amount of time it took for you to write that frothy diarrhea of a reply you could have easily created an account using a Guerrilla Mail email address and donated Bitcoin.
But, again, *you're not actually interested in donating*, so who gives  a fuck
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:51:38


They care about donations for the charitable service they offer, not what you think the 'purpose of Bitcoin' is.
If signing up and logging into a service is going to stop you from donating to it, then it doesn't sound like you even care about donating to it in the first place.
@_date: 2015-05-29 04:00:57
No, I'm just pointing out how stupid you look when you suggest that the only reason why you won't donate to a good cause is because you would have to create a single throwaway account on Khan Academy using a single auto-generated throwaway mail address.
Especially considering that you were willing to use a Reddit account to argue a stupid point, but are somehow assed by the concept of making one to give donations.
Keep beating on that straw man, you cheap, uncharitable idiot

Thanks for the suggestion! I hadn't come across that site yet. I took a quick look at their rules and they look (for the most part) pretty player friendly. I added it to my shortlist for now. Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:16:26
I'm also looking at bitcoinrush.io. No surrender option it seems, but their rules appear to give the house only a .26948% edge. I'll still have to look at reviews to make sure it's a legit operation.
* Blackjack pays 3:2
* Dealer Stays on all 17's
* Double on any 2 cards
* Double after Split is allowed
* Can hit aces after a split
* Split up to 2 hands
* 6 decks, reshuffled every hand
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:24:49
The one site I'm heavily considering is  but I'm hesitant because their Blackjack payout is 6:5 which gives house something like a 1.45% edge -- but if that's the only drawback, and there's no other sites that beat it, I'll probably go with it.
