Wow. This is crazy info. Thanks. 
How many digits would I have to change for it not to be a trivial task?
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:28:24
I don't understand why that is true. A machine would not know which digits had been changed or by what degree. Why would it be easy to brute force it?
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:32:46
Four bucks in there

And also, if the encrypted private keys go missing from one of the three locations, we would have at least 24 hours to move all of the funds. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:29:53
I bet you changed digits 3,6 and 9 down by two degrees. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:55:50
Crazy that it costs two bucks to send though, eh? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:22:59
Cool. Thanks. 80 cents though. It's still not cheap. 
If I put in 0.00005 how long do you think it would take?
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:24:49
See below. The guys at confirmtx put the payment through in under two hours for four bucks. Crazy!

And anyway, if the password isn't long and hard to remember; they can just brute force that, as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:47:36
I know about using Tails to do cold storage on an air gap laptop. I just can't see how brute force could crack a private key that had been altered. Would a brute force attack involve using the public address to push the private key out?
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:39:31
Ah. So I think this is new information. You're saying that by using these formats, I CAN actually write down a private key  on paper that will not function until I pop it in a program and add the magic password, yeah?
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:57:54
Yup. Fucking coin base. How low could I go on a wallet with custom fees?
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:14:48
Yup. He's soon going to be faking space for them on a flat earth. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:19:02
These guys fixed it in under two hours. Payment confirmed. 
Give me an address and I'll send you ten bucks for the help. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:01:58
Wow. Lots of options. Which one would you choose to do?
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:32:22
But the attacker wouldn't know if it were three or five or ten letters changed and/or which Ines were changed. Is it really only 4 billion under these circumstance?
I mean people leave private keys in their safes. Surely it's better to partially encrypt them, according to your own simple methods, anyway, no?
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:38:03
Yup. Sounds right. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:11:55
Do you mean the real private key could be obtained easily with machine power?
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:29:53
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:30:54
Do you think if it has taken one month, it might just cancel itself in a few more weeks' time?
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:56:19
What's the most used coin for small payments?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:46:10
I'm going to buy a trezor, folks. Thank you for the discussion. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:40:53
Can I do this with any type of coin address or only bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:37:52
I mean what are the chances of somebody who is capable of brute forcing a slightly changed private key, actually coming across it in your house or being given it by a cat burglar who stole it from you?
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:33:53
I don't like computers. It always goes wrong. I just want bits of paper with the same info in three different locations.
