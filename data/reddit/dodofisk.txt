I've done some research.. hence why I'm hedging my bets with ripple. Got in when it was 20 cents so sitting petty currently.  Like the stability (or illusion of stability with the escrowing of coins) and think it has a high chance of adoption by financial institutions more so than most alts. I most likely will be wrong but i feel bitcoin is like the MySpace... breakthrough but soon replaced by more efficient technologies.

can someone explain the coinbase price. it used to be only a few hundred either side.  now its over a thousand

Question... with coinbase etc sending out emails about matching your bitcoin amount with equal value of the fork coin is this leading to a flood of btc purchase?
I ask as btc soars while even Eth is dropping real low and normal they move together

Screw coinbase.. tried to buy several times in the dip.  Crashed every time

Literally got involved 4 or so days ago at 4200... what bad timing. I'm not planning on selling. Value has dropped about 30 or so percent. 
Even if China bans it I'm certain some other county will step in and take over the production at some point. Just to much profit?
From the consensus wait till the end of the month when a final decision will be made and perhaps buy more then is my game plan. Thoughts?

I was tempted to buy some more this am at 3000.. should have. I'd have sold so a quick 400 bucks or held long term. Oh well

A friend of mine got me to invest a week before the Chinese dump. So annoying as this yr because of house refurb I have very little to invest last year I was swimming in cash. 
Just bought 200 bucks at 5680.. have a 3rd of a coin presently. 
Looking for the next big dip to buy some more up
