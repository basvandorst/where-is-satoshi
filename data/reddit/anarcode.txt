Bitcoin address not IP address.
Monero scalability will be solved at about the same time as Bitcoin with LN or MW but I doubt Bitcoin will ever have decent privacy. There's nothing wrong with that though. There are uses for completely transparent coins. I believe all government transactions should be transparent for example.

Gold was sound money but it was inconvenient so we allowed the exchange of receipts which opened the door to manipulation. Bitcoin could be sound money but the lack of fungibility will again allow for manipulation such as blacklisting addresses. Monero is the soundest money at the moment.

Free market doesn't mean no laws. Where did you get that idea? However, I don't believe in laws that protect me from myself, only laws that protect us from each other. If you voluntarily make a trade and then realise that it was bad then the law would need to protect you from yourself which is idiotic.

I completely agree with you. People don't accept the consequences of their own actions and look at governments to bail them out when they do something stupid. There was no fraud so the government should stay out of it.

Today Bitcoin is slow and expensive but only because it's the most used. Once everyone tries Litecoin/Ripple/Monero they'll suffer in the same way with high miner fees and slow transactions and then you'll be back because Bitcoin will have some nice Lightning wallets or perhaps Lightning will be used on Litecoin or Monero. Ripple? You're really going to do that to your family and friends. You must really hate them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:12:43
If your favourite exchange doesn't do the things you want, the way you want, use another. If you can't find one that operates to your liking, build one. That's how the free market works and it is by far the most effective and ethical way to distribute wealth to the ones that deserve it, voluntarily.

It seems like a weird post to me and I don't understand the incentive. Another possibility is an attempt to cause a dip in price by having more people sell. If there's a slew of these on different channels, it'll be suspicious.

Change to POS to eliminate this problem by lowering the (mining/staking/minting/baking) bar to a Raspberry Pi.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:13:57
Decentralized implies decentralization of power and control, not node or computing. Nodes in Bitcoin have very little power and miners have a considerable amount so you can measure Bitcoin decentralization by mostly considering the miners.
Users, programmers and exchanges also have some power and the proportions vary from coin to coin. In a POS system, the miners have none and the power that would have been given to the miners is given to the token holders instead.

POS and Tangle do a better job at decentralization. You short Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:16:32
How is that different than POW? Wouldn't someone with the most money buy the most miners and continue to get the most miner rewards that would allow them to buy even more miners?

As in "waaay more" do you mean about 25%?
Just a quick sample and I'm sure you can cherry pick but BTC on Oct 23rd about 347k and ETH about 468k.
Also remember that 1 BTC confirmation is waaay more confirmed than 1 ETH and by waaay more I mean 1000 times more confirmed.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:58:23
I'm surprised that merchants are willing to take the risk of double spend for these types of transactions. Once Lightning proves to be a reliable form of instant payment, it won't be a problem but we're at least 6 months to a year away from that.

Subaddresses PR was just merged. It's like Bitcoin HD wallets but better I think. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:20:15
Agreed, I don't think it'll happen. Ironically the power that miners have wasn't considered during Ethereum's upgrade plan to POS which is based on game theory and incentives.
Still lots of gains to be made in BTC short to mid term but if POS proves to be just as resilient, it will collapse shortly after mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:27:04
Anyone with a lot of resources has the same influence. With POW, they just buy more miners. With POS, they just buy more coin.
The difference is that with POS, the coin holders have the power that miners have on POW and they can influence direction or govern via a meritocracy. With POW, the coin holders are almost powerless and all they can do is switch to another coin if they're not happy with the direction.
Suppose the decision to support SegWit was decided solely by the owners of Bitcoin instead of the miners. Do you think the process would have been faster or slower? Don't you think the owners of Bitcoin have the best and vested interest? The they do have the most invested by a large margin. Suppose the total market cap of Bitcoin is 100 Billion and the miners own about $1 Billion of mining equipment. Why would the group with 1% stake into Bitcoin, the mining equipment, have so much power over the 99%?

Fees reflect cost and demand and since BTC and ETH have equivalent POW costs, we are left with demand. Once ETH demand rises, the fees will follow but for now ETH is cheaper just like all other alt coins.

Then you have to attack infinitely and pay the infinite cost. Quite simply, anyone who owns a currency that's being attacked will trade for one that isn't. I imagine that this could be done automatically in the future with cross crypto bridges.

A simultaneous 51% attack on all currencies would be practically impossible and much harder to execute than attacking just one.

Because in its current state, miners have too much power. The idea is to have a good balance of power between all the stakeholders and that includes bitcoin owners. POS helps in this regard hence the resistance from some miners who see LN as the bitcoin POS layer.
