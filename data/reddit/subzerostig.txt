Yeah this guy probably contributes to half of all the tips of bitcointip. It's really uplifting to see a selfless person that is in bitcoin as a currency rather than people who see it more profit. My belief is that while still treat bitcoin as something to be invested and not as currency then it won't become truly global. This guy sets an example for all of us: Spreading the word and giving small amounts(Or large) to get people interested. 
Funnily enough I heard about bitcoins a year ago, but didn't really see the point. Dat feel man.

Now if only they were real bitcoins. I definetly wouldn't want to eat them then!

I have to agree with this statement. Bitcoin isn't for hoarding it's for using and what better use that bitcointip

Yet another sign that society isn't happy with the way money works at the moment. Even though this article doesn't mention bitcoin, the idea of a monetary reform adds momentum to the rise of bitcoin
I think that we're at the beginning of a new state of independence thanks to the internet. We have torrents and now we just need to get bitcoin as mainstream as torrents

TBH I see bitcointip as what bitcoin is perfect for - An anonymous currency that doesn't require you to sign up for anything to be able to receive. All this stock market talk is just about how much 1 BTC is worth, whereas the true potential of bitcoin is in small simple anonymous transactions. I'm very tempted to buy a small amount of bitcoin to tip some people.

I'm going to be honest when I say I skimmed the article rather than read it properly. I stand corrected.

While GirlFawkesy is definetly not the most intelligent, it still shows how insecure mtgox is and how proper warning/care needs to be taken place. My friend once lost BTC through this(thankfully not a huge amount).
I hope that users take this advice to head and stop the scamming. This could really damage bitcoins reputation - MTGox is the biggest exchange and we really don't need widespread hacking reports

Holy shit 1BTC, are you sure you know the price of one? You sure are generous
I would tip someone, but I have no BTC except the free karma(*Hint* :D )
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:24:58
Are you aware that you've actually given me 2 x 0.05 BTC for 0.1 BTC? Because I'm not complaining :)

Tell me and I'll cash it into your account

The reason these are worth that amount of money is that people think that they will be worth something later on. There are also coins such as litecoin that are fairly popular. However a fork of bitcoin will be worth nothing as people won't invest in something for the future that is a rip-off, whereas alt-coins are ripoffs disguised as something like bitcoin

Did anyone actually expect them to deliver on time? Why have this hardware able to make consumers money and not you? A better use it to generate money before selling it to them after it's become worthless. Oh wait...

But BFLs never arrive. And once you buy an ASICMiner share you're entitled to it for life. ASICMiner is also on the forefront of hardware development. They sell old hardware for thousands of pounds. Also, you can sell your ASICMiner shares back, you have to earn it back with actual hardware

perhaps the blockchain size? If bitcoin is to become big then something about the blockchain will need to change

Buying bitcoin was actually pretty easy. Just add funds to your account and buy. But this was when bitcoin wasn't worth much. I'm sure you'll want to shop around. There can be quite a bit of latency between the order and confirmation, but it shouldn't be too long. PM me for more info

Aw, the little red cross has appeared marking a failed transaction. We can't steal from hardleft121s seemingly infinite supply of coins. I guess potential hackers had better look elsewhere ^NASA ^anyone?

I'm going to continue this but apply it to 1 year ago. 1 year ago there were ~9.1m BTC at a value of ~$5.2. So back then we would of been printing ~$36,000 which would give a yearly total of ~$13,000,000.
However, the price of bitcoin has gone up(which is pretty obvious I know). The USD value of 1 BTC x The total bitcoins in circulation has increased by 3200%. The amount of dollars being 'mined' per day has increased by 1600%, but we had the block reward halving
 The rapid increase in bitcoin makes working out the net value of all the bitcoins not reliant on how many bitcoins, but by their worth(As hinted by OP). While it would be an extreme bubble to see the net value of bitcoin worth ~$35 billion in a years time I think that the increase in media attention, rapid deployal of ASICs(leading to increase network hash rate) will continue to make bitcoins harder to get. Bitcoins are not currently based on usefulness, they are based on how easy it is to get them. With the average person not being able to get any significant quantity by mining at the moment and most GPU miners shutting down within 6 months the only way to get bitcoins would be to trade them. This could/is lead(ing) to a potentially sticky situation where the main exchanges and pools control the money. Think about it, if all the pools and exchanges are shut down then what happens? There are enough solo miners to make the chance of mining a block still impossibly rare and no way to get them. My point is that exchanges and pools have too much influence over a currency that is meant to be decentralized. The network will continue, but crippled and will never return to it's former glory. The way to solve this would be increased adoption of bitcoin, if a major exchange goes down then it's not too much of an issue if your local store trades bitcoins, because in a scenario like that bitcoins are common, everywhere and easier to buy. Only problem is that that's going to take a long time and bitcoin still has a lot to prove.
Well I've really gone off on a tangent here. Oh well.

We definetly do need some sort of online donation system. Sure, we have bitpay, but that seems to be an online payment scheme and as such limits the flexibility. Open source projects that rely on donations would probably receive more funding if they accepted bitcoins. I think point is that we need to make bitcoin easy to use and accessible to most of the web users

But those coins won't be part of the network and will be worth nothing. They also won't be supported. You're basically creating a new alt-coin from bitcoin. There is no incentive for anyone else to use this split off from bitcoin. At least with other coins eg. litecoin they have different protocols to try and fix some problems with bitcoin
