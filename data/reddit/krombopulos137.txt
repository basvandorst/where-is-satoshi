Because 21 million coins means that the supply is ultimately capped. Unlike dollars where more can be printed at any time (devaluing the ones on your pocket) or even gold, where a whole mountain could be discovered tomorrow. 
The supply cap makes bitcoin deflationary (they will inevitably be worth more and more). Where dollars are inflationary (they will inevitably be worth less and less)

It's the federal reserve that prints out a shit ton of bills, whenever they want and without telling anyone. Thereby devaluing the dollar. Bitcoin is a zero-sum game. Coins are mined at a predictable rate. 
Since there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. The Money supply with Bitcoin is designed to increase in value.
If that makes it Superior to USD, then so be it

On a warm bullish evening
On a train bound for Luna
I met up with a Hodler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
at the ticker of exchanges
The boredom overtook us
And he began to speak
He said, "Son, I've made a mint
Out of tradin' people's crypto
And knowin' what the odds were
By the way they told their lies.
So if you don't mind my sayin'
I'm on Gdax and Coinbases
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice."
So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy,
You gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hodl 'em,
Know when to fodl 'em,
Know when to walk away,
And know when to run.
You Never trade for fiat money
Buy when its dippin' if you're able.
There'll be time enough for lambos
When the trading's done.
Every trader knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to trade away
And knowin' what to keep.
'Cause every coin's a winner,
And every coin's a loser,
And the best that you can hope for
Is an All Time High when you sleep."
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the ticker
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The trader he broke even
And in his final words
I found a coin that I could keep
You got to know when to hodl 'em,
Know when to fodl 'em,
Know when to walk away,
And know when to run.
You Never trade for fiat money
Buy when its dippin' if you're able.
There'll be time enough for lambos
When the trading's done.

No. It's supposedly the fastest transactions (thus the name) but it is not anonymous. The only other coin that even claims to be anonymous is Zcash. But they're full of shit.

The technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "innovators," followed by "early adopters". Next come the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "laggards".
As soon as the early majority gets it, you'll be able to use Bitcoin practically everywhere.

"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today."
The value of Bitcoin has increased exponentially since its beginning. But it's not too late if you invest. The $4,400 you spend on a Bitcoin today can still be $100,000 in 10 years time...

BTC will fall (short term) but will bounce back with a vengeance before the end of the year ($10k) when the wall street money starts pouring in. A lowered price now makes buying even more attractive. It will be more of a commodity and less of a currency.
Hopefully BCH will hold around $2K as it becomes the new go-to crypto for transactions.
What is NOT going to happen is a complete flip-flop.

Only 0.5% (less than one half of one percent) of the global M2 supply of fiat has been invested in the *entire* crypto market cap. Imagine what the numbers will be like when that number rises to a paltry 2% let alone 10%! These are reasonable projections for 5 and 10 years into the future.
So yes, the market cap can continue to grow at this pace. Especially with the collapse of currencies like the Venezuelan Bolivar and the Iranian Rial.
