I can't believe it. This has just happened to me a second time. First time was with BTC - now I'm having the same issue with ETH. So pissed right now. 3 days to sent my own coin is not my idea of 'security'. This is the last transaction I'll be doing with Coinbase.

Tried that last night 3 times. Woke up this morning and it's asking me to submit verification again without a reason why my previous submission was declined

Ah man you cracked me up ������

That's weird. I also just got this issue about 30 mins ago... Quite annoyed to be honest. I went through the verification process again and the status still hasn't changed... I'll update this tomorrow if I got it through quicker than the stated 72 hour period.

I wish you and your missus the very best of luck in the future!

Buy it on Amazon! Took about 2 weeks to arrive for me in Ireland. I too didn't buy direct because of the delivery times.

Just to let you know, I eventually just waited the few days for the coins to be released ��

It's some entertainment alright!

This sucks. CoinBase is down for maintenance on my end.

Back to 15 now, and I can't login to Coinbase to buy :(
