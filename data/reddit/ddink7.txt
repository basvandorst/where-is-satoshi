Why would it be unethical to overrule the miners? Miners are just one part of the ecosystem and if the rest of bitcoin users disagree, why should miners be able to hold everybody hostage?

Got to love the "transaction fees will go up" argument. The bitcoin network only has a limited capacity for processing transactions. Compare it to internet bandwidth, if you will. Once a pipe fills up, the solution isn't "charge your customers more for internet access in order to drive off the excess demand." The solution is "lay more fiber to accomodate the additional demand."
Granted, if you let transaction fees float high enough, the fees will eventually drive off the excess demand. But I'm not sure that decreasing the transaction volume (i.e. getting fewer people to use bitcoin/use it less frequently) is the solution here!
What a dumbass.
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:39:37
Of course price affects usage--higher price means less usage! Is that the solution we are aiming for? That people stop using bitcoin?

What about the coins that were "stolen" when they were only $20 each? Picking the highest possible number out of four years of trading is disingenuous at best.
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:41:05
Correct. If there were a trillion acceptable possibilities, it would only take 165 billion years to generate such an address rather than 165 quadrillion years. Six orders of magnitude. Winning.

The scalability problem is keeping the network from being able to support that many transactions.

It's mathematically provable.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:23:37
It also actually works (compared to MSC)
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:07:14
Very good. Let's assume the number of "acceptable" addresses was 1,000,000.
The odds of generating any specific address of 24 characters is 62^24, so the odds decrease from 1.041 x 10^43 to 1.041 x 10^37.
Even hashing at a trillion operations per second, it would take a maximum of 329,834,880,414,018,384.75 years to create such an address, or an average of half that, so 164,917,440,207,009,192.38 years. That's 164.92 quadrillion years. Or about the equivalent of winning the Powerball several times in a row.

As I understand it, the only concern would be that *somebody* preserve the cryonic shells. It need not be a corporation, nor need it be an entity with financial motives. There's no reason why ideologically motivated entities could not take over at whatever point Alcor or the other host becomes in danger of insolvency.
I personally think the whole thing is silly, but as Vitalik says, the only debate is zero versus non-zero. Non-zero could very well be infinitesimal, but it still beats zero every time. That's assuming you even want to be brought back at some indefinable time in the future, or that you would even be mentally capable of adapting to the resurrection process or the sociological/technological changes around you. People have gone insane over less.

One could argue that:
1) Canada is less of a "police state" because of a general lack of terrorist activities.
2) Canada is not generally the target of terrorist activities because their military is not deployed, by and large, in politically-sensitive areas.
3) Canada's military doesn't need to be deployed in politically-sensitive areas as a stabilizing force, because the U.S. military already fills that role.
4) Canada can spend less on their military, and thus more on healthcare, because they fall under a de facto umbrella of U.S. military protection.
One could consequently argue that Canada is in some ways a better place to live *because* of the U.S.
Or not. Just a thought.
P.S. I have grave concerns about the "police state" type actions of the U.S. government. I was seriously concerned about the NSA before most Americans even realized it existed. I was gravely concerned with the passage of the Patriot Act and related legislation. I'm not saying the U.S. is heading in a good direction per se, just that there can be some benefit to all of it for our Northerly Neighbor.

Both of which are theoretical. For the rest of your life, both Bitcoin and Ethereum will be creating new coins.

I'll try to find a link after while--there was a Youtube video from one of the bitcoin conferences last year and the speaker was vehemently opposed. His contention was that increasing the block size would make the blockchain too large (in gigabytes) for the average node to hold, which would lead to fewer full nodes and greater centralization.
My own opinion is that we need to increase the block size (when the time comes) while looking for better long-term solutions. But there seems to be a vocal minority which pushes for no size changes at all--presumably in an attempt to hold development hostage until THEIR scalability solutions are accepted. (The gentleman I speak of was suggesting many "micro-nodes" rather than fewer full nodes.)
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:57:32
OK, we'll say there are a MILLION MILLION (one trillion) possible "acceptable" addresses. Now it would only take 164,917,440,207 years. You just can't argue with math.

I agree, it is sad.

For what it's worth, when I got into bitcoins back in December, one of the first things I learned was not to deal with Mt. Gox. A very limited amount of research led me to three glaring problems: fiat withdrawals being held up for months, major hack which cost them millions, and U.S. seizure of $5 million in funds.
The second thing I learned, after learning not to trust Mt. Gox, was how to use cold storage.

I'm curious as to why one cryptocurrency would not be considered a "like kind exchange" if converted to a different cryptocurrency. Consider for instance a BTC/LTC exchange. The two are essentially identical, other than LTC having faster block times. Can you elaborate on this?
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:21:43
When you burned your BTC, you automatically received a certain amount of XCP in proportion to how much you burned. Consequently, it allowed them to distribute their currency to people with a vested interest in its success, without people accusing them of being scammers (since the money is destroyed in the process).

You have to read that in context. Later he says:
"The proposed BitLicense will have a potentially counterintuitive effect since the leaders in bitcoin — those with professional management teams dedicated to security and compliance — will not be able to operate in New York.  New Yorkers will continue to use bitcoin but will be forced to use providers that operate outside the current legitimized and professionalized cohort.  The provision of services simply will not be up to the standards that we aim to provide, and New York consumers will suffer the consequences."
It's not that he's saying "trust us" per se. It's that he's saying if you MUST trust someone, it should be a business leader and not a potentially shady shop on the street corner.
Granted, the requirement to trust anyone is antithetical to the core beliefs of bitcoin. I think his argument, however, is that trusting an established player is "less bad" than trusting some random person or entity.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:53:13

I see your point for sure. Traders, for sure, got hammered. Investors, on the other hand, will be fine (in my opinion). I was one who bought with bitcoin, which means that my investment is nominally worth about half of what I paid, at this particular moment. But I'm not really too worried, because I invested in the technology, not in a quick buck. Since I wasn't planning on selling any time soon, I haven't actually lost anything.

The issue is not whether you will attack the network. The issue is the fact that such massive amounts of mining power are centralized in your pool. Do you not understand that decentralization was the underlying concept of Bitcoin? At a certain point, you become a danger to the ecosystem just by existing.

I don't think so. Occam's razor doesn't take into account irrational people (and CW definitely seems eccentric). I'm also not finding it hard to believe that Satoshi would want to introduce his presence gradually, rather than watching the price drop by an insane amount.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:23:04
Reread it. He's saying he believes.
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:01:46
If you were Satoshi and had half a billion dollars in assets, but knew that touching them would make their price drop by 80-90%, what would you do? You would almost have to reveal yourself publicly, if for no other reason than to reassure the community that you aren't going to sell everything all at once.
I think I would gradually introduce myself to the world in much the same way CW has...
I would make a case based on circumstantial evidence that, upon further examination, doesn't appear too reliable. But at least it gets people thinking that maybe, just maybe, Satoshi is still alive and could theoretically move his coins. Among my circumstantial evidence would be a trust agreement showing that I can't move the coins until 2020, so that people don't freak out if for some reason they do believe me.
Then I would meet privately with some trusted community members and get their imprimatur, then post some shady shit on my blog. Gets people thinking even harder, but the rest of the community still doesn't believe.
Then I would move a coin from an early block which can't definitively be linked to Satoshi. More people would believe me, but the majority would still say "somebody else probably mined that one."
Then maybe I'd get different trusted developers to come for a private meeting, and sign something with Genesis but forbid them from releasing the signature...like CW did with Gavin for Block 1.
Then I'd just keep going until eventually I proved myself publicly and announced that my coins are locked down for the next four years, and that even after that I will only be able to spend X coins per year.
