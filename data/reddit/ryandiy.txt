Just like Kenya did with M-Pesa.  It's a digital payment system which has taken over the country and is often preferred by merchants over cash.

I agree with this analysis after watching other men getting wrecked by bad marriages and worse divorces.  They are the truly sad ones.   
I've heard countless men confide in me how unhappy they are being married.  But I've never heard a single one talk about how great it is, unless they are in the first 5 years.  They all moan about losing their freedom and barely having a sex life anymore.
And the men who get divorced go through emotional torture and financial devastation.  I've seen it happen with my own eyes. Including my deceased brother, who would probably be alive today if he didn't have his life ruined by a vicious ex wife.
Screw all that.  I'm not signing a marriage contract.  It's a shitty, dangerous deal to make.

Great for them!
How much of their happiness has resulted from the act of signing the marriage contract? 
And how much from every other part of the relationship?
 
I wouldn't be surprised if it's a 1% vs 99% split.

Yeah I suppose that may have happened once or twice.

For some reason this argument isn't very effective on women when you're unemployed and trying to date them.

Yeah, if you're not mortgaging your house to buy more bitcoin, you're a fool!  /s

Women almost always marry men who have more money than they do.  It's a phenomenon known as "hypergamy" and is a deeply ingrained, evolved behavior that we can observe across cultures.
And a related phenomenon we see is that when the husband becomes sick, unemployed, or experiences other serious trouble, the women typically start shopping for another man immediately and the marriage ends.  And then the ex husband often gets to pay for her to live in his former house with her new boyfriend.  In some cases, his alimony is calculated based on his potential (former) earnings rather than his current low earnings.
I've seen this play out in the lives of men around me.  Marriage is a terrible deal for men, with huge downsides and very few upsides you can't get by staying unmarried.   It is the single worst decision that many men will make in their lifetime.

I can't think of any better way to spend 1.5 billion.

Are you one of those who think that this word exists?
