The majority of the population hasn't invested in bitcoin yet. Many of them see it as a missed opportunity, and they want to see it die so that their mistake of not purchasing it suddenly turns into a good choice. So they search for things that confirm what they desire to see.
However, they're finding out that it isn't dead. And they are starting to worry, what if bitcoin reaches $10k? $100k? How much will they regret the mistake then? Especially now that they can buy in so easily...

@_date: 2014-03-17 18:39:38
I hate greedy ass-hats as much as anyone else, but all they said was "It is not guaranteed that bitcoin would preserve the commission at such fairly low levels".
I would agree with that - and I'd go even further to point out that we actually don't have low fees right now. We're paying for the mining network by having the currency inflate - giving 25BTC (roughly $16000!) to the miners every 10 minutes. This effectively takes money from *all bitcoin holders*, not just the ones doing the transactions, in order to allow the transactions to take place. The cost per transaction (roughly $44) is probably somewhere between 1% and 5%, depending on how you estimate "real" transaction volume.
Once the block rewards drop to small amounts, it doesn't seem really clear to me that the mining network can still be secure. If enough of the network stops mining because it's not profitable, the risk of attack will be higher.
If this is a problem, it isn't all doom and gloom - we can change the protocol and not let the mining rewards drop too far. If it's not a problem, then it doesn't really matter, and perhaps these costs can decrease significantly. But the end isn't really clear to me.

Your calculation of cost is from the perspective of a miner. And I am pretty sure the cost, to miners, approaches ( block_reward * chance_of_winning_block ) as a result of competition. But that's irrelevant.
But because we were talking about transaction costs, you have to consider things from the perspective of the users, not the miners. Whatever is rewarded to the miners on top of transaction fees is an inflationary cost to bitcoin holders.

I only have a little remorse for people who lost their coins on Mt.Gox. Everyone knows bitcoin is not regulated, and using services that are based on it comes with a certain amount of known risk.
I do think could have done newer people a great service by not banning Mt.Gox complaints, because seeing this would have provided them the much-needed warning not to use the service.
That said, all services are dangerous. Keep the majority of your coins in cold storage, and only a small amount on 3rd party sites, and you'll be fine.

It's fine for now, but it is definitely not the safe thing to do for the long term. Eventually, mining will become a smaller portion of total investment in bitcoin, because of mining reward halving, while the value of bitcoin is likely to rise.
Suppose, for argument's sake, that 5-10 years from now bitcoin reaches a $10 trillion market cap, and the two largest mining pools, combined, are worth only $100 million to their investors. It is possible, through short-selling and other methods, that these two pools could conspire to net more money from a total crash of the currency than they would lose from their mining investments.
The incentives, at least over the long term, are *not aligned.*

You have to put a chance on it happening. If you consider that chance to be 100% that it reaches $150k, then you should do like you suggest - 20 hour days and putting all your money in it.
But none of us are putting 100% chance on these things. It's impossible to tell the future, and there are many things that could go wrong. So you put a realistic chance on it - say a 25% chance it reaches $150k.
This still makes it worth putting a lot of money into it. It's a gamble with a very high "expected value". But you shouldn't put all of your money in it, because you measure your outcomes in terms of happiness - not in terms of expected value. Losing all your money is a really bad outcome for happiness, probably enough to counterbalance any positive outcome, and that's why we try to distribute risk.

Our measures of inflation are horribly inaccurate. It's based on a basket of goods that has, over time, gotten cheaper and easier to produce as a result of technological advances.
Profitable companies don't get cheaper and easier to produce. A better measure of inflation is to just look at the total value of the stock market. The value of the S&amp;P is a far more accurate representation of true inflation. If you go by this, the value of gold has actually dropped significantly.

Bank of America didn't patent this, but a bank or government could, in theory, issue "fiatcoin".
They would provide the starting mining network, and let any additional miners help support the network by collecting transaction fees. There would be a special public and private key in the protocol, which the government (or bank) owns, which allows them to send fiatcoins to any address.
They make a public announcement. You can buy as many fiatcoins as you want from the bank for $1 each. They will buy your fiatcoins from you, for $1 each.
This will be how dollars turn into a cryptocurrency. Once this happens, I worry about what will come of Bitcoin.

The protocol absolutely relies on the value of Bitcoin as an asset.

Well, I have no problem with these folks. You can probably take a guess as to why

Let me preface this by saying I don't hate them at all, and they're probably alright. But in all the pictures I've seen, they look like *such douchebags*.

They are outlawing pricing and selling any goods in BTC. But I *think* they're saying it's legal to use it as a transaction medium that causes Yuan to go from one person to another.

If the mining community can agree to it, we can just treat greenlisted coins as blacklisted coins.
You want to greenlist coins? Fine, since that's public information, we don't have to process transactions on your coins...

Except if you're caught doing this by PayPal (or any other payment service), they'll ban you.

Seems like a pointless novelty. If you want to get data from one place to another without getting discovered in between, you could easily encrypt it (memorize a passphrase), send it to some online storage system, and go to your target location, retrieve it, and decrypt it with your passphrase.

Given several assumptions, certain things do have an intrinsic value. For instance, if you assume that precious metals must necessarily be used in catalytic converters, and you assume a certain demand for catalytic converters, you can ignore all speculative value and the precious metals will still have a measurable "intrinsic value" based on how much it costs to obtain them - a price that they can't really go below.
Bitcoin may also have similar kinds of "intrinsic value" based on certain assumptions.

Unfortunately, lots of people have the (stupid) misconception that it's impossible to modify the bitcoin protocol. And that we'll just let the system collapse if we notice problems in the future.

The Twinklebros are making an ETF for it. Are you even reading the front page? I don't believe there's any other way until they finish that.

It depends on who is accepting the money and what the amount is for. If it's a small amount (under $25 or so?) they can do a zero-confirmation transaction and not wait for blocks to get mined.
Zero-confirmation transactions for brick-and-mortar shops for low amounts of money are *kind of* safe because it's a hassle to try to do a double-spend.
For large amounts and for websites that are rife with people trying to cheat them (e.g. poker sites), they will want to be sure the money was confirmed by the blockchain. This makes double-spending nearly impossible, but takes a while...
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:26:52
That's kind of shit, though, because people who sit on a lump of investments would get taxed less than someone who is actually providing a service by doing work
I mean, I even have bitcoins, but I'd rather have a system where my capital gains are taxed and my work isn't.

Wow. Really? This dude has a huge lack of understanding of how disruptive new technologies are.
E-mail (and other Internet shit) has completely destroyed the Postal Service as far as letters were concerned. The postal service is still useful - but only as a package shipment service. I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon accounted for over than half the revenue of shipping services.
Books and magazines in print form are so fucking dead it's ridiculous. Just look at Barnes &amp; Noble's stock price since the 2008 crash. People still read - but it's now done through Amazon, iOS/android etc. more often than in print.

This is a common misconception. The reason this won't do much is because you can't add security to a transaction by having shorter blocks; you only add security by allowing it to take longer.
An average of 1-second transaction provides additional *granularity* to how long you're willing to wait, but doesn't provide faster security of a transaction. You'll still see all the sites waiting 30+ minutes for transactions to get confirmed.

I'm only guessing, by Google Translate of this phrase: "payment institutions are not allowed to Bitcoin price for the product or service"
That really sounds like it's against the law to price things in Bitcoin.

As long as the network is well-connected, and you use a well-connected node, it's pretty difficult to perform race attacks. Problems really only occur when the network becomes less well-connected due to bad Internet connections, routing problems, etc. 
It really depends on what your product is, and you should decide based on your own cost/benefit analysis whether or not to use 0-confirmation transactions. You could put some safeguards in place (limit the quantity/number of purchases per IP, etc.) to limit your risk.

No, they can double-spend in multi-confirmation transactions, by spending on the "real" blockchain, while creating an independent blockchain that they publish to the network at a later date, replacing the original.

The mining network allows you to use "fiatcoin" without having to trust the bank, once you purchase your coins. It's just that as long as the bank exists and uses its special power, they can keep the value of the coins pegged to USD.
It's effectively no different from the trust people place in cash dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:19:05
Not entirely true. At any given point, bitcoin is potentially susceptible to the following economic problem:
1. How much will it cost to create a system capable of beating the rest of the mining network (and generating a 51% attack)?
2. Do I make more money by performing the 51% attack, and short-selling the entirety of the currency than I would lose from building the 51% attack network?
The bitcoin network is secure only if the answer to question  is "No."

However, if someone steals them from you, I would expect you to be allowed to sue to get them back.

Absolutely not! Right now we have $3-4 million USD per day going to the miners. Their electricity costs are probably about half of that. If the rewards dropped down to $100k, you'd see them shutting down the vast majority of their equipment.

If you're using the trollbox, you are a troll, and you're trying to do one of the following:
1) scare the other trolls into selling the currency you want so you can buy it cheap
2) get the other trolls to buy the currency you just invested in so you can sell it higher

I've *never* had this problem. I've always been able to simply call my banks and/or credit card companies to waive fees when I didn't feel I deserved them, and they've always been happy to accommodate me. This has happened many, many times.
I can't wait for bitcoin to go mainstream either, but I suspect you're in the wrong here or you're just lying.

At least Coinbase probably won't take your money and run, because they're backed by high-profile investors. Other sites - who knows what they'll do? If they want to take your money and run, they're going to claim they got hacked.

Actually I kind of agree with you. I wouldn't scam anyone else, but it should be thought of like cash. If you aren't careful with your cash, you should fully expect it to disappear...

Well, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has an average yearly income of roughly $300/person... and in some of its places, probably as low as $50-100/person. That could be as low as 25 cents per day, so a half penny transaction would be proportionally similar to a $2-$3 transaction for a well-to-do American.

Bitcoins can (and I believe will) still replace gold without needing to be a super-convenient way to go Christmas shopping. Simply because it's a pain in the ass to deal with gold.

That, and he's pretending to ignore how the U.S. Dollar is in the same boat as Bitcoin as far as "intrinsic value" is concerned.
Well, you can use it as toilet paper, so I guess it does have intrinsic value. You can't wipe your ass with a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:09:20
Well, there might be some sites that would like to choose something in between, and they can do this because of the additional granularity in a 1-second block system, but it's not going to change how the current gambling/exchange sites work (with nearly unlimited deposits/cashouts) because it doesn't provide additional security.
The only sites/services that can accept zero confirmations are the ones offering products for a few dollars or less.

You don't really even need that, since you can do two-party escrow with Bitcoin.

Many of us who have thought about it for a considerable amount of time truly believe there's a high likelihood that bitcoins will reach $100k-$1m over the next 5-10 years. The volatility will stop when those of us who are going long are finally willing to sell their coins. Until then, the exchanges will be full of fickle, skittish day traders who don't even know how bitcoins work or what their eventual value will be.
