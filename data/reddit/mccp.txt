let me make sure i understand.
Take the example where i plan to spend $100 at store A over the next period of time P, we open a multisig address for $200 with that store with an opening transaction signed for $100 for store A and $100 for me.
You are implying that Store A can re-use that same $100 stake for customer B? or that I can use my $100 stake for Store B? 
because that's just wrong. Channels are 1-1. Chaining utilizes multiple 1-1 hops of stake between users. If customer B uses my channel to Store A, I am nolonger able to spend the $100 i planned to for that period of time P and need to open a new channel. It's the same $100, and you don't get to magically copy it infinite times.

If a coffee shop has to stake roughly twice its monthly revenue in order to support LN, on paper it will never scale so they have no incentive to adopt.
If merchants don't support it then users won't lock their funds up for it

There have been hundreds of blocks over 1MB
To have reliable 0-conf and 1-conf fast transactions, Bitcoin needed to have the block larger otherwise it would have a backlog like BTC. Even if it would have cleared in less than an hour with a 1MB cap, there is no reason to damage the speed and utility like that.

This is sort of like saying that the ford model T can't possibly scale to transport every human on the planet.
The space has changed since we lost Hal. There is a marketplace of competitive coins with different features and applications.
To assume that any one of them will scale to encompass the use-cases better suited to existing specialized coins is missing the broader picture. To assume that BTC will be the one to do that is ludicrous. 
We no longer have the luxury of utopian idealism where bitcoin is the only coin. Perhaps if it had kept up with demand at the right time, it wouldn't be 33% and dropping and it would be still theoretically possible. The cat is out of the bag at this point, though.

i don't think your last point is real.
exchanges profit from off-chain trades, not at all related to mining or fees. they are incentivized to have low fees to have a better user experience, but that's about it. they make their money either way.

If I paid you money to eat spam would it be spam? Of course. That's a nonsense question.
Do you think fees imposed by email service providers reduce the spam rate substantially even at &lt;1 cent per email? What matters is how much they expect to make off of the send. For Bitcoin transactions, that value is zero, unless you can fill up a gigabyte of blocks at which point you will have succeeded at increasing the tx fee to 2 cents instead of 1. That probably wouldn't even spook markets though, because it would be showing off the relative spam resistance.

You're asking how fees discourage usage?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:49:47
If you gave away 1 sat/B to miners, it will cost you $50k per day. Nothing will change, fees for normal users will remain under 1 cent per tx, and the chain will look resilient by comparison.
If you want to spam such that it costs $1 per tx, it will cost you $8.7M per day, and it will more than double the BCH block reward, which will spike it to 20%+ of hash power, and slow down BTC transactions even more, while still maintaining tx fees an order of magnitude lower.
In both examples, i believe the "attack" would benefit. In your imagination, what amount of spending begins to "damage the currency" and via what mechanism?
Let me also address your email comparison, by saying if you charged $20 for placement in your inbox, would most of the mail you stopped be spam, or would it be legitimate mail? This is obviously a terrible comparison to use for your argument.

The LN node has access to the funds that are transferred to your recipient.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:06:39
Sorry, i'm trying my best to explain the difference between paying on behalf of someone and paying directly. I'm clearly not doing a very good job.


No reason to keep trying to paint emotions on me.
Let me try to explain the difference with an example: With bitcoin transactions, there is no way that I would accidentally have a transaction where I gave $1,000,000 to ISIS.
With LN, if I set up a node, there could exist a transaction on the bitcoin ledger from my address to an ISIS address.
There are volumes of law written to prevent systems from allowing these kinds of transactions from taking place accidentally. It is those laws which apply in this situation but not to miners.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:59:13
Bitcoin is extremely inefficient. The validation loop is single threaded. Nothing is memoized from the mempool. There are dozens more and I would invite you to see BU's presentation at scaling Bitcoin this year if you don't believe me.
 Hash rate follows difficulty induced profitability. Non-hashing node count follows the number of people confused about thin clients in a trustless network.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:44:09
That's covered by redundant
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:50:54
... so when I buy coffee using a LN node, I send a LN token to the LN node, which also sends a LN token to the coffee shop. 
That is a transfer of funds from the LN node to the recipient.
The resolution of LN tokens for bitcoins are totally separate transactions which can happen at different times with different values.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:42
Would have been a great time to explain the liquidity problem (which is more serious than the fees themselves) and the nuances of where LN can and cannot help.
Instead it sounded like memorized garbage mouth
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:31:29
ok. 1.7x, 2x, sounds too slow to me still.
the second link explains with a 30-day settlement window, you're limited to 20 million users transacting per month. That is 1.6x our current monthly transaction rate.
Any number of "aggregation of payments" is moot if it does not in the end resolve to an individual user's wallet. Some hypothetical scenario where everyone perpetually leaves their coins in LN pools is actually masses of people using off-chain transactions; a hypothetical scenario where people are not using the Blockchain at all is the ideal path forward for bitcoin? and that's worth crippling growth for a year or more? And everyone will be willing to pay for tax preparers to handle all the procedurally generated LN transactions? No one will use it for money laundering, making it a regulatory target for all users?
And again, these unsuitable metrics are themselves under ideal circumstances which will never exist.

No... sorry i must be very unclear i don't think you ever correctly understand what I am trying to say.
LN node operators send their bitcoins to arbitrary parties to operate as a clearing house. Because they are transferring their own coins, they are legally liable for where they end up, and also liable for maintaining records and filings satisfactory to prove that they could not be utilized as terrorist funder.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:38:23
One difference between a Bitcoin transaction and a LN transaction is that in a bitcoin transaction, funds are not sent "on behalf of" anyone. The miner has no access to your funds. 
You are paying a miner for the service of producing valid work. You are paying your recipient for goods or services. Those are both clear taxable events.
Automated Clearing Houses have, among other regulatory burdens, the burden of verifying the identity of the recipient. 
However, whatever opinion you or I have of what the law is, it does not matter. The legality does not in fact exist until there has been settled litigation on the matter.

Bitcoin cash is suddenly popular because Bitcoin was at both an unprecedented high value and in an unprecedented state of unusability. It's simple fundamentals, not some memes and tv talking heads. The difficulty adjusts every two weeks. It's virtually impossible to do anything which isn't in the week before an adjustment or the week after.
How is the core team less centralized than a consortium of ABC, unlimited, electron, etc who work on and purpose different features? I honestly don't see anything similar going on in core.

What rules? validating transactions that have to be validated before being accepted into a block anyway? Transactions are not useful at all anymore until they are in a block (due to RBF), so even if you ask a "user node" if a transaction is valid, that is meaningless until it has been confirmed.
What attack vector would there be with 100 mining nodes that would not apply to 100 mining nodes and 900 "user nodes"?

I disagree about the number of bitcoin users, but that doesn't matter because bitcoin should be built to handle where we will be in 6 months, not 12 months behind.
Coinbase has 13 million users. That's only americans, and that's one exchange. There are 4 larger. 
The goal is for them to be able to use bitcoin as a currency. The fact that they are currently priced out of being able to due so by $6.23 average fees
 does not mean there is not demand for use of bitcoin as a currency.
If they use bitcoin and LN as a currency, as you're describing, only 20M will be able to while settling to the blockchain only once per month, which is an incredibly idealistic scenario. In reality, it will be fewer.
Not every currency involves automatic transferring funds on behalf of another unknown party for an unknown purpose. In fact, none do.

@_date: 2017-12-05 22:51:13
No, my point is more extreme than that. 
The act of using LN in itself is arguably money laundering. Conveying currency on behalf of an unknown party for an unknown purpose is itself a crime, even if that person turns out to be grandma sending grandson $5 for his birthday. The conveyance is the crime, regardless of the criminality of the money transfer purpose, though especially so if you end up being a node for an otherwise illegal transaction, which you would have no way to avoid
If you're curious what I'm talking about I would start with page 26 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:42
Can you please stick to the subject. 
You think that taxes will be just as simple with a LN tx as a bitcoin tx? So a node operator, who pays $100 worth of btc, then later receives $120 worth of btc when the transaction settles and bitcoin has increased in value, will not owe taxes on that $20 appreciation? Or he will owe taxes as if the coins he spent never left his portfolio, which can be deferred until sale?
That is one of the simpler complexities introduced, but do you have an opinion on that one? Is your opinion shared by the only party that matters (the IRS)?
There is no evidence at all about how these will be treated by law. An accepted tax return would be a bare minimum proof-of-concept. Wanting to see one should be a basic sanity check if you wanted to partake in these types of transactions.

So, just to make sure I understand what you're saying:
if the "attack" succeeded, the network would be able to handle the current transaction demand, but because full nodes would need to spend 4 extra seconds propagating blocks, and store an extra 550MB of unpruned block data, bitcoin would be worse off?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:30:36

What you are describing is the way Bitcoin works with or without "user nodes"
If miners fork the chain, it doesn't matter what users say. They are forced to use whatever chain is the longest and is functional or leave with a bag.
This is a fundamental aspect of bitcoin's design, for which I'll refer you to the whitepaper instead of continuing this.

regarding technical solution backed by real science: 8MB blocks propagate nearly as quickly as a 4MB block + data. There's really only marginal comparison there, less than 1% of a 10 minute block time. 
Also technical: BCH is addressing block propagation time with mempool preconfirmation memoization.

Every time a transaction happens, there is something called "witness data" which is a signature from the sender which proves the transaction is valid. 
If you are doing a "SegWit" transaction, that data is stored outside of the blockchain, and can be deleted later to save space.
You can still use the witness data verify the transaction 100%.
The downsides are that: for a 1MB block, you end up needing to transmit 4MB of data, so from a bandwidth perspective it's a net negative. Also, each block contains a "hash" of the previous block, which is basically a proof that it was mined afterwards. Because the signature is not included in the block, it does not become an input to that hash function. There is no known way where this is a security problem, since the signature has to be valid anyway... but kind of like endorsing a paper check, even though it doesn't provide any actual security... it's kind of weird to ask people specifically to *not endorse checks*

I think you would struggle to find bitcoin "users" but as a former user, and current crypocurrency user, I can say I don't want well regulated exchanges. I want the need for exchanges to be minimized. As the value of coins goes up, we should become less and less dependent upon fiat conversion for value and instead rely upon the intrinsic value of our own currency.
Instead, it seems like bitcoin is becoming a thing which is unusable outside of exchanges, and they are becoming a monopoly on value transfer.

Fully utilized Segwit is about a 1.5x capacity increase.
Fully utilized LightningNetwork is of indeterminate benefit, and could even be a detriment (  ) but it's maximum ideal benefit is about 1.6x (  )
It is obvious these are insufficient without an accompanying block size increase. There's no excuse for leaving the limit where it is for all these years.
LN also steps all over existing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in many jurisdictions, especially the US. (In addition to making taxes even more complex)
I have no problem with experimenting with payment channels. I have only mild problem with experimenting with payment channels on the bitcoin chain. The problem I have is they are not a surrogate for actual transaction scaling, which is desperately needed if bitcoin is going to maintain its advantage over usable cryptocurrencies.

If OP's theory were correct, the miners would still be working on the BTC chain. 
The difficulty adjustment is currently scheduled to go DOWN, and they would be mining BTC so that the retarget would be UP.

Not sure what your argument is on malleability, since it seems to either undercut segwit or be an attack on copy+paste? even copy+paste with modifications, feedback, and resulting in a separate competing implementation
It's the 2 hard forks this year that I'm referring to with "things are at least getting done." My opinion is that bitcoin can't survive without at least 1 hard fork (to increase capacity).
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:38:05
Correct. It is only for v3 transactions. So if you have dependent transactions you can use v3 to avoid malleability.

What you're missing is that each and every little jagged edge is what matters, not the bigger picture. 
If you want to be included in the /next block/, e.g. you want to make a meaningful and timely transaction, as is needed for commerce, you have to compete with what people are paying at the high end, not pay the minimum that /could/ be included. You are aiming at certainty, Otherwise, there's a possibility that you won't make it into the /absolute next/ block, at which point the mempool picture could change and leave your tx in limbo for weeks.

Dunno about BTH developers, but BCH devs implemented an independent malleability fix, an EDA which is keeping both chains stable, and are implementing address namespacing to prevent accidental cross-chain spending.
And regarding "will eventually stop working," BU tested gigabyte blocks and CSW provisioned hardware to test even bigger blocks to support 1700x current transactions.
Can you tell me what volume LN has tested at with ideal channel topography and resolving to 1MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:10:43
there is no evidence that LN is safe and sane, in fact it opens a whole can of Anti-Money-Laundering laws, while there are multiple chains of empirical evidence that bigger blocks are sane. Also even in an ideal state with 1-month channels and 100% LN, you're talking about 0.2% of visa with the current block size.

mempool is filling up. could trigger a feedback loop with people trying to exit, making the network look worse, causing more people to want to exit. Prototypical run.
There could also be feedback with profitability parity (1.09x) and 25% of hashrate (9.4 vs 3.04) on the other chain right now slowing down block rate even more.

For the past ~24 hrs it has been 1x-3x as profitable to mine the 8mb chain. In 128 blocks, the bch chain will adjust difficulty by a few hundred percent. Tomorrow, the difficulty adjustment algorithm will be changed by a hardfork to avoid the wild swings that have characterized difficulty since the fork.
These movements in BCH price have given it &gt;50% hash power, which has slowed the BTC chain mining down to sometimes hours between blocks, which has in-turn caused the already busy mempool to become backed up with higher fee transactions. 
If all things stay the same, the BTC chain will regain its higher profitability rate and miners will likely return later today, though entering the week with ATH pending fees.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:46:37
See this 11k per second JavaScript implementation of ecdsa verification on secp256k1 curve:
Also keep in mind these could also be pre-verified during mempool insertion, and further, you can mine on the headers before receiving or validation the full block.

we haven't seen a panic like Gox since Gox. It's really hard to say what the crash or recovery would look like.
If we get a mempool/hashrate that looks like 11/12, the panic won't be confined to tether exchanges. I think the "haven" will be exchanges which are still providing consistent USD withdrawal and cryptos which still have instantaneous transfers.

I think they got it right on the EDA to be honest. 
If it had started with the current EDA algorithm, the chain would have likely died in August. It needed the big forced difficulty drops back then.
Yea, copy+paste has hazards, i get that, I've been a professional programmer for 14 years. FlexTrans reuses lots of code and even comments (it is always a good idea to preserve comments.. not sure why that needs pointing out). A lot of BCH don't like it, and have iterated to another implementation (  ) which has more support but still not enough to merge. No pasta there, right?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:48:30
There is a yellow band of transactions paying 600-700 and not getting included in the /next block/. That is _underpaying_ if you desire to have your tx included in the /next block./
if you aren't getting in the /next block/ you are submitting yourself to an unknowable delay time, as the mempool situation changes after each and every block.
I suppose the OP is suggesting some kind of prisoner's dilemma solution where if everyone agreed to cap at 500, the same tx could get included and everyone would pay less.. but that's not how adversarial game theory works.
TLDR: if you want to avoid /unknowable delay/ you have to compete with the people paying the most, not guess at a minimal average.

My point was that "shit you can't afford" is not up to you, and can be rapidly pulled out from under you. In your hypothetical worst case scenario of being stuck with a mortgage and McD's employment:
$8.67 * 262 * 8 = $18,172
remove 6.2% for social security withholding = $17,045
You save 84% off your healthcare mandate, so you only have to pay $738, bringing your take-home to = $16,307
You own your own car and it's electric, so you don't need to buy transit or make car payments or buy fuel, but insurance takes you down $1,297(natl avg) and repairs take another $1,186(natl avg new), leaving you $13,824.
Your house has a crazy grandfathered property tax rate of $800 and your (natl avg) $1,083 home insurance mandated by your mortgage leaves you $11,941.
You only do absolutely necessary repairs and spend $1,000 per year on home repairs, so you have $10,941.
You have only $50/mo in bills total, down to $10,341.
So after everything you're required to pay to satisfy legal obligations, you've got $861/mo to do anything other than your terrible job. And you're going to give how much of that to a banker for an underwater asset?
In my opinion, owning liquid assets more valuable than your debt is reckless and optimistic. Doing so when some numbers inside a computer outside of your control can force you to sleep outside is foolish.

@_date: 2017-11-23 17:56:31
1) validation time is equal for every participant (only varies by comparative CPU speed), so it gets washed out by difficulty adjustment. It is also a small fraction of network lag to begin with.
2) 550 block pruning
Additionally, like every aspect of Bitcoin, propagation is eligible for enhancement if you're not afraid of silverware. Miners already have the set of transactions in memory, so propagation can exist on a metadata layer as in this proposal: 
Also: miners today already hash on the block headers until they have a full block to work on.

In my opinion, that is up to the miners. Blocks have been generating so fast they have a lot built up bch, maybe even enough to make the market. They could dump or hold, both could arguably be in their profit interests. 
I wouldn't count on the bch market to correct quickly without some kind of catalyzing event. Many of the buyers (like me) have been frustrated for years and feel relief. Coming from 600% growth there's not much to lose
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:46:42
It will when it kicks in on BCH presently. For BTC, it will likely not make enough blocks to adjust down if it's on 25% power
 20 days estimated before a modest adjustment at the current rate (which will change with impending BCH adjustment), but that adjustment won't bail it out into a serviceable 25% power chain like an EDA would.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:06:05
Visa averages 150,000,000 tx/day which is 1736 tx/sec
So an average 10min block would need to contain 1,041,600 transactions.
The last BCH block with transactions in it was 273kB for 910 outputs. 
(273kB / 910) * 1,041,600 = 312 MB.
Using your 100Mbps connection, that is an ideal propagation time of 25 seconds. On a gigabit connection you would get in a data center, where miners are, that is 2.5 seconds
So: If we scale BCH to Visa level without accounting for any improvement in connections by that time, then basement miners would have a 3.5% disadvantage against datacenter miners. Hardly a decentralization doomsday.

Unfortunately, the story doesn't end there. If the same thing occurs here if exchanges struggle to meet demands and implement controls, I would expect a similar artificial ATH followed by a similar 2-year crash/recovery.

Block rewards are enough without the need for tx fees. We are not facing an existential hashpower problem. Tx fees should be optional incentive. If miners don't see a reason to include 0sat tx, they are free to ignore them. If people want to try spamming the network paying $0.01 per tx, they can do that with or without a block size limit. In fact, the block limit in some ways enables that type of attack by leaving all of the money spent on spam unconfirmed.

Lol ok but please feel free to make a point.

Satoshi is clearly on top. Sub $1 buyers, then sub $10, etc.
It is literally the late investors money making the early investors disproportionately richer. That is textbook pyramid.
Crazy how explaining something so obvious gets DV in this sub.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:55:21
Oh you want an argument? I'm still waiting for a reason why everyone needs a full node.
How about the mempool hasn't emptied in 4 days.
How about even if 100% optimized the LN and a 1MB block will max out at 20 million users per month.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:52:49
Virtually everyone in this sub. Most big blockers see it as a harmless concession to make in the context of a block size increase. No big blocker ever thought segwit was sufficient for scaling the chain to meet current transaction needs, let alone future.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:48:21
Can you please skip to the part where you explain how user nodes secure the network?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:49:06
Oh ok, well if you say so.

51% of "marketcap"
That means, if every bitcoin was for sale at today's price, the total in USD would be more than the equivalent cap of all the other crypto combined.
The statistic is misleading because it ignores how many bitcoins are lost forever, which is a significantly higher ratio than other crypto.
the "attack" part is an attempted joke based upon the name "51%" (a 51% attack is a category of attack which can hijack the blockchain if a nefarious pool gains 51% of hash power). It's totally unrelated to the marketshare, which is purely trivia. It's like if someone saw the word "replay" on netflix and decided it was a joke about "replay attacks" to just say the word "replay"

This doomsday scenario you imagined hasn't happened from the Aug 1st fork or from forks in other currencies. Those didn't have "years in advance" or even "months"
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:20:28
yea my approach would be to touch as little data as possible, just mounting it as an external volume instead of booting to it. I mean there's only a handful of places i would put a wallet.dat, and i know them heuristically better than any search algorithm could. At the very least i'd start with this approach, and get more aggressive as i went. 
If I lost my wallet in a minefield, my first step wouldn't be to do an arm-linked grid search, but carefully retrace my footsteps.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:41:38


So you're saying these failed miserably despite their "hype node count"
So yes, I still believe "hype node count" doesn't matter... and I appreciate you providing examples of why.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:39:38
A variety of community problems. Not a plurality of user nodes.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:48:15


So, would you say this sub has a "firm direction (and) belief"?
Glad we can agree.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:41:46
in fairness, it's only mostly pointless. Gold has flaws too, and arguably bitcoin's flaws could be preferable to gold's flaws.
Still, i miss when bitcoin was strictly better than all currencies and assets.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:01:22
Yeah but premine are capable of being sold by their owners. Satoshi coins are like 5% alone, I've seen zombie coin estimates around 40%.

Ok, but how will you convince Luke to merge it? This week he said even 1MB was harmful
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:12:43
Your audio second​-hand (hearsay) quote​: "jihan has told me himself that all he wants to do is get rid of those people" says nothing about HK/NYA/2MB, and in fact the quote you attributed to him came from the speaker.
Secondly, it's a glaring fallacy to claim that all 95% of miner signals have the same motivation as your made up quote.
Again, via wanting to get rid of core does not imply in any way that is the reason they want a reasonable block size.
You've got the chronology wrong. BS signed the HK agreement for 2MB, and it was their later backing out which drew the hostility.
2MB is not a hostile proposal:

User nodes do nothing to prevent forks. It's miners who get a vote.

Those words are only confusing in the context of a false dilemma. He even put quotes on it to show that such a position would be absurd, if it were real. 
He is saying he doesn't "support killing people," but someone should probably kill that guy with an assault rifle in the kindergarten.

You can just give him a paper wallet with private key...
That way you can avoid paying 100% service fee for your tip as you wait for LN.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:04:08
cool word. have a justification for it?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:14:14
oh ha!
i didn't read all the steps, yea the dd would make it crash if it ever was going to.

Jesus listen to yourself

conv=noerror will not prevent a head crash cascade. It will just make it continue the scan as normal instead of exiting when it detects a fault. In fact, that flag might cause a cascading head crash where an early exit would have saved it.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:13:14
5% hashrate without EDA makes it unusably slow. It's hard to call it a currency at ~12.5k transactions per day. Hours of trades being prioritized by whoever's pool happened to mine the last block sounds like a panic run to me. If a pool mines 3 blocks in a row, they get to decide 10 hours worth of transactions.
A hard-fork is unavoidable.

who sells food for 0conf bitcoin transactions? need to get me some free food
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:45:50
it was actually sarcasm about the mempool
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:49:04
e.g. there's a speck on the platter or the surface has been impacted in the sector of your ~/porn directory, dd will run into that speck and cascade the failure. 
mount will not care about random bytes in /home/porn. ls won't look at the data, just the filesystem metadata.
Having been in a race to rescue data on a failing disk before, you really want to do as little as possible as fast as possible. Once the failure cascade has begun, there's no going back.
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:40:35
Can you explain the difference then? 
The source is very straightforward:
this is just doubling MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE and providing the appropriate signalling.
BIP103 would put us at 1.04X today, not 2X today. It would take 5 years to get there at 17% scaling annually. But that doesn't matter, since BS is not increasing the size, it is an extraneous point.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:04:48
I am discussing the original comments revision of history where virtually everyone who thinks the block size needs to be increased also think segwit was a good idea.
But if you really want to debate scaling, what level of fees will you consider to be a non-bullshit crises? $5, $20, $50? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:34:07
It's only a doubling of coins if people want to sentimentally hold onto 4MB blocks on a chain with 5% hash power.

The miners decide on their rational self-interest by looking at a chart of client versions?
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:29:19
maybe i'm paranoid but if i was spinning up a dusty old drive, i'd look in the obvious places before doing a find / and scanning the whole filesystem, e.g. inviting head crash entropy.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:10:45
I'd say we're good if we can keep node requirements around $1,000 pc for the next 20 years. Most block size proposals are in that range
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:28:17
There is no attack vector on the Bitcoin network involving a majority of user nodes..  and even if there were, lowering the requirements of a node make it easier to accomplish such an attack, which I'll reiterate does not exist.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:40:46
The availability of non-mining full nodes is valuable to satisfy paranoia. I agree that without an easy way for merchants to be absolutely certain of transactions for a reasonable investment, adoption will be stiffled.
The necessity of a formula where non-mining full nodes needs to scale based on btc adoption is nonsense. You are ascribing to users the role of miners, which is not at all how Bitcoin works.

Say you want an ice cream cone, and you're willing to pay $5 for it. I don't have an ice cream cone, but I think that before the day is over, I could buy an ice cream cone for $3.50.
So what I do is steal an ice cream cone from a child and sell it to you for $5 on the spot. 
Then I buy an ice cream cone for $3.50 and give it to the kid I stole from.
I've now made $1.50 profit. The only thing it takes is parents willing to overlook me taking the kid's ice cream for a while (an exchange that supports shorting).
If I'm wrong though, I still have to give the kid ice cream, and if I have to pay $6 for it, I've lost money.
