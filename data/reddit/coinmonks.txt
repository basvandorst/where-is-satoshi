I am editor on Coinmonks and just simply putting what writer has said on above decoherence and other problems with QC in the same article.
"Quantum Computing technology is hugely complicated, and while the remaining hurdles could be surpassed earlier than experts expect (as was the case [when AI experts predicted in 2015 that AI techniques would not be able to beat a human Go champion]( for a decade, and then it happened the next year), it could also take longer than expected.
A key distinction to make is between “qubits” and “logical qubits”, a complicating descriptor on an already nebulous concept. It has been [estimated]( that a Quantum Computer would require at most 2330 qubits and 129 billion gates to crack Bitcoin’s secp256k1 elliptic curve implementation. As a reddit commenter aptly [put it]( **in order to be intellectually honest we must concede that the 2330 qubits refer to ideal, fault-tolerant, logical qubits, whereas the 17 qubits achieved in 2017 by** [**IBM’s quantum processor**]( **are raw, imperfect qubits which could be used to encode** [**7 logical qubits**]( Quantum error-correction of a single fault-tolerant qubit has not yet been achieved in experiments.**
The difficulties of error-correction, noise, and scaling should not be underestimated. They are likely among the most formidable engineering tasks the human species has yet faced. That being said, there are multiple avenues of research ongoing, into wholly separate qubit architectures, all with different properties and tradeoffs, some of which would be much easier to scale. Microsoft, for example, is working on highly scalable topological qubits and [aims to]( “scale to thousands, ten thousands, hundreds of thousands and beyond.”
News of QC advances is piling up quickly, with fundamental discoveries being reported frequently. Recent news includes research [which could allow quantum computers operate at room temperature]( for example."
