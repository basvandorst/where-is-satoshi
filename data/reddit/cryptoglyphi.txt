Why does the something have to be a currency at all?

Very nice concept, this is a well though out cartoon, it's too bad about the art though.  um wanna get some real sketches going on paper?  drop me a line if you're interested.

True however services like coinbase are necessary if bitcoins or altcoins are ever to really catch en masse.

Having to say "It's not just a boys club" kind of admits a prolem doesn't it?

So it "claims" a problem instead of just engineering something for everyone.

An interesting point.  Do current banking infrastructure require as much hashing power as mining.?  Do bank data centers have the same issue with having to cool facilities due to the machine generated heat?

The truth is intangible and increasingly subjective.  You indicated that you wanted to make sense of this discussion.  We redditors are merely attempting to help you with that.  Now you are looking for truth?

I see your point.  Could you not simply employ caps to the maximum you can use to "mine" or "get" from staking to prevent big players or "masternode" holders from dominating?

"It" is an advertisement designed to garner specific interest that points out a problem that wouldn't need pointing out if said problem did not exist.

**"ALWAYS BE CLOSING"** (picture and hear Alec Baldwin speaking while holding some brass balls)
Bonus points if you get the movie reference.
Yeah I would buy bitcoin and find those sweet faucets that used to give out one bitcoin every 15 minutes or something crazy. :-P.  Would also try to find Zuckerburg and warn those poor Winklevoss brothers or did that happen a little earlier?  Might also copywrite the MAGA brand just for shits and giggles.

I tend to agree modiggidy.  Why waste all that electricity if it isn't needed?

permissionless?  try signing up for coinbase lately? regulations up the wazoo.

Perhaps there is a "useful idiot" out there as you so kindly put it that will invent a third option that is neither POS or POW, thus eliminating the nasty problem of having to run thousands upon thousands of antminers 24-7 for a 'currency' or 'commodity' (whatever your preference) that exists solely in the cloud.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:18:40
POW has unwittingly led to a sort of centralization, giving more power to large groups of miners and equipment holders.
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:33:29
*edit* Title should read "Will all crypto soon **be** POS and move away from POW?"

How about altcoins?  Screw bitcoin... is anyone paying writers or humanitarians with altcoins?  anyone?

very nice, how can a person get sponsorship to such events?
