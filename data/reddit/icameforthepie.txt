Have you been in a new Lambo recently? They actually are tested like Audis. Actually, they're owned by the VAG.

The engine and transmission will not last as long as a traditional vehicle because they are not designed to last that long. Performance at the expense of longevity. This is all an assumption to a point since no owner actually drives their Gallardo 15k miles a year. I have no doubts the engines can actually last that long if they're not pushed hard (check out Ferrari's modern warranty and free service setup. These cars are built to last now).
The glove box latches and window motors are most likely standard VW Audi Group items since it makes no sense to engineer different parts (the physical switches may look different, but I'm talking about the actual mechanical bits).
With most modern cars at that performance level you are owning a compromised vehicle. It's something that's a little race car and a little street car. This isn't the 80's anymore when Italian sports car were absolute turds.
Take your standard Toyota Corolla, Audi A4, or Civic to the track on a hot day and see what happens. Design is a compromise. You're comparing a vehicle designed for commuting to something that isn't.

What do you do? I'm genuinely curious. I don't work in the automotive field, but I do spend a lot of time on track and have tinkered with cars since I was 14. 
I've been in some awful 80s-90s Lambos and Ferraris that screamed "piece of shit," but the newer stuff doesn't feel that way. Nor have I heard any complaints from the few people I know (literally 3) that have the income to buy vehicles of that caliber.

You're right, it's a general statement. As is referring to the vehicles as low quality. I started general because I assumed you had no idea what you're talking about. Now it sounds like maybe you work in the industry? Okay great, why exactly are they low quality?
A mass produced vehicle absolutely has more data points *once* it's in production that *can* lead to revisions in future updates of the model, however modern vehicles (as I assume you know since you work in the industry right?) go through very stringent stress testing before even entering the production stage. That's what I'm referring to.
I also have a hard time claiming anything that's able to lap Buttonwillow in 100 degree heat all day without breaking as low quality.
