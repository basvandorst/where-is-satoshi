I upvoted you for visibility

Paypal also takes big fees, and there is the chargeback issue.

Thank you! My googling time is very precious to me.

Downvoted because of the "upvote for visibility"

It's also not really ready for mainstream use, and services built around it are shady (i signed up on a website proposing to register your dot-bit for you. I now can't connect and support never responded)
But I agree it has potential.

Another adept of "buy high, sell low" ?

That is perfectly normal, else people would be placing shit-ton of orders, and cancelling them every time the exchange rate tanks, letting coinbase at a loss everytime. Note that it goes both way, if the price triples tomorrow you still get your coins at the price you ordered.

Bitcointip can give reddit gold ?!
I know reddit accepts btc for gold, but i didn't know the two systems got linked

Yeah yeah, it's over. We surrender, you win. Now you can stop coming here (please)

You gonna get a lot of different opinions on 2.
Ripple is not intended to be a currency, but some kind of distributed IOUs network (which could be used as a payment system and so compete with bitcoin). I personally don't like it.
I haven't found any interest in alt-coins, apart from namecoin which isn't really a currency either.

Nothing, it's old news
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:34:34
Oh god, i'm starting to imagine a kid raised by reddit...
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:52:08
Good but old news indeed

You could have done it without breaking the rediquette. Thanks for the compliment, kiss

My point is that your post would still have made it to the front without asking for upvotes.
People know giving upvotes give visibility, it's the base of reddit.
We don't need a "lik dis if u cry evrytime" to tell us what to do, it's just plain annoying.
But keep insulting me, it's a good way to discuss something.
