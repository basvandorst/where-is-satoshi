What happens to people from the US that bet today? Are you simply seizing the funds and running?

Yeah its all being resolved, no thanks to coinbase though.  My btc I sold to offset the charges temporarily will not be refunded though. Overall I'm getting back like 15,000, but also out about 100 btc.

I'm wondering if they will continue paying and debiting my checking account. I have instant orders that haven't been withdrawn and sell orders that haven't shown up yet.

I tried to track down where the btc went. From what I could tell it was sent through several shared wallets and ended up in Japan in a wallet with over 1,000 btc in it. I'm guessing this person had a serious operation going. Also, I didn't have funds in there. My checking acct was linked to the acct and verified for instant buys. I contacted them nonstop and asked to have my account unlinked(theres no option). It was slow at first. 3 btc here, 6 there.  I sold off btc from my offline wallet to offset it hoping coinbase would respond. Within 3 days, the culprit maxed out 50 btc a day. Despite my efforts, they did nothing. I sold all of my btc to cover the overdrafts going out of my checking acct. I'll get my bank charges back, but not the BTC I had to sell.

Despite my cleverness, I never intended to turn a series of independent losing bets into a winning strategy. I only intended to show a strange difference between bets with btc and bets with play money using the same provably fair system.

I received 0 messages from the 2FA number and someone managed to steal 50 btc a day. The company is a sham that takes weeks to respond.

Yeah, it allows you more room for betting.Edit: shouldn't say what I bought in at.

Ever consider a 3rd party audit?

This is basically the impression that I left with.

Even with their 2 factor I've been screwed by coinbase. Apparently, when somebody sends email after email for days straight about their account having unauthorized transactions- they think it's normal to white list it and allow someone to steal 5,000USD a day.

Great point on the cashing out feature. It definitely does seem to increase your winning.
@_date: 2013-06-25 03:00:12
Good point though.

What I meant is, what would happen if somebody from the US placed a bet? Does it get bounced back or does it simply remain at the address it was sent to?
