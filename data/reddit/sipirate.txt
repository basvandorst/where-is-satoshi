all Virtual currencies price support is strongly influenced by the miners sentiment of the currency.  BFL is going to sell chips before all preorders have been delivered basically devaluing the ROI on tens of thousands of pre orders which have already been debased by retarded delivery.

What your saying is volatitiliy attracts those who profit on valatility and when they do volatility goes down.

As an early adopter of bitcoin I want users of bitcoin as a currency not traders who rely on profits from volatility.

I do not disagree with you but your suggestion that had they delivered before the crash leaves open the possibility that the price would have been stable because an increase in coins for sale by miners as demand grew.
Unfortunately there is enough money tied up in BFL that when they fall the price falls.
Bitcoin should not be trying to get enthusiast miners - thats for the alt coins.  Bitcoin needs to deliver cost effective practical transfer of value.

@_date: 2013-06-02 19:19:28
Bitcoin trade volume is thin.  Meaning; people are not using them more or close to the amount being held.  Bitcoin like all virtual currencies prices is partly made up of the faith in miners to be able to sell the bitcoins.  When the miners can no longer profit from the vcoin, the price drops.  BFL has eroded the trust and faith of thousands of miners with their inability to deliver in a competitive, advantageous, or even a respectable time frame.  All advantages once thought to be BFL's by delivering a product with superior technology is being erased by them still not shipping the pre orders in mass and by flooding the market with chips before pre orders get their devices to use to mine.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:31:01
If you promised to buy one from them it would be as honest a deal as buying one from them at this point... they look intent on delivering something but weather it will have been worth anyone's time but their's is almost a given.... people are going to buy from these folk and squeak out what gpu miners are squeaking out today.
Read their posts from last year on,  I would not doubt if these guys bully their customers into either being sock puppet supporters via their **Stockholm syndrome guerilla marketing** techniques or just silent altogether so they can keep on collecting pre-order money.
Buy from Avalon or Asic Miner Stocks or rally a group EE students togeather to start working on 45nm to 22nm;  you might have a working miner in hand well before any BFL customer.

Ideally in the philosophical sense I think your right but.....  explain that to a market tied to fiat in the math of cryptography.... something is still missing in the equation.....

freicoin and some associated ideas that tie the price of the coin to a basket of tangible staples looks good right now.
I am not sure if it is freicoin itself or one of the ideas they were working with was proposing that the coin be tied to oil, gold, wheat and rice or something similar to keep that value steady.

I like the initiative but I am not convinced that this project is comming up with an actual distributed exchange...   From the threads it looks like the lead wants to rewrite lmax lib for node.js and worry about the state currency link last
If you release an opensource platform for exchange that can legitimately get Euros, USD, AUD, CNY, CAD, etc... in and out with trusted money transactions platforms then you will have done a great service.   Let exchanges pop up regionally at the hacker spaces of metro areas and you will have successfully created a distributed exchange system.  Or come up with a p2p client that can do the same... until then I  am not giving this project a whole lot of credit except for preying on the angst of a market correction.

Butterfly Labs records has a strong to very strong record of being "too good to be true".  Their record for honesty to customers, service to customers, return to early investors is ..... too good to be true if established as anything more than or equal to neutral.
The facts are the BFL engineering fabricated facts about their abilities and defended their abilities and production status with queer logic arguments to defend themselves with from customer questions and go so far as to berate and troll customers who called phoney boloney when they saw it months and months ago.  
BFL claimed to be a professional engineering firm and got beat to market 2-3x over by a college dropout.  Even their early customers will not see their money back in the time frame expected from statements made by BFL about the timeline and status of their handiwork at the time of sale.  If they were accountable to early customers as investors.... they would have been voted out or closed by now.

eventually the exchange software will get so good that the blockchain will be the bottleneck when settling accounts from trades.... the btc protocol should only be used to account for the transfer of the bitcoins not a platform for trading in and of itself.
I have a hunch if gox only let verified accounts trade it would even out the price to a fair value.... probably increase the price because of an increased scarcity and I doubt many other bitcoin exchanges have the depth of experience to handle all the refugee new customers they would get.... but it would distribute the weight in price afforded to Mt. Gox trades for the greater bitcoin community.

btc-e.com is great
Yes you do have to follow good security practices
    1. do not use any part of your email as a user name
    2. use a random password of a secure length 
    3. use 2 factor authentication
    4.  only iuse the troll box for fun not insight
In the west it is usually good to start talking about new tech and monetary issues with a local city politician as they keen to find opportunity and know well the political landscapes around issues.  Not sure how that would go over for an American expat in the Ukraine.  
Try to establish dots from Lviv to Berlin if you can where the dots are usual stopping places for road travelers.. ie amongst you and your friends vow if you are ever in Rzeszow, Krakow, Wroclaw to stop in at a pub or street market and introduce bitcoin to at least one person....  far fetched but a single footstep starts the journey the wise man says.
aside:  I wonder what tech savy gypsies travelers would handle bitcoin.  From what I know they seem like monetary libertarians who do not believe in fractional reserving finances.
I think the Berlin neighborhood that was recently highlighted in the [guardian article]( is a great example.
If bitcoin is only used online it will never proliferate a critical mass user base.  Bitcoin needs people using it not just tech savy and people using it in the street is awesome.  Start with a Pub, bookstores, artists, anyplace willing to try new  payments system and try to expand from there.  It would be great to add neighborhoods to bitcoin business maps in addition to the businesses itself.
Good luck and keep us posted.
