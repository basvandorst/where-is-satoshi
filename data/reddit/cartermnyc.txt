But how do we know it’s not The Ochino?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:53
oh my fucking god gdax is a mess right now
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:12:58
yes if you have USD in your account gdax can easily do this.  look up stop and limit orders and what they mean.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:59:28
yeah nothing there...  i think its gone forever.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:27:20
Post the code publicly! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:35:45
what makes you think they're not already awake?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:10:56
oh god.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:23:41
Dude why do you even try with these posts?  Just let these people vomit their story all over the Internet. All they want is to be told they made a “great decision”
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:08:44
So youre asking about a currency’s volatility when you personally think people aren’t actually using it?  Is it a question about people buying it long term just to hold?  Are you asking about a bull market bubble?  
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:42:59
Jesus fucking christ.  The people bitching about this have never had to actually do an international wire transfer before... probably because they're 19.  I hate this place.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:40:56
is this supposed to be funny or just bad?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:05:31
So you’re a troll that’s trying to make a point?  Cool Tuesday night...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:57:33
Google is a site where you can type in questions and get lots of answers.  I’m so sick of people not thinking about the bigger picture of crypto/chain transactions regardless of currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:10
currently watching a sell for 3100 BCH on GDAX.  it's hard not to think something is wrong here...
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:46:16
at coinbase?  probably not.  I think you're valid date plan is your best bet and still a great gift.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:58:27
this is crazy to watch.  17.5 to 17.1 in a matter of seconds.  cant believe someone is consistently dumping 1100 coins at 17.5 . Wild.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:13
did you sort by new?  i'm guessing not...
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:05:31
Lots of CNBC articles being posted today and this one isn’t well written.  As is tradition...
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:42:34
it's almost like a decentralized exchange is the best idea....
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:46:11
This is a great question for Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:25:22
posts like these are why i normally just read 4chan's finance board.  wtf is happening to this sub?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:54:11
I’ll add another tool. CoinTracking.info. It’s awesome. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:52
i wish.  sadly coinbase has basically melted down
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:34:37
Wtf happened to this place?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:42:41
I just upgraded to pro and it’s so easy. However there’s one transaction missing for me from some dumb old wallet I had somewhere that I can’t find. Other than that it’s been great. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:15:41
Shhh...  ��
Edit: pathetic he deleted everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:59:49
Exactly. There are so many fucking stupid people on this sub
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:59:25
How do you normally transfer internationally?  What are the fees?  What’s the conversion rate your bank gouges you on? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:22:45
I think until the fee problem is solved you’ll have a ton of resistance from the angry part of this community. Wait to see how LN is implemented then make it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:20:45
Yes I am. I Jd the same problem as you. As I have it now everything except my btc balance is perfect. Need  to figure that out and then I’ll be good to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:40:46
um... what?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:20
honestly cointracking.info is well worth the money if you're heavily invested.  the api integration is really great.  also it'll keep track of what you'd owe in taxes which none of the kiddos here seem to understand.  Capital gains tax (if you're in the US) will get the proverbial "lambo" repossessed if you're an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:05:45
new wall back at 17,250.  wowzer

What did they have for lunch in the cafeteria today?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:11:46
You sell your glasses for 20 bucks. .001 btc is like what 15 bucks?  Cool discount. I’m sure your margins took a massive hit for your support of bitcoin...  Thank/s 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:20:35
Completely ignore this guy, looking at his post history....  he gets his ass handed to him even when discussing ripple. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:40:24
well if you hate it there are a ton of other coins that are trying to compete so go buy ARK or something and stop trying to act self righteous.  
Having people talk about it was the fucking point you dolt.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:30:21
Pretty sure Coinbase is fdic insured if you’re a us resident. I use a Trezor wallet and to be honest if I don’t have it on me it’s a pain to watch market fluctuations and not take advantage of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:11:00
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:13:25
This is a fantastic sentence. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:49:08
the wonderful thing about this reddit thing is that I can click your little blue name and see that [you "supposedly" sold at $10,000]( (which you posted to your own profile - not this sub - or anywhere else). 
There's more to life than[ being negative in the entirety of your reddit account's short life](
And even if you're paid to do this and "dont care lol", you know it doesnt feel good...  Like deep down...
