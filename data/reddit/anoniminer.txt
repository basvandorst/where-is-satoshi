Not many appreciate what you said, unfortunately, even though it's 100% correct. People forget that markets are made of humans, who respond to very human incentives. Like not being "career ridiculed", so they will do something even if deep down they know it's the wrong thing. Like investing in a shaky market like the current one.

You are again spreading misinformation. You are free to fork any distribution of Linux, but it won't be the original. And bitcoin is not like "Linux", which is a catch all name for all Linux distros. Bitcoin is a specific cryptocurrency, and it's unique. So BCH is no more "a bitcoin version" than LTC is, or BTG, or BSV, or any of the 50+ clones/forks of bitcoin. Every crypto started with bitcoin, that doesn't mean they are all versions of bitcoin.

Please stop spreading false information, you'll get banned again.
There is no "other version of Bitcoin" anymore than there's an "other version of gold". Say you like bcash, or bitcoin cash, or BCH, whatever your preferred way of calling it is, but don't confuse with "other version of bitcoin".

BitcoinJ has also just been released with full SegWit support. Don't quote me on this, but I understand there's quite a few businesses using it. Might be related, if it holds...

Tell Shelly that Cuban is a dude who sucked your dick, and she's being extremely homophobic and invading your privacy by asking these questions. Tell her you're significantly in distress as well.

Wat? Running a node costs zero, or close to zero. How is that causing people to not run nodes??

Your understanding is so shallow, but you sure fill your mouth with righteous speak of a self proclaimed cult leader.

Lol And some people believe Earth is flat.
