I can use venmo for that as well, but I like the idea of starting to use crypto for daily transactions.

isnt one of the big reasons and the creation of Bitcoin to reduce fees? Why is it so high? What difference does it make between purchasing bitcoin through say coinbase only for them to take fee %?

Very true statement. This is whats not discussed enough about.

Hell no, I am FOR bitcoin. But I am trying to find a valid reason on consumer protection. I believe that is 1 of the 2 main obstacles they need to figure out before it officially takes over our current currency.
I agree, but at the end of the day, If we are trying to promote the positive aspect of btc, we should be able to figure out consumer protection. It WILL cause alot of scamming (it already does). Scamming happens every day, and people arnt worried about it as much because they know their banks will back them up for the most part. Having no consumer protection will push many of the people away from btc, and how will btc succeed if we can't bring those people in as well.

If the whole idea of bitcoin, or at least one of the main ideas is to allow transactions to be annonymous, doesnt that essentially mean there is almost no chance of consumer protection or the idea of a chargeback? 
In essence, wouldnt this mean that IF somehow we received consumer protection through the use of regulation or even insurance companies, doesnt that also go against what bitcoin is all about?
