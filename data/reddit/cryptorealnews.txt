The beauty about this meme is that it is TRUE &amp; FALSE at the same time! Like a clock that has stopped - It is still right twice a day! :)

I agree with you. If your in it for investing (not everyone is) then dollar cost averaging, as boring as that may sound, is the very best way. There is one good reason for this: NO-ONE knows where the price will be in the future! As obvious as this sounds, people still ask un-answerable questions like: Is this the bottom?, When is best time to buy?, Will Bitcoin die or moon? If anyone answers these questions with 100% certainty -  They are not to be trusted (unless they have a working crystal ball). 
PS:  
Here is a light hearted look at "Last night of Christmas" story book told by girl next to a warm fire but replaced with Crypto verses. It is funny but also says it all: [

Yes! The point of Bitcoin is Freedom (not price speculation).  
The price of Bitcoin at any one time is irrelevant for someone using it for transferring value around the world away from a rogue government, rogue bank, criminal, Spy or wrongly accused, etc.   
John McAfee also understands this and will run for President 2020 under "Crypto Platform for Personal Freedom"

Yes, exactly, wish more people talk about crypto creating freedoms and not "moon and price speculation".   
Here is John McAfee (like him or not) he has a platform that he will use to promote crypto as "Personal Freedom" Some really good questions and well answered too:[Crypto Politics - McAfee](

Any of top 10 are good info tubers. Just a matter of preferred style. There are plenty other very awesome ones outside top 100 too, so I guess these are the most popular and most successful channels but are they the best? Good list though. Well done!
