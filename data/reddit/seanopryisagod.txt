Yessir, would have been cool to have em, but such an unnecessary burden on your psyche to focus on something you can’t control
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:47:50
Your kind words and bode of confidence are sincerely appreciated

As a drug addicted fool, it killed me inside for a long time to see the price skyrocket. But I realized that if I became hella rich, I’d have ended up blowing it all on gambling and drugs anyways.
Going broke and dropping out of school was the only thing that lead me to rehab, now 2 years sober, I just finished applications to Berkeley as a transfer with a 4.0 gpa.
Going for MD fellas.

To save money, I used to buy amphetamine powder and use it as adderall, and sell my adderall online, I was one of the ones profiting from your purchases :p

I love you guys, didn’t expect such an onslaught of support :) I’ll be sure to keep y’all posted

you know, one of the things they hammered home in rehab, that I really took to heart (given how completely different the perspective was to the one I held) was that ultimately the future and past are out of our control and all that matters is our actions in the present.
I would love to end up as a Dr. Strange type neurosurgeon/neuro anesthesiologist but from what I understand, once you are admitted into a medical school, they assess you at 3 different points and that determines what you are allowed (?) to specialize in
I will cross that bridge when I get to it, but absolutely, I am aiming for the moon :)

Appreciate it brother, what you’re seeing is the end of a long long journey :) I’m really glad as well

No unfortunately not, I lost quite a few when Silk Road went down, lost 45 I sold to fastcash4btc bc I sent them to the wrong address. Like I said, it had me in a dark dark place for a long long time, realizing what I could have had. But I’m in a really good place now and view the whole experience as one of the most enlightening learning experiences ever, reminds me why I study every single day 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:10:04
Amen brother

thank you! It really is heartening to get so much support from you and the reddit community. It's  been a very private struggle for a long time, and I can honestly say I am the happiest I have ever been in my life 
In regards to my potential future children, my parents had 0 experience with and about drugs so they didn't figure out that the reason for my erratic behaviors was due to drugs. I will definitely be mindful of this and stay diligent to make sure my kids don't make the same mistakes I did
That being said, I am at a point where I am not sure if I want children, I may just want to be the old rich guy in the speedo tanning on the beach :)

Yeah I’ve been waiting a day for 3 priority tx to confirm, ugh
