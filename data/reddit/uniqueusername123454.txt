99% pow 1% pos, over time pos grows up to 99% and pow down to 1%, that way any massive issues that come up early will cause less damage.

you will also be 20 years older without ever have even enjoyed the money, so there is that to factor in too. thats assuming you make it 20+ years (glhf!)

i guess a balance between being too low and nobody staking (bad) and being too high and devaluing everything with lots of new supply (bad). 8% doesnt sound so crazy

Low thousands seems reasonable. It will never again grow as fast as it did in 2013, but I think there is still quite a bit of progress to go.

the richer you are the more of an advantage you have with POW (can get lower margins for hardware, pay for more expensive more efficient facilities, choose to locate in a place with low electricity costs). A small guy at home with a graphics card doesn't stand a chance by comparison.
with proof of stake you only need minimal hardware that is readily available - and that goes for if you are staking 32 eth or 32,000 eth.

if you have the same usage patterns on all then aren't you just increasing the chance that one of them will be compromised? surely better to find the most trusted/reliable/performant and stick with them.
