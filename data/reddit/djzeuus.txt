It frightens me that I've never heard of MultiBit...how did you hear about it to buy bitcoin? When you go through the bitcoin portal, there are plenty of top rated sites.
Not trying to upset you i promise. Have you emailed their support team? I just hope the site doesn't go Mt. Gox and steal all their clients money, hence why you need to know of their support team responds.

*curious new Bittrex user* I haven't had any trouble with them over the past month and a half, do I need to move? Also is Binance accepting new users? A lot of exchanges aren't or are taking weeks to verify due to the influx of new investors.
Thanks in advance :)

At the moment a Titan XP is the same price haha mine went from $320 to $945, and I nearly bought 2 back when I built it haha

That was my next thought as I used to use Armory wallet and you have to check fees online to be sure someone will hash the confirmation. Other wise they will overlook your transaction for a higher payout.

Which Then makes sense that we would use said money just like I use my debit card no? This is why I get confused because from what you just said we WOULD be eventually spending it like fiat. 
I mean even with a decentralized governance we have to be able to trade goods and services for other goods and services, hence why currency exists in the first place.
John grows Apple's and Harry makes tables, bit eventually both can't agree on how many Apple's equals a table and so on with every new good and service added.
What I'm really trying to wrap my head around from all of these wonderful and informative responses is, if part of bitcoin endgame will be I can use it to buy things in my daily life, or will it stay like stocks where you can invest, divest, etc?

Why would that be entirely pointless? We want it to be recognized as international fiat do we not?
People bid, bet, and trade on currencies already. I do myself on Euros, Yen, and Yuan. Depending on how the GDP and global markets do I earn or lose money.
If I'm missing something please feel free to fill me in on why one of bitcoin's main goals would not be to be accepted as fiat and thus usable at your local grocery or hardware store?
I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything cryptocurrency has to offer and macroeconomics, and if you have any insight is greatly appreciate it :)

Also how can you say this is PayPal 2.0...i use PayPal to buy things with money from my bank account. And if I put money in PayPal it doesn't appreciate not depreciate...so?
I'm confused entirely haha PayPal is not an investment. And yes the aim of bitcoin is to be able to use it to purchase something like we do with debit cards already, but with that and everything else bitcoin stands for, a better nickname would be currency 2.0.
The ignorance of some people to change is palpable *smh*

So I'm curious then about said the endgame goal of bitcoin. As far as what I've read I thought it was to ensure anonymity, and also maintain responsibility for transactions so that things like money laundering are weeded out entirely.

Just wait till it hits 400k. You won't regret it. I'm 25.5 coins in since $1175 and we've nearly 10 times-ed the value in less than a year ^^,

Well when you spend all your money on modern art and bullshit, and you want to be as rich as you were...you gotta look in the darkest corners of your bullshit and change your mind.
