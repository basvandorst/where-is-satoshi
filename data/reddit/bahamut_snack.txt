Using guiminer, adding the -w128 flag says, "phoenix.exe: error: no such option: -w"

I just switched to OpenCL and sure enough +10MH/s. Thanks!

You make a convincing argument...  Their setup is only PPS?  What's the other side of the argument - are there any pro's to staying on mt.red?
@_date: 2011-08-19 04:43:50
I actually just jumped from deepbit to mtred.
@_date: 2011-08-19 04:45:08
The card arrived today - I've been slowly tweaking my setup but it's hovering around 300MH/s now. :)
@_date: 2011-08-17 21:56:00
it's not much - running Diablo on an NVS 5100M.  I'm lucky to get 9MH/s right now - that will change when my Radeon arrives.

No deus ex - but I did get a copy of Dirt3 if anyone wants it.
@_date: 2011-08-18 20:57:55
I upvoted your comment for the attempt. :)
@_date: 2011-08-18 13:52:21
More of a proof of concept for me than anything else until I get my Radeon.
@_date: 2011-08-19 04:44:27
I've got that one - any idea what the other arguments are for -v and -f30?  is f30 maybe fastloop?
@_date: 2011-08-21 02:32:24
There is a PPS option on mtred too.
@_date: 2011-08-17 21:54:54
if I knew the codes for the look of disapproval, I would use it here.

It's just CPU mining right now - I haven't gotten the Radeon yet - it's in the mail.
@_date: 2011-08-18 20:56:51
on energy costs you mean?  My computers are on 24/7 anyway - is there that much of a difference in power consumption from idle to running the GPU at 105%?

LinuxCoin it is then, and boot from a USB stick I hear.
@_date: 2011-08-21 02:32:54
Indeed?  I'll have to give that a try. Thanks!
@_date: 2011-08-18 13:51:37
Thanks!  Any opinion on linux OS's?  Would a flat debian install work or should I look at that Mining OS?
@_date: 2011-08-18 13:51:51
I'll let you know if I get a copy.
@_date: 2011-08-23 19:18:07
Actually - signups are closed on ninjacoin. :(
@_date: 2011-08-17 19:26:12
will do!
@_date: 2011-08-17 19:26:55
I'm not sure - I just ordered yesterday from newegg.  If it comes with one you can have it if you want.  All my gaming is done on consoles - except for when I need my Ultima 7 fix.  Then I load up dosbox.
