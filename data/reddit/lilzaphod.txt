Yet people used depleted uranium for weapons.  It's a fucking paradox.  Or a pair of fucking ducks. Or a pair of ducks fucking. 100 ducks fucking horses?
Wait, where am I?

The biggest profits during the gold rush were made by the people selling the shovels and wheel barrows.

He should learn how the company assigns praise and blame so he can successfuly navigate the waters.

LOL.  Seriously, LOL.  They exist to feed off of student loans and bloat themselves endlessly.  Talk about a market needing a correction.

Don't do much hunting where you are from, huh?
Plenty of deer where I live. Small game like rabbit and squirrel as well.

Things like this makes me feel that Bitcoin itself is not even a safe currency to trade in.
Hard goods like bullets may be the only thing worth a shit in a few years.

And, you know, the Nomad Jukebox I owned that was a POS that skipped when I hit a bump too hard in my S-10 and was impossible to walk with.


Except people with, you know, Napster.
This is an anti-bitcoin circle jerk thread, possibly an anti-Slashdot circlejerk thread and not an anti-ipod circle jerk.  I'm done now.

Bullshit.  There's always rules.  They just aren't written on a nice piece of paper or always followed.

What schools aren't for profit?  shit...  I went to a BigTen school, and it was most certainly of the "for profit" variety.

And that is asmart way to do it - you've 100% covered yourself to have no loss and already recieved real gains.
Plus you still get to play in the market as it moves.

Guns.  Food and water are easier to procure if you have guns.

I had the Nomad Jukebox.  It had a shitty interface, skipped constantly, was difficult to update, and had 'decent' storage capacity of 6 GB.  I chose this after careful research into the market at the time.  The biggest downfall of the first gen ipod was that it was Mac only.
So I was a very early adopter as well.  While the initial iPod had warts, to say that 'hundreds' of other products that were 'much better' isn't really substantiated.

And that's the other purpose of the weapons - protection.
You do not have to be evil if you have a gun - you can be straight up ambivilant to anyone else you come across.  The gun just allows you a measure of self reliance and protection from those who wish you harm. It truly is the great equalizer.
