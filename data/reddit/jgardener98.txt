Some wallets allow you to attach a message with the transaction before you send the BTC. Electrum, for example, allows you to do so on the send tab.

I use blue wallet. It has lightning built in, it's open source, it has a store you can experiment with lightning on and has a very friendly UI

I read on another post that the article is clickbait and he actually only hinted to have bought $10,000 once, potentially. Interesting but not a weekly buy of $10,000...

This is uncomfortably similar to "you have to be intelligent to understand and appreciate Rick and Morty".

A lot of people are still likely 50-70% down. Me somewhat included ignoring this year. But I bought more near the low

In your example, people would probably prefer to call 0.0004 bitcoin, "4000 sats"

Coinbase is centralised, which a lot of people believe goes against the whole point of decentralised currency, such as bitcoin. A lot of people have reported that they have quite poor customer service but for a first purchase, you'll likely be fine. Most people would recommend you look into P2P exchanges / other decentralised exchanges for future purchases, however.
Also, use coinbase pro limit orders for purchases with 0% fees.
