It's a shame you're being downvoted. 10 minutes is kind of long for an average block time. Because of variance, it can at times take 40 minutes or even longer to find one single block. If the block time were 5 minutes, this would essentially reduce the longer variances by half, and 5 minutes is a long enough target time to prevent issues with network propagation and orphaning.

I possess the uncanny ability to think like someone with a differing viewpoint from my own.
So basically criticisms would be that Wall Street is currently only *experimenting* with Bitcoin, nothing is yet delivered, it'll all just be vaporware, and Wall Street will eventually get bored and move on from Bitcoin because they'll soon realize that Bitcoin offers nothing for Wall Street, just like how Bitcoin currently offers nothing for anyone now.
I can also tell you this view is incredibly shortsighted and stupid. But hey, that's in a nutshell. They hate an entire group of people mostly because some here in this community are overly enthusiastic about a revolutionary technology, and also because of all the libertarian-minded people that hang around here. They let their political ideology get in the way of something greater. And you know what? They get left out and will be late to adopt. No sweat off my back. Losers stay losers when they mentally corner themselves like that and refuse to look at the big picture.

I feel like I'm the only one here who doesn't care that Coinbase has my information. What the hell are they going to do with it that a bank doesn't already do? That's how I treat Coinbase -- like just another bank, except this "bank" lets me buy bitcoins. In fact Coinbase has less of my information than banks do. Coinbase doesn't have my social security number or my mother's maiden name. And yet they trust me enough that I could buy $50,000 in one day if I wanted to (or if I had that kind of money, lol). 
So many people in this community are outraged by Coinbase requiring info, but at the same time these people here want Bitcoin to be legal and for Wall Street to come join the party and make Bitcoin more valuable. You can't have it both ways, people. Either Bitcoin is a fringe thing not worth much, or it is mainstream and the avenues to Bitcoin are highly regulated. That is the reality of it.
I find that the biggest help to Coinbase trusting you is you give them everything they ask for, you do so accurately, and also be sure to verify a credit card with them. And don't do anything dumb with the coins you buy from them. That's all I did, and like I said, they trust me with buying $50,000 from them in a single day.

Uh, no. Ever heard of economies of scale? Processing 20x more transactions would be more profitable for miners than processing the current rate of transactions at 20x the fee price. Want to know why?
Two reasons. One is that 1MB cap sets a limit on how many people can actually use bitcoin. Fewer people can use it, fewer people value it and accept it as payment. Second reason is that Bitcoin users are not going to want to pay a 20x increase in fee price to make up for what could have been made with transaction fees by having higher volume. Instead users will start looking for alternatives to Bitcoin and flee this stupidly crippled platform.

Mining only gets *more* difficult as time goes on. It is orders of magnitude easier and cheaper just to preload the device with some satoshis. And if it ever runs out of satoshies? Still way cheaper for 21 to just front the cost and send more satoshis to it than to put miners into the devices.
The *only* reason I can think of a company wanting to put bitcoin miners in all the things is if that company is the owner and operator of their own mining pool. Then it becomes of a *control* thing, not some fictional cost saving thing that makes absolutely no sense, not even on paper.

There is no perfect way of doing *anything*. All you have to do is observe nature to realize how truly unfair everything in this universe is, and that no human system built on top of the natural world is any more "fair". Fair is pretty subjective, anyway.
The "first come, best served" model that Bitcoin employs is probably as fair as you could ever make such a technology. It was the people who had the foresight to Bitcoin's future potential and the drive to make it happen who were the people that got in earliest, and who have benefited the most.  Most all the early adopters who got into Bitcoin by luck and happenstance but didn't see the potential have either lost their coins or already sold them off long ago.
Bitcoin's distribution will smooth out as time goes on. Every man has his price. Earlier adopters will let go of some of their stash as value rises. What good is money if it is never used. You can't take it with you when you die. People will spend it.

I was just thinking about this the other day. A question I once asked when I was a kid - as I'm sure every kid asks eventually - was "how many dollars exist in total?" and I would later find out to my dismay that such a question is unanswerable. Which I found baffling. How could something that is man made (paper money) and something that is so valued not have a definite number? It astounded me. You'd think that was something we could and should know for certain.
With Bitcoin we know exactly how much exists today and how much will ever exist in the future. Never in human history has the supply of money had such certainty. Well, I take that back. We can never know for certain how many coins have been *lost*. But at least we'll always know the absolute maximum of coins there can be.

I love Bitcoin, but with the way things currently are, I'll pay with credit card more often than not. Credit cards give you: cash back rewards, better consumer protection and other various other perks. Not to mention it's like getting an interest-free 30 day loan if you pay the balance in full every month.
Paying with bitcoin is a hassle, if for no other reason than the tax burden. And if you're a long term hodler then you need to rebuy those coins, incur fees from exchanges and fees to the miners. The only time I'm paying for something in bitcoin is if I get a discount, or if the price has risen significantly and I need to rebalance my portfolio.

Think of a fork as being like a parallel universe. The fork itself refers to the exact point that paths diverge.
Imagine for a moment that today is like any other, except today you work up the courage to talk to a girl you've been wanting to ask out for months. Let's call this point of whether she says 'yes' or 'no' to going out with you a fork in your life. If she says yes, let's say you hit it off well and end up getting married and having kids, you move to a new city, get a new job... your life is very different. But let's also say there's a parallel universe where she said no, and your life continues on a different path than had she said yes. **In both parallel universes, your lives are exactly the same up until the moment that fork occured**. It isn't until that yes/no decision on that day that your life paths begin to diverge.
The same sort of thing happens when Bitcoin forks. One day a block that is bigger than 1MB will be produced, and there will be a yes/no decision on whether that block is valid, and now we have two Bitcoin blockchains existing in parallel. The history is exactly the same up until the point things fork. So when the fork happens, your coins before the fork occured exist on both chains. So yes, you now own 10 GavinCoins and 10 PeterCoins. However, due to natural laws and the way Bitcoin works, it is unlikely both chains will exist for long. One chain will become worthless and die out while the other will take over.
So the problem becomes if you want to spend bitcoin, which chain do you use? The safest thing to do is wait. If the hard fork is planned to occur on a specific day, just don't fucking use Bitcoin on that day. Pretty simple if you ask me, but everyone makes it sound like the world is going to end. This is only a problem for people who are uninformed, but if you are an early adopter using experimental software, you deserve to get burned for not keeping up on current events. However if you're that ignorant to a planned fork, you're also very unlike to touch Bitcoin on the day of the fork anyway, so your odds of losing coins are pretty low.
So just to reiterate, don't touch your bitcoins on the day of the fork and you'll be fine.

Again, because it's most efficient, most cost effective, and easiest to just use Bitcoin's blockchain rather than to try and reinvent the wheel.

I'm glad some people around here are smart enough to realize this.  Running a full node out of the goodness of your heart in hopes of making Bitcoin more decentralized is an absolute fool's errand. The miners (specifically the pools) are the be-all end-all of how truly decentralized Bitcoin is. And guess what, miners are full nodes themselves, but they actually get paid to be full nodes. Everyone else running a full node is just wasting their time and money for "charity", unless you are a Bitcoin service such as Coinbase. Then it makes sense to be a full node. And they can afford whatever the bandwidth requirement is.
So many people are disillusioned that Bitcoin can both be popular and completely decentralized. Well, it can't. Email became popular because of more centralized services like Hotmail and Gmail, which meant people didn't have to configure and run their own email servers anymore. Grandma isn't going to care if the block size limit is 1MB or 1000MB, because the ability for her to run a full node has zero meaning to her. All she wants is something inexpensive and easy.
So then people argue "well maybe Grandma shouldn't be using Bitcoin, and things should always be difficult and niche". Can't those people see the big picture? What the hell good is a money that hardly anyone uses? A money that no one uses doesn't have much value. Why shouldn't we want Bitcoin to be more valuable?

Agreed. Though I'd say it's also a huge end-user problem. Imagine a time not far in the future when 1MB blocks are constantly being filled to the limit. Only a very finite number of people will be able to use bitcoin. So we prioritize transactions by whoever pays the highest transaction fee? Okay, but how do you know if you paid enough? The frustration of trying to get a transaction through only to have it continually get it rejected makes bitcoin absolutely unusable for everybody, and new users will especially be turned off to bitcoin.

I don't think Bitcoin will ever truly die, even if for some reason it never takes off. There will always be the diehards keeping it alive. And because of Bitcoin's global reach, there is the chance that if western culture is unwilling to adopt it, some other culture might.
Things like the Apple Newton personal devices were too far ahead of their time and were total flops. That's one of your examples of a good idea that was unable to penetrate the market, only to later find success when the time was right. But I think Bitcoin is different in that no one entity controls it, and anyone is free to adopt it. You don't have the same kinds of hurdles with Bitcoin as you do when trying to get an expensive device to market. Because of Bitcoin's openness, growth can happen organically and seemingly out of nowhere. I mean, maybe for some reason Bitcoin will be huge in Brazil 2 years from now. No real idea why, it just kind of happens out of nowhere. Because Bitcoin is regionless, having major adoption from anywhere in the world impacts everyone who is in Bitcoin in the rest of the world. This might cause a sort of bootstrapping feedback loop for adoption in other cultures.
You can't put the genie back in the bottle with crypto-currency and uninvent Bitcoin, so it's not ever going away. Some people argue that maybe a different crypto will overtake Bitcoin, but I have yet to see one convincing argument as to why that would happen.

Fads tend to be things of cultural amusement. Stuff like yo-yos and razor scooters come back in popularity with a vengeance, only to disappear into uncoolness a few years later. It can also be a very regional thing. Then there's stuff like Pet Rocks and Beanie Babies which never make a comeback. However, the theme is the same. People don't get into these fads for the utility. They are into them for entertainment or vanity. These are wants, not needs.
Bitcoin is different in that it has the potential for immense utility. The only "fad" element to Bitcoin are all the get-rich-quick speculators who have come and gone. But looking at the grand scheme of things, the peak of Bitcoin's "fad" era didn't even make a dent in mainstream culture. And so the naysayers will proclaim that Bitcoin has clearly failed. But I say the true fad era hasn't even begun yet. Then there's the question of will it ever really go away? If enough people find Bitcoin useful, it won't be a fad.
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:16:07
I agree that at this stage, popularity of bitcoin will definitely continue to ebb and flow in waves. I suppose that is why people see Bitcoin as "fad-like". It won't be until some sort of tipping point is reached that these popularity waves cease, and Bitcoin's utility is fully realized and it becomes an everyday part of modern culture, and calling Bitcoin a fad will be viewed as just as silly as calling the Internet a fad. Will this tipping point ever be reached? I think it will, but I'm prepared for it to take 20 years! Who can say for certain what will happen, though.
