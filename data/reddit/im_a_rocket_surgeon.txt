Trolls are not really part of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:59:45
Yes, there is no going back now. 
(At this time we are close to 3,000 BTC volume so far today).

Google "Bail-In" + "Cyprus", they will even  confiscate your money that is in the bank.

I'm pretty sure there is not. &gt;90% of cash is digital, not physical.

If the bridge is burned, you use the bitcoin boat available 24/7, everywhere, to everyone.

Don't worry, just like the internet, it will happen, they can't stop progress (just delay it).
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:26:04
No, the point is to create awareness, most people does not know this is happening. The point is to let people know they need to get their hands on food, cash, gold, silver and bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:35:54
Great news!, now Europe and the rest of the world will follow, this is not only more regulatory clarity but it is very favorable for bitcoin, the moon is closer every day!

Why not? As happy as leveling a rotten and uninhabitable house to build a brand new one on its place. Life is full of cycles, do not cling to the old, and allow new technology to help to build a better future for everyone, not just for a few privileged ones.

What is your background to be considered to work with them as a bitcoin expert?, Are they using the bitcoin blockchain for their tests or the plan is to use a centralized/private ledger?

No, just buy and hold.

You don't need Coinbase or "be smart" at all, just click on "Bitcoin" and pay, very easy, it is already integrated directly with their own bitcoin address, been using them for a while.

Not fake, probably the author was pressured by bank to change language, this info was a leak that was not supposed to be out yet.
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:00:36
That one guy was probably trolling you and wasting your time, 21 calls and 3 hours dedicated to one person is far from efficient, causing you to neglect people who really can be helped. Please set a limit of time and calls one person is allowed, so you can optimize your resources.

Great service!, What features are you planning on to expand in the near future?
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:46:31
Bitcoin today (2015) is actually up more than 10,000% from 2008, not a bad ROI, with ups and downs (bubbles) in the middle.

Thank you for your response, can you hint at least if the bitcoin blockchain is involved? that does not reveal anything sensitive about their plans.
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:22:52
Actually, exactly the opposite is happening, they are selling overvalued stocks and buying undervalued bitcoin silver and gold.

I found it rather interesting and comprehensive. You missed her talking about smart contracts and many other applications, giving the right amount of time and credit to the permissionless distributed ledgers, while also arguing in favor of the possible uses for the permissioned ones.

Bitcoin's legitimacy is growing in laps and bounds. A couple of years back these news would have exploded the front page, now they are just one more of many great news for bitcoin.

Are you the real Giovanni Capriglione? If so, thanks a lot for all your work, you have my utmost respect. Are you up for an AMA here? I think a lot of bitcoiners would be interested in your great projects.
