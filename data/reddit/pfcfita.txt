Can confirm, I was at a ballgame last week with a bunch of reasonably well off folks between the ages of 35-50, 50-75% had heard of bitcoin, all of them thought its just a fad/fake money.

You should short it if you feel so sure, especially at 12-13k. Easy money.

The value is determined not by code but by the market (supply and demand). Right now more people are willing to buy at 3600 than people are willing to sell at 3600, so the price goes up to 3700 where there's an equal amount of sellers (supply) and buyers (demand).
It's the same market forces that determine the prices of food and services you buy elsewhere, as well as the prices of any other currency or stock. 
In contrast to other goods/stocks/currencies, the code ensures a finite number of bitcoins (no more than 21 million will ever be made).

lol, then short it if you're so sure. Your opinion isn't worth shit without skin in the game.

Yes this "internet" thing won't last

Just keel hodling. 
Don't try to time the market if you really believe in bitcoin's future. For all you know the bottom of the next dip could be significantly higher than $4300. For stock markets, history is full of people who waited for dips that never came.

$150? cool story bro ;)

If you think about it most money is already digital rather than physical. 
I don't think government issued currencies and gold will go away in our lifetimes, but I think cryptocurrencies will complement existing asset classes significantly. The truth is somewhere in the middle between the two extremes of "bitcoin will replace all money" and "bitcoin is just fake money and just a fad".
In particular bitcoin has almost all the properties to complement and *potentially* supplant gold and short term bonds/cash as a store of value, with several added benefits.

You can buy tiny fractions, as small as 0.00000001 BTC

Volatility is decreasing with price increases, and would likely be similar to volatility seen between major currencies at nosebleed valuations.

Don't forget Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway and Apple. Completely unsustainable growth.

Thanks for your thoughts. I would argue that bitcoin is our ticket away from debt/slavery based economies. I'll definitely check out the link.

"Bitcoin is too decentralized."
I think you may be misunderstanding the technology. The more decentralized, the better :)
"why should I rely on some Joe Blow to tell me how much my work costs?"
The market does this every day outside of crypto, and I would expect  nor desire anything different :)
"I'll emit my own currency: pfcfita's"
The ability to issue an infinite number of coins is a feature, not a flaw. :)

Your bank account and Visa card are just zeros and ones inside a computer too, and would be just as useless in Puerto Rico right now ;)

Welp, I think you and I understand bitcoin, markets and even Communism very differently, and it doesn't sound like we should discuss this any further because of those differences :)

Does anyone else ever worry about becoming a target for break-ins or other forms of robbery by advertising that you hodl bitcoin? That's what's keeping me back from rocking BTC and crypto swag.

If it were to get to nosebleed valuations, the hope would be that crypto would either replace the conventional financial system, or exist in parallel. There would no longer be a need to "convert it to dollars". :)

Your idea that the market "works terrible" as seen in 2008 is a reason why you and I can't see eye to eye. In my view the market has been the biggest driver in humanity's since the 1400s :P
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:27:47
Yes, mine’s not working either!
Too bad, must be crashing from all the demand! They’re the biggest company in bitcoin but even they must be having trouble scaling :P

coinbase will let you buy $100/week on your credit card, coinsquare will let you interac e-transfer up to $3000/day. Both take larger fees but they make it super easy.
