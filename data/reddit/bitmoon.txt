Slovenia Times notes that only 50 Slovenian companies currently accept Bitcoin, “a look at the frequency of bitcoin-related searches by Google users in Slovenia indicates a positive trend for the future, as the country places ninth in the world.”

Will consider getting a few of those. Can it be mined easily?
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:49:36
Can one withdraw BTC funds via Virwox to Visa Cards?
@_date: 2014-05-29 06:42:11
This answers my confusion. It's a big mining rig market out there everyone wants to sell :D

Displaying Bitcoin symbol in place of ads is a good way of promotion bitcoin if only Adblock could consider this. Anyone from Adblock reading this please get in touch ;)

Best method. If you need to take some out.
Scan your private key. Cash out as required and send them all to a new address then send the coins to a new paper wallet
