As other's said in this forum,  maybe is due to the fact that China is a capital  controlled country...many rich dudes used and still use cryptos not only to invest but to transfer/hide capital out of the country....and we all know that Chinese government don't like that
Also Chinese elections are in the way, most probably that influence a lot of things

The question has meaning only for those that  live under oppressive regimes...
All the others, that we live in the "free" world we don't accept and we must not accept ever that kind of prohibition because that will lead us to another form of dictatorship

I am also new to the game,  but I really think that we cannot make a comparison this time from the other historical dips....
This time (IF China will be REALLY out - and that's a big IF, cause as we know Chinese gov is manipulative) it will take a lot more time and money to close that loss...
China is a huge market and i am pretty sure, that they have plans of their own 
controlled blockchain/crypto market

Yep..the fact remains though...they will close apparently, so nothing really changes
