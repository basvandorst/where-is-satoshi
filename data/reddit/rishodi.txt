@_date: 2016-08-30 11:03:21
Okay. I watched your video. Now you watch [this one](
I'm guessing that what you're missing is the fact that lending money increases the money supply, and that this fact is true for all currencies even when the monetary base (M0) is unchangeable, as is the case with Bitcoin. I used to have the same misunderstanding myself.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:11:46


You're wrong here again. If a depository institution accepts 100 BTC and loans out 90 BTC, it is operating at a 10% fractional reserve. The borrowers could receive actual BTC, not some other token. It would work the same as any other currency.
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:26:09


Debt is theoretically unlimited in a fiat monetary system in which new money can be created at any time by the central bank. It's also theoretically unlimited if the reserve ratio is unlimited. But there are practical limits in any case.


There shouldn't be. Lending is a necessary part of a healthy economy, as is a functioning market for interest rates. In Bitcoin, credit is currently extended through P2P lending, and the effect on the money supply is the same: new loans increase it, and paying off loans decreases it.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:44:56
No, it is you who misunderstands how fractional reserve banking works and the concept of the [money multiplier]( Money is not created "out of thin air". It is lended from deposits on hand; this process repeated through multiple iterations is what leads to amounts borrowed at a multiple of available deposits, as determined by the reserve ratio.
To continue the provided example, the 90 BTC are then deposited into other depository institutions, of which 81 BTC can be lent out (maintaining a 10% fractional reserve). That 81 BTC are deposited again, and 72.9 BTC can again be lent out. Following this geometric series to its conclusion yields maximum total outstanding credits of 900 BTC from the initial 100 BTC deposited.
Fractional-reserve banking does not require a central bank. It can be used in conjunction with precious metals (whether with actual metals, or metal-backed certificates), fiat money, or cryptocurrencies. It does work differently with fiat money, as reserves can be created and injected into the system by the central bank -- this is the money being created "out of thin air" that you're referring to. But that is not a defining characteristic of fractional-reserve banking, which can be conducted with literally any currency.
Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) do not necessitate full-reserve banking. However, they do make it far easier to publicly verify that a depository institution is utilizing full-reserve banking by keeping all customer deposits accessible rather than lending them out. Coinbase's vault is an example of this: funds deposited by a customer go into an address and stay there, making it trivial for each customer to verify that their deposits are not being lent out, and may be withdrawn on demand at any time.

It's not too fast to fill a new block for properly optimized mining software. It should take &lt;1 second to parse and verify transactions in the most recent block (perhaps a little longer if there are multiple very large transactions), and &lt;1 second to form a new block using the highest priority transactions currently in the mempool.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:50:19
At a protocol level, no, that is not correct. An RBF transaction can be replaced so long as 1) it has not yet been confirmed in a block, and 2) the sequence number, which is used to indicate which version of the transaction is most recent, is below the maximum.
That being said, I am not familiar with particular wallet implementations, and some wallets may limit the user to only using RBF once.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:09:55
That's how legacy nodes view blocks. SegWit-capable nodes see all transaction data, including segregated witness data, which makes the total footprint of blocks greater than 1MB each.

Beyond being an incentive for miners, the fee market is also necessary to incentivize large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem to economize their usage of the blockchain.

The Samourai wallet prioritizes privacy above all else, so it's important to users to note that any time you send bitcoins from a SegWit address to a legacy address, your change will also be returned to your wallet in a legacy address, and so any future transaction from that utxo will not utilize SegWit. Thus, Samourai is not an ideal choice for anyone who prioritizes minimizing transactions fees over privacy.

Recommended reading: [BIP 173]( regarding the Bech32 address format.
Basically, the common implementation of SegWit involves using P2SH addresses (beginning with "3") which are backwards-compatible, but also an inefficient use of space.
Bech32 addresses (beginning with "bc1") are native SegWit addresses, and they will save a significant amount of space on the blockchain following widespread adoption. However, there are very few wallets which support this format yet.

If roads were privatized, then the owners and people who have a vested interest in the roads would maintain them.
Have you ever driven past a road sign that says "state maintenance ends here"? It's common in rural residential areas, and past those points road maintenance is generally conducted through a voluntary neighborhood covenant.
Privately-owned highways already exist in many places. They pay for road maintenance using the revenue they receive from tolls.
I can't speak for all locales, but where I'm from the Adopt-A-Highway program is very popular. All the public roads with the least amount of litter are those that are cleaned up by charitable organizations.

That's not true; the expected outcome depends on the reward methodology of the pool. Early on, many pools distributed income proportionally, and people quickly devised [pool-hopping]( strategies which would increase their expected income by switching pools at particular times.
Pool operators largely responded to the practice of pool-hopping by implementing rewards methodologies which were immune to it, such as PPS, PPLNS, and DGM. However, some pools, such as Slush's, still use reward methodologies which are vulnerable to pool-hopping.

Edit: You may also want to lower the number of active connections by setting maxconnections in bitcoin.conf (the default is 125). If you haven't done so already, I would start there before using QoS.

It's no coincidence, since that's precisely how that calculation was done, just in the opposite direction. $18/second is the market *value* of all bitcoin miners in operation because, on average, that's how much is earned by all miners each second (although it varies depending on the current exchange value).

Wow, I had no idea that the ATM worked that way. That's a terrible implementation and it's no surprise that it's been giving you trouble. As someone who has pushed a decent amount of volume through Bitstamp, I can vouch that withdrawals are usually timely, but there are occasions when, for one reason or another, I have had to wait for hours for a transaction to actually appear moving the coins out of my Bitstamp wallet.
The ATM *should* have its own hot wallet which is used to hold a float in bitcoins and send them directly to customers. There should be two configurable variables: the minimum and maximum amounts to be stored in the hot wallet. Whenever the hot wallet falls to the minimum value or below, a withdrawal request would be submitted to Bitstamp to refill the wallet to its maximum level. Each customer transaction generates only a buy order, not an immediate withdrawal request.
Implementing this would not be difficult and it would make your system much more robust. You would only need to withdraw from Bitstamp a few times a day at most, and you could configure the minimum amount to be large enough to last for several hours in case a refill transaction were delayed. You could guarantee that your customers would always receive their bitcoins immediately because transactions would be served directly from your own hot wallet instead of being dependent on someone else's. Surely it would make Bitstamp happy as well to see you making fewer and larger withdrawal requests.

However, it most certainly does not provide *more* revenue than other pools. There are other ways to mine with 0% fees, and even accounting for the fee structure at most pools, you'll typically pay 1-2%, which is fairly trivial for the reward of maintaining a properly trustless and decentralized system.

That way there's no risk of malicious action, as there clearly is if you allow an untrusted party to access your computer.

Nope, that's not even close to what I wrote. MtGox was the very first platform for exchanging bitcoins and was purchased by Karpeles in early 2011. By the end of that year, several other exchanges had come online, including Bitstamp and BTC-e, which took over the bulk of bitcoin trading during the fall of MtGox two years later.
MtGox had the largest share of the market for 3 years because it was the very first exchange and had months of lead time on its closest competitors. It's difficult to imagine an alternative scenario in which MtGox or any other exchange could have amassed an even larger share of the bitcoin exchange market and subsequently experienced an even greater loss.
Many other exchanges have scammed users. Many others have been the victim of theft. But none done so on the same scale as MtGox. The loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins under Karpeles' management of MtGox is by far the worst thing to happen to Bitcoin during its few short years of existence.

That's mathematically impossible, since the algorithm used to derive the public key from the private key is deterministic. A private key will always produce the same public key, which will in turn produce the same address.
However, OP is correct that there are many more possible private keys than there are possible addresses. Therefore it stands to reason that, in theory, there could exist multiple private keys which map to the same address. In reality, the chances of finding any such collision is infinitesimal.

There aren't going to be any more "big difficulty jumps" -- at least, certainly nothing like the 30+% jumps that were happening last fall. The current average difficulty increase is about 12% and on a downward trend.
Let's say that two days before a difficulty jump, your pool has an unlucky streak of 50%. That means that you and everyone else on the pool earns half of what you expected for those two days. Then the difficulty increases by 12%, and you have a complementary two-day period of 150% luck at the new difficulty level. Averaged over the four-day period, the luck is at the expected 100%, but what does revenue look like?
Let's say you were making 0.1 BTC per day at the first difficulty level. You'd be making about 0.0893 BTC at the second difficulty level. Your expected earnings would be about 0.379 BTC for that four-day period, assuming steady 100% luck. Adjusting for the streak of bad luck followed by good luck described earlier, your actual earnings for the four days would be 0.369 BTC. That's a difference of less than 3%.
And that's only focusing on the 4-day period immediately before and after the difficulty increase. If you broaden the scope of the analysis to include the full 12-13 days both before and after the difficulty increase, you're looking at less than a 1% difference in your revenue caused by an unlucky streak which occurs immediately before the difficulty increase.
That's not "a lot less". That's a relatively insignificant amount.

You misunderstand precisely what was meant here. Post-prohibition, if a whiskey distillery has a dispute with a wholesaler, or a wholesaler has a dispute with a retailer, they can settle that dispute through arbitration or openly in civil court. In a legal market, there are legal means to seek contract enforcement and dispute resolution, which makes violence unnecessary. Today, economic transactions involving alcohol are not correlated with violent crime as they were during the prohibition era. (Note that [the murder rate increased during prohibition]( and then decreased after its repeal.)


There's where your logic went wrong. The drug market is far from a free market; it is a black market. The recreational drug market is legally prohibited and government organizations aggressively seek out and punish anyone they can find who is involved in it. When disputes arise between two or more parties in a black market, they cannot turn to the prevailing systems for dispute resolution, such as private arbitrators or civil courts. This is why settling disputes in black markets commonly involves violence or threat of violence.
Dark net markets such as the Silk Road facilitate safe trade in the black market by allowing parties to engage in business online (unlike street deals, in which dealers and consumers are in close physical proximity) and by providing trusted third-party escrow and arbitration. If drugs were legal, such businesses could operate and thrive openly, much like businesses do in many other markets today. As it is, dark net markets are providing a valuable service which did not exist (nor was even possible) on a large scale in the drug market until very recently.


At the consumer level, traditional black markets are highly localized and competition among dealers is often territorial in nature. Consumers typically have few local options to choose from, and they have no way to provide feedback other than word-of-mouth. On the other hand, on dark net markets consumers can choose from thousands of vendors located anywhere in the world, and they can leave feedback which is instantly available to all other consumers. The difference is monumental.

Yes, but the effect will not be immediately observable. The market for mining hardware will respond to signals from the currency exchange market, but for several reasons, it can take weeks to months for such a response to materialize. Trading hardware takes longer than trading bitcoins, and there are still a lot of people waiting on pre-ordered ASIC miners. Furthermore, any response in the mining market will likely be less in the form of existing miners being shut off and more in the form of a decrease in the demand for mining hardware.
Unless the price drops precipitously, the difficulty won't decrease in the immediate future. With the deployment of ASICs always in limited supply, the difficulty increases have been lagging behind the rise in the value of bitcoin for months. The growth rate of the difficulty may continue to slow, but I don't expect an actual decrease in difficulty anytime soon.

No, I explicitly addressed Internet bandwidth, which is becoming faster rapidly throughout much of the world. For example, fiber optic connections to residential areas are currently being deployed by multiple companies in cities all across the US. Like most computing resources, Internet bandwidth is rapidly becoming faster and cheaper.
It's true that the initial sync of the blockchain is a significant barrier. However, this is a problem that can be solved by implementing pruning. At some point in the future, I expect that a majority of nodes will need to prune data anyway. A larger blockchain would merely make this a higher priority, and I see no reason why it's not technically possible to implement pruning within the next few years.


No; that was part of my point. I have an old home media server which also happens to be running bitcoin, because the resource demands of running a Bitcoin node are currently trivial. This could remain true while allowing Bitcoin's resource demands to grow at a slow but steady rate on a per annum basis.


Bitcoin users don't need to run bitcoin nodes, of course. But for those who want to, it's easy to put together a dedicated Bitcoin machine made of used PC parts for &lt;$100. The type of people who don't have dedicated computers running 24/7 already are likely not the type of people to be running Bitcoin nodes anyway.


You're right that this may be a significant psychological barrier, though it is important to recognize that it is psychological, and not technical. If one intends to run a Bitcoin node indefinitely, taking a few days -- or even a few weeks -- to bootstrap that node seems irrelevant in the long term. But again, pruning and increases in residential bandwidth will both make a substantial improvement here.

This is a rather silly argument, considering the actual requirements of running a node and the cost of adequate hardware for doing so. For years, I've been running a full node on a home server that I built back in 2009 for less than a thousand dollars, and Bitcoin's resource usage is minimal.
As long as the resource requirements do not outpace the price-indexed resource capacity of consumer-grade computer hardware, then we should expect resource usage to have little to no negative net effect on the number of full nodes run by individuals. Hardware costs everywhere are generally going down, and speed and capacity is going up. The cost of HDDs per TB is about 15% of what it was in 2009, and Internet connection speeds are significantly faster (my own has increased tenfold in that time period, with another large increase expected in the near future).
By all means, let's restrict the resource usage of Bitcoin nodes so that they do not outpace technological improvements in consumer hardware. However, this is a weak position from which to attempt the argument that resource requirements should not be permitted to grow at all.
To use some real-world numbers as an example, in 2009 I built my home server with 3TB of HDD storage. Those drives cost a total of $600 at the time. If Bitcoin's maximum block size were expanded to 2MB immediately, and every block mined hereafter were full, then 3TB could store about 30 years of Bitcoin transaction data. But realistically, in the 8 years since I have upgraded my server's storage capacity twice (all the other hardware remains 8 years old). Although sudden, rapid growth would have negative side effects, I expect that a conservative annual growth rate of about 15-20% would be sustainable indefinitely.

This is not necessarily true.
It is necessarily true if the bitcoin is transferred directly from the purchaser to the seller.
However, it is not true if a middleman is involved. Most sellers accepting bitcoin use a payment processor such as Coinbase or Bitpay. In these cases, the consumer has whatever protections are provided by the payment processor (which may be zero or non-zero).
Bitcoin itself neither implements nor prohibits consumer protections, and thus it can be utilized either way.

The space for addresses is indeed significantly smaller than the space for private keys. Since version 1 bitcoin addresses are 160 bits (excluding the version identifier and checksum) while private keys are 256 bits, theoretically each public key corresponds to an average of 2^96 , or about 7.9\*10^28 , private keys.
Note that you would still have to iterate through 2^159 , or about 7.3\*10^47 , private keys to have a 50% chance of finding a collision.

If you want to lower the upload rate so that Bitcoin isn't hogging your connection, you can decrease the maximum number of peers permitted to connect to your node. My node doesn't upload near 65GB in an entire month. Even if the block size were doubled or quadrupled, nodes could certainly be configured to fit within the provisioned upload bandwidth for a majority of residential broadband consumers in the US.

You're ignoring the fact that there are also economic incentives that would limit block size, like the Internet speeds in China. Miners can set their own maximum block sizes, and do so -- for example, Antpool commonly mines blocks that are 750 KB. It's unlikely that any of the large Chinese pools would voluntarily mine blocks much larger than 2-4 MB, because doing so would significantly increase their orphan rate and thus decrease their revenues. Scarcity of block capacity would remain without a hard limit set by the protocol.

Yes, and it's followed by the Coinbase-associated address he was trying to send 5 bitcoins to. Thankfully, I was able to verify that none of the addresses posted by OP in this thread can form a private key corresponding to the address where his funds ended up.

The QR code was malformed due to the omission of a colon. The data that was scanned, being a string in Base58 format, was considered a valid private key.

I can confirm that the missing colon when generating QR codes is a Coinbase app bug. I first noticed it last week.
However, that bug is not responsible for what happened here. A QR reader scanning a malformed QR code should report that it is invalid. The real question is: where did the receiving address come from? It certainly did not originate with the QR code provided by Coinbase. It's impossible for corrupt or malformed data to produce a valid bitcoin address by chance.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:27:37
I was able to replicate the problem. Using a screenshot from OP's video, I was able to make Blockchain.info's QR code scanner produce the exact same address which is shown in the video.
I also was able to correct the malformed QR code from Coinbase (by adding the missing colon), and this resulted in Blockchain.info showing the correct address.
Therefore, I can say with certainty that this problem was not the result of malware. It is almost certainly due to a bug on Blockchain.info whereby malformed QR codes are not properly error checked.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:35:34
Checking up to 8-10 characters is plenty. Beyond that, not only are the chances of the address being different minuscule, but it would take significant computing power to even create an address with that many characters in common.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:23:13
Pending further investigation, I disagree. A missing character should not result in lost funds.
This is a failure of Blockchain.info's error handling. You must expect that users are going to scan all sorts of QR codes which do not contain valid bitcoin addresses. If a QR code is malformed, it should not produce a valid address. This is 100% Blockchain.info's fault.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:41:14
At first, I was highly skeptical of the claims made in this post. I thought this was likely the result of either malware or user error. But upon taking a closer look, neither is the case.
I was able to replicate the problem exactly as OP did. Using a screenshot from OP's video, I was able to make Blockchain.info's QR code scanner produce the exact same address which is shown in the video (1CpwMvHBu4hRWw1qQ9h2QEincQhhH8xfMa).
It is true that for at least a week, Coinbase's mobile app was generating malformed QR codes with a missing colon. (I noticed this bug myself on Thursday, July 27.) So, I tried correcting the malformed QR code from Coinbase by adding the missing colon, and this resulted in Blockchain.info scanning and displaying the address correctly.
Therefore, I can say with certainty that this problem was not the result of malware. It is almost certainly due to a bug on Blockchain.info whereby malformed QR codes are not being properly error checked. Developers *must* assume that literally any data can be input into a QR code scanner. If it is not 100% correct, it should be disregarded. The scan should either fail, or an error message should be displayed to the user informing them that the image contains invalid data.
I can't investigate any further at the moment, but I will try to dig in deeper if I have time. This occurrence was the result of two interacting bugs, one of which was the fault of Coinbase and the other the fault of Blockchain.info. However, since input error checking is a crucial and indispensable component of software engineering, and malformed QR codes could be produced by innumerable sources, it is my professional opinion that Blockchain.info bears full responsibility for this occurrence and should fully compensate OP for his losses.
However, it's also my professional opinion that Coinbase should be responsible for displaying the textual bitcoin address any time that its corresponding QR code is displayed. Failing to do so is borderline negligence, because it makes it unnecessarily difficult for users to verify addresses when sending bitcoin transactions without copying and pasting, as OP did in the video.
**Edit**: I was able to verify what happened. The malformed QR code, no longer conforming to BIP 21 spec, nonetheless was recognized as a Base58-encoded private key by the Blockchain.info wallet. So the string of text "bitcoin*1aDdr3sS...*" was itself interpreted as a private key and used to derive the associated address, which is where OP's funds were sent. I waited to divulge this information until I could return to this thread and verify that the addresses OP posted in this thread were not the ones where he tried to send funds. If one of them had been a match, anyone could have stolen the misdirected bitcoins.
OP will be able to recover his funds using the list of addresses which are associated with his Coinbase account. One of them will be a match. It remains my opinion that Blockchain.info bears responsibility here, because it makes no sense to allow users to send to a bitcoin address derived from unchecked private key data. WIF and mini private keys are acceptable, since they have error-checking mechanisms built in. I opened an issue on github [here](
**Edit  Thanks to for the gold!
I received a response from Blockchain.info via github: "Thanks for your research. We have been following the Reddit thread and came to the same conclusion. We are preparing a PR to refactor and fix this issue."

A BIP21-compliant QR code comes in the form "bitcoin:1aDdrR3sS..." where the part following the address is a bitcoin address. The only thing that differentiates this string from a Base58-encoded private key (which is a 40-44 character alphanumeric string, excluding the characters "0", "O", "I", and "l") is the colon. The relevant Coinbase app bug neglected to include the colon when generating QR codes, and without that colon, Blockchain.info interpreted the data as a valid private key (which it is), and generated the associated bitcoin address.
Reconstructing the private key involves merely locating which address the OP was trying to send to, and appending the prefix "bitcoin", just as Coinbase did. From this private key is derived the address to which the 5 bitcoins were actually sent.

I think that's a good path forward. However, getting everyone to agree on a single on-chain scaling proposal is a significant challenge.
And we all have to realize that the reason some people are blocking SegWit is because they see it as their only bargaining chip. If they concede it, they don't trust that a hard fork to increase the block size will ever actually happen.
Thinking in terms of game theory can help solve this standstill and get everyone what they want (more or less).

Considering that clarification, I find your statement all the more absurd. Ignoring your interesting conception of the phrase "all the time", the hashing difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks and has been rising at an exponential rate for some time. Seven months ago the difficulty was 2 full orders of magnitude below its current level, making your statement completely irrelevant in regard to the present.
For comparison, I could probably find a very old person who has paid an average of $0.50 (in nominal dollars) per gallon of gasoline purchased over the course of their lifetime. That may be true, but it's completely irrelevant to what the price is in the present. However, even this analogy falls short since over a period of [90 years]( in the US the price of gasoline has risen by 1 order of magnitude, not 2.
I suspected from this post that you were new to mining, but rather it appears that you've been solo mining for some time and are new to pooled mining. Unless you're running a huge operation, which I suspect you're not, you should definitely transition all of your miners to pools.
Edit: It also occurs to me that 3 blocks over the last 7 months is an abysmal rate for multiple GPUs. At the start of Dec. 2010, 7 months ago, the network hashing rate was about 70 Ghash/s. With a single Radeon 5770 solo mining at 200 Mhash/s, you would expect to find an average of 3 blocks per week at that difficulty. Are you solo mining with nVidia GPUs?

That's very true. I certainly think it's reasonable to expect that the number of transactions per block will increase. I decline to speculate on the future value of Bitcoins because in the long run it's unclear whether the generation rate will exceed or trail the continued growth in its popularity. Nevertheless, that is clearly an important variable.

There's a world of difference between a transaction fee charged by a business for a service and a tax imposed by a government on certain services.
It's also fallacious to think that such a tax would "generate billions in revenue". To the contrary, taxes merely reallocate funds from one place to another; unlike business revenue, they are not the result of producing and exchanging goods and services. In fact, they would be quite effective in undermining asset liquidity in any market in which they were implemented.

This is not the cost of processing Bitcoin transactions, but rather the cost processing transactions *plus* the cost of Bitcoin mining. Assuming that 300 Bitcoins are generated per hour, and each is valued at the current price of about $9.50, at the current rate the equivalent of $2850 in Bitcoins is being generated every hour. **This is not related to the cost of transaction processing.** The network could process 20 transactions per hour, or 20000 transactions per hour, whether 50 coins are generated per block or none. As long as mining to generate Bitcoins has a positive yield, the cost of processing transactions cannot be measured in terms of the cost of generating coins.


Irrelevant, since the two cannot be compared directly and your computation for the cost of each transaction ignores the incentive of miners to generate coins from new blocks.


You're assuming that costs will remain static, at least proportionally, after all coins are mined. There's no justification for such an assumption. There are a number of factors to be considered here, and transaction fees are most certainly not the only variable. The number of people using Bitcoins can change; the number of miners can change; the transaction rate can change; the value of each Bitcoin can change. The only safe assumptions are those that have been hardcoded into the protocol. While you are correct that we can expect transaction fees to increase, the total cost of electricity at the present time is not relevant to future expectations of the cost of transaction processing sans mining. The generation rate is designed such that transaction fees will replace all coin generation gradually over a long period of time. The size of the network will adjust to compensate.


Using your own calculations, at the marginal rate every $1 spent on electricity for mining creates more than $2 in new Bitcoins.


The money comes from miners. Since many miners have already recovered the fixed cost of their hardware investment, they will continue mining as long the value of the coins they generate is greater than the cost of electricity used to generate those coins.
It's not sustainable in the long run because the number of Bitcoins generated per block will decrease. If transaction fees do not increase to compensate, the profitability of mining will decrease and some miners will cease mining as a result.
Edit: As pointed out below, the statement in my last paragraph is made ceteris paribus. That the value of Bitcoins holds constant is likely an incorrect assumption, but nonetheless thinking in this manner does expose some of the economic forces that are at work here.

Unless you're mining on enough GPUs to form your own small pool, I can assure you that the current difficulty is high enough that you're not finding blocks "all the time."
The total Bitcoin network hashrate is in excess of [11 Thash/s]( the equivalent of about [29,000 Radeon 5870s]( At the current difficulty, assuming the target rate of 1008 blocks per week, approximately 29 Radeon 5870s mining at 400 Mhash/s each would be required to average just one block per week.

I'm going to need more evidence before accepting this claim at face value. There's no quantitative mention of the computer's processing capacity, nor of the relative capacity and time it would take to compromise SHA-2.
If such a computer is capable of rendering cryptography as we know it to be obsolete, then we have far more important matters of concern than Bitcoin. The entire Bitcoin market is worth perhaps $100 million dollars, an infinitesimal fraction of worldwide financial markets. The stability of these markets, and thus the entire global economy, is dependent upon the security of modern encryption methods. Any computer capable of defeating SHA-2 would be capable of toppling all online finance and Bitcoin would be the *least* of anyone's worries.

Orphaning valid blocks is absolutely against the protocol, if it were to happen as a result of miners colluding to ignore all blocks from a particular miner. In such a scenario, 51% or more of miners would ignore all blocks from the victim by mining from a shorter chain when the victim finds a block. Doing so would effectively orphan all blocks mined by the victim and completely shut down the victim's mining revenue.
But perhaps we're talking of different things, and this was not the intent of your original comment.

A 51% attack is any scenario in which one or more miners controlling a majority percentage of the total mining capacity of the network decide to act contrary to the existing rules of the bitcoin protocol. Orchestrating to orphan valid blocks from Antpool would constitute such an attack.

Do the math and you'll find that there is 9.9 MB of transaction data included in about a 130-minute time span. Since the network is expected to produce 13 blocks over that span on average, capacity is at 76% of its limit.
I spent several years working in scale and performance testing for a large software development company. Our target goal for capacity was usage of 40% or less on average. The idea was that if we aimed for 40% or less, there would be enough spare capacity to be able to handle peak loads during high demand. Generally, this rule of thumb held true.
Bitcoin does currently not have enough capacity to promptly confirm transactions during periods of peak demand, or during unlucky streaks in which miners are finding significantly fewer blocks than normal. Snapshots of time periods in which transaction demand is low, or miners are luckier than usual, does not disprove this fact.
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:58:55
Over the selected time period of 130 minutes, one would expect the Bitcoin network, on average, to add 13 blocks to the blockchain. 18 blocks were found. That's a lucky streak: 38% more blocks than expected, and thus 38% more capacity than expected.
The total size of all the transactions included in those blocks is about 9.9 MB. If, over the same time period, miners had been unlucky and found only 10 blocks, each of those 10 blocks would have been completely full. If miners had found fewer than 10 blocks, each of them would be completely full, and there would be at least a few thousand transactions still waiting on a confirmation.
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:13:24
This would be a satisfactory explanation if outgoing transactions from Coinbase were being broadcast to the network promptly and remaining unconfirmed for some period of time. However, that's often not the case. With Coinbase, there is often a delay of hours between when a withdrawal request is placed and when the transaction is actually broadcast to the bitcoin network. Just a few days ago, I was waiting for an transaction from Coinbase for about 2 hours before it appeared in my wallet as unconfirmed. The first confirmation took significantly less than 2 hours.
Such delays have been commonplace for years, which is why veterans in the Bitcoin community have long warned against using Coinbase, or any third-party service, to store bitcoins or act as a wallet. Users can only request a withdrawal; they do not possess the necessary keys to actually send a bitcoin transaction, and so they are left to the mercy of the provider.
In this case, the user is doing the right thing by withdrawing bitcoins from Coinbase to a locally-managed wallet. Unfortunately, in so doing he is discovering firsthand one of the reasons why doing so is generally recommended as best practice.

In my experience, most libertarians are more realistic: Bitcoin solves precisely one major problem (and all the issues stemming from it), which is state control of currency.
But on the (perhaps overly) optimistic side, if Bitcoin were to reach mass adoption, and if it were effectively able to reduce tax revenues significantly by making tax avoidance or evasion easier, then it would be a tremendous tool in starving the state financially. I certainly think it has potential on that front.
Bitcoin on its own isn't going to solve all the world's problems, but it is a significant step in the right direction.

I avoid untrusted domains anyway unless I use a sandbox. NoScript is less important for me than it is for people who often click on suspicious links, like my parents. Even if NoScript had been installed on my desktop, I don't believe it would have helped. On my laptop I have every site I use regularly whitelisted, including localbitcoins.com, and the forged requests would have been permitted.

Hence I limited the amount of coins I ever kept in my localbitcoins wallet at any one time.

The lender will insist upon verification of the funds you plan to use as a down payment. Many lenders use a 60-day timeframe, such that any large deposits made within the last 60 days must be documented and accounted for. They do this in order to check that you aren't borrowing money from a 3rd party in order to pay the down payment.
As long as you're prepared to discuss Bitcoin and reveal the source of the funds in USD coming into your bank account, you probably won't have a problem.

Simple economics. Right now the price is lower on CampBX because it is difficult to get USD into that exchange, which results in relatively low demand. The price in USD at BTC-e has historically trended lower than most exchanges for the same reason. The price at MtGox is higher for the opposite reason: it is difficult to get USD out of that exchange.
Once CampBX accepts ACH, it will be much easier to deposit USD, and the price gap will shrink substantially.

Suffice it to say that I agree with your final paragraph but disagree with the middle one.
For example, if the value of bitcoin had plummeted by 80% over the period of the past year, and a mining rig created double what you paid for it in bitcoins a year before, that would still be a loss, even though in terms of bitcoins it was profitable. Evaluating gain/loss in terms of measures of value which are themselves highly volatile can create highly misleading results.

There is always a risk of delay whenever you use a thin-client wallet because they are necessarily dependent upon a third party, such as Coinbase. You can request that they send a transaction to the Bitcoin network, but there's no guarantee that they'll do so immediately. Thus, you should never use such wallets when making payments that require real-time receipt. Always use a thick-client wallet instead, which will allow you to send transactions directly from your device to the Bitcoin network. There are several such Android apps you could use for this purpose.

The records kept in the blockchain are what coins belong to which addresses. The blockchain is completely agnostic of who actually owns any particular address. The only way to prove ownership of an address is by possessing the corresponding private key. If you lose a private key, then you lose all bitcoins held in that address.
The only way to recalculate a private key is if you have the seed values required to compute it again. For example, if you had an Electrum wallet and you saved the seed values for your private keys, this could be done.

Granted, there is no definition of "drug" which is universally agreed upon. My own definition of a drug is irrelevant here, though I would not classify any carbohydrate as a drug, but exclusively as a food.
The point I was trying to get at -- and which you have already made for me -- is that sugars (in your words, sucrose specifically) form in nature. If you choose to define any particular sort of sugar as a drug, then that definition is dependent on the chemical form of that sugar, not its origin. Thus, your use of descriptors such as "processed" and "refined" are irrelevant, because either all sucrose is a drug or none of it is.

That's highly misleading, and in my opinion, flatly inaccurate.
The specifications of the Bitcoin design, as implemented in code, are indeed what governs its operation, but they are not subservient to the whims of any central authority. Quite the opposite is true: Bitcoin works because a *decentralized* conglomerate of user nodes agree on what the rules governing it are, without any singular person or governing body having the authority to change those rules.

That is true: in other words, commodities such as oil have utility as consumer goods. Bitcoins do not; their utility lies solely in being a medium of exchange. However, this is actually an advantage of using Bitcoin as a currency instead of commodities.
Physical goods like petroleum or precious metals have utility both as a medium of exchange and as a raw material used in consumer goods. However, using gold or silver as a currency or as a means to store value has the side effect of driving up the cost of products for which they are a manufacturing input, such as electronics with gold contacts. Bitcoin does not exhibit this effect, since the only utility of bitcoins is as a currency.

I see no problem with using the term *narrow money stock* for a currency's valuation in any denomination, particularly [for comparative purposes](
Besides, if you want to get technical about it, the amount of bitcoins which have been created thus far isn't the same as Bitcoin's narrow money stock either, since a significant but indeterminate amount of coins have been permanently lost or destroyed. Thus any expression of Bitcoin's narrow money stock, regardless of denomination, is only an estimated theoretical value which represents an upper bound on the actual amount of coins which are still in circulation.

I do agree with that; however, it allows for analysis that is strictly limited in scope. It involves a false dichotomy: rather than buying a mining rig or buying bitcoins, a person could instead choose to sell bitcoins, or simply choose not to buy.
Any of these choices could be optimal or not, or profitable or not. Depending on the fluctuation of the value of bitcoin, *both* buying a mining rig *or* buying bitcoins could be profitable, although one is likely more profitable than the other. Likewise, both choices might be unprofitable, although one is likely worse than the other.
If a person has already resolved to obtain bitcoins, then you're correct: evaluation may be done in bitcoins to determine whether buying mining hardware or buying bitcoins directly is a better choice. But if a person is interested primarily in profit, then analyzing the other possible options, and taking into considering any fluctuation in the value of bitcoin, is a requirement.

Any number will do. Right now you could download the Bitcoin source code from github, modify it to allow you to create as many "coins" as you want, and run a node all by yourself. In fact, you could modify whatever you like in the source code.
However, you would no longer be running Bitcoin, but something else, since the Bitcoin protocol is strictly defined and no other users would recognize the deviations permitted by your node.
This is true no matter how much of the network tries to implement protocol changes. Even if you were able to convert a majority of Bitcoin miners and nodes, there would be no way for you to force your changes on the users who disagreed with you. They would continue using Bitcoin according to its original specifications, and a hard fork would occur. Such an event would almost certainly be disastrous for Bitcoin as a whole, but the point is that there is simply no way for anyone, even a majority of miners or developers, to force changes upon the entire network as long as a substantial number of users reject said changes.

Bitcoins are generated according to a specified schedule which has been pre-determined since Satoshi brought the first Bitcoin node online. Any attempt to deviate from that schedule by creating additional bitcoins will be rejected by nodes and miners which do not accept the change, thus creating a hard fork in the blockchain. Users who do not agree to the change will be unaffected.

Much of the rest of what you said is correct, but this is not. Certainly, insurance is frequently a good idea in to avoid the possibility of financial ruin, even though its expected value is negative. However, it's undeniable that insurance leads to [moral hazard]( The moral hazard arises for the insured party -- in this case, that's the depositors, not the banks. So long as their deposits are under the insured limits, depositors currently have zero incentive to care about the quality of the financial management and responsibility of the institution(s) that they trust with their money.

On a technical note, while a person can survive without *consuming* any saccharides, they are indeed required for survival because the brain requires some glucose for energy. On a zero-carbohydrate diet, although the brain will switch to receiving the majority its necessary energy from alternative sources such as ketone bodies, the body will still metabolize some glucose for use by the brain.


That's to be expected, since "drug" is itself a highly contestable term, just like "narcotic".


That's what drew my attention, as that choice of language often indicates an internal inconsistency. As you're likely aware, a lot of people choose to make needless distinctions between natural and processed sugars, even though chemically the sugar molecules are, of course, identical. I was curious to know whether you were one of them, and am glad to find that you aren't.


That point could spawn an entire discussion in itself on how unfortunate it is that most people view "drugs" as bad, and distinct from foods or medicines, when in fact many things fall into more than one of those categories. It's strange that most people in the US don't think of ethanol as a drug. They also have a strongly negative view of heroin, and a positive one of morphine, since it's widely legally available in any hospital, even though the two drugs are closely related, have similar effects, and some hospitals overseas use heroin rather than morphine for pain management.

That transaction spends inputs which are unconfirmed. If you follow the chain of transactions backwards, you'll find several unconfirmed transactions, the first of which appears to be this one:

A few hours, or even a few days, may certainly be reasonable and expected when dealing with traditional payment systems and methods of moving money.
In the world of Bitcoin, however, several hours is an eternity. If I broadcast the same transaction from my personal PC, it would be received by every well-connected node in the Bitcoin network within seconds and typically be placed in a block within minutes.
Coinbase has been dealing with this issue for some time. They are the *only* Bitcoin business with which I have experienced unexpected delays on multiple occasions. In all of their replies that I've read regarding this problem, not once have they indicated that their hot wallet ran empty. Typically their excuse is that their bitcoind instance had de-synced from the rest of the network.

What you're referring to is the creation of valid Bitcoin addresses without first generating a private key.

However, you can't send bitcoins to an address which is a randomly typed string of characters, because the checksum would be incorrect and the address invalid. The client (and the network) will ignore attempts to send bitcoins to invalid addresses.

I immediately contacted localbitcoins.com staff, but have yet to receive a response. In the meantime, the scammer appears to have successfully stolen funds from several other users.
Although I take responsibility for stupidly clicking on a link which clearly led to an .html file, some fault must also be placed with localbitcoins.com. Their attachment system does not sufficiently sanitize input. It is only supposed to allow .png and .jpg files, which is why I clicked on the link without thinking anything of it. However, the attacker was able to upload a .html file containing malicious JavaScript. Obviously, there is no legitimate reason why any user would need to upload an .html file.
Perhaps even more importantly, localbitcoins.com desperately needs to implement authorization upon withdrawal, which would go a long way to block the ability to steal from users through a wide variety of attack vectors. Confirmation of withdrawals, whether through the blockchain or through release of funds in escrow, could be done using e-mail. BTC-e and Bitstamp, for example, both give users the option to require authorization upon withdrawal. No withdrawal is actually processed until the user clicks a confirmation link sent to their e-mail address.

There's nothing which necessarily prohibits anyone from operating a Bitcoin deposit-and-loan institution which pays interests to its creditors, charges interest from its debtors, and operates on a fractional reserve. The primary reason it hasn't happened yet is because of Bitcoin's wild volatility; once that settles down in a matter of years or decades, Bitcoin lending will likely become more commonplace.


The money supply increases any time that any lending occurs. It doesn't matter if you borrow $500 from a bank or borrow $500 from a friend, the money supply increases in the process. What doesn't change is the *monetary base*: the amount of actual currency in circulation. The same is true for Bitcoin.

While I agree that Bitcoin is a movement for all of humanity, and I hope to see it continue to grow and positively impact human life on a wide scale, the concept of a decentralized digital currency is undeniably, innately libertarian.
Here I use the word "libertarian" in a general sense to mean simply anti-authoritarian or anti-statist. It should be quite obvious that many things which we could deem "movements for humanity", in the sense that they improved the quality of life for many people on a large scale, were libertarian in nature.
For example, the abolition of slavery around the world, particularly from the [18th to early 20th centuries]( was a movement that vastly improved the lives of many people. During the Age of Enlightenment, the political recognition of individual rights such as the freedom of speech and religion was a massive step to secure individual sovereignty over the authority of the state. The worst states in existence are those that actively deny and suppress such individual rights (e.g. North Korea).
Both of these movements are not only entirely congruous with the Lockean concept of self-ownership, but also logical and necessary conclusions of that principle, which has been a cornerstone of libertarian philosophy for centuries. Bitcoin is different primarily in scale, a difference which I hope to see shrink over the coming decades.
Bitcoin is an extraordinary technological achievement. It not only denies, but *precludes* central authority. No central bank or issuing authority has control over it; the control is firmly in the hands of the individuals and organizations which own and use it. No state will be able to stop it without shutting down the entire Internet. It cannot be inflated. It cannot be counterfeited. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible; once confirmed, they cannot be used to commit fraud.
Likewise, any movement or technological advancement which directly challenges the authority of the state could also be deemed libertarian. The Internet itself is certainly libertarian, which is why many of the more authoritarian states in the world work diligently to restrict the extent to which their subjects can utilize it (e.g. China). The global exchange information made possible by the Internet (thus facilitating the work of organizations like Wikileaks) is absolutely a libertarian ideal in that it is antithetical to the notion of control by a central power.
Bitcoin is not *solely* for libertarians to use any more than freedom of speech or freedom of contract are solely for use by libertarians. These things are for all people, and they enhance our lives as a result; they challenge the power of the state and are thus libertarian in nature.

Bitcoin is not [fiat money]( There is no centralized issuing authority which is backing the value of bitcoins by [fiat](

No, you weren't just unlucky. You were a goddamn idiot. You have no fucking clue what you're doing and you need to stop now before you lose even more money.

I'm not hating, I'm just calling it as it is. I'm a huge supporter of Bitcoin and I spend more time now in this subreddit than in any other. You're absolutely right that most people here would discourage such reckless financial decisions. However, there are also a number of fools and blind optimists among us parroting the idea that Bitcoin is easy money. Those voices have to be checked for the sake of the vulnerable and ignorant, like the OP.

Use cgminer. I wouldn't recommend using a CPU for mining though as it will cost you much more in electricity than it's worth.

Definitely not never, unless Bitcoin itself falters.
Right now, ASICs are highly sought after to the point that buyers are willing to pay a significant premium for a working system, to the point that many purchasers can likely never expect a positive ROI. Once ASICs are widely available, and the difficulty skyrockets to many times its current level, the hype driving the speculation will die down, and both the primary and secondary market will reach equilibrium at a price level where there is some positive ROI to be had.
I expect this to happen sometime in 2014.

Like many Bitcoin skeptics, Peter is not a computer scientist or a mathematician and he doesn't have the technical knowledge to easily grasp the concept of cryptocurrencies and why they are so important and so different from all prior online currencies.
However, I agree that he would be likely to change his mind if he could be brought to understand the concepts underpinning Bitcoin and why it meshes so well with his ideology.
