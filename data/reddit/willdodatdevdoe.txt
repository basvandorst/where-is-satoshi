Got a long way to go.

Going to keep falling occasionally bouncing off large round numbers where a bunch of idiot FOMO pseudo-investors set their buy-ins for a while I think.  [This was today](

Okay so what part of the bubble did you buy at?

Bitcoin is the kind of market where if you are some kind of super trader you can make a lot of money buying and selling dips.  If you are the kind of person where you aren't watching the market 10+ hours a day the entire DOW is going to the moon right now so there is really no reason to play with fire.  A lot of dumb greedy people threw their gasoline onto the Bitcoin bonfire a month ago and now they are burning off.  I don't really see the point in going long on Bitcoin right now with all the hype, accusations of price pumping, and boom/bust that will clearly happen in the short term.  Not like Bitcoin is the only game in town.  Clearly the underlying concept is here to stay and there are a lot of opportunities on coins that have a lot more room to go up if you are looking to go long on crypto.

Yeah when LA, Tokyo, and the entire Korean Peninsula are craters and every international currency collapses and people are straight up trading gasoline and bullets for food I'm sure imaginary internet gold is going to be super fucking useful.
This is the dumbest shit I've read all day.

Except if you "panic sold" 24 hours ago you sold at 10.2k instead of holding until it hit 8.9k.  You can always buy back in when it bottoms out.  Makes me wonder how many people here are giving shit advice because they are over-committed and need to hope this is a dip and not the obvious crash.

Probably to stop churning.  With my credit card rewards if I could easily buy something for $1 and sell it for $1 I could buy $5000 worth of it and sell it immediately to pay the credit card company and they would owe me $75 in rewards.  Now I just do that everytime my CC payment clears and suddenly the CC company is just handing me $600 a month.

Your investment strategy is literally a meme and you bought during a bubble.  The good news is I can only assume you didn't even get a whole coin so just learn a lesson from this and be glad you weren't at this stage in your life back when they were handing out subprime loans to anything with a pulse or you could have done some real damage.

Oh, well in that case your investment strategy is literally a meme and you bought during a bubble. The good news is I can only assume you didn't even get a whole coin so just learn a lesson from this and be glad you weren't at this stage in your life back when they were handing out subprime loans to anything with a pulse or you could have done some real damage.

Yeah who doesn't want to take the long position on a $9k digital currency that's value is heavily tied to speculation?
