Before the hardford, I supported the NYA compromise because I though, "hey, it's just a 2MB increase. It wouldn't hurt." It probably wouldn't hurt that much if the community goes with a 2MB HF. My thinking has changed. Changes should be based on technical merit alone. There should be no politics. If we compromised on this, then what will the next compromise will be? And the next one after that. So IMO, changes to bitcoin should base solely on technical merits not political compromises. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:14:06
I always try to open it when an open ear. Of course his argument is flawed.
1. Although he stated that bitcoin is a currency, he still doesn't have a good understanding of bitcoin.
2. He said bitcoin is a bubble because there is no way to put a valuation on it like other assets (i.e. stocks)
3. Gov't can freeze your bitcoin placed on an exchange. Gov't can't freeze your bitcoin if you don't store it an exchange. 
I have heard pretty much all the arguments from these so-call legendary/famed investors. They really really don't understand bitcoin and keep drawing comparison to other assets to justify that bitcoin is a bubble.

To sell BCH, open a Bittrex account.  Deposit your BCH to your Bittrex account and trade for BTC (or other currencies).  
You will need to wait for the number of required confirmations required by bittrex before you can trade though.  It could take awhile for BCH to get confirmations.

I wished the host would've delved more on the technical of both segwit and BU. And how is this fuckwit is the voice of BU anyway? I hate name calling but this guy really is a fuckwit.

No hate for ETH. I used to shill for ETH saying that it has so much potential because of all the Dapps building on top of ETHs (although I didn't understand all the fancy buzzwords at the time). With time and understanding, I realized that they were really just buzzwords. The size of the blockchain is out of control. No one is able to run a full node even with top equipment. No working product any any ERC-20 tokens (except for cryptokitty). 
@_date: 2019-02-01 07:38:07
First, you should have a good understanding about bitcoin before thinking about a buy. It is currently a bear market now but the bottom is uncertain. If you're investing for the long term, it's always better to buy during a bear market than a FOMO market ;)
@_date: 2018-06-01 08:50:40
It makes sense to diversity in stocks because there are different sectors and industries and you don't have the inside knowledge of the companies. It makes little sense to diversify with crypto since crypto is supposed to be open source. You can look everything up. If you're gonna invest $100K, it is worth to invest your time to find out which crypto is most secured, censorship-resistance, decentralized, and network effect. IMO, Bitcoin trumps everything. I don't think EOS and ETH will survive long term. P.s: I used to own and shill for ETH.

Someone could set up 6000 fake btc1 nodes as well but there are only 250 btc1 nodes.
You DO have a say with your non mining node(s).  UASF proved that. NYA was just miners and businessEs trying to save face.  If it were just up to mining nodes making the decisions, I would never have invested in bitcoin in th first place.  Miners are incentivized to go with thr chain with the most economic activity, not the chain with most hash power.  If profits and price follow hash power, then why do miners choose to stick with bitcoin when it’s contentious?  They could invest hash power somewhere else if hash power determine the price.

Before the Aug HF, I would have agreed with you.  However, I now strongly against it.  Bitcoin changes must not be achieved via a political decision. We will have one political decision after another.  Bitcoin changes should be on technical merits only.  It’s slow and somewhat painful. It’s a feature not a bug.  What is the technical merit behind S2X? None! For bitcoin to be truly decentralized, it must be freed from political whim.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:33:21
Exactly. These non mining nodes are run by regular folks like you and I.  So let’s say this group comprising of miners and businesses with over 90% hash power decide to implement protocols whose economic incentives don’t align with regular bitcoin users (ie removing the 21M hard limit), you would support it because they have 90% hash power? This is no different than fiat currency where it’s controlled by a small group of ppl.  That’s why non mining nodes are so important.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:53:24
To Schiff, gold is valuable because it has utility in that it can be made into jewelry. Bitcoin is valuable andhas utility for its decentralization, censorship resistance and security, and frictionless and borderless payment. I couldn't give a shit whether bitcoin can be made into jewelry or not.  I could travel with $10M worth of bitcoin to another country, not with gold. Schiff's view on what is intrinsically value is different than mine.

Shiller is correct that there is exuberance in bitcoin.  However, it's not all irrational.  Speculators who have little knowledge of bitcoin buying bitcoin hoping to get rich quick is irrational exuberance.  My exuberance is rational.  I buy bitcoin because due to its decentralization, security, utility, and how it can free the people from oppressive govt and bankers.  Venezuelans buying bitcoin for survival not to get rich quick (not irrational exuberance).   Shiller making a statement on bitcoin without understanding the technology is irrational.

@_date: 2017-05-23 16:26:48
Exactly.  Miners must not have control.  They want big blocks so they can make more money through fees at the expense of the users.  They want all transactions on the main chains which is slow, not instantaneous and expensive, therefore, not ideal for buying coffee; and not to mention increases centralization.  
It's ok for Miners and blockstream to be selfish.  However, miners selfishness conflict with users' interest and increased centralization. the users benefit (for now) with blockstream acting in its self interest, therefore, i see no issue.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:42:08

Because they are  the one with the solution with cheap and instantaneous transactions for now.  There will be other players jumping in eventually with similar products so sidechains are not exclusive to blockstream.  
Main chain is slow and not instantaneous.  It should be used as a settlement layer, not for small transactions (i.e paying for cofee).

@_date: 2017-05-23 14:47:12
I can see how you can perceive it as COI but I don't see it as that way.  It's a sidechain.  The main blockchain is decentralized and that's what is important. The power is still in the hand of the users, not blockstream. The users will bail if they see that blockstream is making bitcoin as a whole more centralized.

@_date: 2017-05-31 17:10:33
No. Bitcoin without cheap and lightning fast transactions is shitcoin.  People will move to other coins (i.e ethereum, Litecoin).  Bitcoin without segwit and LN will eventually lose network effect and first mover advantage and we are starting to see that already.  The people will take a stand and it is 1 August.

If you're going to buy now, then buy and HODL for the long term. Don't be afraid of the 20-30% drop because the market will correct itself eventually.  In the long term, i believe it will go up.

It depends on what the resolution is as well. If the resolution is bitcoin without Segwit and more centralization (miners controlled), then it will get gradually replaced.  I won't be sticking around. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:07:58
Unfortunately china can't do shit about it.  Cryptos are d centralized and not in any govt control.  
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:07:11
It's probably gonna get worse until August 1st or until we can determine which direction bitcoin is headed.  If there is a split, then bitcoin would very likely take a free fall.  Not just bitcoin but all every cryptos out there.  
Imo, if bitcoin is heading to a more decentralized bitcoin, the price goes up.  Bitcoin is more decentralized (miners have more power), big drop.  Split, really really bad stuff.

For me it's simple, I cannot support bitcoin that is in the control of the miners. So if UASF fails, I'm done with non-segwit bitcoin.  I'll be moving to other cryptos that I think would be better than non-segwit bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:50:26
Mark Cuban thinks it's a bubble because he is questioning the valuation of bitcoin. I read an article that bitcoin literally saved a family in Venezuela from starvation due to the failure of its national currency and the difficulty of transferring money using other fiat currency. How do you put a valuation on that? 
Mark is a brilliant guy but he needs to stop thinking bitcoin worth like stock or as a person living in a stable economy.  Put himself in the shoes of everyday Venezuelan.

Miners are very critical to bitcoin. I couldn't agree more. they miss the important point - legacy bitcoin can't compete with other cryptos. Legacy bitcoin is the myspace.

Wow.  This is huge! Bitcoin is gradually getting worldwide adoption.  
Off topic: we need segwit and LN now for cheap transactions!!
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:21:48
I'm a BIP148 supporter and I know it's rush and reckless. I know I lack the technical background to fully grasp what will happen come Aug 1st.  For me it comes down to not having miners dictating what the direction of bitcoin so they can make $ from high fees at the expense of the users.  The reason segwit isn't activated via SF yet is because of Asicboost. 
You think grabbing some bitcoin sub $1K and thinking it will go up eventually? Maybe or maybe not. Why buy legacy bitcoin when there is better cryptos out There? Litecoin has segwit and eventually LN. It's better than bitcoin now but it doesn't have The network effect. Eventually it will because it's superior to legacy bitcoin.

Legacy bitcoin is not an option (no segwit and LN). Legacy bitcoin will be the myspace of the crypto world. So this is it - pedal to the medal and remove the steering wheel.  I won't say how much bitcoin I have but it's a sizeable amount for me. And I really really hate UASF btw.

@_date: 2017-06-17 13:19:53
This is why we need segwit a year ago. This is why we can't let miners dictate the direction of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:35:02
I'm on the same boat. I hate BIP148 because it's contentious and could cause a split. However, I only see two choices now: segwit with BIL148 or Jihancoin.  I think the choice is pretty obvious.  I'm riding the BIP148-mobile at full speed without the steering wheel. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:04:51
No. Just no.

@_date: 2017-06-04 10:42:46
It will eventually take over bitcoin in network effect if segwit is not activated.  
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:38:10

@_date: 2017-06-04 15:48:42
I'm hodling through August 1st as well. It's a significant risk because if the chain splits, bitcoin price will plummet.  If BIP148 fails and we still have thr legacy chain, then I will divest a significant portion to cryptos that I think are better than legacy bitcoin.  Legacy bitcoin can't compete with other cryptos and will eventually lose its network effect.  
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:57:04
So you think you're an expert on day trading based on 4-month result? Lol. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:15:15
The funny thing is I agree with you that BIP 148 is completely insane because of how risky it is. I think bitcoin is at crossroad where it is no longer about the technical. It is now about who get to determine path of bitcoin: Users or Miners (particularly Bitmain).  Come August 1st, if there is no path for Segwit, then bitcoin is done as the dominant crypto. Litecoin (or some other coins) will gradually chip away bitcoin's network effect. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:17:09
Keep the same one because you have already verified that it works.  keep your seeds in a secure place. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:28:06
It's sad that it has come to thisbut I'm on the same boat. I'm not cleared what will take place on Aug 1st but it seems to me BIP148 is the only option.  If we don't get segwit bitcoin, I'm done with bitcoin.  I'm heavily invested in bitcoin as well.  
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:17:29
