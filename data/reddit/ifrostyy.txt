Diversify.

Just for clarification. When I'm looking at GDAX candle, I'm basically watching the buy orders against the sell orders?

It has intrinsic value because of a few factors, at least to my understanding at this point. 
First being that there is a finite amount. As we know, valuable metals such as gold/silver get there value for the same reason; there's a finite amount of them. Science tells us how much gold/silver there is on Earth thus we know the intrinsic value. Finding and mining those precious metals didn't come free though. Just think on the process of mining. It's not cheap to mine precious metals. Money was the fuel.
Same is true for Bitcoin. It costs money to mine. Money in the form of energy and electricity via computers solving the complex cryptographs. The very act of you buying the coins fuels the mining process via electricity in computation. Thus getting an intrinsic value from the "work" being done. Essentially value = work.

It's you money man. All I'm gonna say is I wish I had that money to throw around in this game

Calling it a peak is like saying the bottom of the mountain is the top simply because the clouds are blocking your view of the summit.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:15:10
Bought another $1000. Y do I do dis 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:09:19
I like it so much it hurts

Bought my fair share of bean and cheese dip today. Can only afford so much :p
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:31:53
Just further cements skepticism on BCH imo
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:22:54
Yeah cause Reddit represents the whole market /s 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:47:49
Someone bought again 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:41:50
Some whale stalling the market by selling $1500 every 3 seconds
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:06:58
Useful, thank you.

Fiat currencies are the bubble. I mean it's called inflation. What happens when you over inflate? The bubble pops. I'm looking at you US dollar.

The price would eventually correct to it's true value again after people buy the coins they sell.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:00:47
This. Bump
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:29:00
Just depends on how quickly people buy them up. Since this is global I wouldn't suspect long. Remember there is a finite amount, so once all the coins are "owned" the price will plateau. The act of being finite gives it intrinsic value; like gold or silver. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:55:33
Bought some dip
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:02:44
gotta risk it to get the biscuit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:48:14
It's not an attack. Someone bought a couple racks worth yesterday and we're gonna see a correction until his transfer clears
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:41:00
You should look into how many coal plants have been shut down world wide in the last year. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:18:10
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:01:33
It has intrinsic value, you just don't understand why.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:15:27
No i man can't fight the true slope. I'm hodling stronk brother man bill 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:08:00
Cant fight it much longer 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:14:22
I'll buy your coins 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:43:40
Let me get some of that spice plsty

Probably not for a while. The hype only just started with normies and such.

Why is Jack Dorsey saying that coinbase btc are fake? I mean I can take them off and send them to my ledger? I'm confused 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:27:14
I think people are more willing to diversify into alts when their portfolios are in the green 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:26:33
Charge it to the game. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:07:15
I welcome the Vegeta memes if it comes to that 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:41:24
When Vegeta 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:19:03
Didn't it get lower than this a month ago? ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:14:34
That all depends on the coins. Shit coins will shit eventually. Research the coins. Read the white papers. Learn about what you're intending to invest in and evaluate whether or not you believe it has a future in the market space. 
I think alt coins have the potential to get you stronger gains then just getting btc alone, but also you risk stronger losses potentially with alts
