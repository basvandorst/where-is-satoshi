Who are the blockchain forensic companies you're working with atm?
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:06:07
You could rebroadcast that 089282391cbb03f61485edced351b557f2974a4a3f2fac70bd5c89a1dfcb1ca4 tx with a higher fee.

When will you be starting to process withdrawals? BTC and ETH blockchains still show your cold wallets with unchanged balances.
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:18:19
Sorry, just realized the 1 kBTC tx earlier this day from the 33kBTC cold wallet was used for withdrawals now.

If customers face losses, please keep the lost btc segregated within people that held btc and don't mix the losses with people holding LTC, ETH or USD.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:29:21
The time you have taken to settle the trades and balances is still reasonable but at the same time one could think you're just stalling and maybe nothing ever comes of this and people lose all their money.
You could do something to assure people you're progressing. Maybe make a thread and reveal the methodology you're thinking of settling trades and distributing losses. Also you could select a handful of redditors that would get their balances checked and their losses assessed in the scenario you're looking at the moment.

My ETH withdrawal just went through. Thank you!
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:59:26
Thank you Zane, I think this is the best way to move forward.

I was lending most of my USD at the time, does the fate of that money differ from USD that was just sitting on your exchange?
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:39:02
In other breaking news: water is wet.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:37:25
You put a too small fee on this TX... 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:45:37
I know it fair to give access to everyone at the same time, the suggestion was to give a few people access to their proposed losses so they could confirm you had progressed and this all isn't just smoke and mirrors.
I don't mean to offend by saying that but long wait times make people increasingly paranoid. Including me, lol.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:27:32
Well at least I'm seeing more traffic on the blockchain from your cold wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:22:59
I can live with losing 60%, don't know about 100%...
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:04:48
Is it true that you had 210k BTC of which 120k BTC was stolen and you now have 90k BTC left? Making the loss of btc about 57%.
\- edit -
This is second hand information supposedly from Giancarlo of Bitfinex.

Hey, I got this message on my withdrawal page and I only changed the password when prompted earlier this week:
"Your account is currently on withdrawal hold. All withdrawals will be held in a Pending Approval state until the hold is lifted. The most common triggers of a withdrawal hold are account password changes and the changing of certain security settings. Please contact support with questions or concerns. This hold will be lifted at August 13, 2016 05:05."
Can you look into this?
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:56:21
Thanks for your work, you didn't get much sleep at all...
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:37:44
I bought BTC with all my USD on bfx and shorted on Kraken. Now I dont know how long the withdrawal will take for that big amount.
Would be good to know a rough ETA at least for my withdrawal.
Otherwise I might need to cancel the current BTC withdrawal and make a smaller one, but then my withdrawal would take a longer time again...

Well... you didn't, Johnson is a pot head trying to be a libertarian but failing miserably.
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:51:35
agree, wish everyone would take the emu seriously
@_date: 2015-05-05 11:40:21
1337 or 1750 usd hasnt been the highest price sold on an exchange. There was the spike on btc/eur on btc-e last year that cleaned out a bot operator of his money. The high on that was 3200 eur per btc. See chart: 
And that one actually had volume. Bitcoin.de also had 1381 eur per btc ^ ^
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:19:18
Oh my god, okcoin.com went to 1% within bfx's price (now standing at 2.8% spread), I guess they're a ponzi too!!! /halflogic

Why is anyone upvoting your post? You guys havent done much calculus? There's maybe 370-400 keys there...
You can fit couple thousand txs in a block atm, so this will "surely" clog up the network ;)
Seems there's a reason I don't hang around much here, this place could come second place in the Darwin awards, defeated only by the champion that is YT comments...

Ooh, I see what you did there....

Why is it every time a deluded buttcoiner sees a corporate blockchain that their opinion magically flips 180 degrees and blockchain tech is suddenly worse than legacy systems.
How on earth do you rationalize that in your mind? XD
Maybe you should be a bit more rational in your thinking like BitttBurger.

Nah, GA is just a liar.

While the halving was expected to have an effect, the biggest contributor to that rally was the chinese "investment club" that funneled 20% of the total LTC supply through one address.

And all corporations trust each other. Got it, they dont need no stinking blockchains! :V

Less than 1% is plenty? lulz
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:49:25
Great point, one which I havent seen before.
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:45:03
I think he's referring to Troll Math™, a lesser known field of study in the same vein as Troll Physics™. Troll math theorizes you can crack the private key of any public crypto message by smoking a doobie and singing kumbayaa.

lol, not sure if even Zoinky believes that
