Hi there!
We do require a scan of EITHER a national identification card, passport or a driving license.
We do not require at any moment a utility bill and we will never ask for you to send us money if there's an additional verification process you must go through so your money will never be locked.
I hope this answerers your questions!

Hi cryptogalactic! I'm sorry to hear about the troubles with your recent order. As you've experienced first hand, Simplex is currently under heavy load which is causing some orders to be delayed much more than we'd like. I'm happy that everything was eventually solved, but I completely get how frustrating that process must have been for you.
For what it's worth, we've added another processor that handles orders in seconds rather than hours or days. If you shoot us an email, one of our Happiness Heroes will make sure that any future orders goes through them.
Until then, have a wonderful day :)
