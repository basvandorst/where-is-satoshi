You could look up NuBits, Bitshares, Tether, and look up other projects that aim to deliver stable crypto currencies.
There's a lot of discussion around these topics, and I think a stable crypto currency will be valuable, though alsace see the role for constrained supply crypto currencies.

I have a transaction stuck for over 24 hours when a $7 or so fee was paid by an exchange.
I want to use a crypto-currency that is cheaper &amp; faster than a bank, and Bitcoin currently isn't delivering.
Bitcoin performing badly is why we need a blocksize increase now, and when other solutions work out, the blocksize can stop being increased.
This attitude of thinking terrible performance is fine is why Bitcoin has lost so much market share in the last year, and I'm sure it'll continue if scaling doesn't happen quickly &amp; sensibility.

It's technology. If a technology falls behind the curve, it'll be superceded.
The Bitcoin community largely seems happy to fail to keep up with demand or providing a good service.
We'll see how that ends up in a few years time, but my bet is that crypto-currencies that provide good service &amp; good value will beat Bitcoin if it remains expensive, slow, and unresponsive.

Attacked by a forked coin? You mean, some people forked Bitcoin. It's not an attack, it's a 'split in the road' with no backwards compatibility.
When the community of a blockchain project has a fundamental disagreement on direction, that is what blockchains can do. It's not 'attacking', it's diverging.

Necessary for the long term success of Bitcoin in my opinion.
Of course not necessary for my life, but that's not what someone normally means when they say a solution is required for a technology etc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:34
I wanted a solution in good time so I didn't end up with a transaction stuck for 2+ days when I had plans of what to do with my Bitcoin.
In a more general sense, Steam &amp; other merchants did start adopting Bitcoin as a payment method, and are now stopping its usage because fees are so ridiculous.
I had bought things on steam with Bitcoin. I had bought beer with Bitcoin. I bought things from Amazon with Bitcoin via Purse. I can no longer use Bitcoin to buy anything or transfer value because it's so much worse than other options.
Seing Bitcoin becoming useless at what it was created to do (p2p digital cash) is annoying. Thankfully Bitcoin started something that others will take forward to mainstream uses even if Bitcoin its self fails to deliver.
From 90% to under 50% market share in 1 year should be a wake up call for the Bitcoin community, but instead many just think others are daft for complaining that Bitcoin is unnecessarily slow &amp; expensive.

That's a shame. Perhaps it doesn't make sense for the kinds of products overstock sell, but I wish a few companies around the world I've used recently received Bitcoin, as it would have been a fair bit cheaper, faster, and easier than international bank transfers, or Transferwise etc (though transferwise are pretty good!).
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:13:11
I could see a drop in the short term due to a delay in people re-buying, and some not re-buying. 
I'd imagine that in the longer term, the more useful Bitcoin becomes, the more people will use it, and the more people will be happy holding it due to increased utility.
The best thing will be when it grows to the point where retailers pay suppliers &amp; staff in Bitcoin.  If this kind of critical mass of adoption is reached, the upward price pressure will be enormous!

Indeed, though my worry is that the 2 are related. Why has this bug in the reference wallet persisted for years if there is nothing in the protocol that makes it a hard thing to avoid?
Bitstamp's quick resolution to this gives me hope that it was just something that wasn't a priority for the developers working on the reference wallet, as they didn't foresee how the bug could be exploited as it has been.

He's talking about the supply of Bitcoin for sale on exchanges.  If holders decide to spend their holdings, and the merchant sells those Bitcoins for USD, the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges will rise, putting downward pressure on the price.
I suspect that most users replenish their holdings after spending, and not all merchants sell all BTC, so the impact of merchants on the price of Bitcoin is uncertain.
It's only the supply and demand at exchanges that affect the price of Bitcoin, and only a fraction of all held Bitcoin is on exchanges.
For example, if 10% of all Bitcoin were held on exchanges, and there was an 18% rise in supply but static demand, you would see a huge drop in price even without a drop in demand, as there has been a 180% increase in supply at exchanges.  
This is why I'm saying that there hasn't necessarily been a drop in demand, even though there is a possibility that there has been.

You can get any cards that best suit your need. But, many cards do have high charges for overseas use, giving a possible advantage to using Bitcoin.

Real Bitcoins were not forged; MtGox's database was hacked.
The reason they are un-forgeable is because of the blockchain.  If you can't see coins on the blockchain, then of course someone could be reporting 'fake' Bitcoins, but that's not forging Bitcoins, but forging the records of an exchange.  Quality exchanges now use a blockchain based proof of reserves to let people trust that their database isn't faking their Bitcoin deposits.

What real world occurrences have you used to prove that Bitcoin would not be performing better with higher price stability &amp; no deflationary nature?
I don't see the inherent price instability of Bitcoin as a huge problem whilst Bitcoin is complimentary to fiat, but if Bitcoin were to be a primary currency, the instability would cause problems for pricing goods, and wouldn't be suitable for those who want a stable store of value for wealth they want to store with minimal risk.
I'm sure other cryptocurrencies will emerge to play these roles, but to say that Bitcoin's deflationary &amp; unstable nature is no problem because of its success so far doesn't sound like winning an argument to me.
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:34:44
It is definitely an impediment.  NuBit is well worth a look - it's got a very short (but very good) track record at tracking the USD very closely. 
If the option of high stability was easy, crypto-currency could certainly gain momentum more quickly for general use.

It's quite an effort &amp;amp; investment, but if there were a convincing business model &amp;amp; advantage, it may be possible to set up a new MVNO that is open to being paid in Bitcoin, and also converting credit from other topup means (any ATM, supermarket checkout, top up card from shop) into Bitcoin. 
If this MVNO then also set up in other countries, it could offer cheap &amp;amp; fast international payments between its subscribers without needing public addresses etc. 
There are many more possibilities with this model, but it'd need to generate sufficient revenue from these to make it work (which I think would be possible).

How many Bitcoin users don't replenish their stock of Bitcoin after buying something? 
I don't think we can answer that question at the moment (don't know if anyone's researched it?), but if generally people replenish their stocks, or even buy back a bit more than they spent, you might find that a merchant sale exerts an upward pressure on the Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2014-12-10 08:29:01
If anything replaces Bitcoin, it could be something like NuBits (or a development of that concept), as it offers stability, and democratises money by enabling shareholders to vote on what happens with the proceeds of new coin issuance.
Currently, the banking sector is the biggest beneficiary of 'seigniorage', which is the profit from creating new money, and lots of people aren't happy with how banks have been behaving with their privileged position. 
NuBits takes that benefit from the banks and gives it to the currency users &amp; system shareholders who can vote for how the proceeds of new money creation are spent (this may have appeal beyond techies).
Nothing will replace Bitcoin as the primary crypto-currency unless it's made easy to use, and even then, Bitcoin may still grow significantly, even if it gets overtaken by another crypto-currency for general use. 
There are many more non-bitcoin users than there are Bitcoin users, so appealing to the existing user base is less important than reaching the general consumers &amp; savers, who probably want ease of use, high stability, and maybe democratic control rather than miner control.
We'll see how it all pans out :)

No - it's easier to get verified with a bitcoin exchange than get a credit card, and a lot of people have credit cards.
If there is sufficient benefit to users, scanning a couple of documents will never be a big problem for bitcoin adoption.
I haven't seen the video yet, but you can't use a normal ATM without first opening a bank account, which is harder than buying Bitcoins.
I agree in questioning the effectiveness of AML procedures, but concluding they are completely pointless &amp;amp; ineffective doesn't seem to be correct according to comments from people with experience.
Edit: seen some of the video, and yes, it's annoying &amp; would turn people away, so Robocoin's implementation isn't great/practical. 
Who opens a bank account from an ATM anyway?  And who would buy significant amounts of bitcoin with cash?  Seems a bit mad, but thankfully there are far easier ways to get bitcoin!

In case you haven't realised, in the era of fiat money, humanity has escaped poverty &amp; increased prosperity at an unprecedented rate.  People have become richer whilst using fiat, so they do think it works, because it does. 
It's certainly not perfect, and the banks do benefit far more than they should from the setup, but people aren't dumb for using fiat.
Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming a real alternative to fiat, but currently only for the techies &amp; visionaries.

Bitcoin will be great for remittance when there's a healthy &amp; accessible market for Bitcoin in the country where funds are being transferred to. 
It'll be even better when your employer pays a proportion of your salary in Bitcoin, so the only cost will be when selling Bitcoin for local currency.
How long this takes will depend on your country &amp; employer, but there's a lot of activity in the Bitcoin space, so I'd imagine that in 2-3 years the situation will be far better, assuming regulators are supportive.  
If regulators &amp; banksare oppressive, then exchanging between Bitcoin &amp; fiat will always be expensive.

I think it's 3x redundancy online at any one time, so as soon as 1 of 3 goes offline, the chunk with only 2 copies online will be replacated onto another online node increasing copies to 3.  The chances of 3 nodes dissappearing in such a short time frame that the shared chunk can't be duplicated  should be tiny.  If they rank nodes to ensure at least 1 of 3 are highly reliable nodes, the chances of loss reduce even more, so I'd be surprised if 99.99% availability wasn't surpassed once the network is well established.

I like peer to peer lending, but denominating loans in Bitcoin while the price is unstable is such an obviously bad idea.
If the price of Bitcoin drops over the loan period, the lender loses out.
If the price of Bitcoin increases over the loan period, the borrower loses out.
Have you thought about these scenarios?  If so, what is your solution? 
The only way I can think of this working is if Bitcoin is only used to facilitate transfer of value from the lender to the borrower, but loans should be denominated in BTC.

Most people who buy items in Bitcoin aren't likely to 'cash out' of Bitcoin by buying items, but re-buy at least what they've spent, which counters the downward pressure from the merchant cashing out.
I don't know if anyone has researched how many Bitcoin spenders cash out when spending, and how many replace their Bitcoin stock.   I could be wrong, but suspect the majority will re-stock, so Amazon accepting Bitcoin shouldn't be bad for the price, but rather reinforce Bitcoin as a real currency &amp; enhance its usefulness.

To use a paper wallet as cash you can hand to someone, the holder would need to verify that they can access the private key, and know that nobody else could have access to it.  I don't know how you'd do that, but if a way was found, then this could work.  
If you used a traditional paper wallet with both keys on, someone could photograph the keys &amp; spend it later.
If you were happy to trust a third party issuer, you could have paper wallets that have an encrypted private key on, and to 'redeem' the Bitcoins, you send it to the issuer, who then sends the BTC to your bitcoin address &amp; destroys that paper wallet. Unredeemed wallets could be verified &amp; used as cash.

Banks are certainty not perfect (far from it), and I'm sure some have facilitated organised crime to some degree, but I think they would have done so on a far bigger scale without regulation &amp; scrutiny.
People who want to will still have the choice to use Bitcoin unregulated (as you say, the Gov can't stop that - which is good), but some regulation could help open up Bitcoin to a far bigger audience (e.g. So banks don't close down accounts involved in BTC). It's just part of mainstream acceptance, which I see as good.

I think it's important to count the tie in of the coin-based tokens - from a crypto-currency perspective, isn't it quite an innovation to have:
- many of transactions per second
- near instant confirmations
- no 51% attack risk
- proof of resource base, rather than proof of work (more useful than mining calculations)
I don't know technically how all this is supposed to work, but these are claims being made on their blogs &amp;amp; web site if I remember correctly.

I'm pretty sure a if you're storing something for a period of time, you want to find the same thing when you get it out of storage.
If you store 100 units of value for a year, and on retrieving it find only 50 units, the store has not successfully stored the value.
More stable store of value = better store of value.
High volatility = bad store of value, so Bitcoin is currently not a good store of value. 
This is why I find bitsharesx (BitUSD etc) very interesting. If it works, it can be a great store of value, whilst keeping the many benefits of Bitcoin as a crypto-currency, and is easily exchangeable with Bitcoin.

Well, Bitcoin (and other crypto-currency) can be part of the solution, if by solution we're talking about independence from dodgily run government currency systems.

He is either stupid, or trolling to get attention.
I was considering posting a comment, but to sign up for an account you have to agree to receive marketing emails from the company who runs ZDnet, so I didn't bother.
If he's intelligent enough to write for ZDNet, you'd think he'd understand that the reply from the senator in no way agrees with his stance that Bitcoin is illegal - only that it is not legal tender.
To quote:
"Currency is legal tender recognized by the federal government. In other words, if the federal government does not disperse or remit cryptocurrencies, they are simply not legal currency. If the IRS were to accept bitcoin as tax payment or if Congress were to appropriate bitcoins, then a constitutional conflict would exist under Article I Section 8 Clause 5"
This clearly says that with current use, Bitcoins aren't illegal, though not legal tender.  If they were to become legal tender, he thinks a conflict would exist.  In all likelihood, any conflict would be resolved by paving the way for Bitcoin to be used to pay taxes, if that's what people &amp; the government wanted.
I can't think of why he's so strongly anti-cryptocurrency, and guess it's just a ploy to get people to read his articles &amp; sign up for marketing emails.

You assume that less than 95% of customers are using Bitcoin.  I was talking about a hypothetical situation where a higher percentage of users are already transacting in bitcoin, which changes the dynamics.
You're also assuming that this would be an individual merchant acting alone, rather than a trend in an industry over time, which isn't likely to be the case.
Whether through increased credit card prices, or discounted Bitcoin prices, the principle is that the costs to merchants of accepting payment in Bitcoin are lower than accepting credit cards, so it makes sense for their pricing to reflect this, as it incentivises more consumers to use the method that saves the merchants money.
Saving money &amp; making profit is a shared agenda amongst many merchants.

If your scenario came to pass, the price of Bitcoin would be rising all the time from now until full world domination, and at a fairly rapid rate.
Do you think people want to re-price goods &amp; services and adjust their reference for the value of things every few days or weeks?
You're right that if Bitcoin did achieve full world domination / full saturation, it would become stable.  
At that point the deflation of goods/services prices would reduce to around the level of global economic growth, which would be manageable, and similar to current fiat inflation, but prices going down, not up.
However, the journey to that point could take many years, in which pricing items in Bitcoin won't make sense.
I expect something along the lines of BitUSD, which targets stability relative to USD to be used for pricing in Crypto-currency (though BitUSD its self seems to have failed).  If someone wants to pay with Bitcoin, it should be dead easy, just the pricing in Bitcoin won't be ideal.

Bitcoin is never likely to change its basic properties, so will likely never have a dynamic supply model that can respond to changes in demand.  This will lead to inherent instability &amp; therefore will never be an ideal currency for pricing items &amp; people using it to value things. 
Bitcoin may be the gold of the crypto currency world, but it won't generally be the cash due to stability being a key property for cash (e.g. not doubling / halving in value within a few nonths, with the constant need for new pricing labels &amp; no relarively fixed idea of what a bitcoin can buy).

We don't have the data to say for certain what the majority of people do with their Bitcoin stock when they make a purchase with Bitcoin, which is very important when trying to judge the impact an increase in merchant sales in Bitcoin has on the Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin's price remaining the same over the next 6 years would be a strong indicator that it's having far less growth than I'd like to see, so I'd be quite disappointed. 
Bitcoin has loads of potential, and if this is realised, then demand will be much greater than it is today, and supply only a bit bigger, so price should be much higher. 
However, Bitcoin may be the catalyst for other crypto-currencies who take crypto-currency to places Bitcoin can't or won't.   In this case, Bitcoin's price could remain the same, but crypto-currency could surge forward in another guise. 
It's the crypto-currency technologies that I want to see having a massive impact on the world, so whether it's Bitcoin or not isn't that important to me, though as the pioneer, I'd like to see Bitcoin innovate, adapt, and grow to having a far greater impact on the world than it had had so far.  If it does this, the price will not remain at $300-$400.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:53:07
Absolutely. Bitcoin isn't particularly suitable as a transactional currency due to possible double spends prior to confirmations (which are slow), maximum of 7 transactions per second (which is tiny), and volatility means pricing in BTC isn't sensible.
I hope Bitcoin devs can overcome these issues soon, or that a 'transactional' crypto currency comes along &amp; creates the 'crypto cash' to Bitcoin's 'crypto gold'.
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:51:11
Bitcoin may never be suitable for pricing items whilst it's still growing (which may be for many years).
Having a practically fixed supply + changing demand will not result in a stable value suitable for pricing.
BTC has a purposefully inflexible supply, so is destined to be fairly unstable unless demand somehow stabilises, which is hard to imagine.
I don't think it's about age or maturity - any young currency could have a fairly stable value if its supply were flexible enough to match demand, but Bitcoin isn't designed like this, so why expect it to behave like it is?

You could be more condescending and arrogant, but it wouldn't be easy.
Maybe you're right and merchants don't want to use Bitcoin &amp; wouldn't save any money by accepting it.
If that's the case, BitPay, CoinBase etc should all be rapidly losing momentum &amp; failing to sign up new merchants, and there would be no examples of merchants offering discounts to those paying in Bitcoin.
In reality, BitPay etc are expanding rapidly and various companies (Tigerdirect, Newegg, Dell) have offered discounts to those paying in Bitcoin.
Yes I use my imagination to think about how things might be if Bitcoin really does grow and Bitpay / Coinbase continue on their current growth trajectory, as it's not simply common sense what the impact of that change may be.  
How can you consider the future of a disruptive technology without using imagination?

One problem I see with this as an argument against the view that deflation can be harmful is that the sharpest deflation in Switzerland happened in 2008 and 2011, which coincides with an increase in the rate of unemployment, indicating that the sharper deflation could be linked to a reduction in employment. 
I'm not saying that deflation is always terrible, but this example doesn't seem to do what the article suggests.
Are there examples of sustained deflation along with sustained economic growth &amp; no growth in unemployment?

As the person from New Zealand said - Bitcoin behaves more like a commodity than cash.
If you don't see any value of or use for a highly stable store of value (comparable to cash), or comprehend why people might want such a property in their money, then we won't find agreement here.
I think there will he demand for a high-stability crypto-currency that will compliment Bitcoin in the crypto-currency space.  It remains to be seen whether this can be done, and if so, exactly what role it will play.
My overall point (why I replied to the original comment) is that it can make rational sense to believe that a future crypto-currency could do things that Bitcoin can't, and if those things enable more widespread use as a cash substitute, it could be a 'bigger threat' to cash than Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:27:07
What economic models of Bitcoin show that its fixed supply will cause a problem?  The underlying conditions of a Bitcoin monetary system are very different to a fiat system like we're used to, so the reasons why deflation is a big issue outside of Bitcoin doesn't necessarily make it as big a problem within a Bitcoin economy. 
Deflation may be bad in a normal fiat economy because money supply growth is directly linked to bank lending quantity, and if bank lending is contracting to a degree that causes deflation, it means a reduction in investment &amp; consumption, which hurts the economy.
In a bitcoin economy, deflation doesn't need to have any correlation with investment or consumption levels. In fact, if investment &amp; consumption are on the up, demand for bitcoin would rise &amp; increase deflationary pressure - quite different to the conditions for deflation in our current systems. 
I'm not saying there would be no problem with a fixed money supply, but I don't think you can assume that deflation in a bitcoin economy would indicate the same problems it does in a normal economy, as there are fundamental differences.
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:34:02
Perhaps the monetary system is imperfect when 97+ % of currency in circulation is earning interest for banks, who every year have an incentive to increase profits by producing a bit too much currency (by lending more), at the cost of 2-4% of all wealth in the economy (through the inflation this causes).
You're probably right that its the best system we've ever had: it's quite stable, it enables significant investment and credit lets people spread costs of big purchases over time. 
But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved, and a system that didn't require inflation that erodes wealth, and didn't have the financial sector as by far the biggest beneficiaries of the creation of new money would be an improvement.
Bitcoin probably is more well suited to being a store of value than a currency (though I wouldn't count it out completely yet), but I'm sure that a transactional crypto-currency based on similar technology can be made that has even better properties than the current government &amp; bank run system.
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:11:51
The author has an interesting concept of 'store of value' if they think that a volatile asset can be an excellent store of value.
Storage of value means to put a specific amount of value aside, and retain that specific value until it is needed (not increasing or decreasing in value).
It is Bitcoin's inability to do this that makes me believe that a specialist 'store of value' crypto-currency will have a place beside Bitcoin.
You're right that it's easy to pay x$ worth of Bitcoin for something, and I agree that this a great way of pricing things for people who hold &amp; pay with Bitcoin.
Crypto-currency is certainly here to stay, and I think the New Zealand central bank have a fair view that a crypto-currency that is a better store of value than Bitcoin could hold greater mass appeal than Bitcoin, but you may be right that prople will just be happy holding a more volatile asset, as long as its value tends upwards instead of downwards.
It'll certainly be fascinating to see how it all develops in the coming years :)

Bitcoin is a promising technology that can benefit savvy South Africans, but Bitcoin can't 'save' you from the terrible governance that threatens to turn South Africa into the next Zimbabwe, and the falling Rand is a symptom of this deeper problem.

Yes that is what I was initially arguing, and that point was clarified when I mentioned my narrower definition of prosperity. 
True, widespread prosperity was never seen in ancient Egypt.  You had a far worse distribution of income than today, with many living in abject poverty &amp; slavery, but the elites parasitically living the high lift off their backs.  That is not a high level of economic development compared to what we have today, though they were an advanced society for their time.

She's clearly not an expert on Bitcoin by any stretch of the imagination, and could have done some more research.   
Nevertheless, her tone is indearing towards Bitcoin, and this will get more attention towards Bitcoin, which is great.

I can see your point, and while democracy doesn't please everyone, it's better than many alternatives.

Absolutely: bitcoin volatility will be an indication of its success, as it has a fixed supply, its growth will cause volatility, but not just against other currencies, but also goods &amp; services.
We'll just need to wait and see how it plays out, but I wouldn't be surprised if some kind if inherently stable crypto-currency become the norm as crypto-cash.
This will be great for Bitcoin too, as the ultra-high liquidity of crypto-currencies make them so easily interchangeable that anyone who wants to can hold &amp; spend Bitcoin, and the transactional currency just enables the use of Bitcoin + useful price stability so we don't all need new price labels &amp; menus every few weeks.

If the insurer needs 1% of balances per year, they're accepting that there's a very small chance of loss. If there were 1 catastrophic loss in 100 years (for example, from a hack by malicious employees)  they would be out of pocket, so it doesn't seem that bad to me for those who need their big bitcoin balances to be fully insured against loss.

This is less tax, not more. They are legitimising Bitcoin as a private currency, and clarifying that VAT won't be due on buying &amp; selling Bitcoin, paving the way for scaling up UK exchanges &amp; other services.

NuBits &amp; Bitshares are interesting crypto-currency innovations from the last 40p days that deal with the volatility issue.
If that's what you mean by 'other alts', then you have a point about them disrupting Bitcoin.  I always think of crypto-currency as a whole when people talk about the disruptive potential of 'Bitcoin'.
It may be Bitcoin, or something else that makes a big impact, but I can't see how these fast developing technologies can fail to have a significant impact in the next decade &amp; beyond.

I read my comment again.  It seems fine.

It sounds valid, but you can now get mobile Internet in even the poorest countries.   
Granted, the poorest people there may not be able to afford it, but there are certainly many millions of people in poorer countries who have data enabled phones &amp; no banking services, who wouldn't mind being financially connected to the rest of the world.
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:56:37
You might be right. And I hope you're wrong.
Reputation means a lot, and if quality sellers take to open Bazaar due to lower fees, people will trust them.
This may take years, and some failures in between, plus optional insurance services (like ebay / paypal force on trustworthy transactions to cover the dodgy ones).
I think ease of use will be as important an even bigger issue than trust / insurance, and if these issues can be sorted, it should grow as it will save people money.

Yes, I think you're missing that the "Dividend Bitcoin Address" is an address submitted by a shareholder to receive dividends to, and they can also use that address for purposes other than receiving dividends from Neo &amp; Bee.
So there is no evidence that the payments are from Neo &amp; Bee unless you can see payments to that address that are definitely from Neo &amp; Bee. 
Unless I'm missing something :)

If nobody used Bitcoin or spent it, it would be pointless.  It's potential as a global payment system is what gives it value.
Looking at it another way, Bitcoin would be worthless as a currency if you could only buy them once &amp; not transact beyond that.
It could however be a token for proof of identity or something, but not a valuable currency - for that, people need to use it.
Saving is not particularly destructive, but the article seems to ignore the importance of the velocity of money within an economy.
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:16:00


That's something the merchants would need to balance. I'm pretty sure that if a single merchant hiked prices for credit card customers today, they'd lose out significantly, as Bitcoin isn't a viable alternative for many people.  But this may not be the case in a couple of years.


Reputation is not a small issue for merchants.  I've never had to do a chargeback to get a refund on a faulty product.  
If buying from untrusted merchants who don't care about reputation or customer service, the charge back facility of credit cards makes them more suitable than Bitcoin.

Seigniorage is the difference between the value of new money, and the cost to produce it, so Bitcoin certainly has seigniorage, and it's why many miners mine.

An exchange in the UK previously would have had to pay 20% VAT on any Bitcoins it sold, making them very uncompetitive. This will no longer be the case - VAT will only be on trade fees, not the entire amount.

Kind of, but exchange to buy bitcoins, or buy goods instead of fiat directly.
I think the rate needs to be set by the market, as who knows if it should be 7%, 3%, or - 2% (if more people want to spend BTC than buy BTC). 
If fraud stays low with this, it could have a lot of potential.
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:03:46
Dell accepting Bitcoin is far more likely to put upward pressure on price than downward.
Publicity, more places to spend Bitcoin, and acceptance by another big brand will put upward pressure on the Bitcoin price.
If people want to cash out of Bitcoin, they don't need to buy a Dell, or anything from any other merchant.
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:01:41
Absolutely - I think Bitcoin might be the 'reserve currency' of the crypto-currency world, like digital gold. 
I also think Bitcoin will always be accepted wherever other, potentially more widely used, crypto-currencies, are accepted, as it will be so easy to do so &amp; it will retain value.
Bitcoin will always be un-forgeable, instantly transferable, limited supply etc, and have a huge headstart on other crypto-currencies, so I don't see why it won't have a place for a long time, even if it's not the be-all and end-all of crypto-currency that some people here think it will always be.

Thanks - I think you might be right :)
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:44:23
I think the worst case scenario is a lot worse than that - if Bitcoin fails to innovate here, it could severely constrain growth, and open up opportunities for innovative new crypto currencies to gain traction due to technical superiority.  Eventually Bitcoin could lose its place as the primary Crypto, thus losing significant value.
This may not happen, but I see it as a possibility.
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:16:22
It's kind of both - yes, regulation is holding things up, as bitcoin companies can't operate as they'd like to due to that regulation.  However, clearing up uncertainties in the regulatory treatment of bitcoin will be beneficial in enabling companies to figure out how they operate.  
Perhaps less regulation overall would be better, but given the regulation that already exists, clarified regulation of Bitcoin could be beneficial to Bitcoin entrepreneurs.

People don't even need an exchange as such - just a customer for BTC.
If random companies based around Africa, who have Euro bank accounts wanted, they could buy Bitcoin at 2% less than market price, and immediately sell them on Bitstamp, then thansfer Euros to their account periodically, making nearly 2% return on very simple transactions.
If Bitcoin remittances became popular, I'm sure many companies would offer this service to make some extra cash, and competition would put downward pressure on the cost to recipients.
Would need to check regulations, but this could be a great business opportunity.

You seem happy trusting 'Bitcoin's FED'; the miners and their consensus, so why not trust NuBits miners, and their consensus?
As I understand it, if enough Bitcoin miners wanted to do something that you didn't like to the network, they can do it, and it would be the same with NuBits, but rather than a handful of powerful miners deciding on policy, it would be a massively distributed &amp; decentralised user base.
(Also, you may not be the target market for whatever crypto-currency is going to become the most widespread in general use by people who are quite different to the average r/bitcoin user.)

If Bitcoin becomes popular in Africa, it will only do so by African users benefiting by using it compared to the current options, e.g. Western Union / expensive Bank accounts.  So, it could be saving Africans money, and also see an increase in demand, leading to higher Bitcoin price &amp; giving Bitcoin holders more wealth.  In this case, everyone gains, only Western Union / expensive banks lose out.

Some people have vision &amp; determination.  Open Bazaar will work "soon".   Maidsafe will be up and running "soon".  Low volatility crypto-currency (NuBits, Bitshares) will be proven reliable "soon". 
These aren't vain hopes, but beta projects with committed teams.
A forward thinking community will be thinking ahead. 
As for "now" - if you can't see progress over the past couple of years in Bitcoin &amp; crypto-currency / technology, then you're not looking.
@_date: 2014-07-10 08:13:31
Bitcoin has brought many innovations, and its open nature means that there's room for the technology to be used in many ways. 
Many people in this community seem to reject any innovation that doesn't fit their narrow (but valid) vision of what this technology can achieve, or how it should be used.
Quite a few people actually want to use dollars, so technology that improves the use of dollars could actually be a good thing.  This doesn't threaten Bitcoin!
Let people have different visions. Let people experiment. Let people cater to different markets. Don't assume that it's useless because it's not your vision. 
Try to be even a bit open minded!

Very interesting concept &amp; vision.
If you could get an app like this, it could be great.  Even though the 30% loss to Google /apple would be annoying, some may use it for convenience, especially if the app has functionality that is worth $3. 
The functionality of the app without the bundled BTC would be critical to its success.
Well worth giving some thought to, as if a good enough concept were found, it shouldn't be too hard to do it.
Maybe a simple messaging app (you mentioned whatsapp), like others but with a built in tipping / payments / money sending features, plus Bitcoin tutorial so users can withdraw their balance once they have the required knowledge?
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:55:25
That, and the rate of dollar creation isn't anywhere near the level that would cause high inflation, let alone hyperinflation.   
Hyperinflation is caused by money supply growth far exceeding increased money demand, so basically printing money is needed, but thankfully isn't happening, so nor will hyperinflation.

It may not be difficult, but it's quite expensive and slow compared to Bitcoin transactions, so I'd be interested in any gateway that could undercut Western Union.

It seems like a bit of a scandal how the banks are all excluding Bitcoin companies from having accounts &amp; access to faster payments.  
They also seem to be blocking potential loopholes, like transferwise &amp; currencyfair from letting people send money to exchanges.

Bitcoin's price stability has little impact on cost savings, especially if the price trends up over time, and individuals maintain a set Bitcoin balance that they top up from Fiat to make purchases.
It is early days, but assuming Bitcoin saves money for merchants, it's not unlikely that they'll pass on some of the savings to incentivise consumers, hence providing a real cost saving. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:29:06
Perfume? Bread? Mountains? HTTP? Hedgehogs? The moon?  Is everything political?  
Bitcoin doesn't support any policies, partys or ideologies. It processes transactions &amp; adds them to the blockchain.
Anything can be used as a political tool, including Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean that it is political, even if its creators &amp; users are.  
Bitcoin is political as much as a knife is a sculptor, chef, or murderer.

If we didn't have a few political partys competing for voters by offering to spend more &amp; more, and had a collaborative &amp; stable political environment, perhaps the overspending situation could get better rather than worse.  If it got out of hand, the people could only blame themselves rather than having politicians as a scapegoat.
Can you think of how to prevent a democratic society overspending?
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:44:11
Bitcoin's code doesn't determine how markets work, and anything with a fixed supply cannot be responsive to changes in demand. 
Currencies always face changes in demand, and especially if they grow from being tiny, to being a significant player globally (which hopefully Bitcoin will).
Fixed supply is fundamental to Bitcoin, and that fundamentally leads to volatility.
Gold has a pretty big market cap, and is highly volatile.

It could work well, as built in payments could be a good differentiator from other messaging apps, but the app would need to be seriously good to compete, especially if it's paid for.
Bitcoin could either be hidden away &amp; handled centrally for those not used to handling crypto currencies, but full wallet control could be an option for those who want it, and funds could be topped up via Bitcoin to avoid app store charges.

The crypto-currency aspect would mean the funds can go anywhere in the world cheaply &amp; instantly with no useful trace.  
If laundering with a crypto-currency was dead easy &amp; risk free for criminals (as it would be with no AML processes in place), it would make crime more rewarding &amp; make it harder to catch criminals.  This in my mind is negative.
On another note, what exactly about a tiny bit of admin will stifle the growth of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:32:50
It would definitely benefit criminals trying to launder money if governments made no attempt to seek out suspicious financial transactions. 
If criminals could exchange limitless cash for BTC with no scrutiny, and limitless BTC for cash  with no scrutiny, it will make it almost effortless to launder money. 
Can you not see this, or would you be happy to give criminals a bit more slack to save a few minutes of admin on your part?
I know this argument won't work for extreme libertarians who want criminals to have free reign, but for most people, KYC rules are a small annoyance that probably play a significant role in detecting illicit activity.

At the moment, you could issue blockchain based tokens that represent a shareholding, but that won't make them legit shares - they'll still need to be registered through the authorities in your country. 
Ideally you could have an official shareholding that is legally assigned to the token holders, which may be possible, but they won't be able to trade them easily as full, centralised records of who the holders are will need to be kept, which negates most or all of the benefits of doing it on the blockchain.

Actually, it's something like 16-18% of the entire Bitcoin supply each year at the moment.
That is a pretty big fraction, and as a percentage of the Bitcoin supply available on exchanges (which set the price), It's massive.
This is important as I'd imagine that miners usually need to dump their mined coins to fund their operation.
If 5% of Bitcoins in existence were on exchanges, there may have been a trippling of the available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges over the past year, which is bound to have a huge impact on price.  This coupled with the popping of the huge bubble in late 2013 could explain a lot of the price movement.

I'm incredibly glad we've moved on from slavery, and thankfully it's been shown that slavery wasn't at all necessary for high levels of development (though I think that argument was used to try to perpetuate the slave trade).
I don't see low-wage labour as slavery, unless the workers are forced into it.
Banks and governments aren't the same as slavery, as they can both play positive roles in contributing to economic development without any imposition over others (people are free not to use banks, or in democracies, to vote out bad governments), and whilst we've seen prosperity without slavery, we've not yet seen prosperity without government or banks.
If the beneficial roles of government and banks can be replaced by new innovations that don't have some of the down sides, then great.

I know r/bitcoin hates to hear it, but stability is actually a good thing in a currency, and this shows why. 
I believe that the quest for stable crypto-currency is important, and BitShares &amp; NuBits are leading the way here.
I think Bitcoin has a role to play as a store of wealth, but for an everyday currency, this kind of price instability is not confidence inspiring.
I still think Bitcoin's price is likely to rocket again due to its inflexible supply and lots of speculators, but for general use I look forward to the emergence of high-quality, stable crypto-currencies.

You seem pretty closed minded to the concept from the beginning, and somehow see shareholders controlling the NuBits network as dangerous, but miners controlling BTC as no problem at all.
You also don't seem to see a difference between government control &amp; distributed democratic control.
It's wise to be cautious about NuBits, especially while it's closed source and so new, but I can  see the value in what they're aiming to achieve, so am interested from that perspective, even if it's not perfect.
You're very welcome to have nothing to do with NuBits, but saying it has 'all' attributes &amp; problems of a centralised system isn't accurate, as it has many of the advantages of a decentralised system.
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:53:30
When MaidSafe or similar appears, this will all be irrelevant, as the government can't tell distributed autonomous apps to hand over data, and they're very unlikely to try banning the use of them.
The UK government doesn’t plan to ban people using encryption themselves, but want a back door into messaging services etc, so the 'Cameron wants to ban encryption' thing is apparently an oversimplification of their position, even if what they actually want to do is also not ideal.

@_date: 2015-01-16 08:40:25
Which part isn't possible? 
Prevention of appreciation when demand increases or prevention of depreciation when demand drops?
Prevention of appreciation is obviously easy, and if this process builds up a reserve for each unit issued, then there's a big resource to help prevent depreciation when demand drops. 
If supply stops increasing when demand is reducing &amp; everyone knows the supply will not increase until demand recovers, plus there's a good ratio of reserves (say 50%),then you'd need a sell off of 50% of the money supply to cause depreciation, which won't happen if the currency is useful.
There are challenges is implementing a system like this, but I'd be interested to hear why you think it would be impossible.
Edit: relating to the swiss example, if a new swiss franks were issued for every euro exchanged, they would have stopped this temporary appreciation.

Assuming 'users' buy Bitcoin on exchanges, are they not also investors?

Yes.  It will be enforced through regulation.  I'm not sure exactly what their plans are, but I think they see depositors having a choice as to whether their bank can lend their funds out, and the banks will be limited to that amount.  I don't know if there would be a set reserve ratio of those depositor designated reserves, but it certainly won't be like today, where there isn't a set reserve ratio.


What Positive Money are talking about is directing the proceeds of money creation to democratically selected purposes, rather than delegating this to the banks, so it's more directly democratic.  There's a difference between something happening in a democracy, and something being democratic.


Everyone? Except the proponents of positive money &amp; similar concepts :)  
Society doesn't determine what the banks decide to create money for - the banks do .  This does make sense, as newly created money will only go into areas that are likely to generate a return, as that is in the bank's interest.
However, the banks have shown themselves to be irresponsible in handling this privilege, as many wouldn't even exist now if it weren't for taxpayer bailouts.  
Do you think it's in society's best interests to stop lending to businesses when there's a problem with the banking system?  The recent recession was largely caused by this (credit crunch), and probably isn't ideal.


Agreed.  I think that reforming democracy is at least as big a deal as reforming the monetary and financial system.


I agree that if a trustless system can be made that achieves an aim, then it's the least risky way of achieving that aim, as nobody can get in the way for whatever reason.
I also think that it may be possible to create a trustless crypto-currency that achieves the aims of Positive Money (or whatever the people democratically want), which would be an improvement.
But my point isn't that positive money is in any way perfect, but that it is significantly different to the current system, despite not being trustless &amp; therefore sharing some flaws.
Change for the better is worthwhile, even if it's not change for the perfect.
@_date: 2014-10-16 12:54:59
Absolutely - more places to spend Bitcoin makes it worth having, but consumer adoption would speed up if merchants offered a small incentive (e.g. 1% discount), as they're saving 1-3% + no chargeback fraud from Bitcoin purchases.  
It would be great if Bitpay promoted this &amp; encouraged merchants to do it.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:22:01
There's also increasing supply (something around 18% increase this year) to factor in.
With static or slowly increasing demand, the price could still be dropping given this supply increase.
Not saying there's not a drop in demand, but there may not be if holders keep holding &amp; new buyers materialise more slowly than new bitcoins from miners who need to sell to fund their operations.

For user issued assets, counprism is the only realistic option at the moment for one very important reason: In about 5 minutes I can get someone with little/no knowledge of crypto-currency, ask them to download the counprism app, and explain how to receive &amp; send these tokens.
The only pain is the need for Bitcoin fees for transactions. 
Could it be an option for the asset creator to pay Bitcoin transaction fees relating to their asset?  They could restrict number of transactions per user, accunt for this cost when issuing assets, and monitor their trabsaction fund to make sure their asset keeps working with users needing bitcoins.
This would make the whole process very easy for new users, and they wouldn't be confused by needing bitcoins to transact etc.
In addition to this, one other cool feature would be an easy way for issuers to create branded versions of the coinprism app (possibility restricted to specific assets).
@_date: 2014-07-10 08:31:31
Good point. 
Bitcoin has a very static supply (more static than Gold). Bitcoin faces &amp; will always face changes in demand due to changing demand for use, and speculation. 
Fixed supply &amp; variable demand = unstable price.
Stability is impossible with a fixed supply, and some people want stability in a currency. 
I don't get how this isn't obvious to people like this author.  Volatility may decrease from where it is now, but the price of Bitcoin will never stabilise. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:25:35
What negative attributes of a centralised system does NuBits have?  
Bear in mind the concept can be used for pegging to anything (e.g. a basket of goods if you don't like inflation). 
It can't be controlled and abused by a single entity (e.g. Government).
If having an adjustable supply is what you see as a 'flaw', then you misunderstand the whole point of NuBits (stability, which isn't possible with a fixed supply).
Only issue I can see is that it's currently closed source, but they plan to open the source at some point, which will solve that.

This is an interesting article relating to why inflation is bad if we assume our existing monetary setup, but the arguments don't stand if you have an economy built around a currency where deflation is expected &amp; built in.
In such an economy, a decrease in deflation &amp; move towards inflation would become the worrying economic indicator, as inflation would only happen in a contracting economy.
Loans could be made with deflation adjusted 'real' interest rates, and deflation adjusted 'real' wages would be expected &amp; the norm, as long as purchasing power wasn't decreasing people would be fine.
I also question the logic that people spend less if prices are falling. If your purchasing power goes up, I'm pretty sure you're more likely to spend, but as deflation generally only happens in times of economic hardship, I wonder if economists are confusing cause &amp; effect in this case?

Preventing price rises in a flexible supply crypto-currency is very easy - simply increase supply. 
Stopping the supply increasing in the event of falling demand is easy - simply stop creating new currency units. 
Reducing supply is not as easy, but I don't see it as an insurmountable problem. 
Do you really believe that nobody will ever figure out a way of creating &amp; maintaining a fairly stable crypto-currency and that completely inflexible supply is the only option?

Deflation within the current monetary system is bad because it generally means that banks aren't lending as much, companies aren't investing as much, and consumers aren't spending as much.
Because of this, people just think that deflation always = bad, as they don't have any experience except from within the existing monetary system.
A bitcoin economy would not work at all like this, as during times of increased economic growth, deflation would increase, and inflation would become an indicator of a badly performing economy instead of deflation.

They don't owe a dollar balance; they owe a bitcoin balance because they lost Bitcoin, not dollars.
If they lost thousands of BTC, putting them in a position where they have liabiliies of Bitcoin (Bitstamp users balances) beyond the amount of Bitcoin they hold, then they are insolvent in Bitcoin and need to buy Bitcoin to remain solvent, hence the need to buy a specific quantity.  If the price is lower, it costs less for them to buy that quantity of BTC, which is good for them. 
If they have enough Bitcoins to already be solvent then they won't need to buy.

I don't think there are any examples of a worldwide monetary system collapse, so while I'm not saying it's impossible, I'd be surprised it happened.  People need an alternative system to move into to allow the current system to totally collapse, so maybe there'll be a gentle errosion leading to big change over many years, rather than a big 'suddenly all fiat is worthless' moment.  Though I'll probably be wrong (as will most people making predictions about future changes to the monetary system!)

Reduced supply = upward price pressure.
Where the price actually goes also depends on demand levels and sources of supply other than new coins being sold.
If you assume other sources of supply to be equal, and demand to be equal, the halvening will increase the price.

BU is another version of client software for Bitcoin (core is another) - it's not a separate coin.

Core couldn't avoid hitting the 1mb block constraint despite it being an obvious hurdle with years to plan.
They completely unnecessarily let the 1mb cap constrain a fledgling technology, and who knows what damage that has caused to the growth of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin will only survive if it can adapt quickly, and core failed to adapt to avoid an obvious and predictable hurdle, so I really hope they are not going to be the only option for Bitcoin client software going forward.

Even with GPU mining farms, home users can join in on the same technology as commercial miners at a reasonable price, while the latest ASICs aren't available to punters at a similar price to miners, so it's likely to be significantly more decentralised than the current situation.

If LN, Side chains etc had been ready 12 months ago, I'd agree.  
But they weren't.   In that case, the responsible thing to do would be making sure the network isn't hindered until the solutions are ready, especially when there would have been consensus to raise the limit to 2mb had core proposed it.
Oh well, at least in 6 months this will all be history &amp; we can all just look back and learn :D

I don't know about 21, but the anti-spam possibilities of digital currency are significant.  
As well as emails, spam phone calls are very annoying (more of an issue for me than email), so you could automatically reject any calls from unknown numbers unless they attach a payment, which you can refund at your discretion (i.e. if they're not spamming you).
This would be made easier if everyone had a small wallet with Bitcoin in, and if 21 help with that, then great!

I got the idea of an over 300% loan to deposit ratio for Northern Rock from here:
If you google 'Northern Rock deposit to loan ratio' it comes up with this figure.  It's publicly available data, not my opinion.
I think the link I provided agrees with you on the mechanism of Northern Rock's borrowing &amp; risks, but disagrees that a bank can't loan out more than what it has in deposits. 
This paper by the bank of England also clarifies the misconception that banks lend only from deposits:  
This is why i think a limit of 100% loan to deposit ratio could be helpful in preventing excessive lending, which exasserbates the risks you clearly outlined.

Would you consider Bitcoin core an altcoin if a majority of users decided to fork Bitcoin to a prefered incompatible implementation?
It's a strange question, as we're talking about forks from the same chain, rather than true altcoins that have their own genesis block.
Can you think of a better term than 'altcoin' to describe a Bitcoin implementation that has options in it that you don't like, but will only activite in the case of a majority running that implementation?
Surely its the majority is who decides what is Bitcoin and what is a failed fork, and given that, XT, Classic etc can never be alts if they activate, and if the don't activate, they're compatible with core and other implementations.
What percentage of agreement constitutes 'consensus' in your opinion?
I hope you come around on this one, as you're dividing the Bitcoin community, and it's sad to see.

@_date: 2017-03-19 09:00:08
I think both core and BU consider users, but have different visions on how to scale things, and different visions of who the user is (BU wants more users to use Bitcoin directly, Core wants most users to interact with Bitcoin through third parties who set up payment channels etc).
The biggest threat to Bitcoin's usability is the severe restriction on transaction throughput and high fees, which Core hasn't managed to fix during their perod of dominance of Bitcoin client software development.
Whoever 'wins' in this idiotic war, I hope that future dev teams stay more user focused than Core has so far been.

One part of the article says that 100% reserves will be required, and another says banks will “only be able to lend money that they have from savers or other banks”, which surely means fractional reserve? 
How can you lend depositors funds with a 100% reserve requirement?
Is a reserve ratio limit practically the same as limiting the loan-deposit ratio?
Fractional reserve is kind of money creation, but at the moment, banks can create depisits when issuing loans irrespective of their deposits, so they aren't lending out savers' deposits, they're simply creating new money (hence the ridiculous loan-deposit ratios leading up to 2008).
It seems sensible to challenge the banks' privilege of being pretty much the sole creators of money given their huge failures, but there must be good proposals in place to make sure businesses and individuals have access to sufficient borrowing to prevent economic meltdown.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:52:33
Agreed. Upward price pressure from one factor doesn't necessarily lead to an increase in price.

Bitcoin may succeed or fail, but the potential upside is huge.  It's high risk, and potentially high reward. 
I would also say that crypto-currency / distributed ledger tech is broader than just Bitcoin, and the whole scene has incredible potential.   Picking winners in this space is impossible - nobody knows who will be the biggest player in 10 years time, but I think it's wise to cobsider having a broader 'crypto portfolio' than only Bitcoin. (if Bitcoin fails to progress, it may get overtaken by more scalable alternatives in the future...  or it may always dominate the crypto-currency scene). 
However, there are many scams around, so be careful to look for technologies that bring real potential value.
Think long term, don't try to day trade -  your as likely to lose as win, and it's far more relaxing to not bother!
The old "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and don't put all of you eggs in one basket" is also worth saying.

Definitely - 95% isn't going to happen in the foreseeable future. 
Unless BU / other implementations decide on an altered segwit that is applied by hard fork, I can't see it happening.
If everyone had agreed to a 2 or 4mb blocksize limit increase 2 years ago, perhaps many would have come together to make segwit work &amp; BU wouldn't need to exist.
Oh well, what has happened has happened, and I hope the tribes come back together once this ridiculous blocksize debate is settled one way or another.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:38:59
Why would it be a mess? BU would only activate if over 75% of the network supported it for quite a long period if I remember correctly, and then there would be a delay until the actual fork. It would also take a long time to get to 75% support if it ever happened, so I think everyone would have sufficient warning.

I don't know how representative that is coming from a biased source, but it's clear from that survey that the majority support a hard fork upgrade to Bitcoin with blocksize increase plus more when a consensus for such exists. 
With Core actively working against consensus on any hard fork upgrade, Segwit2x is the most widely supported action for those who prefer it to doing nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:47:19
It seems to be part of a desperate attempt to cling to 'power'. 
It doesn't matter if a huge majority of the Bitcoin community wants Bitcoin2x - if some people don't want it, they'll fight it at the expense of Bitcoin as a whole.

@_date: 2017-08-21 07:30:21
I'm talking about scaling the transaction capacity of Bitcoin, which has been maxed out at many times in the last year.
Other improvements to node software are of course welcome, but starting nodes more quickly does nothing to improve the transaction capacity of Bitcoin.
Failure to increase the transaction capacity of Bitcoin has been Bitcoin's biggest failure so far, and is probably a good part of the reason Bitcoin has lost significant market share to competitors. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:39:36
Not a single Bitcoin developer from a select list I'm sure. The Segwit2x software didn't write its self, and I'm sure the miners who back it could afford to pay a few developers.
If you enable 'weighting' on the second link, it indicates over 40% support from Bitcoin companies, so if that's accurate, 40%+ of companies plus around 90% of miners is pretty significant.
Either way, there needs to be a split between those who want to take action on scaling, and those who want to stall indefinitely / for far too long. 
Though I guess those who want to scale in a timely manner could just switch to Bitcoin Cash.   
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:55:38
Which was a big mistake that has resulted in Bitcoin being crippled unnecessarily even when it did reach capacity.
Perhaps it was a test of Bitcoin governance as someone says in that thread later, and Bitcoin Cash's emergence is purely down to this issue not being addressed in time.
Will be very interesting to see how this all plays out, but I hope it's not the stumbling block that ends up killing Bitcoin vs alternatives.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:37:24
What XT agreement? Or Classic agreement? 
Those were competing Bitcoin implications that never reached anywhere near the required threshold to activate their proposals, but they weren't agreements in the same vein as the Hong Kong and New York agreements.
This time is very different because 90% of hash power plus many highly influential Bitcoin infrastructure companies have agreed to go along with it (Segwit2x) on a specific date.  
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:00:23
Do you have any evidence for this, or is it just obviously true to those with strong minds?
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:52:26
I don't remember those letters, but if that's the case, one huge difference is that you can look at the blockchain and see over 90% support from miners for Segwit2x, where XT / Classic / EC only ever reached around 40% at their peak. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:00:45
But it wasn't done in a timely way that prevented shutting down many use cases of Bitcoin due to hiked transaction costs. 
However, I guess that's kind of water under the bridge &amp; once lightning network is running those use cases can return, which should be great for Bitcoin.
However it plays out, I hope in future the Bitcoin community can take action more proactively.   
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:41:22


I don't believe that's the case - I can't see that 8mb or lower blocks would cause any harm to the network at this time, or reduce decentralisation in any meaningful way, at least not compared to miner centralisation.
I agree though that base layer Bitcoin in its current form cannot provide credit card / PayPal level scaling, and second layer solutions seem likely be the answer. However, I don't agree with the failure to take simple steps (e.g. small blocksize increase) to stay ahead of demand while second layer solutions can be developed. 
This failure has caused unnecessarily high fees and congestion that has pushed users to other cryptocurrencies, and indirectly caused a number of hard forks in the name of trying to avoid one.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:51:36
Outsourcing their costs to miners who, 90% of which want to take on those costs. 
I'm sure any profitable Bitcoin company can afford to run a few nodes without noticing the cost, even if they could have up to 8mb to download and store every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:04:25
I think because the participants intend to follow through on the agreement, rather than the Hong Kong agreement that seemed more like a stalling tactic by its organisers rather than an agreement in good faith with the other participants.

@_date: 2017-08-21 15:57:52


I think light wallets, such as acinq's android app enable lightning channels with a light client, though I could be wrong. If light clients are available, it shouldn't be an issue, but if a full node is required, you're right that high bandwidth costs in developing countries could be an issue for larger blocks (at least in the short term, as telecoms markets are booming in developing countries).
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:19:30
They have not managed to increase transaction capacity ahead of demand, and that is a huge failure in my view.
If others are ok with a slow, expensive, constrained Bitcoin (which many obviously are), that's fine, but don't be surprised when those that want to stay ahead of the curve take action towards that end. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:45:56
I diversified my portfolio away from Bitcoin, investied in teams who are more proactive, and have done pretty well from it. But I would have preferred that Bitcoin had innovated in a timely manner.
I don't have the time or resources to do anything particularly significant about it, and that doesn't make my opinion worthless as you seem to be insinuating.
Being part of a community and providing constructive criticism IS contributing and is highly important. 
Slow and steady in this game eventually wins the race to obsolescence. 
I hope Segwit +Lightning are enough to prevent this for Bitcoin, but failure to stay ahead of the market is not a good sign.

Surely it's about as ironic as someone building a massive swimming pool and it being empty before it's filled up with water?
I'd expect it to take quite a while before transaction volumes are significant, as I don't think many wallets or companies will accept BCH immediately. Though due to low fees, it may become useful in moving funds between exchanges quite quickly.

Bitcoin's price proves that it has value.  If a Bitcoin had no value, nobody would pay hundreds of dollars for one.
Like other currencies, its value comes from the confidence people have that it will hold a similar or greater value in the future (short or long term) and be accepted in exchange for other valued products or services.  
Unlike fiat currencies, its value also comes from utility that it currently holds (the value of making immutable blockchain transactions on a highly secure chain).

It would enable banks to use blockchain technology without using Bitcoin, so in that sense, it does separate blockchain technology from Bitcoin for their usage.
However, centralised blockchains don't make any sense to me. What can they do that a database can't achieve?  Consensus on a bank's own servers is easy without blockchains.
@_date: 2015-08-29 06:58:17
I don't think so, because if they use it, they have to contribute with transaction fees, and their use will create demand for Bitcoin, therefore putting upward pressure on prices, which then benefits any holders (including miners). 
@_date: 2015-08-29 11:46:01
It'll be interesting to see how this plays out as block rewards keep reducing over time.  Miners will end up almost solely dependent on transaction fees. Hopefully usage and capacity grows enough for transactions to be affordable, and provide sufficient resources to miners.  It'll all find an equillibrium somewhere.
@_date: 2015-08-02 20:37:29
I've just received an invite, and it is very slick!  I love the way users wont need to worry about bitcoin balances to handle assets.
I'm interested in issuing assets that are kind of like bonds, so need to be able to make interest payments to asset holders (via bitcoin), and re-buy/call bonds so they can be re-purchased by the issuer under certain conditions.

Absolutely.  I want Bitcoin to succeed, but if its community can't agree on how to improve something as fundamental as its crippling limit on transactions per second after 6 years of operation, I wonder if it'll manage to keep up with some newcomers.

The core devs are working actively to make sure there is no consensus for a hard fork to increase blocksize, while giving insufficient consensus as the main reason for no hard fork.
It's clear that they don't want to reach any consensus on hard fork blocksize increase any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:24:57
High fees, slow confirmation times, due to capacity limitations being reached. 
If transaction volumes can't grow, transaction prices go up and fewer people can use the network. 
This means certain use cases become unviable, which some people think is just fine, but others see it as the beginning of an exodus of users from Bitcoin towards competitors that'll make Bitcoin uncompetitive over time.   
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:00:32
It made sense to most people 6 months ago, hence people losing trust in core's leadership.
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:36:24
I'm pretty sure Core would have been capable of providing a hard fork blocksize increase a couple of years aho if it suited them.
I just hope a scaling solution gains enough traction to get adopted soon to stop Bitcoin continuing to lose ground to competitors.
Extension blocks also fix maleability, though right now 1mb blocksize is the active constraint on the network, not maleability.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:08:04
Yes, but it's not likely that transaction volumes would grow so fast that 8mb blocks would be filled within a very short time frame. 
Nor is it likely that miners would accept blocks larger than a size they're comfortable with, which could constrain the rate of blocksize growth toward any new limit.

If you don't build it in &amp; competitors do, you stand to lose a lot. Your customers won't be happy if their hardware suddenly has a disadvantage against competing hardware, so if the tech is built in, it can be enabled if required.
They'd be stupid not to build it in assuming it doesn't have a huge cost overhead. Whether they have lied about not using it is one question, and the flip side of that is whether Greg Maxwell has been lying or not.
@_date: 2017-04-22 18:21:32
That would be 8mb Max blocksize - not 8mb blocks right away.
Before the 1mb cap was constraining the network, it was increasingly slowly over time, so assuming it continued to do that, it may take a good few years to gradually reach 8mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-14 15:05:59
Miners haven't yet provided leadership when it comes to scaling solutions.
It's the providers of solutions that need to get a degree of consensus in order for their plans to be implemented. Miner consensus is a necessary part of that, but so is consensus between users (if miners decided they'd like to shrink the network capacity to create higher fees, users would vote with their feet, to the detriment of Bitcoin). 
I'd be happy if miners took the initiative to enhance the network by agreeing between them how Bitcoin should scale, but that doesn't appear to be happening yet.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:53:36
If the core devs are the best of the best, how could they not avoid maxing out the Bitcoin network transaction capacity on a 1mb blocksize limit that was easily avoidable? 
If Bitcoin can't move forward in capacity, it won't succeed long term, and Core have failed in their leadership to find a way past a pathetic 3 or so transactions per second. Any way forward that safely avoided this limit would be better than Core's way.
I don't know if BU are any better as a dev team, but I know that Bitcoin will not remain the dominant crypto currency for ever if it doesn't improve and adapt, and Core have presided over this failure.
My hope is that core / BU / Classic / Extension Blocks / other devs find a solution that works for the majority of the ecosystem and move forward quickly, but humility &amp; flexibility is in short supply.
Core could be the best devs in the world, but if they can't get consensus to move the network past a critical hurdle, they've failed to lead Bitcoin as well as they could have.
@_date: 2017-04-15 07:51:56
I'm talking about the future - there is no big exodus from Bitcoin at the moment, but there are examples that could become trends, e. g:
Open bazaar is looking to move to an alternative blockchain due to slowness &amp; transaction cost. 
Storj is looking to move its tokens to an alternative blockchain to reduce fees, increase transactions speed, and add new features. 
These are two early examples, and there are probably more.
To imagine Bitcoin can remain relatively expensive &amp; slow and not lose users to faster / cheaper solutions with added features is dillusional.

A proposal can start as contentious and end up with a higher degree of consensus / less contention if people actively seek and build towards increasing consensus.
I guess the powers in the Bitcoin world are just terrible diplomats.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:56:16
Instead, why not build on the consensus around 2x so that it's not a controversial hard fork, and support testing &amp; building the code so it's less of a risk?
Even if a majority of miners and powerful Bitcoin companies were doing something you don't like; what is more damaging, a 2mb blocksize, or a controversial hard fork?
I believe the answer is the controversial hard fork, and its those acting against the consensus that exists among a majority of miners that will make any hard fork controversial.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:52:20
Hard forks are needed for significant change to the network, e.g. removing an outdated blocksize limit that's been (and still is) holding Bitcoin's network capacity back.
Promotion of using SegWit is a good idea too, as that'll ease capacity, though it's not as immediate an impact as a sensible blocksize increase.
Sticking to the status quo seems like a bad idea when the only change is a sensible blocksize increase and opposing the fork could be so damaging.
In my view, those making the planned, sensible, and needed hard fork contentious are not those who proposed it, but those who oppose it.

Or is it time to accept Segwit2x and work together to scale Bitcoin to compete against Fiat?
If a strong consensus is formed, there will be no increased risk of negative influences acting against Bitcoin.
As soon as it's clear which side is winning after the fork, I hope the 'losing' side conceeds defeat and joins together with the 'victorious' side to make Bitcoin as strong as possible. 
Even better if this can happen ahead of the fork.
However, there seems to be too much arrogance for that to be a likely outcome :D 
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:39:22
SegWit was a massive change - 2x is very simple in comparison.
To be fair, many have voiced the desire for not having a crippled Bitcoin network for a long time &amp; been sidelined or ignored. 3 monts is plenty of time for anyone who wants to prepare to do so.

True. But if they were less stubborn, couldn't they contribute as well?
I guess nobody likes having their power taken away or diluted.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:37:27
I guess because I see small blockers' opposition to the fork as counter productive to Bitcoin as a whole, by making the hard fork more contentious than it needs to be due to their rejection of what I see as a sensible blocksize increase.
To me, it's their stubbornness that is causing their opposition to the fork rather than a pragmatic assessment of the risks of a more contentious hard fork vs the risks of a 2mb blocksize.
If they were being pragmatic, I think they'd accept the 2mb blocksize (partially due to overwhelming miner support of over 90%), and work to make the hard fork as uncontentious as possible by offering compatible software &amp; promoting adoption even if it's not their ideal direction.
But from my limited perspective, ego, areogance, and ideology seems to be winning over pragmatism.
I could of course be wrong, but that's some of the reason I'm addressing those opposing the fork rather than Segwit2x proponents, who seem to have a consistent position that's in its self a compromise of accepting SegWit and a small blocksize increase in recognition of the need for on &amp; off chain scaling sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:11:56
Surely it'll be just as free as it is now, as any future groups will be free to hard fork it in whatever direction they like?
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:34:30
Good question, and I'd be interested to hear opinions of Segwit2x supporters as to why they wouldn't consider doing that. 
A lot of people agreed to &amp; signed up for Segwit2x before Bitcoin Cash was a thing. It seems many of those people didn't agree with Bitcoin cash's approach, or they would have joined in.
I'd be quite happy if all Segwit2x supporters agreed to shift support &amp; hashpower to Bitcoin cash, but that doesn't seem to be a view any of them are putting forward.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:21:53
There we go - a great example of making reasons to not build a consensus around what is undeniably the most popular direction for miners + a number of very important companies.
If you can't think of why some people might think full blocks, big mempools, unpredictable fees &amp; performance, and cpnstrained transaction capacity is a bad idea that an increased blocksize can improve, then I doubt you're trying to find scientific merit in the concept.
There's plenty of time if people pull in the same direction, but obviously people like yourself and many others fear a 2mb blocksize over a contentious hard fork that you're contributing to by not building consensus to avoid the hard fork being contentious.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:22:41
The core devs have collectively failed to keep Bitcoin's capacity ahead of demand. 
That's a massive failure for a new technology in my view, and given their lack of urgency to fix the  situation means I don't give their opposition to Segwit2x much weight.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:09:46
I wish both 'sides' were less arrogant and more open to compromise for the benefit of the ecosystem.
Though maybe the differences are irreconcilable and a split is needed. If one group genuinely think low capacity, high fees is better than high capacity low fees, and the other group thinks the opposite, a beneficial compromise is unlikely.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:04:23
Some people wanted bigger blocks but didn't agree with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, and had already agreed to a plan ahead of Bitcoin cash happening. So they're just sticking to their plan.
Bitcoin cash is also only around 10% of the market cap of Bitcoin. For those who want to see the main Bitcoin chain scale using both on and off chain scaling, Segwit2x is a good option.
Many are not happy with Core's failure to keep Bitcoin's transaction capacity growing ahead of demand.
The best idea is to accept that 2x is happening &amp; build towards making it  successful even if it's not your preferred route forward. The alternative could be quite messy.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:34:22
Good point. I guess I just can't understand the apparent fear of a contentious hard fork being catastrophic combined with an apparent desire to make it as contentious as possible by actively working against consensus building.
You're right though - it's great that this is possible, and if it weren't possible, freedom would suffer. 
It will indeed be interesting to see how it plays out, though the way it's going there may be some big losers, which wouldn't need to be the case if there were a bit more humility &amp; pragmatism and less ego &amp; arrogance (on both sides that is).
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:19:57
So why wasn't a hard fork planned 24 months ago well ahead of network congestion that was utterly predictable?
I guess in the end this split is inevitable and between those who think that increasing network capacity ahead of demand is important, verses those who don't.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:56:15
I'd take my chance with a team who value scaling above stalling.
Core have made it very clear that they don't see a need for high capacity of transactions &amp; low cost usage for Bitcoin. Their vision is just not the Bitcoin I want to see, so I'd certainly side with another group of developers who are not proven to have failed to keep Bitcoin ahead of the curve.
Practically, I'm not backing either - I'm largely invested in more forward looking crypto assets until Bitcoin has a vision &amp; direction I like, without huge risks (like the unpredictable upcoming hard fork). While I'm not significantly invested, I still hope for the best for Bitcoin.
Edit: Although I come down on the other side, I like your reasoning in your post. My reasoning for coming down on the other side is that I would prefer to see core being 'fired' than continuing to constrain Bitcoin unnecessarily, and in my view to its detriment. If Bitcoin is to succeed long term, it needs to evolve and adapt, and under core's leadership it's failed to do that, so perhaps there needs to be new leading developers in Bitcoin.
It'll be very interesting to see how it all plays out!
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:26:36
There are 3 groups I think, not just 2.
There are Bitcoin Cash supporters, Bitcoin + Segwit2x supporters, and Bitcoin Segwit with no 2x supporters.
If all big blockers were in one camp, it may make sense to all join in with Bitcoin Cash. But it's potentially a big risk due to the chance of never being recognised as just 'Bitcoin'. Also, many big blockers are commited to layer 1 and 2 solutions, and it's not a guarantee that Bitcoin Cash is going in that direction (some seem to see on-chain as the only legitimate way to scale, though I guess they're a minority).
If Segwit2x suceeds with 90%+ of hash rate &amp; significant industry support, I expect it'll be seen as Bitcoin, with 'Bitcoin Segwit1x' or whatever becoming another minority fork like Bitcoin cash currently is.
So the direction of 'Bitcoin' is something that still needs to be worked out even with Bitcoin Cash having split off, as there are still many big blockers involved with Bitcoin who don't like Bitcoin cash for whatever reason. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:43:14
I see keeping Bitcoin Crippled as a far bigger risk than the risk of larger blocks being potentially damaging.
We'll see who agrees in November, but it's interesting how many are building to maximise the potential damage of the hard fork by working against it rather than working to mitigate the risks they see. I know they don't want the fork, but it's happening, so people should deal with it maturely and responsibly.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:02:46
If core simply added code to be compatible with Segwit2x, the network would continue with no significant split. What harm would it do? 
They'd still have significant influence with the number of people using Core, but what's to be gained by being so stubborn they can't include a small change that is someone else's idea?
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:29:52
There is a significant consensus for change among miners, and a smaller but still very significant group working against that consensus because they don't like it.
I guess a split needs to happen due to the fundamental differences between those who want Bitcoin to perform well, and those who want to keep the network crippled &amp; hold control at all costs (e.g by choosing to make a hard fork that wasn't their idea as contentious as possible rather than minimising its potentially negative impacts).

Scotland doesn't need independence to issue a digital complimentary currency, which is what Scot Pound is being proposed as.   Current Scottish government powers should be sufficient.
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:28:22
I agree that separation of money &amp; state may be the best solution, but in the context of state based crypto-currency, I prefer the proposal of Scot Pound (creating new money by giving it to people) than creating demand by threatening to destroy wealth if it's not spent.
Direct QE like this can't be a magical cause of sustainable growth, but as a temporary boost, I guess it would act to transfer wealth from everything denominated in the currency, to the recipients of newly issued currency, which is more likely to be spent in the short term.  This would genuinely stimulate the economy, and while inflation is low, few would complain - the biggest potential losers (biggest holders of assets in the currency) would also be those most likely to gain indirectly from the stimulation (share price rises from imoroved business activity).
But as you say, it's effectively creating a bubble, so if done too much, the negative effects of inflation &amp; asset bubbles would outweigh the temporary benefits of a short boost in economic activity.
Whether the benefits outweigh the costs if done sparingly is an important question to explore before trying something like this out.

I like your concept, though I don't think it's 'exceptional' whiskies that cost $300+ per bottle; that's only exceptional and rare whiskies. 
If a whisky is exceptional &amp; common, in the UK at least, $70 to $120 would be an ok price range, and those same whiskies will become over $300+ a few years after they've stopped being sold, as rarety increases.
I'd personally be occasionally interested in fine whiskies in the $70-100 range if the price is competitive.
Much above that &amp; I feel that people are paying for rarety, not just quality, and I'd prefer to stick to the better value quality stuff.
However, many people do spend a lot for rarety, so best of luck if you cater to them :)

"Because you automatically have several cents/dollars worth of coin." - at a cost of several hundred dollars &amp; the bother of running the thing?  Surely that's friction?
If that's beneficial, why not sell bonds for fiat that pay out in Bitcoin, without the diminishing returns of quickly obsolete mining hardware, or the overheads of producing that hardware?
This could be sold as a simple wallet that just keeps receiving tiny amounts of Bitcoin, perhaps that represents 4% per year yield or so. 
I'm not sure there's a market for such a product...  but if there is, it could easily be done (regulation being the biggest hurdle).
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:54:30
It could be much simpler for the user than what 21 are offering: they simply pay the money &amp; download the wallet software &amp; don't need to know about the bonds etc - that's behind the scenes.  No hardware, no set up, no support calls when the machine fails, no electricity bill.  Just a transaction &amp; a download.
It would probably be easier for the company as well; setting up an investment fund that pays out a revenue stream to customers in Bitcoin would have its challenges, but would be a whole lot easier than developing custom bitcoin mining chips plus other software &amp; hardware. 
I'm interested to hear more about what 21 will be doing in regards to providing a marketplace for digital goods.  Perhaps that will somehow explain the logic of the mining chip.

"He said it would help the bank to manage inflation by enabling it to bypass the current constraint against lowering rates below zero."
Trying to fix the economy by threatening the destruction of people's wealth to encourage them to spend is ridiculous. 
I'd prefer something along the lines of the New Economics Foundation's 'Scot Pound' proposal that gives everyone £250 in digital pounds - it creates new spending and people see it as a bonus, not a penalty.  
As long as inflation is low, a direct QE to all residents feels a lot nicer than saying 'spend your money or we'll burn it'.
The effectiveness of this proposal also assumes people couldn't exchange a Bank of England issued digital currency for Bitcoin or another store of value that is immune to its value being stripped to encourage spending.  That seems like a silly assumption.
@_date: 2015-09-27 10:15:18

Or it might have all the same benefits, and in addition, no delays for confirmation, handle many hundreds of times more transactions per second, be completely anonymous, and require far less power to run the network.

Again, I appreciate &amp; respect your reasoning.
It's not the 2x blocksize increase its self that I value - it's the willingness to take action when it's needed that I value over the current team.
If they're willing to do a 2mb hard fork, they may be willing to impliment further capacity increases in a timely way (specifically ahead of capacity reaching its limits on a regular basis). 
I have no faith that core will have any urgency in keeping Bitcoin's capacity ahead of demand as they have a track record of not keeping up. I don't think that's cautious - I think it's reckless and the main reason Bitcoin is now only 50% of crypto asset market cap instead of a much larger figure. 
If Bitcoin doesn't keep up, the competition will eventually overtake it, and I think it's more likely to keep up with leadership that takes short and long term scaling seriously.

Small blocks would not only delay transactions if transaction volumes were growing - they'd cap the volume of transactions causing a rise in fees as rationing decides who's transactions get included.
With double the current number of transactions, bigger 2mb+ blocks would include all transactions with 10 minutes, whilst with a 1mb limit the situation would be far worse (rising mempool, rising fees, leaving users, until 50% of transactions just stopped being made at all).
@_date: 2016-10-13 07:15:19
I'm not sure exactly how it would work, except for not well, and I think it'd soon become more than a simple delay in confirmation time (e.g a 'delay' of 3 days would be more than an inconvenience, it'd be a failure).  
If the mempool increased by 1mb per block with only 50% of transactions being processed each time, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be long before it would be a matter of transactions effectively being dropped rather than delayed.
Of course demand would drop, but the point I'm making is that there's a big difference between 2mb blocks &amp; 1mb blocks if there were demand for 2x today's transaction volume, even if confirmation time wasn't a big deal for people (though obviously it is important to most users - seconds would be better than minutes).
@_date: 2015-11-17 08:43:56
The mining chip doesn't make any sense to me.   
It makes no financial sense, and I doubt there is anyone looking to develop bitcoin based services that would find it difficult to send a few bits to a wallet on a Raspberry Pi.
Is it just a way to keep their services exclusive - no chip, no access?
I'm glad the general feeling on here has become more positive than when this was announced to overwhelming criticism, but I still have no idea how it'll help people build new services that they couldn't do without it. 
If it can somehow save devs a couple of days of work &amp; some hassle, I guess it'll pay for its self.

I'd like to know how they calculated the derivative market size. 
E.g. Would an option be counted as the price of the option contract, or the amount the option entitles the buyer to action? 
Is it the price of a swap contract, or the quantity of assets on both sides being swapped that are counted?
If it's the latter, this could be greatly overstating the size of derivatives compared to other things on the chart.
Some derivatives seem like useful and quite boring contracts that pose no threat whatsoever.  Others can be dodgy (credit default swaps etc).  It'd be good to differentiate between these when trying to state how much of a threat derivatives are.

Transaction capacity has been reached while core had been massively dominant = core failed to prioritise scaling sufficiently. If Bitcoin wants to scale, it needs to move on from Core software dominance.
About 4 years ago when I got interested in Bitcoin I thought it was amazing &amp; limiting how few transactions it could cope with. 
The fact that the Bitcoin community has failed to increase capacity in that 4 years is very worrying, and core must take a chunk of the blame for not providing solutions in time or in a manner that has gained acceptance. 
Core's Segwit was too late, and didn't attract sufficient support from the Bitcoin community (yes Bitmain, but many others as well).
I will be glad to see the rise in influence of actors who deliver results when it comes to scaling, and I hope core can adapt to become major contributors to progress rather than sulking if things don't go exactly how they planned.

If that's Bitcoin, then Bitcoin is ripe for being superceded by more nimble competitors, unless it can begin adapting and improving at a pace.
I agree that it's not all about blocksize and that both on &amp; off chain scaling are needed.
However, I don't see how increasing the blocksize is likely to be anywhere near as big a threat to decentralisation as ASICs &amp; energy intensive mining have already proven to be.

That may well be true, but I wonder how the 'smart money' is such a small portion of experts that it doesn't swing the markets?  You'd think the smartest  would be in control of the most money?
Perhaps it just really is unchartered territory, and the majority just assume it'll carry on as it 'always has'.  The majority certainly didn't see the 2008 crisis ahead of time, so this is plausible.

Very interesting topic, and great work so far.  I'm no academic, but I'm very interested in economic development in general, and the role of digital currencies in this area  is fascinating. 
One concept I'm interested in is the potential for micro finance institutions to become gateways for micro entrepreneurs to access global consumer markets.  Using digital currencies would take care of international transfers, and MFIs could handle fiat on behalf of clients, and manage logistics for export &amp; online retail listings.
Coupling improved global market access with micro loans could enable micro finance to have the impact it has been thought to promise.
Hope you get some good contributions!

Why do you think that believing a 1mb blocksize cap is necessary is the only logical view for someone who understands economics?
Why would a 2mb+ blocksize make no sense to an economist?
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:17:12
I have some understanding of economics and support bigger blocks, or at least the prioritisation of increasing the number of transactions per second handled by Bitcoin, which the 1mb blocksize constraint directly capped.
I can't imagine any economists arguing that the best way to grow a new technology is by restricting its utility and forcing up the cost of using it.
The lack of success in increasing the capacity of the Bitcoin network by the Bitcoin community (not just Core) is a failure that doesn't bode well for Bitcoin's ability to adapt to growth and other future requirements.
Bitcoin is software, and software cannot stand still or it will eventually be superceded. This appears to be in process with Bitcoin at the moment, though I hope actions over the next couple of months open up a route to more innovation and capacity.   
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:03:17
I was thinking of a decentralised crypto currency where the rate of creation of new coins is calculated by the decentralised network based on its own price relative to fiat (how it figures this out may be a challenge, but not a big one I'm sure).
Bitcoin is not simply the dollar without stability, and what I'm suggesting is like Bitcoin, but with a supply that responds to demand with the goal of stability relative to fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:33:40
There could effectively be a 'bank run' on fiat... that would be scary, so I hope it's more orderly than that. 
I'm sure it will be a slow process until crypto tech has sufficient capacity &amp; ease of use to replace fiat currencies.

It may not be hatred, but it does seem like delusion. 
I see huge potential for cryptocurrencies, but if anyone says fiat is useless, but still uses it to buy things, gets paid in it, considers the value of items in it, and sees that many other people do too, then they are deluded.

Yeah, it's the lack of a way to fund exchanges from the UK without paying a premium that is frustrating.  I guess you need a willing friend with an eurozone bank account + currencyfair &amp; you have a solution!
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:37:53
Fair enough, but they have a point about monetary policy.  Keeping prices relatively stable with a fixed money supply would be impossible.
Assuming stable pricing is necessary for a well functioning currency, Bitcoin in its raw form can never fulfill that role.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:54:37
That is true - if the reserve of Bitcoin is used up, then the price would need to drop.  Perhaps a fairly large Bitcoin reserve would be keep the risk of this very low.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:21:39
It does Indeed seem tricky.  I'm assuming the credit itself would be fiat credit, but the user would borrow $x worth of BTC to pay for something? Bitcoin could be used behind the scene instead of visa/mastercard.
Credit denominated in raw Bitcoin would be in little demand if the value of bitcoin is rising (which it would be in this scenario), as paying back 1btc in 3 months time could inflate the cost of anything bought on credit massively.

That's an interesting concept,  though their monetary policy may not be very effective in this situation, as they'd need to affect the global supply of Bitcoin, not just the supply of their own country's currency.  I guess it'd need many governments to collaborate &amp; have unified global monetary policy.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:29:45
The point on the discount price is to increase the supply of the coin, so you're right, except there would be a calculated quantity available, so it couldn't happen to the expense of the currency, but rather the gain.  Yes the person buying at a discount would benefit by doing a job for the currency - helping to increase supply to meet demand, and contribute to a bitcoin reserve to help back the currency when demand drops.  So the currency would, to some degree, be backed by bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:59:53

This would still result in volatile pricing, which would make doing business with only bitcoin as a medium of exchange very difficult.

Once this happens, the low transaction cost benefit of Bitcoin for transactions may be lost, giving it little advantage over debit/credit cards.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:46:10
This is a challenge. Decreasing the supply of new coins would be easy, but decreasing overall supply would be more tricky. As its value can't appreciate, there should be no activity by speculators, so as long as the coins have utility, this shouldn't be a problem.  
If overall demand dropped, their value would indeed need to fall, or some units would need to be taken out of circulation somehow.
Possibly when increasing supply, some could be issued to miners, and others created by the network &amp; issued at a very small discount for BTC, so a BTC reserve could be built up that is later used to buy surplus units in the event of demand dropping.
Can you think of any other way supply could be reduced fairly without 3rd party involvement?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:51:44
I think you'd need to peg to either a single fiat currency, or a basket of currencies, in which case it wouldn't be precisely pegged to any single fiat currency.
I know very little technically about crypto currencies, but in principle  I'd imagine that the productivity of mining would be calculated on a block by block basis so that if there is an upward pressure on price relative to fiat (demand exceeding supply), the supply from the next block would be adjusted to increase supply so that the price remains stable.  If demand was decreasing, the next block would produce fewer coins so that supply of new coins is decreasing.
Knowledge that any hike in price will simply cause an increase in future supply should stop prices jumping in the short term, and speculators wouldn't bother with it.
Has anyone tried to design an altcoin like this?

Yes, it'll never be as stable as a standard currency, but hopefully there will be innovations that enable crypto currencies that are pegged to fiat currencies / a basket of fiat currencies.  These would give the benefits of Bitcoin + the stability of fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:54:19
It certainly is unchartered waters, and there will be a limit to growth, but without a solution to stable pricing throughout that period, the scale of the growth will be severely hampered.
Unless of course people just keep using fiat for pricing, and by the time fiat is usurped by crypto currencies for this purpose, perhaps we'll be through the most turbulent times.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:17:13
The only time I would imagine demand dropping that significantly would be when Bitcoin is rising strongly (people who were using the currency to hedge against bitcoin drops sell to buy BTC). In this situation, the bitcoin reserve would also be growing with respect to the pegged currencies, which should help the reserve go further.  If demand dropped because Bitcoin became highly stable (which should never happen with a rigid supply), then there would no longer be a need for this currency.
What other situations would likely see a significant drop in demand, enough to use up a reserve of, maybe 30% of the currency?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:37:10
I wasn't saying we should try to peg Bitcoin to fiat, but a complementary crypto currency that is pegged to fiat could be very useful for pricing &amp; holding crypto currency without the risk of loss / chance of appreciation.  If you can't see the benefit in stability for pricing, then you won't understand why this is desirable. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 08:28:53
I don't see how or why Kipochi would block 'foreign' Bitcoins being used. 
It's quite exciting; Bitcoin integration with various mobile money services will effectively link together systems with no official compatability (e.g. M-pesa, Zaad &amp; others). 
Anyone with a mobile in Somalia could send/receive payments to/from anyone in the world.
@_date: 2013-10-12 20:25:44
The scenario I was thinking of was paying for goods in person (which I use a credit/debit card or cash for), e.g. at a shop buying items - you don't want to wait around for ages for confirmation.
So those credit / escrow services will be needed for cash replacement, unless bitcoin evolves to operate more quickly somehow?
For wire transfers, this isn't such an issue.

You're right about pricing being in fiat - Bitcoin is terrible for pricing due to volatility, so I don't know how much this debate really matters. 
Bitcoin units need to become invisible in use by the average punter - they wont care how many satoshis/BTC/mBTC something costs. They'll care how many $/£/€/¥ something costs, and pay for it in BTC without realising it because it's an easier/cheaper/better way to pay. 
If this doesn't happen, BTC may never be as big as many (me included) hope.

The only third party you'd need is information providers so that exchange rates can be calculated to adjust new supply volumes.  Is even this too big a risk?
Otherwise, could it not just be a function of the way the coin is programmed to mint new units?

The total value of Bitcoins in circulation is only a few $bn. 
If Bitcoin becomes a globally significant currency, the total value of coins in circulation will grow to being hundreds of billions or several trillions.
That growth is not conducive to stable prices denominated in BTC with a rigid money supply.
A virtual pricing unit, based on a basket of goods, as danielravennest has suggested, seems like a good solution.

I'm suggesting a different type of pegging that isn't based the ability to exchange for fiat, but where new supply of the crypto currency is adjusted on the fly to keep the unit price of the crypto currency 'pegged' to a fiat unit.  Increased demand = increase supply, therefore stabilising price relative to fiat.

That sounds good.
I wonder what these pricing units for goods would be called?
Perhaps we need tracked 'bitdollars'  &amp; 'biteuros' for pricing goods, and they will always be equal to the value of a $ or € on a specific historical date. This would be good for pricing, with no inflation, and would be easy for people to understand.
How would you see this working?
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:00:05
Kind of true, but if it became easy to convert between fiat &amp; btc, it could be used as a payment system whatever the price is doing, as it'd be bought by customer at the time of transaction, sent to merchant as btc, then converted back to fiat by merchant.

@_date: 2013-12-09 23:58:28
Thanks for explaining this - I'm trying to think it all through!
Once the bitcoin price dropped to $900, the only way someone could access the bitcoin reserves of the # is if demand for # is such that there is downward pressure on its price beyond what can be dealt with by halting the creation of new coins. A user couldn't do this whenever they wanted.
Generally, I'd expect demand for # to increase when BTC/$ is falling, and vice versa.
So, if BTC = $1000 &amp; falls to $900, over that period, demand for # may have risen by 100 units. These 100 units are created and exchanged for bitcoin at an average of $950 (0.095 btc if we're assuming 100% backing at issue). 
So there would be  in circulation &amp; 1.095 BTC in reserve when BTC = $900.
Next, the inverse happens on the way back to $1000 per BTC, leaving  in circulation, with 1 BTC in reserve, as we started.
However I would think that expectations of  equalling $1 in the long term should keep stability on the market price when short term demand falls (if someone wants to sell, someone else will be happy to hold due to low risk), so reserves shouldn't be needed every time BTC rises against the $.
With expectations that  will still equal $1 in the future, constrained supply alone may mean that after the fluctuation, the market supports  with BTC = $1000 &amp; a reserve of 1.095 BTC.  Perhaps the reserve won't be needed in this situation, and hopefully never if confidence and expectations are maintained (which may be the most important role of the reserve).
A 100% reserve may inspire confidence initially, but over time a decrease reserve may not be a problem to confidence.
One big question is whether this expectation of stability relative to $/other units can be created and maintained.

Actually, it's similar to Bitcoin in terms of cost &amp; speed- with no fees, faster payments and bitcoin both tend to take a few minutes to an hour to clear/confirm.

Unfortunately at the moment it's likely to be more cost effective to use Western Union or similar, as while Localbitcoins is great, generally the price to buy coins is significantly higher than MtGox rate &amp; the price to sell coins is significantly worse, making the overall cost a lot higher than $5 or so WU charge (unless it's a small transaction).
Saying that, if you just want to use Bitcoin for novelty or other reasons, localbitcoins is good.

That's a good point, but the credit can easily be issued by the service providers, e.g. Coinbase &amp; similar.

If people want credit &amp; will pay enough for it (interest), companies will find ways of providing it.  They have the same incentives and risks as existing credit providers. 
What if someone borrowed $400 from a credit card company &amp; didn't pay back?
However, in this situation all of the same costs associated with running a credit card operation would occur (regulatory compliance), and the costs would be similar. If the merchant doesn't bear these costs, the consumers will have to &amp; may have little incentive to take out Bitcoin credit.
