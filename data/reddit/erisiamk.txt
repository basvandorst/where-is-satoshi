Hi all, I abandoned a transaction a week ago on Bitcoin Core that I set too small a fee for, and it seemed like it worked at the time, but today I can see the unconfirmed transaction has gone back into the memory pool. Anyone know why this might be?
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:54:11
Lol I saw that but it was a weird background to edit in
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:03:42
I'm using the latest version of Bitcoin Core as the sending wallet. If the transaction is dropped from the mempool will I still be charged the fee?

In this case going up to 200 sat/B would cost an extra $30 so I wasn't sure it was worth it. I'll get back to you on that one. :P

Good, I'm not gonna lie, trying to shill altcoins to people via Facebook sounds like a recipe for disaster at the moment. Anyone who would actually buy because they were convinced by a Facebook ad will probably not research crypto properly and end up making more bad decisions and spreading more FUD.

You should set up an algorithm so it plays a song in minor key when bitcoin is dropping and in major key when it's rising. :p

About 12 seconds.

I agree, I'm not planning on selling any time soon and if the market cap does decrease and the mempool starts to diminish again it could go through. The fee was 50 sat/B.

Yeah I think I'm done with waiting for dips :s
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:25
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:57:05
Did the same with 0.05 btc. Was worried when I saw the second dip but then realised why I bought in the first place and kept calm. :)

Price can probably still get 100-1000 times greater as an absolute maximum (not accounting for fiat inflation) if it starts to take over as a primary currency so there's still plenty of time. If it dips, all the more reason to buy. :)

what the actual shit is happening!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:30:22
Honestly I'd be fine if it was just called a single.

P.S.A: You can buy however small an amount of bitcoin you want. Like I just bought £10 worth of bitcoin to test my wallets and bank transfers etc were working. No matter how small you start there is still plenty of room for growth. If bitcoin becomes widely adopted like Facebook etc then you can still expect a 25-250 times return on whatever you put in 5-10 years down the line unless something major happens like mass government action against it.

    &gt; I don't have a ton of bitcoin
    &gt; Has 3 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:59:20
waiting for it to hit -0.0005 :v
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:25:31
I just got in about a week ago and it's mind boggling to me at 3 bitcoins isn't considered a lot :p

£8,333.33 makes me sad. Once the price drops to £5000 I'll buy in some more and get that to £7,500, but yeesh.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:10:37
I actually laughed, good job.

Where are some good places to buy generally useful products with Bitcoin? The only thing preventing me from spending my bitcoin is a lack of ways for me to spend it. I don't spend a lot of my money in general so I shouldn't feel obligated to spend it just for the sake of spending, unless it's on something I want.
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:16:58
I want to support a currency that isn't tied to a government or nation, that I can use for whatever I want without interference.

I'd also like more info, I have a friend who's doing a PhD in BIM.

I just topped up to 0.25 BTC myself. Like having a nice round number so I can look at the price and immediately work out how much money I've lost. :D

Weird coincidence she had $8,000 in her prize pool while answering that.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:33:17
You don't have to sell ALL of it. I'm finally back at my break-even point but I'm going to sell a small portion of it to cover my initial investment when the price gets high enough. That way the remaining bitcoin will all be profit and guilt-free, and I can do whatever I want with it without worrying about "what could have been" etc.
