What misinformation? Bakkt is starting with bitcoin testing on 22 July.
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:02:06
How does it not look good? Mayb your problem is that it never looks good until we reach ATH and then you fomo in. When bitcoin was at 4-6k it also didnt look good to you, and then you probably didnt buy, and now its at almost 12k!! And its still not looking good. Unfortunately when we reach 50k there will always be people like you who waited too long and it still wont look good.

Anyone excited for the Bakkt testnet on 22nd July?
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:47:51
It has been like this for the past 10 years, and it just gets higher everytime. Bitcoin doesnt care if you dont feel great, it will proceed without you.

People arent robots. Not everyone has the same life. Mayb he mined in 2011 but stopped caring because it wasnt valued much and other good/bad things happend in his life where he focussed on.

Does anyone else think black friday is full of crap? I dont live in the USA, but our black friday is just some fake show. There are so many items which are the same price as before, they just increase the ‘original’ price for this day so the new one looks better. And the rest of the products it’s like a couple bucks off.

This happend exact same moment last year when holidays came around. End november to end of december. December 2017 was a different setting, crypto was new to a lot of people and mainstream media made it explode. Now we are used to bitcoin and lots of people are selling because of holidays, and more people are selling because the price declines and they need money so they sell before it gets even lower. I feel like its a combination of holidays and panic selling.

What are you talking about, we almost reached 14k this summer 2019. And even now its staying stable between 6-10k. There are a lot of people buying still.
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:23:18
‘Experts’ said bitcoin would be 50k end of 2018. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:43:14
Ye. It started slow in january. But it slowly climbed up, same for february, march april, steady grow over those months, and then it sprinted towards 13k mid 2019. Now with the halving coming mid 2020, i expect price above 10k definitely.

Bitcoin was nothing in 2011. I can totally understand having bitcoin from 8 years ago. Because back then people didnt understand the potential. Its easy to say that its dumb to forget your wallet now when bitcoin is over 8000$.
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:01:23
Just keep it and you will see that it will rise somewhere in january february.
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:35:18
Next week is black friday, soon after that holidays etc. Iam sure a lot of people are selling because of this. Expect end of january/february for the price to go up again.

So he found out about bitcoin, and a couple hours later he decides to put ALL of his ‘liquid savings’ into bitcoin? Just like that. Hard to believe to be honest. Or mayb its not a big amount of money.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:23:12
How are the transaction fees at these prices? Still good?
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:46:07
Rofl so you lost money and you wanna sell it? How does that even make sense? Really think about it. 
Remember one thing, you havent lost anything until you sell it. So keep it and wait for the price to go up again. Even if it takes months.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:35:53
How are the transaction fees at this price?

It starts with a B and rhymes on fart

Lets say its the year 2080, and most of the people that owned bitcoin died already. And lets say half of them didnt pass their coins to relatives. What happens if most bitcoins are just gone?
@_date: 2019-06-10 08:50:12
It cant be the only currency, thats impossible. But will be worth a lot. And the halvening means less bitcoin entering the market everyday.
I have never read that bitcoin gains 1000% every year. It stayed stable from 2014 to 2016.
@_date: 2019-06-10 09:44:39
You just gave me statistical proof that bitcoin increases a lot over a short period of time. Imagine if you invested in 2016, how rich you would be by now. Keep talking and i will see you again in 2 years.
@_date: 2019-02-07 00:20:53
2050 should be last mined bitcoin. Each time it gets harder to mine bitcoin, there are ‘only’ 4 million to go, but it gets harder and harder, especially with the next halving
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:30:32
Why would you accept your loss? Did you need the money at that moment? Bitcoin will always go up one way or another.
@_date: 2019-06-10 09:08:48
‘Worth a lot’ can be anything. It was worth 1$ 6 years ago, and its now 7.5k. Could anyone ever imagined bitcoin would be above 100$ or even 1000$ back then? 
But to answer your question when there will be a new ‘all time high’, i would say between 2020 and 2021 where it will reach above 20k.
If you own 1 bitcoin, your worth a lot is probably 100k bitcoin. Back in the days ‘worth a lot’ was probably around 10$ bitcoin because you could easily obtain bitcoin.

Dont bother replying anymore. He is too ignorant. He doesnt read and understand anything you type, he just wants a date so he can say ‘i told you so’ and that will give his satisfaction for a moment. But unfortunately that moment will never come. I dont think we hear any of the people talking when bitcoin was 100$ and they said that its dead.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:51:56
Is it? That cant be right
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:32:48
You won’t buy when it drops so hard to 5k.

Ive started to hate the word hodl so much now.

This is not a common thing. They dont delist everything that they dont like. But in this particular case Craig Wright is a fraud and he deserves to be delisted. This guy comes out of nowhere and tells everyone he is the creator of bitcoin and sues people that dont believe him.
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:02:17
Why can't we celebrate both the white paper and the first block mined at their own date.
@_date: 2019-01-23 11:07:38
This ia very interesting to read! Thanks a lot for the explanation.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:18:57
I know its fake when they say: ‘tens of thousands of investors’.  Ive heard that too many times here.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:31:33
Weren’t we at 5k a month ago?
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:15:16
Then you should ve bought in January/February when it was 4k :).
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:40:08
Iam fine with that for now. It’s quite stable. Give it a month or 2 and we might get 8-9k.
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:33:48
These comments are so funny. I love to see people panicking and make things up to feel better.

I was reading a comment on reddit where he/she was so excited that AMD stocks increased by 5%. We got so numb because of crypto...

Profit? Have you seen the views on their channel? Plus they have thousands of patreon donators. These guys have plenty of money, they dont need bitcoin to make money. What they do have is a large audience. If they research a bit more about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and understand what its trying to do. Because their response is the typical answer i get from every person that doesnt understand bitcoin. All the points they made is taken from the negative publicity from the media. So i really hope they start researching bit more.

Is that even legal to not allow you to co-parent? You just kinda bought your kid from your wife now.
