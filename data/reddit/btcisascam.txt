strawman 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:39:36
the truth is against the rules? how am i supposed to know the rules before i make an account? do people who have had an account before r/bitcoin get ban from bitcoin for their name that violates their rules?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:37:51
so ur saying i will never get it because people will keep paying higher and higher and higher fees and bury it. 
real futuristic. 
if i could actually send it i will bet .5 btc that it will never be confirmed. even with confirmtx's help.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:13:56
i did "do the research" and even on this form coinbase was listed as ok. it isn't a hard process. pay for coins. give address. click send. there is no way to mess up. it is all in the hands of the miners. not mine.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:02:37
and you still cannot name one thing?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:01:02
i did not consider it a scam until i bought some. after seeing the evidence of actually using it rather than the fake youtube videos and articles i now see it is a scam. 
another example of this would be "as seen on tv" products
on TV they look and work so great. People review them highly. but you get the item and it is nothing like what you heard.
btc = as seen on tv products.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:20:47
is a 18 dollar fee not high enough? like come on. why it is fucking picking on me?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:11:21
what a fucking total shit scam system. they see i had a big order of btc so they fucking steal it while all the same tranactions get through to trick people into buying more...what a fucking joke..
waiting for the btc exit scam.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:14:14
gdax = coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:30:48
coins STILL unconfirmed 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:43:41
i am willing to bet .5 btc that in 21 days the coins will still not be confirmed. which is funny because if i win i lose because i cant get any coins.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:08:42
get embarrassed for using btc and have nothing to give but an ad hominem 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:20:16
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:46:28
and what dont i know? that this form prefers a different exchange? that seems to be the only thing i "did wrong"
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:07:42
if they get dropped we will consider that no winner but personally i will consider that a win because i can sell them back to coinbase and gtfo
thanks for the input
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:22:51
that is more than the average user should know. I just want to click send and have my payment show up. just like with a cc.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:34:05
i dont understand short it
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:21:00
here is the first one i sent 
ps. there is no way to help i just have to warn people not to get scammed like i did.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:41:41
so ur saying i should of paid more than an 18 dollar fee? holy f do you work for bitcoin?

what rules? reddits rules? it isn't
r/bitcoins rules? now you know they are trying to hide something if they have to make that a rule.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:09:13
yes exactly bro. I also have reason to believe he runs most of the 'dark markets' as well and is responsible for the exit scams of Agora and others.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:21:07
i cannot see the disconnect. Where is it? what exactly am i missing?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:20:18
never heard it before
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:21:30
does not help
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:19:15
is 72 hours not patient? how long is patient? a week? a month? a year?
Year 2037: "the coin will be here soon just be patient"
no one paid me. i am fucking pissed off that my btc is fucking gone. what else can i do? nothing. i cant child pays parent. i cant rbf. and rebroadcasting does nothing
yall say "do your research" i have and thats why i know it is a scam.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:57:25
bitcoin is created.
the creators are the first miners.
hype builds
transactions become "stuck"
original miners steal coin
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:28:09
future is bright when only computer engineers can use it? 
where the fuck is my coin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:02:53
i created this account less than one hour ago to bitch about being scamed or find out what i need to do to get the coins (preferred)
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:35:44
no. i am not here saying altcoin is good.
I just want my coin. you have any idea how stressful it is to lose 7500 USD? thats fucking two months of working gone.
Where is the fucking coin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:46:39
not the one i posted about but i made another on gdax and it arrived in less than 3 hours.
i am about to send another one
what is a website to check what sat/b i should use? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:12:11


"do research"
by the time you do the research whatever you researched is obsolete and you gotta research more. completely useless.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:34:40
ur a fucking btc. it is a failure. 85 hours and coins are not there. what a fucking scam
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:44:58
kk i will try to buy some more with gdax 
i already lost everything whats a little more.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:23:55
holy shit. i do know what im doing. all you do is type in the info. sending address. ammount of bitcoin.
what exactly am i missing because i dont see it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:23:16
strangely? i copy and pasted the address. coinbase calculated my fee and i clicked send. seems fairly standardized. i 100% garentee i will be back here in 7 days complaining my coins have not showed up and you btc shills will say "just be patient" "you did things wrong"
i shouldnt have to be a fucking computer engineer or have 20 3rd party programs and websites to use a currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:07:24
im sending .6 BTC...not 6 fucking dollars.
i paid a 18 dollar fee to send it.
it wont confirm.
i paid 6 DOLLARS to accelerate the transaction.
this shit is a scam. gdax doesnt somehow make the fucking blockchain quicker.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:28:46
i see. but gdax is easy even for non tech folks like me. thanks for letting me know about it
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:13:03
all the money going MIA isn't 'reasonable'
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:57:17
and what dont i know?
it isn't hard.
You buy btc from an exchange. you send that bitcoin to your wallet with your address. first gets verified by Bitcoin nodes. The coin is processed in the mempool by miners and delivered to the address.
that is way fucking more than i should have to know to copy and paste then click send. what exactly am i missing.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:03:31
i have.
 NOTHING works and you cannot tell me the way that works because it fucking doesn't. all you do is enter the address pay 600 sat/b and wait. the system is fucking broken.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:12:54
gdax = coinbase
i tried gdax and got my coins quickly!!
still waiting on the first coins tho. thanks so much for letting me know about gdax
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:44:25
i am here to warn people not to get scammed. 
when bank of america has quicker cheaper service you know you are fucking up.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:40:57
i bet .5 btc that in 7 days the coins will still not be there.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:01:35
cool it said within two blocks. thanks for the help
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:05:39
here is a question
Who fixes these issues? who deals with scaling? is it the miners who buy better computers or join in larger numbers or is there some code that needs to changed? who changes the code?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:32:59
are you joking? it is so simple.
buy the coin &gt; send the coin
thats fucking it. it is not hard at all. no technical skills needed. copy and paste is the hardest part.
what am i missing?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:19:55


i cant do either of these electrum wont let me.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:16:17
im not fucking shilling i just wanna use bitcoin but the money is fucking mia.
here u go.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:12:18
hey i tried gdax and it is great i got my coins so quickly. thanks i never heard of this!
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:04:10
ur right because it was stolen from me..but i dont need it because i will win the bet.
i would say "i will have it when i win the bet" but if you send it i will never get it so just keep it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:35:35
learn how fees and btc network work? you mean pay an INSANE high fee/bribe to get it to work? higher than bank of america? what a fucking joke.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:23:39
i sign up for gdax, worked great btw, and i get email from coin base thanking me for signing up. why would coinbase have a slower paid service and a faster free service? i do not understand
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:02:49
and you cant tell me where.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:10:22
yes exactly bro. I also have reason to believe he runs most of the 'dark markets' as well and is responsible for the exit scams of Agora and others.
