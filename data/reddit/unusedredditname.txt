It is ALWAYS legal to petition your government for redress. Even if you own a business.

I'm sorry, I'm not making my point clearly.
I'm saying that all the reasons you like bitcoin will disappear when they "enable it with Paypal."
If the goal is to simply get people using bitcoin, then why not ask the government to run the blockchain? Obviously because it undermines the very idea of bitcoin. The same could be said for the way ebay would very likely "enable" bitcoin with paypal.

You and I both understand that bitcoins are property (or at least a form of it), but I don't know of any government which treats them like watermelons.
If Bob stole my watermelons, I would call the police, tell them Bob stole my watermelons, and the police would (ideally) find them at Bob's house. At which point I would support my assertion of ownership of the watermelons originally (I run a watermelon store/have an invoice receiving them, have video of him leaving with the watermelons in his trunk).
However, if they police go to Bob's house, and he produces a receipt that says he bought the watermelons from me, my chances of recovering my watermelons is severely in doubt.
Applying this to bitcoin and an exchange, you tell the police Mark stole your bitcoin, and Mark has a receipt proving you sent your money (or coins) to him (his exchange).
Worsening matters, Mark (likely) pays out coin in large transaction, essentially mixing your coin into hundreds of transactions to addresses that branch off for miles. If Mark merely asserts that he paid out your coin to one of those addresses, the police would have to verify ownership of every address BTC was paid out to since you sent him your currency. Your only proof of request for payout is dependent upon the system he developed and controls.
As the laws stand, I'm having a real hard time thinking of what crime could be proven without raising new regulation. It's hard enough for the US government to keep up with IP theft/fraud/corporate espionage in the ever developing digital age, without a system being devised with the specific intent of confounding them.
IP theft is tricky since all that changed was a value in a ledger in the sky, if you owned the private key before, you still own it now, the only thing that changed is the world-wide consensus that your account was decreased and his account was increased. It's almost loss of reputation...? Even breach of contract is out, as I'm almost positive the terms of service included "NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSS OF ANYTHING EVER."
Even if everything went perfectly, you would see Mark in federal prison, but still be out your coin, as there is no way for any judicial system to award and initiate the return of BTC without the private keys.

Yes, assuming the buyer has trust of the artist.
My question then becomes, what was transacted?
Buyer provided fiat, seller provided art. This art (almost as if by design!) provides the buyer with information they can use to access the address with the Bitcoin. No Bitcoin moved during this transaction.
If a performance artist can eat his own hip, why can't I sell a social experiment where I share access to my Bitcoin and hope it doesn't get stolen. (Spoiler alert: it always gets stolen)
This does depend on the understanding that no one "owns" any public address, nor do they "own" the ledger balance associated to that public address. Each person merely happens to have the "access code" to decrease the value of that ledger entry.
The point of the correct horse battery staple was twofold; first, it's a silly and recognizable (heh) private key, and second, would we consider ourselves owners of the BTC at that address simply because we generated the "access code?"

I've been saying this for a long time.
**Don't compete with the existing system.**
**MAKE A NEW SYSTEM.**
Play up the fact that you don't "transfer" bitcoin from one place to another, there is simply a ledger which does +X and -X to accounts. (This is further supported by the multiple sources to multiple destinations transactions).
Remind people that they don't technically "own" an address, they simply have access to it. I don't "own" the "correct horse battery staple" brainwallet any more than everyone else who has generated it.
Bitcoins are entirely intangible and backed by nothing, stop trying to make them tangible and backed by something! I understand that exchanges which establish a conversion rate to fiat are a necessary evil, but they help create the idea that bitcoin is backed by something tangible.
We need to make bitcoin LESS serious (dare I say dogecoin) so TPTB will ignore it as it reaches critical mass among the people. Individuals will see the value even if congress and the banking industry doesn't. The only trade-off here is time.
Edit: **Stop trying to make bitcoin into a bank account/a currency/internet gold, and start explaining why it ISN'T any of those things.**

The unfortunate thing is that people view bitcoin as "not money."
If I go to someone's house with a briefcase and say, "Hey, here's that $14,000 we were going to spend tomorrow, it's safe here, right?" That person might freak out a little, and might ask questions like, Who saw you come here? Do other people know you're carrying around 14 grand in cash? Isn't that the briefcase you carry around ALL DAY? Are you sure no one else knows the code to it?
But if you tell them you're putting 21coins on your phone, then it's safe because MATH.
WE are the ones with the significant understanding of bitcoin to know what is safe and what is not safe, not newbies. Hot wallets and reused addresses (which i suspect op used) are not secure enough for 14 grand in coin.

I just hate marketing in general. As far as I'm concerned the functionality of a product should speak for itself whether it's a $10k website or a site written in 20 minutes on notepad.
I'm forcing myself to change this because I realize that I want my service to help as many people as possible, and in order to do that, I must make my message digestible and appealing to them.
I *owe it to them* to simplify the technical explanation of the service so they can understand why it's important.
On one level it's about "moar customers!" but on another, it's just about getting the message out to as many people as possible.
Your message is one that is shared in varying degrees across almost all economic and social statuses, however by marketing directly to one edge you ensure the rest of the spectrum will pass by what could have been very helpful to them.

Airbnb is committed to playing the game with every locality they can.

Because if someone steals it the onus is on the vendor accepting the card to check identity and the person the card was stolen from can get their money given back at the vendor's expense.

Asymmetric encryption algorithms have the power to "sign" messages, it might make more sense to include that.
Message from Alice to Bob signed by Alice's private key.
Bob (or the server hosting the message) confirms the signature matches the message with Alice's public key, and knows Bob definitely sent that message to Alice address (assuming Alice's address is included in the signature).
TL;DR Use bitcoin protocol to verify senders and recipients.

We're pretty far off the beaten path into speculation at this point.
To my original point: call it a currency, and they have regulatory boxes to put it in. Call it a money exchange, and they have boxes to put it in. We need to make the case that bitcoin is its own box, and while they're trying to figure out how (or IF) they can regulate it, bitcoin can grow.

@_date: 2014-06-07 18:12:48
Yes, very much so.
But since bitcoin was built to avoid being lorded over by a group or organization or corporation or government, forcing coin to be returned would defeat the whole purpose.
Bitcoiners need to be MORE UPFRONT ABOUT THE RISKS involved because there is no safety net. We need to be open about these threats because they're only going to get worse and more creative the bigger bitcoin gets.
2FA gives lots of warm and fuzzies, but it is still vulnerable to social engineering, sms interception, midnight password/email/phone number resets

Those are all very good points which I believe would be strongly considered by a fresh, agile upstart ready to take the market by storm.
Ebay is not that.
Ebay benefits from multiple hands touching each transaction (that's why they take a percentage at the auction and a percentage at the money movement), while I understand that reducing complexity in international transfers is preferred, they would be doing it for their own gain, and not likely passing on that savings to the buyer.
I agree that they are recognizing that bitcoin is *a potential* competitor with paypal, but I don't think they're chomping at the bit to cut one leg off their cash cow to try out this new-fangled currency internet thingy.
Another commenter said he thought this was just ebay calming their investors to the idea that bitcoin could compete, and that makes the most sense given their market position.

The IRS barely knows how it wants to tax BTC (yes, I know it *said* it knows), much less any accountant (particularly those who would actually say "Yes, I do know how to file your taxes with BTC, and will be happy to sign as your tax preparer.")
If you plan on going "legit" (whatever that means) then you need to be ready to produce receipts for your transactions (no, a blockchain TX is probably not going to do).
Regardless of state laws (colorado) marijuana is still federally illegal and I don't think I have to even bother saying you probably don't want to put "Illicit Botanical Transfer Associate" as your job title on your taxes.
It seems somewhat likely that BTCers will be visited and revisited by the tax man in a variety of ways over the next few years. If you've got coinbase hooked to your bank account which is hooked to your social, you may be able to do simply claim the gain off the sell price compared to the buy price without providing much detail, but I wouldn't count on it.
Honestly don't think they'll be gunning for BTC yet (except maybe a few big earners/spenders/miners to make examples), but whatever you declare will be permanently associated with you, and that's something to keep in mind.

I'm not sure I understand how you planned on establishing trust between the two of you for the transaction. He was going to give you access to the blockchain account so you could take ownership of it, but he exported the private keys and would initiate a transfer anyway?

This is very interesting. The internet has been run by ads since the beginning (much like TV shows are made so you'll watch commercials).
With bitcoin it is now possible to pay content providers amounts so small, that it isn't painful to do so.
Obviously I think good content providers should get good coin, but something like 1c or .5c per webpage becomes possible and easy to do. (assuming your viewers have coin)
And if it really caught on, .1c per page might still be enough to fund the content creators.

Hacking is all about attack vectors. The more opportunities you have to communicate with the phone the more chances you have to attack it.
If the phone sends usage data to the provider, that's an attack vector. If the phone accepts OTA updates, spoof a cell tower and deliver one. If he left his phone unguarded for a minute or two (or a friend crashed at his house for a night) there are lots of things you can install (regardless of OS) to monitor activity on phones.
Security is generally thought of as a strong front door, but the stronger the front door, the more appealing it is to search for other ways to get in.
Ultra unbreakable encryption? Ok, what does the encryption run on? Where is the memory stored? What are the channels it takes to move around? Who are the people who can access it when the password is typed in?

If a user trusts their phone with $14,000 and they give root access to "flappy bird live wallpaper FREE" they probably don't have $14,000 to begin with.
My point is a savvy user who trusts their closed source phone can still be targeted, and likely WILL be if they just loaded 14 grand onto it.
So if your point is dumb users who give root access to everything will lose the bitcoin they store on their phone, then congratulations, obvious point proven for all to see.
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:38:31
Potato tomato.
I agree getting root is always the goal, but for that reason root is usually heavily guarded. All those update mechanisms the provider installs HAVE root access, otherwise they'd only be able to manage the memory for their own app. These are much more tantalizing for that reason.
I do agree that attack was very likely targeted and not just a random sweep of some malware. For 14 grand I'd build a fake cell network access point and send a silent "update" myself...

Establishing ownership is important for levying taxes and fees.

Again, more attack vectors means more opportunity to execute remote code. Closed source means less security. Vendor flavors of android are well documented to have security problems due to their "features" which are "secure" because they're closed source.

This is really simple. Again, please Google around a bit.

No, that's if it goes through Google play.
The way you usually get roms on your phone is by rooting using a memory fault or buffer overflow to inject the command to grant root, then after only having root access, you plop your zipped install files straight on the filesystem (in a place you cant ge tto without root) and restart. The phone see a file named update.zip in the right place and runs it as root. Done.
Again, please try rooting or googling the process yourself.

Kind of. The wallet lets you scan in a private address and submit a transaction using it, then it doesn't store the address information.
This way it's not just sitting on your phone waiting to be swept up by malware, or subject to most of the usual concerns that should apply to hot wallet addresses.

These points need to be hammered into legislators' heads.
This is one of those critical differences in bitcoin that make regulation/taxation impossible. There is no transaction. There is no "to" there is no "from," Just accounts that go down, and accounts that go up. Change addresses further exemplify this. Did the change go to a new "change" address, or were the sources fully spent?
Who sent what to whom (grmr?) is not really a question that applies.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:18:04


Nope. Wouldn't do it. The *yeahbutwhatif* catch-all being I'd probably kill myself after I did it. Besides, if you have to survive by doing that, have *you* really survived? Would you really think you were worthy of passing on your genes after that decision?


Nope. I'd beg and plead and offer to work my fingers to the bone, but wouldn't steal. It doesn't belong to me, and it's neither possible nor relevant to know if the person I'm stealing from could "afford it."


If they offered it to me as their apple they gave freely, then yes. If they told me they stole it then no.


I don't think inanimate objects carry a history. If you got Hitler's watch and you needed to tell time, you could wear it without supporting his twisted worldview. I suppose the only degree that matters is your knowledge of the object's history.
Taking the above example, if I were to accept the stolen apple, then just before I bit into it, the thief said, *"Do you want to know where I got it? Because you might not like it..."* If I say, *"Nah, I'm sure it's fine"* then I'm willfully avoiding knowledge that might affect my principles, and I'm no longer being principled. This doesn't mean I need to question the source of all things, but if I become curious or something causes me to wonder, I must ask.


I guess this depends on what you're trying to accomplish. I hate to slippery-slope this, but if you accept a stolen apple, what's the difference in stealing the apple yourself (if anything, you're taking more responsibility for the act), or worse? Society tends to shrug helplessly when you can rationalize the breaking of principals, but because you can never know the complete story, you can never know if someone "can afford it" or "had it coming" or "deserved it."
Stealing a loaf of bread to feed your starving family is just fine so long as you remain ignorant to the fact that the merchant needed to sell every single loaf of bread to afford his daughter's medicine/grandmother's dialysis/oil to heat the homeless shelter he ran.
If the merchant really could "afford it" then he'd give it to you if he believed you really needed it.


At no point did I question the intelligence of those who accept welfare, I maintain plenty of people on welfare are quite intelligent and capable or working, as evidenced by HUGE success of the welfare-to-work plan under Clinton. Furthermore, you can find videos and blog posts about plenty of people who understand that someone else is paying for their rent/food/phone/etc. and will reply simple, "Don't hate the player, hate the game."
To put those people aside, and speak about those who legitimately believe they are getting money for nothing at the expense of no other person, AND assuming they would have a principled objection to this if they did know, it's the same as accepting an apple from someone unaware they stole it.
Where this concept gets muddy, is when a government actively advertises doling out taxpayer dollars as money given free of consequence, and actually hires people to seek out others to motivate them to sign up for the service. Both of which are happening now. This amounts to intentional deception on the part of the thief, in which case, the principled recipient is also a victim.


I may not expect them to understand, but I don't expect them to be devoid of curiosity. Assuming their curiosity hasn't already been satiated by the thief saying, "Oh, don't worry, it's a gift from me." But if they've ever heard, from any source, even the possibility that the money came from unwilling contributors, willfully ignoring that possibility is no different from refusing the history of the stolen apple.


I think they believe this because they don't believe recipients are principled and truly ignorant, or they do believe recipients are aware of the source and argue degrees of separation, or that they personally observe recipients are aware and don't care and/or are willing to celebrate the fact that they know and don't care.
I believe there is a small (SMALL) role the government can play in providing a safety-net, but we are at absolutely absurd levels, and could blindly slash-and-burn with little impact on honest recipients.


Nope. Someone setting up the false premise of A or B does not mean you must choose A or B. Assuming you have a conflict with your principles, you can choose not to choose. Someone made the game, and you're choosing to play it at the expense of others.
Enslaved gladiators in the Roman Coliseum forced to fight should not hate the fighting, they should hate who set up the premise that they must fight. I never said it would easy to throw down your sword, and allow yourself to be run through by the other Gladiator who is just "the player," but if you succeed, if you survive the Coliseum by being the one who runs through the slave who threw down his sword, have *you* really survived?
BTW, I REALLY appreciate the thoughtful engagement. Arguing like this helps us both develop our ideas.
Edit: I guess I should avoid any absolutes when I say I would never do something in a situation I've never been in, but by having these conversations and defending these arguments you offer some perspective on a situation you might find yourself in at some later date. This is far better than arguing that you were blindsided and when it comes time to reconcile your actions with your principles, offering "you weren't there man!" or worse, "I try not to think about it."

You make some good points, but I still think there's a distinction.
Intellectual property theft is prosecuted, it's hard, but it is, because the source code is proprietary, and is owned by a person or company.
If you are in posession of that exact same source code, then it's pretty easy to conclude that you stole it, but addresses are not proprietary.
This means if I transfer coin into the brain wallet of "correct horse battery staple" and it gets transferred out, it's because someone else knew/guessed/generated the private key. Is that theft? Technically, if you share a locker with someone, proving ownership or even theft of the contents is difficult.
Obviously, that brain wallet is an exaggeration, but the point remains. It's possible, (though extremely unlikely) that someone else generates exactly your private key. Who has what legal standing then?
This is more like the RIAA suing people who share the hex decryption key for the DVD encoding scheme. It's technically proprietary info, but it's still just a (relatively short) series of ones and zeroes.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:24:45
The potential of an "inside job" is particularly worrying on a system like BTC...
If BTC transactions are irreversible, what prevents an account manager from "cashing out" the company's holdings to one address?
Even if you had proof of someone doing this, it could be very difficult to prosecute or otherwise charge them with a crime (aside from IP theft?).
I understand managing the private keys a company held in its private pool (or "vault") is procedure to be manged by the procedures of the company, but what a tremendous liability...
Would you be able to set up a script to require multiple signatures for larger transactions? If not, couldn't a transaction "approver" simply approve 100 transactions at .9999 BTC? (assuming 1btc limit).

Never said attack was untargeted.
Zero days get bought and sold all the time, and they don't sell because they apply to one phone that one person has. Vendor android versions are much more insecure. This is history, not speculation.
If you'd ever rooted a phone, you'd know that you have to approve all the apps with root acess, and that you do it once per app, and usually only immediately after you install that app. Getting a pop up that says "tic tac toe free to play version requests root access to your device" is going to raise some alarm bells.
Simply rooting a phone does not make it insecure. It only makes it insecure to the apps you allow root access.

IMHO, accessibility is the main "problem" with bitcoin, not awareness. If someone has never heard of bitcoin before and you offer to tell them about it by knocking on their door randomly and handing out fliers, they'd probably regard you as they would a Jehovah witness.
What you're doing is essentially cold calling, and that is extremely hard even without the difficulty of explaining what a cryptocurrency is and how you can "own" an intangible thing.
I would recommend either a more targeted flier distribution, or allowing people to come to you in a public place (set up a table at a local event, wear a sandwich board at a street corner). Otherwise there are lots of development and writing opportunities that would probably do more good than most of those things.

Again, he reiterated, it wasn't all Katrina victims, nor all 9/11 families.
If you read the full quote with context, and still are upset with him, then 
OK. Otherwise, you should always go to primary sources.

Mycelium has a cold storage spending feature specifically so you won't have to transfer large quantities of coin to a smartphone wallet to spend them.
But I agree with the inside job thing. Either that or you're a big fish and a target for that reason. In that case smartphones are not to be trusted. So many vendor versions of android (esp. HTC) have severe security issues that are painted as "features."
Large quantities of coin necessitates large quantities of security. Rooted smartphone with cell antenna pulled, offline transaction creation with armory, or a multi sig wallet. 2FA online wallets will only get you so far when the social engineering aspect rears it's ugly head.

I believe humans are different from wild animals more than SOME degree.
I don't deny primal forces, in fact, my belief that we're more than wild animals requires acknowledgement and intentional refusal many of our primal forces.
I feel the evolutionary standpoint is overly practical to use it as an argument discussing principals.
If a coyote were starving and happened upon an abandoned coyote cub, it would eat it in a heartbeat, and live another day to pass on its genes.
If I were starving and happened upon an abandoned baby, I could hit it with a rock and eat it in order to live another day to pass on my genes.
This would make sense from an evolutionary standpoint, however this would also make me a wild animal. Since I'm not, I would rather starve than do this.
My long-winded point being that I think principals can (and should) cause us to deny what is "primal" or "makes evolutionary sense." If not principals, then something else, anything else, because if there is nothing which would cause a human to deny his animal urges, then your point is accurate, and man are no different from an animal.
EDIT: These are obviously extreme examples to make the point, and canibalism doesn't seem to apply to collecting welfare, but to some the argument could be made.

True enough. Most of the proposed regulation is meant to protect consumers from fraud. Cryptocurrencies are built to avoid exactly this.
The training wheels are off, you are free to fall off the bike, ride off a cliff, crash into a wall, or hand your bike to a thief for "safe keeping."
I can appreciate that this is new technology and is exciting, but watching people crave stability while day trading, or using their bitcoins in ways they'd (seemingly) never use their fiat is very disconcerting.

Cryptocurrencies offer anonymity, ease of transfer, security of not having to trust a third party, fungibility, a limited supply (or pre-scheduled creation), and personal "ownership" (as much as you can have for an intangible object).
There are benefits and draw backs to all forms of value (or "Money" if you want to play loose with terminology), and cryptocurrencies are a new invention populating an existing checklist of benefits and drawbacks.
Many things can be commodities (a gold bar for instance), but cryptocurrencies were designed to be currencies. We've only begun to scratch the surface of BTC as currency, right now it's mainly a commodity (as is evidenced by the above day-trading/losses/gains), so there's still a lot of potential in this new technology.
As for making money out of nothing, I'm sure you're aware that in the US, the dollar is no longer gold-backed, and the bernank-yellen is pumping 85 billion "into the economy" (banks who hold it) every single month for "quantitative easing" (who needs printing presses when I can just press zero on the keypad). This is another factor in the rise of cryptocoins.

Everybody wants something for nothing.
The system allows us to borrow in order to fund our cushy lifestyle. Everyone likes cushy lifestyles, hence, everybody likes the system.
America, in particular, needs to understand that we are floating atop a bubble on top of a bigger bubble, on top of a bigger bubble that started growing when we unpegged our dollar to a limited resource.
Anyone who advocates a return to the gold standard, or basically, any limited resource, (including bitcoin) is arguing for a reduction in their standard of living. There really isn't any other way.
Fortunately, automation and research funded by this bubble will make sure we don't go back to 1902 or something, but it will still be a big adjustment.
Couple this with the fact that globalization has linked the economies across the globe, and you begin to realize a standard of living reduction here will be the equivalent of a nuclear bomb in other countries. The valuation correction on the global market will cause people living in less wealthy countries to literally die for want of goods or services. With this in mind we can begin to see the true impact of these decisions.
Bitcoin is just the vehicle, it can't change the road we're on.

"Ownership of what?" is exactly my point.
While I agree that "regulators gonna regulate" we need to make a distinction between a public address and a bank account. If money goes to a bank account that I opened, then I received it, and may be required to explain where it came from.
If bitcoin arrives at a public address, then the public address owns it. Anyone who has access to that address may use it, but that person didn't provide a social security number, driver's license, or fingerprint to get access to that address.
What is the banking equivalent of the "correct horse battery staple" brainwallet? I suggest there isn't one, and we should stop trying to make bitcoin into a bank account/a currency/internet gold, and **start explaining why it ISN'T any of those things.**

If you don't care about X% of your coins then sure, why not. If 10,000 coins are 1% of your holdings and you don't care, then more power to you.
But if you plan on spending the coin at a fiat price, then your concern for the amount of coin stored on devices with questionable security should increase in proportion to the coin's exchange rate.
I can understand where you're coming from but you can't expect to store a quantity of coin on a hot wallet that you are unwilling get to lose. Basic stuff, even early on.

You got it. No argument there.


You lost me. You can either have government oversight of a market or you can't. And before you say "but theft is theft" no, not in this case it's not. A bitcoin is intangible, and the value of each "coin" (address) varies based on consensus. You can't steal consensus, and you can't send the po-po to take back a series of numbers and letters.
Futhermore, bitcoin was DESIGNED to be anarchic cowboy western bullshit. Just because people aren't used to being 100% in charge of their money, and there being ZERO government imposed safety net, doesn't mean the system needs oversight.
Totally agree with you on the selective enforcement of the law. It's nonsense, but you need to understand our justice system is nowhere NEAR able to apply a legal standard of ownership to bitcoin.
And untraceable means exactly what I think it means. All that is required to receive bitcoin is to get an address to someone. You can do this as anonymously as you want.

Bitcoin doesn't need a complicated guide to be 99.999% secure.
It needs a simplified guide to being 98.2% secure, with a warning not to put your life savings (!) into it ~~until you understand the advanced guide~~ ever.

My point is that they can regulate all they want, but if they can't enforce it, what does it matter?
We should direct our efforts toward showing them why it's pointless to attempt to regulate Bitcoin because it's not what they think it is.

YES. THIS IS WHY BITCOIN. Why do you think it was designed to be trustless, without centralization, using impartial math instead of consensus, and pseudonymous?
Just think about this for more than a few seconds.
Illicit activity: Defined by whom? I can sell you coins and claim they were stolen and should be marked "tainted." I can transfer by business's coins, and release a presser saying they were stolen and should not be processed to build my story. Unless the person stolen from and the thief agree it was theft, there's no way to prove it in a pseudonymous system.
Defrauded: Yes, life is hard. Life's harder when you're stupid.
Conspiring with thieves: Defined by whom? Say you want to buy some coin, and link up with someone on localbitcoin, receive coins for payment, and discover these coins are "tainted." No malice, no conspiracy, yet a victim.
I agree the exchanges are private entities and may do as they please, but would you be fine with them all participating in an oligopoly, which fixes rates and decides who gets to buy and sell what coins?
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:59:44
Everything you said is accurate, and I do agree, yet the reality of bitcoin being pseudonymous and a third party establishing who stole what from whom is still a question. Applauding reclassification of fungible assets in the form of "taint" and passing judgement on those things is entirely within your power, but is not appropriate.
Smashing the window becomes much more apt a comparison when the person who wants to smash it says he owns the car, and needs to get in to get his spare key. What do you do when two people show you title to the car, and one asks for your help smashing the window, and the other accuses the first of being a thief? (Both the thief and original owner would have the private key to the stolen wallet)
Maybe if the thief had two friends vouching for him and a mother and her child, and he said he needs to get in quickly, because his baby daughter is in anaphylactic shock and needs the epi-pen inside. (Big press releases, public assertions of theft, accusations, etc)
Again, you have the right to do or not do as you choose, as do the privately owned exchanges, but the assignment of taint to a coin (even if it's deserved) is ridiculous, and serves to create multiple "tiers" of coin which, by extension would have different values. Bitcoin is a technology. It is amoral. Assigning morality to it in any semi-official capacity is ridiculous.
EDIT: Oh yeah, mixing makes taint impossible to determine.

I disagree that multisig and hardware wallets are better solutions to zero conf spending when child pays for parent can offer the same nuclear option when coupled with replace by fee.
IMHO multisig and hardware wallets are always going to be somewhat complicated and require more knowledge on the part of the user, whereas the nuclear option need only be executed by people protecting large wallets (big fish who should take security seriously) and merchants who need to defend themselves against double spends.
The barrier to entry remains low for a new user since he, being a good actor, need not worry about the nuclear option that protects merchants from bad actors and big fish from sophisticated theft.
All my humble opinion, if you disagree, I'd like to hear your reasoning.

This is a *tad* hyperbolic.
Instant transactions are not necessary for a wide range of exchanges. While there are many day-to-day cash/card transactions we perform after which we do not expect/want to stand around for 10-30 minutes, there are plenty where we do.
Paying for ongoing service, paying for entry to an event or venue, ongoing payer/payee relationships, we even expect to hang around restaurants after we pay.
Your statement also discounts the very concept of the blockchain, which, if you cannot agree is revolutionary in its own right, I can't help you.

Peter Todd publicly posts a double spend script that he says succeeds very reliably.
I agree that replace by fee is inevitable if only for the miners acting in their own monetary interest.
Zero conf transactions do not have PoW. They're not secure. Deal with it.
EDIT: BTW, replace-by-fee can make wallet theft a thing of the past... [Just sayin'](

I think there's a lot of power in the multisig methods, but there's too much overhead for what used to be a quick exchange of cash or a card swipe. For ongoing transactions and high dollar transfers, yes the overhead is worth the time, but for the somewhat large day to day transactions with random retailers who are going to hand management of this new technology to low skill cashiers, multisig is too much hassle on both sides.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:33:32
Consensus is not Proof of Work.
Even bitpay calls instant transactions ["High Risk"](
I more or less agree that zero confs are very useful and that it is in the general interest of the miners to make zero confs as strong as possible, but bitcoin WILL become larger, and it WILL become profitable enough for a group to put some money behind subverting the memory pool consensus.
The question is do we want zero confs to suffer now or when Bitcoin's 10x larger?

Brainwallets and salts:
Use [diceware]( to generate a series of random words as the beginning of your passphrase. Memorize them. This is the only hard part.
ADD to that passphrase personalized data individual to you: Your name, your phone number, your SSN, your address, whatever, so long as it adds length, isn't common information, and is easy for you in particular to remember.
ADD to that custom info such as the wallet name you may save the public key under.
You now have a very long phrase, with random words, personalized info that's easy for you to remember and hard for others to guess, and a wallet name.
Example: warren boson zzzz hive hat roof final jacob jennifer jones 1-234-456-7890 cold wallet 1
Subsequent wallets are generated with different wallet names: cold wallet 2, long term 1 and public keys are labeled as such.
You're ridiculously strong against brute force attacks, you're strong against random word generator attacks, and your only difficulty is memorizing 7 words instead of 16.
You'll need an offline device (laptop, android phone, etc) to digest the passphrase into the key and generate the QR codes so you can transfer the keys to hot devices without connecting it to a network.
NOTE: If you are a big fish, you will likely be subject to targeted attacks by people who will buy your social security number, address, phone numbers, first pet names, etc. Recommend multi-sig no matter your security measures.

I'll alert Satoshi that solved the double spend problem and perfected instant transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:49:10
There's a reason the blockchain and proof of work were both revolutionary ideas that solved a problem cryptography experts had been working on for decades.
Ignoring all that because you've built a double spending consensus alarm that syncs across nodes is asking for trouble.

Describing the systems and processes in place to monitor the double spending issue, detailing how impossibly rare it would be, and then offering to sell the customer insurance doesn't even pass the smell test.
So long as "instant transactions" and "no chargebacks" both have asterisks you're going to have a hard sell for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:46:36
There's a difference between relying on the block chain and proof of work and saying, "It's secure enough, we have a consensus network! The PoW and block chain are formalities."
Bit pay doesn't even agree with risk assessment of instant transactions...
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:33:53
With or without the customer needing a matching wallet or the need to pre-pay? I'd seen some of this escrow-style holding, but only with hosted wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:38:51
Ha! No, it is not illegal to lie to a police officer who is engaging you to determine probable cause, and it is certainly not a felony. (Please provide source if possible)
You cannot lie under deposition or oath (perjury), and it IS almost always illegal to lie in almost any way to a federal official. That communication should all take place through your lawyer.

Accepting instant transactions is not the same as confirming tramsactions. Bit pay does not have the power to force instant confirmations, so they're likely assuming the risk of a double spend.
For a cup of coffee or even a meal, this is not a huge deal, but if I spend $200 on groceries or buy a $500 television it can be a huge deal. Transactions with a short time between payment and disengagement is the rough patch. A gas station doesn't expect their customers to fuel up $100 of gas, scan a code and sit in their car for 10 minutes or more. Likewise the station is not willing to simply eat $100 on a double spend, and bitpay would probably drop them from instant payments after the first few thousand dollars.
Edit: Bitpay itself calls "instant" transactions "high risk." There is a reason for this.

@_date: 2015-02-10 01:39:44
That's part of why I want to get into this. Consumers fail to realize who gets screwed by the cc companies and fraud and chargebacks, and like you said, they pay for the privilege.
This is why it bugs me to see companies doing transactions without proof of work. Even if they eat the double spends, it's not scalable, and the more they build their own "instant" consensus outside proof of work the more they're asking for attacks on that consensus network. People are stretching the rules instead of working within them.
@_date: 2015-03-21 12:25:28
YAY! If only we also had some other type of recourse! Maybe like a bitcoin SEC or a bitcoin FBI to track who owns what coin and receives "bad" coins!
Maybe later we can get FDIC insurance to protect against losses! OH! And a bitcoin federal reserve!!!
I, for one, welcome our new exchange overlords.

Fedgov has this, keycards physically attached to the person that lock the PC when the card is removed (IE you get up and walk away)
More advanced ones put the actual cryptographic key on the card, and use it to actively decrypt certain files (though I don't think you could do the whole HDD and read the card for every file request)

Quantum computing breaking ECC would probably kick off several hundred wars before bitcoin was even considered as a target.
It would basically lay bare every secret exchanged for decades.

Since the IRS has a q&amp;a with Forbes on bitcoin which I summarize here:


It seems likely more American companies are going to find themselves paying out of country individuals who are really in country. Those darn jobs going "overseas..."
Bitcoin supports identifiction through message signing, so technically it doesn't matter even that the communication come from the same email address.
You get engaged for ongoing consulting, manage communitions through one address then at delivery sign the message from the address receiveing payment and include the next address in the signed message. Then initiate communication from another channel with the first message signed and repeat.

I'm guessing you've never worked LP.
No proprietor gets to threaten customers for something they might not have done. It's kind of bad for business. No cop is going to hook up anyone for "felony double spend" and even if they did, no DA is going to go to court on it.
I'm not sure I was clear on the attempted doublespend. I get my bill for $500 for my bigscreen. I scan my code with one wallet and hit send. It gets received in seconds, and as I'm wheeling out I hit send on my other wallet with a quadrupled miner fee and cross my fingers. If it fails I can return my tv and blame teh haxxorz and pick a new store or show my friend how to do it. If it succeeds, the tv cost me the extra mining fee.
Edit: I should say, "Or similar" because there are going to be wallets made to give you the best chance of pulling off your doublespend.
Edit 2: Doublespends are real. Like it or not. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:57:36
You're underestimating how hard people try to get a free lunch. When btc catches on there are going to be hundreds of tutorials online on "how to get a free bigscreen" and they're going to have more views than any video expla in in how hard a double spend is. This ecosystem is going to evolve, and it hasn't seen even moderate adoption yet.
Besides, you can explain to retailers how difficult a double spend technically is, but all they'll hear is, "You might not get paid and have no recourse."
As to the odds, even if 10% of the bad actors get away with the double spend, how much lost money do you think it will take for a retailer to cry uncle?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:29:07
The confirmation time is not acceptable for certain types of transactions, and forcing others to use a matching service for transfers (like coin base to coin base transactions) for (technically) instant transactions is not scalable or desirable given a customer will be expected to transact with many retailers who have those types of transactions.
The other bit is just an android widget that reports changes to a single or set of addresses. A quick glance widget of your wallet balance and possibly a chime when payments arrive (mostly for tips or donations). If you or anyone has seen something like this already available I'd be happy to save myself the trouble. I know the bit coin wallet has a widget but you can't add addresses to it. It doesn't seem to trust you to manage your keys on your own.
