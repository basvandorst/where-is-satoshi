Bitcoin literally changed the online gaming world. From legal sites to not-so-legal sites it provided a super simple way for US players to still enjoy an ounce of freedom.
God Bless Bitcoin for what it has done to online gaming.

Silk Road had sex slavery? Really? I didn't know that.
Weapons? Sure, but those are known to be scammers or a fed for the most part. These listings aren't taken seriously. Hitmen? Give me a fucking break. Although, they did exist..just like ManBeef once existed.
The show is killer and I understand you have to spice it up for TV, I'll let it slide.
But to say that was legit? haha comon now.

Bitcoin would be great for such things but it goes to show that such organizations are still lacking in terms of technology. The "Encryption breeds planning grounds for terrorists!" mindset. While they communicate using PSN. It's all bullshit.
On top of that, WU and MG are the primary methods for scammers all over the nation. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:49:30
Yes they do (work for an app) but it's very spotty. They downloaded our app, moved around it a bit, used a main feature, used the facebook integration feature and made sure that was up to standards and backed out. They were in our app for maybe 20 minutes (based of their behavior) 
With something like this, they aren't going to deposit any coin. It's going to be very basic.
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:33:09
Well this is usually the norm. More support staff doesn't mean better support staff. I would say you're probably right and they are strapped for cash. Whoever is left in support is taking on double the amount of work.

Support is an area in which many companies overlook. The majority of support these days is done via email in combo with a ticketing system whether in house or via a service, live chat etc. 
I wouldn't be surprised if CB just doesn't care too much for its support department and neglects it. Or they have bad management in that area.
Either way, a delay like this could cost some serious cash and you're right..if they neglect this area of their business what else are they neglecting that we can't gauge success on..

Wow really? 
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:22:04
Yes, you should avoid using CB. I stopped using them after they refused to allow for instant purchases long after companies like Circle were allowing it..using them just didn't make sense anymore. 
Yesterday, they showed up to the party but it's far too late.
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:34:47
Picture this -
You as a business are still allowed to protect your network and the users on the network - but at any point in time, the "Government" is allowed to either access your data, or you are required to hand over the keys and say nothing. The sickening part is that they do this now but instead of using law to force you, they use gangster tactics. 
They need a stamped law to back up their bullshit and this is it right here.

I really wonder when a group of people file a class action against this type of behavior. If bitcoin goes any further, we are about to see it become a huge part of our lives and closing accounts without notice and the refusal to explain is really pathetic. Wouldn't be very hard to show damages.
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:10:38
Stop sending directly to any of those wallets. Don't send from Circle to DNM, Gambling or any wallets you don't want anyone to know about. Send to your own wallet, rinse repeat until satisfied. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:37:55
@_date: 2016-04-07 16:23:40
I agree but I think when sending small amounts to a poker site, Circle  nor LE is going to pay much attention unless you are already a high profile target. In that case, I think it's "good enough" to send from Circle to your wallet through a few different addresses and then off to the site your are playing on. I hate saying "good enough" when talking about privacy but hey..

@_date: 2015-12-03 21:18:12
Very well put and I completely agree. 
I would add on to that and say that CB is positioning itself as the leader of BTC tracking and surveillance 
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:58:54
But to say that using Tor makes you more suspicious is wrong. Sure, Tor traffic can be monitored and blocked but traffic cannot (at least at the level we are speaking of) be analyzed. Would you rather "stand out" as simply some user using Tor or have all traffic analyzed with ease?
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:46:20
I wouldn't say that. I would say his comments are very interesting regarding his departure from the DEA. I think it shows quite a bit in terms of his mental status. This dude was seriously off his fucking rocker - he really believed he was an untouchable. 
I still believe that cases he has been involved in should re-opened and investigated including DPR.

The first statement makes no sense though. This has been done, is currently happening, and we don't see anyone abandoning any ship for another. In my experience, anyone who owned LTC, also owned BTC.

I haven't seen anything stated publicly. I imagine behind closed doors they are at least talking about it and the move to bring Casares in is a good indication they are leaning towards bringing on a BTC platform in the future.

Do we know if he ever went that route first?
@_date: 2016-03-28 16:20:36
Yes, but I wasn't looking at CB support as a whole, you were. I was simply responding to a comment about having a lot of customers and that's why they aren't so great at support. 
I am sure overall they have a good numbers. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 21:26:14
You're trying to say that I came up with some sort of specific resolution to this matter and I didn't. I don't know what action CB should take exactly, that's up to them, but they should be in response. 
Yes, I understand the issues we have with banks on weekends..but maybe you want to be just like the banks and don't think startups should act differently..that's up to you though.

That's a really shitty way to look at it. 
You should look at it like a Fat Finger Error and a user SHOULD be able to cancel a transaction because humans make mistakes, what if it was much larger than 900 and the user has a large limit? Comon now. 
This isn't about the mistake, it's about the response to the mistake.
Once again, we are seeing that Coinbase support is seriously lacking. They should be avoided.
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:16:19


I don't think so at all. Having "a lot of customers" is no excuse to lagging or lacking in your Customer Support Department. In fact, this should cause you to have some of the best support you can offer as it should be an area of focus for them. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:22:07

Sorry, maybe my wording was wrong on that. Yes, I understand how OB works. 
My point was that we already have names, a contact, a point of interest. The people involved are necessarily anons that the FBI will have to search for..if you think OB couldn't be shut down or the creators attacked, you may not understand how this all works..

I don't think I am qualified enough to push out theories on what exactly could be done to shut down OB from a technical standpoint but I don't believe that's the only way to "shut it down". I also don't put it past our Government, if OB gains enough traction, to step in and pull some shady moves to make such a thing worthless.

See, this is where things get a little..bumpy in the road. I obviously am not going to change your mind so I don't feel like taking the time in attempting to do so. So we can move on from that.
Also, yes, if we look at Ross and say "This man deserves a life sentence for his part in creating this platform" we should also be looking at other site operators where users are engaging in the transfer of money for illegal content. Should we not? 
Now, I understand you may believe that you understand this case fully, and I can sit here and say that 100% you do not and either do I as a ton of evidence was withheld and not allowed during the trial. We don't even know nor did the jurors the entire story. Yet..this young man is serving a life sentence for creating - not selling - a platform that was used by its users for selling illegal contraband. 
If you believe Ross should be in jail for the rest of his life you believe that a ton of other site operators should also be in jail for life..such as the creators of Napster as a better example.

I didn't sell..but I just never bought.
I was told about Bitcoin from my boss during the very, very early days. He was mining in his closet. He tried to explain and even showed me the basics but I didn't know what the fuck I was looking at and jsut didn't want to get involved..
Later I realized how easy it was but said "$40 for a coin!? no way
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:54:34
but it's not very far fetched at all. Sure, it's speculation but combine that with the fuckery that was Libya and it makes more sense. 
As of now, the Drone Papers are coming from an unidentified source yet the information is quite believable and documents back it. 
In this case, the email is pretty damning and it brings to light that this was a pretty big issue for us.
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:08:18
I don't think that's very ridiculous at all. We all know that our tax dollars are extremely misused. Projects are dragged out for years for no apparent reason other than to keep the budget up and politicians are getting fat bonuses..
Imagine it though for a second..you have a company and people are forced to buy your product..no matter what. They HAVE to purchase your services or face a fine..what incentive as a company do you have to ensure that your services are top notch when people can never cancel? 
If you want to see, take a look at the USPS (Not forced, I understand) or the DMV. Please tell me those two are efficient. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:12:46
That came much later when I realized it wasn't so difficult to buy/sell BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:59:52
You're right, they seem to do very well with delivering but that is simply once aspect of their service. I've had lost mail before (I receive and ship very often) and when it comes to their customer support, it's almost unbearable..
They are also not even required to deliver your mail, that's a fun fact. 
But again, I am not calling for the abolishment of the USPS. We have private sector options that serve very well. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 00:36:56
Oh Canada..
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:45:37


Lots of services are inefficient. The larger they become the more inefficient they seem to become..but we still have the choice not to purchase their product and that was my point. Those companies are always innovating either way. 
The USPS is a nightmare. Slow customer service, horrible employee treatment, rising rates and an extremely shaky financial state, the USPS is far from efficient. 
Actually AAA does a great job at taking care of being the go-between with the DMV when you need certain tasks completed. 
However, I am not saying we should replace these services with the private sector.

This was an argument I found myself in many times when discussing Trump. 
"He went bankrupt multiple times, how successful could he be?"
I think it comes from a lack of understanding. I grew up in the start up world. I've seen many products launch and many products fail..even with great leadership and a bucket full of genius in the room. It's part of the game.

We also live in a state that believes they can withhold evidence from a trial and that should be acceptable.

Yes, because he was a vendor..he was not just a buyer. It's quite obvious he was getting his supply from another wholesale vendor on a market. They were probably tracking all packages to his residence/box whatever. They found the care package, made a controlled delivery and got him in possession. 
Again, the case you linked to is not a buyer but a vendor.

You're spouting off nonsense. If you have paid any attention at all you already know that the FBI and the DEA are not interested in the buyers. They are interested in the market owners, admins and vendors and I agree with their position on focusing resources on the "real" targets and not some low level buyer. 
Also, you may be uneducated on how intense an investigation is when it deals with darknet stuff.
Either way, educate yourself before you make such silly comments.

I'd stay away from SWC. Although I hear that their games are super soft - traffic is low
Look at ACR (deposits/withdraw in BTC, play USD) or Betcoin.

It's a complicated issue and I understand this. We fed ourselves our poison on this one by begging for big names to throw their hat in the ring. Something I will say I did't want from the beginning.
I would like to see a simple model applied to bitcoin. If Bitcoin is sold, that cash is simply income and viewed as such for tax purposes.
@_date: 2016-02-16 03:14:42
You're extremely confused. What a genius.
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:53:55
To be quite honest, I enjoyed Bitcoin when the idea stood firm that it was against the "mainstream" if you will. I think that's one the reasons we saw traction early on. Bitcoins foundation is very anarchist and I don't mean that in a bad way.  I want big banks out, trust worthy start ups in and people to accept the fact that Bitcoin is not fiat and it's not commodity.
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:55:37
No, I think that big bankers out of Japan will be able to manipulate the market, and NOT receive jail time :) 
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:16:53
and how was that information obtained? We don't even know..except for the fact that these two agents were involved in the theft of evidence the entire time. This isn't a separate issue, it's all entangled. How can you trust these two officers to collect and maintain legitimate evidence? 
@_date: 2016-09-15 18:00:12
Challenged accepted.
1) Fire Up Kali Linux machine
2) Order a Frap.
3) Send it back, bitch added too much creamer
4) Open Terminal - oh we cooking now!
5)....can't tell you the rest. OPSEC bruh.

Never 100% sure about that type of shit but I assume so.

I think what it was showing is that at some point in the future we will see a competing coin, different than all current alt-coins in that it attempts to NOT fix bitcoins issues but to make the holes bigger by design.
This would allow the world to keep their crypto-currency addiction while gaining complete control over the distribution, regulation and implementation. 
It's the New World Order for currency and I think we will see it. Sooner than later
We had the Federal Reserve in the early 1900's and we will have its sister system in the future that deals with digital currency.

@_date: 2016-09-15 19:10:48
lol I don't think so.
I think the coin that will be the one to accomplish this will be a coin developed in the open by a major organization. This will happen right in front of our eyes.
@_date: 2016-09-09 23:19:21
You're viewing it as a profit statement. 100 stores that bring in 12 million = what company is worth. 
Instead it's more like 
"Hi, my name is Mr. Chase, and I think this company is worth 1 billion dollars based off of current status, goals and these expectations."
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:17:24
That was that starts with an M and ends with a O..hh my god it's gonna be better that BTC.

Ok so first, I understand your concerns. Although I do believe he should watch his wording, I don't believe he is a bigot towards religion or any races. Remember, trump was never attacked with these claims prior to running and he has and still is surrounded by non-whites, some with high positions in both his companies and campaign. 
I'll also say that his attitude towards illegal immigration is one I agree with and is not concerning of legal immigrants living in the US. I also agree with his refugee stance as we cannot follow the route some nations in Europe have taken. It's just not a safe play for us as a country. 
I also don't like to compare any candidate to Hitler or any other totalitarian dictator.

WU and MG are both becoming dinosaurs in the money transfer world. They will survive for as long as users still see the value of their service. However they will die when either another (hello) option becomes MORE convenient or the fees become outrageous (as they are). 
 
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:30:14
Is there a place where we can view that info?

Thank you. If I am reading this right it's up to 60k+ now..
I am sorta new to all this but the last two transactions I've done had problems with getting "stuck" for a longer than usual period of time - it's quite frustrating.
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:39:01
I have nothing against Alt-Coins but this is seriously so pathetic. 
Oh Repubs accept BTC? Guess we can't? 
What? What? GTFO libtard.

Are they doing this on US accounts as well?
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:36:12
Exactly. This is all hype to jump on people who still have trust. 
Unless the user holds the only keys and the user alone - it may as well be unencrypted.
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:27:17
Sure. However, in the end, Digital Currency is what they (the ones doing the tracing) want. Over time I imagine we will see a significant increase in the ability to track transactions.

The alternative is to vote Trump - which I will be doing. 
It's extremely clear that he is not wanted from those who we already do not trust and now know, are extremely corrupt. 
A vote for Hillary is literally a vote for someone who we know is a criminal politician. Simply follow the email dumps..her campaign needs to be disqualified and she needs to see the inside of a jail cell.
@_date: 2016-10-16 03:40:20
I agree but I think bitcoin is still extremely foreign to most..a digital currency? They don't trust it. Online Poker is a great example. Most in the early days had no trust. As time went on and real money was made, it became a part of everyone's daily life. 
Bitcoin still hasn't had its day. It will. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:47:21


I'm  not sure how to respond to that. We don't know that. There is no physical proof of that. There have been allegations, yes..but I wouldn't go as far as saying he should see jail time..what exactly would you lock him up for? when we have no evidence of these abuses taking place.
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:28:25
Very much so! 
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:46:18
I don't really think you can have two positions on this and I really don't believe there are two different discussions on this matter. You say it's effective and by doing so, you justify the existence of the program. Simple as that. After all, that is their argument as well. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:24:33
Now I don't know for sure, but I could guarantee that after such an attack the mastermind would most likely have been identified via sources or even straight out taking responsibility for it as history has shown us that they love to do. 
That's still a very small example of why we should have blanket surveillance world-wide and IMO, worthless.  
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:24:14
This guy must have some serious problems. Did he really believe someone could just step out and say hey I am SN and not have to provide some solid proof? That's fucking insane to think that way.

Not surprised from a writer on SA. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:39:02
This is mostly correct. This is why their system is entirely fucked. 
When you pull in and store as much data as they do there is no possible way to find or detect any threat that may be lurking about. on time to stop it. There is just too much data. It would take days and days before they were able to find a shred of data that would lead them to even more data that may lead to a plan of attack.
They aren't doing this to stop terrorism - it can't get much clearer than that.

In the online pet buying world, it's so extreme it's not even worth trying to find a breeder who will ship an animal. MoneyGram is their way of getting the cash.

@_date: 2016-07-12 17:56:53
Actually, I don't believe it is.
Fax is horrible. It's not secure, it's slow, it's faulty and for the most part the quality is complete shit. Yet...it's still WANTED. In Telecom Fax is still considered a feature because customers actually want it..yet they hardly use it. 
It's been pinned as a necessary feature to a phone system for so long customers feel like if they don't have it, they are missing something.
Fuck a Fax.

@_date: 2016-07-12 18:53:14
Right! It's also still highly used in the medical field, sometimes insurance and even in telecom when moving numbers from one carrier to another.

@_date: 2016-07-06 00:34:54
It totally is and I can understand your position on this. I don't think it's right either.
However, we have to remember that CB is no longer just an exchange allowing you to buy and sell coin. They really are trying to be a "bank" and because of this they are a little bit more "involved" with what you are doing.
If you care about privacy (them knowing what you are doing) or being anon, you really shouldn't be using CB..or any exchange and you should be looking at OTC trading.
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:55:47
Credit Cards are not totally safe, so we can stop with that right now. 
Sure, you have someone to run to and complain to, but that doesn't mean a damn thing. You're at risk constantly when you continuously swipe your card at retailers. 
Also, not all CC's are free, you're thinking of Debit Cards which are totally different in terms of use.
