Get your monies into an exchange then and buy when it hits the new low and show signs of recovery. It's going to be a rocky road though and no one really knows where this is going. I'm happy trading dips ATM so even though the btc value might drop I'm increasing  my holding to offset.

Can set alerts in the coinbase app. Not a perfect match with Gdax figures but better than nothing.

Same happened to me. Watch it go from 14k euro to 8.8k something. Thought enoughs enough and I'll sit on the side in fiat for now. Bought straight back in again as I sold right at the bottom of the dip. Fml

Bought some more. Hopefully that's the last of the plummet

If you are nervous AF and you aren't even in the cryto game yet then I don't think it's going to be right for you if I'm honest.

Both my ETH transfer Into gdax is still pending and my Euro sell market order from 2 hours ago!! Stuck pending with zero fill and no way to cancel it. Meanwhile price has plummeted another €1k

Just need my bank transfer to complete today so I can buy some more!

Because I sold ��
Nah no one knows but it bounced back up and hasn't returned to those levels yet.

Already in fiat this time fortunately. Buy back in later for some extra coins hopefully. Or knowing my luck it'll be 19k again by the time I come out of the doctors :/
