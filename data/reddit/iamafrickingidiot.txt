It *did* get me. I'm posting screenshots etc below tracking my transaction, but I've come to the same conclusion as you: all the accounts sharing positive experiences have *just* enough history to pass a casual inspection, while all the negative comments are getting downvoted.
I'll continue to update and post verification if it works out, but until that happens and/or unless someone does the same, I'm going to assume I've been scammed.

As one of those who got scammed, I agree it probably wouldn't have helped. If I had come in an hour later than I did I would have seen the warning posts, but they still would have been at the bottom, downvoted by the sock puppets. 
However, if the scores had been visible, the disparity might have been clearer to see - i.e. if all the scam posts had +20 and all the sane warnings -20, most people could clearly figure out that there was some manipulation going on.

The fact you posted "Don't freak out check your email" *one minute* after I happened to receive an email makes me as suspicious of you as all the other pro comments on here.
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:00:11
That's great for you! Can you post screenshots or *anything* to reassure all us tinfoil-hat wearers?
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:43:46
Yep, see my comment below. Unfortunately I suffered a momentary lapse in my sense of smell, and took a big ol' bite.
If it works out for me I'll happily post screenshots as proof and advocate for them all day, but right now I feel like a total fool.

It seems moot now, esp. as the thread has been removed, but just to close the saga: 
5 hours on, no money and no further contact.

Edit: THIS IS A SCAM AND THE FUCKERS GOT ME. 
I have a horrible feeling I've just been taken by a scam after following this thread's advice.
12.45pm EST I sent 4.57 BTC.
TX is confirmed but the website hasn't updated and nothing has been received through PayPal. Of course it was only AFTER I hit send that I started questioning why I'd just sent nearly $2000 to a site I'd never heard of before this thread... and a little research since has only heightened my fears.
I will update live with my results, but I highly recommend caution.

Actually as I've said in a few other comments, the voting system might have helped raise red flags through a disparity between votes on sock puppet/genuine comments as the thread developed, but other than that I don't blame votes at all for this.

Here's what I am seeing on the exchange site: 
And [here's the TX on the Blockchain](
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:34:50
Interesting... how many hours after your original deposit did the Paypal credit come through?
It's been 10 hours for me now. They haven't replied to my emails either. As noted by OhMyMemories above, it seems they might let through smaller transactions to lull you into a false sense of security. Maybe my 4.57 BTC is just a keeper. In a way I'm glad, if it had gone through I might have staked a lot more next time!
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:34:39
As does the fact your comment just got upvoted above all the cautious/warning comments from the past 2+ hours *in six minutes*.
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:28:15
Yep, I take full responsibility for not doing the due diligence.
I'll keep updating here but I'll also post a separate thread (when enough time has passed that my remaining 1% hope of seeing my money has expired) with my experience/updates that might help future chumps avoid the same mistake.
At this point I think that's about as much lemonade as I can make with these lemons.

Update: 2.03pm I received [a confirmation email] ( 
No funds yet. Website states 'worst case scenario is 4 hours delay'.

It would be nice if it had *not* been removed from the sub. I did a search on them, and didn't see anything directly calling the exchange out as a scam, which would help prevent a lot of people from taking the risk.
My guess is that if this thread is removed too, weeks or months later there'll be another, with a few more suckers like me...
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:34:29
Probably. 
The sock puppets were making sure their positive comments were upvoted when sorted by 'best', and any warnings were downvoted. Visible scores would have made that disparity pretty obvious, especially early in the thread when an unrealistically high/low vote # would have stood out like a sore thumb.
