You replied to a comment about CLOUD nodes and how its important to have physical possession of the hardware their running on.  Not a comment on how to securely run any nodes.

He was saying it was unsafe to run it on hardware you dont directly control.  Vm wouldnt keep you safe on hardware you dont control.  Obviously a vm is best when you control the hardware, that point wasnt up for debate, only that you should be the owner of the hardware.

You didnt explain anything you only made the statement "what about a trusty vm" in the middle of a conversation about the dangers of cloud services.

So you just go around making random statements in conversation threads?

He saying the cloud isnt safe, your saying but a trusty vm isb as in a 3rd party cloud solution is safe as long as you use a vm.  Were saying the hardware needs to be in your posession.  Having a vm on your home machine is different than using a vm on a 3rd party cloud service.  Your statement doesnt delinate that and says that a vm on a 3rd party cloud service should be safe.  No one said vms arent safe were saying be in physical control of the hardware the node is running on, software is irrelevant.

sorry "have them".  It was a conversation about cloud hosting, not the os/software that its on, but having physical possession of the node, even if your running a vm on a home server your still in possession of it.  No one cares about vm, linux, windows or whatever, the conversation was solely about physical possession of the node.

You were responding to someone saying dont use cloud solutions, your response was what about a trusty vm.  You dont need to use those words because thats what the conversation was about.  Were all talking about gasoline engines and your bringing up diesel engine compression ratios.
