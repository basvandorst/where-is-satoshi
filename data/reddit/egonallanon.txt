if your going to get an ASIC from Bitmain I would recommend waiting till more details about the S3 emerge as an S2 is a bit on the pricey side of things for good ROI.

time for us europeans to reap the rewards then. We are well practiced at continental panic.

@_date: 2014-04-22 22:13:14
Well bitmain seem alright. No idea if they premine though.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:43:22
but that's about it. I'm not sure the doge community would want to hardfork again and I know litecoin refuses to hardfork.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:31:28
probably through a payment provider e.g. something like paypal.
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:22:31
yeah but they currently charge £335 for 1BTC where the price is closer to £295 at the moment.

COINS FOR THE COIN GOD!
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:47:51
they are currently sold out at bitmain and its looking like they are discontinuing them.

According to block origin they only hold 32%.

could always just hobby mine with something small that doesn't haul in  such a huge power bill.
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:06:18
could someone point me at where I could find the nearest P2Pool node to me for mining?
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:32:38
they have a nicer alternative.
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:37:10
Antminers are loud? I find mine is really quiet compared to my other mining hardware.
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:34:14
the S2 uses the same type of chip just undervolted. I would imagine Bitmain have now discontinued the S1 in order to focus on developing a 40NM of 28NM chip.
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:07:43
ok then I will buy all your bitcoins for $4.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:12:45
Sounds about right.
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:01:23
Never really felt that was too much of an issue myself. I find the initial sync was really quick on mine only took about 12 hours.
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:55:53
here's where you sit on the tax side of things. no idea about any of your other questions too. I suppose when offered bitcoin as payment for work to ensure to reputability of the person offering the work.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:46:17
I think the single thing Dogecoin really offers technology wise is that is inflationary as opposed to the hard cap of Bitcoin. But the Bitcoin is also effectively inflationary for the next 90 odd years or so which removes Dogecoin's real single unique point.

what is the issue with Bitcoin-qt exactly?
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:56:29
well I'll have a look at that link to see if I can find a pool that offers NMC mining. Devcoin is not a coin I have any real interest as I don't think it add much to the world technically so I'll give them a miss. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 08:25:02
you mine cooper out of the ground and sell the ore for a profit, that profit is then taxed. it works like the "realization event" term he uses up there.

Bitmain and ASICMiner seem to be pretty good so far. Weather this changes in the future or not is unknown.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:45:26
For the last time NO!
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:50:47
It would really change the way bitcoin worked. For one it would encourage massive hoarding than already exists.

does anyone know of a P2P node that allows merge mining Namecoin and is also near/in the UK as that is pretty much the only thing keeping larger centralized pools.
@_date: 2014-06-22 18:42:53
Might be Bitmain testing huge numbers of S3 miners.
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:15:16
BUY LOW! BUY HIGH! KEEP BUYING! JUST BUY!

ah fantastic news. got all the extra fans from my antminers from them.

Not a problem I expect humanity to run into in the immediate future.
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:27:52
looks really like an antminer which is good as it that is the best looking ASIC around and one of the major decisions of which ASIC I buy is how it looks.
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:44:42
SEPA payments are available in the UK.

@_date: 2014-06-11 01:24:22
S2 is 1.1W/GH so if that miner can achieve the quoted figures that's pretty good.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:16:03
there has been some talk about them merge mining but it is in the early stages and looks pretty unlikely at the moment.
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:53:51

To assume the law is a total blanket ban on such transfers is asinine. I would imagine the law accounts for things like use of PayPal( and other payment providers) and credit card transfers. The aspect I think the law blocks are wire transfers from personal to business accounts.

Bitmain does a pretty good job of it too.

Where have all these tipping threads turned up from recently, I'm used to them in but not here. Its a nice development but I am in the dark as to why/how it happened.

I would feel now is a good time to suggest using a password database such as keepass or lastpass to provide more secure passwords. Personally I would recommend keepass as it is offline and more secure.

I've never thought about that aspect of silk road till now but your probably quite right that the typical street dealer will suffer if the silk road continues to expand. Though street dealers will always have a place as people will always want to get drugs quick.

hard for a 4 month old currency to lose value for 6 months.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:14:40
it looking like it will really take off in Europe with it being listed as currency rather than property in several countries which may help speed things on the exchanges/ mining front.

Ah fair enough. I presumed he was running a site of questionable legality and he wold require an more long term anonymous service a la tor.
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:19:28
this is exactly the kind of service that someone like paypal provides.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:13:04
perhaps he was buying something with it rather than sending it to an exchange?
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:51:36
the guy who made cgminer i think runs a solo "pool" you can connect to it and if you find a block you keep all the reward yourself. saves on the hassle of setting up your own solo mine.
