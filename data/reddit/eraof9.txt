how easy it is to setup a way to get paid in lightning ? Do I have to run a node at the same time?
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:15:12
as someone who does not fully understand lightning network. Does been able to pay in lightning speed with no fees means that like Segwit it has to do with the creation of address. For example, Can I import my existing address into the wallet and make a lightning payment ?
also since we are at the early years, the future lighting users will have to have a full node etc or a simple wallet would suffice ?
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:21:40
how can i use lightning payment in mainnet. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:07:50
I ll volunteer in whipping the ass of whoever eats it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:57:42
well the real question is was he holding the sign or hodling the sign ?
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:33:30
my local starbucks accept bitcoin because of the guy who accepts your bitcoin and he pays in cash even if he is an employee since before the bitcoin hype. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:51:05
stick with bitcoin then. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:31:09
I dont get why we have to beg them to do that. I dont care if they do or do not. There are other exchanges that need our support.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:18:24
but isnt amds cards better for mining ?

there is nothing more centralized than church. Sorry but that is very bad analogy even if this is meant to be as a joke.
EDIT: you can Fork it though. You might get more believers.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:03:09
just use a wallet that supports what you believe in, like electrum (for me), and save your seed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:14:16
wait till it builds up volume

well, it used to be usable when the network wasnt as heavy. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:17:32
not again, the other's guy video was brutal enough. I cannot sleep since yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:32:33
Well, yea the fees right now are crap but I do believe in the developers on LN. There are some guys who i trust that obviously know more than me, and those trust the LN. you might call me a sheep and you might be true in some sense, but I trust them they will fix bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:58:25
i think dieing would be a blessing after this.

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:40:09
get futures. i dont know if you have heard all the buzz latelym but cme and cboe are offering futures, cme will do so soon. that might be a good way to balance your portofolio in case of a downturn.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:49:23
"hey man, want to send me some too?"but in a not so direct manner.

yea it was like me checking the website and accidentaly watching EUR instead of USD, and from 10000 it was much less. fuck that moment.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:36:49
so since fiat and bitcoin are similar. why bother? other than trading for profit ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:30:24
nope. do you list your csgo skins too?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:41:22
if there was such a risk as bitcoin going to zero CME wouldnt offer the futures. it will simply mean that there will be big ups and big downs from now on. 
In order for CME to offerfutures they have to put balance in  both situations or losing or winning, they are not stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:31:06
i think it is good that it dropped, too much adoption of bitcoin is only causing problems. we still do not have lightning!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:50:12
what do we mean by "short position"? you mean a small investment?

i am very sorry for your loss op. unfortunately, most of us here will a similar disappointment your brother felt because at some point we missed the oportunity. ofc it seems like your brother didnt miss it, they just stole it from him. 
but the truth is bitcoin to wealth was not so straight forward where many people their bitcoin on mtgox or people who simple sold too early.
i would have done the same , at the point where i felt my money would become 3 or 4 times i would have sold so fast that i woulnt even think about it.
even now, i made about 70% profit and thinking it wiill crash now. but i decided that money is not mine any more.

man if you could donate something to some MAJOR pet/animal rescues. it would be great.
I think that guy on youtube called "The Vet Ranch" is trustworthy.
 send him a message. 
I would love to say about a rescue in my country, Cyprus, but I am afraid it will go into the pocket of some assholes. there are far too many dogs and cats released here. it is shame.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:34:36
the thing is, even if they did increase the block size like in BCH, due to heavy network it would be a similar situation. RIght now BITCOIN is the big crypto, all the other alt coins are attacking bitcoin whether spamming transactions or whatever, I want to see how far BCH will go though.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:05:19

If you know about bitcoins but dont know about Andreas Antonopoulos, you are doing it wrong.

it is true that most people think they can only buy sold bitcoins. after i let them know they can buy 0.00001 bitcoins then they are more open to the idea.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:37
yea probably they are just trying to mess with reddit community and ask for his bitcoin address to send him coins for been a good guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:51:16
maybe when it is complete. and wy not pressure them and say if ln is stable and published by x date, you get it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:57:37
In an open source community, such as in bitcoin, there cannot be trademarks, so projects that are similar or forked can use the same name if they want to. and so that is what happenend. BTC subreddit is used by Bitcoin Cash supporters as if they havent confused too many people already. 
i dont know if you are familiar with linux but thousands if not millions of linux distribution exists. each one is a fork and goes with their own idea. For outsiders, it might seem odd or wrong that so many people work on so many different projects instead of just one. But that is the beauty of open source, each one can do it as they please. 
now what many people are angry with bitcoin cash community is that they try to confuse people into thinking that bitcoin that BOOMED is bitcoin cash and they do that using the website of bitcoin dot com instead of the dot org. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:47
yea , we definitely need a strong correction, go stip clip upwords was too dangerous.

LN is another layer on the blockchain like TCP/IP is to the internet. 
LN would have to be implemented by the mainnet (nodes etc).
If I wanted to create a layer above blockchain but for different reason, like exchanging files. Would that be possible as a layer on blockchain ? I have no idea what I am talking about, I want to understand the concept.

did you show him how easy it is to create a wallet ?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:28:03
hmm that`s not completely true. My grandfather lived a war in my country, gold will always have value, you might not find the amount that it is worth exactly but someone who has extra something whether that is food or fuel , will sell it for gold because no matter what, it will always has value. that is why I do not like when people compare bitcoin to gold. You can not simply ignore the history of gold for so many years, bitcoin might be a thing that will stay but nobody is sure. for gold, i could invest every penny I have and I know for sure that I will still have the value that I spend but I wont be making much profit. 
oh yea, since then my grandfather is still investing into gold and he has a ton of toilet paper.

i dont think anyone ever would not save money because currency is weakening, unless you are in Venezuela. the people who do want to do that however often buy gold but not because of inflation but because of stability that even in war they can carry or be useful.

if anything, after bigger adoption of bitcoin, people can start acting on energy consumption concern but right now bitcoin is too small to be bothered by it. the banking system as it is today is not eco-friendly by any means. but if anything geeks running this network will go full eco if they have to. but that is too early and I dont think the concern there is from different sources is valid, at least not at this point.

A month ago, I asked in this forum a question "Who should I blame if Bitcoin was ruined for any reason?" Most people were joking and attacking me. The reason I asked that question is because I know how risky it was/is. 
The idea of a digital currency is great and it will be the future. But digital security industry and laws are not yet to that level. For that, I was out.

I dont think the new people want to mine. mining was used in the past to make some money, I dont see any reason why an everyday bitcoin users would want to mine other than for education. I dont say there should be no information whatsoever but i dont think it is important. also the first thing that comes out with a google/youtube search of bitcoin is mining.

yes but computer 2 could transfer 0.15 btc to computer 1 so ther eis only 1 transaction in the first place.
In other words, I understand your example, you mean that lightning would be advantageous if I was going to the same supermarket every day buying staff and at the end of the X days , only 1 transaction will take place.
But why is it an advtage if I want to pay X, and from I &gt; C &gt; D&gt; a&gt; X. even if again all this transactions are been made outside the network. but how will it make this faster. AND Now as I type this, I finally understand what I wanted to understand :) thank you.

what is this estimated change? and why i have two outputs. did I miss add another address? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:53:35
okay now it start making sense, yes. You are right. My wallet has also change addresses that I didnt know about. Yes it went into my change address.
now I have a new question though, When I exported the private keys on my wallet. It only happened for the addresses that were receiving and not the change address. why is that? is there a painless way to move the change back to my main wallet ? and that generates another question on whether it is possible to spend bitcoins from a specific address, since I dont have a choice to select address.

yes that was me 1week ago
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:23:37
ok, I have the private key of the public address that was the change address. When I tried to sweep, it was asking for a public address and I gave one that I have in my wallet. then in order to do the transaction I had to broadcast and the amount of money that went to my other account was 0.0029 instead of 0.0031. 
what could have i dont otherwise not to pay the fee in order to move the money from the change address to an address that is on my main wallet ?

This post is a proof how transparent bitcoin is and how anti-money laundry it is.

man, now you confused me more ;p
you said the change is send back to me (my wallet) ? but i do not have that public address (1JZsotQQojgwC78ZHrn77oSWLVyW3tSbG2). 
also i dont have the receiving address of 0.002 in my wallet, so i am not confused to add more in it in the future, since he now have the private key of it.  I created that private key using an offline generator script.
edit: also could you elaborate LI5 the part were I spend an input larger than the amount i sent ? the truth is I started with 0.006, I knew the few were high at the time (it was during the attack but it was his birthday).

yes i mean, since he doesnt have a wallet, or anything, i created a paper wallet just to have the private key and public address to send, which later i posted him the private key.

I wonder if this person will ever get the gratitude he deserves in real life. For obvious reasons he should not reveal his identity but very few people would ever do as such in a world we live in if they were given such opportunity.

For people who suggest it was a murder. That is a high posibility, we are not talking for a few hundred pounds. We are talking about serious money.

Yea but you cannot really see things like that. Big companies have too big deficits too because that`s how economy works. If I lend you money for 1 year and at the end of the year I add a small percent. Would you pay back my money as fast as possible or make the most of it until the year is coming to an end ?
