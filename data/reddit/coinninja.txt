Each group also has a KNC Neptune on the way as well, so yes we will be scaling up.  90 Antminers, 3 KNC Neptunes, power supplies, datacenter setup fees, cables and more... it all adds up fast ~ in the neighborhood of 100BTC invested so far. So far none of the new 28nm asics have been particularly earth shattering, given the power efficiency and immediate availability of Antminers.

If you are using Tor with a credit card on a site used to buy bitcoin you are indeed shady as fuck. There's no room for Tor and credit cards and this should be blocked by the provider.  They should take action to immediately block all known TOR exit nodes as a fraud prevention measure.

Bitcoin needs more businesses like Coinbase..They make it easy for people to use bitcoin, and frankly bitcoin can be tedious and difficult to use.  We love their merchant services (which is where this exploit was focused). I have to agree though, people should take personal responsibility and store their coins safely in their own wallet, that they control, and not in an online hosted service. Coinbase does offer some level of blockchain transparency (they aren't a fractional reserve scam), but still they hold the private keys, so you are giving up control.

Either the price will move up enough for mining to remain profitable when the reward halves, or miners will shut off their machines in droves.  I'm not particularly worried about the time between blocks or the next difficulty adjustment after that, these are fairly trivial problems to solve and have been solved by alt-currencies (where most of the innovation is happening).

Profit is a motivator, but more in that we are trying to maximize the profits of the hardware owners (myself included), rather than make profits on management and fractional sales. My real motivation is to protect the community from shady operators that prey on the uninformed with overpriced mining contracts, or guaranteed-loss preorders. Together we can build a honest, ethical mine to benefit the whole community.

We paid about the same price as everyone else; Bitmain doesn't really give much of a volume discount.  The miners were ordered over a period of a few weeks, so they were anywhere from 3.1 - 1.9btc each.  We got a bunch of coupons for Group  so the savings were passed onto Group  and  owners. We've standardized on Corsair AX1200 power supplies; they run 3 Antminers very well at 375Mhz (they perform better than their ratings when fed 208V power).

Funny I know RFC's quite well.  It's a request for comment, which is how the Internet establishes all of its requirements and improvements.  BIP is very similar, as they are improvements to bitcoin, designed allow interoperability between software that follows the spec outlined in the BIP.  In both cases vendors are free to play outside of the standards game, such as how Cisco has done with routing.   
NAT routing has slowed the adoption of IPv6.  IP addresses DO cost money, buying a /24 isn't exactly cheap - plus you have to justify your need.

I would have reported it without a bounty.  It's not about the reward; it's just a matter of doing the right thing.

You have some factual inaccuracies.  SHA-256 is a far more simple algorithm than Scrypt.  It takes more SHA-256 hashes to do anything simply because of the difficulty on Bitcoin being so high.  Given the same piece of general purpose computing hardware (CPU/GPU) you will get far more SHA-256 hashes per second than Scrypt.

It really didn't matter which company's miner you picked, you pretty much end up losing (in the short run) with mining.

I believe LIFO is the most accurate method of representing the value of your Bitcoin inventory, particularly if you are running a mining operation. 
For an investor/speculator FIFO is probably more appropriate.

Clover POS makes it easy to accept bitcoin via Gyft, but that's not really bitcoin, plus they nail the merchant with a $30/mo fee.

There's been reports of wallets on BlockChain.info being hacked. I wouldn't store anything more than spending cash there.  Look into Armory, thats the current "standard" for secure storage (offline old laptop).  Or use a paper wallet and put it somewhere fireproof and physically secure.
Encrypting your wallet really doesn't do anything more than give you a false sense of security.  If someone has control of your machine, they WILL get your passphrase.
Basically theres a tradeoff right now between security and convenience.  Windows users face the greatest amount of threats.  Disable Java plugins. Switch to Linux or MacOS for your desktop.  
The Android wallet is also another good option.  If you use it, then you REALLY have to be careful about any other apps you install.

Speaking as someone that has multiple e-commerce websites and has experimented with bitcoin payments, I can attest that its easy to start accepting bitcoin payments.  The problem is that NOBODY outside the bitcoin community has any desire to pay in bitcoin.  So unless your product is something that appeals strongly to the bitcoin community (bitcoin miners, bitcoin trinkets, and drugs), you aren't likely to get many sales.  It's not enough to convince merchants to accept bitcoin, you have to actually spend coins with them to make a difference.

Disclaimer: I have a decent sized order with BFL.
It sucks that their chip came out using more power and they have to redesign their boards, cooling, and power.  There are risks developing brand-new unproven hardware designs, and these things take time.  I do believe they are getting there but I am not happy that its taking so long. However, I am an engineer and have seen this happen at nearly every company in every market. The only difference here is that BFL has our money up front.
My understanding is that anyone that has asked for a refund has gotten their money back.
The other ASIC vendors are profiteering heavily artificially limiting supply until BFL ships.

If they don't deliver in 30 days of the order, the purchaser is legally entitled to a refund if he doesn't want to wait.  BFL can have whatever policy they want, but they can't violate FTC laws.  Being thats its only been 2 weeks, and their policy is no refunds - the buyer just needs to wait a couple of weeks and then exert consumer protection rights.

The $40 Raspberry Pi also makes an excellent cold storage device. Because the storage is fully removable, you can also use it for other purposes rather than only dedicating it to Cold Storage.

Lower overall cost (no sd card needed), lower power, less heat (GPU on Pi makes it run hot).  MineNinja is a turn-key mining solution based on the BeagleBone Black. We are getting close to having a product ready.

That's a big amount of cash, well over the reportable threshold and more than you are allowed to even transport. Doing this "off the record" in the US is probably a felony.  Surely you can find some shady people on  on freenet irc that will take the deal.

Try going to locally-owned independent places where you can talk to the owners in person. Nobody wants unsolicited email.

Nothing prevents the service operator from locking your rate for a given time period in exchange for a fee.  The exchange rate on Mt. Gox doesn't have to control the usage of bitcoin for money transfers.

Paywalls suck.  This is a business model that needs to die, period. Copying craptastic stuff that is already done with fiat currencies isn't the innovation we are looking for.

Don't worry, the bitcoin super club are hard at work at implementing a new certificate based payment system that gives our governments exactly the visibility they are looking for. Hopefully it will suck and nobody will use it ;)

I guess the main reason I am using the BeagleBone is that I met the folks that develop it out at Design West this year.  The price difference between the two is less than $10, and you have to add an SD card and cable to use the Pi. The Bone is faster, more stable, and has IO that is more Arduino like.

Anyone know what android device was used by the victim?  It's far more likely that its a problem with a missing/bad hardware random number generator, than a flaw in the Java crypto library itself.

We plan to grow by world of mouth and expanding our product offerings. Make cool stuff that people want and everything else falls into place.  We've had one international order so far. It's much easier to send a bitcoin payment overseas than shipping a package overseas. Normally we get around 100 unique visitors per day, and the conversion rate is really low, less than 1%.  Openness, Honesty, and Transparency are how we build customer trust.  And if I started accepting PayPal my sales would easily double, limiting payment choices hurts business and consumers like the protections they get from credit cards. But that would ruin the experiment IMHO; in this case I am my own payment processor and won't be suffering from chargebacks and return scams.
