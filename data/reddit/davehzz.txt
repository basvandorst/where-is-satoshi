Maybe at the moment for some, me being one of them. I'm very excited about its deflatory nature and what that could mean as a store of value. The currency of my country is not the Venezuelan bolivar but it does lose value faster than the dollar every year.
That said, i'm in for the long haul, I plan to cash out a part of it at some point and see what the future holds for the rest.
EDIT: I forgot to finish a point I started. I said "at the moment" at the beginning, because that future could see BTC's usefulness as currency increase over time. And i do think conservative steps towards that goal is the way to go, "it's not a race, it's a marathon" I think would apply here.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:55:53
Just make sure it's something that can work offline and doesn't save for when you go back online. If your seed gets online it defeats the purpose.
If you have a Trezor they are planning to release a solution that will allow you to test your seed with their recovery interface (which scrambles options of the device so you can't be keylogged) but so far the solution can only be accessed via command line interface which isn't very user friendly.

I think loosing momentum and slowing down a bit for a year would be good. That way we don't risk a crash from getting mass adoption before we're is ready for it. Slowing down would give time for the LN to be ready in time for true mass adoption without rushing, rushing the LN would be the real tragedy.

@_date: 2017-12-14 07:40:17
you would if you only have one device. But I think I speak for a majority here by suggesting you buy another device and restore there, that way if your seed fails to recover your BTC you already have another device to create a new seed, test it and then transfer your BTC from the old wallet to the new, tested one.
EDIT: I did this (buying another device) because I neither tested nor enabled passphrase protection on my first wallet (Even though you can enable passphrase at any point, creating hidden wallets wouldn't have been very effective since the transaction history shows what your whole balance was at one point, in turn, showing anyone who might, in person, coerce you to transfer them your BTC, that you might have hidden wallets)

Yeah, catching the very valley of a dip is always hard. I always buy too early because of impatience. You almost hit it spot on though, $50 is nothing with the swings we're having right now.

yeah, i'm starting to get that impression. I bought some more already just in case. I still wanna see if I can get a lower price through tomorrow. Worse case scenario I don't buy optimally but the price recovery will make that irrelevant in a week.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:18:00
Oh. I might have misunderstood what the other guy was saying then. I thought by "pre-fork" coins he meant coins that you could still split by other means after you take them out of the Coinbase.
But you're right. If i'm understanding you correctly, pre fork coins are just the main chain coins collectively called that in the context of a fork (forked coins being the fork chain coins), and I've read the term used like that before I just gave it a different meaning because of the context of what the other guy was saying. I'll reassess the other conversation.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:04:40
I can only speak for Trezor, but as long as you display a receive address on the device' screen itself to verify that it hasn't changed before finalizing a transaction you should be good right? At least when receiving.
EDIT: When sending though if it is to a web-based service you can only verify you are indeed sending to the address the receiver is giving, and if it's that web page that is tricking you, what client you are using (web based or not) becomes irrelevant.

Does this mean that they'll (suposedly) have B2X support right away?
Wouldn't that be the fastest way to dump the forked coins? (Assuming they're not just BSing and hold the forked coins indefinitely)
Me and my Trezor are gonna have to wait for the Trezor guide on how to split them. I hope it's still worth something by then.

Got it, I hadn't considered exchange-specific limitations. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:19:50
I had a tx confirm a moment ago. It took about an hour and a half. The fee was 0.0005 BTC about 3 dollars.
That's always what any tx has costed between Volabit (Mexican exchange) and my wallet though. So I don't know what the deal is there, either they are using a high-ish fee and offsetting the cost with their exchange rate or the txs are this fast now. I say this fast because I expected it to be way slower due to the situation and low fee (relative to the numbers that are being thrown around lately)
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:21:30
If you don't hold your private keys (which you don't if you have your coins in an exchange) you are at the mercy of the entity who does.
As an example, the people who had BTC on Coinbase at the time of the BCash fork, which happened in August, will receive that BCash on January 1st 2018.

I think if the coin has replay protection (like BCH for example) you can only get them from the place you had the coins at the time of the fork.
I'm legitimately not sure though, hope somebody else weighs in.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:11:14
Haha. I should've mentioned I was talking about the post Segwit2x suspension state of affairs in the title. But fair enough.
I haven't missed the boat entirely btw, I already own some bitcoin.

Could also be that maybe there are sell orders set to 8k. It's fine though once those are out of the way we'll make it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:16:46
I just sent one from an exchange to my wallet. There wasn't an option to increase the fee or anything, so i expect it to be the lowest. That'd be the worst case scenario.
Doing the math, there are around 141k unconfirmed transactions right now. I've seen the txs per second going from 12 to 40 let's say an average of 25. If all transactions had the same priority that would be 1.5666 (repeating) hours. That is of course depending on if a block is picked up based on first come first serve or random, I don't know how that works, in any case, it would still be like an average time your tx should spend in the mempool.
All that said, though, higher priority txs do get picked up first so it's also a matter of what percentage of the already submitted txs are high priority and how many new high priority txs come in every second. So, that's where math stops being useful unless there is a way to check that kind of information.
Source: 
EDIT: I'm thinking txs per second might be the rate at which new transactions are coming in, not txs being confirmed. But the number of unconfirmed txs is slowly decreasing so the rate at which they are confirmed must be higher.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:35:39
I get that, I was replying to pre previous guy who said OP can just move their coins to a wallet (presumably) to split them there.
OP would just move their BTC but would not be able to get the BCH that way because BCH has replay protection, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:51:22
So it goes to a newly created wallet (from the perspective of the bockchain) of which nobody holds the private keys?
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:40:21
Here's hoping. I do think it'll recover quite fast so I only have a couple of days to wait. At this point if it falls anywhere below 7k. I'll probably pull the trigger on the whole amount i'm planning to buy.

You're welcome. This is the advice I see most. I know I've bought on the way down and wished I paced myself more after running out of the amount I planned to buy way before reaching the very valley of the dip. But it could go either way.
Whomever tells you they know at what what number it's gonna stop and reverse they are either very knowledgeable or think they know but not really and there's no way to tell which is which. I myself are relatively new, I started in September, that's why i'm just relaying what i consider to be good advice.

I subscribed to him when he was recurringly featured on Charlie McDonnell's channel "charlieissocoollike" He stopped being featured on the channel after a while and there was a whole thing about them having a falling out over allegations made against Day (Alex Day, the guy in this video) of some kind. At some point I unsubscribed, I don't remember if Charlie or Alex made a video on the subject and that's how I knew, i must've unsubscribed then. It's been a while.
EDIT: I just checked Wikipedia, they were "Sexual manipulation allegations". No wonder he has subscribers but no viewers, it says on there he had a 7 month hiatus after the allegations so the subs are probably old inactive accounts which just never unsubscribed.

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question and my apologies to OP regardless for going off topic.
What is the advantage of buying from someone else rather than an exchange? Is it the exchange rate? It's the only thing that comes to mind.

.13324 x (100,000 - 7398) but yeah, the math is still very simple.
Btw, OP. That would be $12,338.29
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:17:34
Thanks for the info. I use Volabit (Mexican exchange) and the only ways to get the money to them is a deposit to one of their accounts or a bank transfer to the same, it takes a maximum of 3 hours for them to credit your account (they usually take a fraction of that time), what they have instead are an amount limits for depositing/buying/selling that you can increase by forgoing privacy. And fees for depositing/transferring are negligible, fees for buying/selling are proportional.
I had heard of Coinbase's wait times but did not know how the fees related to that.
EDIT: I added some info.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:34:08
When you bring up the attack failure at r/btc they reply with the argument that the pump and dump made ver &amp; co a lot of money so subsequent attacks can be more powerful each time.
I say that's bullshit since people will catch up to that and BCH can suffer too from such instability. But my point is that r/btc can't pretend they are the good guys anymore if they knowingly support such behavior.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:24:20

Didn't your brother mention how much it was going up along the way? That could've jolted your memory.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:29:24
whoa, so Volabit must definitely be pricing the fees into their exchange rate to keep the fee flat and paying high-ish fees for the txs out. Clever, since an increase to the exchange rate is a bit harder to pin down (specially because it's in Pesos) and that way new Mexican adopters don't freak out due to high fees or excessive times when dipping their toes into bitcoin. Good for them.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:42:03

Thanks for replying. That's how i see it.
Someone else answered that CB can send out pre-fork coins when someone withdraws though. That somewhat made sense to me because I thought coins were uniquely identifiable as a string of code but i just checked (upon your reply) and read that they are not, that they are only stored as balances on addresses.
So, can CB send such pre-forked coins?
Sorry to continue to ask questions, I'll get around to reading all of this on my own sooner rather than later, books and stuff, but in the meantime it's hard to find answers to such specific questions.

Backlash is a part of it, I won't deny it. But it's also a confidence thing, something I picked up a long time ago when I was wrong a bigger percentage of the time compared to now (as most of us are as teenagers), after I started saying things like "I think" and "IMO" on things I wasn't 100% sure of, I could point to those if I got refuted (being refuted is another kind of backlash, but it's valid backlash). It's a crutch really, but habits die hard.

That's what i'm saying.

@_date: 2017-11-16 01:40:37
If BCH were to go mainstream tomorrow instead of BTC, their low fees and fast transactions wouldn't stay that way for long. Even if the flippening happens (which i don't think will), when BTC's real solutions to the scaling problem are deployed, people will take notice and come back/get in.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:13:53

i do that a few times a week thinking about this year though since i didn't know about bitcoin 4 years ago. If i had entered when i found out about it it would entered around the 1k usd mark. I entered recently on the septermber dip around the 4k mark so that's 4 times the stake in BTC.

In any case, I was just saying I got that reference. And there is a quote in "The Avengers" by Captain America that says just that, it's actually kind of a meme now.
Sound's a bit low but that's the scene.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:13:40
You can buy over a couple of days to lessen risk, say 1/3 tonight, 1/3 tomorrow, 1/3 saturday. If it goes up it won't be as bad as if you waited. If it goes down it won't be as bad as if you bought it all tonight.
EDIT: someone below brought up Coinbase fees. I'm not familiar enough with Coinbase (I use an exchange from my country). I don't know if their fees are flat or proportional (or a mix of both). So if you plan to go for this approach and splitting the amounts to buy will result in higher overall fees do some math to check if such increase is worth it for the amount you plan to buy.
EDIT from u/ins0ma_ who replied to me below.






@_date: 2017-11-24 04:56:54
That's true, but minimizing risk comes at that cost. It'd be a matter of seeing if this approach makes sense for the amount OP wants to buy given the fees.

@_date: 2017-11-13 05:40:09
The Mexican exchange I use works similarly, I can deposit or wire transfer and buy the same day. They also have a flat $3 rate but for txs out to a public address (that one is a god send right now with the high fees everyone's talking about). The fee to entry is their exchange rates which can get kind of high (i suspect they price in the transaction fee to keep it flat)
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:35:43
I use Volabit to exchange, I also fund my account with SPEI and it's instant, the fee to buy BTC is a flat $11 pesos plus whatever the exchange rate is, which is usually a little bit higher than the actual price of bitcoin. The fee to transact out is a flat rate of 0.0005 BTC which right now is about $60 pesos though.
All of that said, I do not use Volabit as my wallet, since Volabit is not really a wallet. I use a Trezor for that.

1a) A software wallet is more convenient but it's prone to whatever hacks and malware the device you are using is prone to.
1b) A hard wallet is less convenient since you need a physical device to sign outgoing transactions, said device has a physical architecture less prone to attacks as it is a dedicated device only able to perform the functions it is designed to carry out. NOTE: It is useful to think of your wallet as a separate thing from the physical device which is only needed to sign your outgoing transactions, it does not "hold" your funds per se.
2) You need the physical device to sign outgoing transactions because it is the only thing that knows your private keys, whatever device you connect it to (computer, phone) does not learn your private keys, it only receives verification from the device. That's why it's safer, because your Private keys are never exposed to malware or other harmful code that could learn them and send them to a malicious party through the Internet. And that is the point of the hard wallet in a nutshell.
3) Your private keys can also be derived from your seed, which is why you must keep your seed hidden. Your seed can be redeemed in another wallet service to gain access to your funds, which is both how you access your funds if your wallet's physical device is destroyed/lost and how your funds get stolen it's somebody else using your seed to gain access to the funds in another wallet service.
TL,DR: You are correct that the only thing you need to gain access to your funds is your seed, but a hard wallet (the physical device itself) is a layer of protection that you use to "sign" your outgoing transactions so that nobody can spend your funds if they don't have access to that device, assuming that your seed is well hidden, of course.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:59:50
Well, you can see on that graphic that the blocks are chipping away at that orange stripe, your transaction is two stripes below in the blue one. So, i'd say it will be 1 to 2 days tops given the blocks were finishing eating away two stripes above 24 hrs ago.
I'm not sure what would happen with a new tx, if you have the funds for the second I think that tx would transfer new funds, but i'm not sure. I hope you get an answer from someone who knows for sure.
EDIT: Hey that was even faster than I predicted, the blocks ate through the blue stripe like crazy.

@_date: 2017-11-13 11:24:46
I second this explanation.
As I understand it, without a layer 2 solution to the scaling problem, BCH would have to hard fork every so often to have bigger blocks as transaction numbers grow and each time mining pools would have to upgrade hardware to hold the entire blockchain, which only large mining pools would be able to do, which in turn centralizes the mining.
This is a big picture kind of issue, and bitcoin is tackling it with solutions that wouldn't require hard forks every so often. Those solutions take time though.
This is my limited understanding of it, corrections are welcome.

I don't know how much time yours took but I made a tx earlier this evening as well. It was in the opposite direction though, Exchange to Trezor.
Mine took an hour and a half and I thought that was pretty fast compared to the wait times people had been throwing around lately.
But the math checks out. there were around 141k unconfirmed transactions at the time. the txs per second were going from 12 to 40 let's say an average of 25. These are new txs being added, of course, the txs being confirmed are more since the pool is shrinking but let's take that number. That would be 1.56 hours. and that's how long my tx took to confirm (give or take).
It can be faster depending on how many high priority txs there are, maybe in your case there were very little and also because i used the txs/s on the uncorfirmed transactions page and the transactions being confirmed is faster than that.
Sorry if my formatting is messy or any typos there may be, i'm about to go to bed.

Be careful with credit or loans of course. Odds aren't against you with bitcoin, just be safe.
BTW: i meant sub 7k not 6k, sorry about that.

Well what can cement your place at the top? to prevent other people from getting there.
Maybe he's trying to bring down all of crypto as a whole so the redistribution of wealth that would make all early adopters rich doesn't happen, because if it does happen he won't be as "special" as he is now.
He was the first to climb the ladder, it's time to push the ladder down.

I sold half of mine as soon as I got it from Trezor and have a  sell order for the other half at the price I would like to sell it (being realistic, of course). We'll see if it hits that during this rocky surge it's having.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:51:04
Yeah, there is a lot of redundant info in the original post, not all of it is needed. My approach has its flaws though since it doesn't account for exchange rates and what not, in that way your approach is more practical. He will probably get 13k from the exchange when he sells rather than the full $13,324 and he probably did buy 1k instead of what it's worth right now.
EDIT: I realized you might be right in a practical sense, so i added that at the end.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:13:02

I was about to write a whole thing about my skepticism of these pre-fork coins. But then I remembered that coins are a unique string of code and now it makes more sense to me. I have a lot yet to read.
EDIT: I just read coins aren't strings of code they are stored simply as balances on addresses, now i'm skeptical of those "pre-fork" coins again. Also I might be misunderstanding what you mean by pre-fork coins, would you elaborate on that first?
EDIT 2: God, my reply is a mess. If i'm being a complete doofus for misunderstanding this whole thread it's gonna feel bad but I shall keep the comments intact, that is, not erase my confusion. That's why i'm adding so many edits. I think now I understand what you were saying all along and I agree (if i'm understanding you correctly).
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:32:51
Thank you for that. I've been reading on the scaling debate but not enough to feel comfortable not making that disclaimer.

For anyone wondering, it's for some ICO. Won't say which, I don't want to give them the promotion.
I clicked just to check and see if it was BCH that would've made it funnier and I would've based the title around it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:42:44
First of all, thanks for the reply.
I should've specified but I'm Mexican so i'm using an exchange called Volabit, not Coinbase.
I could make a Coinbase account and transfer them there if it's safer. But is Coinbase safer than say a Mobile Wallet on iPhone? (which i'm sure is safer than a Desktop wallet in my everyday use computer)
And how much Bitcoin is too much to not be on cold storage? I really want to start strong now before the price rises. Say, is half a Bitcoin too much to have in a non hardware wallet? Is one whole one too much? etc.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:47:23
This is awesome!
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:16:12
Thank you, that answers my questions. It's a relief to read the addresses cannot be changed.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:37:44
Thank you. It is gonna be (way) over 1000 usd. I just purchased a Trezor wallet though. It'll be arriving at some point next week so the Bitcoin will spend less than a week on the exchange, hopefully.
And it is the most reputable exchange for Mexico so I'd have to be pretty unlucky for the exchange to be hacked over the next week.
Your comments, and specifically the last part of your latest does make me feel more at ease, it does strike me as more secure to keep them in the exchange and hope the exchange doesn't get hacked (unlikely in the short term) than to rely on my own capabilities to properly secure any kind of wallet in a device connected to the internet even for a short time.
Thanks again.

It's for you to decide, but a good tip is that it should be an amount you are willing to loose if things go south. It'll help you remain calm when there are small temporary dips which can be nerve-racking at first. (btw, also fairly new here, so take with a grain of salt)
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:05:02
An ATH is always higher than the last by definition. But i get you. I also think we aren't there yet, but I do think it'll be a while before the next super crazy rally like last year's
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:49:05
Does it work if you make two accounts on a single Trezor? The Trezor companion wallet allows you to make "accounts" to use under a single interface, but i don't think it makes private keys for each, given it's still a single wallet recoverable under one recovery seed.
Although I would assume they would each have their own addresses even if generated from the same private keys. I'm too afraid to just try and answer my own question because i don't want to make a mistake.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:14:05
Came here to see this. was not disappointed.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:15:03
well thanks. I watch waaay too much science fiction.
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:18:02
Hey, i live in Mexico. Did not know this.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:00:52
Oh my god, yes! I thought it would be a different transaction, or... i don't know what it thought.
Okay so i have all i need to do this. Awesome! Thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:31:32
Thank you. This is great!
I'm realizing though that I could not do this between two Trezor chrome wallet accounts since there is no way to send one of those multiple address transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:46:16
I agree.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:18:40
Thank you. So if you send the coin you want to send to another address that only accepts that coin the transaction can't be replayed right? Is that what people mean when they talk about splitting the coins?
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:32:15
How do you do that? I'm not only seeing hieroglyphics on the code. I also don't understand how you add an additional address to a transaction (Additional to the address you're sending the BTC to). Or do you protect all of your transactions from a point on when you make a single payment to that address?
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:00:46
Thanks for answering. I'm new so I haven't used many services. Only Volabit (Mexican exchange) and Trezor's companion wallet (on the Trezor website). I haven't seen what you describe in either.
So to do this I would have to start using one of these wallets with my Trezor, preferably pre-fork?
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:28:15
To corrupt a Hardware wallet ~~hey~~ they would need to have physical access ~~on~~ to the device AFAIK. That's why the best way to get them is directly from the manufacturer and if the packaging arrives intact, it's good.
Amazon and other retailers, although authorized vendors, mean more hands on the device at one point or another.
EDIT: typos.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:09:58
how do you split your coins? Sorry if this is a stupid question. I'm new.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:31:06
Also curious, why the text editor?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:34:24


What if Physical Security = Physical Security for the (very physical) servers for **online storage**.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:12:11
Oh, did not take it that way.
It does let you add another address, comment and amount. with a single fee field and one send button. So i assume they would be the same transaction allowing the thing to work. I hope XD.

If you take the red pill you'll have the opportunity to be immortal anyway with or without the medical developments. You just have to make sure the conditions are met so that you can take the red pill once again, rinse and repeat until you get tired of life and give old age a chance.

Thanks. I'll give it a read.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:21:04
Just saying it isn't "laid out clearly on the website".
Or at least not for the reason you gave.

Whoa. I haven't. I'll check it out. Thanks.

Hey I just asked a question about Replay protection as well. Here's my up vote hoping you get an answer. It'll be enough for me to get the answer to yours if mine doesn't get one.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:39:59
Thanks for the support.
When I worry, I think about this post  and I feel better, it reassures me that this kind of thing happens and is no cause for concern. It's one of the first things I saw when I came to this sub.
So i'm good, I worry but not too much.

Is the companion wallet to Trezor (the one in the Trezor website) an SPV wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:12:09
I discovered BTC recently. I was a bit late on the big dip. I started buying at $3900 and through $4300 and that was at a slightly higher rate because of the exchange.
I just finished buying what I felt satisfied with a few days ago and then it has been steadily dropping. So selling is not an option for me lest I loose money on the exchange.
It is worrisome but i'm only buying what i'm willing to loose.
So it's hodling for me and if it goes low enough i'll buy more. All that talk about bubbles could be right but if this isn't a bubble, I can't fathom this being the end of the line, we have a long ways to go.
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:47:25
What is this website/app?
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:57:26
So when you setup a new account through that interface, do you create a new recovery seed for this other wallet/account, or is it a new set of private keys from the same seed? and isn't the latter unsafe?
Sorry for so many questions
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:30:31
I don't know if i wanna risk splitting the coins, what will you guys do? whether you have a Trezor or not.
