I sold 1.9 bitcoin by PayPal and I still have not received my payment. I have sent over several tickets but got no response and I am hoping to have the money. I even sold smaller amuonts and they transferred just fine into my paypal account, but the 1.9 BTC or about 2200 USD did not transfer and I never had this happen before. If anyone can help me on this that may work for coinbase please let me know. I really love your exchange and would just like some support with this issue. Im still waiting on a response since 3/17 so this is getting frustrating
