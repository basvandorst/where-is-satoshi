You could consider allocating a portion of the fund to creating incentive-packages for scientific breakthroughs. Instead of donating the funds to use directly (working capital) you create prize rewards for solving a specific problem. Much like e.g. the 1 million USD Millennium Prize Problems, but then to problems that are more directly beneficial for humanity (thinks like: photovoltaic cells for solar power with a specific yield for less than a specific cost, method for detecting cancer with specific accuracy and cost, desalination of water below specific costs, etc.).
Set a specific amount of bitcoin aside for each solved problem such that maybe in 10 years there is an enormous financial incentive to solve it. Like that you can spread the impact of your fund over many more years.
Problem definition in coorperation with reputable scientific journals (Nature, Cell, etc) and their readers. Safekeeping and verification of problem solving by several of the top reputable law-firms and funds in multisig wallet.

It was a regular cellphone camera. Often they also have some sensitivity in the IR domain, however, everything is stored in RGB pixels and does not have any other spectral information. I made sure it didn't show, I copied the RGB-array (i.e. picture) to a new image file to remove any meta-data (just because...), and scaled it down to low-resolution.
Probably directly when engraving you might see a faint IR/heat signature if you can measure it. After seconds, at least after the time I engraved and made the picture, all that heat is dissipated.

Locally, house fires can reach higher temperatures though. Temperatures slightly higher than melting point of Copper have been reported (brass has lower melting point). Even though it is unlikely you coppercard will melt in a house fire, I chose a safe margin with stainless steel.
Copper is much softer and can be stamped indeed. Stainless steel needs some sort of power tool for engraving (or just hours of work). Inside your house, just exposed to air, copper won't corrode that rapidly, however, putting it underground for some years can corrode the stamping beyond repair (engraving copper will result in a quicker loss of your information when exposed to corrosion).

Ah I understand better. Yes, that should definitely be visible in IR. If the temperature in the steel is evenly distributed, you will see the etched parts as warmer as there is more heat emanating per square millimetre.

(in that case you wouldn't broadcast the spam-transactions to the network before mining the block so you don't have to worry about that)
Transactions fee's are now &gt;4BTC per block (yes, on average 8-9USD per transaction) and total block reward is 54k USD (coinbase) + 17k USD (fee). Cost of mining blocks is not likely to go down a lot (same order of magnitude), so block reward will be around 70k USD or higher. You think a stable incentive situation would be if miners will pay up to 20 USD transaction fee per transaction?
I hope this is a good incentive to start using a fully developed LN asap (?)

[Paper wallets]( [suck](
This is a 120x30x3 mm piece of stainless steel engraved with a bitcoin address on the one side, and the mnemonic private seed on the other side. It doesn't melt in house fires, it doesn't corrode underground, and it is terribly hard to break accidentally. Material costs: 1.80 EUR. One-time tool costs if you can't borrow: 50 EUR (30 EUR engraving device, 20 EUR diamond engraving tip). Drill a hole in it and you can screw it (private seed facing down) against a wall, in the foundation of your house or in a log half burried in the garden.
I just gave two like these as wedding gifts to my friends with an amount of bitcoin equal to what I would otherwise give in fiat money.

So they want to use 10M USD for building a new 16nm ASIC for 22.6 THz devices of which 18 THz is used for mining for buyer, and 4.8 THz for the mining pool.
They currently have a 160nm ASIC and the next step is a 28nm ASIC.
Furthermore they have already a mining farm equipped with the 160nm ASICs and are setting up a new farm (using the 90M USD?).

Even though it is fairly cold in [outer space]( cooling definitely is a problem as there is no air to dissipate the heat.
The ASIC's should be designed such that it is tolerant against radiation damage, only reducing the hashrate slightly at every damaging impact. This will probably be less of a problem than the "[Moore's law]( of bitcoin, as this renders the hashrate half as useful every 6 months. It is between quotes as bitcoin's "Moore's law" states that hashrate doubles every 6 months, instead of [every 18-24 months]( in transistor progress for manufacturing chips.

You got this 32/3 from 128 bits in total divided by 12 words?
I thought about it later also [further down the thread]( and came to the conclusion was right, but for the wrong reasons^1.
^1 It is not that 'each word' makes the wallet 2048 times more secure since before applying the checksum that is 1/32th the length of the entropy, the entropy should be multiples of 32 bits. So the amount of words should be multiples of 3. However, for every exposed word it does reduce entropy with 2048, independent whether it is the last or the first word.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:38:27

Most of the times when I blow a chewing-gum bubble, it remains pretty decent and controlled. It pops fairly quickly, with my tongue I shove it back and re-chew it until I can blow another one. After a seemingly random amount of those, the bubble gets traction and I manage to fluff in a significantly larger volume of air. It feels amazing, if feels powerful and it seems like I am in total control of it, I almost have the feeling I am the smartest person on the planet. It grows larger and larger. For some reason however, after that bubble normally the fun ends and I feel like a morron.
I'd say those initial bubbles are temporary bubbles, and the last is definitely less temporary, just because you can blow it longer and it sticks with you for the rest of ~~your life~~ the day.

I like the fact you can bury it somewhere in the ground or in a less controlled environment.

I ignored the fact that the last was a checksum indeed. 
Ignoring that, and assuming it is a standard 12-word pass phrase it reduced the entropy to not less than 110 bits. This seems more than enough for such a wallet (chances are higher that someone accidentally makes a picture of the steel wallet when in use than that someone is willing to brute-force 110 bits for a low amount).
Does exposing the checksum reduce the entropy by more than 11 bits? Interesting question.
*thinking out loud:*
[11 bits exposed] + [110 bit not exposed] + [7 bits exposed + 4 checksum bits exposed]
The 4-bit checksum is equal to the first 4 bits of the SHA256 hash of the first 128 bits of entropy. Brute-forcing the remaining 110 bits could potentially be optimized by calculating the SHA256 hash of the first 128 bits and checking whether the first 4 bits are equal to the checksum. This way you can discard 15 out of 16 attempts just because it doesn't have the correct checksum. Assuming this is a free operation, it reduces the 110 bits of remaining entropy to 106 bits.
How long does that take to brute-force? Probably longer than the average marriage.
EDIT: nonetheless, besides telling the recipient of the steel wallet it was (partially) reddit-funded (thanks for that!), I will also tell them they can better not wait too long moving the funds. It's the price they have to pay for this post.

From the title I assumed the whole point of the article was to debunk exactly this point. Bitcoin is seen as a Ponzi scheme because from the outside it looks like one. If you don't know what it is, you just see: "People that get/got in earlier, earn shitloads of money because people also buy in later (The greater fool theory). The later you get in, the worse the price 'and the more you can lose'." 
The fact that the quantity of Bitcoin is finite does no do anything to debunk this, yet the author uses this authoritative statement without any argumentation to debunk Bitcoin as a scam.

My idea here was to make a ranking of wallet security from low (exchange) to high ('cryo' storage). Each type has its own features (checkbox) and basic level of security (indicated how high of low it is placed). The security can be improved using security enhancing practices (blue arrows) or security decreasing practices (red arrows), the height of the increase/decrease makes the wallet more/less secure. I tried to have a realistic step size of these in comparison with other wallet security levels.

My intention was to sketch the following: Hardware wallet has reasonable security level if you use the [plausible deniability feature]( If you don't use it, the security lowers (indicated with red arrow pointing down) since you will have a hard time beating the $5 wrench attack.
I already figured that the low-high security rating wasn't clear from the infographic based on other feedback. In my next attempt I will make it clearer. I thought of making an scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high) and indicate it better on this scale instead of 'in the air'.

And remember that 'trust' in this network is not the trust as in 'I trust my money with you', but rather a trust that the people on my UNL will not collude against me. Considering bitcoin people, I would definitely chose in my UNL people like Jihan and luke-jr, add to that the Pope, an anti-semitist, and the head of a university, and you have yourself a quite good chance of them not colluding against you. Then think of 25 or 100 of these very different entities, and you are way, way more decentralized than bitcoin will ever be.

Consensus of 80% is needed in order to close a ledger. If it doesn't reach that, it cannot close a ledger, i.e. can't continue the block chain. 
Related to infiltrating as majority validators I don't see a difference between ripple and bitcoin. If you control the majority of validators you cannot just steal funds as you need to sign the transactions. As a validator you only validate transactions (or not), so the best you can attack is to halt transactions. Since you can't sign others transactions, you'll have to rewrite the protocol in order to steal funds. At that moment you are incompatible with the other validators anyway and honest people and exchanges won't accept you funds. Your only option is also controlling an exchange node/validator. But that is similar as hacking an exchange. 
If you manage to own 80% of the 'globally' trusted validators, you can only halt. It will be clear soon which are the malicious validators. The honest validators individually change their UNL accordingly (according to who they trust after knowing which are the malicious ones), and they can continue with 25 validators. You will be stuck with 75 nodes having their own 'forked' block chain if they manage to proceed. 
As long as you are on the same trust network as the  entities/persons you need to trust, you are OK.

It was to be expected. You can't get mass adoption without people or banks scamming or monetizing the hype. 
Maybe even in the near future people think it was a mistake from Satoshi to only create 21M of them and the general population is OK with fractional banking of bitcoin (certificates) because there are just too few of them, and the majority of them is held (ransom) by nerds and geeks, asking way too much for them.

Thanks for the reply!
I think the level of trust that is needed is similar as what we see now with bitcoin and the UASF. In the end you shouldn't care too much about 'malicious' actors. The only things you need(*) is to be able to trust 'the economy'. I am not too familiar with the bitcoin jargon, but in bitcoin's UASF/BIP148 case you (assuming you support BIP148) want the entities that are important to you to support BIP148. If they do, you can safely send/use bitcoins there. If your Trezor is on a different fork than your exchange, you will have problems (don't hit me on the details). If they are on the same fork, it is safe.
Similar to Ripple, you want that the entities that you use to be on the same network of trust. And as long as the entities on the trust-network do not collude against you, you are fine and can spend your funds safely between them. As a regular user, you can stimulate these entities to stay honest by running a validator yourself and put them (if you trust them not to collude against you) on the UNL.
IF they get bribed and for example reject your payments, consensus is halted and the blockchain does not proceed (no risk of funds) until consensus is reached after the trust network is restored (i.e. the bad actors removed). If the bad actors form a network of themselves, let them do that, no-one will want to use that network anyway. That is why attempting to bribe a majority also is not profitable, as you can disrupt the progress of the blockchain once, and then you lost trust and you are not on people UNL's anymore.
Similar to changing to code. This also requires the validators to agree on it.
(*) In bitcon's case this is NOT all you need as without majority of hashing power, you can get attacked by the other network.

Define centralized?
[Currently 25 validators]( that each trust their own set of other validators. Exchanges that trade XRP run their own validator.

If you are in a train and you know you will arrive at your destination in a long time from now (e.g. 2:10 hours) every 10 minutes you can look out the window to be extremely thrilled that the train is moving forward and exceptionally disappointed when it is slowing down, and in-between the checks you constantly think about it. But after doing this for long enough you know it would actually be better you spend your time on more useful things, like building things, working on relationship, etc. However, changing the one behaviour into the other, even when being fully aware of this, is easier said than done. This was the problem/solution I was referring to.

The graphs show for a specific time-window what the return on investment was if you would have started on a random day (any day between now and September 2011). Since there are a lot of days that you could have started, it shows using the different lines the historic distribution of this ROI.
The red line (50th percentile) shows the median value of this ROI, purple the minimum and blue the maximum. It shows e.g. that if your investment time-window was more than 3.4 years there has not been a loss.

It is blockchain/ledger agnostic. It's goal is to remove the boundaries between blockchains/ledgers. So it doesn't matter on what blockchain the sender and receiver are on, as long as the blockchains/ledgers are Interledger (ILP) connected. The payment route then automagically goes via the cheapest or fastest or most compliant path (whichever you choose).
Two weeks ago they did a payment demo from sender to receiver that crossed seven blockchains/ledgers in one transaction (!)

If Bob has 1 BTC on bitcoin blockchain and wants to send say 2500 USD to Alice that only has a bank account at bankA; Bob just sends her the 2500 USD and Interledger will figure out how she gets it.
This path can e.g. go from BTC -&gt; BTC/USD.bankA on exchangeB -&gt; USD.bankA on bankA, but can have many more/different hops in between (e.g. ETH or XRP)
