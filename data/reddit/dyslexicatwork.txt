The fee is documented at length; they aren't trying to hide it.
Also, the software market has been moving away from the one-time charge for quite a while now. Developers are exploring their options. Again, don't like their decisions? Don't use their products.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:32:09


You don't. The use of this free software is completely voluntary. Don't like it? Use something else.
Software development is work. It's not like they are being shady about the fees.

Not sure if your tip jar is empty, or if the lack of a space between 350 and bits confused changetip. Haha. It's the thought that counts! I appreciate it. :]

I personally think that Schiff is holding BTC, regardless of what he says. Screaming "it's a bubble!" while buying could prove quite profitable.

Oops, my mistake. I'm at work and didn't actually read the wiki article, which caused me to make some erroneous assumptions. Sorry for that. Anyway, bits are being adopted to encourage adoption. Whether you're a bitcoin fan or not ~$300 for a single unit of a currency puts a lot of people off, especially when they don't know that they're extremely divisible.

Not only this, but blockchain technology allows direct accountability. One person, one vote. Voter-fraud would be next-to-impossible with the transparency this sort of system could provide.
@_date: 2014-11-04 13:02:49
You need to expand the timeframe you're using to analyze the price; anything less than three years is just noise. As for the Zimbabwe currency, you're drawing parallels where none exist.

Spoken like someone who wasn't there in the beginning. Sending an email was most CERTAINLY more complicated then than it is now. There was no GUI. Good email clients, and web interfaces were secondary to the development of the protocol. Tell me, have you ever connected directly to an SMTP server and sent it raw commands in order to send an email? 
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:21:56
Because the Zimbabwe dollar has lots of zeros due to inflation. BTC vs bits is more like a stock split; It has the same valuation, just different numbers.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:59:06
Yeah. Somehow the mouse always wins.






@_date: 2015-05-06 17:29:03
Which is exactly why is was an **obvious** scam from the beginning. Anyone that thought a $20 hard floor could be magically maintained probably just got a lesson in markets.

If you hold your private keys then the dream is alive and well; if you don't hold your private keys then it's not your bitcoin.

If bitcoin's potential is realized, the final valuation is going to be unimaginably bonkers.

@_date: 2015-05-12 14:41:52
I agree.




To me spells an endgame where so much is done with bitcoin that the valuation quite literally encompasses the entirety of the global wealth.
Then again, maybe I just spend too much time on reddit. ~_^

I hardly notice the speed decrease, even with multiple users with multiple devices in the household. Most services don't even serve data as fast as I was capable of downloading with the 105mb plan. The only time the speed difference is noticeable is when downloading a torrent or a game through Steam; but even then, it's not terrible.

I highly recommend trying Fold if you haven't already. You'll get a larger discount and the same cup of coffee. :)

Like the man or not, he's right. A hard cap that can just be hit again some time in the future is a band-aid, not a fix. The blocksize limit needs to be elastic.

This statement has always stood out to me as a hint to something significant. What sort of environment must he have been working in, why was the network configured in such a way (usually done for security from outside attacks), and why didn't he have access to the network settings?

I never meant to come across as calling all of the investors dumb or foolish. Not my intent at all. I'm sure a lot of honest people were roped in by this scam. What I meant was: When the "$20 floor" was crashed through and never saw again, there is a lesson to be had. And any seasoned investor would know that a hard-floor can't really exist.

Oh, get the sand out of your pants. Maybe they've been wanting to implement it for a while and decided to take advantage of the downtime to do it. Stop spinning this great news and fantastic advancement in order to make it seem negative.

Very true. It's a very nerve-wracking thing. I used an offline PC for key generation/signing for several months, which is a pain. Now I have a trezor and I cannot help but notice the nagging voice in the back of my head that says "Can you trust the trezor's RNG?"
Still better than leaving my coins on an exchange, though.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:17:25
I need to look into this. That said, do you know how *hard it was* to buy the Trezor instead of just more bitcoin?! :)

I recently bit the bullet and upgraded to Comcast's business class. I was paying for the "Extreme 105" (105mb) residential plan, and switched to the 50mb business class with no data cap; it works out to less speed and no cap for about $23 more a month. It comes with a few perks like *actual* customer support, under 24 hour response/repair time, and a domain name. I don't know that it's really worth it, but it's my only option for unlimited bandwidth until Google brings the real competition to the scene.

Trucoin worked for a while, but has since stopped operating. The only way I know of, without paying a premium through an otc market, is to register a credit card with Coinbase or Circle.

I'm fairly certain that the private keys to those 1m Satoshi coins have been destroyed. Satoshi knows that simply moving those coins would spell the doom of his experiment, so he's probably made it impossible to get to them. Then again, maybe not.

"If you have a hardware wallet you wish to use with Multibit, plug it in now." 
Asking the question isn't redundant if the user doesn't know beforehand that they are answering a question by not having their hardware wallet plugged in at the right time. You really shouldn't decide against informing the user...

Incorrect. Even Bitpay has said that some merchants are keeping a portion of their BTC sales in Bitcoin.
You're getting burried because you're making baseless claims.
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:26:57
No. I don't know how many clients are keeping bitcoin, nor do I what percentage they maintain in BTC. 
No. It's not a "nightmare" for tax and accounting; there are several platforms that will help with this process.
No. That is not why bitpay exists.

The font is certainly not minimalist or easy on the eyes. I'd recommend changing it to a simple Sans Serif font.
Edit: The font is actually fine on the logo/left side. However, I'd definitely change the navigation font.

The blockchain is transparent. In this case, everyone involved would be able to actually SEE where the money is and who has it. Not to mention she would have had to explicitly authorized the payments in the first place, and she wouldn't have paid twice to begin with.

3. Right-click the offending link
4. Click "Remove this Permanently"
5. Leave everyone else alone.

The Blockchain is still transparent. In this case, the institutions and my coworker would be able to consult the distributed global ledger and resolve the problem.

Just a few reasons to NEVER use Cryptsy:
    1. They are shady as hell
    2. Terrible mess of a database (allows negative balances to happen)
    3. Their support is terrible
    4. Their site and matching engine is awful and cannot handle hardly any volume
    5. They lock accounts
    6. They hide their misdoings (like wiping OPs transfer out page)
    7. They allow their employees to sign official correspondence with internet handles
    8. Did I mention they are shady as hell?
    9. And lastly, there are MUCH better exchanges with more options
It's really remarkable that Craptsy still exist.

Thanks for your response. It does seem like refunding the money to the client and then working it out the discrepancy amongst themselves makes the most sense. I cannot fathom why they have been jerking her around for so long.
If you have any tips that may light a fire under the customer service, I can relay the message to her.
