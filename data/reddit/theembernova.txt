I know people who've only invested into it because they honestly believe Bitcoin's revolutionary and something that can change the world. I'm not completely sold, but it's nice to think about in a time like this.

It's hard to step back and think sometimes, but once you realize there's another human on the other side of that computer screen, admitting faults becomes much easier.

Wise decision, get out while you still have your money and dignity.

Ahahhah, that's almost as bad as McLovin'.

Classic pump'n'dump.

Basically asking for upvotes. A huge no-no.

Thank you for the clarification, if my comment came out as confrontational I apologize.

"How to indoctrinate your kids into something they don't understand."
Isn't that how religion works, OP? You're making Bitcoin look more and more like a cult. You're no better than them. Not only that, your entire account revolves around blogspam from your shitty site.

Suicide isn't a joke, please don't downplay it with accusations of trolling. [I'm certain that many people who've invested in Bitcoin have lost quite a lot of money, to the point where they may be considering suicide as an option.](

Oh look, Godwin's law in effect. In an about an hour, too.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:44:22
And completely disregard the possibility that some people in this community may be contemplating suicide? No, sorry, I don't think so.
I also see you've changed your post from "Please get the fuck out" to "This post is so embarrassing."
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:45:42
Unfortunately, yes. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:32:01
Someone's in denial.
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:55:54
No it isn't.

I've yet to see a person tip an entire Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:01:20
Because no one wants your penny-shavings that badly.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:37:21
You're implying that posters in don't care for Bitcoiners as fellow humans, in which case you're truly mistaken. I wouldn't wish for the death of anyone, regardless of whatever harmless activities they choose to pursue.

Enjoy your shadowban.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:03:28
As opposed to this sub, where circlejerking is practically encouraged? Yeah, okay.
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:38:30
You must be incredibly ignorant to value accusations of "trolling" over the life of a fellow human being. Shame on you.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:02:05


That desperate to justify your losses, huh?
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:30:38


Pick one.

Just accept that it's failing. "Muh manipulation" can't be your little scapegoat for ever.
