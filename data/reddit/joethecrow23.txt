I think it's insane.

It was a tasty dip today.

I've been buying every week for months now. I'm sitting on .36

If it does I'll become a whole coiner much sooner than I'm on course for

Current dip is bumming me out because I have a move coming up and need to hoard USD at the moment

Me too! Thanks Bloomberg!

If you really need the money, sell. If you don't, don't.

Anybody use one of those apps that rounds your credit/debit purchases up to the nearest dollar and buys BTC with the change? Any recommendations on which to use?

I have just bought all I can afford to buy for the next few weeks. And I was pumped to do it.

I hope that was a carne asada burrito.

I just don't understand the thought process by Roger here. I'm by no means an expert, but I do business with a guy who has been balls deep in crypto for years now. He tells me that BCH is great as far as the tech goes. So if that's the case why does Roger keep resorting to these straight up fraudster tactics? WTF? He's hurting the rep of not only BTC but what should be a nice coin in BCH\(I could be totally wrong on that\) as well. Is he just a scumbag who simply can't help himself?  If BCH is good tech why does he resort to Bitconnectesque stratagems?

We will soon be seeing panhandlers with cardboard BTC addresses on street corners and outside your local Sunoco!

Thank you very much!

Started buying last December and just kept buying. 
Every time I buy on coinbase I transfer it to my desktop wallet. Am I doing it right?

The fact that you are thinking about investing this $100 at age 14 is indicative to me that you are going to be just fine regardless of how you spend it.
