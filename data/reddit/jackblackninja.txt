Alright, my bad for engaging you on that one. Should have just left it alone, I suppose.
It still stands that in your initial comment, though I feel like you went about it in an outstandingly petty way (your comments look like something right out of middle school!), you were apparently trying to disagree that the issues that prevent bitcoin being a usable currency have been around only for a few months.
[The mempool]( has taken a hit three times in direct correlation with the attacks on bitcoin, starting in May, and [the average transaction fee]( has only gotten rough since November. Would you argue that bitcoin is going to fetter out into a dying store of value without advancing, returning to where it was a few months ago and progressing to better places?

I've invested at 1,600, 2,400, 5,800, 8,000, and 13,000. I've been invested for 7 months, and I've been tempted to panic sell when I started to lose money only to watch it sky rocket a month later.. and things happen much more quickly now. There hasn't been a dip longer than like a week. I've actually lost money trying to sell at higher and rebuy lower because the lows are so short. I would discourage trying to do that. Like I said, it also has steep tax implications.
I would recommend trying to get in before Christmas if you can. Go ahead and try to get verified with Gemini or GDAX, regardless of if you are going to buy, just so if you do buy, you don't have to wait a week to get verified and watch the price rise. Coinbase is a good option if you have to use it.
And you are right, in fact it might hit a million before the end of next year. That entails A LOT of change and events, but I fully believe bitcoin is capable. And if it's not I also fully believe it will be due to another cryptocurrency taking over, not cryptocurrencies as a whole stopping progress and becoming less useful. That's sort of what confuses me when people talk about bubbles. I just don't see them becoming less useful and therefore overpriced, quite the opposite.
Watch youtube vids and read here and r/BitcoinMarkets for education, [check out this speculative chart]( watch Andreas Antonopoulos, and read this even if you can't grasp it, it's the thing that started the whole show:
One last note: no one knows shit for sure, only invest money you can loose (though I give you my word, for whatever it means, that bitcoin isn't going far down any time soon), plan not to panic sell, and plan to hold it for over a year if you can.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:23:51

Anytime you sell bitcoin at a profit in US dollars it is a taxable event. So depending on how long you've held, where it came from (trading, mining, gift, income), and what tax bracket you are in for capital gains taxes, you have to pay capital gains taxes every year based on how much you've earned when selling. If you lose money that can also be accounted for up to a few thousand dollars back. Not often the case with bitcoin. Anyone with more expertise please step in if I am off base with anything.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:33:33
No, the inoperable fees and mempool back up.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:33:07
No, you should do it through GDAX or Gemini if you can get verified because coinbase will rape you with fees just for being convenient. But if you have to go with coinbase, that's a good option too, just hefty fees.
Only invest when you are ready to hold it. Whenever you sell, regardless of if you made profit or loss, capital gains taxes apply to it depending on what income bracket you fall under and how long you've held it for. Judging from your post, you would probably not have to pay any taxes if you hold for over 12 months. So yeah. But what's the best 20 bucks can do? Turn into 40? 200? Use it like a long term savings... do your research, invest when you can, and earn (maybe lose in the short term) value in the interim.

I don't really listen to his music, but my friends do I've seen some really great interviews with the guy. He is pretty sharp, obviously enjoys the gangster persona but it also earns him millions. He got a 34 on the ACT and always seems to have informed opinions on topics on talk shows. Wouldn't surprised me at all if he knew what Bitcoin was, and though I can't confirm that (although come on, you think it is more likely his publicist told him to write HODL??) I would assume he does before I learned he is ignorant about it.

I have no idea what the purpose of capital gains taxes is in the first place (because what the hell do they have to do with how I earn my money?) and I would LOVE for someone with more adept knowledge about this to step in.
But as far as I can tell, it's pretty much a tax for doing business in the USA, and that applies for everything. If you buy a bike and sell it to your neighbor for a profit, that's taxable income and technically illegal not to claim. Of course there is no way they could find out and they would not give a shit anyway, but when it comes to billions of untaxed gains, they care.. a lot. This is the purpose for the litigation between the IRS and Coinable that has been ongoing.
As far as taxes go, I am all about sensible taxation and the common good and unity they try to instill. People in the US seem to hate taxes, but we pay FAR lower taxes (in most areas) than other first world countries, and our infrastructure huge income disparity (which is worsened by most states tax codes) show for it. No affordable, much less socialized, health care, not much affordable, much less free, post-secondary education, fucking ATROCIOUS public transportation in the vast majority of the country, etc. America does so much right, but it fucks up so obviously in ways that other countries have dealt with form the start. Taking cues from other nations, especially in regard to taxes, could make us so, so much better.
So, I am going to pay my capital gains. As far as taxes go, capital gains seem to be bullshit, but I'm not fucking around with owing thousands later on, and all in all I am very much in favor of taxation. Though that system is so terribly fucked up in this country.
All I would say, is that if you don't plan on paying the taxes, hold your bitcoin for at least a year before selling. That way you pay 0% or 10% taxes on those gains. So, if the IRS comes at you later, it isn't about skipping on 35%-50%.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:14:07
Yeah that's a good point, it's not usable as a currency in small quantities right now. In that case, for smaller transactions, I would say it's a failing currency. But a month ago it was fine, and I sincerely hope that in another month we will see real progress with solutions that have been in the works for a while, because while I understand we have to get the solution right, we can't wait too long.
With that said, there are a bunch of other cryptos that are doing it right for small transactions like litecoin, monero, and, in many ways, bcash. The reason those are not what everyone immediately switches to, and the reason that bitcoin is being plagued with attacks at all, is because BTC is still the dominant, though faltering, crypto-currency. On one hand it has gotten to this point because of it's structure, team, and support base, but that has also caused it problems that it must be able to solve not only correctly, but also quickly, for it to remain. And I think it will. But if it somehow didn't, it sure as shit wouldn't be something like bcash that would be able to handle taking the position as top dog, at least not unless they became truer to what most of their constituent base wants them (and any crypto) to be.

Yerp, but I would absolutely define it as a currency as well, though it's not exactly equatable to the fiat most governments operate with, and that wasn't exactly equatable with gold and the material goods markets it replaced.

GDAX is the market platform behind coinbase. They just realized there was a demand for a super simple platform that wasn't as scary to new users as normal trading markets like GDAX, Gemini, etc. so they do that but upcharge you for it. If you are young you may not be able to verify your identify via GDAX (because you don't have government records like a credit score) so I would recommend Gemini or the easy to use Coinbase, both are very reputable.

I am against all significant injustices, like inhumane treatment of animals, but just because it's on my mind I hope I might provide some good info, because I take it you don't know a ton about the cartels. In all honestly I think it is important to know, because it will give you an intense and abject understanding of the bad out there, and the reality of (as opposed to the mere potential for) human suffering. You learn about things like the animal abuse, holocaust, or ISIL, or militant groups in Africa, but it is hard to feel a true sense of agency towards them because one is typically far removed, especially if you are American.
But man, Mexico is our neighbor, full of culture and relevance, and corruption and suffering of absolutely equal weight to the other things I have mentioned. It will change your perspective, hopefully in a beneficially realistic way, assuming you haven't already come into INTIMATE contact with the depths of the immorality present in our world, in our backyard everyday. And so I highly recommend reading wikipedia and articles about it, but I would say only watch videos (particularly live leak) if you want to really change your understanding of pain. But if you can handle it, it will help broaden your perspective in a good, realistic way.
Though currently impossible we need a fucking superhero force for good, from insects to dogs to humans, to prevent deep suffering. Such an effective and terrible evolutionary adaptation.

Yes, unfortunately bitcoin will always have volatility, at least given it's current protocol. You would probably need the protocol for an algorithmic central bank built into the coin from the start. Actually that's like the first question on the [Basecoin FAQ]( The whole page is very interesting and worth looking into.
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:37:54
Aha, that helps a lot. So, it is unusual for data to be reported to the IRS by anyone but the individual, save for during an audit (which, I would assume, happens when they have justification to believe underreporting is occurring) or when certain thresholds are breached. If you are correct in saying that most people do not underreport (which generally seems right to me), then I am surely not even considering advocating for blanket IRS reporting.
Still, as you point out, there are situations that justify automatic reporting or an audit. This is where I think you read my understanding for why the IRS would ask for records from crypto exchanges for advocating for blanket IRS reporting. I am of the understanding that [crypto gains have indeed been underreported]( and that is what spurred the IRS to take it to court.
I am not advocating that there should be paradigm shift and crypto exchanges must always automatically report their customers data to the IRS, but hasn't the IRS been totally justified in their actions thus far? I certainly understand being wary and not wanting to move in the direction of assumed guilt, but this seems to be a case of clear-cut justification, and that crypto exchanges haven't been getting unfair treatment. If they have I want to know, and it would change my outlook on this. If it is more a fear of things going in the wrong direction, I think that is completely validated as well.

It shouldn't go without saying that there has been work on stable, independent, decentralized currencies since Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek in the 70's, and it has been intensified by the advent of cryptocurrencies.
Currently, it really comes down to collateralization. You can collateralize to other currencies, which is the easiest option, but then it wouldn't be really be independent (even if it were still decentralized).
You could also collateralize with the future value of the coin through a price stabilizing protocol that offers seigniorage to the next coins when the price drops, raising demand and therefore price again because it offers an easy way to make money. This of course requires widespread adoption and steady use, otherwise people would not stand to gain money from the seigniorage. When the demand and price rise too high, more coins are produced to increase supply to overcome the demand and lower the price. It's been a heavily discussed type of stablecoin since Robert Sam's paper on it and Basecoin is the leading figure.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:47:51
Wait don't we want exchanges to furnish 1099K's? As it stands, it's mostly us to figure it all out, and it seems to me that exchanges should help customers out and make paying taxes streamlines, just like any other business.
Or was that statement couched in a larger point about not wanting to pay taxes, or tax rates being too high? I would love some talk about that on this subreddit, if that's indeed what you were going for.

Damn man, I agree that we should focus inwardly, but from drug prohibition (which today's cartels were born out of) to climate change (which America is the leading contributor to and causes deaths in other countries daily, like the floods in Asia and India) we have an intense effect on the world around us that we shouldn't shun. I mean working out our own issues could even go hand in hand with it.
Nationalism has it's benefits, like improving the lives of those inside the country, but can also lead to selfish interests... such as the U.S. doing what it can to control the dollar and keep it's value (not just price) above others so that it can effectively impose sanctions (and I'm not saying this is totally bad, but has more selfish and outwardly negative effects that positive), or strict immigration laws. And what are strict immigration laws if not shunning others out of fear and self interest. Again, it has plenty of value and positive effects to be had, but there are so many more negatives that come to my mind.
Many issues in our country and in others could be better solved through acting together as a global society, but people are afraid and nationalism (from tribe to city-state to state to country to species) has always been strong, and inherently selfish.

Let me preface this by saying I am a novice to tax code, tax reporting, and how the IRS handles them, and I am interested in furthering that understanding.
So we have a capital gains tax code, but it seems to me that if the IRS had no record of the account history, and it was only up to the individual to report it, then not only would people far underreport their earnings, but the IRS would also have no way to confirm that what the individual did report was correct.
I have no frame of reference, but I would have guessed that the IRS gets records from every other financial institution or instrument to verify and avoid this problem.

It isn't ever used to explain the mechanisms of lightnight protocol because the word token typically refers to a publicly offered and priced object.

Damn straight man. I love bitcoin, I love blockchain, and I am sure that they will be integral to the future of business. However, they must be stable. Unfortunately, bitcoin will not see stability unless there are huge changes to its protocol that would necessitate such a hard fork that it would really no longer be bitcoin, it would be 2.0. While I see this as a possibly, bitcoin has value in not being stable. With the design of its deflationary protocol, even though it will still be liable to huge downward price movements, it may continuously move in the upward direction. Relatively fine for bitcoin, and it would continue to have value, but it would not instill it as the most effective exchange commodity.
A stable coin needs a protocol that acts as a price regulator in itself in order to maintain decentralization. Basecoin is the leader in this model and I would highly recommend keeping a keen eye on them over the next decade. There are tons of models for stability, but after doing a research project on the options, it seems clear that Basecoin has the best protocol. The only thing they are missing is mass adoption, which is a problem for all cryptos, but would actually stabilize the price of Basecoin instead of shoot it upwards only to still be liable to heavy volatility.
My paper then offered the solution of a global tax body that collected taxes from privileged things (such as the airline ticket taxes in France or a million other) and then uses them to help disadvantaged countries, which is a positive for them but also every economy offering the taxes. It is often discussed in global policy because of these huge moral and economical benefits, but the main issue is corruption, which makes it hard to bring to full benefits of the taxes, much less actually track them. It would be rife with issue that make it currently infeasible. Cryptocurrencies offer tons of solutions here. Moreover, a global tax forum would add consistent and huge demand for a stable coin, which is the one thing they lack to be effective. I wonder if basecoin or any of the prominent figures in global policy and justice have considered this. If not I feel kinda cool to have had a novel idea, but even more distressed that it isn't being discussed.

I'm no expert and want to hear how I might better understand, but what how does merely wide scale adaption grant stability? There is no stable currency without regulation, and bitcoin does not have a robust enough protocol to do anything other be deflationary to try to push the price, relative to whatever you please in right direction.
What does 1btc=1btc have to do with its price, which, to have substantive value, must inherently be related to other objects of value? How could 1btc≠1btc?
Also, my point is that with both a sufficient protocol, which it lacks (why do you think we need lightning? B/c bitcoin is imperfect and emergent), and steady use (which it clearly also lacks), it can achieve stability - they are both necessary conditions. I think we both agree on that though
I'm just not sure bitcoin can do it without huge amendments to it's protocol that would make it something evolved to categorize it as a different type of coin than it has been designed to be.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:31:30
There is lots of substance in his point, but his way of making it was fucking valueless. What I wish he would have mentioned is what it would mean for other financial instruments, be it government fiat or other crypto currencies, and what it would mean for bitcoin. BTC still hasn't and will likely never solve the problem of stability. Even with full-blown adoption it wouldn't be stable, and that it a huge problem. My guess is that maybe it will hit 250k but full-scale adoption and use of a cryptocurrency would require stability, which I cannot fathom a way to produce with bitcoin. It would require a stable coin like Basecoin that uses it's protocol to act as a central regulatory bank to ensure steady price. However, that would require both large scale adoption and steady and continuous demand and growth.
