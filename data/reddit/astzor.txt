Malicious Exit Nodes are nodes that perform deanonymization attacks on users. This can range from logging all traffic, to perform sslstrip-based attacks, to issue mitm ssl certificates, etc,.
Although the TorProject does a great job of getting rid of them, its always safer to just stay in the Tor network.
Setting up a hidden service only takes a couple of seconds, it just mirrors your web server.

Things to keep in mind: America has a obesity problem, does banning forks and spoons solve the problem?
